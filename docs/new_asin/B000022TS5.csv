1249258,4,B000022TS5,"I was really surprised how well the hi-def picture was for for a 1997 straight-to-VHS movie.  This looks MUCH better than the Mask of the Phantasm Blu-Ray.

The movie itself is good, but doesn't feel as ""theatrical"" as some of the other Batman animated movies.  It's more or less an extended episode, and in a way serves as a decent finale for the original Batman: The Animated Series.

The best part of this disc is that they include ALL of the Mr. Freeze appearances from Batman: The Animated Series, The New Batman Adventures, and Batman Beyond, with a guide on the back giving you a watch order.  These episodes are in standard-def, but still look better than the DVD's they released a while back.  There are some really cheesy early-2000's DVD extras included that are almost laughable at this point, but its nice they included them for the sake of completeness.

Overall, a recommended buy on Blu-Ray, even if you already own the DVD.",1522281600,4,940,4.695121951219512
1249259,5,B000022TS5,"Ordered this awhile back and finally got around to watching them. I was glad I found this double feature version instead of buying them individually. Packaged arrived on time & no damage. Both movies are great. However, these movies are now available on Blu-ray which at the time I purchased them were not available. The DVD versions looked fine to me and I see no reason to upgrade to Blu-ray if you already own these on DVDs. The reviews between the two versions seem to be mixed, either way you'll enjoy them. Also, whether it's the Blu-ray or DVD version they both have the same special features.",1522195200,,600,4.616822429906542
1249260,5,B000022TS5,"Two great films.  Batman the animated series, was one of the best on television. Everything about from the animation to the voices to the music. Whenever they become available in blu; I'm there!",1522108800,,194,4.878787878787879

1249262,4,B000022TS5,"Batman & Mr. Freeze: Subzero is a spin-off of Batman: The Animated Series and a sort of sequel to the theatrical feature Batman: The Mark of the Phantasm. It takes place after Victor Fries (aka, Mr. Freeze) was exiled to the Arctic. While trying to save his wife from a rare disease, his lab is destroyed by a submarine. This sends Mr. Freeze back on a crime spree, returning to Gotham City to kidnap the only person  Barbara Gordon (Batgirl)  whose blood and tissue types match his wifes for a transplant. Unless Batman and Robin can rescue her in time, Batgirl will die in an illegal heart operation.

This animated film is faithful to the original comic book source material rather than to the live-action Batman & Robin, one of the weakest entries in the Batman franchise. This marks the final appearance of Dick Grayson, who would soon be promoted to Nightwing. Robin gets some good moments including a nifty stunt-filled motorcycle chase, but Mr. Freeze is the movies primary focus. Rather than being portrayed as pure evil, Mr. Freeze, the former Victor Fries, turns to crime primarily to save his wifes life. His slide into the dark side is motivated not by personal gain, but by spousal devotion, so theres an underlying sadness to his nefarious deeds.

Even though the story is told in animated form, director Boyd Kirkland provides the characters with distinct personalities, human flaws, and depth. Because the story is foremost, the movie is more intelligent and involving than many direct-to-video cartoon features.

Special materials on the unrated Blu-ray release include the featurettes Art of Batman: Music Montage and Get the Picture: How to Draw Batman; 4 episodes of Batman: The Animated Series, The New Batman Adventures and Batman Beyond featuring Mr. Freeze; and the theatrical trailer.",1522022400,2,1810,5.0

1249278,1,B000022TS5,"Subzero came off as a much too long animated series episode instead of it's own individual movie. What could have been a satisfying two part series ended up being a boring and unsatisfying mess. You could call the plot from being to end within minutes of watching it, They do nothing to further advance the arc of the character that is Mr. Freeze and try as they might to make him out to be sympathetic, He is still a bad guy. They should have come up with something new rather than his recycled ""Save Nora"" story line.",1498953600,,519,4.360824742268041

1249284,5,B000022TS5,"As a lifelong Batman fanatic, and someone who watched the Animated Series, you can imagine my surprise that I didn't know this movie existed before a few weeks ago. With the film move 15 years old at this point, I went into it expecting the style of the Animated Series, but had tempered expectations, given how far Batman storytelling has progressed on-film with the Nolan trilogy. I am thrilled to say those hesitant thoughts were unnecessary -- this was an incredible animated story.

I won't bother going into the plot details -- this movie has been around long enough. But it maintains a fresh and timeless quality to it with central themes of good vs. evil, love, and how far people will go to help someone. And as the title and cover suggest, you get a good look at Mr. Freeze, and elements of his psyche. The animation is very much the same as the Animated Series, and dates it back just slightly, but not enough to take away from the sheer excellence of this Batman and Robin (and Batgirl) adventure.",1494806400,5,1009,4.574585635359116

That said, this direct-to-DVD film over-relies on computer animation, attempting to blend it with traditional animation in several sequences in order to create a greater sense of scale. The blending, however, is poorly done in most cases. Though this did not have the budget of ""Batman: Mask of the Phantasm"" to create something that is visually gorgeous, the characters are all lovingly portrayed and this serves as a nice companion to the storytelling in ""The Animated Series.""",1468627200,4,623,5.24

1249346,5,B000022TS5,"As a huge Batman fan I actually missed this one when it originally came out because I was so focused on the ""Batman & Robin"" film which was extremely disappointing. As of late I have stayed away from live action Batman and have really been digging into the animated library and I must say SubZero is a true gem. The storyline here is much stronger than the live action, Victor Fries has more depth (as the character development was superior here) Most notably was the absence of cheesy lines from Mr. Freeze and the writers made me care about this character. I wish DC would have just released this instead of Batman & Robin. There are three reasons this movie left such a lasting impression on me 1) We didn't see much of Batman this time around (which was actually okay for me) mainly because the screenwriters/voice actors created such an emotional connection with Mr. Freeze that had me wanting him captured in the beginning but feeling sincere empathy for him & his wife later. For a Batman movie with rare screen time of the Caped Crusader, its nothing short of amazing that this film was able to keep my interest. 2) They didn't try to go overtop. There was never a time where something from the animated film reminded me of the live action or vice versa. I was able to accept both versions of the movie for what they are. This feature was great because I was able to understand Freeze's motivation behind his actions better than Batman & Robin. 3) Nobody felt out of place in this movie. Everybody served a purpose in helping push the story forward. Overall this movie was brilliant, I received it in 3 days, the voice acting is stellar & this further validates the reason Batman is the greatest superhero of all time. He has the best villains, most entertaining stories and ""where does he get those wonderful toys?"" 5 Stars",1440201600,2,1832,4.571428571428571

Well, this film gets nine.  I absolutely enjoyed it!  There is absolutely no doubt about that!  The story was great, Batman was great, the villains were great!  There's just one problem...
  My solitary negative thought is that I question if someone, even as cold-hearted as Mr. Freeze, would really go so far as to willingly kill someone for his frozen wife's sake.  There are other ways, even if many of those are illegal...I don't think legality is the frozen man's biggest concern.  Maybe it just requires a little suspension of disbelief, but I stop and think...maybe you won't.  I also wondered what the point of that Inuit boy was...he never really did anything except once...for like a second.  But he was all right, so I'll move on.

And though he doesn't appear too often, it's another Mr. Freeze story that delivers and touches you in a way. Him and Clayface, but more so him, are the only villains I have ever sympathized with.

I could go on in detail, but you probably get the idea if you're reading this in the first place. If you enjoy great animation, Batman, comic books, or just being entertained, you'll like this movie. And I'd have happily paid to watch this over any of the Nolan films.",1392940800,,726,4.377777777777778
1249415,3,B000022TS5,"This was the second of the Batman feature-length movies, released in 1998, following ""Mask of the Phantasm."" This was originally done for television, so it's in the standard 4:3 aspect ratio rather than widescreen.

The movie opens with an eerie journey through an underwater Arctic world, as a submarine wends its way under the ice cap. As the submarine passes, we see a man in shorts spear a fish and then head up through the ice to an Arctic cave with two pet polar bears and a young native lad. The man in shorts is, of course, Dr. Victor Fries, aka Mr. Freeze. He greets his wife, Nora, frozen in her containment vessel until a cure can be found for her.

Meanwhile, the submarine has reached its destination and begins to surface, planning to punch through the ice so that the scientists on board can gather specimens and data for research. Unfortunately, where they choose to surface is the middle of Victor's cave, The resulting upheaval overturns and destroys the capsule that was keeping Nora alive. Needless to say, Victor is not happy and he expresses his displeasure as only Mr. Freeze can.

The scene turns to Gotham, where Batman and Robin (Dick Grayson) are foiling a jewelry store robbery, as Alfred calls to remind them they are late for a party. Barbara Gordon is also late for the party, and we see why, as she stops a mugging in progress. At the party, Dr. Gregory Belson is talking to his stockbroker. He made some unwise investments in the market and he did it on margin, calls that are coming due in a few days. Unless something can be done, he's ruined.

On his way home from the party, Dr. Belson encounters snow and ice, just as the radio announces 90-degree weather. His car crashes and Mr. Freeze greets him as an old colleague, ""I've got a patient who needs you."" At Freeze's hideout, Belson delivers the bad news that the rupturing of the containment vessel caused Nora's ailment to resurface and she has only a couple of weeks to live, unless she gets an organ transplant. Belson sees an opportunity: he'll bypass all of the usual protocols and get her moved up on the waiting list but only if Freeze is willing to pay.

Unfortunately, when they check the records, they are unable to find any available organ that will match Nora's needs. At least no organ from someone who has recently died. Their only alternative is to use someone currently living. After searching the files, they find the ideal candidate: Barbara Gordon.

The rest of the movie runs in parallel tracks as Barbara tries to figure out why Freeze wants her and how she can escape after being kidnapped, while Batman and Robin race against time to figure out where is being held, by whom, and why. The two threads come together in an unusual location, as matters wend their way to a climactic conclusion.

The polar bears and the cute Eskimo boy were just a bit too much for me to believe and I think the story would have been better without them. I did like watching Batman put the various pieces together, as he worked out why Barbara was needed and where she was being held. There was a bit more luck involved than I would like but it was excusable. The animation was acceptable for its time, 16 years ago, but it looks a little dated today. The CGI sequences, in particular, were a little too obviously CGI and weren't that well integrated with the hand-drawn animation. The voice acting was good, with Kevin Conroy as Batman and Michael Ansara as Freeze notable standouts.

Overall, though, it felt more like this was a double episode of the Batman series than a movie, even a straight-to-video movie. After the really fine effort that was ""Mask of the Phantasm,"" that still holds up today, this was a pretty big disappointment. You should get this if you're a big fan of Mr. Freeze but, otherwise, I think this is one you can skip.",1392595200,,3836,4.58978102189781

1249423,4,B000022TS5,"If you're only exposure to the Batman villain Mr. Freeze was through Arnold Schwarzenegger's pun spouting portrayal then you owe it to yourself to see this villain done right. Mr. Freeze was a second rate gimmicky villain until the Batman Animated Series re-envisioned him as a conflicted and tortured man desperate to save his wife.  That's the version that's given here.

Freeze himself is in top form and there's also some really great bit given to Dick Grayson (Robin) and Barbara Gordon (Batgirl.) Gordon especially comes off very well and helps break so many of the stereotypes and clichs of girls in these sorts of stories. Batman himself isn't featured as heavily as one might think, but that isn't to the detriment of the final film.

The animation is gorgeous. The designs are in keeping with the animated series but with a clearly better budget allowing for some really stellar animated action scenes.

Really the only drawback is that the disc has essentially no bonus features. No making of, no interviews, not even a commentary. Just a cheesy ""game,"" a chance to see Batman get drawn in fast forward and trailers.",1390435200,5,1127,4.884816753926701

I think there was a couple of batmans, surprisingly movies that didn't have Kevin Conroy as voice actor that was a good story.  oops getting off subject.

1249443,3,B000022TS5,Decent Batman movie.  A bit more violence than I would like to see but not too bad.  It's Batman folks.,1386720000,,103,4.1
1249444,4,B000022TS5,"In an effort to save his dying wife, Nora, Victor Fries (aka Mr. Freeze) kidnaps Barbara Gordon, Commissioner Gordon's daughter because his wife needs an organ transplant and Barbara possesses the same rare blood type as his ailing wife. Batman and Robin are quickly hot on his tail and soon it's a game of cat and mouse between the Dynamic Duo and Mr. Freeze as our heroes seek to find Barbara before it's too late and she falls victim to Mr. Freeze's evil plan.

After the amazing thrill that was Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, and when I heard they were making another Batman animated movie, I was pumped. Mask of the Phantasm was insanely good and since SubZero was to be done in the same style by the same people, my expectations were high. While not as good as Phantasm, SubZero is still a solid flick. What makes it cool is it's a team-up movie because Batman's joined by Robin, something Phantasm didn't have. You also get to briefly see Batgirl in costume in this one as well.

Mr. Freeze is a tricky bad guy because while powerful, you take away his freeze gun and he's got nothing and it's easy to turn him into a one-trick-pony that way and diminish the complicated character that he is. Not in SubZero. You get to see Mr. Freeze for who he is under that armor and, well, he's just a heartbroken guy who's doing what he believes is the right thing. So distraught over his wife's fatal illness but brilliant enough to figure out a cure, he's willing to stop at nothing to save the woman he loves, even if that means killing an innocent person in the process. For those who have gone through immense heartbreak, you know how easy it is for unclear thinking to reign and how nothing but emotion takes over.

This flick also showed how Batman and Robin feed off each other and work together, and not in that ""Way to go, chum"" way that was the staple of the 1960s Batman series. You see two professional crime fighters playing off each other's strengths, giving each other ideas, each keeping the other encouraged and balanced as they fight the good fight.

There was also some 3D animation in this movie, back when 3D was a new thing. While the 3D parts didn't blend against the 2D as seamlessly as they do nowadays, it did add a ""wow"" factor to the flick--for its time--and kept Batman on the cutting edge of animation.

I'm really pleased with this movie and it gets better with each viewing, and with an ending that is both sad but satisfying, Batman and Mr. Freeze: SubZero is a Bat-movie that should be part of any Bat-fan's collection.",1384300800,,2548,4.482758620689655

My 6 and 8 years old boys enjoyed this cartoon but did not like the romantic elements as Robin and Batgirl dated and kissed albeit as their alter egos, Dick and Barbara. Furthermore, even though the subject matter was handled lightly it is rather deep and dark. Without giving too much away, the story covers gambling, kidnapping, death and possibly organ theft. Also, though the story gives some background on the characters it is assumed that you know about them before this quick paced movie as it glosses over the character's histories.

Overall, this is a good cartoon highlighting the entire BAT team in a fast and more developed story line than most superhero cartoons that may lead children to ask follow up questions.",1378425600,,789,4.801470588235294

Animation is mediocre and seemed of somewhat lesser quality than in the regular series episodes, despite the occasional CGI scenes.  But it's a decent enough story.  Easily my favorite part of it was the emphasis on jazz.  This series did a wonderful job of placing the story simultaneously in the future and the past with its mixture of sci-fi technology and noir-era designs and atmosphere, but this movie chose to add extra emphasis on the 30s and 40s feel with its musical selections.

It was intelligent, witty and thrilling.  This movie threw out everything that made Batman TAS good, and adopted the feel of a 70's Disney animation geared for 5-year-olds, as if an old geezer was pulling the strings on the director.  The pace is quite slow, and there is a lot of filler.  Batman's renowned detective work was reduced to connecting A to B with way to many dots.  Too slow for kids to adults, and too adult-themed for toddlers.  If I had never seen Batman TAS, I would be less harsh on this movie, but really, what happened?",1372982400,,692,4.540322580645161

All you really need is a basic understanding of Batman's world and the desire to see 2 great animated Batman stories.

Mask of the Phantasm is a look at Batman as a solo crimefighter, both in his early days as a vigilante and in his prime in modern Gotham City. Sub Zero expands the cast a bit more by including Robin and Batgirl and giving them equal parts in the story.

also both films are in full screen, they were originally in wide screen (after being drafted in full screen... long story)

I watched these films after watching through all of 'batman TAS' and 'the new adventures'

as for the movies, I really liked 'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm' and how it showed batman's beginnings.
Extremely well done. but there were no special features! no director commentary, no 'behind the film' or anything.

As for mr. Freeze sub zero, wasn't bad, I just did not find it very interesting, it felt just like any other mr. freeze episode, nothing special.
however the sub zero side of the disk came with special features (for sub zero only) very odd,
I'd rater had them add the specials for 'Mask of the Phantasm' as it was a much better film.

If you want to see both, I'd say rent subzero. and buy the widescreen version of 'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm'",1369958400,5,960,4.558139534883721

The soundtrack is fantastic and the story is griping from start to finish. I highly recommend this batman installment.

As a note, it is a very dark cartoon and may be scary for some kids. I have always felt this animated movie was more for adults than children. It is a true PG rating.",1367539200,,489,4.247311827956989
1249481,4,B000022TS5,"Batman Subzero is what Batman and Robin should have been. This movie, like Mask of The Phantasm, is a animated movie based on Bruce Timm's animated series. This movie is one of my favorite batman movies both animated and live action. It's in the top 10. Compare to Mask of the Phantasm, this film is kind of underwhelming, but a good film nevertheless.

Subzero is based on an episode of the animated series called Hearts in Ice, which centers around the villain Mr. Freeze. Like many incarnations in this universe this Mr. Freeze is my favorite incarnation of the character. In the old comics and in Batman and Robin he was a generic bad bad bent on world domination. In this movie, he is more of a tragic character. Freeze's wife has an incurable disease, and he is trying to come-up with a cure. This plot element is the driving factor for the film.

The other main characters were good as well. Kevin Conroy as Batman is always great. He is my favorite Batman. Robin was okay. Barbara Gordon/Batgirl is okay as well, though she is mostly the damsel in distress in this film. Her relationship with Robin was pretty nice.

The art and animation is great as usual. The score is good as well. Most of the music is from the animated series.

The problem that I have with this film, and that others might have as well, is that it is basically a rehash of Hearts in Ice. If you have watched the series and seen that episode, you might be a bit disappointed. It basically has the same plot as the episode except extended. This movie is not in the same league as Mask of the Phantasm. However, it is still a fun and entertaining movie. This movie did take itself seriously and treated the viewers like adults, unlike Batman and Robin.

Overall, this film is an example of what Batman and Robin should have been. I think it is criminal that this went straight to video, and Batman and Robin got into theaters.",1367280000,,1903,4.472622478386167

Unlike the movie version, this vision of Mr. Freeze is everything you want and expect him to be. He's emotionally driven despite his cold, emotionless exterior. The tragic story of Mr. Freeze's search for a cure for his wife concludes, but it's not the ending he hoped for. It's well written with a story that's compelling as it is heart wrenching. It also marks the beginning of a change in the overall look of the Batman animated universe. While still dark and ominous, it appeals more to the younger audience in appearance while the story still feels mature. Worth owning for any fan of the DCAU.",1366416000,,826,4.783216783216783

1249498,4,B000022TS5,"Growing up in the late 80s and early 90s Batman: The Animated Series (TAS) played a huge role on in my childhood. Batman TAS was the Batman I grew up with. I remember trying to catch every espisode of this cartoon, that I could. Batman TAS was a revolutionary carton and broke many barriers for its time, it's dark tone and atmosphere, and the fact that guns actually shot bullets (not laser beams) set this cartoon apart from most of the cartoons of this era, and the cartoons I grew up with. After a couple of years of dominating the TV, this series was ported to the Theatrical cartoon movie format with ""Mask of the Phantasm."" At the time Disney animated/musical features dominated this market, so it was cool and revolutionary to have something else to go see. I never saw this movie on the big screen and wish I had.

The Mask of the Phantasm deals with a vigilante, named The Phantasm, murdering key members of the Gotham criminal/ mob underworld. I do not want to give too much of the story away, but Batman has to deal with this character, in order to stop him, and avoid the blame that he himself is taking for the murders, due to the their relatively similar appearance. On top of that a love from Bruce's past has come back, and Batman faces the choice of either maintaining his crusade against crime or giving it all up to live a ""normal life"" with the woman he has always loved. The acting, animation, and writing are excellent, keeping with the quality of Batman TAS. This movie is kind of like Batman TAS's version of Long Halloween, which is pretty awesome.

Subzero, the second film in this set, was a direct to video release. Released during the ""New Adventures of Batman and Robin"" era of Batman TAS, this movie was released after Mask of the Phantasm, and to be honest I don't remember it much at all. Keeping with it's namesake, this movie centers around Mr. Freeze. In this story, Mr. Freeze who is living in the artic with his cryo-frozen wife, eskimo boy, and two polar bears, have their peaceful life interrupted, when a research submarine un-intentionally surfaces in their lair, destroying Mr. Freezes tranquility, and endangering Mr. Freeze's cryo-frozen wife by destroying her freezing chamber. As a result, Mr. Freeze retruns to Gotham City to get the materials to save his wife, and crime and mayhem ensues. I really like the insight into the character of Mr. Freeze you get with this movie, and who better to do it than the people/series which redefined this character. The Mr. Freeze we know today was created by Batman TAS, even though the character was originally conceived in the 1960s. In my opinion this movie is the weaker of the two, but still a pretty decent watch.

My only complaint with this set is the lack of special features, this set is pretty bare bones when it comes to this department.

I recommend this for any Batman/ Batman TAS fan. It amazes me that after 15 or so years, these stories seem as fresh as they were when they came out. For anyone who wants to tap into or try out Batman TAS, this set is a good place to start, and will open the door to a great part of the Batman universe.",1351641600,,3142,4.516695957820738
1249499,5,B000022TS5,"Batman & Mr. Freeze: Subzero is a great animated movie. This is the second Batman animated movie based off of Batman: The Animated Series, and the second animated movie in the DCAU. This movie features Victor Fries aka Mr. Freeze as the main villain, who kidnaps Barbara Gordon aka Batgirl, who plans on having her donate one of her vital organs to save the life of his wife Nora Fries. I would say Mr. Freeze would be one of my favorite Batman villains, as he is more of a tragic villain than a murderous villain. After all, he can't survive out of Subzero temperatures and his wife is very ill. This movie includes great special features, such as:
The Hunt for MR FREEZE Game
Get The Picture: How to Draw Batman
Music Montage
Cast and Crew Information
Trailers
Also, this is the last time the original Batman animation is used, as this movie takes place before The New Batman Adventures (Batman: The Animated Series Volume 4). So if you don't already have this movie, I highly recommend you get it.",1351468800,,1000,4.561111111111111

1249502,5,B000022TS5,"I used to have these films on videocassette back in the day, I don't know why it took me so long to get them on DVD.  I know I probably paid a lot more for each videocassette than I did for this DVD.

Mask of the Phantasm was WB's attempt to cash in on their wildly successful animated series that ran from 1992 to 1995 (then it changed names and networks and ran for a couple more seasons.)  Originally, it was going to be a DTV (Direct to Video) movie but then WB made the not-so-wise decision to release it in the theaters and only gave the filmmakers 8 months to get it ready for the big screen, which caused the film to bomb.  However, it has become a ""cult classic"" by becoming popular among its original intended audience:  home video viewers.  It's a dark tale of revenge that has a few plot twists along the way and keeps new viewers guessing as to who the Phantasm is until the end (unless they figure it out.)  It also flashes back to when Bruce was first starting out as the caped crusader and offers some nice glimpses into his early days as Batman.  The animation is a fantastic blend of CGI and hand drawings and the story is great.  However, I know I wouldn't have wanted to see a 1:33:1 aspect ratio film in the theater, so I can kind of see why it bombed.  But, it looks great on TV, even on my 32-inch LCD 720p HDTV.

SubZero is a DTV movie they did 5 years after Mask of the Phantasm.  The story is more straight forward, no real plot twists.  Mr. Freeze's wife is dying (as she was on the TV series) and she requires a transplant.  Of course, she has a rare blood type, the same type that Barbara Gordon has.  So, with the aid of a shady former colleague, Mr. Freeze kidnaps Barbara in an attempt to save his wife's life and it's up to Batman and Robin to save her.  Like Mask of the Phantasm, SubZero has great animation and a great story.  Both films also feature really nice soundtracks.

Personally, I think this DVD is great.  Two movies for one low price.  Plus, it's a flip disc, which comes in handy.  After watching Mask of the Phantasm, I just flipped the disc to watch SubZero.  As others have noted, the packaging and disc are a little odd.  SubZero is shown first on the box art and is on side A of the disc, even though Mask of the Phantasm is the earlier film.  Since I remember these films well and know in which order they go, this wasn't a problem for me, but I can see where it would be confusing for people who aren't familiar with the movies.  The only reason I can think of that they did this is because SubZero is considered a success, while Mask of the Phantasm isn't (due to WB's decision to release a movie that should have gone DTV in the theaters.)",1347062400,3,2697,4.200389105058366

1249507,5,B000022TS5,"Dr. Victor Fries (aka Mr. Freeze) has been living in Alaska for the past months in trying to find a way to be in peace with himself and trying to find the cure for his preserved sick wife. When intruders destroy her containment capsule, she is dying as he heads back to Gotham to find a doctor named Belson who is the only key in helping her find a cure. They discover that the only cure is by an organ transplant as they kidnap Barbara Gordon (aka Batgirl) who is the only hope to save her yet she refuses, Batman (voiced by Kevin Conroy) and Robin (voiced by Loren Lester) must try to save her.

A unique follow-up to the brilliant ""Mask of the Phantasm"" as it was originally slated to be released in 1997 to tie-in with Joel Schumacher's film ""Batman and Robin"" but decided to hold up for next year because of the poor reception that movie got. However when it was released on video it earned positive reviews from critics and Batman fans alike who got rid of the bitter aftertaste of the terrible ""Batman and Robin"" as this was the film that the film ""Batman and Robin"" should have been. What makes this great besides it's stylish animation and atmosphere is the brilliant mature script writing and emotion this movie puts you through as it shows that Mr. Freeze is a tragic figure like in the brilliant TAS episode ""Heart of Ice"", this one has great character development and action abound as it's one of Batman's best adventures.

1249511,5,B000022TS5,"This is the only movie on IMDB that is higher than the Dark Knight, and while I'm not sure that I agree, I don't exactly disagree either.  I love the Dark Knight and what Christopher Nolan has done in creating the Batman Universe into the real world with a lot of psychology and modern day references to terrorists and polotics, and its an amazing piece of work, but what it fails to do is to take into account all the childhood batman myths that comic fans have loved for generations, and the fox animated series did.  It was what Tim Burton wanted to do in the movies, and all the big enemies were treated without kid gloves, and given full backstories, and the art direction is just amazing.  I am not really a comic book fan, and I probably wouldn't know about so many of these characters had that series not existed.  Mak of the Phantasm is the best movie to come from that show, and is included in this set, and is the cheapest way to obtain it, and they throw in another pretty good movie along with it.  Sub Zero is about average fair for what the tv show was, having Mr. Freeze trying to bring his frozen wife back to life, and they found that Bat girl has matching DNA that would allow this to happen, and MR. Freeze has paid off the hospital to see that this happens.  The show spends plenty of time making the Mr. Freeze character sympathetic, but I think with the amount of time he was on the show, this whole movie just seems plaid out and better left for a show miniseries.  Mask is almost just as good at asking all the moral questions about justice and vigilante means in a corrupt society, and the psychology of law enforcement as almost any movie ever made, and like Dark Knight, it takes all of the complex ideas and manages to be able to explain them all to the smallest child.  I think that kind of story telling should definately be rewarded, but while as a stand alone it might not be as strong as the live action movie in question, where is succeeds is that it takes the character of Batman that you see over five seasons on the show and builds on him and his relationshps.  Plenty of unexpected twists and turns, and definately the best animated Batman project ever, though I stronly encourage batman fans to get the fox animated series, you don't ""need"" to have seen it to appreciate this awsome set.",1307232000,3,2327,4.355658198614319

1249513,5,B000022TS5,"Batman:  Mask of the Phantasm is one of the best Batman movies ever (including the live-action). It tracks the mythos of Batman's very early days of crime-fighting. You'll enjoy his mishaps and blunders. At the same time, it tracks his older days (perhaps mid-30's) where he's such a well-oiled machine of a superhero that he almost gives you the creeps.

The plot revolves around romantic relationships and murder. I would not recommend this movie for children under 13.

Batman: Subzero is fairly standard Batman fair. It's not a bad movie at all, but it's a dim cousin to the Mask of the Phantasm. The animators tried to insert 3d computer graphics into the movie, which lost a lot of its luster. But the story is very human and you'll have a difficult time not feeling sympathetic for the villain -- which is the best kind.

Both movies are quite good. If you've never seen them and you like Batman, then you are completely in the dark. Buy them right now!

If you've seen them before or you own one or the other, you might do better to pick up a different collection. In my opinion, Sub-Zero just wasn't worth owning as much as Mask of the Phantasm.",1301270400,8,1154,4.555555555555555

A villain that isn't truly evil, only doing what he does for a tragic reason, it isn't the kind of stuff that happens much in kids cartoons.

I enjoyed the film. It had a cool art direction, I like Mr. Freeze as a villain, his use of polar bears as minions was very smart, and the ending is very tense, a true nailbiter. It just felt like a professional Batman film. Still, I think I would have liked it more if Robin hadn't been almost completely useless in this film, and Mr. Freeze wasn't as threatning as he could have been. Still, this film is definately not bad, or even sub-par.",1290124800,,725,4.291970802919708

1249516,4,B000022TS5,"Made at about the same time as Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, and the live-action Batman & Robin film, ""Sub-Zero"" explores the somewhat sympathetic villain, Mr. Freeze.  Freeze has his wife in cryogenic suspension in a tube that he's kept for many years in an arctic cave.

Unfortunately a sub decides to use that same cave to crash through in order to get some kind of expedition going (we never find out the why or how of that, but that's not a vital plot point).  Sadly the sub knocks down the tube and his wife Nora lies out in the open.  Freeze and his bears are not happy.  He kills the sub crew with his freeze gun in revenge.

Fast-forward to Gotham, where Freeze reinstates  himself with an Eskimo boy and the help of a financially shot doctor who tells Freeze they need a live organ donor to save Nora's life.

Sadly, Batgirl, aka Barbara Gordon, has the rare blood type.  She is soon kidnapped (which we get to see a high speed chase by Dick Grayson!) and made prisoner on an oil derrick.

Interesting themes -- regardless of the title, it's really a Robin & Batgirl story.  Batgirl plays the majority of the film as the athletic Babs Gordon who despite her small size kicks some pretty serious butt.

The action really starts flying on the oil derrick.  The animation here, with the lights, the dark and the cool flying Batplane are a sight to behold.  Shivers!

Chooosing to save someone's life despite what they've done or how ""bad"" they are is one theme.  Another, forgiveness and gratitude.  And still another, revenge for things done to themselves, real or imagined.  Well thoughout story, plenty of action and does not insult the intelligence.

A must-see!

All in all, a great voice-over cast!

1249517,4,B000022TS5,"Also called Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero, this was the second full-length animated movie of the Darknight Detective, although, this was the first one to be specifically made-for-video. It was meant to draw attention to the Batman franchise enough to coincide with the appauling Batman & Robin live-action movie, although most people were suprised at how much better this film was from that one.

The story takes place after Season 3 of Batman: The Animated Series, but sometime prior to when Dick Grayson left to become Nightwing. Mr. Freeze has been hanging out in the North Pole with his trained polar bears, and his wife Nora has been ""chilling"" inside the same oversized snowglobe until Freeze can find a cure for her. Unfortunately, an arctic exploration crew crashes his pad, causing Nora to relapse into her disease. Making his way to Gotham, Freeze abducts Belson, an old medical colleague who is desperate to make some quick money to pay off some debts. Freeze offers him a gold deposit to help him save Nora. They look for an compatible donor to replace one of Nora's organs that was damaged(which one is never said), and their search leads them to Barbara Gordon. After kicking some ass as Batgirl, Barbara goes out with Dick on what looks like the beginning of their romance. Freeze breaks up their date, and kidnaps Barbara. Dick and Bruce head to the Batpoles and locate where Barbara is being held, which is at an offshore oil rig. Barbara manages to get away, but Belson accidently starts a fire. Nora gets trapped underneath in the fire, so Mr. Freeze helps Batman and Robin get her out of the burning wreck, although Freeze seemingly doesn't make it out. Although the movie concludes with Freeze back in the Arctic conveniently making it to an outpost station to see the CNN report that Nora recovered thanks to Bruce Wayne's big wallet.

Of the three original Batman: TAS animated movies, this one probably has the weaker plot to it. I don't mind them bringing back Mr. Freeze, although you would've had to see the prior episodes of the series to get his backstory which is pretty essential for watching this movie. There also is an absence of the Batman Family doing much any real ""crime-fighting"" in this, aside from a scene at the beginning where the Dynamic Duo make a real thing about stopping a couple of crooks when they could've taken them out easily. It's also a little disappointing when we catch up with Freeze again in Season 4 of the TV series where he returns again as an emo psychopath because he's then just a head on a robot spider-legs(BTW, Freeze's suit was originally designed by Mike Mignola of Hellboy fame). I'd say that your average Bat-Fan would like this, but only if they had the TV series boxset to go with it.",1280016000,,2757,4.717842323651452
1249528,3,B000022TS5,"Subzero is classic Batman: The Animated Series. Any fans of the beloved 90's TV series will find some nostalgia here.  There's the classic detective work, an impressive motorcycle chase, great voice acting, it's all here.  But with that said, Subzero doesn't go the distance.  For reasons I don't understand, it doesn't spend any time covering Freeze's back-story (which is odd, because TAS are the ones who created it).  Without this explanation, Freeze comes off as a real toolbag rather than someone making evil choices out of desperation.  However, the film finishes his character arc extremely well.  The last 2 minutes are the best part of the film.  But unless you've seen TAS episode revealing his origin, you miss the full picture.  Because of this, Subzero feels like a lengthy episode instead of a movie.  It's good, it's classic, but it doesn't put in the extra effort.",1278720000,,881,4.97945205479452

This movie is great.  It explores the character of Mr. Freeze, and if you'll recall his episode ""Heart of Ice"" won the show an Emmy.
The character relationships are very well fleshed out.  And the story and action won't let you down.
The only downside to this movie is the odd use of CGI.  Obviously, the creators of this film were hoping for something groundbreaking, but the CGI and traditional animation don't mesh well together so it's a little distracting at times.

As a plus, the movie stands alone and is great as it is.
But for fans of the series, there are little nuances to the characters that are made all the more enjoyable by having watched the show.

But hey, it's now the past, and I've got ""Subzero"" to enjoy.

This is a great animated film, as great as ""Mask of the Phantasm"". The mix of traditional 2D animation and 3D animation seems out of balance at times, but the plot is so gripping, that I didn't even notice the contrast. The voice acting is superb (Michael Ansara as Freeze in particular), and the music is very Elfman-like (main titles is pretty much Elfman, though). Action sequences are a plus, and the car chase in the middle of the film is exciting.

Mask of the Phantasm is just one of the best comic book cartoon movies ever.  One thing that I always liked about the 90's DC Animated Universe is that it really wasn't just for kids.

1249548,4,B000022TS5,"In this direct-to-DVD release, Batman and Robin face off against Mr. Freeze as he kidnaps Barbara Gordon for use in an experiment meant to reanimate his deceased wife. Out of all the animated films I have, this one-I'm not too crazy about. Don't get me wrong, the animation is just fine and the story itself is servicable(although a bit simplistic) but it's just not too compelling to me. Course, Mr. Freeze(except for his appearances on ""The Batman"") hasn't always been a very intriguing adversary for Batman to go up against, anyways. Because of that, he has never really been a big favorite of mine out of all of Batman's villains. At least, we get some cool extras on the DVD.  For extras, WB provided a cast and crew listing and a variety of theatrical trailers for other Batman products along with the teaser trailer for Scooby Doo. We're also given ""The Art of Batman"" that features production artwork interspersed with action from the film. An artist briefly demonstrates how to draw Batman in the ""Get the Picture"" feature(click the slow-mo if you want to learn how to draw him), and finally there's ""The Hunt for Mr. Freeze"" game.

1249550,5,B000022TS5,"Many reviews of Sub Zero compare it unfavorably to Mask of the Phantasm. The criticisms center on two things, the prominence of Barbara Gordon and the melding of traditional and computerized animation. Regarding the former, the movie is slow at the midpoint with its focus on Barbara and while Batman's absence is noticeable, he has starred in other cartoons so his reduced role is not as troublesome. Concerning the latter, the different animation styles appear awkward at first sight but are less apparent after repeated viewings. The Batwing looks awesome. The story again focuses on the relationship between Victor Fries and his wife Nora, with Babs thrust into things as a possible savior for Nora. Unfortunately she may not be around to take bows. The movie climaxes atop an oil derrick during an action packed finale reminiscent of a James Bond flick. The romantics among us will enjoy the closing minutes especially. So forget the comparisons, for despite a few flaws Sub Zero stands on its own as another strong entry in Batman animated features.",1210636800,,1055,5.034285714285715

1249552,4,B000022TS5,"When I was growing up back in 1992 I was a big fan of Batman: The Animated Series and I still am. So needless to say when I saw Batman: Mask of the Phantasm in theaters I loved it and I thought it was better than Tim Burton's rendition of Batman.

When I saw Subzero for the first time I thought it paled in comparison to Mask of the Phantasm but I thought it was still enjoyable because it was kind of a companion piece to Batman & Robin...and Subzero was actually better than Batman & Robin.

I think bundling Mask of the Phantasm and Subzero together is great a idea but I just wish the WB had done this sooner. I'm not upset about the WB leaving Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman out of the bundle because quite frankly I never liked Mystery of the Batwoman in the first place.",1205020800,5,779,4.152317880794702
1249553,4,B000022TS5,"While initially thought to be a two-disc release of the previous releases for the films, Warner Home Video has pressed a whole new flipper disc for this DVD release, putting SubZero on one side and Mask of the Phantasm on the other (featuring the films fullscreen transfer). Also confusing is the DVDs packaging that puts SubZero before Mask of the Phantasm in nearly every respect.

The two sides of the discs are complete duplicates of the original releases and contain nothing new. Exact same menus and exact same video transfers. They could've taken the time to hunt down that 5.1 surround track for SubZero that was released on LaserDisc and tossed it on here, but that's not what this release was meant for. A quick cash in on the ever growing popularity of one of comic books most famous heroes. Here's hoping we'll see a more worthy release for Mask of the Phantasm come it's twentieth anniversary.

For those that don't already own these two films, it's a cheap alternative to buying two different DVD releases, but for those that already have these two releases it's a definite downgrade. Not only do you have to still deal with a flipper disc, you lose the widescreen transfer of Mask of the Phantasm. Not a huge loss considering the film was animated in fullscreen, but still. This is really just a cash cow release that, one can hope, was just released to check the interest in these two films to see if future special editions are warranted. Let's all hope for a Phantasm special edition to coincide with The Dark Knight DVD release, shall we?

1249567,5,B000022TS5,"I truly enjoyed this particular Batman episode. It was action-packed.  The animation and graphics were just fantastic!

Mr. Freeze, a.k.a Victor Fries, is somewhere in the Artic, along with his wife, Nora, who is in a cyrogenic (sp?) state.  Nora is suffering from some heart disease.  Mr. Freeze, who truly loves his wife, has put her in a capsule to slow down the disease until a cure has been found.

However, when something happens that threatened the health of Nora, Mr. Freeze must act fast to save her life.  Mr. Freeze stalks Gotham City, along with his 2 polar bears.  He kidnaps a doctor, a former colleague of Mr. Freeze.  With the doctor's help, they were able to pinpoint who shares the same rare blood type as Nora's...and that is Barbara Gordon, a.k.a. Batgirl.

Dick Grayson (Robin) and Barbara are out on a date at a swing dance club.  Mr. Freeze attacks the place and kidnaps Barbara.  Dick tries to save Barbara but ultimately fails.

Batman and Robin investigate immediately.  Their investigation led them to discover why Mr. Freeze is in town and why Barbara has been kidnapped.  The problem is where is Barbara hidden.  Time is essential.

At first, you'll look at Mr. Freeze as this vicious villian.  However, after reflecting, you'll see that he shares the same frustration like the rest of us on the medical system.  His wife is slowly dying.  She can be saved with some medical treatment.  However, the waiting list is long.  The cure has yet to be discovered, despite the donations of millions of dollars.  In the end, Mr. Freeze was simply a desperate man who wanted to save his wife.

My favorite part was the end, where everyone is helping each other despite what damages have been done.  However, was it enough to save Nora?  That's for you to watch and find out.

*SubZero* is one of the best animated shows that I've seen.",1171238400,5,1855,4.683229813664596
1249568,4,B000022TS5,"Mr. Freeze is up to his old tricks again. For the last time, he's going to try and save the life of his comatose wife through criminal means.

Victor Fries, now turned into the tragically cold Mr. Freeze, enlists the help of a villainous master surgeon to conduct an organ transplant on his wife Nora. When there are no available organs, Freeze commands him to GET one. And the one person in Gotham who matches Nora's blood type is Barbara Gordon, secretly Batgirl.

The early minutes of the film present us with a posh shindig, to which Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson are invited. They show up looking dapper in their tuxedoes, both with one thing on their minds but in different ways. Bruce is womanizing the beautiful female guests and Dick is eagerly awaiting the arrival of the object of his affections: Barbara.

Dick and Barbara begin what one can only call a budding romance, which stays canon with comic book lore. While the two always flirted and hinted at becoming involved during their adolescence, they never really started dating until reaching their early 20's.

Sometime later while Dick and Barbara are on a date at a swing dance club, Mr. Freeze has tracked her down, bringing along two fierce polar bears as ""henchmen."" They tear up the place and Dick does a pretty good job trying to protect Barbara, but I know he's better than the display he put on. He's Robin for crying out loud and I expected more of a fight. ""Pretty good"" just isn't good enough for Batman's second as far as I'm concerned. So, to make a long story short, after a tricky car/motorcycle chase through the outskirts of Gotham Hills, Freeze gets away with his hostage.

Of course, Batman and Robin eventually sniff out their whereabouts through sheer detective work, which is nice to see from time to time. Just as Barbara is on the verge of escape, she hits a wall and the Dynamic Duo have to officially bail her out of trouble. The last sequence is absolutely beautiful. Everyone is trapped on an oil refinery in the middle of the Atlantic and, through negligence and dramatic influence on part of the writers, it's going to explode soon. Fighting fires, polar bears, Mr. Freeze and a trigger-happy doctor, Batman, Robin and Barbara Gordon manage to save themselves, the day, and a few lives in one spectacular finish with a happy ending.

The artwork is sometimes good, sometimes wonderful. I had the feeling that there was a different artist in the first half than in the second - with the second half being better by leaps and bounds. It was almost as if there's a seperate person handling the animation when Dick and Bruce are in costume. Either way, no real complaints here. The story was dead on and the voice-work presented the usual kick-butt results that we've come to expect from the Batman cartoons.",1171065600,2,2800,4.680894308943089

It has a gothic dark gritty look like Batman, Batman Returns, and the all famous Batman Mask of the Phantasm. It also has a good story, nice action and touch ups on the animation,  a very good dialog & atmospere. So if you have Batman and Robin, and don't really like it much get rid of it and replace it with a real Batman film called Batman and Mr. Freeze Sub Zero.",1169251200,,664,4.312
1249570,4,B000022TS5,"This movie is the second animated feature from the Batman series.

Enter both Batman and Robin(who was either still with the circus or at college in Mask of the Phantasm), step up to stop Freeze.

As far as the animated Batman movies go, I've never truly disappointed, I'm just not a big Mr. Freeze fan. My personal favorite villian is the Joker, but I don't even really consider Freeze a villian up until the Gotham Knights series. He's just an incredibly intelligent man pushed by his world into his current position. However, if you want good animation, and really good story, and Excellent voice acting, then this is your movie.

If you haven't even heard of the animated series, I'd recommend a few episodes first, or Mask of the Phantasm.

1249571,3,B000022TS5,"You might be surprised to see that there is virtually no character development in SubZero, which is in stark contrast to Mask of the Phantasm. If you aren't caught up on the animated TV series, you'll have a hard time appreciating this movie. SubZero focuses too much on action. That's fine for episodes of the animated series, but it's not good when a movie is all action and no heart. This movie feels rushed, like no one put enough effort into making a good movie. It's like they hastily made a three-part story for the TV series, threw in some ""fancy"" computer animation, then suddenly decided to call it a movie. SubZero would've been a great three-part storyline for the TV series if they'd lose the stupid computer animation. Put simply, SubZero just doesn't work as an animated movie.

Robin/Dick Grayson and Batgirl/Barbara Gordon are in the movie just as often as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Robin is a good sidekick for Batman in the animated TV series, and he's also a good addition to this movie. I'm just glad that Robin wasn't annoying, because I still have bad memories of Robin in Joel Schumacher's Batman movies. Unfortunately, Batman has to share his screentime with Batgirl and Robin. Compared to the screentime Batman gets in Mask of the Phantasm, I was disappointed that Batman wasn't in SubZero more often. But then again, it was absolutely necessary for Robin and Batgirl to be central characters in this movie.

Mr. Freeze always was a sympathetic character in the TV series. In this movie, he's still trying to find a cure for his wife's disease. And if that wasn't enough, he's also adopted an orphaned Inuit boy. But the boy is annoying, and I would've preferred it if he wasn't in the movie. Shortly after the movie begins, a submarine breaks through the surface in the frozen Arctic Ocean. Mr. Freeze keeps Nora (his wife) in a cryogenic chamber inside an Arctic cave. Unfortunately, the sub has surfaced in the middle of Mr. Freeze's cave, and Nora's chamber has been smashed beyond repair. The chamber kept Nora's disease from becoming fatal. Now that her chamber is destroyed, she only has a few weeks to live. An infuriated Mr. Freeze uses his ice gun to freeze the entire crew of the submarine. Frankly, I find it a little hard to believe Mr. Freeze would be able to single-handedly take over the sub, herd the entire crew outside of the sub, and then freeze everyone. So I take this as further proof that the filmmakers rushed this movie, and didn't put enough thought into certain areas of the plot.

One incredibly annoying scene is when Commissioner Gordon is talking about Barbara. He doesn't know his daughter is Batgirl. So while Gordon is going on about how sweet and gentle Barbara is, the movie keeps cutting back to her beating up bad guys while in her Batgirl costume. You can tell the filmmakers just threw that scene into the movie for any viewers who aren't familiar with the TV series, so that everyone will be clear about Barbara's secret identity.

Apparently, Nora needs an organ transplant in order to survive. I don't believe they say which organ(s), but that doesn't matter. Barbara is a perfect match, so Freeze tracks her down. At a fancy party for rich people, which Dick and Barbara are attending, Mr. Freeze shows up, demanding that Barbara come with him. Dick tries to intervene, and gets smashed by a full-grown polar bear. One would think he'd at least have the wind knocked out of him, and take a while to recoup. But being smashed by such a huge bear barely fazes him. And did I mention that Freeze's goons are POLAR BEARS? The bears are annoying, and I really wish Mr. Freeze decided to use human goons instead.

The movie's computer animated sequences are at their worst when Dick is on the motorcycle. The computer animation is bland, and lifeless. To put it simply, I hate the computer animation. But my main complaint is that when you have the regular animation and the computer animation side by side, it looks awkward. If you ever saw Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings cartoon (which used regular animation and some other kind of live action animation) you'll have an idea of why it's a bad idea to use two very different kinds of animation in the same movie.

There's a few other things in SubZero that annoyed me. Instead of creating a theme for this movie, they just borrowed Danny Elfman's theme from Tim Burton's first Batman movie. Michael McCuiston does the background music in this movie. He's not bad, but he's no Shirley Walker. Another thing that annoyed me was that you can see claw marks in the pavement from the robber as Robin was reeling him in, right before throwing the robber in the trash. I could see Superman leaving marks in pavement like that, but not a common thug.

My favorite part of the movie is when it shows the Batwing leaving the Batcave. That part was done by computer animation, and I have to admit that it looks cool. But the computer animation looks horrible when it shows the Batwing flying low across the water toward the oil rig. These days I doubt you'd ever see an abandoned oil rig storing vast quantities of oil. But you just know that the whole thing will catch fire and explode at some point during the final showdown. And ONE CHARACTER DIES. But don't get excited about it. Once this particular character has served their purpose in the movie, the character is disposed of by the filmmakers. SubZero is a must-see for fans of the TV series, because a lot of important events happen in this movie. But if you're not familiar with the TV series, I'd advise you to stay away.",1155427200,3,5583,4.650455927051672
1249572,5,B000022TS5,"While no Batman animated film will ever top the 1993 masterpiece ""Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm"", this 1998 follow up is nearly as good as that should've been classic.

When Mr. Freeze returns to Gotham City, to find a donor for his dying wife Nora, who has kept chryogenically frozen at his now destroyed hideaway, he kidnaps Barbara Gordon aka Batgirl for a blood transfusion, despite knowing that he could easily kil her. Batman and Robin go on a desparate hunt to find their missing sidekick, but to no avail. As time runs out for Nora, Barbara and everyone else, the film gets stronger and leaves you with an ending you will never forget.

1249573,3,B000022TS5,"After the success of ""Batman:  The Animated Series"" and the spin-off movie ""Batman:  Mask of the Phantasm"", the powers that be at Warner Brothers decided to go back for an animated sequel with ""Batman & Mr. Freeze:  Sub Zero"".  This time, the WB opted not to release the film to theaters, but rather go directly to video and television.  Though this movie appeared to show a lack of faith on the part of Warner Brothers regarding this new animated Batman feature, this second animated film is still jam-packed with explosive action, gripping performances and drama that will keep you frozen in your seats until the very end.

""Batman & Mr. Freeze:  Sub Zero"" pits the Dark Knight against his coolest foe (pun intended), Mr. Freeze.  Desperate to find a cure for the disease that is killing his wife, Mr. Freeze seeks a blood donor that is compatible to his precious Nora.  His search leads him to none other than the daughter of Gotham City police commissioner James Gordon, Barbara Gordon (aka Batgirl).  To save Barbara it will take the combined strength of Batman (Kevin Conroy) and Robin before Barbara's fate is sealed in ice.

With the great response to ""Batman:  Mask of the Phantasm"" expectations were undoubtedly high for this animated sequel.  As I said earlier the move from theatrical release to direct-to-video did cause some concern, the movie still proved to be very strong, and continued the story of Mr. Freeze's desperate search for a cure from the animated series into this movie.  Another great aspect of moving Freeze's storyline into a feature film allowed the creators of the film and the series to go darker with the story, showing just how cruel Mr. Freeze could get when his desperation takes over.  Though technically a sequel in terms of being the second Batman animated film, this movie focuses more on Mr. Freeze and his motives than on anything Batman does.

In truth, as much as I enjoyed this movie, I do agree with Warner Brothers' decision not to release this movie theatrically, because I feel that the movies subject matter and pace would not have yielded great box office numbers.  With that being said, I still highly recommend this movie to any fans of Batman in any shape or form.  It is still a well-crafted film with great voice acting, action scenes, and storytelling.  This is definitely not a film to be missed by anyone that is a fan of ""Batman:  The Animated Series"".

1249588,4,B000022TS5,"BatMan/Mr. Freeze: Subzero had the unenviable task of following BatMan: Mask Of The Phantasm. Until the recent Batman: Mystery Of The BatWoman, I ranked this one the weakest of the Batman animated features.

I first saw it when it came out in the late 90's and now that I've seen it again, I can appreciate it for what it was and is. It'll never match MOTP but then again, it isn't supposed to. The only weak point visually is that it tries to merge the ""Dark Deco"" animation with computer graphics. In some instances, it works but in others it looks terrible!

As for the story, it follows the series very closely. In fact that is the one thing it DOES have over MOTP and that is it follows the series where as MOTP was more of a stand alone story that could've happened at any point (my guess is that ""Mask"" happened between Seasons 1 & 2).

In the series, Batman encounters Mr. Freeze twice. The second time (in an episode called ""Deep Freeze"" which is available on BatMan: The Animated Series, Volume 3), Mr. Freeze is reunited with his thought to be dead wife Nora! I won't tell that story as you'll have to get that set to see it or catch it on rerun on TV.

Anyway, we find Mr. Freeze with his still frozen wife Nora in the frozen North when an explorer group accidentally breaks up his home and puts his wife in jeopardy! Fueled by his desire to save her, he enlists an old friend of his (who has troubles of his own) to perform an illegal operation to save Nora's life. Unfortunately, this operation involves Barbara Gordon (Batgirl)!

Naturally, this brings Batman and Robin into the situation. While not as gripping as MOTP or even BatMan Beyond: Return Of The Joker, it is an exciting tale that has an ending that is both sad but joyous nonetheless. This one, in my opinion, is also safer for kids under 13 than MOTP or BB:ROTJ so while not totally a family film, I don't think there is anything in it that parents will get offended over. I should also note that this was the final Batman feature to use the style of animation that was used in the original 65 episodes of the TV series and in ""Mask Of The Phantasm.""

MINOR POINT: I do have a bit of a problem with the title. I would've named it BATMAN & ROBIN VS. MR. FREEZE: SUBZERO. As I said, minor point! Doesn't take away from the film.",1124409600,5,2304,4.334106728538283

The plot was fairly predictable and didn't involve much mystery, and the solutions to the problems the heroes faced seemed obvious.

1249595,4,B000022TS5,"Though that is somewhat of a wide opinion of reviewers on this web-site.  But it is true.  Joel Schulmacher was woefully misguided when he agreed to take up the directing reins from Tim Burton.  But the catoon show rose to the occasion, with the richly inspired ""Mask of the Phantasm,"" which delved deep into the noir and physclogical depths of the dark knight, without letting up on pacing or the films' central mystery.  ""Sub-Zero"" doesn't quite reach the heights of ""Phantasm,"" but it is more than a worthy successor to it.  One advancement on display in ""Zero"" is the fluid combination of computer and traditional animation.  The action set-pieces with Robin trying to chase down Mr. Freeze on a crowded highway and the climax abord an abandoned oil-rig are quite impressive.  However, experienced animated Batman director Boyd Kirkland never allows the animation and effects to impeed the fluid, air-tight plotting or the character interaction and development, which are things Kirkland and his team of animators, editors and voice-actors do consistently and satisfyingly well.
Plot: Batman, Robin and Batwoman, alwalys with their hands full, now have to contend with Mr. Freeze, who has found fresh determination in fighting the heroes and in searching for a cure for his very ill wife, whose condition is getting steadily worse.  She needs a transplant, but her blood-type is so rare that searching for a donar is proving near impossible.  And to complicate things, if a living person became a donar, that person would die.  But Mr. Freeze is hell-bent on saving his wife.  In the comics and various t.v., Mr. Freeze was always the most sympathetic anatagonist towards Batman and his cohorts.  In ""Sub-Zero,"" one cannot but feel sorry for him.  He has searched feverishly for his wifes' cure, became his sub-zero state in the process and now it may all be in vain.
It is the combination of smart plotting, swift-pacing and solid animation that make ""Sub-Zero"" memorable.  The cartoon show has outdone Joel Schulmacher and his disappointing attempts to make Batman come to the screen.  He is in need of what the cartoon and Tim Burton had I abundance:  Storytelling, character development and sensible villians.

1249610,4,B000022TS5,"In perhaps the single silliest marketing ploy of the last ten years, Warner released Subzero as part of their plan to promote the ludicrously popular live-action franchise in its latest installment, Batman and Robin.  That movie, of course, is to comic book movies what the Hindenberg was to blimp sales: less than a windfall, to put it mildly.  The animated film, however, retains the same earnest, serious, and smart demeanor that earned the television show its Emmys and works magnificently over the feature-length running time here.  Warner can't quite seem to believe that grown-ups are sick of the campy approach, so the DVD is, farcically, aimed at children, without storyboards, concept art, or a reasonable documentary.  That can't detract from the feature, however, which fleshes out the Mr. Freeze character (easily the best villain on the show) tenfold, giving voice actor Michael Ansara a real chance to shine, and even to upstage the excellent Kevin Conroy, who has been doing an exemplary Batman since the series launched.  This is a minor quibble, really, as Batman always plays second fiddle to the villains, even in the better comic books and the first two movies (can you remember a single Michael Keaton line from ""Batman?""  Neither can I.)  At any rate, if you have any affection for the Batman characters left after Arnold says, ""Everybody... chill,"" check this one out.  Warner knows kids are watching, so it's perfectly acceptable family viewing, and the dialogue, plot, and acting will engross most older viewers as well.",1058659200,,1546,5.107142857142857

1249613,2,B000022TS5,"Batman & Mr. Freeze: Subzero is a subpar release by WB. Especially disappointing is the decision to attempt to digitize parts of the animation. The 3d work is badly intergrated into the overall flow, and this leads to a very jarring effect.
The story also suffers from a lack of Batman, as most of the movie focuses on Batgirl and Mr. Freeze. Maybe this should have been reflected in the title.
All in all, this movie is passable, unless you're a completionist like myself.",1044576000,2,473,4.642857142857143

Mr Freeze is a sympathetic villain and he does set up some provoking situations for the characters but I still wanted more action and less talk if you know what I mean.
Don't get me wrong. It's a thousand-million times the movie that Batman & Robin was but...not wholesome or entertaining enough to get any special notice. The animation is fine and the brief return of Danny Elfman's Batman theme is appreciated though I struggle to find any real reason to suggest this 'un. Only for Batman completists.

Sticking to the dark look of ""Mask of the Phantasm"" and the animated series, ""Subzero"" is about Mr. Freeze's final attempt to save his wife, Nora. It is better in every way than the horrid ""Batman and Robin,"" and is even better than ""Batman Returns."" But it's the predecessor, ""Phantasm,"" that has the true grit in the Batman legacy.",1032134400,,450,5.013333333333334
1249616,4,B000022TS5,"In my humble corner of the universe, the creator/producer behind the BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES has masterminded the only storytelling -- big and small screen -- to hit the ""nail on the head"" with its portrayal of Batman, Robin, and the whole Rogues Gallery of criminals.  The animation is brisk, the tales are even swifter, and the conclusions typically pack an emotional wallop not commonly associated with animation.
SUBZERO isn't 'substandard' Bat-telling fare by any stretch of the imagination.  The tale -- Mr. Freeze once again is up to trying to save the life of his beloved wife, Nora, in suspended animation, and it just so happens that Barbara Gordon (aka Batgirl) has the proper DNA to make it possible -- is intelligent, insightful, and captivating.  The events happen quickly, and the action-packed ending puts everything in the budget up on the screen.
In fact, if SUBZERO has any shortcomings, it might be that the intended blending of traditional animation with CGI isn't as seamless as the producers might've wanted it to be.  There are whole sequences that stand out because of the contrast, but, in the end, they do little to detract from the story.
SUBZERO briefly explores the tragic nature of Mr. Freeze, a reluctant supervillain forced to do what he does out of the attempts to save his wife's life.  This is the beauty of the animated Batman venues; the characters -- especially the villains -- are just as flawed as Bats himself.",1021852800,12,1456,4.902439024390244
1249617,4,B000022TS5,"Honestly, I have to admit that I've always had a soft spot for the Dick Grayson/Barbara Gordon pairing.  From the early (and vaguely suspicious) hints in the 1960's to today's recent, complicated, and almost tragic full-on relationship, these two have always been able to make me melt.  While that may make me a horrible romantic and a total sap, please bear with me.
From almost day one, I was a huge fan of <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i>.  As a twelve-year old with very little to do after school, the wonderful animation and well thought-out storylines were a shining beacon amid a sea of twaddle.  B:TAS did animation and stories, and they did them well.  With episodes like ""Tyger, Tyger"", which not only provided a cautionary tale against the dangers of eugenic research BUT ALSO exposed legions of children to the poetry of Robert Blake, ""The Cat and the Claw"" parts 1 and 2, and ""Perchance to Dream"", the rich and textured emotional history of the Batman Legend was laid out for a new generation.
It was, in fact, this series that got me interested in the comics industry and, ultimately, led me into the DC universe permanently.  I was a major fan, and when ""Mask of the Phantasm"" came out, I was one of the first in line at the box office.
I was even happier when, in ""Shadow of the Bat"", Batgirl was introduced as a character and dramatic foil for both Batman and Robin.  She provided a spirit of energy and enthusiasm that, while present with Robin and Batman, was new and untried.  Plus, it added emotional depth and weight to Comissionor Gordon's precarious position of a Batman supporter.
Unfortunately, when the series wrapped up and morphed into ""The Batman And Superman Adventures"" and moved over to an affiliate running the WB, I lost track of it.  I tried, of course, to keep tabs on the video releases, but didn't really find out about ""SubZero"" until 2000.  When I found out about its release, I was over the moon and quickly tracked down a copy.  I was not dissapointed.
While, admittedly, the quality of the animation and plot were not on the level of ""Mask of the Phantasm"", I was not dissapointed.  ""Mask of the Phantasm"" was specifically a theatrical release while ""SubZero"" was always intended as a straight-to-video movie.  However, it was not, by any stretch of the imagination, sub par to the actual series.
The elements were there.  Victor Fries' desperation to save his wife.  Batman's determination to see justice done.  Batgirl's enthusiasm.  Robin's detective skills.  There are even hints of the beginnign cracks in Bruce and Dick's relationship that flower during the B/S Adventures.
Plus, Dick and Babs make out.
Overall, this is a really good movie that is enjoyable and contributes to the Batman Animated Series lexicon.  I recommend it highly.",1019952000,,2789,4.809224318658281

1249631,4,B000022TS5,"That's right, Warner Bros has decided to release Sub-Zero to DVD, along with JLA, ROTJ Uncut, and the first five Batman episodes. Sub-Zero was originally a direct-to-video release around late 1997 that was supposed to cash in on the popularity of the Batman and Robin movie, and bridge the gap between seasons of the tv series. HOWEVER, in a rather hilarious twist, the live-action movie bombed, and WB shelved Sub-Zero for a few months so it wouldn't make the movie look worse than it already did.
Sub-Zero features Mr. Freeze, one of the best villains from the now-classic Batman cartoons of the early 90's. What made this villain so memorable was the emotionless, monotone voice delivered by Michael Ansara. The villian also has some sentimental value for me, as his was the first episode of Batman I ever saw. The story revolved around Mr. Freeze taking revenge against those who killed his wife and destroyed his life, and was the most emotionally compelling piece of animation I'd seen up to that point.
Sub-Zero doesn't quite match that first Mr. Freeze episode I saw, due to some minor points and the fact that I was older, but its still an excellent piece of work. It's better than the last two live-action Batmans, but falls short of Mask of the Phantasm and Return of the Joker. As a recap, Mr. Freeze eventually finds out his wife Nora is still alive, kept in suspended animation. He retreats to the north pole, where he befriends a boy and some polar bears, and spends his time searching for a cure to his wife's disease. A team of explorers accidentally shatters Nora's containment vessel, and Freeze returns to Gotham to find a live organ donor to save his wife. That donor turns out to Barbara Gordon (Batgirl), which puts Batman and Robin on a race against time to find and save her.
The vocal talent is excellent, especially Michael Ansara and Kevin Conroy, who still continues to provide the voice of Batman to this day. The animation is really good for a direct-to-video release (hey, when ALL your animated movies are DTV, you tend to do a good job) and includes a lot of CGI enhancements. Some people have had problems with this, citing that the random CGI inserts detract from the movie. For me, it's no big deal, the CGI in this movie, especially of the submarine rising into the caverns in the intro, is impressive.
Where the movie falls short is in that Batman feels underutilized. Granted, Batman still has a beefier role than Clooney did in the live-action movie, but Robin and Batgirl tend to eat up more screentime. Nothing wrong with this, but the movie's full title was Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub-Zero, so I expected Batman. I also thought that Barbara's various escape attempts ate up more time than they should have. Finally, the movie doesn't really escape its DTV roots. Where Batman: Mask of the Phantasm was originally a theatrical release and Return of the Joker (Uncut) could have been one, Sub-Zero feels like three episodes of the TV series, albeit three VERY GOOD episodes.
Still, Sub-Zero is classic Batman. The new DVD makes for a great addition to your collection, or a great gift for a Batman fan. I've heard the supplements aren't anything overly special, just an intro by Bruce Timm and a game or two, but the disc should be relatively cheap and well worth it.

1249633,3,B000022TS5,"Perhaps if I had not seen the Batman episode ""Heart of Ice,"" I could have given this movie a better rating. Right along with Batman episodes like, ""Be A Clown,"" and ""If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?,"" ""Heart of Ice"" was one of the best episodes. Our first exposure to Mr. Freeze is cold and ambiguous. At first we can only see him as dark and cold; later, Batman watches a video that exposes not only Mr. Freeze's motives, but why he can no longer exist outside of a sub zero environment. (Excellent reversal from fear to sympathy!) But even though Batman feels sorry for him, he has to stop the revenge of Mr. Freeze from hurting innocent people. I STILL cry when I see the end of this episode. The lengthened movie of this episode is a fairly good story; the character development does not take a back seat to effects; and for the most part it holds your interest. But, I can not say this movie was NEARLY as good as the animated episode. (1). Why is Mr. Freeze and his wife in the middle of nowhere to begin with? (2.) The movie DOES NOT have the surprising impact and sudden reversal from fear to sympathy that the episode did. (3.) When Mr. Freeze goes after a live person, he loses too much sympathy too fast. For 90 % of the movie we see him as a sadist rather than a 3D character. I am not saying this is a bad movie, but if you have already seen the episode ""Heart of Ice,"" you may very well be disappointed.",992476800,,1425,4.2234432234432235

1249635,4,B000022TS5,"I've always liked the original ""Batman, The Animated Series,"" but I was disappointed by the first full length movie, ""Mask of the Phantasm"" as the Bruce Wayne love interest sub plot dragged on too long.  However, ""SubZero"" more than makes up for any lack of action.  This is a great Batman story, far more superior to the very miserable live action ""Batman & Robin"" that came out in and around the same time.  In fact this direct to video feature would give any of the live action Batmans a run for their money.
The plot, quickly, is about Mr. Freeze's attempt to find a organ donor for his dying wife.  He finds one in the body of Barbara Gordon (Batgirl). He kidnaps her, and it's up to Batman & Robin to find her before the operation can take place.
Combining computer graphics with the colorful, 1940ish animation style of ""Batman, The Animated Series,"" this movie is a guilty adult pleasure.  The action is top notch, including an edge of the seat third act which takes place aboard a flaming abandoned oil rig.  Sub plots include Dick Grayson (Robin) and Barbara's budding romance, and a slimy doctor who helps Mr. Freeze in order to cover his impending stock losses.  Both are believeable, but what makes this a great movie is the action.  As I said, the third act is a nail biter, but there is also an excellent chase scene between Freeze and Grayson, and Barbara's first escape attempt from the oil rig is well thought out and leads to her helpless realization that she isn't going anywhere.
My only regret is that this isn't out on DVD and unfortunately I'm not sure it ever will be.  That's too bad as I know I'm not the only fan of ""Batman, The Animated Series"" and this, with the quality sound, visuals and storyline, seems like a prime choice.",980467200,3,1757,4.534810126582278
1249636,3,B000022TS5,"For me, one of the finest aspects of the Timm/Dini era of animated Batman has been the ability to present some of the old villains as tragic figures. None has been more tragic than Victor Fries/Mr. Freeze, whose attempts to find a cure for his wife have been callously thwarted by big corporations. The producers of the current Batman have carefully sustained Mr. Freeze's story, even to the point of continuing it into the BATMAN BEYOND continuity. For the most part, SUB ZERO allows us to see the vulnerable man as he has been made into a villain, and it preserves Batman's compassion as it wrestles with his obsession for justice. Why the Warner Bros. suits throw money behind projects like the live-action BATMAN & ROBIN when they can find much more worthy stories in their WB Kids! and DC Comics divisions is beyond many of us who follow the Batman mythos. Sure, in SUB ZERO the Dick Grayson/Barbara Gordon romance is forced, the Commissioner Gordon affection for his daughter is saccharine, and the subplot about the Inuit boy is unnecessary; still, this story offers interesting transition between the introduction of Mr. Freeze to the current Batman animated continuity and the later stages of Mr. Freeze discovered in the latter BATMAN & ROBIN ADVENTURES and BATMAN BEYOND.
Having said that, I must disagree with many of the Amazon.com reviewers of this piece regarding the animation, which varies in quality throughout the movie. No figure walks naturally in this movie, and eyes often look as if they have been pasted onto heads. The worst transgression, however, comes from the forced combination of the computer animation with the more traditional animation. Unfortunately, the computer animation preserves a type of plastic sheen about it, looking so different from the other animation that it distracts from the viewing experience. The seams show too much. As we have seen, computer-assisted animation can blend well with traditional animation. Notice, for example, how FUTURAMA incorporates both forms seamlessly. Look also at WB's own IRON GIANT to see how computers can help animators bring an idea to life. SUB ZERO deserves better animation work than it has gotten, and WB has missed another opportunity to present Batman with the artistic integrity the character deserves.",977702400,3,2293,5.101063829787234
1249637,5,B000022TS5,"In America it is a shame that animation is so often relegated to the ""children's"" category.  Other nations have a respect for the talents and the energy of the artisans whose sole task is to tell a good  story through animated means.  This video release is superb from beginning  credits to the final frame and deserves to be seen by a wider audience -  preferably the makers of the last two ""live action"" films.  Like  the animated series, the movie features exemplary voiceover work from  regulars Kevin Conroy and Loren Lester, as Batman and Robin, respectively, with  an outstanding performance from Michael Ansara as the strip's most  sympathetic ""villain,"" Mr. Freeze.  The story keeps the viewer  captivated until the final resolution, itself being quite satisfying.  This  movie, if aimed at children, is not condescinding to them; it is simplistic  enough for them to grasp, and ""adult"" enough to get the parents  involved.  Hats off its filmmkers who respect the intelligence of the  audience, especially in a time when so many movies are excuses for  over-the-top special effects, wooden acting,lame dialogue, and a poorly  developed plot.

7915312,5,B000022TS5,"I have been waiting for WB to remaster these classics for years and now they're finally here!  The first one they released was Mask of the Phantasm, probably the second greatest Batman feature film of all time (after Dark Knight, obviously) and now we have Sub Zero. The rest of the Animated Series is due later this year.

But about this one in particular, I have to admit that when I first saw it 20 years ago I wasn't impressed, possibly due to the terrible impression Batman and Robin had left upon the world, Schwarzenegger's performance in particular. And it honestly doesn't even come close to the greatness of Mask of the Phantasm, but that movie is truly special to me.

Maybe it's the fact that it looks so pretty now thanks to the remaster, and that it's been a long time since I first watched it, but I really enjoyed this movie. It feels like some of the better episodes of the Animated Series, like it could have been a great 3-parter on the show had they not gone the feature route.

Batman is always awesome but Robin, Batgirl, and Freeze are all written extremely well and have a lot to do in this movie. I highly recommend the blu ray version if you don't already own the dvd.
