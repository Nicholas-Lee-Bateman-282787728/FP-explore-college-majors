8292964,4,B001DDY6MQ,"ECHO BRIDGE and its predecessor, PLATINUM DISC flash an on-screen watermark every so often. With PLATINUM's previous ""Great American Western"" series (circa 2004) this logo appeared on some films for only a fraction of a second at a time.

Discs are single-side recorded. Biggest downside to this reasonably priced set is over-compression. Occasional artifacts may be noticeable, especially with rapid side-to-side movement. None of these pictures have undergone restoration, so dub quality depends solely on film stock condition. I find Echo Bridge's product a good bargain. Defective discs have been rare, audio is uniformly strong and visually (compared to other PD brands) they're a bit above average.

This edition includes several documentaries (doc.), also two feature-length movies created by combining four episodes of a 1971 TV series.
