4990315,4,B006HFXD6K,"Our 3 year old grandson loves Thomas and we enjoy getting DVD's for him because he watches them over and over again.  Now his little brother is enjoying them too.  It's a great investment for us.

The DVD's came quickly and in perfect shape.  The only downside is they are not the most up to date, but they still enjoy them.",1381795200,,324,4.262295081967213
4990316,5,B006HFXD6K,"Great Value - makes Mom's & Dad's happy & Any Thomas fan will love these DVD's.

Shipped quickly - arrived as scheduled.",1364428800,,120,4.454545454545454
4990317,5,B006HFXD6K,"Thanks for the DVDs. Shipping was fast and the discs were exactly as advertised.  Thinking about planning a trip with the wife to the island of Sodor now. Seems pleasant, even with all  the coal burning.",1361318400,,203,4.611111111111111
4990318,2,B006HFXD6K,"Movies were short and lack a proper Thomas plot...would not recommend.
We were very disappointed in the quality of the movies.",1361145600,,126,5.0476190476190474
4990319,4,B006HFXD6K,"The 3 movies in this pack is a great deal.  The only thing that I didn't like about it was that the movies are all in one, which would be fine if they all had their own seperate spaces.  All of the DVD's go on one ring, so they are all sitting on top of eachother spinning around.",1359504000,4,280,3.810344827586207
4990320,4,B006HFXD6K,"These are the same full length (60 minute or so) movies that you would buy seperately. All are appropriate for a 3.5 year old.  The only wish I had (and the reason it only got 4 stars) is that there is a full introduction to each episode. It would be better if they did like the Bob the builder DVDs and did a full intro at the start, and then a scaled down one between episodes.",1359504000,4,379,3.986842105263158
4990321,4,B006HFXD6K,"I didn't know where to start our Thomas collection so chose this.  In retrospect, the movie titles are not the perfect choice for our 17mo (too long) but we do enjoy putting them in for long trips. The movies themselves have good values, Great place to start our Thomas collection!",1357257600,,281,4.62
4990322,3,B006HFXD6K,"This is a great set of Thomas DVDs perfect for any Thomas & Friends fan. With three full DVDs for less than $20 you really can't go wrong! The DVDs features Thomas & Friends chugging along in fun adventures that mesmerized my boys. They are all wholesome and full of great lessons for kids.  I should add too that since these DVDs have already been released years ago, you should make sure you don't have them already if you are buying this set.",1330300800,,445,4.36144578313253

4990327,2,B006HFXD6K,Disappointed. Only one of three video's my son will watch. Hero of railway. The only 2 are old Thomas which I hate.  His mouth doesn't move. All people are plastic.

4990331,2,B006HFXD6K,Not quite what I expected. I was expecting it to be the same as the Thinas and Friends show on PBS but was not as cartoonish. Only watched part of one video so far. My son wasn't as interested in watching this video as show in PBS,1419984000,,230,3.9148936170212765

4990338,5,B006HFXD6K,"This was such a great price for 3 Thomas Movies. My first Hero of the Rails was so scratched we had to dump it. I bought this to replace ""Hero"", but got 2 extra movies on top. We Love Thomas!",1411516800,,191,3.8
4990339,4,B006HFXD6K,It's a bunch of Thomas movies. If you don't like Thomas don't get it and if you do it's perfect.,1410134400,,96,3.85
4990340,1,B006HFXD6K,"I bought this for my 2 year old son who loves Thomas. Two out of the three movies are horrible! Soooooo old school they look like they were filmed in the 1970's or something. They are literally just plastic toy trains being pushed around the scenes, the characters faces don't move other than their eyes going side to side, their mouths don't move when they talk. The only modern movie in the pack is Hero of the Rails, I wish I would have known so I would have just bought the one movie by itself because we aren't going to watch the other two in the pack.  Also, as another review mentioned the three discs are just stacked on top of each other in the case with no dividers between them.",1409961600,,689,4.259541984732825
4990341,4,B006HFXD6K,A wholesome show that I will let my child watch.  She loves the music.  Good value to get 3 movies for the price.,1409443200,,113,3.869565217391304
