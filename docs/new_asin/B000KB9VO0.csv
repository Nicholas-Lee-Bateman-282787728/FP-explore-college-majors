8155421,3,B000KB9VO0,"This DVD gives you a good perspective and good motivation about exercising no matter what your fit level or physical limitation (whether that limitation is permanent or temporary). This is slow, chair-based, easy workouts with an EXTREMELY MINUTE emphasis on diabetes.  Exercisers of all ages are shown (yay!). Adaptations for standing are covered. The music is not to our taste. If you're unfamiliar, take a look at the TV show, ""Sit and Be Fit"", before buying the DVD.",1335225600,5,470,5.0256410256410255
8155422,5,B000KB9VO0,This is a wonderful way to exercise even when you are seated in a chair.  A well done and encouraging workout.,1330732800,3,110,4.238095238095238
