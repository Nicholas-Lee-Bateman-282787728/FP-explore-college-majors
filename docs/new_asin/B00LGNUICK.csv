8665712,5,B00LGNUICK,"This is a wonderful upgrade of the 2002 TDK DVD that was released in Europe in a two-disc version. Kultur released a one-disc version in the United States that deserved  lots of reproaches. I was lucky get the European DVD and to enjoy the better resolution of the PAL format. However, a new HD version was needed because the new HDTVs revealed all the flaws of a film shot in standard definition.

The new Arthaus Blu Ray disc is a significant improvement compared with both  the Kultur and the TDK releases, even if the picture quality is not as good as in the new operas originally recorded in HD.  It also lacks the DTS and Dolby sound of the original TDK DVD, but the new Standard PCM sounds better than the original. I have also seen complaints about the Blu Ray disc in the French and British Amazon stores, but I don't see any reason to object the quality of the Arthaus release.

Theres not much to add about the quality of this memorable production after all what has been said before. Paul Agnew is superb in the title role (I have heard that he is now conducting a new production of this Opera) and Marc Minkowskis conduction is impressive. The other singers are also amazing, not only Mireille Delunsch as La Folie and Thalie, but also Yan Beuron as Thespis and Mercure, Doris Lamprecht as Junon and specially Valerie Gabail as L Amour and Clarine. I was particularly impressed by her rendition of Soleil Fuis Ces Lieux, better known as L Air de Clarine.

However, it seems that the only way to have a true HD video of this opera is by having a new performance with the same singers, the same conductor and the same production.",1434672000,5,1640,4.4865771812080535
8665713,5,B00LGNUICK,"We are finally able to see just how good the 2002 Chatelet recording by TDK actually is. This is an up-conversion of the original recording by TDK with improvements in both video and audio. This is an opera that invites you to relax and watch the joke unfold amidst all the absurdities, and backing off a bit from the extreme sharpness aids that. The sound is good clear PCM stereo; my receiver had no problem synthesizing a gentle surround effect that was very effective, and the lower end of the orchestra was well presented.
This offer is meant to be a romp - there maybe less material than usual, and a good portion of that is orchestral dances. Minkowski plays the hell out of it, with great energy. In a few places I preferred his reading from 1990 on CD but the visual aspect of this production is superb. While a full production done in Baroque costumes would be fascinating, it's hard to imagine it being nearly as much fun as this, or dancers in costume being able to keep up with the fleetness of the music or some of the acrobatics.
In preparing the new edition, it would have been nice to have the names of the gods agree, whether in Greek, Latin or French. The booklet lists them in French, the subtitles bounce between Greek and Latin. Since certain players play more than one part, it can get confusing. The players are all magnetic and excellent; Delunsch steals the show as La Folie and Agnew is perfect as Platee. It's disappointing to see that these wonderful players are not in more video productions.
Relax, enjoy and let Rameau's dances carry you away laughing.",1410480000,8,1584,4.56140350877193
