2383858,5,B000AAO0RY,"The other review on this page says that this is a great performance. I agree. Elton shines, but his percussionist, Ray Cooper, is the real star of this series of performances.

Since that's been said, I'll focus on technical issues.

Although I've had a tape of this tour for many years, until now I've been unable to locate a DVD version.

The DVD that I ordered was produced in Portugese, the official language of Brazil. Other than a cover in Portugese, the DVD appeared to be as good as any in terms of production quality. In fact, once you get it running, the picture quality is excellent (I ran it on an HDTV monitor).

Unfortunately, there are some technical problems, although these do do appear to be insurmountable. When I first loaded it, the Menu command on my remote would not allow me to move among options on the Menu screen. Fortunately, it defaults to the main feature and I got it running using the Forward button.

Before the final set, I paused it in order to eat dinner. About ten minutes later, there was the loud sound of static coming from the set, and the screen was filled with visual static. I was unable to get it to reset using the remote, and had to load another disk (Muriel's Wedding -- Urrrppp!), and then reload Elton after that. This time it worked fine, and I was able to access all of the features. The biographical material, unfortunately, is written in Portugese.

So would I buy it again? Yes, even with the limitations, but I would prefer to own the American version if it ever comes out.",1167177600,3,1529,4.501805054151625
2383859,5,B000AAO0RY,"I saw this concert at least 20 years ago. Not sure if it was on TV or if one of my friends had a VHS copy. A few songs are Elton alone with the Steinway then Ray Cooper the ""mad"" percussionist joins the stage. He reminds me of Tristan Farnon's mad conductor from ""All Creatures Great and Small"" but makes Tristan's excellent version seem almost tame. Ray is like some kind of demented English boys school headmaster. This was Russia when it was still the Soviet Union. The people were so polite to Elton and Ray - they could walk the streets without being mobbed. The film also includes beautiful footage of the Russian countryside, the Winter and Summer palaces. Some of the songs are so beautiful they brought tears to my eyes but when Elton and Ray pull out the stops, they ROCK THE HOUSE!! I bought this for my brother's Christmas present but now I'll need to get a copy for myself. It's too good to borrow back and forth like we usually do. This one goes in the permanent collection of concert DVD's.",1165190400,7,1005,4.408602150537634
8077252,5,B000AAO0RY,Elton is quite simply a genius. His piano work is the best ever. The band is far superior to any band out there.,1409961600,,112,3.9130434782608696
8077253,5,B000AAO0RY,"Awesome performances, but one must consider that there appears to be very little available in Elton's younger years in a live format.  My complaint about this one is that there is no real band __ just a percussionist and Elton.  Maybe it was something to do with Russia's security protocol.  Nevertheless, you have to take what you get and he still dishes it out very well on this disc.",1387411200,,386,4.565217391304348
8077254,5,B000AAO0RY,I am an Elton fan of many many years and never knew this DVD existed. It's amazing rare footage of concert prepping back in the day..the only minor drawback is the subtitles because this DVD is made for Latin audiences.,1351123200,,219,4.5
8077255,5,B000AAO0RY,Documentary with lots of great concert footage. Elton was the first western rock star invited into Russia. This was 1979 - before the fall of the Soviet Union. He was only allowed to bring percussionist Ray Cooper. Together they put on an amazing show. Plus there is great footage of Russian cities.,1350259200,,299,4.769230769230769
8077256,5,B000AAO0RY,"I originally watched this concert in the VHS format.  It's a fantastic view from the Russian point of view who were ""tolerating a Western Rock and Roller"" while the Iron Curtain was still up and trying to block out the western way of life. Here we go wild at concerts, singing along and dancing in the aisles. This film shows that is not allowed and Elton and Ray work their butts off trying to get the concert goers involved. A great addition to your concert dvds.",1292284800,,465,4.406976744186046
8077257,5,B000AAO0RY,"Years and years ago my oldest son and I saw this concert video when it was first broadcast. Since that was back in the days of the VCR when folks could tape a broadcast and keep the results for replay we did.  For many years we would get out this tape and view it again and again.

Alas tape wears out a little with each viewing.

When this same concert appeared on my son's wish list as a DVD we had to buy it for him.  He now lives 3000 miles away on the other side of the country. He tells us the DVD looks far better than he remembers the tape and the sound is really great.

This is Elton John at his best.  This concert is one where he was trying very hard to impress the russian audience but in so doing the camera captures him at his peak.

This DVD more than met our expectations.",1271980800,4,789,3.9556962025316458
8077258,5,B000AAO0RY,"Elton John was past his career high when this was filmed in 1979. Punk and New Wave were 'in' and Elton was seen as a dinosaur. Having announced his retirement from the stage 2 years earlier this was Eltons attempt to get back to basics.

The first half of the show is just Elton and Pianos. For anybody who is a fan this is reason enough to buy the DVD.
Its also worth saying that apart from a few chorus/tremelo effects the Piano sound is not cluttered with strings like on some modern recordings. His modern Piano generates a string sound based on what he's playing - which I don't like!

The second half of the show starts with Elton playing Funeral for a Friend and the entry of Ray Cooper. This is done in suitably dramatic style and Ray takes the show to a different level. Ray Cooper is a very talented all round musician and not only plays percussion (which he is famous for) but also adds more keyboards, vibraphone, marimba etc. He also has a great stage presence and on the evidence of this film almost steals the show from Elton John. With just the two of them some songs are transformed and I particularly liked the version of 'I Think I'm Going To Kill Myself' with Ray Cooper playing Marimba behind his back!

The documentary side of the film is pretty good and Elton John and Ray Cooper get to see many spectecular sites in Russia, and prove themselves to be a bit more intelligent than your average pop stars (we see them discussing which Grand Piano they would like at one point).
Fans will enjoy this, and I suspect that it would make a good introduction to those people who aren't diehards as well.",1183852800,,1619,4.408026755852843
