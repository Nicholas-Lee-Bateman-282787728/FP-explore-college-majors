8252926,5,B0013TPNQ8,"Buy far the best instructional artist. So far beyond basic flat tattoo flash. Very educated and experienced artist with the knowledge to explain the what, why, how of the craft. Absolutely hands down the most beneficial did I have seen and for all skill sets.",1474156800,,259,4.777777777777778
8252927,5,B0013TPNQ8,"Read my review on blk & grey, this is also a must have for any begginer. so much info from begging to end

great looking tat in the end, also how to use computer programs for script, & editing images, no info on Rotary machines both videos talk about coil machines. again great video I have it I have the black & grey, I have the
Mastering portraits with Franco Vescovi , Advanced tattooing techniques a guide to realism by joshua carlton I highly reccomend all 4 of these. The only video I have that I wouldnt reccomend due to being a waste of money is Welcome tattoo professional apprentice training series dvd 1 if that video is geared toward a proffesinal then I laugh at that video no real info",1368316800,,804,4.476190476190476
8252928,5,B0013TPNQ8,I have watched this video several times and its info is awesome. If you are a beginner and really care about what you tattoo on people then you have to get this video. Knowledge is power!!!,1359936000,,189,4.277777777777778
8252929,4,B0013TPNQ8,This is a really educational video it has tons of good info. The way he teaches everything is at a great pace and all the data is clear enough for a beginner.,1343174400,,158,3.96875
8252930,3,B0013TPNQ8,"He does tell you some essential things, he doesn't tell you what angle to hold your gun to ensure your ink is in the skin properly.  I guess you can just try and go by what you see. Which was something I was looking forward to. I wish he talked more about angles that were not good. I heard not the move your shader sideways from other people. I seen him do this in the DVD, maybe he was at a slight angle. I wish he would have shed some light on things like that. The do's and dont's of tattoos. The DVD skipped A LOT! when I got it there was a long scratch on it, and a bunch of smudges, I don't know how it got there, it was wrapped in plastic. So it was new. But like I said it skipped a lot, and the sound would cut out. He doesn't explain much about which colors look good together, he mentions the color wheel, to know more about colors that work together well, he just tells you to go buy a color wheel. A lot of his lines were shaky. I don't know if he was nervous or something. But, all the lines were not that bad, it seemed like the lines he was shaky on, he makes the thicker, and says that is what he wanted to do. Overall it wasn't a horrible DVD, it could have been a lot better. I honestly don't think its worth the money though. Perhaps he will someday put out another DVD that goes more into details, with some of the things that I mentioned.",1329091200,,1361,3.949090909090909
8252931,5,B0013TPNQ8,This is a great video... I also have the b&g video from Dean.  Worth every penny. Especially if you are trying to master those color transitions.  Deffinately Scratcher Approved!,1303516800,2,178,5.103448275862069
8252932,5,B0013TPNQ8,"Over the years I have purchased different videos and books about tattooing and learning tricks of the trade.  Dean Deakyne's Intro to Color DVD set is probably the best one I have purchased.  It is aimed toward the beginning tattoo artist who may not yet be familiar with techniques necessary for creating a successful tattoo. It's not corny or out dated like some instructional media can be.  Deakyne is a computer animator who I believe teaches at Gnomon in Los Angeles, the premeire 3-d animation education on the west coast.  Anyway back to the subject matter, not only does he cover design techniques and best practices in the more traditional sense but he also covers how Photoshop is an integral tool in the design process.  He thoroughly explains the electromagnetic coil machine using modern 3-d computer animations.  He shows you how to properly set up a sanitary tattoo station.  He covers proper stencil prep and application.  And then he executes a killer tattoo in real time, all the time explaining what he is doing and why he is doing it.  He covers building up line weight and grey lining. And he shows the best practices in terms of smooth color blends, when and where to leave blank skin, and what is the best order of colors to use.  All in all these are well worth the investment in anyone's tattoo education.  Highly recommended.",1268265600,3,1351,4.755364806866953
