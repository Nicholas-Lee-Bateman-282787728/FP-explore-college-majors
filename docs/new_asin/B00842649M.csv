An array of very good archive footage compliments some really good interviews all of which help this documentary move along nicely. Clear and concise, it is perfect for everyone; from the diehard fans to the casual observers. Great viewing!",1454371200,,319,5.037735849056604

8524932,5,B00842649M,"I just received and watched the ""Nirvana: The Final Chapter"" DVD and was unexpectedly surprised at how good the DVD is. It begins with an abbreviated synopsis of the progress of Nirvana's career. Not a lot of unnecessary time was spent on this area, instead devoting more time to the actual review of the In Utero album as the DVD claimed. The interviews were not the typical one and two liners we've heard over and over again by so-called experts. The people here are able to provide intelligent, thoughtful reviews of each of the tracks on the album without resorting to the typical ""yeah, this one is all about suicide and so is this one"". Thankfully not a lot of time was spent pouring over the whys of his death.
  It was nice to see how others outside America would see the songs. A lot of the interviews are people from Britain (as that is also where the company compiling this DVD is from). One of the extras on the disc is a listing of short descriptions of who each of the people interviewed are. Chad Channing, Jack Endino and Charles R. Cross were some of the more well-known people from America that Nirvana fans should be aware of already-and their credibility when it comes to Nirvana.
  The only negative I can say is that the video clips of Nirvana (and other bands) are a bit grainy. For the Nirvana parts, at least, you can always see the full, cleaner versions on other DVDs. On the positive side, it is the actual band's music you hear, not like a lot of other DVDs that have to use random ""kind of sounds like this band"" music.

Overall, I was greatly pleased with this purchase. Where else do you get all this and a Nirvana Quiz too?",1354752000,11,1656,4.416393442622951
