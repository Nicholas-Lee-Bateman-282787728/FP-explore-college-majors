624601,4,6303326838,"White is the transitional film in Kieslowski's Three Colours trilogy, falling between the magnificent Blue and the masterpiece that is Red. Julie Delpy turns in her best performance as the icy Dominique, who has divorced  her Polish husband who has become impotent. The husband devises a plan of  revenge against his wife, and the result is the film's best moment. The  enigmatic closing scene gives the film a more sinister aspect than  expected. Although not as good as the other two films in the trilogy, White  is beautifully shot and contains a beautiful musical score. Watch for  Juliette Binoche's blink and you'll miss it cameo in the divorce court.  You'll have to watch Blue to see why Binoche's character is in the  courthouse. Then watch Red's clever finale to see what has become of all  the characters in the trilogy.",916272000,9,831,4.878571428571429
624602,4,6303326838,"This film is the second in Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Trois  Couleurs"" trilogy (""Blue,"" ""White,"" and  ""Red,"" after the colors of the French flag).  While it contains  some quite surprising plot twists, overall it doesn't have the same  emotional impact as the first and last movies do.
 Zbigniew Zamachowski  plays Karol Karol, a Polish immigrant living in Paris with his wife,  Dominique (Julie Delpy).  As the film opens, Karol and Dominique are in  divorce court; she wants the divorce, he doesn't. She wins, and he is left  with nothing but a large suitcase -- in which he manages to send himself  back to Poland, with unexpected results.
 While white is traditionally  the color of marriage, in this film it is the color of divorce.  Throughout  the movie the sky is a bleak, almost colorless shade of white, reflecting  Karol's mood.  The divorce proceedings take place in a white marble  courtyard, and after the hearing Dominique drives away in a white car.  When Karol returns to Poland, the countryside is buried under a layer of  snow.  More than that, the color symbolizes the sterility of their  marriage: Dominique's grounds for divorce are that the marriage has never  been consummated.
 For the rest of the film, Karol struggles to rebuild  his life and to win back Dominique.  The movie is enjoyable, with highly  original subplots. The actors turn in fine performances, and the direction  (as one would expect from Kieslowski) is intriguing without being  heavy-handed.  However, for a film that focuses on such emotional topics as  love and death, it fails to rouse intense emotions in the viewer.  END",904348800,18,1618,4.9849056603773585
624642,5,6303326838,"The main character (Karol) parades his sorry self through the horrific destitution of identity, propelling his dejected preverbal self through a spiral of rejection which seems to be compounded with every turn he takes.  The pigeon defecating on him certainly symbolizes that even the symbolic has termed him worthy only of excrement (as the image of his wedding appears, his beautiful wife running and the pigeons flying away, allowing the horizon to shine light on the newly-born couple).  Excrement breeds excrement, he is returned to Poland and emerges in a dump, where he is unceremoniously reminded that the world rejects him, even without any good reason.  The tone of the film shies away from just perpetuating silliness and wanton punishment, which makes a lot of sense.  The only friend he finds has his own fatalistic journey chiseled in mud (...), the responsibility of which is too overbearing to deal with alone.  Clearly Karol, despite being able to encounter wealth, is still completely enamored with his ex-wife; again, their communication was always based on primitive grounding... she said herself that any words of connection / affection would fall on deaf ears, so to speak.  The reason for the marriage to end and the manner in which she cruelly punishes him on the phone do indeed sink to the utmost nonverbal level, and in this universe, intelligence is not even ballast.  It is these primordial noises that transcend all forms of logic that indeed define his value as not only a husband but a human being.  The unwanted wretch he represented to her could not sustain himself despite material gain.  Regardless of the denouement and its perverse connotations, Karol did indeed need to destroy his former self in order to create a sense of desire in Dominique; she became attracted to the born-again, fully verbal, sexually potent man, and the climax during the sex scene radiates white light in a demonstration of a new unity being forged.  However, he cannot look at her in the aftermath.  When his fantasy fell apart in the materialization of his libidinal wishes, he could not maintain himself in this new life in its purest sense, he had to pervert it.  In doing so, fantasy and libido are recreated, in a haphazard and messy way.  The deadness in the couple is sustained at first by Dominique, then later by Karol, and these 2 ""walking corpses"" cannot juxtapose themselves chronologically in order to fulfill the requirements of a happy marriage or a mutual separation.  In the end, the element of an odd voyeuristic pleasure of creating a 3rd conjugal reality projected somewhere in the unknown future comes into play, but the realization of this is left purely to interpretation.",1283212800,,2710,4.980044345898005

624644,1,6303326838,"I'd been meaning to see these movies for years and I am extremely disappointed.  A couple months later, I don't remember what happened in Bleu.  I saw White a few days ago and laughed frequently - not at the humor but at the sheer absurdity of the plot developments.  This was some of the laziest screen writing I can remember seeing in a movie that was not an action movie.

For example, the main character, who is a hair dresser of all professions, double crosses a pair of mobsters he works with, on a land deal.  Not only do they not beat the s$#@ out of him, they actually pay him 10 times what he paid for the land - though a couple of minutes earlier they had said that they expected to make 3 times their investment.  Those numbers don't add up.  Sloppy, sloppy.  It also doesn't say where he came up with a shoebox full of money to buy the land. Did he steal it, save it, find it?  Leaving details like this out aren't artistic, they're just lazy!

Then he starts a big import/export business with this money and money from a friend but he misses Dominique oh so much.  So, rather than trying to win her back now that he's got his mojo back, he decides to fake his own death and go to Hong Kong and then frame Dominique for his murder - or something?  I wasn't clear what exactly was going on or what he hoped to accomplish.  And I didn't care in the slightest.  I just wanted the movie to be over so that I could do something more productive - like watch a sitcom.

Actors often talk about finding their motivation when acting.  Screenwriters and storytellers must do the same or they create plots and characters that fail at entertainment and symbolism.  This movie is rife with characters making decisions that aren't consistent with basic human motivations.

I don't think I want to watch the third installment.",1233532800,3,1824,4.394029850746269

624646,4,6303326838,"The middle film of Polish-French film director Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colors (Trois Couleurs) trilogy of Blue, White, and Red is a very black comedy, and generally considered the weakest of the three films. This is true, although, given the high quality of the tercet, White (Blanc) is still an excellent film, and compared with the mind-numbing comedies that Hollywood regularly cranks out, it is exceptional. And, at a mere hour and a half, this 1994 film never drags on too long. However, one of the major misconceptions about the film and its hero, Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski)- literally Charley Charley, is that he is a Chaplinesque figure. I believe that the many critics who use this term intend it as a high compliment, as they reference the greatest of the silent era screen stars, Charlie Chaplin, and his character of The Tramp. But, in doing so, they show how little they understand of the character and its portrayer.
  There is a range of emotion that The Tramp shows in both the short subjects and feature films he appears in that none of the actors whose performances have subsequently been compared with his have displayed. There have never been moments the equal of the roll dance in The Gold Rush, nor the ending of City Lights, where the blind girl realizes her seemingly rich benefactor is The Tramp, nor the scenes of modernity run amok in Modern Times, nor the dance with the globe in The Great Dictator. This is not to demean any of the later performances, for some, such as Giulieta Masina's role as Gelsomina in Federico Fellini's La Strada, or that of Zamachowski in White are excellent, but none rally come close to that Chaplinesque mix of lightheartedness and dark pathos. Karol, as example, is a far more dismal and dark character than any played by Chaplin. Right from the start there is something `off' about him. In Hollywood a character like his might end up a serial killer or child molester.
  That all said, White is a delightful if flawed comedy, and had it been a Hollywood film it would probably rank much higher in critical opinion worldwide. It's merely because American minds have been so cauterized by bad art that a film like this has to be judged against its superior European counterparts, and its own siblings in the Three Colors trilogy, rather than the minor leagues that American cinema represents. Were it judged against the standard fart comedy mindset, or that of the tired `romantic comedy' formulae, it would be seen in a far greater light. Regardless, it is well worth seeing, and a good way to spend an evening. When was the last romantic comedy from America that such a claim could be made for?",1222214400,,2667,4.778741865509762

624648,5,6303326838,"White (Krzysztof Kieslowski, 1994)

When I mentioned to people that I was in the midst of watching Three Colours, Kieslowski's celebrated film trilogy, for the first time, to a person, I got the same reaction: ""oh, Blue is my favorite of the three, but the other two are really good as well!"" Of course, if you've been following along, you know me: if there's a sacred cow around, I have an overwhelming urge to turn it into shish-kebab, and that may be part of the reason that, now that I've given myself a few weeks' perspective from all three films, I've landed on White as my favorite of the three. But it could also be that White is the film that, in some odd way that I can't quite put my finger on, most reminded me of Dekalog, my favorite Kieslowski offering. Even though Blue has the most surface connection to Dekalog, White has a great deal of that same mindset going on under the hood. Kieskowski's masterful morality play would have fit right in with Dekalog, I think.

The wonderfully-named Karol Karol (The Call of the Toad's Zbigniew Zamachowski) is a Polish expatriate barely getting by in Paris. His lovely young wife Dominique (Killing Zoe's Julie Delpy) has just divorced him after only six months, and he finds himself homeless. While playing a comb in the metro to pick up spare change, he meets Mikolaj (Aquarium's Janusz Gajos), a wealthy Polish businessman who wants Karol to come back to Poland with him to perform a service (saying what would be a spoiler). Things turn out unexpectedly in Poland, and Karol, who has never forgotten Dominique's betrayal, alternately tries to go on with his life without her and concocts absurd schemes to win her back.

I think one of the reasons I liked White more than the other two films is that, of the Kieslowski works I've seen (all the major films at this point, and a few of the shorts-- not nearly as many as I'd like), it's the out-and-out funniest; it requires a warped sense of humor, to be sure, but Karol is without doubt meant to be a comic figure, and Zamachowski's hapless portrayal is spot-on. Karol never feels entirely comfortable in his skin, whether he's on top of the world or at the bottom of the trash heap, and it's Zamachowski's excellent portrayal of Karol that makes this film a success as much as it is Kieslowski's impressive directorial skills. Whereas Juliette Binoche's character in Blue was never less than self-assured, even when she was entirely lost, Karol is her opposite; he's never self-assured even when he's most found. And yet neither Zamachowski nor Kieslowski ever overplay their hands; Karol is usually at least sympathetic, if not outright pathetic, but Zamachowski does it so well that even the well-worn clich that forms the final movement of the film comes off as fresh and inviting.

White is Kieslowski at his finest, easily on a par with episodes five and seven of Dekalog. I cannot recommend the films of Kieslowski highly enough, if you haven't already experienced them; while I'd suggest starting with Dekalog, it does represent a serious chunk of time, and Three Colours gives you a taste of the genius without having to invest eleven hours and change. **** ",1216339200,5,3177,4.737793851717902
624649,5,6303326838,"Karol ( Zbigniew Zamachowski ) is disposed by his wife, Dominique ( Julie Delpy ) and forced to go back to his home country, Poland. Then, he thinks of and begins to plan the revenge to her, supported by his friend, Mikolaj ( Janusz Gajos ). When he becomes a successful businessman, it's the time to carry out his PLAN to acquire equality...
 White implies purity and innocence, but also means equality. This film tells how a man acquires the equality with his wife.
 Oscar nominee and the star of ""Before Sunset"", Julie Delpy portrays Dominique as icy beauty. Zamachowski plays a clueless man well. The story is depicted as somewhat comedic but serious touch. The friendship between Karol and Mikolaj is interesting. This movie received the winner of the best director award at the Berlin Film Festival.
 Director Kieslowski is prominent in the unique expression. He effectively uses silence, unique behavior, metaphor, minimum speech, and beautiful music. These effects give deep impression. For instance, some funny moments are depicted by serious touch in this film. Also, an old lady appears through the three colors trilogy. It is interesting that Julie( Blue ), Karol( White ), and Valentine( Red ) react differently toward the old lady.
 The three colors trilogy is the masterpiece of Kieslowski and consists of three films ("" Blue"", ""White"", and ""Red"" ) . The colors of French flag means liberty, equality, fraternity. Director Kieslowski expressed these themes through the movies. If you like Kieslowski's movie, you will like it.",1204070400,,1541,5.07905138339921

This second film of the series is a basically enjoyable and easy to follow (though not simple) story of a very inconspicuous Polish man. After 6 months married to a beautiful French woman, his wife divorces him and leaves him stranded in Paris, with no money and nowhere to go. Once he gets back to Poland, after many miseries, his luck will change and he will start to plan his revenge.

There lies the 'equality or justice' of the story of 'White'. It is very funny to see the transformation of this man from a pitiable and abused person to a completely different one: socially and personally; intellectually and sexually. The transformation of this man parallels that of Poland itself from a bleak Soviet puppet nation to a member of the rich European Club, with all the possibilities involved.

A Very enjoyable black comedy.",1173398400,,883,4.758169934640523
624658,5,6303326838,"The 2nd installment of Krzystof Kieslowski's Three Colors Trilogy, ""White"" is, in my opinion,

better than the previous installment ""Blue."" I find myself surprised to say this, since ""Blue"" is a masterpiece, but ""White"" is as well and happens to be funny, entertaining, well-acted, sad, and moving. What else could you ask for? While the protagonist in ""Blue"" was a cold woman (played by Juliette Binoche) reeling from the loss of her husband and child, ""White"" has a man as a protagonist despite the fact that it is Julie Delpy who graces the cover of the film. The movie stars Zbigniew Zamachowski as Karol, a Polish immigrant who has lost everything to his wife Dominique (Delpy) in divorce court. Desperate to get out of Paris and back into post-Communist Poland, he befriends a man named Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos) who happens to be heading to Poland himself. In one of the films great scenes, they hatch a plan to get Karol back into Poland by having him hide himself inside his suitcase and be shipped there. Problem is, when Mikolaj gets off the plane and goes to retrieve his ""luggage"" he finds that the suitcase is not there. It has been stolen by thieves, who break the lock and (finding only Karol) beat him and leave him there. When he wakes up, he looks around and yells ""home at last!"" As the movie continues, Karol tries to get his life back together by making lots of money with one goal in mind...Get revenge on Dominique.

This leads to a touching, terrific climax that is truly the perfect way to end the film. The more films I see by Kieslowski (I've seen 2/3 of ""The Decalogue"" and ""Blue), the more I appreciate him and begin to agree with Roger Ebert that he was one of the best filmmakers. His films are so well made and so well written, and they all seem so real. While ""Blue"" was, essentially, a tragedy; ""White"" could fall into the category of ""dark comedy."" So it's a film that might appeal to a broader audience. As for the acting, it's superb. Gajos and Zamachowski are superb; I really can't imagine better actors in the roles. Delpy has limited screen-time, but eats up this role. The DVD has a lot of interesting Bonus Features, including Delpy reflecting on Kieslowski. If you haven't seen the Three Colors Trilogy, I recommend you rent/buy ""Blue"" now. These are films that shouldn't be missed.

624659,2,6303326838,"What the ----.  ""A tale of revenge""?  Why does everyone in their review say that?  B/c it's written on the box cover??  This is an interesting and compelling movie, but w/ a very odd, abrupt ending that leaves you hitting the ""REWIND"" button and saying, ""what a minute, is it OVER??  Did I miss something??""

Afte watching this, I scoured the internet, Wikipeida, and Amazon...still no reviewer seems able to say what was meant by the ending of this film.  My takeaway on it -- she is going to hang, and die (go to heaven);  he is going to stay on Earth..but maybe when they meet again (heaven), they can get married.  ??

????

How come no one else can come up w/ a definitive meaning to the end of this film?  Subtlety is great, but not if it's so damn ambiguous that NOBODY in the universe seems to be able to define or explain what this film was all about.  It was NOT about revenge.  Maybe it was about love and obsession and sadness and the silliness of despair.

As the movie progressed, my rating dropped to somewhere between three and four, so clearly the first half of the movie is better than the second.  The ending was so disappointing that I had to drop my rating to two stars.

It is about a Polish man in France who marries a French girl but is divorced by her because he is unable to make love to her.

He returns to Poland without her, manages to get rich, and comes up with a plot to get revenge on his beloved Dominique.  The problem with this writing is that he loves her, so why is he plotting revenge against her?  It is senseless.

The ending is utterly surreal.  She should hate him for what he has done to her, but she is smiling to him.  He is looking at her and crying.  He has betrayed her in a cruel way.  He doesn't have the right to be crying for her.  That is like Hitler crying for the Jews.  He is still in a position to help her out, but he won't.  It's really pretty sickening.

The story becomes unclear enough as it is, without adding some fantasy scenes or memories about a wedding and a kiss.  It left me angrily saying ""What the hell is going on?""  I really hate it when a director becomes unclear and plays with the audience.  I don't find that cute at all.  Tell the damn story and tell it clearly.

The impossibility of a simple man to satisfy his couple will reach bindings of unsuspected turns; an unexpected journey from Paris to Warsaw, will become of him an energy outburst, the expected redemption has to be done in the middle of the corrupt battlefield.

The narrative style of Kielowski demands of you all the possible attention. His films possess conceptual density ornamented with visible visual metaphors; the tragedy and collapse of his beloved Poland appears beneath the absorbing script with unadorned realism. I would like to you recommend to watch previously his Decalogue. This fact will allow you to appreciate with major intensity the rat of this unforgettable genius. His sensible vanishing left a very remarkable void, which still remains, pitifully without successor.

624662,4,6303326838,"Equality-the state or instance of being equal;  especially, the state of enjoying equal rights, as political, economic, and social.

""What about equality?"" demands Polish migr and hairdresser Karol Karol to the judge during his divorce hearings.  Was the judge not hearing his case just because he couldn't speak French?  Karol's French wife, the lovely Dominique, has filed divorce charges against him because he can't perform in bed.  This leaves Karol in a pinch, as Dominique has tossed him and his suitcase out into the street, having been awarded the house and bank account.  Furthermore, it does fit the theme of equality in the second of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Tricoleurs trilogy, Blanc (French), or Bialy (Polish).  Dominique has the advantage of knowing French and French law.  Karol doesn't.  The only thing is for him to return back to Poland, which he does, in a suitcase!

Fortunately, he has his brother Jurek, running his hairdressing salon, and Mikolaj (pron. Mikolai), a fellow Pole who has promised him a job, to kill someone who wants to take his own life but can't, for which he'll pay handsomely.  Yet Karol tells his target that we all want less pain in our lives and the technique he uses to dissuade his target is ingenious.  I mean, can one see Karol, who's a nice, maybe too nice a guy, as a killer?

The colour symbolism of white works here as did blue for the first film in the trilogy.  Karol and Mikolaj run around in the snow as if they were kids.  From that point on, the white symbolizes a clean slate, where Karol's comeback begins.  Much of the scenery in Poland is against an overcast gray-white sky, but that provides the backdrop for his rejuvenation.  He's back home, where he becomes knowledgeable about the new post-Communist Poland and other things he learns to make it as a businessman.  And it is there that he decides to get back at his ex-wife.  Personally, I thought he was too lenient with her.

Zbigniew Zamachowski shines as Karol, as does Janusz Gajos as the gloomy Mikolaj.  Julie Delpy is pretty but unsympathetic as Dominique, which was the point of the movie.  The vicious way she humiliates Karol that drives him back to Poland, most men would consider unforgivable.  Yet she's like a bookend, figuring in the beginning and final parts of White.  Oh, and Juliette Binoche, star of Blue, has a brief wordless cameo in the beginning, where she can be seen at the rear of the court chambers talking to the guards while Karol's hearing is in progress.

To the extent that being at home in one's country and knowing the laws and people there makes people equal to one another, but only within the confines of their borders, which is a stark contrast to Blue, where one of the subplots involved a concerto for European unification.

Premise:  Little Polish guy living in Paris, an adorable and prize-winning hair dresser, is divorced by his beautiful French wife, whom he loves passionately, because he can't...perform, or at least can't perform long enough.  She is unhappy with him, VERY unhappy.  She takes everything from him but a trunk and even calls the gendarmes and tells them he is burning down what is now her salon after he fails her one last time.  I guess this is the ultimate fury from a woman scorned, although he sure wishes he wasn't scorning her.

He ends up on his knees in the Metro playing his comb for francs to get enough to eat.  Then he arranges to get sent back to Poland in a trunk. After some mishaps he makes his fortune.  It would be unfair to reveal anymore of the plot since it is so, so clever...  But the ""white"" of the title is for a Polish dinner roll and the snow of Poland and for sheets of legal paper and for the white walls of new enterprises and especially for the white light of her orgasm.

Julie Delpy, who plays the very frustrated wife, is pretty enough to go to extremes for, and Zbigniew Zamachowski who plays the lead, is convincing in a role that borders on the silly.  Memorable for his sly portrayal of a bored-with-life, bridge-playing professional is Janusz Gajos.

This is the second in the ""Trois Couleurs"" trilogy by Polish/French director Krzysztof Kieslowski.

The theme of equality, second word of the French slogan, is evident here perhaps as a statement that equality does not reflect reality, and that we are engaged constantly in a search for the upper hand, and that life is for the opportunist.

624665,4,6303326838,"White can be pure or empty, bleak or beautiful. And ""White"" is also the second volume of Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Three Colors Trilogy,"" a witty and sharp tragicomedy about revenge. It's also the weak point hanging between the melancholy ""Blue"" and vibrant ""Red,"" with its less likable characters and more unbelievable plotline.
Hairdresser Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) is being coldly divorced by his beautiful wife Dominique (Julie Delpy) because she is sexually dissatisfied with him. She also strips him of his money and possessions, leaving him playing pitiful music at the subways. What's more, she rubs it in his face that she's now having sex with other men.
Things can't get worse, right? Wrong: Karol goes back to Poland and ends up getting beaten up and robbed. Via some not-so-legal methods, Karol builds himself an impressive fortune and becomes determined to get back at his cold, manipulative ex-wife. Amid a web of killing, seduction and faked death, Karol finds the perfect method to bring Dominique down...
""White"" is certainly a successful black comedy -- it's sort of weirdly, freakily funny. Unfortunately, it's also the weakest of Kieslowski's ""Colors"" movies -- some of the plot devices seem too unbelievable (like Karol shipping himself in a trunk), and the tricks and twists of the plot are a little too much to swallow. However, the twisted love/hate relationship between Dominique and Karol is fascinating, and Karol's revenge is devilishly clever for what seems like a nice, goofy little man.
White is the color of wedding dresses and various other marriage-related things. But here, it's nothing so nice: an anti-color, a space where color isn't. It's snow, it's emptiness, it's colorless, it's passionless. Kieslowski's black comedy is sprinkled with white -- white cars, white skies, white marble, white snow. There's less grace in Kieslowski's direction, but the images he creates are still breathtakingly pretty and subtle. (The ""sign language"" scene is evidence enough)
Zamachowski has an underrated turn as Karol Karol. He seems like a nice, sweet guy who takes one kick in the teeth after another, kind of like a lost puppy. In a word: Loser. In another word: Wimp. Then he shows his dark side -- one that, on the outside, nobody would think Karol had. And Delpy does a lovely job making Dominique into a malicious schemer, without making her two-dimensionally nasty.
This droll dark comedy is a bit flawed, but it shows Kieslowski's unmistakable style and wit, and the acting is nearly impeccable. Call it a portrait in ""White.""",1080950400,4,2570,5.150717703349282

WHITE is one in a trilogy of French films also comprising BLUE and RED.
As the film opens, Polish emigre Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) arrives in a Parisian court for his divorce hearing. His wife, the ravishing Dominique (Julie Delpy), is giving him the toss because he no longer satisfies her sexually, although she admits he was hot stuff when they first met in Warsaw.
After the dissolution of the marriage is decreed, Dominique dumps Karol's possessions, all contained in a large trunk, into the car park and drives off. Karol soon discovers that she's also cut off his access to their joint bank account. Karol, now down and out and soliciting handouts in the Paris Metro, absorbs the abuse without any overt sign of anger, even after his ex figuratively pushes his nose into the fact that she's copulating with another man. Karol is the meekest and most inoffensive of men. Let's not mince words; he's a wimp.
With the help of another Pole, Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), Karol returns to Warsaw by an unusual route. Once arrived, he literally ends up in a ditch. Rock bottom is a hard place.
Karol is an award-winning hairdresser, and he begins working in his brother's beauty shop. Through good luck and a series of shrewd moves unrelated to the hair trade, he becomes rich. And it's also clear that he remains obsessed with Dominique.
WHITE is somewhat less subtle than BLUE, and therefore demands less cerebral exercise on the part of the viewer; BLUE tries too hard to be obscure. Karol is an enormously endearing character, much like a puppy that's been kicked. And, though we don't know what his grand strategy is, we recognize that he has a plan that he's clearly implementing. The lovely Juliette Binoche in BLUE is a more aloof figure as she struggles to recover from a family tragedy, and it's only from close-ups of her face that the audience can infer what's going on inside. WHITE is thus, to this viewer, the more satisfying of the two.
Zamachowski's performance is solid, and Mikolaj is the friend that anybody could hope for. And Delpy's Dominique is eye candy that would drive any sober man on a fevered quest.
It's said that revenge is a dish that's best eaten cold, and WHITE suggests such a meal. The very last scene strongly implies, however, that Karol ultimately lacks the requisite dispassion.",1052956800,6,2339,4.792079207920792

624691,4,6303326838,"'White' is a refreshing improvement on its portentous predecessor 'Blue', a dazzling tragicomedy about an impotent Polish hairdresser, Karol, who is unceremoniously divorced by his Parisian wife, thrown out onto the streets without a sou, a possport or much French.  Busking on the Metro, he meets a fellow Pole, the lugubrious Mikolaj, who smuggles him back to their home country.  Determined to exact revenge on his wife, Karol begins to trade very profitably on the black market.
Maybe it's because Kieslowski is back in Poland, but 'White' is a much 'lighter' film than its predecessor, not in the sense of insubstantial, but in the director's relaxing the grip of his elaborate style, allowing his effects emanate from his story, his wonderful characters and the Polish landscape overlooking the post-communist embrace of (crooked) Western capitalism.  Though still glossy compared to his earlier films, the relentless striving for poetic preciosity that marred 'Blue' is checked.  Perhaps the return to Poland allowed Kieslowski to make an authentically East European film, a kind of absurdist shaggy dog story, its black comedy aching with anguish.  The almost-ridiculous, little-man clown-hero could have bumbled from Gogol or Kafka (or silent cinema?), rumpled, besuited, a bit roly-poly, self-important despite being victim to a fate with a very sick, humiliating sense of humour - his admiring gaze at one of the film's many pigeons ends with dirt sliming down his shirt, just before a court appearance; the bank teller who cuts his frozen credit card is suitably, bureaucratically, inexorably faceless.
The film's comic tension emerges from the disparity between the character's unintentional individuality, his being made seem eccentric because of the unfortunate things inflicted on him, and others' reaction to him; and his dehumanisation, both comically, as he is smuggled by suitcase to Poland, a devalued commodity fetish, only to be purloined by airport thieves, and, more bleakly, in the hardening of his soul as he becomes more successful at being a capitalist - the ironic message of 'White' seems to be that money and power is the key to sexual potency.  Karol's natural self was deemed a social failure, so he has to play a part, even if it risks killing his soul, even if he must play a corpse, become his own ghost though he tries to assert the primacy of his body.  His progress is symbolised in the film by the importance of language (translating, interpreting and misunderstanding), with epiphany only possibly with its transcendence in a physical, non-verbal communication, perhaps the human equivalent of what Kieslowski tried to do in his films, reach viewers through pure cinema.
Like 'Blue', and all his films, 'White' is structured around recurring and reconfigured imagery - birds, suitcases, glass, statues, combs, 'lucky' coins, snow etc., - but, again, because they  belong to the story's world, rather than being imposed on it by a style, they seem much more effective.
'White' isn't perfect - the plot is damaged by nagging implausibilities, and the film certainly dips in the second half, but that's inevitable after the fleet comic energy preceeding it, swept along by the tango melodies of Zbigniew Preisner's score, a welcome contrast to the bombast of 'Blue', and again more rooted to place.  Once again, Kieslowski's irony, his play with viewpoint and fantasy, suggests we don't take his images or plot developments at face value.",1022198400,11,3477,5.239208633093525

624693,3,6303326838,"After Bleu, which is the first installment of Kieslowski's Bleu, Blanc, Rouge loosely connected trilogy, I expected something better than White. I guess I just should not get my hopes up! First of all Julie Delpy is one of the two stars of this film which naturally creates a need for me not to like it. And she did not disappoint. Her cruel character is horrible in this film, which was of course deliberate, but somehow I just did not like her in the role even if she was effective. She divorces her Polish hairdresser husband, played very convincingly by Zbigniew Zamachowski, because he is supposedly impotent. She also drives him out of France and taunts him with her other sexual exploits. He eventually returns to his native Poland after he has by chance met another fellow Polish national who offers him a job. All he has to do is kill a man who is too weak to commit suicide and he will receive a large sum of money. In the meantime, Zamachowski works during his days and eventually steals some business plans from someone and becomes a very wealthy man. He and the Polish man he met before leaving France are in business together. Then the day comes that the man tells Zamachowski that the man wants to die. When Z. arrives to do the deed he discovers that the man wanting to commit suicide is one and the same man as his business partner and friend. He agrees to shoot him, but he shoots him with a blank in case the man changes his mind. In the end, Zamachowski decides to stage his own death and leave all the money to his former wife. Delpy arrives for the mock funeral and then Zamachowski meets her in her hotel room, has sex with her and leaves her in the morning. The police arrive the following morning and arrest her for his murder. Perfect revenge, but overall it seemed a bit... petty. However, do buy the soundtrack to this film.",982800000,6,1852,4.45
624694,5,6303326838,"In downtown Warsaw, where so much of ""White"" is set, there was an electric sign celebrating Poland's recent release from the Iron Curtain of communism by praising Bill Clinton and splashing around an American  flag. The electric sign, though, was not like the monumental Panasonic sign  in New York's Times Square. Rather it was more comparable to the signs  composed of light bulbs that can be found in major league baseball  stadiums.  I thought of that sign many times throughout ""White,""  how meager it looked in a nation already so deprived.  ""White""  deals with the disillusionment and failure of one man who represents the  disappointment of a nation. When the protagonist, Karol, returns to Warsaw  from Paris, after being rejected and betrayed by his French wife,  Dominique, through divorce and infidelity, and by the French court, whom  Karol believes has cheated him in the divorce by giving him nothing because  he cannot speak French (both a clear metaphor for the West's disregard of  Poland), he is greeted by a city where bands of thieves roam the land like  the Middle Ages, and gangster capitalists own everything and can buy  anything. Karol then aspires to become part of this amoral ruling class,  thereby becoming more equal than anybody else. In ""White,""  besides the inequitable wealth between Karol and his fellow Polish  countrymen,  there is an intricate interplay between the affluence of the  West and the lowered expectations of Poland. In Paris, Karol and is wife  owned a clean well-lit salon, but back in Warsaw, his brother's salon has  little more than a gaudy electric sign to distinguish it from the days of  communist rule, and it is located along a muddy, unpaved road. A loan  shark, who hires Karol to protect him, gives Karol what amounts to a cap  gun as his weapon. And even an expensive office building in downtown Warsaw  only has a few phone jacks. This comparison is perhaps Kieslowski's message  that there is no perfect equality, either within a nation (as demonstrated  through both Karol's amassed wealth and influence, and the discrimination  against his at the hands of the French judicial system) or between nations.  Kieslowski also suggests, through the relationship between Karol and  Dominique, that perhaps love can bridge this gap.",964656000,9,2293,5.032

Along the way (like the other two films in this trilogy), there's symbolism depicting key points in the plot. Another component of telling the story in each of the three films is the use of the color depicted in each title; in this case, white is seen throughout, though more subtly than the other two films. I thought the plot of this film was not your typical revenge plot, as it wasn't so predictable, and catches the viewer off guard in some cases.

7843449,5,6303326838,"Krzysztof Kielowskis Three Colours White is the wonderful centerpiece of his equally wonderful Three Colours Trilogy. I loved it when I first saw it in the cinema in 1994 and repeated viewings over the intervening 22 years haven't dulled its brilliance, indeed watching it repeatedly for this review has simply made it seem greater still. For reasons I cant fathom this one is seen by many as the weakest of the three films. Perhaps its comedy and its entertaining event-filled plot make it appear slight and obvious when placed beside the polished ambiguities and plush visual sheen of both Blue and Red. All I can say is perhaps people haven't looked hard enough, for this film is fully the equal of its companions. We should evaluate this Trilogy as three films belonging together first and foremost and if Blue and Red make up the heavy, deeply serious metaphysical bread of the sandwich, then White is the light and delicious, but no less deeply serious metaphysical meat that makes up the center.

The initial inspiration for the Trilogy came from Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Kielowskis writer-partner since No End (1984). Piesiewicz had also inspired the magnificent Dekalog series of TV films made on the Ten Commandments and the Trilogy started off with his idea to make a film where the commanding dictums of Dekalog are understood in a wider context. In the aftermath of the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe in the late 80s, this wider context was a West European society determined by the ideals of the French Revolution, namely liberty, equality and fraternity depicted in the French flag as blue, white and red respectively. Why not try to see how the Ten Commandments function today, what our attitude to them is and how the three words liberty, equality and fraternity function today?  on a very human, intimate and personal plane (Kielowski). Kielowski and Piesiewicz made the decision to make three films on these ideals, but understood audaciously as contradictions or even as impossibilities. In White equality is explored as an ideal sort after by its main protagonist, but who finds no such thing exists. As Kielowski says, I don't think anyone wants to be equal. Everybody wants to be more equal.

As with both Blue and Red, the key to understanding the hidden complexities of White lies in paying attention to the narrative structure and the way two sequences book end everything that lies in between. The film begins and ends with sequences in places connected with the legal process. It begins in the court of law in Paris where a Polish immigrant barber Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) is fighting a divorce suit filed by his French wife Dominique (Julie Delpy). His entrance into the building accompanied by a pigeon defecating on his shoulder is intercut with a suitcase on a conveyor belt going somewhere in an airport. Blue and Red also both open on sequences which visualize the abstract mechanisms which course underneath our benign everyday lives and 20 minutes into the film we realize that the suitcase we saw at the beginning depicts Karols fate, that his court battle is doomed to failure. The grounds for divorce are humiliating. He is impotent and has not been able to consummate his 6 month marriage. This basic inequality is writ large by the divorce where he loses his liberty, equality and fraternity as an immigrant living ironically in the land supposedly representative of these ideals. He ends up destitute on the Paris streets and the opening court scene charts his complete humiliation. 85 minutes later at the other end of our narrative the film ends with a scene inside the grounds of a prison in Warsaw. This time it is Karol who stands victorious outside while Dominique resides defeated behind prison bars, the victim of his exquisitely planned revenge to regain his equality by getting even with her.

The essence of this films narrative lies in a tit-for-tat exploration of what lawyers call lex talionis, the code of justice which calls for punishment to be meted out to the transgressor in exact relation to the offense committed. An extreme example of this would be a murderer having to forfeit his own life. Here in White Karol responds to Dominiques theft of his equality by stealing hers in return. It is well to remember Piesiewicz is a lawyer first and foremost who was very successful in Poland during the late 70s and through the period of martial law. All his screenplays for Kielowski involve ethical inquiry and legal conundrums centered on what is right and wrong in the conduct of everyday life. In this Trilogy the law gradually exerts its pervasive presence with increasing power as it progresses. In Blue we noticed Julie dealing with ethical matters of legal ownership and deploying a lawyer to settle her inherited estate. That film hinges on Julies discovery that her deceased husband was carrying on an affair with the lawyer Sandrine and theres a key scene at the very same Paris law court we see in White in which Julie stumbles on Sandrine sitting beside Dominique as Karol begs the court for equality, the two films briefly crossing over. We even notice the same low camera angle used to accompany both Julie and Karol rushing up the courthouse steps in their respective films. The law exerts a stronger grip on White with its courthouse/prison framing and its central depiction of lex talionis, and in Red its presence is suffocatingly omnipresent with a narrative centering on two judges and various legal questions in Geneva, Switzerland, the home of European law and the place where law is legislated for a whole continent. All of this is reflected in the way the three colours are used. As the Trilogy progresses and the law exerts its progressively stronger grip so the colour blue (liberty) disappears from view. The colour saturates Blue and the section of White which takes place in France. It is used sparingly with specific point when the film moves to Poland, but it is completely absent from Red which in visual terms is a symphony in red and white. As the law becomes stronger so freedom (blue) vanishes for the sake of the greater fraternity (red) that universal laws promulgate, the only equality (white) allowed being the one bestowed by the over-riding law maker rendered by Kielowski as Judge Joseph Kern who on the highest level represents God Himself.

In the Trilogy it is important to grasp that behind the law lies religion, specifically Christianity. In basic terms Blue is centrally about the resurrection of Julie through a display of charity and a renunciation of liberty in favor of universal love. This is made crystal-clear by the use of words from the Bible (1 Corinthians 13: 1-13) in the concluding montage. To the best of my knowledge no words are quoted directly from the Bible in White, but the concept of lex talionis originated in Hebrew law as laid out by God through Moses in the Old Testament: If there is serious injury, you take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise (Exodus 21: 23-25). Karols enacting of lex talionis entails his resurrection, his return to potency and the wresting back of a sense of equality in relation to Dominique. The problem is he discovers at the end that he isn't equal. He simply becomes more equal, but a happy end is achieved partly because he never stops loving Dominique and party because he eventually refracts lex talionis as voiced by Moses through the revised wording of the same justice code in the New Testament. In the Sermon on the Mount Christ says: You have heard it said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But I say to you, do not resist an evildoer. If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also (Matthew 5: 38-39). Through the main body of the narrative Karol sets about exacting his revenge which involves faking his own death and jailing Dominique for the murder. However, love intervenes and as he stands outside the prison window watching her mime her love to him and tears streaming down his face we know this man doesnt go to Hong Kong as he was planning. Somehow he extricates his wife from jail and returns to his former identity together with her as we see at the end of Red. Karol learns to turn the other cheek, to modify lex talionis as Christ tells us to. This makes White a very loose and irreverent Biblical allegory with Karol taking on some of the attributes of Christ Himself.

The film is no passion play, but we certainly notice the number of times Karol is referred to as Jesus. When he makes his undignified return to his home country being dragged out of his stolen suitcase by thieves on a snow-bound rubbish dump overlooked by a church and to the sound of actual church bells, he announces his arrival, Jesus home at last! Then when he finally gets home his brother Jurek (Jerzy Stuhr) greets him with the words, Jesus! Youre home, quickly followed up by Too bad you missed Christmas. Then later when the Polish mafia pay Karol a morning visit and threaten to kill him for beating them to buying land, he tells them that he has made a will in which everything gets left to the Church to which their response is, Jesus..to the ChurchWere screwed. The sequence that cements this Christ allegory for me is when Karol wakes up after spending the night in the house he has just bought. He looks at a picture on the wall which is of the Virgin Mary and Child. The picture is for a fraction of a second in clear focus before blurring to focus on Karols reflected face as he combs his hair back in a way that parallels Christ with his rebirth (his resurrection) as a nouveax riche entrepreneur who is now set to practice (and perpetuate) a new religion espousing equality, that is the religion of capitalism which looks set to put Poland on equal terms with the rich West European countries. Of course capitalism is all about men wanting to be more equal than other men which ties in very closely to Kielowskis sardonic view of equality. We notice that Karol invites his Paris savior Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos) to run the company for him at Christmas time. Mikolaj has a Christmas tree on the roof of his car and presents in his arms as he is propositioned by the new look Karol who in addition to having slicked back hair also drives a burgundy red company car. The emphasis is very much on fraternity offered on the birth of a new venture/religion at the most appropriate time of the year  Happy Christmas! are Karols parting words to his benefactor.

Central to Karols enacting of lex talionis (and also adding to the Christ allegory) is his resurrection. In fact the film depicts two resurrections. They both take place underground in entombed circumstances replete with angelic pigeons fluttering around. The first happens in Paris and has a destitute Karol living off making music from his comb (an ironic reference to his trade as a barber) on the ground of the Paris Metro. He is offered a return to life by the fellow ex-pat Pole Mikolaj who agrees to take him back to Poland in his suitcase in return for Karol killing someone. It turns out in Warsaw that this someone is Mikolaj himself so in effect in Paris both men are dead. They do a deal to resurrect each other. Karol is taken back to Poland and his resurrection is kick-started by the two things he receives that night on the Paris Metro with Mikolaj. The first is a 2-franc coin which he demands from a Metro employee after his phone call humiliation at the hands of Dominique and the second is a bust of Marianne, the symbolic figure of liberty and of the French Republic itself. In fact Marianne appears on the reverse side of the 2-franc coin as well. Clearly his resurrection is achieved by following through two desires symbolized by these objects  to make money to put himself on an equal footing with Dominique (on throwing the coin into a river he discovers that money literally sticks to him) and to win her back physically through love. We notice that the bust of Marianne becomes Dominique for him and perhaps we should read Marianne/Dominique as representing all three ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity which had been robbed from him in the Paris law court at the beginning and which he will retrieve by the films closure. The second resurrection on the Warsaw subway has an even greater Biblical air about it as Karol descends the stairs to those spooky white lights typical of Kielowski (we last saw them play on Julies face near the beginning of Blue) and the ethereal fluttering of pigeons. Unlike in Paris Karol is very much alive here as he meets his victim Mikolaj who is dead in spirit. In firing a blank he performs a miracle (emphasized through slow motion) by bringing Mikolaj back to life in the manner of Jesus reviving Lazarus. Possibly the most ecstatic moment of the film has the two fooling around on a frozen river in celebration of their new-found equality as resurrected souls. Here the picture is completely white (the river, the sky, the snow on the ground) as the two figures cavort with each other as drunken black silhouettes. To cap off all the Biblical references (at least the ones I have ferretted out  there are probably a lot more which would be more obvious to Polish people familiar with their strain of Catholicism) as well as playing Lazarus Mikolaj also plays Judas at the end. As Jesus instructs Judas to betray him in the Bible so Karol instructs Mikolaj to make the phone call to the police and nail his disappearance and Dominiques responsibility for it.

Placed in the context of Blue and Red we also see that those films feature resurrection as Julie, both judges and Valentine are all dragged back from the dead in one form or another. Karols dark hair (highlighted by his profession) sits neatly beside that of the two saints in the outer films (Julie and Valentine) and offsets the blond hair of the less than Holy characters whose behavior both causes and relieves the central crises our main protagonists face. In Blue it is the discovery of Sandrines affair that humiliates Julie but also drags her back to life. In Red it is Judge Josephs fixing up of Karin with a new boyfriend at a trial he has called that sets the young judge Auguste free and on course to meet the rootless and lonely Valentine in the aftermath of the ferry disaster. In White of course it is Dominiques bitchy initial behavior that kick starts Karols desire for equality through resurrection and it is her tears shed at his funeral which ensures Karol does eventually turn the other cheek and engineer a complete reconciliation which we don't see fully until the end of Red.

The visual treatment of all three films is remarkable and it has been remarked that both Blue and Red are noticeably plusher than White, the dominating blues and reds of the former standing out more with the latter seeming to be altogether more pallid and less sophisticated. Edward Kosiski had a tougher time in White as the colour is notoriously difficult to photograph. In fact it is not even a colour, Kielowski observing that its more a non-colour. White is however extremely accomplished visually in my book and as in Blue and Red its fascinating to observe how the three colours in question are combined to suggest different ideas. Of course the film is very white with both blue and red given minor but fascinating roles. Indeed, to highlight the whiteness (suggesting mainly Karols obsession with seeking equality with Dominique) black is accentuated both visually and in the script which works as a dead pan black comedy. In the opening 20 minute section the colour scheme is much the same as Blue with all three colours appearing at the same time. We notice most of all perhaps the car park of the law courts with its mixture of red, white and blue cars. Karols loss of liberty is expressed by the loss of his credit card (coloured blue of course). When he and Dominique meet in court both are wearing burgundy red sweaters (they are not divorced yet) and this is echoed later in Poland when the resurrected Karol drives a burgundy red Volvo to express fraternity of a company kind. The severe black and white compositions especially of the first scene after Karols escape from the suitcase and the celebration on the river between the two resurrected souls (the sky is always white in this film) highlights the inequality which he is setting about correcting. He does so through a combination of self-help and the fraternal help of others. The deal with Mikolaj is subtly expressed through coloured scarves. When Mikolaj offers to help the destitute Karol he is wearing a red scarf (he is offering fraternity), but when he meets Karol later to gain his liberty, his scarf is blue. Also offering fraternity is Jurek whose neon sign above his barber shop is noticeably both red and white (the fraternity of brothers who are now equal), but the films dominant black and white highlights Kielowskis concern with the get rich quick materialism that swept Poland in the aftermath of the end of Communism, everyone wanting extra-equality with Polands new European friends as well as each other. The colour white literally blinds us on three occasions  twice on a repetition of a flashback (which could also be a flash-forward) to Karols wedding to Dominique where they are equal before the Lord and once when Karol finally succeeds in bringing Dominique to orgasm. But this equality is both brief and illusory, the ideal proving to be as impossible to achieve as liberty was in Blue and fraternity will be in Red.

I have focused on White as a visualization of lex talionis and as a Biblical allegory mainly because most people have accused it of being too light and inconsequential when set between Blue and Red. This is the risk a filmmaker runs when he dares to make a comedy, even a sardonic black comedy like this one and Im sure Kielowski was well aware of this when he was making it. Of course if the humour suits your taste the film works wonderfully well as a comedy very much along the same lines as Dekalog 10 which also saw Zamachowski and Stuhr playing brothers. I love the opening 15 minute humiliation of Karol, the poor guy facing humiliation after humiliation to such an extent that we can only laugh  the bird defecating on his shoulder, the pathetic way he is left on the court steps by his icy ex-wife (that reptilian wave), the expression on his face as the bank teller cuts up his card, the busking scene where he meets Mikolaj (Your flys undone) and the way we follow him in the suitcase as it teeters perilously close to falling off a luggage truck  la the ending of Stanley Kubricks The Killing. In Poland the comedy continues mainly in the comic duo between brothers, Jerzys efforts to get Karol to cut the hair of ladies who no longer want his services and then Karols sudden kiss of Jerzy which elucidates a hilarious reaction. The jet black comic situations centering around death, buying a corpse, faking a death, the idiocy of Polish peasants (the guy who dreams of burying his newly gained money), launching a probably illegal import-export business, and so on are all spiced up with Zbigniew Preisners music (the delightful lop-sided tango especially noteworthy) and ensure that we remain thoroughly engaged throughout. There are also several delicious performances to really savor. Apart from Zamachowskis absolutely brilliant central turn which bears comparison with Juliette Binoches performance in Blue there is Stuhrs big-hearted brother and Gajos haunted Mikolaj which is every bit as nuanced as the father he played in Dekalog 4. Julie Delpy has a very unsympathetic role which she carries off well. Without the final sign language declaration of love from behind the bars she would be a complete monster and the film may indeed be as misogynistic as some have claimed it to be. As it is Kielowski gets away with it, but only just.

This last scene was a late addition shot separately in a Paris studio and points to the only problem I see with this film. As tidily as the legal locations book-end the narrative and as clearly as the progress of lex talionis is rendered, the ending requires some swallowing for it rests on several implausibilities. How is it Dominiques passport shows she was in Warsaw the day of Karols death? Karols death certificate is procured before Mikolaj calls Dominique to come for the funeral. Karol observes his own funeral and then that night presents himself to Dominique in her room. The next morning he disappears and the police end up at her door thanks to Mikolajs phone call. We hear that Karol is supposed to be in the air en-route to Hong Kong, but instead we are shown him saying goodbye to Jerzy and being sent off with a blue shopping bag. This man doesnt look like hes going on a long trip. He is then let into a prison that evening (how does he manage this exactly? Prisons just don't open like that) to find Dominique presenting herself conveniently at her cell window for her to mime her love. This is all very unlikely and shows the director wanting to tie the ends of his film together poetically rather than realistically. He wants the prison finish to mirror the law court opening and he wants the crying through a window scene to tally with the way both Blue and Red end. The presentation is very elliptical and we are unsure how much time passes though Jerzys talk of identifying the corpse does suggest that everything is happening very quickly within just a couple of days. As it stands the film suggests Karol does turn the other cheek by softening his attitude, by not going to Hong Kong, by not giving up his name. The possibility of true equality between him and Dominique is left there, and possibly cemented at the closure of Red, but within the span of this film, true equality is shown only fleetingly in the two flashbacks/flash-forwards to their wedding (as seen by both of them individually) and in the brief moment of orgasm in the hotel room. This has been cleverly built up by two flash-forwards as Karol earlier decides his plan to a girl opening a door and crossing a room which we only later realize is of Dominique at the moment Karol sees her from her bed. The film feels like it has reached its completion and arguably we should simply give in to the poetry after the brilliance of so much of what has passed before. The ending shouldnt be so overwhelmingly moving, but the fact that it is bears tribute to Kielowskis considerable skill at accessing the inner lives of his protagonists and reaching the spirit through poetic means entirely his own.",1466380800,,22661,4.7285605868960285
7843450,4,6303326838,"Is there a bit of sexist snark at the bottom of ""White,"" the middle movie of Kieslowski's ""Three Colors"" trilogy?  When a man can't perform his marital duties, so to speak, and the woman takes charge (or tries to), nobody's happy.  But if the man can recover his get-up-and-go, then all might yet be well.  So it seems in ""White"" -- though the circumstances of that ""wellness"" at the movie's close are ironic, to say the least.  How we are intended to process that irony (if indeed we are) isn't entirely clear.  Is it a problem with the movie that the direction of the irony isn't clear?  I tend to think not, if for no other reason than that the movie is clear in other ways and is also absorbing to watch.  Most importantly, the story is clear:  Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski) is the disappointing husband, in Paris, with his wife, Dominique (Julie Delpy), who is in the process of divorcing him, for non-consummation of marriage, as the movie opens.  In some sense, it could be said that they still love another, but to no avail, and Karol returns to Poland, in a marvelous comic scene, with the help of Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), another Pole whom he meets is a Paris subway and who offers to pay him to kill a man who wants to die but can't bring himself to commit suicide.  Back in Poland, Karol finds a very different economic climate from the one he left -- Communism has fallen, and Poland is ""Europe"" now, which means that it's an economic free fire zone.  (Need a dead body? No problem -- we can get one shipped from Russia!).  On meeting up with Mikolaj, we learn that the man who wanted to die was Mikolaj himself.  The scene in which the contract is met is richly comic, mainly because Mikolaj changes his mind, and he and Karol go into business very successfully.  Zamachowski's performance as the new, confident Karol, bustling to prosperity in the wild West of the new Polish economy is quite marvelous.  He now wants Dominique back and constructs a bizarre plan to win her -- about which I'll say no more, just in case any readers haven't seen the movie.

The question about irony that I raised earlier might be rephrased as a question about whether the movie is a kind of parable -- but if so, of what?  Of the relation between economic success and sexual success? Or is it a political parable about old and new economic forces in Europe?  The ending is a surprise, and that's what raised my original question about sexist snark, but it seems to me at least as likely that Kieslowski has chosen a dated, cliched vision of sexual relationships on which to hang a story that is more of a satire on a notion of freedom that can thrive in an economy open to capitalism for the first time in decades.  Fetishism and commodification thrive in such an atmosphere, and the dated cliches of love are what perhaps work to make that comically and a bit painfully clear to us.  So -- well worth seeing, definitely not boring.  My sense of what the film is pointing to might be totally wrong, but it'll puzzle you into coming up with an account of why it seems, for all its oddness, to make sense.",1457827200,,3105,4.469858156028369

7843452,3,6303326838,"White is about a jealous husband seeking revenge on his wife by getting her to love him. The irony is that he succeeds in getting her love but the act of getting revenge ruins their chance of a life together as she's thrown in prison.

Structurally the story is a bit loose, the revenge plot goes from success to success with no real obstacles while the love relationship also doesn't have many meaningful changes. It feels like the storytellers wanted to really focus on the irony of love/revenge at the end of the film that the journey getting there wasn't fleshed out in a meaningful way. The result is an enjoyable film but not a great film that will likely not warrant a second viewing because the controlling idea is not powerfully proven.

The additional sub-plot of the friend seeking suicide because he is bored also does not resonate with the controlling idea much. The film is well shot and composed, but the controlling idea is certainly not proven.

After the uplift of Blue this film is very deadpan,sardonic and edgy with its predominant character Karol's(Charlie after Chaplin)need to overcome impotence,language barriers(Dominique his wife is French,he's Polish) and divorce while still in love with Dominique(Delphy).White stands in the tricolour for personal and political equality. We get flashbacks to the wedding scene with Dominique emerging from Church dressed in white and the pigeons all flying up,we also get some very snowy landscapes in Karol's native Poland,there's also an alabaster figure which reminds him of Dominique,which gets chipped and broken. The couple are estranged and apart and we get to see little of Delphy as a character as this is more about the effects she has on Karol's life. Karol is a hairdresser and gets back to Poland in a suitcase with the help of Mikolaj(Gajos),a man who offers him a job to put an end to a would-be suicide's life. Karol transforms himself from destitute to powerful yet warm-hearted: his aim to get Domique back as in get back together with her and to get even with her. He reawakens Dominique's love through a cunning scheme. Kieslowski lays bare the impoverished ethics of the new money-obsessed Poland and also suggests one can never go back. This is a cruel film whose coolness yet harbours some embers of humanity and a lyrical admission of the power of love. Zamochowski is brilliant. Preisner's score is superb.
