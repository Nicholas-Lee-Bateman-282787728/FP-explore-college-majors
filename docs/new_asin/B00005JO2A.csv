What do you do when you're a no budget horror director on the skids with nowhere left to go to get your movies made? You go Porn. Hairy hairy 70s porn that is.
  But since you're Ed you can't resist throwing in skull breast feeding, bela legosi name dropping, sex witches, and stuffed wolf mummies. Oh and don't forget the coffin sex, the male non-consensual coffin sex. It's generally pretty entertaining as long as you're not expecting much and have had some nachos and beer to go along with it.
  Be prepared for way too long, badly shot, sex scenes. Lots of them, like most of the film. The actors are pretty normal looking too, no real winners, just sinners with Austin powers level hair everywhere.
Dare you to chug a beer every time the main girl berates the main guy for not getting a boner!",1425081600,,900,4.4363636363636365

That being said, the movie is exactly as advertised - Ed Wood soft porn.  You know you're on familiar territory when the ""actors"" begin our little romp with references to Bela Legosi.

Is there a plot worth reviewing in a movie like this?  Well... is there EVER in an Ed Wood film?  You don't watch a movie like this for the quality, the acting, the writing or... *Especially* the porn.  You watch it because Ed is so lovingly bad, and so thoroughly consistant, it's like spending time with an old, slightly insane friend.  All the standard props are here - undead, slightly dead, mostly dead (and an almost erotic lesbian scene).  But in the end one star is all it gets, and is probably more than it deserves.  Which would probably thrill Ed.  ""One star?  GREAT!  I'll get 1 1/2 next time!""  Gotta love Ed.",1110672000,,948,4.337142857142857
