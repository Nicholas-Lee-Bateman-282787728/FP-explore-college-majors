8727388,4,B013EXPKL8,"This is NOT a mindless, slasher movie, gore fest. What it is, though, is a crime story that unfolds in front of you like those written by James M Cain without the gratuitous sex and twisted lust motivated  violence. In other words, like the old E C Comics such as Shocking Suspense Stories ran, it is a morality tale. Will the girl have the guts to stand up to the pressure put on her by her sorority sisters? Her sorority initiation is to seduce a nerd of their choosing. Then get him to come to her room. They will do the rest. Against her better judgement she agrees. The senseless prank ends in his death. To keep her silent, they give her the royal treatment. They also frame her. What will she do? Will she enjoy the benefits and keep quite or do the right thing? Is it even possible for her to do the right thing were she so motivated?

Some will say this is a trite hackneyed flick with little imagination that mounts a soap box and thunders a moral message. Could be. Some will say it is formulaic and telegraphs the ending....not entirely true... you might see where the plot is going but you won't know how it gets there. Cheesy? Yes but in an entertaining way. I loved it.",1477958400,,1184,4.304932735426009
8727389,2,B013EXPKL8,"Natalie (Katelyn Tarver) is a mature senior headed off to college to be an architect like her deceased mother. She is a legacy at the Delta Psi Beta sorority and is heavily recruited as we see her as being ""bait"" for a plan by Alexa (Tamara Duarte) the head of the group and a cleavage showing senator's daughter. In order to get into the group, Natalie must seduce a person of Alexa's choosing. When the guy (Noam Jenkins) dies from a prank, the sorority clams up over the whole incident and provides themselves with their own alibis. Natalie has to deal with a case of the guilts. Alexa is over-the-top vindictive and manipulative.

The film isn't as sexy as the cover and there is never a hot blonde with a knife. The death is by a car accident. This is NOT a slasher film in spite of the billing. It is a college drama with a made-for-TV quality to it. The girls in the film are all pretty with short skirts, but there is no sex or nudity. I don't recall any swearing in the film. Even the sex talk was very PG. More like a Lifetime film than anything else.

The English title is ""Dead on Campus."" The film is in English. There are 2 text messages in German.",1449878400,,1162,4.277272727272727
