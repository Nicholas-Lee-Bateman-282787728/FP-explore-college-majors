It is everything you would hope from the Met, which incidentally was founded in New York City only 9 years after Aida's premiere, and which is the largest and presumably wealthiest classical music organization in North America.  My only criticism of the visual aspect, as beautiful as it is, is that back when ancient Egypt was just Egypt, it didn't look ancient.  The scenery artists have given us an Egypt of the present day museum, with crumbling stonework and, except in one scene, faded paintings and broken statuary.  It's probably true to the productions Verdi knew, and the characters manage not to be overwhelmed by the scenery, but it's a shame that the vibrant colors and fine stonework of the time couldn't have been re-created on stage.

Aida is not only (arguably) Verdi's most popular opera, but it is perhaps even the most popular opera yet written--and unlikely to be eclipsed in the future.  It tells a story both epic and intimate, a story of power, betrayal, and of emotions that seem less like love than obsession.  The princess Amneris loves the warrior Radames; but he loves Amneris's slave Aida, a captured princess who loves Radames and yet is horrified by his desire to conquer her native land.  And when I say `love', I don't actually mean that word--none of these characters acts in a loving way toward their heart's desire; in fact Radames and Aida can't have had any sort of relationship before the opera starts.  Their mutual longings must simply be fueled by the fact that each thinks the other is hot.  They all end up betraying one another--although Radames, at least, is relatively unwitting in his betrayals--and the end result is that Aida and Radames end up together--entombed to die, while Amneris is filled with regret at her spiteful behaviour.  I'm tempted to suggest that is not because she's sent the object of her heart's desire to his death, but simply because she didn't end up getting what she wanted.  Amneris is not a sympathetic character.  But the music is divine, especially in the final scene, and it's divinely sung by Johan Botha as Radames and Violeta Urmana as Aida.  The closing contains one of the loveliest, most haunting melodies Verdi ever wrote, and soprano Urmana especially does an incredible job.  This production is everything you would expect of the Met, done to the highest standard.  The soloists are superb, the chorus impeccable, and even though it's an opera company, they have one of the finest orchestras in the world.  To make sure their name is associated with only the highest standards, the Met exercises great quality control over its DVD productions in every aspect, including the camerawork, sound quality, and even the extras.  So often useless filler, the extras in this case are a number of very interesting cast interviews done by soprano Rene Fleming.

As I've said, it is everything one could hope for from the Met, but, it's also nothing unexpected or particularly new--this Aida isn't re-interpreted in modern day Egypt amid the turmoil of revolution, for example.  While some would point to the museum-like quality of the production as an irrelevance to modern life, it should be remembered that museums are not just places where relics of the past are stored. No, they are places of wonder, where objects of fascination and beauty are preserved for all to enjoy.  It would be impossible for me to give this DVD anything other than my highest recommendation.  Well, okay, I do have one complaint: there are, alas, no elephants.",1322179200,16,3803,4.872670807453416
