I bought it while I was in his class, because his art form was so impressive.  Now, my children are beginning to practice it with me, and the video really helps.  I have seen other Tai Chi videos and they are great, but they do not move as slowly as he does.  This has two benefits.  First, for the beginner, it makes it easier to learn.  Second, if you practice it more slowly, it has a deeper impact on your muscles and internal organs.  Tai Chi is the most important exercise in my life, because it keeps me balanced mentally and physically.  Try it and you'll never regret it.",1167868800,,696,4.212121212121212

This is one of the best videos on the market for beginners like myself. The colors and location of the video was a real treat. Where is Sifu Kersh located, I would like to take lessons?",977961600,9,353,4.363636363636363
