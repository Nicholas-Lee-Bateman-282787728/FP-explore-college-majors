8706947,5,B00UIF9EYK,"I saw this title on an ""online video"" site.  And it sounded interesting.  THEN, I had second thoughts because I found out I had to read subtitles.  It started off a little slow and I wasn't sure who was going to be the protagonist.  I hung in there and then couldn't walk away.  I'm VERY glad I stuck it out and it was well worth my time.  I'm not going to review it because others have done a fine job, but I'd like to add that the constant music through out the movie was very good and set the mood for the action.",1448668800,,516,3.9611650485436893
8706948,5,B00UIF9EYK,What a truly special film!  Epic naval battle scenes!  Masterfully driven plot.  Excellent direction.  I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen!  Will watch again and again!,1444694400,,174,5.071428571428571
8706949,4,B00UIF9EYK,"A South Korean production that broke records at the South Korean box office, Admiral is obviously a ""feel-good"" movie for Korean viewers since the Japanese get their heads handed to them in a frankly humiliating defeat (the Battle of Myeongnyang).

PROs
 Absolutely beautiful cinematography and costumes/regalia
 The battle scenes look so real that you often can't tell where the sets end and the CGI begins
 Rare insight into Eastern 16th century naval warfare
 History as art; this film has a heart and soul

CONs
 The first half is dragged down by lots of scenes with testosterone-ridden military officers childishly and melodramatically roaring at each other
 Overbearing jingoism muddies the waters; I would have preferred a little less ""Hollywood"" (whatever the Korean equivalent is) and a little more historical accuracy
 The musical score is ambitious, but grandiloquent; constantly clashing cymbals become so overused that their purpose is defeated

Admiral is the kind of movie you're likely to view more than once; I watched it dubbed the first time (to keep focused on the action), but may watch it again with subtitles at some point in the future since you almost get a different film when watching without dub.

8706950,5,B00UIF9EYK,"Right up there with one of the best war pictures I have ever seen. Recommended by a friend and did not expect much at first. Boy was I wrong. Acting is superb, story line, everything about this movie speaks of an all time classic. Amazing. All I can say is thank you to the makers of the film for this gift of cinematic brilliance",1429920000,3,330,4.171875
