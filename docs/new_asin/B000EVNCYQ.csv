THE 1 STAR REVEIWER WHO SAID THIS DOES NOT COME WITH 2 CDS ,MUST HAVE PURCHASED A DIFFERENT SET AND SHOILD BE DISCOUNTED.

2538819,5,B000EVNCYQ,"This title was producded from a TV special shown through out Europe back in 1989. Flim & audio quality is not up the current DVD standards. Two channel sound & low res film. A typical clean production for those old VHS players & analog TV sets. Still, it's a nice clean title that I rate about 9 out of 10 considering it's age. It's a 4:3 video NOT 16:9 flim.

Out of all the video Pink Floyd material, this title is my favorite. No silly effects and no dang interviews. Just the concert. They where in top form and did a super job. Excellent.",1191283200,8,543,4.221153846153846

2538847,5,B000EVNCYQ,I listened to this show in 89's. In VHS era. It's so amazing. Big gig. I recomend it. One of the greatest rock shows.,1376006400,,117,3.9166666666666665
2538848,2,B000EVNCYQ,"The concert is great, but I received 2cds that were identical. There were supposed to be 2 different CDs and a DVD, but when I took the CDs out of their sleeves, they were the same songs.",1372636800,2,187,4.081081081081081
2538849,1,B000EVNCYQ,"The only thing worse than the disjointed camera work is the lighting. The reviews that call it ""subdued"" are being kind. Seeing dark images of the band members from a distance doesn't make any sense when the intent to show the surrounding scenery is lost in shadows. Audio is tolerable at best. And if you can somehow ignore that, there's the fact that David Gilmore, in his quest to replace Roger Waters as the frontman, has given up much of his guitaring to a backup guitarist.  David should have stuck to guitar and gotten a front with a voice and personality.",1358985600,,563,4.574257425742574

2538863,4,B000EVNCYQ,"Any DVD of Pink Floyd in Venice, with a full stage and band floating on the water, is a transfer from VHS.
Some are better than others however and there isn't a way to tell which is which except by the art/DVD covers.

This concert was simulcast across much of Western Europe on TV that night, and as such any recordings available (by the public) are all from VHS.Its reported over 23 million people viewed this concert via TV.

An important note to expectant viewers/purchasers of this concert - since this was being shot with multiple TV cameras,the scrim lighting is very very subdued. They had to tone down the motion of the robot lights and keep them from facing the cameras.
The few times that the lights do flash towards you, the viewer, the spots on your eyes are so bright that you will thank the engineer who realized to do this...
they are really VERY bright on camera and likely the band and crew saw that as a TV broadcast, it just wouldnt work with the show in its full glory.

The set is also condensed, each song is played thru but overall this entire show had to fit in an alotted time so you may notice some songs are not as slow or long as on DSOT. They do all of ShineOn, the full jam in 'Money', the full solos in 'Sorrow' but it still seems a tad short. It is not the entire set as is DSOT and there are no 2 disc sets of this show - this entire concert is a (approx) 1.5 hr concert, so don't expect more songs.

Overall the quality is good, much better than any typical bootleg. The band by this point are very relaxed and play well together, and Big Dave is in high spirits, at one point he can be seen spinning around in a 360 while playing, all the band are smiling, and the music quality of the DVD is basically DSOT.

My copy only has 1 minute of slight discoloration from the start of the VHS tape and any distant/long shots of the band and stage are somewhat dark, as that is how VHS was.
Its night time, you cannot see any detail in the water around the stage when the camera pulls back.
If you see any photos of the show, (bit rare) the water around the entire area is full of boats and people and twinkling lights. In this DVD from the far rear camera views it looks like the whole stage is floating on black space - essentially you caannot make anything out on the water, but these views are very very short and do not detract at all from the concert.

Overall the atmosphere is great and the show is shot fairly close up - all the concert is shot from the point of view of stage left, stage right, and from all across the front of the stage.

The sound is pretty good, and if you made this an audio CD and pumped up the bass and mids a bit, it would sound better than any MLOR tour bootlegs that are out there(...i have a few believe me...) This sounds good enough to play loud, probably most people would confuse it with DSOT.
Overall a nice transfer to DVD and personal time machine to Pink Floyd, playing live on their full stage, floating on the water in Venice in July of 1989.",1309392000,9,3017,4.182444061962134

you can see the with lines on the bottom of the screen, like if you need to fix the tracking on the VHS.
With no doubt about it you will buy a VHS quality.
Also you can see some mistakes with the audio; e.i. the song Money, the saxophone solo is mute for about 10 sec.
And you can hear that the first girl in the Great gig in the sky is having a hard time reaching the notes
and David Gilmour didn't start on Wish you were here jejeje he missed ... SO .... he start with
So you think you can tell
This video is the opposite of Delicate sound of thunder, great video, looks like a movie, great camera work
