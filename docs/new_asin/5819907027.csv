7802646,5,5819907027,"What an absolutely refreshing ""joy"" this KSeries turns out to be.  If you've watched 'typical' KRomComDramas, you know what to expect...fairly formulaic; not this one, though!  From start to finish,the most handsome and talented lead-actor, Mr. So Ji-sub, both picks up and sets the pace for this jewel of a story that keeps unfolding and never slows down.  Ji-sub plays the character, ""Kim Young-ho,"" while the vibrant and charming actress, Shin Min-ah, (unknowingly suffering from an un-diagnosed thyroid disorder) portrays a once famous 'beauty,'  named ""Kang Joo-eun"".  When this 'lady- lawyer' and 'mystery man' meet, their lives are never the same, and eventually, both think that, (in a good way). I will mention Ep. 12:  have kleenex!  This is happily the only place you'll need them (and I mean REALLY need them)!  ""Oh My Venus"", however, has so many bright and shining moments that I can't remember laughing and smiling more, or feeling happier or more excited than I have with this huge winner of a series.  Don't miss this!",1475107200,,1035,5.041176470588235
