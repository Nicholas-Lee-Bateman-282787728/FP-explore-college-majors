8558895,5,B00AXKIN0G,KOREAN TOP GUN.  The is a good show.  Many funny moments.  Real world politics has many sides to everything.  This is art imitating on version of life.  In light of the trouble and challenges between North and South Korea.  I personally wish that this kind of thing will not happen but each day real world news shows that it just might.  For now if you want to watch a fun action pack military movie you just might like this one.,1452643200,,429,4.2875
8558896,5,B00AXKIN0G,"This movie seemed more like  commercial for the military.  It was well done with beautiful scenes and the acting was realistic.  I enjoyed it very much.  I even went to see the movie at the 309 Cinema in Pa last year.  Rain is an excellent actor and takes his roles very seriously.  I hope he makes for Hollywood, not just his country.  He hasn't hit it big in the USA yet.  I think that is because of miscommunication in 2007 when he could not perform in Hawaii and whoever is managing his career now, just doesn't know how to win the hearts of the American people.  He always has the adoration of his 50000 plus fans.  Hopefully, he will succeed in the USA.  We need our heroes.  Also buy Ninja Assassin staring Rain.",1412726400,2,719,4.323308270676692

Since the dvd was coming from across the planet, I don't blame the seller for the lost dvd, and would order from this seller again.",1376870400,,357,4.343283582089552
