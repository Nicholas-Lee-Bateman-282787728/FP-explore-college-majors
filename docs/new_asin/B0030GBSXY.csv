8385844,1,B0030GBSXY,"I was hoping for a lesbian movie about real lesbians. Instead this movie (directed by a man. Written by him and another woman with the same last name, his wife? (Really?)  Was full of racist stereotypes, lesbian stereotypes, even the straight men were stereotyped.  And it was boring.  What a disappointment.",1446336000,,308,5.0
8385845,3,B0030GBSXY,"Overall, Flick's Chicks is a low-budget film that honestly wasn't shot particularly well. Most of the dialogue is weak, including a pointless argument between two women on Brazil and global warming. Fortunately the tepid writing is partly redeemed with a great monologue by Brazilian actress Jackeline Olivier as the film approaches its conclusion.

I was disappointed by the plot, which makes little sense. Flick, in her search for true love, decides to find it by inviting five complete strangers over for the weekend. Not only is the premise flawed, but the movie isn't remotely as funny as it could have been. It has its comedic moments, but the only standout one in the film is the dinner scene with Flick's parents and her invited guests.

For this only being her second film, I thought the lovely Evelyn Gaynor (as lead character Flick) offered a nice performance. She projected a genuine sense of being nervous throughout the movie, and has an expressive face that capably reflects her voiceovers.

The majority of the cast is also inexperienced in film, though I did enjoy what some of the actresses brought to the table. One of my favorite aspects of the casting was the extremely sexy Cara Castronova as feisty Marissa. Castronova's actually a two-time Golden Gloves champ, so it was interesting to see an aggressive character played by a legit tough-as-nails boxer.

Flick's Chicks does come off fairly anti-man, as the majority of the male characters (even through anecdotes) are presented in a negative light. But as a straight man, I also have to concede that I've known guys who were like some of the characters in the film.

I thought all of the actresses in the cast were gorgeous, and really enjoyed Debra Austin Toscano's funny performance as Flick's mother Ruthie. Otherwise, Flick's Chicks really brought nothing new to the table. It wasn't especially funny, nor was the plot very interesting. ""The L Word"" it's not, I'd say watch it once before deciding to buy the DVD.",1270339200,,1992,4.934328358208956
