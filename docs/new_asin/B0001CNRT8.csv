8010181,1,B0001CNRT8,"This DVD set with Jackie Chan's name all over it does not feature Jackie Chan.  The first disc is a documentary about martial arts actors with some stuff about Jackie for about five minutes. It is ok if you like a PBS style documentary about actors.
The second disc is called Jackie Chan's Second strike, but he is not in it at all.  You might like the movie, but again if you bought it because of Jackie Chan on the cover, it is disappointing and I think even misleading.  I bought the thing to see Jackie Chan and was very disappointed.  There are some pretty good fight scenes and the lead bad woman cop is pretty good.",1082592000,4,622,4.2905982905982905
