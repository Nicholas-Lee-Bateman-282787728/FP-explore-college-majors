432185,5,6302150949,"One of my all time favorite B movies from the 80's. Not even given close to the recognition it deserves, this film is one of the absolute best cheap ass sci-fi movies out there. I too cannot wait for this to show up on DVD and quite frankly I'm shocked that isn't even being discussed to my knowledge. In the same genre..Killer Klowns from Outer Space made it to DVD..I truly can't see why this one cannot. I picked this film up at a local video store back in 1988 and just fell in love with it. Sure it's cheesy..but hey..if you are true B movie fan..then this one is for you. 3 thumbs up! I own the typical VHS version of this film and I'm crossing my fingers for a DVD sometime in the near future.",1095638400,15,700,4.116788321167883

7821872,4,6302150949,"Based on the success of  ROCKY and STAR WARS it was decided to combine the two films in a bad campy way. Steve Armstrong (Paul Satterfield) has a Hollywood fight name so he is a fighter when he is not a cook. He was a boxer on Earth, and left to box in the Arena, but doesn't want to to when given a chance because boxing in outer space is crooked. His best friend is Shorty (Hamilton Camp) a Nebulite with 4 hands and Hobbit like qualities. He is managed by Quinn (Claudia Christian) but has eyes for the evil Jade (Shari Shattuck) who is also a singer and dancer.

Follow the formula...

This was campy and cheesy. The arena fights were a laugh. 4 stars for a campy production. Available on a DVD 4 pack.",1443398400,,706,4.176470588235294

7821875,4,6302150949,"A futuristic tale, conflict is resolved in the Arena (a galactic fighting tournament) between humans and alien creatures.

Its nothing more than a film of cheap amusement, kind of like a fighting show for bored adults: when you take it for what it is, it actually provides a good deal of low budget Sci-Fi satisfaction.

It's got a bunch of no name actors for the most part, but they manage to get the job done. The effects weren't all that bad, but try to overlook the acting.

Not a bad Sci-Fi, low budget B movie.",1383177600,,516,4.410526315789474

This movie was in great condition and we enjoyed it. Thank you.",1349049600,,137,3.7586206896551726
7821877,5,6302150949,"I am predisposed to liking cheesy sci-fi movies. Ever since I was a kid I have watched stuff like Godzilla, Buck Rogers, etc.

This movie is actually halfway decent. Especially if you are ready to have a laugh at the corny bits.

I only keep a handful of VHS these days, and don't drag the VCR out often. Arena is one of those movies I will plug in the VCR for.

Buy a copy while you still can!",1336867200,,394,4.0256410256410255
7821878,3,6302150949,"When I first became aware of this film's existence, I was excited. Space aliens contending against humans in organized ring fighting? - how could this not be a cult classic, I wondered. Well, I found out: while a concept like this would ideally play out as a combination of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars/dp/B00003CXCT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport/dp/B00006RCOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport</a>, it's really nothing more than a typical B-movie with a few inspired perks. There's enough heart in the film for lenient viewers to enjoy, but it disappoints as an action flick and therein proves why it never made it to Region 1 DVD (until recently, though as part of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/marathon-collection/dp/B00C7A8WZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">marathon collection</a>).

The story: on an intergalactic space station, out-of-work Steve Armstrong (Paul Satterfield, ""One Life to Live"") becomes the first viable human contender in the inter-species Arena fighting ralley in fifty years. En-route to his championship match against the cybernetic Horn (Michael Deak,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Turbo-A-Power-Rangers-Movie/dp/B00009WVSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie</a>), he's obstructed by the crime lord Rogor (Mark Alaimo,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Deep-Space-Nine/dp/B00062RCC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a>) who's desperate to hold onto his control over the circuit through his alien champion.

While the movie tries and (partially) fails to create a believable world contained on a space vessel, it achieves at least some fun sights due to the work of special effects artist/alien designer Steve Wang (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Guyver/dp/B0002A2VLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Guyver</a>). Some alien costumes are better than others and a couple simply look like oversized masks stuffed on the heads of human performers, but others are pretty creative and fun to watch lumber around, like the long-legged insect-centaur creature that Steve fights in his first official match. Human performers are hit & miss, including Claudia Christian (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Babylon-5/dp/B002DUJ9Q6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Babylon 5</a>) and Shari Shattuck (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Deadly-Ground/dp/0790740826/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Deadly Ground</a>) as respective good-bad girls, but I'm overall displeased with the casting of Paul Satterfield. He's tall and has some muscle tone, but he looks more like a misplaced basketball player than a boxer or a wrestler, and it really doesn't help that he's been outfitted with an incredibly embarrassing costume for his fight scenes.

Oh yeah, the fight scenes. They're not so great, either, and sadly this is because of a major flaw in the whole concept of this movie: people in bulky monster suits do not make great fighters. They apparently cannot be filmed very well either, since with the exception of the final showdown, we rarely get a wide view of Steve and his opponent trading barbs, instead needing to settle for a multitude of close-ups and reaction shots. The fighting itself is almost all boxing, with a bit of light wrestling moves thrown in, so it's not very interesting to watch. Meh.

One thing the film doesn't do and which I'm pleased of is present humans as a conquered species or let the aliens have any kind of autonomy over them; that's been overdone enough. Also, Shari Shattuck sings, which hadn't happened before or since, but she's good enough to make me wish she had. Beyond that, the film's pretty flat and unlikely to deliver any thrills, but it's not bad enough to deserve a lower rating. It's my theory that there are a few people out there for whom this movie would fill an obscure niche, so all I can say is if the film sounds interesting to you and you think you can overlook the described flaws, have at it.",1331164800,,4320,6.534031413612565
7821879,3,6302150949,"ARENA wages a battle beyond the stars, where warriors from across the galaxy compete in hand-to-hand combat in an intergalactic coliseum! Now, a human fighter must enter the competition in order to overthrow the corrupted system and earn the prize money he needs to return home to Earth. Paul Satterfield stars as Steve Armstrong in this ambitious and highly entertaining Sci-Fi adventure from Empire Pictures. ARENA features an array of incredible creatures and impressive set designs that are every bit as imaginative as the ones found in the STAR WARS series, with a surprisingly grand scale considering the size of the production. Like Rocky before him, Steve must train hard and earn the audience's respect in this underdog tale if he hopes to become the first human champion to win the event in over 50 years. The budgetary constraints result in a great deal of filler in between fights, but the excitement in the ring is worth the wait. B-movie fans that are looking for plenty of alien action and Space Age fun, the ARENA awaits you!

Street Fighters</a>&nbsp;Sid stumbled upon fantastic b gold yet again. The very same channel offered up a fine dose of Sci-fi b from 1988 called Arena. After hitting the info button we knew this one had to be unreal just from the 2 sentence synopsis. Usually we wind up more in the action or horror B genre but have always welcomed a Science fiction entry, especially once we saw it was produced by Charles Band prior to him launching Full Moon. If that wasn't enough we then realized the main character looked very familiar and found out it was the Deke from Creepshow 2! Hey Pancho! That's one of Sid's favorites and will go down as once of the greatest spots yet to date.

In Arena we find ourselves somewhere far into the future, despite it's got 80's written all over it, where elite fighters from every planet battle in the ring in hopes of becoming the B champion of the universe. For a quite some time no earthling had been good enough to be a contender until Creepshow 2 Alumni Steve Armstrong comes along. He winds up getting himself into a mess and has to take on only the best and cheaply made alien creatures or an alien mafiosa will have to take him out. He becomes an underdog on the rise, much like Rocky Balboa, only with far less of a budget and an insane amount of more laughs.

Arena was easily a 5 star event from premise and budget alone. This is one of those gems that is so cheaply made and hilariously acted that you have no choice but to love it. That is unless you're some stuffy overly serious movie watcher that can't find the beauty in a great piece of B cinema. As long as you're going into it with the right expectations you will freaking love it. We suggest you get some of your favorite munchies, a nice substance of choice, and sit back for an hour an a half of laughs coupled with WTF moments. And don't forget to really take in the award winning performance by mighty Earthling warlord Steve Armstrong, or as we like to remember him as Pancho.",1265932800,2,2167,4.73015873015873
