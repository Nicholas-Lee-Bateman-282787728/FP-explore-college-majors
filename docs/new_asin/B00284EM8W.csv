8355811,4,B00284EM8W,very good and informational. It isn't a great one but it isn't all about sunken ships that is just how it starts. The ships are discussed as artificial reefs. Worth the $10,1406073600,,172,4.40625
8355812,3,B00284EM8W,We were expecting more of a documentary-type show with more underwater footage and water-life.  It is interesting but not into stories of ships going down in the deep and so forth.,1395014400,,180,4.806451612903226
