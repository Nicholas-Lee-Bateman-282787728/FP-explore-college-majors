7888257,1,6305371741,"The reviews that identify this film as ""South Shaolin Master"" are incorrect. ""Red Dragon of Shaolin"" is actually a Taiwanese film called ""Little Hero of Shaolin."" It's a horrible movie with bad dubbing and terrible choreography. Don't get this thinking you'll get a movie of any quality. The second movie, Legend of the Tiger (aka Tiger Love) starring Stephen Tung is terrible a well. A poor martial arts flick that turns into an awful ghost story with a marauding tiger. Avoid this entire disc.",1230336000,2,495,4.904761904761905
