3709276,5,B001N3BD04,"This is such a cool video! It features 2 live action Mario Bros. comedy scenes, and 1 Mario animated cartoon. The 1st live action is where Mario gets hit on the head, and the 2nd with their cousins who fall in love with the Mario Bros. guest. The animated show has Mario and the others looking for Aladin's lamp. This is a great show, not just because it's based on the games, but it's very entertaining. For all true Nintendo fans, it's a must-have!",1026777600,,450,4.369047619047619

8323022,4,B001N3BD04,Recommend this DVD for any kid growing remembering the classic Nintendo/Super Nintendo games based on these shows. I am more of a fan of the Adventures Of Super Mario Bros. 3 shows. You can see the whole episode of Super Koopa without the blank bloops from the Complete Series DVD.,1401494400,,281,4.64

8323024,5,B001N3BD04,My grandson thoroughly enjoyed it.  Personally I am not a Mario fan but if the delight my grandson expressed is worth anything then this product should be rated a 5.,1376784000,,165,4.5
