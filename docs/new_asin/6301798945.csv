367671,5,6301798945,"This version of the Long Hot Summer is an excellent adaption of the earlier movie with Paul Newman and JoAnne Woodward.  Don Johnson is perfectly cast as Ben Quick and James Gammon is appropriately smarmy as his dad.  Cybill Shepard, William Russ, Jason Robards, Judith Ivey, and Ava Gardner are also well cast in their roles.  You start to sweat right along with the characters as their relationships heat up.  Don Johnson just oozes sex appeal in every scene.  It is easy to get lost in their portrayals, you will want to order a mint julep and sit on the veranda before the night is over!",991267200,25,591,4.537735849056604
367672,5,6301798945,"Being a humongous Don Johnson fan I will be byass by saying first that I saw the original with Paul Newman and wife Joanne Woodward. I enjoyed that very, very much. It was very charming dramatic and sexy. Oh my god was Newman a hunk. So Don really got me heated up by giving an equally sexy portrayal of Ben Quick, more modern of course, with tension, heat. It was very 80's with the love scenes outside with Ivey. Hell as sexy as he looked and carried himself I would've been in the grass with him bugs and all. Okay now maybe that wasn't as byass as the rest. But is still classy, charming, sexy and very dramatic. I think Ivey was a good match. We don't always have to find a supermodel Pamela Anderson looking woman. She's is more attractive to him because she was the exact opposite of him. Shepard's character is more whom he probably would link with but it worked with Ivey because of the constant conflicts and pent up tension between the two. As without saying Mr. Robards was excellent in every scene as I expected to see.",986342400,11,1032,4.352331606217617
367673,5,6301798945,"I happened to catch this movie on TV and fortunately for me, taped it.  I loved the scenes between Judith Ivey & Don Johnson - in the store & by the river - best love scene I have EVER seen.  The scenes between Jason Robbards & Don Johnson makes you feel like you are listening at the door on the veranda. The music is wonderful, different, haunting and adds so much - the direction and shots and the passion - they're all there. I watch this movie once a summer - when it is very hot out.  Wish I could see it on the BIG screen.",981936000,24,529,3.9716981132075473

367745,5,6301798945,This was the best of the two versions of the Movie The Long Hot Summer. Don Johnson is far superior to Paul Newman and Judith Ivey is better than Joanne Woodward. The only better actor is Orson Wells as Big Daddy over Jason Robards. Johnson has a more natural acting style and facial expressions than Newman ever had. Judith gives her portrayal of a woman who feels life has passed her by while waiting for her neighbor to propose a soft dignity and southern charm that is missing in the Woodward version. This version is almost impossible to find on TV or tape for what ever reason. If you compare the two you will see what I mean.,1439856000,6,632,4.364406779661017
367746,5,6301798945,Watched this movie years ago. Loved it then. Would love to have it on DVD to add to my collection. Notify if ever released on DVD.,1425686400,2,130,4.038461538461538
367747,5,6301798945,Why the bleeping heck is this movie NOT released in the U.S.?  I like this version better than the Paul Newman one.  Get with it NBC!!!,1423785600,6,135,4.153846153846154
367748,4,6301798945,"I love this movie, obviously since this is VHS, picture quality is not that great, but was just glad to get it, Don Johnson at his best, wish this would come out in DVD or blu ray!",1414195200,5,180,3.891891891891892

367750,5,6301798945,"This movie has to be one of my all-time favorites. Of course, i love Don Johnson in it, but all the actors are excellent. I have watched it so much i think i have memorized some of the scenes, word for word. But i only have it in VHS. I really need to watch it again on DVD. Please somebody help.",1389571200,8,296,3.8688524590163933
367751,5,6301798945,"Judith Ivey plays the love interest of Don Johnson.  This was made when he was the most popular in the TV series, and the film shows he is a good actor, not just an action star.  Others in the film - are wonderful also.",1387497600,2,219,3.9545454545454546
367752,5,6301798945,"I remember when this tv movie was broadcast on NBC in 1985.

Don Johnson and Cybill Shepherd are glorious in this barn-burner (literally) of a steamy story, and Judith Ivey plays her role with both grit and grace.

Bring this to DVD, please!",1383091200,5,241,4.5813953488372094
367753,4,6301798945,"If you are a Don Johnson fan, then you will love this version of the classic. Johnson portrays Ben Quick with energy and magnetism, and his shirtless scenes make the temps rise. Judith Ivey is also great in her role.

The reason I am giving this tape a 4-star instead of a 5-star rating: I purchased it used or in ""good"" condition. The tape, a Blockbuster item, does play without streaks, but the color seems ""off,"" too soft and out of focus. The second tape plays with some noise--annoying. The tape I recorded years ago was in much better condition, but when my old VHS unit ate it, I had to purchase this used tape to replace the one in my video library. The price of a new tape was way out of my budget. So, for those of you who purchase a used VHS, just be aware that ""good"" condition may not always be good. As far as the supplier goes, I give them a 5-star; the package arrived on time and intact, and the tape itself was cushioned.",1357776000,4,939,4.216666666666667
367764,4,6301798945,Loved the original with Paul Newman but this new cast  was very good - well worth watching - if you can find it,1356566400,3,111,3.8260869565217392
367765,5,6301798945,"OMG...this movie is my all-time favorite! Don Johnson is simply amazing as Ben Quick. If you are a Don Johnson fan you will definatly enjoy watching this movie. Smart, sexy and very entertaining. Don Johnson at his best!!",1349568000,3,221,4.842105263157895
367766,5,6301798945,One of my favorite movies and still not on DVD or Blu-ray what a shame - would definitively be a best-seller ...,1339372800,5,112,4.136363636363637
367767,4,6301798945,I watched this years ago and loved it. I want to go back in time and see it all over again!,1281312000,5,91,3.380952380952381
367768,5,6301798945,This is such a wonderful movie.  I cannot believe it is not available on DVD yet.  What is with these people?  My VHS  version is almost worn out.  I would love to own this on DVD.  I think every actor/actress in this film is so perfectly cast.  This version of this story is so much better than the original(?) with Paul Newman.  Don Johnson and Judith Ivy are superb.,1267747200,6,369,4.246376811594203
367769,5,6301798945,This was a great movie.  My Aunt was actually an extra in it!  I was so glad to get this.  Our family only had it recorded off tv years ago.  So I gave this copy to my Mother for her birthday.  She cried (my Aunt passed away 2 years ago.)  My Aunt had said that it really was that hot the day they taped the movie!,1259020800,2,314,3.6818181818181817
367770,4,6301798945,"I was lucky enough to see this on TV years ago and really enjoyed it. The casting was very good - Robards, Johnson and Ivey really stand out, in my opinion - and, as other reviewers have pointed out, Johnson and Ivey burn up the screen. Their love scenes are not in your face but, in keeping with the title, they are hot! The 'less is more' idea...

After seeing this, I tried to read the Faulkner story on which it was based, but gave up. But I had taped this and am really glad to be able to re-watch it (for as long as my VHS tape and VCR last), even though it's not available on DVD. Yet, that is, I live in hope!",1257811200,3,617,3.936
367771,5,6301798945,"Purchased the vhs 2 tape movie from Amazon.  I had taped the original showing of the TV movie back in 1985 and still have it with the original commercials in it.  This is a great movie with a wonderful cast.  Can't say enough about Don Johnson and Judith Ivey.  She is wonderful in this and what a beautiful natural southern accent.  And what a sizzler by Don Johnson!! The scene after the picnic with these two was the sexiest love scene ever filmed.  Jason Robards was wonderful as the father, as was William Russ(Jody) as the troubled son.  Cybil Shepherd was very good also.  The new vhs tapes of this movie are very good, especially on a 46"" tv.  Color very good and I see details on the new tapes that the old taped original does not have.  Love watching this movie and until it comes out on dvd. this will do very well.",1251331200,4,826,4.305194805194805

367773,4,6301798945,"This was a great movie,better than the original in alot of aspects.  The only thing that threw me off was the town itself. There wasn't anything there,just what Will Varner owned,which was about 4 buildings,if you can call them that. Other than that,this really turned me on to Faulkner.",1238976000,2,287,4.857142857142857

367796,5,6301798945,"For all the romantics out there this is one of the best ever ! If you are a lover of romance, fighter for the underdog or just plain love Don Johnson then this is the movie for you. I can't understand why it is not available on dvd ... it would be a big seller if it was.",1183334400,2,271,3.689655172413793
367797,5,6301798945,"Remakes seldom hold a candle to the originals, but this remake is head and shoulders above its source material. At the heart of it are two standout performances by Don Johnson and Jason Robards who explode from the small screen with such power as to leave the two fine actors in the dust who originally played the parts of Ben Quick and Old Man Varner.  Combined with incredible production values and a fine supporting cast, the 85' version thoroughly supplants the 58' version as the definitive dramatic rendition of the work of William Faulkner.  Bring it to DVD, please!!!!!",1178150400,4,577,4.818181818181818
367798,4,6301798945,"A favorite feature. Don Johnson and Judith Ivey are spectacular, the supporting cast stellar, without exception (yes, right down to Rance Howard).

367800,5,6301798945,"The title of this movie exemplifies the movie's passion and sexiness, especially Don Johnson's topless scenes! (This is must for Don Johnson fans!!) Don gives this movie what was missing in the original when Paul Newman played the same role. (Don't get me wrong, Paul also played a great interpretation of the same role in the original, but Johnson adds an energetic passion that was missing in the original character.) Cybill Shepherd also plays a sexy role in this movie...especially as a character you would expect a wealthy Southern son to buy! The Hot Summer Southern nights surely do not cool off with either of these actors around!

Different character representation and interpretations are specific qualities each actor contributes in this film. While I am not undermining the quality of the original version's creativity, this version is a more modern interpretation of the original. Highly enjoyable with quite a bit more action than the original, this version brings a bit more viewing pleasure and less ""dragging"" as is sometimes experienced with the original.

What is most enjoyable about this movie (both versions), is its education and cultural representation of ""Southern values and prejudices."" If you love movies about the south, you'll surely enjoy this one! Both versions are ""Southern Classics"" in their own right!!

One downfall is the lack of availability on DVD. I believe this movie would once again become more popular if it was available on DVD. I would definitely buy it! Even though it is only available on VHS, this is not a movie with parts you would want to ""skip over"" or ""jump to the next scene,"" as ALL of the scenes in this version are excellent!",1132272000,45,1684,4.98576512455516
367801,4,6301798945,"Really, I have no idea how this was compared to the original version. Frankly, I don't really care. The movie, on it's own merits, is wonderful.

I've never been a particularly big Don Johnson fan, but he and the other actors in the film do an excellent job. I forget they're actors and I can't give any higher praise than that.

I own this on VHS and if the idiots in the studios would get their crap together and push it to DVD, I'd own that too.",1121990400,66,448,4.137931034482759

367803,5,6301798945,"I remember watching this movie on NBC.  I was in fifth grade and drooling over this sex symbol.  Don Johnson played a drifter Ben Quick, who was mysterious and trouble to some of the residents in the small town.  Varner, played by the late Jason Robards, was a man who was respected in his community.  He liked Quick.  Varner had a daughter Noel, who was aloof and would later find herself in the arms of Ben Quick.  Sybil Shepard was Eula Varner, the wife of Jody Varner.  She cheated on Jody with another man.  When she showed up beaten, Jody was quick to believe Ben did it.  When the murder of her lover and a fire occurs, Ben is the first suspect.
Ben, being a drifter, attracted women because of his physique and cool attitude.  Don Johnson has sex appeal and a collective attitude that made him good for this role.",1080864000,26,821,4.377483443708609
367804,5,6301798945,"I have seen both verson's and as much as I love paul newman I liked the remake better. Don Johnson makes you feel his torment in a way that Paul Newman did not. Judith Ivey was good as the love interest because she was not beautiful. In the original the the brother and the boy friend were play by actors that I like, but their personalitys were too strong for the roles they were playing. The longer running time let the writer develope the chactors better and let the plot, relationships, and suspence build gradually.",1029456000,8,520,4.484210526315789
