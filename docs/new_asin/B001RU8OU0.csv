8338885,4,B001RU8OU0,"GRANDES PELEAS Vol. 22 - Okay, boxing fans, this DVD has fast friends Julio Cesar Chavez and. Jose Luis Ramirez slugging it out, Ray Mancini testing Alexis Arguello's mettle, and Marco Antonio Barrera bullying Prince Naseem Hamed. Ringside boxing commentaries are in English, for those who care. Me, I say, let the fists do the talking.

- Julio Cesar Chavez vs. Jose Luis Ramirez  (October 29, 1988)

A kinder, gentler Chavez? Maybe, on this night, against this one guy. Jose Luis Ramirez was a standout fighter in his own right, but in the scope of Julio Cesar Chavez's celebrated career he figured in as just one more blip. But this fight was interesting in that Chavez and Ramirez were very good friends and former stable mates, and their friendship impacted the fight and rendered it less brutal than it should have been. Chavez, heralded for his crunching left hooks to the body, was instead able to tee off with his right, and he had Ramirez stunned several times. Except that, surprisingly, he then didn't follow up and instead let Ramirez off the hook. The most telling example was the 4th round, in which Chavez rocked Ramirez with a sizzling right but then didn't finish him off, much to the ire of ringside commentator Kevin Rooney. Anyway, Chavez's superiority showed out, and I just hope these guys are still friends.

- Ray Mancini vs. Alexis Arguello (October 3, 1981)

There are many reasons to root for Ray Mancini. Guy was a frenetic action fighter. He was from a tiny, blue-collar town. There was that nice story about his wanting to win the title for his father. But what drew me in was his absolutely awesome, onomatopoeic nickname: ""Boom Boom."" He was what one called an ""honest fighter."" Mancini wasn't the most talented, but he was a hard worker. He always came to fight. On October 3, 1981, on the CBS network, he took on the great WBC lightweight champion Alexis Arguello.

Boom Boom gave a terrific accounting of himself and for a good chunk of the bout his chances looked good of stripping the classy technician of his belt. Mancini swarmed Arguello early and often and even stunned him here and there. But Arguello was legendary for a reason and he never did lose his composure even though his eyes began to blacken. His class and power began to tell during the championship rounds. With moments to go in round 12, Mancini, good chin irregardless, got seriously wobbled by a huge right hand. In round 14 a left hook, a right hand, and another left hook did Ray in. And the pride of Youngstown, Ohio would have to wait just a bit longer to get that belt.

- Marco Antonio Barrera vs. Prince Naseem Hamed (April 7, 2001)

I think I was one of the few people outside of Europe and specifically, Sheffield, England, who actually appreciated the cocky Prince Naseem Hamed. And it's really because of his brashness that I liked Hamed. Because, yes, the Brit had a big mouth, but he was able to back it up. When he promised to ""stretch"" people, he did it. And, awkward, unorthodox boxer that he was and with his hands always dismissively held low, he always put on a good show (one of his flashy ring entrances had him coming in on a friggin' flying carpet!).

But, on this night of featherweight supremacy, pitting Naz against Marco Antonio Barrera, I had that early sense of ""Uh oh"" when the Prince decided to forego his flamboyant habit of flipping over the ropes and into the ring. I remember his putting his gloves on the rope as if he was about to do his somersault over and then I saw him back off from the deed and instead just step into the ring. ""Uh oh,"" I thought. Hamed was nervous. From there, it was downhill for Naz.

The talky Brit relied on the dynamite in his left hand to make up for his lack of combination punching. And with his very unorthodox style he was frequently off-balanced, so that when he did get hit, it often looked worse than it was. Barrera was called the Baby-Faced Assassin because of his killer's mentality (and because back then he had the face of a kid), but tonight Barrera metamorphosed from seek & destroy slugger to tactical technician, tempered his natural aggression to put into play an intelligent game plan. He took advantage of the Prince's flaws, circled to his left to stay away from Hamed's powerful left, and exquisitely timed him, connecting with sharp punches that soon had Hamed's right eye all marked up. Barrera got to Naz from the first round on, and Naz never did get a foot in the door.

It was a whitewash and a beatdown and a bullying. It was such a shocking drubbing that one tends to discount the punches that Naz DID land. And Barrera didn't shy away from resorting to ugly. In the second round, both guys grappled to the canvas and, with both still on the floor, Barrera got a jab in. In the final round Barrera disdainfully shoved Hamed's face into the turnbuckle. Hamed began the fight with his usual grinning antics, but he wasn't smiling much in the latter stages. Yeah, I saw this fight. This was when the curtain closed on the British showman. Prince Naseem Hamed would only fight one more time after this, but it would be a lackluster effort and would make obvious that the Hamed entering the ring more than a year after his encounter with Barrera was a much diminished version. Barrera basically retired the Prince, after first dethroning him. Fight commentator Larry Merchant turns another good phrase: ""The improvisational style that the Prince has developed since he was a boy is being exposed by a well-schooled boxer-puncher-brawler.""",1268352000,,5537,4.645556690500511
