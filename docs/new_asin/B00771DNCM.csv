5058965,5,B00771DNCM,Excellent set of experiments! Our children and grand-children love them!,1429056000,,72,6.3
5058966,5,B00771DNCM,"bought for my kids. they enjoyed it alot - the smaller children were amazed. my 15 year old son- who likes science- said that he had done a few of the experiments on his own already but he enjoyed hearing the explanations given. so, its not experiements that you have not seen before but the presenter is very thorough in explaining each cleary. no flashy lights or camera angles but good science. we liked the film very much, good job.",1400544000,,436,4.4625
5058967,5,B00771DNCM,My fourth graders thought the experiments were interesting. Some even went home and tried them there. The presenter did well.,1400198400,,125,5.3
5058968,5,B00771DNCM,I like that this has quick easy projects that kids can watch and do with household items. My 2 1/2 yr old watches it and pays pretty good attention. I know he'll really enjoy it when he can participate in the projects more himself.,1396483200,2,231,4.2727272727272725
5058969,4,B00771DNCM,"You will be dazzled by the light and clear presentation of science concepts that jump off this disc in an amazing way.  Amazing Science/is reminiscent of the classic 1950s TV series, Mr. Wizard.  For those old enough to remember, Ron Herbert hosted the Saturday morning program, which taught a lesson on science.

Jason Gibson has put together a unique perspective to teach young children important, basic science concepts in his newly released DVD series.  The first disc of this two-disc, volume 1 series, consists of 12 experiments and the second one, 11 experiments, utilizing household items that any child can assemble.  As children are encouraged to duplicate the experiments, they become engaged with science concepts from the start through hands-on participation.  While the experiments teach scientific concepts, kids have fun putting them together.

The presentations are wholesome and inviting, detailing the elements utilized to carry out the experiments.  The presentations are a little marred by hesitations and stuttering, punctuated by you knows.  However, children may not notice them and be more affected by the motivating style of the presenter.  Although some of the presentations are rough, each lesson will motivate and help mold a malleable, young mind.  I believe Amazing Science has an amazing future.",1386288000,7,1327,5.424390243902439
5058970,5,B00771DNCM,"We love this DVD! Easy to follow & try the experiments on your own. They also do a great job of explaining the results.
My six year old son begs to watch this and do the experiments. I'm excited he thinks it's FUN!",1385078400,3,214,4.0
5058971,4,B00771DNCM,"My grandson just turned 14 the week before we watched most of the video. I wanted to see a few certain experiments explained that I had showed him recently. We had done the one about dropping a magnet through a pipe. As we watched other parts of the video I saw he was getting bored. That's why I say age 13 max. Very good 7-8 to 12-13, depends on the kid of course.",1365033600,14,366,4.027397260273973
5058972,5,B00771DNCM,"My 7 years old son loves science very much. He watch this vedio over and over again, and tried to do the experiments by himself. And he is waiting for the Volume 2....",1358035200,9,167,4.090909090909091
5058973,5,B00771DNCM,"I really think he has hit on something in this video, as you get to learn something related to physics without having to go through a bunch of equations or a lecture on theoretical stuff. His videos are quick and to the point and display something useful, in mybe 15 or 20 minutes, so you are not investing a full hour or several hours to concentrate on the subject matter. Instead you get the point within approx 15 minutes and as opposed to a lecture on a white board, it is a video of real world items doing something cool. I use the word ""cool"" here to mean extremely interesting and slightly unexpected and something you can do at home for yourself. Things like dropping a magnet down a copper pipe and it falls sort of in slow motion even though magnets are not attracted to copper and after seeing it he explains why in easy to understand language. Another cool one is taking a q-tip with dish soap on it and touching a plate with water on it, and in the water either pepper or in another experiment it is food color drops. In both cases the pepper or food color move aware from where he touches the q-tip, as if being invisibly pushed. It is not exactly psychedelic but still cool to see it, and again, his explanation is clear.

His presentation style is great. He is not trying to be funny and show us his sense of humor, he is not rattling on like some of the advanced math professors I had in college, but he just talks like a normal guy and it is good enough that you actually do learn something in a short time.",1329609600,30,1525,4.258620689655173

8511434,5,B00771DNCM,"My kids really enjoyed this. We have several DVDs by Jason Gibson and have found him to be a great teacher. My kids have commented that they appreciate that, unlike some other similar science experiment videos they have seen, Gibson doesn't veer into cheesy/hokey territory of bad jokes. He does explain how many of the experiments could be demonstrated as ""magic tricks"" that kids could do for their friends, so the presentation style is interesting and fun without any of the groan-worthy jokes found in far too many educational videos for kids. The experiments are clear, and I think almost every single one of them is something that kids could probably go and do right away, as most of the experiments are done with basic household items that most people already have. (And if you don't already have them, they are easy to find.) My kids have watched tons of science experiment videos, but there were a few on this DVD that were similar to ones we had seen before, but were still new to us in the way that the scientific concepts were demonstrated. I think this DVD would easily appeal to kids ranging from grades K-8. As of now, only Vol. I is available. I hope other volumes will follow, as I would not hesitate to purchase them as well.",1484092800,,1243,4.603603603603603
8511435,5,B00771DNCM,Daughter loves all the experiments.,1474675200,,35,6.2
8511436,5,B00771DNCM,very informational,1474416000,,18,8.5
8511437,5,B00771DNCM,"Yet another great dvd from this guy. The BIG deal with this series of experiments is that he gives clear, common language explanations as to what is going on. I am planning to use this not only with my children (aged 9-16) but with other children also.",1464739200,,252,4.382978723404255
8511438,5,B00771DNCM,"As usual, Mr. Gibson delivers.  His experiment are clear and interesting--great for
kids and adults, too!",1446076800,,105,5.5625
8511439,5,B00771DNCM,Very interesting; very clear; will use it with my class!,1439856000,,56,4.7
8511440,5,B00771DNCM,The kids have really enjoyed watching these and have learned some very valuable things.  Fun and educational.,1430179200,,109,5.411764705882353
8511441,5,B00771DNCM,"I was planning to show these one at a time, but they were so engaging the kids couldn't wait to see the next experiment.  The question is, is it worth watching again? Apparently so! The best part about these experiments on DVD was the clear details and that it doesn't look old or outdated.  The bonus for me is that it builds excitement for the kids to see what we are planning to do. My only disappointment is that the case says Volume 1 which leads me to thing that there is a Volume 2? I have a looked and I haven't been able to find it.",1430092800,,541,4.046728971962617
