I have the video tape version, but I am concerned that my VHS players will soon end up on the trash heap and then what will I do?",1313884800,,213,4.071428571428571
7819413,5,6301977904,"THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH (1968) was the first-ever TV mini-series, running 3 hours over three non-consecutive nights. Shortened by 1/3, it cuurently exists only as a theatrical release. Lost in the process are many interviews of partcipants, witnesses and victims of the 12 year horror that was Nazi Germany.

The book's author, William L. Shirer appears twice. Stock footage, particularly of Post-WWI Germany is of great interest. Excerpts of several Hitler speeches are seen and heard, but translations are few and subtitles non-existent. Clearly intentional, for this is no unbiased work. At times the outrage and seething hatred for Der Fuhrer is so obvious you can touch it. Narrative insults are employed (not that the bastid didn't deserve 'em!). In its present form,  ""Rise and Fall"" is a fast-moving story consisting primarily of contemporary war and other footage.

A David L. Wolper production for MGM, directed by Jack Kaufman, written by Alan Landsburg. Film score: Lalo Schifrin (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mission-Impossible/dp/B000HWZ4HU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mission Impossible</a>"").",1244419200,4,1162,5.9879518072289155
