8734820,5,B015X21QDO,"Fester is an amazing horror movie that has the feel of movies like House of 1000 Corpses, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the Thirteenth; wherein the cinematography is almost as if you're there, you know  the old 70's/80's horror flick feels. Being that it is an independent film, don't expect crazy effects or anything of that nature, as if you would anyway if you're a true horror fan. Fester (our fun furry psychopath) is simple but complex at the same time...I don't want to give too much away; which I could if I just go on about it. But it's a very well done independent film, supporting independence is pretty normal in this country right? lol. Just buy it; if you like the old horror and feel and the cinematography of them and still have some imagination left, you'll love this! I think anyway.",1445212800,,803,4.615384615384615

Slowest meat cleaver wielding maniac of all time. On and on and just pick apart how horrible it is but I won't. Watch it if you double dog dare.

My teeth are stained and far from perfect but the lead actors grill is worse than London teef and much scarier than Festers the hare are.

Better than decent music and Fester looks pretty cool in his get up. Plus I can't lie Fester rips out grandmas tongue and uses it to paint her with it is the coolest part of the movie. But those 3 things are not enough to save this baaaaaaaaaaaaaaad film. Said the movie sheep. Bad meaning bad not bad meaning good.

Sorry to be a dick but this film was torture to get through. Maybe that was the idea.",1445040000,,899,4.149425287356322
