4246168,1,B0041LATE6,"Three of us watched this movie last night and nobody liked it.  Ed Asner was good, the dog was good and a young girl was good.  Other than that the other actors were terrible, the script was bad and very predictable.
I don't know what the other people who like this were watching  but we would definitely not recommend it.",1313280000,3,322,4.333333333333333
4246169,5,B0041LATE6,"When i first encountered this film, i thought it was going to be another typical kid's film. This was truly moving. Highly recommended.",1297900800,3,135,4.913043478260869

8413029,2,B0041LATE6,"These Are Not Dog People! This is not a heart warming dog story. In fact the dog ""Sheeba"" (amazing dog) is an after thought to these people and the story!
This is a self absorbed, heart shut down, group of people dealing with grief. Angry, bitter, blah-blah.
Ed Asner is the only actor in the bunch.
What a disappointment.",1516665600,,322,4.47457627118644
8413030,5,B0041LATE6,"Great movie although  Covers lots of political, emotional, and family issues.",1513728000,,77,6.0
8413031,2,B0041LATE6,"The script needed a lot of tightening up.  The acting was fair.  The boy was an unpleasant character, rude and obnoxious.  And finally, despite the title, the story was not about the dog at all.  The dog is really quite trivial to the story.  Also, the ending is corny and unbelievable.",1513468800,,286,4.529411764705882

8413033,1,B0041LATE6,";cornball.  too much loud music.  movies are supposed to be entertaining and for years and years all they are is a bunch of wasted time.  boring.  just a bunch of junk thrown together to waste your time with.  different names, different geography , same old, same old.  Just cause you like him so much, Ed Asner is always good to see again.  He's an old friend, like his voice and his charm.",1508112000,,391,4.347222222222222

8413035,2,B0041LATE6,"Could have and should have been a much better screenplay.  Actors cast were great, except for the mother...continuity severely lacking.",1497398400,,135,5.75
8413036,2,B0041LATE6,too slow of a plot. Plot moves at a snail's pace. good actors cannot save this movie.,1496620800,,85,4.0588235294117645
