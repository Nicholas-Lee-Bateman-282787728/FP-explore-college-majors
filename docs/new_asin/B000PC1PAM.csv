2815142,4,B000PC1PAM,"This is a must-have for any Red Sox fan old enough to remember the 1967 Red Sox. The recording of the penultimate game of the '67 regular season on the second disc alone makes this 2-DVD set worth buying.  Minnesota fans might also enjoy this look back at the great Twins teams of the 60s, even if this particular game was a loss.

The NESN documentary, which is ostensibly the main feature of this video production, is a little over the top in its description of the 1967 season as the birth of ""Red Sox Nation"".  Sports fans who are familiar with Bob Ryan's tendency to characterize everything as the greatest or most incredible something-or-other in the history of organized sports will recognize his influence in the writing. For me, as a Red Sox fan who rooted for Dick Stuart to win the RBI title in 1963 and was thrilled to see Felix Mantilla start at second base in the 1965 All-Star team, all this hype about 1967 got to be a little irritating.

Not that 1967 wasn't the greatest and most exciting baseball season in the history of organized sports, however.  Taken as a whole, the various features on this set manage to remind us of most, but not all, of the memories of the 1967 Red Sox.",1183939200,5,1198,4.4520547945205475
2815143,4,B000PC1PAM,"1967 forever changed baseball in Boston.  It is hard to believe but there were fewer than 1000 people in attendance at some games in the early part of that decade even though unreserved grandstand seats could be had for $.75.  That situation changed for the next 40 years as the 67 team went from last to first, clinching the pennant on the last day of the season in a 4 team race and building a new generation of fans who remain with the team today.

This DVD relives that year in 48 minutes.  Some of the highlights (such as the fight in Yankee Stadium) are very clean.  Others may not be of the same high quality but are still fun to watch.  The corny Impossible Dream verse read by Ken Coleman and Don Gillis is bearable if you remember that it was written at the time and reflects the era.  If you can take the Carl Yastrzemski song, you can probably deal with anything.

This is pre-steroid and free agent baseball.  Players would paint houses or work other jobs in the off season to keep going.  There is an innocence to the game that shows through the scenes in the DVD.

There is a bonus inclusion of the Impossible Dream television special from 1967.  This gives you a look into production values and attitudes of the time in addition to the game.  This is the first time I have seen the video since I first saw it at 14 years old and I still got a thrill out of it.

There is a separate DVD with the penultimate game against the Twins.  This game is as exciting as the final game and is highlighted by a Yaz home run.",1183248000,5,1528,4.2387543252595155
2815144,3,B000PC1PAM,"Hi...

I was very anxious to get this DVD set..even though I'm  from Southern California I was a big fan of the Red Sox as a young fan and of YAZ and Lonborg etc...and looking forward to this 40th Anniversary set.  The extra features are fun but the main program is a scant 48 minutes and while it has good footage and a nice storytelling to it..ALL of the interviewees are Boston area columnists or politicians NO PLAYERS?!!!  I was so dissapointed to not have YAZ or Jim or Rico or any of them on the program. The extra features are vignettes (that curiously have the odd player interview?) an old documentary of around 48 minutes that is horribly faded and hard to watch and the second disc is a complete game from the final weekend series with the Twins. They mention that it is the OLDEST complete game in baseball available in color...so its a valuable piece of history. Unfortunately it isn't the clincher with Lonborg...but the game the day before...still a valuable curiosity, and the main thing making me not rate this much lower as its cool.

Sadly I'm not sure I'll visit this set very often ..if more than once on  most features...",1181606400,21,1144,4.529126213592233
2815145,5,B000PC1PAM,Got on time.  Excellent service.  As a baseball fan I enjoyed the dvd.  The 1967 world series was my first baseball memory.  Ireally enjoyed seeing the old baseball action and interviews with the red sox players.  I would recommend to any baseball fan.,1199232000,,252,4.767441860465116
2815146,5,B000PC1PAM,"I was only a high school freshman in Massachusetts when the Rod Sox participated in the '67 Series, and nothing has ever matched the feeling we shared when we rooted the Red Sox on to a world series victory.  This 2-disc set is absolutely the most complete and accurate video document of the 1967 season in all of its glory.",1193443200,,324,4.4
2815147,5,B000PC1PAM,"The Impossible to Forget DVD has scenes that brought back many memories. I was a boy of 12 on Oct 5, 40years ago at Fenway Park for Game #2 of the World Series. The clear pictures of Yaz's home runs are wonderful.  I called my Dad in Mass. to thank him and talk about what we could remember from 1967.

Many Thanks",1191801600,,314,4.048387096774194
2815148,5,B000PC1PAM,"I was a 11 year old Little Leaguer in 1967, being drawn further into the emerging Red Sox Nation through my pocket transistor radio. Game-by-game, win-by-win the Red Sox players of that year made a huge impression on my brothers and I, just as The Beatles had been doing with their music. We have records, books and movies to remember The Beatles and now we have the Impossible to Forget DVD to remember the 1967 Red Sox. When I purchased my copy and sat down to watch it for the first time, I was filled with great memories of the Summer of '67, that ARE impossible to forget. Then I discovered the second DVD in the package- the September 30, 1967 television broadcast of the game against the Minnesota Twins . A game that had to be won by the Red Sox to stay alive in the American League Pennant race. A game that I did not watch on TV or listen to on my transistor radio but watched at Fenway Park with my father and two of my brothers. I couldn't believe what I was holding in my hands - a DVD containing vivid images of that Saturday afternoon game in late September so long ago. That game was my first ever visit to Fenway to witness my transistor radio heros in person. As I watched the full-color video, I couldn't help but smile and remember how that game cemented my citizenship in Red Sox Nation for life.

If you're an aging Red Sox fan with memories of the 1967 Red Sox season, you can't afford to miss this gem of a DVD. It's the Sgt. Pepper of Red Sox Nation!",1191801600,,1475,4.2304964539007095
2815149,5,B000PC1PAM,"This documentary is a tribute to the 40th anniversary of a season that deserves to be remembered forever. The footage is incredible, and the interviews are great. There's great bonus footage, including the original t.v. tribute from 1967. Make sure you get the package with the bonus disc, that has the entire next to last game of the season. Quite a historical record that really shows how the game has changed in 40 years.",1188432000,,424,4.743243243243243
2815150,5,B000PC1PAM,THIS WAS THE YEAR I BECAME A SOX FAN.  IT WAS MY FIRST RED SOX HEARTBREAK BUT IT WAS AN AWESOME TIME.  I WENT BACK IN TIME 40 YEARS.  IT WAS GREAT.,1187740800,,147,3.53125
2815151,4,B000PC1PAM,Great DVD with most of the material coming from NESN specials aired in 2007.  My only disappointment was I thought that the 2nd DVD had the final game of the year vs. the Twins but it actually contains the Saturday (next to last) game.,1186358400,,235,4.340909090909091
2815152,5,B000PC1PAM,"Anyone who lived through the thrill of the 1967 season will love this DVD set, anyone too young will still enjoy it as it the season is the birth of the Red Sox Nation.  The DVD of the next to final game is outstanding, the color is as good as todays.  It is also nice to see the difference between broadcasts of 1967 and today.  Great stuff, all Red Sox fans would love it.",1185148800,,374,4.027027027027027
2815153,5,B000PC1PAM,"I remember that weekend like it happened a few days ago.  One game up in the standings, two games to play, the Twins had to win only once to go to the World Series.  Just one, lousy game...

I've seen parts of the DVD, and will buy a copy for myself.  It was great to see Killebrew, Oliva, Yaz, Petrocelli and others of that era again, although I would have preferred to see Sunday's clinching game.

No matter; the late Ray Scott was the Twins'announcer in 1967, and he said he got a gut-wrenching feeling during Saturday's game the Twins would not beat Boston.  He said it was one of the most depressing feelings he'd ever experienced as a broadcaster.  To us faithful in Minnesota, those losses were as crushing as any a Minnesota team ever suffered.  And that includes the four Super Bowls.",1184544000,4,794,4.465277777777778
2815154,5,B000PC1PAM,"The 1967 Red Sox separate the ""bandwagon"" fans from the real fans. This is where the real Red Sox Nation starts. All the highlights, all the player profiles, all the clips you could possibly want from the Impossible Dream season. This would have been enough but, an entire pivotol gave is included as a bonus disc. In color, no intrusive graphics cluttering up the screen, just as it was broadcast on the second to last game of the season. A ""Dream"" DVD.",1184198400,3,454,4.548780487804878

8190240,4,B000PC1PAM,"They should have clean up the faded colors, this is why i removed a star. Otherwise,this is a decent documentary about the 1967 RED SOX.The game between the RED SOX and the TWINS is fun to watch and of course historic. being the first color broadcast of a baseball game. Feels funny to see the hitters hit with no glovesThe players nowadays no longer use earth with their hands. YAZ for instance has the same ritual when he comes at bat. It's easy to understand why 1967 was so special for the fans who had waited a long time before their team started to be contenders.",1467936000,,569,4.377358490566038

8190242,5,B000PC1PAM,"This is my all-time favorite sports documentary.  I know it's ""only"" 48 minutes, but it's an excellent 48 minutes!  The best part was the way they included the soundtrack from ""Man of La Mancha.""  (This was a hit Broadway production at the time, and the Red Sox adopted ""The Impossible Dream"" as their fight song for the season.  Somehow, opera and/or classical from that musical adds a great artistic touch you won't find in NFL Films.)

The end credits were fascinating...and, in some ways, a bit sad and spooky.  To hear that rousing theme music, while seeing all those old newspaper and magazine clippings, was awesome.  But, at the same time, it reminded me of a time so different, it may as well have been another planet.  I was born that year, but it would have been great to have experienced it as a teen or adult.  It blows my mind to see a picture of old Busch Memorial Stadium (the ""cookie cutter""), while the original Fenway Park remains.  Anybody who was old enough to remember that time will agree that, sure, America was a mess then, as now.  BUT...!!!  For just a few months in that chaotic summer, the Boston Red Sox allowed everybody to get away from that living hell for two hours (remember those short games?), and enjoy the most thrilling Pennant race in baseball history.",1438560000,,1293,4.598253275109171
8190243,5,B000PC1PAM,"Pretty hard to explain what it is about the 1967 Red Sox that made such an impression on me.  In our home, baseball began and ended with the Yankees and the Red Sox were pretty much forgotten.  But in 1967, I fell in love with baseball, and the Boston Red Sox.  I was raised in Idaho, live in Harmon Killebrew's home town, have never been east of the Mississippi, and probably will never get to Fenway Park in my lifetime - but in 1967 I began to live and die by the Red Sox.  I love this dvd and along with the book ""The 1967 Impossible Dream Red Sox - Nowlin & Desrochers,"" read and viewed together makes the nine year old boy that lives inside this fifty plus something old man so very, very happy.  I love the 2004 team - in fact I play the dvds of the drubbing we gave the Yankees once in a while - there is no end to the satisfaction that comes from seeing the jerks from the Bronx go home with nothing.  But as I write this, I think that this team, this season (1967) was the first time that I really separated myself from my parents and began to realize that I could chose and value something for myself.  And for that, the kid in me is grateful.  Put aside any expectations you might have and just enjoy one of the greatest teams to ever step onto a ball field.",1330992000,,1270,4.072289156626506
8190244,5,B000PC1PAM,This is a must for all old school baseball people...I am a Twins fan but the game on the second disc was worth double the price..The broadcasting was just baseball no radar guns/ no contract talks/no stupid gimmicks/just balls and strikes and a Killebrew Homerun..Though the twins lost the game with Yaz also hitting a homerun and an interesting view of a Young Ted Kennedy and Vice-President Humphrey before the game....I love it...,1271203200,,433,4.945205479452055

8190247,5,B000PC1PAM,"Altough the Red Sox have won the World Series TWICE this century,the Impossible Dream season of 1967 remains as one of the MOST cherished and memorable years in the history of the Boston red Sox. Unfortunately for me as a besotted Yastrzemski worshipper and fan,I was too young to actually LIVE this wonderful season but have read a good deal on this subject and the ""Cardiac Kids"". This is an EXCELLENT documenary of the players,season and excitement created througout New England(and elsewhere!!!) during the ""Summer Of Love"". My ONLY complaint(which is echoed by others in their reviews here)is that I had hoped and expected that the ""Bonus"" DVD would have been of the Pennant clinching Oct. 1st Sunday game as opposed to the Saturday Sept. 30th game - I do believe that IT WAS a ""nationally televised"" game so I find it hard to believe that it doesn't exist in some form(If ANYONE can answer this,it would be GREATLY appreciated!!!!) I do think this is a MUST DVD for ANY RED SOX FAN(Past,Present AND FUTURE ;) !!!!)",1239062400,,1020,4.768361581920904
8190248,5,B000PC1PAM,"This is one terrific DVD.

If you are a baby boomer from the New England area, or you are just BoSox-curious, you will love this 2-DVD set.

Disc 01 features a tremendous 40th anniversary recap of the 1967 season, which appeared last year on the New England Sports Network (NESN).

Bonus material on Disc 01 features the original ""Impossible Dream"" show that appeared (in B&W) on Boston's WHDH-TV, after the 1967 season had finished.  Also included are three segments from the 1967 World Series highlight film, specifically the three wins posted by the Sox.

Arguably, Disc 02 is even more interesting than Disc 01.

It's a near-complete copy, of the local broadcast, of the next to last game of the 1967 regular season.  The Red Sox hosted the Minnesota Twins in Fenway, needing a win to stay in the race.  The makers of the DVD claim the copy of this game represents the oldest complete-game broadcast available, of any baseball game, that had been telecast in color.  Jose Santiago started for the Red Sox, while Jim Kaat pitched for the Twins.  Early in the contest, Kaat exited the game with an injury, giving way to Jim Perry, brother of Hall-of-Famer Gaylord Perry.  The Sox came from behind, hung on, and won, behind homers by Carl Yastrzemski and George Scott.  Boston went on to take the final game of the season the next day, clinching the flag, behind a complete game effort by Jim Lonborg.

Be advised Disc 2 is also available as part of a six-DVD set called ""The Essential Games of Fenway Park.""

Just plain great stuff ... get it.",1202860800,,1545,4.6531365313653135
