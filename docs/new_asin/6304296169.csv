7868283,5,6304296169,"Ermo is a movie about a young woman that has to take on the tasks of being the bread winner in her family. Her husband (the former village Chief) is elderly and not capable of doing the tasks a man needs to do to take care of his family let alone the duties of a husband to his wife. Ermo finds herself working extremely hard with no rewards other than keeping food on the table. There is not much about her life that she can control. She considers her circumstances as she says in her own words ""fate"". Ermo decides that she wants to break free of routine of her life and village life by finally doing something she feels would truly be an accomplishment. That happens to be buying a large TV for her family. This obviously isn't something that someone in her position should be doing but she is determined to do it anyway. Ermo wants to finally have something that isn't representative of the hardworking life she has lived and a giant color T.V. is a symbol of that vanity. Her husband the former village chief tries to tell Ermo that they should use the money to make the house bigger and that a TV is not important. He doesn't understand Ermo's desires let alone her feelings about the unchanging life she lives from day to day. Working hard and not having any item of comfort to show for it. Ermo's Neighbor whom she hates is the exact opposite of her. She lives a pampered life and doesn't have to lift a finger because her husband provides for her. She has a TV,plenty of food, and an ""active"" husband to satisfy her. Ermo is the exact opposite of her neighbor and because she sees how easy life is for her she despises her. Hidden in the movie are also themes of a changing society that's developing both economically and socially. In a way Ermo is a representation of these changes as well. She's a noodle maker that used old hand making equipment and then later starts using industrialized machines to make noodles. She also want's to use her money to buy a TV instead of investing it into the land. Not to mention she is a woman that is taking the role of doing a mans job along with other women who have become the earners for their family. There are a lot of different messages in this film and that's one of the charms about it. Although many Chinese films convey the same economic and social messages Ermo is a bit different in that it's more about being satisfied, than doing what has to be done. Ermo was a woman that was doing what needed to be done but she becomes a woman that does what satisfies her instead.

  Overall this is an interesting film worth taking a look at if you are looking for a good foreign story to watch.",1350172800,,2646,4.341414141414141
7868284,5,6304296169,"To really appreciate the subtle mastery of this film, a working knowledge of Taoist thought is helpful.  The idea that our lives become polluted and complicated by desire and not understanding our ""inner nature"" puts it in the proper perspective.  In this light, technology is questionable (consider the menchanical noodle maker that destroys a man's hand, and the subsequent failure of the truck to get him to a hospital), and economic ""progress"" creates an unwholesome society (Ermo experiences life in the impersonal city).  So the film really sticks it to the complications created by the shift to consumerism.

It's also a magnificent character study w/ the title character.  Her ambition and intense pride make this a tragedy in the Aristotelian sense.  This is certainly not ""hilarious"" as the cover quote promises!",1178496000,,822,5.236641221374046
7868285,5,6304296169,"While Ermo is a film that may be labeled anti-consumerism, it is likely only a reaction to the growth of capitalism in a country that still maintains some Communistic ideological values.  The film likely serves as a warning to the Chinese population that says, ""Beware of materialism, if it is your number one value then there will be consequences.""  The film's message is relatively easy to ascertain.
 How is the movie not anti-capitalist?  While Ermo, the village woman who is at the heart of the story, is consumed by the accumulation of money, she does not accumulate it simply to purchase capital.  Neither is she all that selfish, since her accumulation of money is for the goal of purchasing a television for her son.  However, it's her motivation for buying the television which should be analyzed.
 The want for the television is really just an allegorical tool used to represent materialism.  Since China has loosened the restrictions on private ownership of business and invigorated the stifling atmosphere that held back individual enterprise, its population is experiencing a growth in materialism.  Under these circumstances, many people are turning to things that inflate their sense of individualism--i.e. status symbols.
 This movie seems to be in response to this trend.  However, more specifically it attacks the tendency for women, in particular, to neglect their households in favor of earning more money and buying more things.  From my Western viewpoint, this at first seems sexist.  A movie like this would never be made in the U.S. for that reason alone.  But upon further review, I feel it is more than that.  The movie is simply a reminder that a person cannot have it all.  Value systems necessitate that things be placed in greater or lesser standing in relation to their importance to the individual.  The problem then arises, can providing things for your family be a replacement for providing time?  The answer is explicitly answered in the movie.
 Ermo places her position in jeopardy for her materialistic goal.  She neglects her family's needs and her own physical wellbeing in the process.  Even her happiness is forgone, and for what?  The true trap of materialism is that once you've obtained your object, it fails to give you the happiness that was anticipated.  There are two responses to this phenomenon, either the person will look for another object to work toward, or they will become depressed and seek fulfillment through another means.  The only hope is that it will dawn on people that materiality is an illusion...and that what is really important is relationship to those around you and to yourself.",1067126400,2,2650,5.039080459770115
