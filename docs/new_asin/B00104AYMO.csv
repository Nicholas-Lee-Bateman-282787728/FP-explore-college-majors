8236945,1,B00104AYMO,whatever the merits of the show - and I remember really liking it as a kid - packaging a complete set in 11 boxes is a perfect example of excessive packaging.  Surely they could have used a multi disk box to reduce the waste - and lower the cost.,1509235200,,246,4.020408163265306
8236946,4,B00104AYMO,"I enjoy the series - but one of the disc - ""Volume 2"" was empty - no disc whatsoever.
There remaining discs were all good and clean - but surely wish that I could get Disc 2",1505001600,,173,3.7027027027027026

8236949,4,B00104AYMO,"A classic from the golden age of television,wonderfully done and brings back memories for the baby boomer generation and introduces new ones for those just now seeing it.",1361404800,7,170,5.107142857142857
8236950,4,B00104AYMO,"Ramar of the Jungle is still good family entertainment.  This of course was written for children and teens of the 1950's and the film is in pretty good condition to be that old.  It is interesting to see how they patched together film from the studio with old film of Africa and India in order to produce a low budget series.

I am old enough that I saw these as a child, but I still find them to be entertaining.  The DVD's were all in good shape and were as good a reproduction as you can expect.",1345161600,14,498,4.103092783505154
