3165876,4,B00170ICZ2,"""Elmer Gantry (1960) with a dose of The Intruder (1962) on a 75 cent budget.""

There is the one-sentence synopsis for Shanty Tramp (1967), written and directed by Joseph P. Mawra. Mawra was a lesser-known director of numerous grindhouse films (such as 1964-1965's Olga trilogy, produced by Glen or Glenda`s George Weiss). Movies from this sadosexual school of filmmaking were often referred to as ""roughies,"" and here the lighting alone justifies that moniker.

After watching Shanty Tramp, you'll never think of the song ""When the Saints Go Marching In"" quite the same way. The film opens with a worm's eye-view of the Shanty Tramp herself (Lee Holland, in her only film role), barely squeezed into a tight white dress and pumps from hell as she shakes, jiggles, and marches her tramp way into a tent revival, choreographed to a gospel tune.

The little incubus-Eve is bound and determined to distract Preacher Man and every other male with red blood, which includes Daniel, a young African American male whose Ma warns him about the wiles of evil Shanty Tramps.

There's a gleam in Shanty Tramp's eyes when she spies the tithing basket. There's a gleam in Preacher Man's eyes when he spies Shanty Tramp's popping cleavage. They promise to rendezvous later for a ""spiritual lesson,"" but Shanty Tramps get easily distracted.

The local rock-n-roll bar is man meat magnet for our heroine. Shanty Tramp grinds. Shanty Tramp flirts. Shanty Tramp gets fought over and the winner is... Savage, the leader of a biker gang! ""Come on big man! You promised me a fin! I wanna see it!"" She tells Savage. ""Shut up and put out, babe!"" Put out she does, and darn it, Savage actually lives up to his name and frolics rough.

Meanwhile Daniel's Ma is still warning her son: ""Tain't good for black folk to be out at night! You get that Shanty Tramp outta your mind! "" ""Oh come on Ma!"" ""Them whites in this town, they're the same ones who strung up your Pa!""

Daniel's not listening. He's hearing the call of that succubus Shanty Tramp. The wise words of Ma can only fall on deaf ears when Shanty Tramp does her mating call. Daniel's just in time to hear Savage yodel, ""You teasing' little bitch!"" Poor Shanty Tramp has lost her top. It's the exploitation version of Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman (1943) with Daniel and Savage substituting for Lon Chaney and Bela Lugosi, They crash into a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon. Daniel proves the better man and our heroine rewards him with some interracial action. Unfortunately, Shanty's drunken Pa stumbles in to see Shanty and Daniel sharing a sweaty cigarette.

The redneck villagers, torch in hands, are in full pursuit of the black monster while his Ma has to pay the ultimate sacrifice for her little Cain. Shanty's Pa gets sober enough to realize his little girl was engaging in consensual interracial sex. Pa grabs the old testament whip and ... off with her top again!

Throw in patricide, exploding cars, racial revenge, and bed-hopping that goes full circle back to Preacher Man (who don't mind sloppy seconds so long as he gets to save a soul from the Devil's lair). The sacrifices poor Preacher Man has to make doin' the Lawd's work!

Enjoy it with friends, but after shuffling your guests out the door, a tub full of Calgon is strongly advised to take you away from all that Shanty Tramp residue.

If David Lynch and John Waters had filmed a script by a totally stoned out, drunken Tennesse Williams, who was trying to combine To Kill A Mocking Bird and Elmer Gantry - Shanty Tramp might be result.

Shanty is not bad and its not so bad it good. Its just plan ole great. Dog on it! There really was some talent involved here, that must have disappeared almost instantly into total obscurity. Why didn't at least one of these folks go onto greater things?

The editing, photography, writing and acting all hit the right note. There is irony, and there is atmosphere.  Did I say atmosphere? I mean ATMOSHERE! The folks in charge of lighting and photography got great realistic night time shots in every scene - long shots as well as closeups and on a shoe string budget too! Believe me this is not such an easy thing to do. The editors and or the director wove in great segues that were very well thought out.  Shanty Tramp was something much more then a throw-away film to the people that made it and it shows.

Shot in black and white against a steamy rural southern town. Shanty Tramp takes place during one evening over maybe a two to four hour period. It could have almost been filmed in real time. Yet in this short time it tackles all kinds of subjects and taboos, victims, predators, drunken welfare dads, prostitution, lechery, incest, shady revival meetings, hypocritical Elmer Gantry preachers, motorcycle gangs, bar fights, beer drinking, patricide, interracial sex, annoyed southern cops and the magnificent Emily (The Shanty Tramp herself)

Also we must mention a bar room rock and roll dance - I call it the Shanty Dance - I believe Shanty performed the first version of the dance that would latter be made famous by some peanuts characters in A Charlie Brown Christmas - sorry Charley but Shanty got there first. What a dance and what a piece of music. One of the babes does an awesome twist too.

The acting is beyond superb as everyone takes their part seriously and plays it straight with lots of personality. The major part actors knew their characters - and they don't give you a moment to think you are watching actors - you only see the characters not the actors. In particular the preacher and Emily's Dad are outstanding. And the Emily herself (actress Lee Holland) - lets face it - she is the star of the show and in almost every scene - as she struts, wags and grinds her way around town and only occasionally shuts her mouth over those magnificent white choppers. Emily practically drools over every dollar she sees. Maybe I'm crazy but at the right angle Emily is not to bad to look at. That is when she is not being too serious and gives a nice big smile or when she is in a particularly lecherous mood.

And oh Lordy - the magnificent dialogue and innuendos between Emily and the preacher in the Rival tent! Just after she eyes the collection plate and licks her lips. There are so many great lines here and in the entire film that I lost count. If this film had ever taken off - there would be a half a dozen recognizable phrases now peppering the everyday American dictum.

There is a great opening sequence with The Saints Come Marching In on the soundtrack with the camera firmly planted and frozon solid on Emily's loveliest of a**. What an opening as Emily eyes every other Tom Cat up and down. You can feel the heat, smells and humidity coming out of the TV.

Now I must say that most of you"" normal folk"", (such as my wife) will absolutely hate Shanty, hate Shanty's Dad, hate Shanty's naked body, hate The the preacher, hate the motorcycle gangs clothing line, hate the town, hate the revival meeting, hate the old ladies in the rival meeting, hate Shanty's drunken Dad, hate the title of the movie, hate the crickets, hate the bare light bulbs and hate everything about this most excellent of all films and walk out on it within 10 minutes.

But there are those - and we know how we are - who will love this film so damn much it causes a pain in the gut - it might even become your absolute favorite film of all time.

So do yourself a favor and wait until the hottest, sweatiest night of the summer - grab a six-pack or a case or two, put on an old worn greasy tee and tattered boxers. Scratch your belly, pick at your ears and sit down on that hot, muggy night and let the crickets chatter through your open windows, put your best gal beside you or on your lap or kick her out of the house and throw Shanty in the ole DVD player. You'll be there - right in the middle of it - a very dark but real looking place - a place where you ought not to go and were warned against when you were a kid, but were probably  interested in. Not to many films can pull this off the way Shanty does.

I give Shanty five stars not only for being one of the finest sleaziest movies ever made but also in the hopes that some company will get the bright idea to present Shanty in a beautiful pristine print as Emily herself truly deserves - but the copy here only gets two sweaty stars as the film print is tattered spliced speckled, cut up and noisy - for now its all we got - it will have to do.

Thanks Lee, where-ever you are. You were a real sport!  And thanks Joe Prieto - nice job! - Your fans.",1267920000,17,5284,4.353658536585366
3165879,5,B00170ICZ2,"If you've a taste for the cheap and vulgar, ""Shanty Tramp"" will serve you a feast.

Emily is the most available woman in a small, southern town, and the daughter of the town drunk.  She can be had for five dollars, which is about how much I paid for the DVD.  Bargains, both.

The story follows Emily--played by the pneumatically talented Lee Holland in her first and last film--to a tent revival where she successfully propositions an evangelist, to a biker bar where she picks up the leader of the pack, to an old shed that is home to an even older mattress that has served Emily well in the past and which one suspects contains more DNA than has been seen by the entire cast of CSI.  Along the way and for added spice, Emily beds a young black man; not a good idea in the South, circa 1960.

Murder; a $5.00 whore; a motorcycle gang; rape--real and claimed; alcoholism; racism; a lynch mob; and, a greedy evangelist combine to form the elements of one of the worst movies ever made.  I loved every lousy frame of this film that is so bad it's great.

8264424,4,B00170ICZ2,"Finally, ...finally a movie without a single redeeming feature.
It's got bimbos, boobs, boozers, bongos, beatniks, bootleggers, bikies and bible-bashers, not to mention some bad, bad dialogue!

The cast? Well they could be wash-ups from your local police roundup, together with a few inbred alcoholics.
The script? Pure trash!
The lighting? Appalling!
The music? Ludicrously inept!
The acting? Amateur doesn't even begin to describe it.
The cinematography? Think aim in the general direction, shoot and hope for the best!
The transfer? Surely done by medieval monks onto parchment?
The contrast is pulled up so high in an effect to sharpen it that at one stage the leading lady's face is reduced to just a flat white oval devoid of any features whatsoever!
And my recommendation after all this?

DON'T MISS IT!!!!
Seriously, this movie sets new lows in just about everything but it will have your jaw dropping and wondering just how they got away with all this back in 1967.

Basically it's the story of a local slut, anxious to make a few bucks by selling her only available asset. (Oh and I DO mean ""available""!) However here she doesn't make any cash at all but still manages to create havoc for a whole town in just one night with her unbridled actions.
She flits from partner to partner , all in the hope of being paid, but something always interrupts at the crucial moment.
Bare boobs feature throughout, .....along with sadistic drunken beltings, and a holy-roller tent preacher only too willing to indulge in a bit of un-holy lust between tent shows.

There's also a sequence of some inter-racial sex, ...white woman and a black man that must have had 'em burning those theatres down South in the USA!
(Safe to say the K.K.K would NOT recommend this one!)

It's full of racy dialogue.  During a heavy petting session, one bloke claims he's got a ""fin"" for her, ...and a bit later when the convenient old mattress has been found and all seems ready, our little Shanty Tramp demands to see his fin. ""Ya said ya had a fin!""
Can the word ""fin"" REALLY have been a slang term for an erection? As in sticking up like a shark's fin?

This little piece of slut-trash even stoops to crying rape when she's caught enjoying that aforementioned bit of interracial humping and sets the eager posse of red-necks, complete with burning torches and bloodhounds ( I kid you not!) off on the trail of the bloke she's just enticed! We learn that they've already burned his Pa sometime ago!
Oh and of course his dear ole black Mammy, who tried to warn him about the dangers of getting mixed up with the little tramp has just been murdered too by the passing gang of bikies! The leader having been another set of grubby hands our little sex-pot's been through that same night!
Told you this pic had everything!
Then on top of all this there's bootleggers, car chases, fiery car crashes, but eventually she's found out for just what she really is.

Huh? As if she's not already known as ""the town bike""!

The final sequence has to be seen to be believed.
After a savage belt-whipping by her alcoholic Pa,(bare boobs out again of course!), our little tramp simply gets up, calmly murders her Father, then blithely puts on a new frock, combs her hair and decides to escape town with the preacher and his travelling tent show.

He's only too willing to take her into his caravan with the final words ""I'm going to show her the POWAH of the LAWD!!!""
(And I don't think he means he's going to save her soul anytime soon!) The van then is towed away with the inhabitants inside apparently hard at their devotions.

This is a movie that will make you feel in need of a shower IMMEDIATELY it finishes, ....or at the very least I'd recommend that you keep some hand-sanitiser close at all times...

However, after watching all of the above, if you think you can take it, you just HAVE to see at least one of the included special features.

Do not miss ""ALICE from DALLAS""!
Salacious and racy little number that she is, ...specially if you happen to be into even more bare boobs, suspender belts and stockings!",1408233600,11,4085,4.641274238227147
