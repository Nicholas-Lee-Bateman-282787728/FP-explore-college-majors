8597667,1,B00DTUY70M,The selection menu buttons don't work so one can only see the first segment of the DVD. When pressing the menu selection buttons the selected box turns red and nothing happens. Don't buy it!,1458604800,,190,4.617647058823529
8597668,1,B00DTUY70M,Horrible.. It doesn't play. The product should be sold if it doesn't work. Zero stars,1425513600,,85,4.733333333333333
8597669,3,B00DTUY70M,"Having recently traveled to Italy, I was hoping for a video to remind me of my trip as I biked along. Most of the scenery was bland with nothing to see. It could have been in the states. Gave a quick, occasional and quick shot ofolive grove or building to remind you of Italy. Needs more Italian scenery!",1424649600,,304,4.258620689655173
8597670,1,B00DTUY70M,"When I saw the Bik O Vision Bluerays and DVDs on the Amazon site, I was very excited to have my husband order me one for Christmas.  I thought I would start with the Tuscany one and then add to my collection so I could collect many to watch on snowy sub zero days in Illinois, as a sort of a 30 minute inexpensive vacation.  When we put the first disc in, I was less than impressed.  The way the video is shot was exactly what I was looking for... a simulation of driving through the countryside on my own.  However, I had to go back and double check the details on the item on the Amazon site to make sure we had ordered a Blue ray that was supposed to be HD.  We had ordered the HD Blue ray... but this video is definitely NOT HD.  It looked terrible and grainy on our TV... so I tried it on our computer monitor which is considerably smaller... same deal.... NOT HD.  Very disappointed in the quality of the video.  I don't know how everyone else who reviewed these videos thought they were fine, unless they are not used to watching a HD signal on their TV.  I had 6 other videos in my Wish List, and I may buy one more just to make sure I just didn't have a bad disc... but at this time, I have to tell you if you are like me and can't stand watching video that is not HD, don't buy these, you'll be disappointed.",1420934400,,1318,4.019157088122605
8597671,5,B00DTUY70M,"This is my absolute favorite DVD of Bike-O-Vision's!! I paid a lot of money to go to Italy back in 2009, now whenever I want to visit the beautiful scenery again I just put this DVD in my DVD player and relive the wonderful memories while getting exercise to boot! Can't beat that!",1412812800,,281,4.320754716981132
8597672,4,B00DTUY70M,Good scenery and music. A few sections could be anywhere in the world so I tend to skip those. The uphill ride into town in the rain is very dramatic and I wish it would go on longer!,1384300800,3,183,3.8421052631578947
8597673,5,B00DTUY70M,"How super wonderful that I can now visit one of my favorite places on earth and get some exercise at the same time! Every time I get one of these Bike-O-Vision dvds I feel like I'm a squirrel, stocking up little healthy nuts for the long, cold winter :-) This winter I plan on popping this disc into my player to revisit San Gimignano as I did years ago- and it still looks exactly the same with those amazing midieval, square stone towers. And the hills of ancient olive groves and vineyards around that area... oh! I just know I'll be doing this one again and again.
And there are some nice surprises here, too, where the producers decided to go really off the ""tourist trails"" (Italy can be crowded with tour-groups in certain places, especially in summer) and even off the atlas- according to the very detailed ""maps and routes"" section at the end of the video. You go to some of these authentic hill-top villages where you can actually see the people are curious about seeing new faces!
Watching these Bike-O-Vision videos, I've never felt more like I'm actually there, traveling and exploring. Did that make sense? Anyway, everyone with any interest in Italy should buy this dvd!!! (And I see Amazon has it in Blu-Ray, too which I'll bet looks even better?)",1382832000,2,1263,4.6177777777777775
