6775756,5,B00OY7YO52,"After watching these videos the second time, I found them just as inviting and vibrant as the
first time.  The scenery that Steven captures is amazing, and the people are like old friends,
even though we've never met.  I feel like I could start a conversations with these people and
have it feel like we've only missed a short amount of time since the last time we talked.

'A Year In Italy' takes you to places that are rarely mentioned in other documentaries: the heart
and soul of the people.  Steve digs for the stories of real people and how they live in a country
influenced by some of the world's most sought after tourist attractions.

So, how is it that other travel documentaries leave me feeling like I've been in school studying
for a test, and Steven makes me feel like I've come home?  These videos are a work of art,
not just the cinematography, it is also the choice of locations, people, topics.  I loved watching.
I know I will enjoy them over and over and over again.",1356739200,5,986,4.444444444444445
6775757,5,B00OY7YO52,Certainly makes you feel as if you are there. He captured the true feeling of the country. Gives us the incentive to spend longer periods of time than 2 pr 3 weeks on each trip!,1355616000,3,177,4.085714285714285
6775758,1,B00OY7YO52,"I hate to criticize someone's good efforts, but to watch this video is tantamount to torture.  I love Italy and I love travel videos, but this one doesn't do it for me, at all.  Boring narration, annoying music, too long and poorly edited, not at all entertaining ... and it's too expensive.  Mi dispiace.",1344556800,4,305,4.611111111111111
6775759,5,B00OY7YO52,"It was very enjoyable in that it showed Italy from the average tourist view.  Did not contain that many already seen sights, but gave a backdoor view of life there for a year.",1339200000,2,175,4.303030303030303
6775760,4,B00OY7YO52,"The DVD follows the film maker's trips around Italy and includes home movies taken by various Italians which give a certain intimacy to the DVD.  It isn't a glitzy promotion of some tour company's offerings which is usually the case, but instead, a closer look into the scenes and people of a wonderful country.",1324684800,6,311,4.7592592592592595
6775761,1,B00OY7YO52,"Beautiful pictures, but over that is absolutely annoying music and insipid, meaningless narration.

Imagine how it might have been if we'd been able just to see the images and hear the street sounds or whatever, instead of jarring, annoying music laid over.

And as for the narration?  Nothing to see here, folks.  It's awful.  There aren't even facts given like Rick Steves might, it's just this guy's thoughts and amateurish delivery.

I'd skip it.",1319760000,7,450,5.013513513513513
6775762,5,B00OY7YO52,"I have watched this twice. I am on my way to Italy - again. This video was the inspiration to get me off the dime and go. Go now. Go before it is too late (as Steve says). I have loaned this to friends. They are buying their own copy to view and view again.
It is insightful. The music and visuals are a delight. Grazie - for making this film.",1319414400,5,343,3.8450704225352115
6775763,4,B00OY7YO52,Not your typical travel DVD / Video -  If you like to get a real sense of Italy and its people / history / and smaller out of the way places this will work for you.  Just a very nice enjoyable to watch DVD -  More of a documentary travel format. If you have older Italian relatives then they will fall in love with this presentation.,1313020800,11,333,4.015151515151516
6775764,5,B00OY7YO52,"The double DVD set is a revelation and an inspiration. If you never go to Italy, these remarkable images of the people and places may be the closest you will ever get to a real trip to Italy. But after seeing this wonderful work you will want to go whether on your own or on a tour, by train or by car. As Steven McCurdy says, it doesn't matter how you go, just go before it's too late.",1301011200,15,386,3.9615384615384617

8685274,5,B00OY7YO52,"We loved this video and have watched the first disc twice. However, the packaging may be a problem because when we attempted to remove the second disc from the container, it cracked and we are unable to view it. We are considering ordering another copy so that we can view the second disc. It really is that good. Great photography, narration, and music.",1443916800,,354,4.634920634920635

8685278,5,B00OY7YO52,Very quick shipping and a wonderful disk to watch each evening as a reward for putting in a good full day.  So well done and such beautiful scenery and experiences.  Highly recommend it.,1382054400,3,186,4.606060606060606
8685279,5,B00OY7YO52,"I find most travelogues dull because they do not express the feeling of being there and they dwell too much on the major sites. This is very different. I loved all the interviews in Italian, especially the old priest in the Sardegna sections. They are translated in subtitles of course!",1380758400,3,286,4.74
8685280,2,B00OY7YO52,not what I expected - a year in Italy I thought would show culture and holidays celebrated throughout the year with landscape and food and traditions,1377907200,,149,4.769230769230769
8685281,1,B00OY7YO52,This was so bad I couldn't finish watching it. It's not in HD so everything is distorted. The narrative might serve as a cure for insomnia but that's about it. The section on Sardinia made me determined to never go there. This is a worse travelogue than the home movies my neighbor used to show us when we were kids. Save your money for a real trip to Italy.,1372118400,,358,4.202898550724638
