8442626,4,B004V2FVC0,"I was 'Audiographer' or 'Sound Designer' for Loot Maar. This film's announcement boasted as the first Bollywood film to have 5 top villains of that time, in it. Popular film tabloid 'Screen' carried the announcement with pictures of Amjad Khan, Prem Chopra, Ranjit, Kader Khan and Shakti Kapoor. The film was produced at the Mehboob studios at Bandra, Mumbai. Mehboob studios has always been Mr. Dev Anand's favorite working place. He feels totally at home there. Mehboob studio has had permanent make-up room and the dress-room for Mr. Dev Anand, right from start. Now that he has made his own office premise called 'Anand Recording', he dresses up there before leaving for a shoot. A team of foreign visual effects generators was called to, create a sequence of camera traveling through universe before finally zooming in to the Earth. Film starts with this sequence. This was done in room of hotel Sun n Sand. The outdoor shoot of Loot Maar was done in the outskirts of Simla. We had made a set there too, that was constructed on an accessible road. So, it seemed like a real house. Entire shooting was done in winter. It was not very comfortable working on snow for more than 40 days. 'Jan Chhaye Mera Jadoo', became the biggest hit song of this film. It was sung by Asha Bhosle and was shot on Simple Kapadia. Another good number was 'Piya Hum Saat Mulk Ka Pani', shot on Dev Anand and Mehmood. Mehmood too had a interesting cameo in the film. This was Tina Munim's second film for Navketan, after 'Des Pardes'. Rakhee has been Mr. Anand's favorite actress. They have worked together in many films. Post production, like dubbing and sound effects of the film were done at Ketnav recording studio, belonging to Dev's brother Mr. Vijay Anand. The film was dubbed on a film 'rock n roll' machine. Mr. Dev Anand was very excited about the back-ground music of this film. The film was premiered at the Eros cinema in Mumbai.",1300406400,,1924,4.695266272189349
