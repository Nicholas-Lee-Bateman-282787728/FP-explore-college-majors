1723404,5,B000068CNX,"There never has been a sitcom that truly pictures life among the singles (twenty-something) as good as this show does. It's not just comedy, it presents the episodes in such a way that one can truly identify with the situations they face so the audience has something to talk about in coffee shops too. The humor is universal. I feel like I'm part of the group every time I watch it because I feel the different emotions they go through. Plus, of course, it is so much fun because it's fast-paced. Every scene and every moment is relative to what is going to happen next so you don't feel like it is dragging you onto nothing. Just like how a sitcom should be. Funny!",1438300800,,667,4.387096774193548

The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that I was hoping that the episodes would include the full length time as the DVDs do (FYI: the show on TV doesn't actually play the entire episode. They cut out a few minutes worth of dialogue and plot to shrink it for TV. The full length episodes are on the DVDs.). I find myself really missing those extra couple of minutes, but I'm a hardcore fan. If that doesn't bother you, go for it! You can't ever go wrong with Friends.",1420502400,,570,4.098214285714286

1723497,3,B000068CNX,"Me and my wife are fans of Friends and enjoy watching it on amazon since we don't have to take DVDs around with us when we travel.  Season 2 isn't the best, but it's always nice to put on an episode even if it's still introduction to the characters.",1391472000,,249,4.081632653061225
1723498,4,B000068CNX,"The magical thing about Friends is that it gets better and better with each season.  Even if you hate their perfect lives and the way things happen with them, there's something in each episode that will make you laugh out loud.

Season Two has us starting off with Rachel knowing that Ross likes her and her eagerly awaiting his return from China.  However, when he returns it's not alone, and Rachel has her hopes dashed.  Meanwhile, Joey still struggles to find a job, but has some bright prospects ahead.  Monica has job struggles too, but her dating life takes a different turn.  Chandler is still Chandler and Phoebe is still Phoebe.

Chandler's my favorite character.  He's funny, has a lot of flaws, but keeps the levity.  Phoebe is probably my second favorite because she's quirky.  Ross is my least favorite, just because I find him annoying.  But really, the whole group is needed to make this show work.  Remove any one of them and the dynamic just isn't there anymore.  There are plenty of unique side characters as well.  They all seem to have crazy families.  The actors themselves always play the parts well.  They land the lines right, are fun to watch because they're good looking people, and seem to have a real passion for the show.

Obviously this isn't a very realistic show.  Sure stuff happens to them that happens in real life.  But I can't say I've ever encountered a group dynamic like the one in this one.  Of course most groups of friends don't have comedy writers scripting everything out for them either, so I'm sure that helps with the hilarity.  But it is wildly entertaining and those comedy writers know their stuff.  I really do laugh out loud (multiple times actually) for each episode.  And I gladly have a night of no sleep if I'm in a particularly good season.  It just has that power.

I enjoy Friends, and it's always a few week marathon of watching all the seasons over and over again.  Which means I should get started on that 3rd season now!

1723515,5,B000068CNX,"One of TVs most beloved series. It never lets you down, and always manages to bring a smile to our faces. My wife introduced me to Friends, as I was one of those men who just never really watched it growing up. One Christmas I surprised her and bought all 10 Seasons and included a special ""coupon"" that I would watch every episode with her before next Christmas. I made good on my promise, and after watching all 10 seasons, I become a fan. Sure there are things to criticize, and I there are other series (like Arrested Development) that I personally like more, but Friends will always be a staple. If you just need to smile, it's one of the best things you can put into your DVD player.",1387324800,,689,4.3076923076923075

I'm reminded of when Pheobe is possessed by the spirit of an old woman halfway through who remarks ""Now I've seen everything.""  Well, I wonder if she now knows how wrong she was.  Nevertheless, this season continued with excellence, giving new drama, new love interests, cats, a soap opera doctor role for Joey, along with a new roommate who's father was probably Norman Bates, Mupet-fur pillows, Tom Selleck as an eye doctor (should have made him a regular, not just ""recurring""), and so much more.  Through all of it, Monica, Ross, Rachael, Joey, Phoebe, and Chandler prove they've got each other's backs and we love them more for it.  Of course, every fan's biggest question is answered as television's newest power couple (or maybe they're the first power couple) hits the screen.  So, get this season to expand your Friends collection and find out why Old Yeller is brought up during the season.",1378684800,,1115,4.873015873015873

1723648,5,B000068CNX,"I personally like all 10 seasons of this show but there is something about Season 2 that just keeps you wanting to watch friends and re-watch this season. As this show gets into its older seasons there is always something that upsets me in some way. For example, Chandler just starts getting bashed on more and more later on and Monica gets really annoying. Also, Ross and Rachel never get back together ONCE until the end of the show after they break up in the 1st episode in the 4th season except for their little flings and Emma who's born in the 9th season. But even though all the seasons are good there are always some episodes in the other seasons that annoy me. However, the second season is not like this.

Season 2 of the show FRIENDS starts off right where it left off from season 1 and the story line is great. But the jokes and the acting and everything just gets better. This is where the show really starts to take off. It starts off with Rachel at the airport to welcome Ross back but he comes back with a  new girlfriend, Julie, and that starts the Rachel jelousy. Then Ross finds out that Rachel likes him and he realizes in the episode ""The one where Ross finds out"" that he needs to be with her. Then after a few bumps in the road they finally are able to get together which is a really great moment for the show. But I think this season is great not just for Ross and Rachel but for the other characters. You realize the closeness that Chandler and Joey have for one another in the episodes that Joey wants to and does move out before he comes back. Also, especially the really funny jokes chandler brings to this season starting from the beginning to the end which got better from Season 1 are good. Joey's character even matures throughout. Then Monica dates Richard and has a serious relationship that gets referred back to in the other seasons. I thought that was a good storyline to put in. Then Pheobe just brings her cool weirdness that plays an interesting part in the whole season. There are really no episodes at all in this season that I don't want to re-watch. They are all very good. Even the couple I maybe would say were on the lower end of the episode list have re-play value.

Here are the episodes in the season. If I had to choose a favorite disc or episode I would probably say Disc Three which I think is really good on top of the other ones.

1723651,5,B000068CNX,"While the first season of the show is highly enjoyable, it really begins to hit its stride in season two as we get to learn more about each characters' particular eccentricities and we witness more of the ties that bind these characters in friendship.  The most important element of this show was the chemistry that these actors had together and season two shows them really continuing to click.

Some of my favorites:

""The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant"": Monica unwittingly loses her job when her promotion leads her to accept a gift which, unbeknownst to Monica, is a violation of company policy.  The thing I like most about this episode is how it treats the disparate incomes of the characters and how the more financially strapped of the friends must deal with the financial advantages of the others.  Been there, done that.

""The One with the Baby on the Bus"": Chandler and Joey prove just how stupid they can be when the inadvertently leave Ross's son Ben on a city bus.  Phoebe's immortal ""Smelly Cat"" is introduced in this episode and she loses her performing gig at Central Perk, much to my chagrin as her strange lyrics and musical interpretation provided me with much mirth.  The episode also contains a memorable guest appearance by Chrissie Hynde, who is Phoebe's replacement.

""The One Where Ross Finds Out"": Rachel has a hilariously bad date that leads to a drunken confession of her feelings for Ross on his answering machine.  What I love most about this episode is Ross's immortal line: ""You're over me?  When were you under me?""

""The One with the List"": Ross breaks a cardinal rule by putting in writing things that are deeply hurtful to Rachel.

""The One with Russ"": Rachel dates Ross's clone, though she doesn't know it at first.  It's great fun to see David Schwimmer play two versions of his character.

""The One After the Super Bowl"": Chock full of guest starts doing a hilarious turn.  Chandler gets his comeuppance courtesy of Julia Roberts.  Dan Castellaneta (aka the voice of Homer Simpson) does a funny turn as a San Diego Zoo employee who has the information Ross is looking for but does a spectacularly bad job of trying to get Ross to pay for it.  Brooke Shields is hysterical as a wacko fan who is convinced that Joey truly is Dr. Drake Ramore.

""The One with the Prom Video"": We've seen how petty and downright mean Ross can be and now this episode shows us how kind and generous and thoughtful he can be.  This has to be one of the most memorable episodes in the series' long history.

""The One Where Eddie Won't Go"": Ah, how I can relate to Chandler's troubles with a truly deranged roommate.  Watching Joey and Chandler convince Eddie that he doesn't live with Chandler is so rewarding.

""The One with the Chicken Pox"": Few things are as funny as watching Phoebe and guest star Charlie Sheen paw at one another with oven mitts duct taped to their hands.  This is one of the episodes that shows how unlucky in love poor, sweet Phoebe is.

As I looked over the list and tried to choose my favorites, I realized I could have mentioned every single episode of season two.",1203897600,,3114,4.618181818181818
1723652,5,B000068CNX,it's a shame i wasn't in to this show a long time ago.  i did watch some of the reruns and after getting all my other shows out of the way i finally rented the first season.  i bought 1-3 so far and 1&2 are my favorite.  i can't believe the first episode of season 2 is so hilarious!!  definitly my favorite ep. so far.  great show!,1203379200,,332,3.8955223880597014

1723673,5,B000068CNX,"When we last saw our Friends, Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) had gone to the airport to meet Ross (David Schwimmer) who was returning from China.  She'd gone to declare her love for him.  What she didn't know, however, was that Ross was returning with a girlfriend, Julie (guest star Lauren Tom).  Naturally, that means we get plenty more complications to the Ross/Rachel relationship.  Will they ever get together?  Find out in ""The One with the Prom Video.""

The other four Friends are experiencing trials of their own.  Monica (Courteney Cox) loses her job and winds up searching for work.  On the plus side, she starts dating Dr. Richard Burke (guest star Tom Selleck).  The down side to that relationship is that Richard is old enough to be her parent.  In fact, he is Friends with her parents.

Joey (Matt LaBlanc) and Chandler (Matthew Perry) go through the breakup of their relationship when Joey moves into his own place and Chandler gets creepy new roommate Eddie (Adam Goldberg).  Meanwhile, Joey is enjoying the rise and fall (literally) of his career when he lands a part of the soap opera Days of Our Lives.

Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) is the one character with the least in the way of story arcs this season.  Not to say she doesn't get some funny episodes, like the one where she is possessed by a dead woman's spirit.  We also see the debut of her signature song ""Smelly Cat.""  And she starts trying to track down her father and gets half brother instead.

As you can see, there's lots going on in this season.  The show was still new with lots of ground to be explored.  And it was still at the top of its creative game with plenty of laughs each episode.  I especially love the conversations where they are talking about one thing, but it sounds like they are talking about something else.

If you are a fan of Friends, this is a great season to add to your collection.",1198800000,,1877,4.559880239520958
1723674,5,B000068CNX,"For any Friends fan, this season is a must for your collection. This season particularly is my favorite for many reasons. To state a few, the beginning of the Ross & Rachel relationship where you discover the great chemistry they share, Joey & Chandlers downfall of their friendship when Joey moves out after being discovered of his acting to become a star on Days of Our Lives, and overall this season has the best jokes and memorable story lines. All though there is a place in my heart that also adores season four and season eight because of their wonderful arcs including Phoebe being a surrogate mother and Rachel's pregnancy, season two still takes the cake.

Favorite Episode: ""The One Where Eddie Moves In""

--This episode was probably the funniest storyline through out the series and it was my all time favorite episode of the entire ten-season run. It was a close race with ""The One Where Everyone Finds Out"" and ""The One With the Embryos"". I love ""The One Where Eddie Moves In"" for two reasons: the first being Phoebe's discovery as a singer by a producer who wants to make a music video for her song ""Smelly Cat"". It is so hilarious when Rachel, Ross, and Monica sit on the couch in the room with Phoebe to watch her music video and the reactions of them all when they hear Phoebes 'fake' voice. I love how Phoebe thinks that is actually her singing and her comments like, ""Sorry guys but I sound incredible!"" It's just priceless and extremely funny. The second reason is the separation of Joey and Chandler when they realize how hard it is to live apart from each other. A great scene is when they play the song ""All By Myself"" during a silent sequence of Joey and Chandler thinking about each other. It's overall just a fantastic episode. Besides this episode there are many other great ones like, ""The One With the Prom Video"" and ""The One With the Lesbian Wedding."" Buy this season!

1723680,5,B000068CNX,"this is the second and one of the best seasons of friends!! after a great first season this hit roared back for a second season that was even better. everything you loved about the first season is back and even better than before!

  when we last left our new friends,chandler let slip that ross loved rachel at rachel's birthday party. rachel is shocked,but finds the idea of ross as a lover intresting so she goes to the airport(ross had to go to china,the country,for his work) to meet him only to find that ross is with a woman,julie(lauren tom in a great if sad turn as the woman who comes between r & r) and now it's rachel who must pine for ross as he dates julie. this is a nice switch on last years ross crush and really gives the show a lift. rachel's hate of julie is grounded in the same hate as was ross's hate for the italian man rachel dated in year one. chandler is still looking for the right girl,joey gets a t.v. soap job for a while and moves out,monica meets the man of her dreams,who also happens to be her fathers friend(tom selleck,who is a great actor and really builds a stong charter in his few shows,so much so that at several points in the series he would return),and phoebe discovers her mother (who killed herself) and grandmother lied about her father(the guy in the picture frames is said to be her father) and begins to look for him.

  the ross&rachel engine drives the season,but all get a chance to shine with the great show ""the one with phoebe's husband"" where we find out that phoebe married a ""gay"" ice dancer that see loved to help him get a green card. he returns to get a divorce so he can marry another girl(phoebe,don't hate me but i'm stright),chandler has a third nipple,monica had sex on the balcony with fun bobby,and joey did a porn video(he was young needed the job but couldn't do it so he just watched them have sex)! we also see rachel try everything under the sun to keep ross from sleeping wiyh julie(really a very fun night at ross's) and a moment of very hot talk as rachel helps ross get over his fear of not being good at sex!

  we also get ""the one where ross finds out"" where a drunken rachel blows a blind date worring about ross and leaves a message on his machine telling him she's over him,prompting the greatest reviel in history as rachel tries to stop ross from listing to the message(ross,""your over me,your over me,when were you....under me?"")and their first kiss(voted one of the best kisses in t.v. history)only to break them apart in the next one ""the one with the list""

  now we come to the best show in the bunch and maybe ever, ""the one with the prom video"" in which ross is told by rachel that they will never get together,only to have a video tape of her and monica's prom night show the true feelings of ross for rachel( the video is the first time we see rachel's nose before surgery and monica as a fat teen)and the final scene of ross in his dad's tux standing on the stairs is heartbreaking(rachel's date  had not showen up and after mom and dad talked to him ross was going to take her so see could go)! the show really hit it's best here as the whole cast reacts to this bomb. and the pay off of ross and rachel's kiss and the begining of their romance are just the begining of this great seasons treasures.

1723681,4,B000068CNX,"Season two of Friends picks up some from season one, although in my opinion it is just before the real glory days of the series.  During season two, several important events take place, including the beginning of Ross and Rachel's relationship, which will be such a cornerstone of the show's entire run, several episodes centering around Ross' newborn son Ben, and Chandler's crazy new roommate, Eddie.  Particularly good episodes in this season are: ""The One Where Ross Finds Out,"" ""The One With the List,"" and ""The One Where Eddie Won't Go.""  Memorable guest appearances are made by: Catherine Bell, Dan Castellaneta, June Gable, Adam Goldberg, Elliott Gould, Chrissie Hynde, Chris Isaak, Phil Leeds, Ron Leibman, Emily Procter, Giovanni Ribisi, Julia Roberts, Tom Selleck, Charlie Sheen, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Mitchell Whitfield, and Fred Willard.

Quotes from this season:

- Ross : Do you think he'll be surprised to see me?

Chandler : Yes, at first. Then he'll realize he's a monkey, and isn't capable of that emotion.""

- Chandler : ""If I end up like my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blonde chasing after 20 year old boys, or I'll end up like my mom.""",1152144000,,1167,4.953846153846154
1723690,5,B000068CNX,"Welcome to the sophomore season of Friends. This is where the show and its stars truly exploded onto the national consciousness. With the advent of season the second, the cast and crew had finally hit their full stride. Standouts were David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston as Ross and Rachel and Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe. The Ross and Rachel romance was the strong impetus of the season and had the fans very much invested in the goings-on of the star-crossed duo. But there was still ample room for the other four characters to shine. Kudrow was exceptional in episodes such as The One Where Heckles Dies and The One Where Old Yeller Dies. The best-friend relationship of Joey and Chandler is delved into in The One With the Prom Video and later in a three- episode arc (with a memorable guest star performance by Adam Goldberg). This season also introduced Monica's second greatest love and very good acting foil, Dr. Richard Burke (as superbly, intelligently played by Tom Selleck). Brooke Shields owes her resulting sitcom to her guest star turn in The One After the Super Bowl. But Jean-Claude Van Damme, Julia Roberts and Chris Isaak left fans with a tepid feeling. It goes to show that Friends is best when it's just about the six characters.

Highlight episodes are:

The One with Ross's New Girlfriend - the season 2 opener finds Ross and Julie an item, much to the chagrin of Rachel; Chandler goes to Joey's old tailor and is taken advantage of; Phoebe cuts Monica's hair ala Dudley Moore.

The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant - the six are divided over money issues; Chandler picks up a wrong number on his phone and hooks up with a hot girl (the denouement to that storyline is gutbustingly funny).

The One Where Ross Finds Out - a drunken Rachel leaves a message on Ross's phone; Monica is Chandler's new trainer, a fact he soon regrets; Phoebe's date won't put out (but he is Joey's god).

The One With the Prom Video - an old video tape reveals a college-going Ross and high-schoolers Monica and Rachel (the debut of fat Monica and one of my favorite Chandler jokes ""so how many cameras were actually on you?""); Phoebe states her lobster theory; Joey buys Chandler a friendship bracelet which Chandler doesn't want to wear; Monica is in need of a loan (check out the restaurant manager interviewing Monica right after the opening credits); this is truly a great episode.

The One Where Ross and Rachel...You Know - well, it's pretty self-explanatory; also, this is where Monica meets Richard (wherein Richard expounds on the intricacies of the head tilt and the head bob).

The One Where Old Yeller Dies - her mom had lied to naive Phoebe about the endings of sad films; Chandler and Joey bond with Richard; Ross freaks out Rachel with his long-term family plans.

The included special features here improve upon the first season's. This time, there are 2 episodes with producers commentary (The One With the List and The One With the Prom Video). The box set also contains an interactive map to Monica and Rachel's pad, a friends of Friends video guestbook, a trivia quiz and a dvd-exclusive, uncut version of the Smelly Cat music video. Not bad.

There's a reason this show was so well-loved and so much lauded by fans and critics alike. Come sit in for a fun chemistry lesson, as taught by Professors Aniston, Cox, Kudrow, LeBlanc, Perry and Schwimmer.

Some fun trivia facts about Friends:

The first person approached by the casting crew for Friends was David Schwimmer, the second was Lisa Kudrow.

When Matthew Perry auditioned for Friends, he had just shot a pilot for a sitcom about baggage handlers in the year 2020, which fortuitously fell thru.

The first cast member to star in a Hollywood movie is Marcel the Monkey.

The original concept of the show was to star Joey, Monica, Ross and Rachel. Chandler and Phoebe were only supposed to be supporting roles.

The record label wouldn't release the Rembrandts' album unless the band recorded a full-length version of ""I'll Be There For You."" The Rembrandts were reluctant to release the Friends' title tune because the band members felt the song didn't mesh with what they were doing musically.

The pilot is the only episode that shows in its entirety the opening credits sequence of the cast frolicking in the fountain. For the rest of the episodes, NBC insisted that scenes from various episodes be pulled into the opening credits, fearing that some viewers might not relate with hip, young folks splish-splashing in a fountain.",1150070400,,4509,4.776349614395887
1723691,5,B000068CNX,"Even more remarkable than ""Friend's"" first dream season was the fact that it managed to avoid a sophomore slump. With so much attention directed at it, people expected ""Friends"" to crack under the pressure. However, both the writers and the cast managed to keep the show fresh and funny in its sophomore season. Major storylines included the tortured Ross/Rachel love affair, Joey getting an apartment without Chandler, Monica falling in love with her parent's friend, Richard, and Phoebe beginning her search for her family. Some of the best episodes from this season include ""TOW Ross's New Girlfriend,"" ""TOW Heckles Dies,"" ""TOW Five Steaks and an Eggplant,"" ""TOW Ross Finds Out,"" ""TOW the List,"" ""TOW Phoebe's Dad,"" ""TOW the Lesbian Wedding,"" ""TOW the Prom Video,"" ""TOW Ross and Rachel..You Know,"" and ""TOW the Two Parties."" Ross and Rachel ultimately drive this season and the chemistry between Schwimmer and Aniston is amazing and will carry throughout the rest of the series. Aniston is especially funny here and viewers can see her beginning to grow as an actress and comedian. Aniston really brings a vulnerability to Rachel and even when shes conniving to get Ross away from Julie, viewers still root for her. She steals the show in ""TOW Ross's New girlfriend"" (""Ins't that kick you in the crotch, spit on your neck fantasic?"") and ""TOW Ross Finds Out"" (""And THAT my friend is what they call closure..""). Season Two is one of the best seasons of this long running sitcom and will provide many laughs for years to come.",1148428800,,1527,4.945525291828794
1723692,4,B000068CNX,"The second season of Friends is still not one of my all time favourite seasons. Yeah sure it has a lot of its memorable episodes, but at the same time it really didn't have that kind of bang when the first season arrived. Nevertheless I give this season set 3.5 Stars (it has to be 4).

One thing I didn't enjoy about this season was the character Eddie, he stayed on the show for about 3 Episodes but it really just dragged. I didn't like the episodes where Joey and Chandler were seperated basically because of this Eddie guy. Anyway, he left and the show got back to normal.

During this 1995-1996 season a huge Friends Backlash occured. Suddenly everybody got sick of them and hate websites were being made. This backlash I think kind of hurt the show in its Second Season.

However, there are some good episodes, my Personal Top 5 Epsiodes Are:

The One With Five Steaks and An Eggplant

The One With The Baby On The Bus

The One With The List

The One With The Prom Video

The One With The Chicken Pox (Lol this has to be my favourite of Season 2, as I recently had chicken pox and can relate lol :P)

Overall If you can only buy a few Friends Seasons I don't think its vital to purchase Season Two, definitley not the best out of the ten. However if you've got the money, got the time, or get it for free somehow...its not tooooooo bad.",1145923200,,1343,4.255905511811024

1723694,5,B000068CNX,"Season one was great, but this season was even better.

The building tension between Ross and Rachel until ""The One With The Prom Video"".  Then soon after the main focus becomes the risk of Joey and Chandler losing their friendship when Joey moves out for a better place.

This season started with Rachel being extremely jelous of Julie (Ross' new girlfriend), then them dating for one day until Rachel finds a list of pros and cons about her and Julie.

Then Ross desperately trying to get Rachel back until she views an old home video of Ross planning to ask Rachel to the prom, she is flattered by the video, and they get together.

Joey and Chandler were at a height in this season, with the ups and downs of their friendship, and Joey's period of stardom as Dr. Drake Ramoray of Days of Our Lives.

With those two things aside, there were also many short side plots in this season, Carol and Susan's wedding, Phoebe's gay husband, money, breast milk, wierd roommates, job searches, babys left on bus's, and Monkey's in movies.

1723697,5,B000068CNX,"My Top Ten Favorite Episodes -

This season is so good that it is hard to pick a top 10 list because of so many good episodes. Some episodes that didn't make the list would be high on some of the top ten of the last seasons of Friends. Probably the best season overall because of Ross & Rachel being together (later seasons screwed up by having them apart and dating others but occasionally getting back together and eventually having a daughter together still not as satisfying as season two's take on their romance). Disk 3 is almost perfect as far as great episodes go. Not one episode on that disk is a let-down.

# 1 - The One Where Ross and Rachel....You Know - This episode gaves fans what we wanted all along, Ross & Rachel on their first date. On top of that Monica & Richard (Tom Selleck) hook up as well and Chandler & Joey get the new chairs and a big screen tv. One of the best episodes of the series let alone this season.

# 2 - The One Where Eddie Won't Go - Hilarious episode. Eddie is very funny as the insane roommate of Chandler. Having Chandler & Joey reunited was a nice touch. The girls having empowerment leads to comedy when Rachel tells Ross something funny. Eddie is the show-stealer here and was missed after this episode. The episode also showed how Joey & Chandler living together led to great comedy.

# 3 - The One Where Ross Finds Out - Funny episode when Rachel is out on a date she drives him nuts because she is stuck on Ross. Rachel gets drunk and calls Ross leaving a message about how she is over him. A hungover Rachel the next day can't remember she left the message until Ross calls home to check his messages. Show has the best ending of the series when Ross & Rachel finally kiss for the first time.

# 4 - The One With The Prom Video - The first flashback episode to when Monica was fat, Rachel had a bad nose & Ross had his curly hair & mustache. Showed all the characters that Ross truly loved Rachel even back in her highschool and his college years. Phoebe's lobster story was funny and sweet.

# 5 - The One with the List - Ross gets himself into trouble just when it seems like he and Rachel are about to hook up. He can't seem to decide between her and Julie when Chandler and Joey suggest making a list of her good & bad traits. A great episode for Ross & Rachel being sooooo close to being together but he messes things up.

# 6 - The One Where Joey Moves Out - Funny episode for Joey licking a spoon putting it back without washing it and his story about soap. Emotional when Joey moves out making you think just when you think the show is stable and reliable anything can happen.

# 7 - The One Where Dr Ramoray Dies - Joey's character is killed off when he makes a remark about making up his own lines. Eddie seems stranger as Chandler's roommate. Joey & Chandler miss each other but can't bring themselves to admit it to each other.

# 8 - The One With Two Parties - The cast was top-notch here as they had to go between the men's & women's apartment to keep Rachel's parents away from one another. The men were at their best (especially Ross in dealing with Rachel's stiff dad). Joey kissing Rachel's mom to distract her from her ex-husband leaving was also un-expected and hilarious. Monica's freaky sense of order showed up majorly for one of the first times in the series.

# 9 - The One With The Chicken Pox - One of the best guest-star episodes of the series as Charlie Sheen plays Phoebe's sub-marine boyfriend who surfaces every once in awhile. Comedy ensues when Phoebe gets Chicken Pox for the first time and gives it to her boyfriend. Instead of romance the two try to scratch each other instead of making love. Monica feels she is too neurotic for Richard but he attempts to ease her mind by trying to convince her that she is normal.

# 10 - The One With Russ - One of David Schwimmer's best acting jobs as he plays a duel role as Russ & Ross. Rachel dates a guy who is exactly like Ross & everyone sees the similarity except Rachel, Russ & Ross. Even though you want Ross & Rachel to be together her being with Russ this episode shows she still wants to be with Ross.

1723698,5,B000068CNX,"... in my top 3 seasons of often beloved,sometimes hated but undoubtely one of the most influential tv series in 90's, Friends. There is also no weak episode in the whole bunch and those two which I consider the weakest (TOW Phoebe's Husband and TOW Five Steaks, An Eggplant) are still above average. Also this is the season where all main characters had given some kind of story arc which helped a lot in fleshing them out. We got here official start of Ross' and Rachel's relationship on one hand and Joey's and Chandler's friendship on the another, also Monica found her dream guy (one of the most appropriate recurring guest star Tom Selleck) and finally Phoebe started to look for her father during the second year. Of course, aside of this there were many other plots, main or side, which kept whole run fresh and unpredictable. Also this is the season full of guest stars which I personally don't mind excluding van Damme's cameo which I find quite embarrassing. On the opposite side stands Brooke Shields and particularly Adam Goldberg whose performance was hilarious. But the real reason why I found this year the best is that all episodes are filled with great gags, one liners, funny situations which are going hand in hand with storylines therefore are not purposeless, there is even some space for tears but never in the way you would say you're watching soap opera with laughs (that was my problem with some episodes in later seasons). So we got here more lively characters, precise scripts, really a big amount of great laughs and above all fresh main cast having fun being a part of it. All six were really enjoying portraying their characters and you'll know it. For me this is the hardest season to choose favourite eps from but those should probably be TOW Breast Milk (great western films send offs),TOW List (emotional and funny in the same time),TOW Prom Video (obvious choice, one of the most famous eps of riends ever, home video sequence and the execution of the result is perfect), TO After the Superbowl part 1 (Brooke Shields outdid herself also Marcel the monkey returns) and to round it up to five I choose TOW Dr. Ramoray Dies (Adam Goldberg is funny as hell in this one, Tom Selleck vs. David Schwimmer are great as is Dr. Ramoray's departure). I can't really say which season is the second best and which the third but because of all above I'm pretty sure I like this one the most. Nothing's perfect but this one's really close. 100 percent recommended!",1133136000,,2486,4.691075514874142
1723699,5,B000068CNX,"Season two is basically where the R&R story began. TOW Ross' New Girlfriend showed how Ross' once jealousy has now taken position inside Rachel, because when ever she sees Ross and Julie together she feels like what Ross felt when she was with Paolo. In TOW Ross Finds Out, our favorite couple finally realize how good they are together, which took a downtoll in TOW The List where Ross makes lists about all the bad things about Rachel and Julie, and Rachel accidentally reads it. For a few episodes there we thought we'd never see Ross and Rachel together, but BAM! There they are, as a happy couple! (If you want to savior these moments, don't move on to Season 3 any sooner!)

This season also shows us some of Chandler's side. TOW Heckles Dies is technically Chandler's episode where his problems and habits are revealed. He was SO stressed he called Janice! (""Janice? You called JANICE?!"" Phoebe questions to Chandler when he's at the coffeehouse) Well, Janice turns up, but with a little surprise. Later, Chandler can't stop thinking about his date's huge head.

Joey and Chandler's friendship enters some problematics when Joey decides to move into an apartment where he can live by himself, leaving Chandler on his own and missing a friend, which makes him get another roommate who turns out to be a fruit-drying-psycopath! But, all things turn out well, Chandler tricks Eddie (his replacement roommate) into thinking he doesn't live in the apartment anymore, and Joey moves back in.

Ross' discomforts toward Carol and Susan's relationship takes a absolutely unexpected turn as the two women decide to get married. Ross says he won't go, but when Carol's parents aren't willing to be a part of the wedding, Ross agrees to coming there and give Carol away.

Monica finds love in a old family friend who is 50, leaving Ross to deal with a lot. While on their dad's birthday party, Monica decides to tell her parents. Ross, terrified as he is, makes sure when the moment hits, neither of his parents have anything to throw at Richard or Monica or possibly anything they could be hit with.

The situations all wrap up and this season ends in TOW Barry and Mindy's Wedding. Rachel goes there wearing something that looks like something 'you drink where you're nauseous' and ends up giving some stupid impression. But something Barry says while she's attempting to leave while not insulting her but giving her the power to be strong and sing Copacabanna infront of the guests which was celebrated and sang along with a lot. Then finally the episode ends with Chandler waiting for his internet-mystery girlfriend who turns out to be....you watch for yourself!

This season is very good and I'd recommend you buy this dvd.",1132444800,,2724,4.822269807280514

1723713,5,B000068CNX,"It's amazing how many people will take time to write such a hateful review of a TV show.  I can understand doing it once for a single show, maybe twice, but some (Diogenes) review many of the Friends products just to insult those that do enjoy the show.  I find that those who tend not to like the show are the ones that eat alone at lunch, constantly talking about not conforming yet conform to be a typical outsider basically another form of conforming.  It is ok we all get it.  We know why you truly hate friends...its jealousy.  While you may brag that you love your life of being an intellect, not watching ""mindless dribble"" you forget to allow yourself to be entertained.  Now if friends is not your cup of tea (or coffee) then fine, don't watch, buy, or acknowledge the show.  Write a bad review of the show...who cares...good for you.  I'm sure you and your internet ""girlfriend"" can get big laughs out of it.  I know you're trying to change how people view the show, by creating a world of ""free thinkers"". You sure changed my mind. I never knew how mindless friends was and I could not be happier that I have you to think for me.

As for season 2, great season...funny moments as all have.",1124236800,,1201,4.36936936936937
1723714,4,B000068CNX,"Season Two is still not the big machine humming at full throttle, but it was evident that Jennifer Aniston and crew were definitely on the way to something big.  The writing and acting is a bit more confident than the debut season, and Chandler comes into his own in a strong supporting role.

'Mr. Heckles' emerges as one of the delightful cameos of the show, just in time to die.  We learn some basic background about several of the characters as the show's writers feel their oats.  Phoebe, for example, is from time to time tormented not only by the memory of her late mother, but also by her very much alive husband - surprise! - and father.

Joey and Chandler fight it out like good roommates do, but find a way to put the pieces back together again, leaving us all grateful that Eddie is gone for good.  Ross and Rachel find each other in a serious way.  Carol and Susan tie the knot, so we end the season as convinced as we can be that Carol is a mere sidelight and is not coming back to Ross.

Oh, and family dysfunction?  Can any group of human beings have a less promising family background, as Chandler might ask it?  The more we know about the homes that Phebes, Rachel, Chandler, and Monica come from, the more amazing it seems that these human beings can still stand erect?

Maybe that goes as far as any single element to explain the growing appeal of these six friends.  In a generation of badly gutted family experience, these six individuals pursue some semblance of normality in spite of everything, and - with a little help from their friends - look almost set to achieve it.

The patterns they seem intent on establishing for their own lives don't lead to optimism, but we sure did love them as they tried to figure stuff out.",1123286400,,1748,4.425
1723715,3,B000068CNX,"Judging by the reviews for this DVD, a lot of people have a lot of affection for the second season of Friends.  It's easy to see why - the smoldering romance between Ross and Rachel finally (!) materialises, Joey becomes a real star with a regular spot on ""Days of Our Lives,"" and Tom Sellick arrives as a semi-regular as Monica's boyfriend.  The last point is important - this season has the best guest star list of any season.  Especially notable, in addition to Sellick, are Julia Roberts as an old classmate of Chandler's and Brooke Shields as a fan stalking Joey.  The other highlight of this season is the appearance of the first flashback show (The One with the Prom Video), establishing the friendship between Rachel, Monica, and Ross in high school, when Monica was a LOT heavier than she is in the present.  Monica's ""fat suit"" is a great prop, and worth the price of admission by itself!

Unfortunately, much of the season is annoying.  It is manipulative, cloying, and artificial.  No sooner have Ross and Rachel got together then they are split up by an arbitrary and stupid plotline that stretches out over several more episodes.  This is quite aside from the fact that Ross callously tosses aside his very likeable girlfriend, which makes him mean and  unlikeable.  In fact, the whole soap-opera aspect of the first half of this season soured me on the show so much in its original run that I stopped watching it for the rest of season 2 and the entirety of season 3.

That was my loss, of course, because once the Ross-Rachel plotline resolved itself, the shows became as enjoyable and funny as those in Season 1.  So, it's worth the effort suffering through 5 or 6 painful episodes to get to the good stuff later in the season.  As for this DVD package, it's pretty thin when compared to such DVD's as The Simpsons.  There are a few extras - a couple commentaries, a couple other featurettes, but nothing spectacular.",1122422400,,1934,4.6304985337243405
1723716,5,B000068CNX,"Season 2 was the peak of the media frenzy that caused what is now known as the backlash years. They've became so overexposed with the diet coke commercials, the theme song, magazine covers everywhere. But there is no doubt that Season 2 is a strong season. This is also probably the peak of Chandler and Joey as best buds which wass one of my favorite running storylines of the series. And not o mention the much awaited Ross and Rachel hookup. Elsewhere this is also the genesis of Monica and Richard's (Tom Selleck) romance and also the start of Phoebe's storylines about her family.

Standout episodes are TOW the Ross New Girlfriend (The best season opener of the series, all three storylines were memorable, Aniston was especially good and hilarious), Tow the baby on the Bus (Kudrow, Perry, and Le blanc were all magnificent here), Tow the List (Aniston and Schwimmer were the standout here especially towards the end), Tow the Prom Video (one of my all time favorite episodes, everything about this episode screams CLASSIC), TOW Ross Finds Out (another Schwimmer and Aniston classic especially their historic first big fight and first real kiss), TOW the Two Parties, TOW Eddie Moves In, TOW Joey Moves Out (Cox was the standout here), and TOW Barry and Mindy's Wedding (probably the most low key finale of the series)

I have to talk more about TOW the Prom Video, the best episode of the season. I love that at the start it seemed like a regular episode until it reached towards the end where we know this isn't just a regular episode. This is destined to become a classic. Everything about this episode is memorable from the performances, to the one-liners (""How many cameras are actually on you?"" ""I think I'm ready for my (...) now"") to the debut of Fat Monica and Ross afro, to Chandler's bracelet to Phoebe's lobster theory and of course the fact that Ross and Rachel are officially together.

1723717,5,B000068CNX,"All of the other reviews do so much to fill in exactly what is on these discs for this season.  However there are so many other funny, funny moments that are included in these shows that i had to take a moment and fill in some of the rest of the things that are on these DVD's but not listed.

Included in these episodes are:

1. Chandler's having a ""problem with touching"" with Joey's tailor.

2. Ross feeling jealous about the breast milk and pouring some on his arm and then being unable to do anything about it takes a towel and wipes it off and storms out.

3. The funny scene from the baby on the bus where Chandler and Joey are deciding to flip for which baby to take home and Chandler says ""what kind of scary *** clowns came to your birthday parties.

4.  Ross and Julie on the phone saying ""no you hang up, no you hang up"" and Rachel, unable to take it anymore, grabs the phone from Ross and hangs up.

I was rolling on the floor laughing watching these and although the descriptions for the shows give you a lot of insight into which show you are getting, the other precious, funny moments that are included in these episodes as subplots are just unreal.  Just thought I would share with you.

1723718,5,B000068CNX,"Along with Seinfeld and Frasier, Friends dominated the must-see TV of the 1990's. Winner of innumerable television awards, the show features the lives of six friends in their late-twenties/early-thirties living in New York City - Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry).

The Friends (Season 2) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere which begins with Rachel anxiously waiting for Ross at the airport so she can tell him about her feelings. But when Ross exits the plane with his new girlfriend Julie (Lauren Tom) on his arm, Rachel struggles with what she should do. The first several episodes of the season are dominated by this storyline until (in episode #31) a drunken Rachel phones Ross and leaves a message on his answering machine revealing the truth. Forced to decide between Julie and Rachel, Ross constructs a list of pros and cons (episode #32) that Rachel inevitably finds. The incident threatens to destroy their relationship before they finally come together. Meanwhile, Joey lands a part on Days Of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Ramoray, but seals his own fate when his hubris steps on the toes of the show's writers...

The Ross/Rachel storyline receives the most attention throughout the season, however, there are many other story arcs which help make the season extremely memorable (ex: Monica and Richard, Joey getting a job on Days of our Lives, Joey moving out of the apartment, etc.).

1723730,5,B000068CNX,"""Friends"" became a bigger hit than anybody had expected it to be. After the first season, ratings were sky high. Jennifer Aniston (RACHEL GREEN), Courteney Cox Arquette (MONICA GELLAR), Lisa Kudrow (PHOEBE BUFFAY), Matt LeBlanc (JOEY TRIBBIANI), Matthew Perry (CHANDLER BING), & David Schwimmer (ROSS GELLAR) return in their hilarious second season.

Our six best friends are back in their second season. Picking up where the final episode of the first season had left off, Rachel anxiously waits at the airport for Ross, who is flying back to the states from China. Rachel is so anxious to tell him that she knows about his love for her and that she feels the same way, hoping she and Ross could start dating. But Rachel is heartbroken when she finds Ross stepping off of the plane with another woman named Julie.

For the first few episodes, Ross continues to date Julie, while Rachel angrily bickers over it. We also learn that Phoebe is secretly married to a gay Canadian ice dancer named Duncan. He only married Phoebe for his greencard. Phoebe spends time with Duncan after a night of performing. He tells Phoebe that he needs a divorce because he met someone else...a woman. Turns out that Duncan was not gay. The woman he is seeing is about to become his future wife. Also, Monica and Rachel's annoying neighbor, Mr. Heckles, who lives one floor below them, passes on. Mr. Heckles was a lonely hermit. Chandler learns that when Heckles was young, he dismissed woman that had features that just didn't sit right with him. Chandler realizes that he does the exact same thing. He calls Janice, wanting to get back together with her, wanting to make a commitment, but Janice couldn't wait around for Chandler. Janice had gotten married to the boss of Mattress King. The two have a kid on the way.

Rachel learns that her ex-fianc&eacute;, Barry, is engaged to her best friend, Mindy, who was supposed to stand as Rachel's maid of honor. Ross suddenly finds out about Rachel's feelings for him. He breaks up with Julie and hopes to date Rachel, but Chandler and Joey talk him into making up a list of pros and cons between the girls. Rachel becomes angry and then dismisses the idea of dating Ross. But she changes her mind when she and Monica watch the home video of their Senior Prom. Rachel's date practically never showed up, forcing Ross to vow to take Rachel. But when Ross comes downstairs, finally dressed. Rachel's date shows up, leaving Ross heartbroken. Feeling terrible about knowing this, Rachel decides to give the romance a chance with Ross.

Monica, with Phoebe's help, caters for a party, held by Dr. Richard Burke. Richard is an ophthalmologist, who is best friends with Monica and Ross' dad. But Richard and Monica find love in each other's eyes and the two begin a healthy relationship, despite the 25-year age difference. Joey is offered a small role on one episode of Days Of Our Lives as a cab driver, but the producers changed their minds and gave Joey the permanent role of Dr. Drake Ramoray on the same show. But Joey was killed off early, when he revealed that he changes his lines. Rachel finds out that her mother and father are getting a divorce. Sandra Green, Rachel's mother, only tells Rachel because she hoped Rachel would understand. Rachel asks her why, of all people, would she understand. Sandra reveals that, ""...You didn't marry your Barry, dear. But I married mine."" At the same time, Ross finds out that Carol and Susan want to get married. Ross is less enthused about it, but he comes to Carol's rescue when her parents decide not to show up and give her away. Ross stands in and gives Carol away.

Barry and Mindy's wedding has arrived. Mindy has requested that Rachel be her maid of honor. Rachel has no intentions of showing up, but decides to do so in order to redeem herself in front of Barry's family. Ross goes along with Rachel to the wedding, with the company of Monica and Richard. Monica talks to Richard about a future. Richard agrees with Monica until Monica brings up one little thing: children. Monica really wants children, but Richard already has two children: Timothy Burke and Michelle Burke. Richard is not up to doing it all again, forcing Monica to make the painful decision she does not want to make. They sadly break up. At that time, Chandler has an all-night online conversation with a woman, who he seems to really like. He discovers that she is married, which leaves him devastated, but his hopes are brought back up when she tells him that she's getting a divorce. They set up a meeting at the coffeehouse. Chandler's mystery internet girl is...Janice. Chandler discards Janice's annoying characteristics and develops a long-term relationship with her.

More fun is to be seen in the second season. Buy the complete second season and laugh yourself to death over again. Guest stars include: Tom Selleck, Adam Goldberg, Julia Roberts, Brook Shields, Chris Isaack, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steve Zahn, Elliott Gould, Christina Pickles, Rob Leiban, Giovanni Ribisi, Lorraine Newman, & Marlo Thomas.

I live in Hungary, and I bought the DVD in Hungarian. I love Friends, so i love the dvd. But I have a problem. In Hungary there are no extras on the dvd, and I found on the Internet that on the American DVD I can watch the Smelly Cat Video Clip, but it is NOT on my DVD.

1723734,4,B000068CNX,"The second season of ""Friends"" still provides plenty of laughs even though it veers into more conventional sitcom plotlines that it did during its first season.  There is some silliness over a list that has Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) all steamed when she should be falling in love with Ross (David Schwimmer)-just artificial drama cooked up to postpone the inevitable kiss in the hopes of making it a bigger ""ahhh"" moment.  There are also a few stereotypical situation comedy situations based on pulling off some outlandish deception that no one with an ounce of sense could possibly fall for, such as ""The One With Two Parties"" (although the writers seem to be acknowledging this when Chandler [Matthew Perry] delivers the great line: ""I wonder what Jack and Chrissie would do now?"").  Some unfortunate guest stars don't help matters.

Despite these flaws, there are some great moments as well.  Tom Selleck has a fun and touching recurring role as Monica's (Courtney Cox) older boyfriend, Dr. Richard Burke.  A story arc concerns Joey's (Matt LeBlanc) success on a soap opera and his subsequent decision to move out; Adam Goldberg has a great role as Chandler's psychotic new roommate.  ""The One With the Prom Video,"" in which Ross and Rachel finally kiss, is genuinely touching despite all the contrived shenanigans leading up to it.

Just seven more seasons to go.",1098057600,,1367,5.017699115044247

When i first got this season of friends i was new to the series, but i got into this straight away! i was laughing up until the point of tears! SO MUCH! you don't ""really"" need any introduction to friends to watch this! (except it would be good to watch the first series first, but this is not necessary.) Also the special features are good, not brillient, but pleasing. My favourite being the FULL Smelly Cat Video after the quiz! its soooo halarious! This dvd version of Friends Season 2 has never before seen footage so, even if you have seen the eps. its worth getting!
If you haven't seen them its a gret intro. so my conclusion get it NOW!

It shows you how people from culturally diverse backgrounds can get along and live together, not like most tv shows where they'd have you believe everyone in the world (let alone big cities like New York) is white.  Also I like it when the Friends go to events, concerts, new restaurants, ethnic festivals, etc., and really explore the city and world around them.  Not like most shows where the main characters just sit around the same place and talk.  How boring, right!?
Friends is truly an enlightening revelation in the tv world!!!
So get Friends Season Whatever on dvd now!!!",1078790400,,603,4.769230769230769
1723738,5,B000068CNX,"The FRIENDS have done it again! They're back in Season Two with even more surprises!!! The season starts off with ""The One With Ross' New Girlfriend"", which sadly, isn't Rachel. It picks up as in last season, where Rachel was going to the airport to meet Ross after his trip from China, to tell him of her feelings, which was something ROSS shouldda done LAST season!
Anyway, Ross comes home with Julie, an old college friend in charge of the dinosaur dig in China, which leaves Rachel in a pissed-off-awe.
In season two, more deep secerts are revealed on Ross and Rachel's past, we find out Phoebe has a husband, perfect Monica gets fired from her job, Joey drinks breast milk, Chandler gets a new roomie, and many more other events occur in The Compete Second Season of Friends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1076284800,,808,4.820143884892087
1723739,5,B000068CNX,"i got introduced to friends through the dvd box sets, and it's been a pleasure to watch them in order, with the full episode included, uncut. certain lines or parts of scenes are cut out on tv, so if you're a die-hard fan, having the episodes on dvd can be preferable.
i'm liking the third season better than second right now, but that's only a personal preference. there are some classic episodes included on this set - lots of ross and rachel, joey's first big role as drake ramoray on days of our lives, joey moving out of the apartment with chandler, and monica's relationship with an older man, richard. being that chandler and phoebe are my favorite characters, i missed their involvement a bit, but they got subplots.
highlights: ross and rachel 'you-knowing' in the planetarium part of the museum where ross works, phoebe's ""smelly cat"", ross making a list about rachel, monica's character developing as she grows closer to richard, chandler finding an internet girl who turns out to be janice, all the tension between ross rachel and julie, etc.
lowlights: something about the episodes where eddie moved in seemed less well written and a little tedious. maybe it was just the fact that i was sick when I was watching them. *g* the fact that there are no chapters in episodes themselves, as others have mentioned, is a drawback. should have commentary from the six main character actors themselves; other shows do! deleted scenes would be nice; some of the special features seem useless, like showing a short clip of each guest actor when if you just watch the episodes, you have the whole thing. being able to check out monica and rachel's apartment in detail was kind of cool, though. and the quiz game was fun. if you get it wrong, it shows a clip of one of the characters shouting ""no!"", which i thought was incredibly clever and funny.
that's all i can think of off the top of my head; i'm at work and can't check the dvds for specifics. :)",1073174400,,1953,4.631123919308357
1723740,5,B000068CNX,"I am still not at the point where I can recognize the bonus footage included in ""Friends: The Complete Second Season"" on DVD, but I can tell that the second season was an overall improvement on the first, despite the fact that the series did not put its best foot forward with ""The One After the Super Bowl Pars 1 & 2"" (thumbs up on Julia Roberts, both thumbs down on Brooke Shields and Jean-Claude Van Damme).  Obviously getting Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) to the point where they would actually kiss was a key dynamic, but what made this a better season was that Monica (Courtney Cox) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc), the two weakest characters in the first season, were finally given something to do.  For Monica it was a romance with Dr. Richard Burke (Tom Selleck), the old friend of the family, while Joey landed the unforgettable part of Dr. Drake Ramoray on ""Days of Our Lives"" and actually moves out of the apartment with Chandler.  Chandler (Matthew Perry) continues to crack jokes to ease all the pain in his life and Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) sings ""Smelly Cat"" for the first time, but even as background for most of these episodes they both steal their share of scenes.
Best episodes from the Second Season: ""The One with Ross' New Girlfriend,"" but because Phoebe gives Monica the wrong ""Moore"" style hair cut (Dudley instead of Demi) more than Rachel discovering Ross is now with Julie the paleontologist; ""The One Were Heckles Dies,"" not only because the girl inherit his junk, but because Phoebe goes toe to toe with Ross on evolution; ""The One With Ross Finds Out,"" where Rachel protests too much about being ""over"" Ross; ""The One with the Prom Video"" and the killer moment when Rachel finds out what she did not know way back when and discovers Ross is her ""lobster""; ""The One Where Eddie Moves In,"" where Adam Goldberg moves into Chandler's apartment and provides the best guest starring role of the season (plus the ""Smelly Cat"" video); ""The One Where Old Yeller Dies"" and Phoebe finds out why her moment never let her seen the end of the famous Disney doggie snuff film; ""The One with the Bullies,"" where Chandler and Ross go to toe to toe with a couple of bullies over the couch at Central Perk; and ""The One with Barry & Mindy's Wedding,"" where the focus might be on Rachel as maid of honor at her ex-fiance's wedding, but the pivotal point is Monica and Richard breaking up over the subject of children (cross apply the irony and poignancy to this season's adoption plot line forced by Arquette's real world problems conceiving: is there anyone on the planet that more people would like to see pregnant?).
If the first season was a 4.0, then the second gets ""Friends"" up to 4.5.  The justification for rounding up is the payoff to ""The One with the Prom Video"" (the kiss and not what Monica discovers her parents had put on the end of the videotape).  ""TV Guide"" listed that as one of the Top 100 moments in television history, and it was not until Chandler's proposal to Monica turned out to really be a surprise that the series topped this one.  If only Ross and Rachel did not go ""on a break"" during the next season, then things might have turned out differently.",1072483200,,3202,4.589160839160839
1723741,5,B000068CNX,"After a phenomenal debut season like Friends,most shows coast on it's success and start to slip in quality. But Friends would only get better with each successive season.
 Changes were in the air for the group. Joey joined the cast of Days Of Our Lives as the ill fated Dr. Drake Ramoray,we meet Phoebe's ex husband (Steve Zahn),Chandler gets a new roommate(Adam Goldberg)who turns out to be a psycho,and Monica falls in love with her dad's best friend Dr. Richard Burke(Tom Selleck).The seasons driving force is the beginning of the on/off again relationship between Rachel and Ross.
 Many classic episodes came from this season including The One where Heckles Dies,...the Baby on the Bus,...where Ross Finds Out,...the List,...where Ross and Rachel ... You Know,...where Dr. Ramoray Dies and ...Two Parties.
 But also from season two was The One With The Prom Video,considered the greatest Friends episode ever. Not only are we treated to a plot involving a hidious bracelet Joey gives to Chandler,but an old video of Rachel and Monica's prom. Giving a glimpse into to past at an overwieght Monica,a pre-nose job Rachel,and an extremely dorky Ross(""Looking Good Mr. Kotter).The most surprising moment is after viewing the video and Rachel seeing how much Ross really loved her,she finally kisses him(his Lobster) one of those special moments why Friends beloved by it's many fans.",1067990400,,1382,5.160714285714286

In this season, Ross and Rachel become a couple, but it wasn't easy for them to get there.  At the beginning of this season, Ross meets a woman named Julie, who is his girlfriend for the first couple of months and Rachel shows her jealously throughout Ross and Julie's relationship.  Ross breaks up with Julie when he discovers that Rachel has feelings for him.  But Ross does something that angers Rachel to the very core of her being; he makes a list that compares her and Julie.  Rachel finds out about the list and blows off Ross for a couple of months.  Then Rachel views a video of her and Monica going to senior prom.  Rachel's date is late, so Monica's father suggests Ross take Rachel to the prom.  Ross didn't think it was a very good idea, but he goes along with it anyways.  But, when Ross is upstairs getting ready, Rachel's date shows up, leaving Ross heartbroken.  Rachel never knew about this until she sees the prom video.  As soon as the video is over, Rachel kisses Ross and they finally become a couple.  This is also the season where Monica meets and falls in love with the man of her dreams.  But their romance is short-lived due to a serious matter.  This is defintely a great DVD to add to your Friends collection.  Hope you enjoy!!",1066003200,,1420,4.48828125

Friends is a unique show in that even when they have an episode that [stinks] compared to other Friends episodes, it is great compared to other shows.  I can say that I have never seen an episode I did not find enjoyable, especially this season. Joey moving out and eventually moving back in provide 3 hilarious episodes with Eddy, Chandlers new roommate.

It's the journey through these six characters that makes it so interesting to watch because we can all relate to one or more of them.

The inclusion of a trivia game, which for some reason I won against my wife's knowledge of the shows, is illustrated by going back to clips from the shows in question.  It also has the Smelly Cat video, which originally was partially used in the episode where Phoebe is signed to a record deal, but is not so great.  The episodes, however, are.  This collection of one of the early years of Friends is completely enjoyable,a nd compares well to the top-rated shows that have come in the last two years.

Also it'a a bit difficult to find the extra features on these DVDs, since they don't say which features are on which DVDs, you have to either memorize it, write it down or just swap discs until you find what you're looking for.

the dvd's are also put together well.  for example, there's a ""play episodes"" option on the main menu that runs thru all the episodes on the disc without interruption, and only playing the theme song on the first one - very smart!  some other dvd collections i have watched could learn a great deal from the friends people.

Season One's cliffhanger where Rachel finds out Ross' feelings for her and she goes to the airport to meet him on his way back from China is dealt with beautifully.  It seems that Ross has met a former college associate, Julie, in China and they are an item.  The tables are now turned as it is Rachel who is secretly pining for an unknowing Ross.  This is a brilliant move and the humor in the situation is mined for the first few episodes.  Ross finds out about Rachel's feelings for him when he retrieves a phone message that a drunken Rachel left for him claiming she's over him.  They fight over this, but in the end, Ross knocks on Central Perk's door in a rainstorm for their first kiss.  The road to love isn't smooth as Rachel finds a pros and cons list Ross has made about her and Julie, but after seeing an old video of Monica and hers prom night in which Ross was going to stand in as a date for Rachel where her boyfriend was thought to be ditching her (this is a classic episode and in the video we see a fat Monica, a pre nose job Rachel and Ross has jeri curled hair and cheesy mustache).  The Ross & Rachel relationship of course dominates the season, but there are many other hilarious subplots including Joey getting his big break as a soap actor in Days Of Our Lives which leads to him moving out of the apartment and Chandler getting a new roommate Eddie (played brilliantly by the underrated Adam Goldberg) who at first seems perfect, but turns out to be psychotic.  Also, Monica starts her relationship with Dr. Richard Burke (Tom Selleck, who shows a rare comedic side).

Like the first season's look into Central Perk, there is an interactive view of Monica and Rachel's apartment. There is a quiz on how well you know your Friends and after completing the quiz, Phoebe's Smelly Cat music video plays. There is Friends of Friends which shows clips of guest stars that appeared during season 2. A new feature is What's Up With Your Friends? This shows clips of each of the main six characters.

The factors of no commercials, extra footage seamlessly edited into all the episodes and some special features added to all the great episodes of season two are enough to make any Friends fan buy this collection.",1031097600,,1164,4.655339805825243

1723785,5,B000068CNX,"I'm really curious and I really want to see what is different and added on this DVD.
I live in Europe and all the episodes (not uncut) which were shown on TV were released on VHS and DVD, so I've seen all the episodes from every season including season 8 about too many times and I'm a really big fan of the show. Unfortunately, I can't play an American DVD (region 1) on my DVD player so I'll have to watch my Friends collection again and I'll probably never know how the new DVD is like with all the special features and uncut scenes. But I'm sure that season two (and season one) will be very good because Friends is the best sitcom ever! It really [stinks] that you had to wait 8 years for this but I'm sure that it will be worth waiting for!
And a little message for Andy Radke: Your list with all the episodes of season two is not completely correct, you switched the last two episodes, TOW The Chicken Pox is episode 23 and TOW Barry and Mindy's Wedding is episode 24...
I can only imagine how it will be but I'm sure it's going to be really good. So all you Friends fans: enjoy it, it's going to be great!",1024358400,,1113,4.1336405529953915

1723787,5,B000068CNX,"With 8 great seasons in the can with the 9th (and possibly final) season on the way, it's hard to disagree that ""Friends"" was, and is one of the most innovative shows to grace prime time television.
With the stellar ensemble cast we've all come to know and love (consisting of Courtney Cox-Arquette, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, and Matt LeBlanc), not to mention excellent storylines brought to us by the show's very talented writers, it's clear why this show remains the top prime time sitcom to date.
This set will feature all 24 episodes from the second season.  All uncut and commercial free.  Like the first, each episode will feature additional ""never-before-seen"" footage.
Season one was indeed jam-packed with special features and this set will indeed be no exception.  With interesting tidbits and trivia about the show, not to mention optional commentary, it really is hard to complain.  In my opinion, the episodes themselves make this set a value in itself.
I have compiled a list of all the episodes you will see in this season 2 set (in chronological order).
1.  THE ONE WITH ROSS' NEW GIRLFRIEND
2.  THE ONE WITH THE BREAST MILK
3.  THE ONE WHERE MR. HECKLES DIES

5.  THE ONE WITH PHOEBE'S HUSBAND
6.  THE ONE WITH THE BABY ON THE BUS
7.  THE ONE WHERE ROSS FINDS OUT
8.  THE ONE WITH THE LIST
9.  THE ONE WITH PHOEBE'S DAD
10. THE ONE WITH THE PROM VIDEO
11. THE ONE WITH RUSS
12. THE ONE WITH THE LESBIAN WEDDING
13. THE ONE AFTER THE SUPERBOWL PART I
14. THE ONE AFTER THE SUPERBOWL PART II
15. THE ONE WHERE ROSS AND RACHEL....YOU KNOW
16. THE ONE WHERE JOEY MOVES OUT
17. THE ONE WHERE EDDIE MOVES IN

24. THE ONE WITH THE CHICKEN POX
There you have it.  ""Friends"" has become a show that, even in syndication still remains hilarious.  Anyhow, if you enjoyed the first season DVD set, there is no doubt in my mind that you'll love this as well.  And for those of you who are unfamiliar with the older episodes (as I once was), then grab these sets and prepare to laugh.",1023753600,,2277,4.411483253588517

1723789,4,B000068CNX,"After the success of the first season on DVD, we could only expect this to be announced as quickly as possible by Warner Home Video.  The second season of ""Friends"" was brought to viewers with a settled pre-existing foundation.  The first season developed each character inch-by-inch until we were ready to root for Ross and Rachel to get together.  In a wonderfully conceived cliffhanger to season one we were left questioning the outcome to Rachel's bold move at the airport.
When season two picked up, we found out that Ross was going to be a tougher catch than Rachel thought.  This made for quality television when Rachel began to flirt with Ross in blatant attempt at winning his affection.  Once Rachel accidently announces to Ross that she has fallen for him, he is presented with the incredibly difficult decision between Julie and Rachel.  He's had a crush on Rachel since high school, but he's gotten serious with Julie.  That too is accompanied by good writing and classic moments in the ""Friends"" (and ""Mad About You"") universe.  For all fans of ""Friends"", we've known for years how these predicaments turn out, and we also anticipate the eventual relationship between Ross and Rachel in this season.
This season is full of quotable dialogue and memorable situations.  It easily ranks up there as one of the best ""Friends"" seasons.  The first one started it all, and we are forever in the creators' debt for that, but as the series progressed so did the writing and the actors' performances.
This season houses many classic escapades such as when we find out that Phoebe is married to a Canadian ice skater (who she once thought was gay), when Ross finds out about Rachel's reciprical desire when she says, ""I'm over you""(in which he replies, ""You're over me?  When were you under me?""), the hilarious prom video that reflects on the Geller's past (and proves to Rachel that Ross has always felt something for her), the star-studded two-parter that aired around the superbowl(featuring Brooke Shields, Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Julia Roberts), when Monica starts dating Richard (played by Tom Selick), and when Joey moves out and is replaced by the annoying and potentially psychotic roommate Eddie.
It's all here, and complemented by some nice looking extras.  The two commentary tracks will definitely provide us with anecdotes up the wazoo and the tour of Monica and Rachel's apartment will be just as informative as was the tour of Central Perk on the season one DVD.  On top of that, you get every episode in their uncut form.
I'm an assured fan of ""Friends"" and am eagerly awaiting this box-set, which arrives on September 3rd.  If you enjoyed the first season on DVD, I suggest you reserve a copy of ""Friends - The Complete Second Season"" now.  For anyone who hasn't seen the second season of ""Friends"" before during its television run, this won't disappoint.",1022544000,,2880,4.885010266940451
