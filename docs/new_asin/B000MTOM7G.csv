8172326,5,B000MTOM7G,"These episodes are some of the best in the series. I absolutely love the fight with the Toguro brothers. The acting by Justin Cook is fantastic. He has this yell that is so badass, I love it. I won't give away any plot detail, but let me tell you, stuff goes down. The fights are so awesome, I can't even begin to explain.

Once again, the quality is good for these DVDs. Cheap, but they come with good video and sound. Missing some bonus features, but still great. If you're doubtful about Yu Yu Hakusho, watch a few of these episodes, and you'll be blown away.",1342742400,,562,4.30188679245283
8172327,4,B000MTOM7G,"The longest and most savage arc of the ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" series comes to an end.... just in time for our heroes to get blindsided by a brand new threat to the world. Ah, fun.

And ""Yu Yu Hakusho: Five Standing"" is pretty much packed with entertainment, with the the end of the Dark Tournament Arc is all hardcore, bloody action and quite a bit of pathos. And as soon as that is over, it follows with a bizarre trio of episodes that lead into a darker, more twisted storyline. If only it hadn't ended right there!

Kurama barely triumphs in his duel with Karasu, until a replay reveals that he lost the point anyway. So it falls to Hiei to fight the monstrously powerful Bui with his newly retrained Dragon of the Darkness Flame, shattering the stadium and threatening to destroy everyone around him. And Kuwabara goes up against the grotesque, unkillable Elder Toguro -- who drives him into a rage with the revelation of Genkai's death.

Then there's the duel everyone's been waiting for -- Yusuke and Younger Toguro. And though Yusuke's training has given him immense new powers, he still can't beat his demonic opponent. But then a familiar voice tells Toguro the secret to unlocking Yusuke's power -- kill one of his friends. And when Toguro seemingly murders a helpless Kuwabara, Yusuke's rage and grief cause his power to skyrocket -- but will it be enough to defeat Toguro's 100%?

Then there's the aftermath of the battle. The team thinks back on the person they all miss, and in the Spirit World, Genkai has a final encounter with Toguro -- revealing his true motives.

But no sooner have the teammates returned home than Yusuke is kidnapped by a trio of teenage psychics, who are keeping him in the bizarre House of Four Dimensions. To rescue him, his friends must deal with the psychics' ""territories"" -- zones of altered reality -- and one of them is a genius with a grudge against Kurama. And even if the foxy youth can outwit his rival, there are still obstacles to overcome -- and secrets to reveal.

The ending of the Dark Tournament is a pretty solid one -- lots of fiery black dragons, dismemberment, Toguro's gross green muscles, and a stadium that finally collapses. It's quite a credit that after dozens of fight scenes, this series still manages to amp up the voltage for the final round of fights, and delivers a few shocking twists along the way.

The big problems: a certain dead character fails to stay that way, and Toguro and Yusuke's battle is kind of anticlimactic after Hiei's literally earthshattering duel and Kuwabara's inspired attack on elder Toguro. That, and this two-disk set ends on a MASSIVE cliffhanger -- as soon as you find out what's going on, it ends.

But fortunately there's a certain freshness to the beginning of the next arc, which  starts off on a rather lighthearted note (""I'd rather not explain to your teacher why I can fly""), but it begins to darken when resident genius Kurama has to psychologically outwit a classmate in a jungle room where most sounds cannot be uttered. When the reason for all this craziness is revealed, it's obvious that ""Yu Yu Hakusho's"" story is about to grow far more horrific.

And fortunately the stories are still liberally speckled with humor, including Kuwabara's happy victory dance and Hiei's tumble out of a tree (""What repulsive creature makes my ears bleed?!""). But the most hilarious scene involves the composed, dignified Kurama screaming ""BAAAAAAAAA!"" behind his jealous classmate, and pulling a funny face. No, we do not get to see it -- which makes it even funnier.

Yusuke has a lot of growth in this season, and not all of it is good -- sometimes he seems deeply overconfident and rather obnoxious -- particularly after his victory -- but he also shows a great deal of caring for his friends. His biggest rival and opponent Toguro is also revealed to be not quite the pure evil creature that he seemed to be. Still a bad guy, but one you feel sorry for.

And Kurama gets to show his intellect in a series of psychological games with a snotty psychic classmate, while Hiei turns out to have plenty of power and the ""abandon"" to use it, but also an ill-used ego to match. And Kuwabara again proves that he's a lot cleverer than he looks, giving Yusuke the final push to victory in the Dark Tournament, and helping charge through the House of Four Dimensions.

Poor Yusuke and friends. No sooner have they dealt with the Dark Tournament than a new problem arises in ""Yu Yu Hakusho: Five Standing."" The mayhem just never ends.",1220832000,,4519,4.67632241813602

8172329,5,B000MTOM7G,"Here is the part where Taguro was defeated by Yusuke, the Spirit Detective. You won't able to leave your seat. How Genkai come back and test Yusuke and his group. And a new case is waiting for Yusuke to solve. Another hard and interesting case, of course.

8172330,5,B000MTOM7G,"In Yu Yu Hakusho: Five Standing, you will receive 14 terrific episodes of the show on two DVDs. Specifically, these are episode 57 upto and including 70. If you haven't seen the episodes before these, go watch them or my review may confuse you.

Kurama has won his match over Karasu in the first fight of the Dark Tournament's final round. However, a corrupt ruling gives the dead Karasu the win. For the first time in its history, the Dark Tournament has had a winner who has died and a loser who has lived. Next, Hiei faces the mysterious Bui. This short but interesting fight reveals what Bui sounds like and looks like beneath his armor. Hiei uses the Dragon of the Darkness Flame, only to have it thrown back at him! Can Hiei triumph over the powerful Bui?

Next, a fearful Kuwabara must face the Elder Toguro brother. Elder Toguro reveals to Kuwabara that Genkai has died in a cruel and sadistic way. Enraged, Kuwabara uses new abilities to face Toguro, but Toguro reveals a devastating ability of his own! Toguro can move any part of his body to anywhere else on his body, and only piercing his heart or brain can actually kill him! How can Kuwabara triumph over a seemingly immortal foe?

Next, Yusuke faces Younger Toguro in the Tournament's final battle. Toguro has waited 30 episodes for his rematch, now the two warriors must hold nothing back. Who will triumph? The final battle has wonderful images, and leaves you wanting even more. As the fight nears its end, Yusuke may have to lose another one of his friends before finally putting Toguro to rest.

After the Tournament, a victorious Team Urameshi reflects on their journey, but who has survived? In Spirit World, some new information on Younger Toguro as well as a meeting with Genkai sheds new light on the ""villain"" and gives us a deeper look into his personality, desires, and wishes.

The last four episodes of the set deal with the upcoming Chapter Black or Sensui Saga. I'll save my review of that saga for the next set, all you need to know now is that Sakyo's plan hasn't died with him, and strange things have been happening while Yusuke's been away... Still, the Dark Tournament's Final Round and its aftermath are the main focuses of this set.

This set left me with a bag of mixed emotions. The episodes are terrific and are for a great price, but the extras stink. In my opinion, a show needs a truly evil villain to be great. One that has no goodness and one you love to hate. However, by the time this volume ends, you end up feeling sorry for Younger Toguro. You gain a new appreciation for his deep level of intelligence and his ability to plan things months before they happen. However in the end, it seems that Toguro was only looking for someone to finally end his miserable life, a life made miserable due to a terrible choice he made many years ago. In truth, Yusuke is his savior and as such, by the end of the Dark Tournament you feel cheated out of having a great villain. Younger Toguro wasn't as evil as he appeared, not by a long shot. Elder Toguro fit the role of a villain MUCH better than his brother did! You'll see this problem again with Sensui, but I'll save that for later. Still...whatever you think of both the Toguros is left up for you to decide. This volume is still wonderful and recommended for any fan of Yu Yu Hakusho, or anime in general. Overall 14 terrific episodes of a wonderful series.",1180915200,3,3405,4.51948051948052
