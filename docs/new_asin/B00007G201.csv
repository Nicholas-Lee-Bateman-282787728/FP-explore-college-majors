1809561,4,B00007G201,"To comment on The quest for lost tombs ...

I would give this piece a good 4 stars. It is at a disadvantage because it doesn't have the ''whiz-bang'' of a lot of documentaries today. There are no awesome oceans, extreme cliffs, or radial shots of tremendous landscapes ... No, it is a normal documentary, about, more or less, recent archeological finds in Egypt.

It is not just a quest for lost tombs ... A search exists, but it is more a quest for a backdoor into sources of artifacts from life in ancient egypt.

I found it interesting. As most of the big tombs were looted, they are finding tombs of lesser-known figures, whose gravesites were less conspicuous, and subsequently, less-likely to have been looted over the years. It tells that story, of course, in a more detailed and engaging fashion.

If you have kids, between 8 and 14 years old, this kind of thing is great. It is intellectually stimulating, because it shows the complexity of this search. It visually supports the topic, and it is not too complex or obscure. I would also say, if you are a history teacher, get it so that you have to explain less. If a picture is worth 1,000 words, damn, imagine the value of an entire video!",1122336000,36,1200,4.516129032258065

7976252,5,B00007G201,"This video has a good mix of ancient information and archeological education as well.  It goes into detail about how thieves robbed the tombs.  I am not particularly fond of World Civ, but found this video to be interesing enough to keep my attention.  I have posted a video viewing guide for this video on the teacherspayteachers website if you are interested in using it in your classroom.  Nothing objectionable for students as young as middle school.",1348358400,4,454,4.857142857142857

7976254,1,B00007G201,"I had to give this product the lowest rating because the disc within the packaging for ""Egypt Eternal - The Quest for Lost Tombs"" was in fact the disc for another National Geographic DVD, ""Egypt: Quest for Eternity.""  I had also ordered and received ""Egypt: Quest for Eternity"" at the same time and ended up with two identical discs.  I hope National Geographic discovers and corrects the error.",1186012800,5,395,4.794117647058823
