1404273,2,B000058TID,"Saturday the 14th (Howard R. Cohen, 1981)
Veteran Hollywood screenwriter Howard Cohen (Deathstalker, Stryker, Vampire Nurses, and-- I'm not kidding-- Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealers) tookhis first whack at directing with this insanely silly send-up of seventies horror flicks. How a guy who writes B-grade fantasy and softcore flicks managed to assemble the cast he got for this film is beyond me, but to his credit, the cast did manage to pull off something that didn't completely wreck their careers.
Waldemar (veteran character actor Jeffrey Tambor, in his second big-screen role) and Yolanda (the late Nancy Andrews, in her last film role) are very interested in buying a dilapidated old house. Problem is, its owner has just died and left it, in his will, to an all-American family: father John (Richard Benjamin, recently seen in the TNT production of The Goodbye Girl), mother Mary (seventies film and TV staple Paula Prentiss), nubile daughter Debbie (Kari Michaelsen of Gimme a Break!), and credulous kid brother Billy (Kevin Brando, for a while the voice of Charlie Brown). Billy finds the book Waldemar and Yolanda are after, opens and reads it, and lets out all manner of evil creatures, making no one happy. John hires an exterminator to get rid of some pests, and finds himself stuck with Van Helsing (the late, great Severn Darden), an exterminator who is more than he appears to be...
yeah, okay, it's funny. Kind of. In the same incredibly stupid way that Dark Star is funny, but without the ability and talent both in front of and behind the camera to be found in Dark Star. (And without the beach ball with claws, an unforgivable omission.) Kari Michaelsen's obligatory ""nubile daughter taking a bath"" scene is worth the price of admission, if you're into that sort of thing, and there are a few chuckles here and there. But for the most part, it kicked my nostalgia trip between the legs a few times. This one just plain doesn't hold up well, and I wonder what I was thinking back in the day when I watched it about a hundred times on HBO. (No, I know what I was thinking. Kari Michaelsen taking a bath.) **",1076976000,7,2131,4.777777777777778
1404274,4,B000058TID,"I saw Sautrday the 14th when I was a teen, I'm not sure though if I saw it in a movie theater or on cable on a movie channel. This was a funny movie that spoofed horror movies. Richard Benjamin and Paula Prentiss who are married in real life play a couple who move with their son Billy and daughter Debbie into a haunted  house. I would like to have this movie on DVD but there isn't really any info on if it's available in widescreen, I would hate to buy it and find out it's an edited pan and scan DVD.",1066694400,,504,3.9411764705882355
1404275,5,B000058TID,"Not scary at all, but quite fun, Saturday the 14th includes ALL the cliches, from the family (a banal, witty father, an equally banal Mrs. Cleaver mother, a cute teenaged daughter who is just destined for mauling, and a super-smart 10-year-old son) to their newly inherited ""house with a curse"". The house is as much fun to watch as the characters living in it, with moving-eye portraits, sentient (and carnivorous) bookcases, candles that mysteriously light themselves when light switches are thrown, and a Dark-Shadows-meets-Brady-Bunch decorating scheme.
A pair of gothy-looking married vampires are trying desperately to get into the house to retrieve a book, which the boy inadvertently opens to release many evil things into the world. A nutcase exterminator (hired to get bats out of the belfry) seeks to find the book as well, and to foil the vampires. Somewhere along the way there's a house-warming party with a houseful of detestable guests (and the daughter wears a VERY 80s Gunne Sax dress, a cute touch), most of whom deserve everything that happens to them.
The monsters are of the latex suit variety and there's mild violence, but nothing here is meant to terrify. It is a parody, short and sweet, with many fun little comedic touches (the TV *only* gets ""The Twilight Zone""). Everything you think will happen does happen, right down to the bathtub scene with the teenaged daughter. The acting isn't fabulous, but the casting is good. I'm still trying to figure out if that pizza delivery boy is played by Adam Sandler in a pseudonym. Definitely this is a fun movie to have, and I've already worn out my VHS edition, which is why I've gotten a DVD edition. Incidentally, the DVD includes a few little goodies -- bios of some of the actors and staff (the producer's bio is a hoot -- it's HUMONGOUS), and trailers of various movies the same studio has done including this one.",1020124800,19,1890,4.854489164086687
1404276,5,B000058TID,"I originally watch this movie on one of the cable channel (HBO, Showtime, etc)when I was sick in bed. I thought well this is going to be a stupid movie but; it turned out to be a great movie spoofing all the old horror classics (Dracula, The Mummy, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, etc.). If you like movie spoofs this is definately worth buying for your collection. I bought a DVD of a fairly recent horror spoof that was the dumbest scarey movie I had ever seen. Thank goodness I got it really cheap and now I know why. Saturday the 14th is a classic and one of my all time favorite movies. It's right up there with all of the disaster movie spoofs on and all of the police movie spoofs. Don't just sit there reading this review. BUY IT NOW!",1002931200,8,746,4.223776223776224
1404277,4,B000058TID,"Unlike some of extrodinarily expensive spoofs of today that ganish very few to no laughs, and can only be seen by (and basically understood by) the adult population, this movie was really enjoyable.  Sure the movie may look like a low budget never was, but it was one of the more honest movies of its day.  This movie was designed to be fun (even suitable for the whole family), not to make millions and bore the audience with site gags and sexually lude or crude jokes (that only the person who wrote the movie understands) that have been used time and time again.  I think that the actors played their parts very well, and some of the monster designs were amusing.  People who only like movies with big budget special effects, and hughely popular stars will probably not enjoy this movie.  But for someone who just wants an honest movie with laugh and (believe it or not) an understandable (yet silly) plot will enjoy this movie.",1000166400,12,931,4.5843373493975905
1404278,4,B000058TID,"Years ago, I actually saw this movie in a theatre, so when I heard that it was available on DVD I was pleased! Like the more recent ""Scary Movie,"" ""Saturday the 14th"" parodies the more popular genre flicks of it's day. Everything from the Halloween films to Poltergeist to Gremlins gets a treatment here, to varying degrees of success. Some of the jokes are better than others, but unlike ""Scary Movie,"" none of the humor is graphicly sexual or overtly gross. I prefer it for that reason, but you may disagree- either way, it's fun and more suited to an ""all ages"" viewing. And I found that the jokes in ""Saturday the 14"" roll by faster, and make the poorer puns and sight gags easier to take. Best of all, the DVD is a bargan (costing almost what my brother and I paid to see it when it had it's theatrical run). The only DVD downside is that you don't get any decent extras, like deleted scenes or behind the scenes footage, most likely because the movie was made quick and cheap. Overall, I would recomend ""Saturday the 14th,"" especially if you like B movies to begin with.",985996800,46,1076,4.4393939393939394

If you want a good 1980's horror-comedy, look up Student Bodies or Hysterical!, they are both good. This one, not so much. Maybe it was good for folks growing up in the 80's, maybe the jokes played better back then. Today, this movie falls flat on it's face.",1484611200,,546,4.415841584158416

You need to be ready for silly nonsense and lots of bad one liners and bad  costumes on the monsters and the acting is strained at best. But getting a spoof movie called Saturday the 14th, you should already have an idea going in what to expect. I did chuckle now and then, but I never outright laughed.

1404323,1,B000058TID,"Saturday the 14th, a film, a spoof based on classic Horror films
written & Directed by Howard Cohen but produced by Julie corman, the wife of Roger corman
the film was released through New world pictures (Roger corman's company) back in 1981

Good spoof on the classic Horror films, comedy mixed with some Horror
some scenes are very funny and some are just plain stupid & silly
elements of Vampirism, Dracula, Creature from the black Lagoon and other classic Monsters from the Horror Genre
are shown in this Horror spoof
Waldemar who's a vampire in a Dracula outfit played by Actor Jeffrey Tambor
& his vampire wife Yolanda try desperatly to get inside an old rundown house because it contains a book of evil
this rundown house has just been inhabited by an American family
real life couple Actors Richard benjamin & Paula prentiss play the married couple in the film
along with their 2 children
very funny storyline, Richard benjamin just plays his Character straight through out the whole film
 while his son in the film tries to tell him there's monsters in the house

unfortunately this is one of Roger corman's low budget horror's that has not been given the respect it deserves
already Shout factory own the rights to most of Roger corman's films that have been released on blu-ray now
except for saturday the 14th
mainly cause the film is a Julie corman production, not Roger's
but the film was released through Roger's company thou so Roger should have some Decision if the film
should be re-released on DVD or Blu-ray
it's only been released on DVD once back in 2001 by new concorde home ent' in 1:33:1 Full screen format
i must say thou the picture quality has been cleaned a bit for DVD much clearer quality on DVD for sure
better than VHS quality anyway
so the DVD is still very much watchable in 1:33:1 fullscreen ratio

hopefully one day the film will get a widescreen DVD or blu-ray release
with retrospective interviews with Richard benjamin & Paula prentiss
but you can only hope so don't hold your breath
the film deserves maybe 3-4stars
but 1 star for this DVD release mainly cause of the poor screen ratio & ofcourse no new extras.",1423699200,3,2152,4.670184696569921

1404335,3,B000058TID,"Yep, Saturday the 14th, what can you say about such a film? It's... weird. It's strange. It's supposed to be a horror film parody, I guess, but I have no idea what horror film or films it is parodying. I mean, one can make connections, but it's not really ""like"" any of them. I'm getting ahead of myself a bit here though. Let me give you a quick synopsis.

A typical, American family inherits a very creepy old house. In the house, their ten-year-old son, Billy, finds a book: The Book of Evil. As he turns the pages of the book, the monsters illustrated within come to life inside the old house and begin terrorizing the family and anyone else who comes close. Meanwhile, a couple of other parties are after the book and soon make themselves known. One is a vampire couple, Waldemar and Yolanda, who seem to have sinister plans for it. The other is a Mr. Van Helsing, sent over by an extermination company after a call of bats in the attic, but who has really just been searching for the book in one house after another all along. Van Helsing makes a plan with the family to expel the monsters from the old house on the night of a housewarming party they are throwing on Saturday the 14th, the one day of the year that's WORSE than Friday the 13th!

That's the story, and as cheesy as it sounds, that will in no way prepare you for the cheesiness of the actual film. The camp factor is so high here! But, that's really the only thing that makes it... kinda work. The movie is funny, but often in that anti-comedy, Tim and Eric sorta way. What I mean is, even the all-American family just acts so strange. Well, not the kids so much, but the parents, yeah, they're weird. Sometimes just corny, but sometimes just VERY weird. But, it works a lot better than it did in ""My Boyfriend's Back"" (that attempt at parents who were so weird they were funny was just awful). Richard Benjamin, who plays John, the father, is just so great that he pulls it off. As much as I love Jeffrey Tambor (Waldemar), the two actors that carry this film are Benjamin and Kari Michaelsen, the latter largely being there for the teenage girl eye-candy factor, but also providing a connection to the audience, since she might be the most normal character in the film. Severn Darden also gets some laughs as Van Helsing, and Benjamin's real-life wife, Paula Prentiss as the mom, has her moments but is not as memorable as the others. The monsters are cheesy, Land of the Lost type stuff, and the highlight of the whole film is Kari Michaelsen's bath scene. I remember her getting progressively, frighteningly unattractive on ""Gimme a Break"" later on, but she is quite stunning in this; pretty near perfect. Funny how bad hair and fashion can change that. Anyway, that's the best reason I can recommend this one. Check it out if you are a fan of Richard Benjamin, and if you like cute girls, forget about how she looked in Gimme a Break, Michaelsen will have you drooling here. Best to watch after the much better comedy, ""Love At First Bite"", for a humorous, Halloweenish Richard Benjamin double-feature. This isn't as funny as Transylvania 6-5000 or Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, or even the aforementioned Love At First Bite (don't even bother comparing Young Frankenstein), but it should get some laughs out of you if you are cool with corn and camp, and the so-bad-it's-good kinda thing.

Bonus features are basically just the theatrical trailer and a few other trailers, including one for the sequel, ""Saturday the 14th Strikes Back"". Yep, there was a sequel! I don't think there were any returning cast members though. I'll have to check it out sometime. Oh, you also get some text bios here, but it's a cheap release, so that's about it. It's even in fullscreen. *sigh*",1378080000,2,3750,4.560830860534125

1404338,5,B000058TID,"The taglines are ""It gets bad on Friday the 13th but gets worse on Saturday the 14th"" and ""Just when you thought it was safe to look at the calender"". The movie is a mix of comedy, horror, spoof, and satire.

Story: Billy and his family just inherited a spooky, big old house, which reminds me a lot of my grandmother's house. Two vampires want a book that is in the house, but Billy boy finds the book. The book is ""the book of evil"" which unleashes all kinds of odd, crazy, and sometimes cheap looking monsters. After bats are found in the attic by Bill's mother who has a recurring awful joke ""What's with these owls"" Billy's father calls an exterminator who just so happens to be Van Helsing but he charges by the bat (harde har har).

The Good: The acting is meant to be bad and the dialogue is supposed to be silly for instance the father occasionally looks into the camera and smiles. It's very tongue in cheek. There's some decent gore effects like when a Creature from the black lagoon spoof monster gets shot in the head and blood squirts out. The animated intro is nicely done and the stop motion bats are cool. The characters are zany, likeable, and fun. The film is short and zips by fast.

The Bad: For a comedy it is not very funny except for the fight between Waldemar our main vamp and Van which has to be seen to be believed. Dialogue is bad at times and some acting is awful. Some special effects look dreadful.

The Monsters: A werewolf with a horn, vampires, a mummy, a creature from the black lagoon look alike, other oddities, but most of all the oddest and most dumb looking is a creature on the back cover which is hairy with black fur, has slug-like eye stalks, is bipedal, and has 4 arms, it's so stupid looking that I love it.

Fun Facts: Julie Corman (Roger Corman's wife) help made this one. The title parodies Friday the 13th but rather than parody slasher films like its title it parodies Universal Horror classics and 70s films like Jaws. The film also parodies haunted house movies which were a craze at the time, like Amityville Horror [1979]. There is a scene in which a girl takes a bath, a dorsal fin appears in the bathtub but the fin is just the fin on top of a gill-man creature that is a parody of the creature from the black lagoon which is my favorite monster in this film and is the best special effect. The film had a sequel which is pretty bad called Saturday the 14th Strikes Back (1988).

Saturday the 14th is not as funny as Transylvania 6-5000 (parody of Universal Monsters which is good) nor is it as bad as I know what you Did last Friday the 13th. However the film is so bad it's good but the sequel is so bad it's bad.

The film is tongue in cheek and silly but only a kid will find it hilarious. So be like a kid and go into this film with the mind of a child. The opening to the film is animated with a coughing wolf which sets the tone for the movie. I find the film to be just plain fun. It's a campy b-movie that's rated PG so kids can watch it. You can find it on Netflix or watch it for free on YouTube.com because it has been uploaded twice. Not everyone will like it, so go in with a turned off brain and just role with it. Overall I love Saturday the 14th.

Saturday the 14th was released in 1981, the dvd was released 2001 and is rare and out of print. I got mine for 19.96 which it's not worth that much but as I said I am a fan of this film. Fans of obscure 80s horror like myself are currently waiting for films such as Spookies [1986] which is actually good, and The Unnamable 1988 (really good) to get dvd releases as well as few others. Luckily some obscure 80s goodness is being released this October and none other by Shout Factory and what an awesome 4 film set they are releasing, it will have Cellar Dweller 1988 [a personal fav], Dungeonmaster 1985 [another personal fav], Catacombs [have not seen], and Contamination. 7 [outstandingly awfully crap that is not watchable] on it. The dvd gets 5/5 and the film gets 3/5. Oh and by the way the film is extremely cheesy but you probably already guessed that. If you have kids under the age of 12 and who like silly monster movies show them this and if it gives them nightmares or scares them don't blame the movie after all it is a HORROR-comedy.

1404352,2,B000058TID,"John and Mary have just inherited the house of their dreams, but it comes with a catch... The house has been cursed, and soon, their son mistakenly unleashing hordes of monsters from the dreaded Book of Evil as the vampire Count Waldemar and his nemesis, Professor Van Helsing, battle for control over it! As the Book of Evil states: ""It gets bad on Friday the 13th, but it gets worse on SATURDAY THE 14TH!"" This silly spook show is safe for children of all ages, but it doesn't fare well for older audiences. The film opens entertainingly enough, offering up a few clever quips and playful nods to the classics of the genre before the writers run out of ideas and leave us with a slow and tedious second half. When it comes to costuming, the monsters are a joke unto themselves, and suffer from the cheapest dime store designs imaginable. Still, Richard Benjamin, Jeffrey Tambor, and the rest of the cast play their parts with a wink and a smile, hamming it up like the characters in a Scooby Doo mystery. Fond remembrances aside, SATURDAY THE 14TH is better left to childhood nostalgia.

1404356,1,B000058TID,"I watched this on Netflix... That's 77 minutes I'm never getting back

It's supposed to be a ""Horror comedy spoof"" but it's about as funny as a ninety year old man with terminal cancer having both a stroke and a heart attack while drowning, yea like I said not funny.
The ""jokes"" fall flatter than a sticker on the bottom of a steam roller. You are more likely to fall asleep than to laugh.
There is also a ""twist ending"" if you can call pulling something out of your butt that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever a ""twist"" and it must have been buried in there. I can only imagine that a proctologist practiced in micro surgery was implemented to retrieve the ending to this film.

And just when you ask yourself ""Why in the name of flying Inuit poop was this film even made?""... you find out they made a sequel.

I see a lot of people on here and on Netflix giving this good reviews.... SMH.
If you don't know what a good movie is and find the jokes on the side of a Happy Meal box side-splittingly hilarious, then you'll love this film.

The only good that can come from this film is if someone at TGWTG does a review or if Rifftrax covers it.",1339977600,,1147,4.247706422018348

The Corman team did it again with this horror spoof. It is well done and Richard Benjamin and Paula Prentiss are the funniest parents ever put on film. Thier performances alone make the film a real treat. But also the rest of the cast are right there with them having a ball.

While my husband fell asleep at parts, I watched with glee. There were a few very corny scenes I had forgotten about but it was just as entertaining as I remembered.

Everyone seams to be interested in an old house that recently came on the market. What is it that they are interested in? Turns out there is a book of evil. Who ever controls the book controls the world. Mean while as the different parties are looking for the book. Little Billy has inadvertently open the book to release many evil beings on the world (mostly they hang around the house.)

Will the book of evil fall into the wrong hands?
Will obnoxious Aunt Lucille meet a fur coat?
Why must Van Helsing (Severn Darden) move in for the bats to move out?
The big question is who did the dishes?

The film has just about every monster movie clich. Two seen that will have you in stitches are when the kit tries to tell his father that there is a monster in his room and the father of course denies it. The monster is right behind the father. The second scene is the shark fin in the bath tub shacking with frustration as the girl inadvertent disengages her foot from the tub.

The film is packed with many well-known actors. O.K. maybe not by name but surly by sight. Original Music by Parmer Fuller added to the spooky feel.",1507507200,2,1168,4.344036697247707

How many jokes about vampires and sunblock have we heard over the years? Too many. But dang, this movie is likeable that I can't complain. There are also some solid creature effects, too. (A rip-off of the Creature from the Black Lagoon is a real delight.)
