8555006,3,B00AO05AAQ,"I actually sent this back because I didn't like it. I bought it outright because I enjoyed the director's prior work so greatly, so perhaps I should 've looked into it more. Unfortunately I lost  out on like $30-40 returning it, Because policies. However I know many people loved  this show. It's beautifully crafted. The animation is so clean. But, it lacks the. ... archetypal or mythic feeling that say, Revolutionary Girl Utena, has. I feel this makes  a tremendous difference. It's like taking the fairytale aspects out of  Princess Tutu. The frame is missing. .... the weird symbolism had more impact with a frame to give it definitive yet still open to interpretation context.  That's just my opinion though. So, try it out. .... but maybe before buying because returning it was a very expensive.",1481587200,,803,4.875
8555007,5,B00AO05AAQ,"The second set starts to pick up the plot pace and confuse you more than the first collection. It keeps getting weirder and weirder, but at the same time it remains enthralling. I enjoyed the ending, even though it confused me, but I thought about it long and hard and decided it was great. I won't go into why or anything, so you should check it out yourself and decide, it's one you'll either love or hate. Most people decide to hate it because it's not 100% clear and leaves room for personal interpretation. Call it stupid, say it's trying to hard, but in the end I am sure everyone can get something out of this wonderful anime.",1428624000,,633,4.372881355932203
8555008,5,B00AO05AAQ,"It's something special when a show can start off already a little unique, and still end things having surprised you. I hope many viewers, because of course many won't (sadly), continue watching into this half of the series. It's not fair to just say the ""darker"" half or the ""deeper"" half as I've been reading in a lot of reviews. I think the stakes are raised quite high in the plot due to astounding revelations that cascade all the way through to the series finale. However, these truths only make an impact based on what we've learned in the necessary first half of the series. It's a really moving show with well developed characters and a quite bold story that references some recent actual tragedy in Japan. Although the execution is considered fairly surreal I think the emotions are clear as day and if you stick with it will be one of the most entertaining television series, animated or otherwise, you ever watch from start to finish.",1428624000,,945,4.664670658682635

8555010,5,B00AO05AAQ,Penguindrum is a masterpiece of anime. It is very hard to describe Penguindrum as it is very unique. This does include an English dub as well as a sub (The DVD version at least).,1407888000,,178,4.264705882352941
8555011,4,B00AO05AAQ,"Its an interesting series. I first watched it in Japanese, so English with no titles is a blessing. Yeah it's a psycho-deltic roller coaster of well psychology and mystery, along with a splash of fantasy. It tells a great story of how one can change their destiny, but at what cost..?",1385251200,,284,4.588235294117647
8555012,5,B00AO05AAQ,"It looks great
It's in Japanese with English subtitles AND there is an English dub!
2 discs, second half of the series.

If you're thinking about it, don't bother. JUST BUY IT.",1383264000,,176,4.5
8555013,5,B00AO05AAQ,"I really, really loved this anime.  The animation and the voice dubbing is top notch!  The storyline is pretty original as well and it's not something you can just have on in the background you have to pay attention or you may not quite get it.",1368921600,,244,4.282608695652174
