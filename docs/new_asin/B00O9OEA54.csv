8682692,3,B00O9OEA54,Its a good start for young kids and a basic introduction to biblical stories.  It is definitely lacking in the accuracy department.,1510704000,,131,4.954545454545454
8682693,1,B00O9OEA54,These are not Biblically accurate.  And some of the scenes in the first few minutes were too scary for my preschooler.  Very disappointed.  Waste of money.,1503187200,,155,4.884615384615385
8682694,1,B00O9OEA54,"The dialogue is long - and much of this is NOT Biblical.  When Noah tells his wife, ""Be Quiet, Woman!"" in a condescending voice, I was shocked.  This is not a DVD you want your children learning from.",1500249600,,200,4.2368421052631575
8682695,5,B00O9OEA54,All items were great and appreciated by my grandkids,1483142400,,52,4.888888888888889
8682696,2,B00O9OEA54,"These aren't the worst movies I've seen. In fact, they aren't as annoying as another set we have that has an annoying boy who sings often in it; however, this set does refer to God as Jehovah quite often. It creates confusion with my daughter. Other than the use of the name Jehovah, the stories are not terrible. I just wouldnt pay more than $10 for all 3 cds.  If you know of any good bible story dvds for a 6 year old girl, please comment below.",1474243200,,448,4.149425287356322
8682697,5,B00O9OEA54,Wonderful movies for children!  They seem to love all of them - not just this set.  Will buy more.,1461369600,,98,4.105263157894737
8682698,1,B00O9OEA54,"NOT CHRISTIAN BIBLE STORIES!!!! These are the Islamic version.
Terrible animation, corny accents, and the words don't match with the characters' mouth motions.
I ended up throwing it in the trash.",1458172800,5,196,5.354838709677419
8682699,1,B00O9OEA54,"These movies are very dull. Lol My little ones don't get into them at all. Not entertaining at all to watch, don't hold attention, nor are they visually stimulating. Very boring. Sorry. Wish I'd bought something else. I might be able to sell this set for 5 cents. I was very dissapointed-very. We never even watched the entire set. One disc is where we stopped.",1455321600,2,361,4.569230769230769
