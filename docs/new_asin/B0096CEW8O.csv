8734072,1,B0096CEW8O,Well I for one don't know why this is for sale. Only Vanderbilt would release a video with such an audacious title following a 9-4 season and going to a horrible bowl game. Only Vanderbilt fans would be delusional enough to think that James Franklin would stay at Vanderbilt. Only Vanderbilt fans (all ten of them) would even consider purchasing such a horrible DVD that highlights absolutely no accomplishments. THEY DIDNT EVEN WIN THE EAST.,1438473600,,442,4.906666666666666
