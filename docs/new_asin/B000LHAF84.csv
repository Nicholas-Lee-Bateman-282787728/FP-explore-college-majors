8161934,5,B000LHAF84,This DVD was purchased so that I would be able to review in depth my new camera (used). It has helped me undertsnad so many of the nuances of my camera. I can recommend it highly if you own this camera series from Panasonic.,1395532800,,224,4.113636363636363

8161936,3,B000LHAF84,"The HVX Bootcamp DVD wasn't bad. It covers everything the HVX book covers in much the same way. Unfortunately it is rushed, few usable examples, and just different from the software training DVDs I am used to. Good info though.",1248912000,,227,4.7
8161937,5,B000LHAF84,The DVD helped me alot.  Things I did not understand were explained.  If you have an HVX or DVX this is a must have.,1242000000,,116,3.7916666666666665
8161938,5,B000LHAF84,"If anyone can help you to get a solid handle on getting good results from the HVX200, Barry Green is the guy to do it. He concisely delivers and breaks down the essentials of what you really need to know to get the most out of the camcorder.

The big benefit of having this DVD, is that the material is ingested in a way that hits your brain more like real world experience, rather than text from a manual.

Highly recommended!",1211500800,,427,4.2592592592592595
8161939,5,B000LHAF84,"I actually bought these DVDs before my HVX arrived. I can't tell you how glad I was that I did! This camera has so many functions and setting that, if well understood, can help produce one heck of a picture.
That said, there are some things that are more difficult to retain from a manual than from an actually expert in the field; relaying the information step by step.
Incredibly thorough and helpful, you will not regret spending a measly 50 bucks. Knowledge is both power and confidence. I consider this my most fortuitous camera related purchase to date!",1187481600,,559,4.656565656565657
