8246267,5,B0012J3F7S,"Extremely entertaining Wheeler & Woolsey film.  I'd been leary of trying one of these DVD-R's from Nostalgia Home Video, but was very pleased with this one.  The quality is quite good, the film is complete with all original titles, and most importantly has no logos.  I can't speak for the rest of their titles, but am very pleased with this.",1260057600,3,342,4.666666666666667
