8343203,4,B001U9Q4PA,"I recently purchased a Mac G4 and needed some clues on how to get started
using OSX 10.5 Leopard.  The DVD was very helpful because it explained many
shortcuts and hidden features that are not obvious to a new user.  I am
familiar with Windows, but OSX is a very different platform with a slightly
different mindset on how to do things.  I would have liked to see more but
you can cover just so much in 40 minutes.",1283299200,,414,4.215189873417722

Alicia did a great job with this video. I have been a Mac user for some time now and this is a great way to learn a new operating system. I have used books to learn systems before without much success. With this video I can see the same screens that I see on my computer. I'm giving my copy to a friend who is leaving the country tomorrow so, I plan to pick up a new copy this afternoon.",1252022400,,597,5.571428571428571
8343206,5,B001U9Q4PA,"I converted from a PC to a Mac in September '08 and struggled with the basics of navigating the system.  Then I purchased the Intro to Mac OSX 10.5 Leopard, spent an evening with my laptop and a portable dvd player to play the Intro to Mac dvd, and basically learned the system.  Great way to learn, because I could ""pause"" the dvd, practice on the laptop, and then continue play.  I'd recommend the dvd highly!",1241222400,,411,4.381578947368421
