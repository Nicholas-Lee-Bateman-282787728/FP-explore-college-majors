1255637,2,B00002ND89,"This is not an exciting video to watch - quite the contrary:  It's boring.  It outlines the ""Moon Safari"" tour with brutal honesty - the fact that nothing really happens when you're a french duo touring with your  american backup band.  A lot of questions are asked by the director of the  film (which makes me wonder what the focus of the movie REALLY was?) to  unsuspecting passerbys (eg; ""Do you eat at McDonald's?"").
 I  think the whole point to this film is to bore you.  The two stars I give it  are for the videos at the end for the spectacular track ""Sexy  Boy,"" and the follow-up, ""Kelly Watch the Stars,"" which  features a mix previously unreleased!  The video for ""All I need""  bored me more than the 2 hours worth of documentary preceeding it.",952300800,,755,4.455882352941177
1255638,3,B00002ND89,"I am a great fan of Air, but it's one thing to listen to their wonderful mellow grooves and another to plant yourself in front of a television or whatnot and watch a mostly black and white video about their 1998 tour. It  is great, if you do not expect to be entertained continuously for an hour.  I found most amusing was the interviews with people on the street in New  York, London, and Paris with questions such as ""Do you know Air?""  ""What is Music to you?"" blah blah blah french accents blah blah  blah. Buy it for the collection of Air videos at the end: Sexy Boy, Kelly  Watch the Stars, All I Need, and Le Soleil Est Pres De Moi.",950918400,,638,4.146341463414634
1255639,4,B00002ND89,"This is one quirky film. It had me puzzled at first but by the end I was laughing out loud. Yes, this is a documentary about Air's (The French band) first world tour with their album 'Moon Safari'. It contains playful  interviews with the artist themselves, band members and average people on  the street! The only complaint is that I just wished it contained more  concert footage of the show itself. (But maybe that because I missed their  tour.) All four music videos are included especially 'Kelly Watch the  Stars' which sounds incredible! Overall, a fun documentary trying to  capture and understand the insanity of touring.",950313600,,630,4.89622641509434
7915956,5,B00002ND89,"The first time I saw this documentary I simply loved it.

I will be the first to admit, is is NOT your typical run of the mill ""here is this band"" type of documentary.  Mike Mills uses odd camera movements, often venturing off of the subjects mid-speech and showing their environment, with no worries about crew members in the shot.  The movement for me becomes almost transient much like that of a lava-lite... it sort of lulls you, puts you into a hypnotic state that makes the seemingly boring and arbitrary questions the most fascinating.

A number of interviewees will tell the viewers whether or not they like McDonalds (often citing their favorite item on the menu), what kind of animal they would be, the importance of money, what they think of AIR (many of whom do not even know the band)... among a myriad of questions harpooned at AIR, whose slight language barrier often provides a comedic sort of sympathetic viewing experience.

The documentary is entirely in black and white, which doesn't affect my viewing.  I personally am a big fan of b/w, especially when juxtapozed against a band such as AIR, who typically seems to have a lot of vivid color in their sound and aesthetic.

Finally I should say that I am not the biggest fan of AIR, but I still loved this documentary.  I feel as though certain die-hard fans may not love it as much.  Mills does ask a lot of personal questions to the band, often invading their hotel room or talking to them backstage or on the tour bus.  We find out more about them through the live bandmates and AIR themselves... but the direction this documentary takes is much more of an avant-garde experimental documentary sort.  I feel as though filmmakers would really appreciate this film for its unique qualities.

Though I think that AIR is the perfect subject for a doc like this, I also feel that, like an episode of ""Behind the Music"", this could be about almost any band and it would be interesting.",1224806400,,1952,4.626086956521739
7915957,2,B00002ND89,"I purchased this DVD with high expectations of seeing the band perfoming Moon Safari live. While there is some footage of the live performance, its no where near what you'd expect. The title is correct, this is more of a documentary than about the band playing music. A little of the documentary style would have been fine, but when the entire DVD is full of people talking about how great the band is and, well, it just gets old. Like others, I would have much preferred to see the band performing live and less of the filler. I wanted to see how they were going to create the vocals, and what types of instruments they used.

The music videos on the DVD are the only reason I keep it. I prefer the remix of Kelly Watch the Stars on the DVD, its a bit different from the version on Moon Safari.",1105056000,,795,4.264900662251655
7915958,2,B00002ND89,"This video's pretty old but I thought I'd contribute a review of it anyway...
Being a big fan of Air's music and videos, I was really looking forward to something special with this video but it really is the most boring bag of rubbish I've ever payed money for.
It's so disappointing.
All it seems to be about is the Air boys dossing around with their mates ""Phoenix"" and Beck's backing band... It's such a ridiculous idea to just simply release this ""documentary"" when they really should have made it as a supplement to the full concert. ....

In terms of music, all we are ""treated"" to are some short clips of them performing live but not enough to make it interesting.
...
But it does have two redeeming features which is possibly worth the price of buying the video: The brilliant videos for ""Sexy Boy"" and ""Kelly Watch The Stars"" which are on after the main feature.
I really can't see the point of getting this tape except for the promos.
Overall then: VERY disappointing.",1020902400,,978,4.556818181818182
7915959,5,B00002ND89,"If you have a sense of humor, are at least a mild fan of Air and aren't expecting to see a live concert, I think you will enjoy this video.  This documentary gives a glimpse of what the band and their associates are like... I was totally surprised by this video.  From listening to Air's music, you cannot really tell what lighthearted and unpretentious guys they are...
There is a lot of question and answer with many young fans, roadies and random people that is quite amusing.  It's all in black and white.  The end of the video features the hilarious Sexy Boy video, as well as three others, incl. a trailer for the film.  I guess you either get it or you don't... you will see the band ""eating, sleeping, waiting and playing"" just as the title suggests.",1020470400,,758,4.424460431654676
7915960,4,B00002ND89,"I love Air.  I always have... and I always will.  The reason this video doesn't ""work"" for some people is that it was not really made with American sensibilities in mind.  In fact I think it kind of mocks Americans.  It's like a French film, you may get bored, but that's because it's pretty straightforward, and there's no surprises.  American's like action, etc., so that's exactly what we don't get (until the videos)...  Guys, appreciate the video for Air, and it's commentary on us Americans.",969926400,,497,4.788235294117647
7915961,3,B00002ND89,"Why wasn't this DVD a live show??? Air are notorious for rearranging their  songs live, but all we see are just JB playing the theremin and Beth  singing for 2 seconds each.  This documentary in itself was half-cooked. It  is just that we never got to see more about Nicholas and Jean-Benoit, only  edited interviews, reviews from newspapers from New York, LA and London all  reporting the same thing: A french duo with the sounds of the kitschy 70s,  Burt Bacharach, and bla bla bla.  Yet there some hilarious scenes with  their back-up band, who is Beck's band as well (Catch the rap version of  All I Need.) Although the music videos are a nice add-on to the film, it is  not worth the twenty dollars, unless you love to collect Air items.  Hopefully Air will have some fun on their next DVD, like Bjrk and Daft  Punk have before.",965001600,,833,4.473333333333334
7915962,4,B00002ND89,"The Air DVD is mildly disappointing given it is marketed as a documentary on the duo, but the ""complete works of Air"" (4 video clips) are actually worth the money for the DVD. The video clips, while only  song-length, really are mini films and are pretty snappy mixtures of  cinematography, slick retro French design, and that mellow sexy groove.  It's worth noting that the video clips are actually different versions of  the songs than what's on the CD, so if you are a real Air fan this makes  the DVD worth it alone.
The video clip of ""Kelly Watch the  Stars"" is particularly impressive and gave me an interesting,  different interpretation of the song from how I originally perceived it.  The version on the DVD has more 'cha cha' clap sounds added into it which  spice it up more than the originally very mellow version, but I actually  prefer this new version.
A word of warning - I have a Pioneer DV525 with  a region modification, and although this disc is an all-region disc, I have  had some problems getting it to work properly. The main problem is video  corruption after the copyright message at the beginning of the disc.  However I have been able to work around this by pressing ""Menu""  after the copyright message which refreshes the menu and everything seems  to work fine. I suspect this could just be a problem with my player and  region modification but I thought I would mention it anyway.
Overall - a  worthwhile addition to your collection if only to play the video clips on  repeat at a party (which you can do, by programming the titles on your DVD  by the way). But don't expect much from the documentary on the disc.",963532800,,1644,4.565068493150685
7915963,2,B00002ND89,"And boy am I bitter.  Were the makers of this documentary trying to make some profound statement about the differences between America and Europe?  How long does it stay entertaining to know that most people haven't heard  of Air?  Could they not have injected the band members with drugs  (stimulants, preferably) and given us something more interesting to watch  than each of them staring blankly, in turn, into the camera for thirty  seconds?  Could they not PRETEND to have some entertaining quirks or know  some interesting stories?  Since Air is largely souped up easy listening,  couldn't they have played some music in the background more than just one  song at the beginning?  All right, I'll admit, the scene where they walked  through the hotel, knocked on their door, and walked inside was riveting  [sic], but it didn't add to the ""continuity"".  My fellow viewers  (owners of the tape) decided to rewind before the credits finished, and I  am left with the feeling of having squandered much more than an hour.  This  failed even from the ""get to know more about them"" angle; it  revealed squat, and one could have read everything ever printed about them  in the span of this ploy.",959472000,,1193,4.830845771144278
7915964,2,B00002ND89,"lemme start of by saying i was reeally dissapointed with this documentary.  having fast forwarded practically all of the video because of the bore.  only good reason to own this dvd is because of some unreleased art work  from the band AND the music videos that is in it ""sexy boy"",  ""kelly watch the stars"", ""all i need"", and ""le  soleil est pres de moi"".  the music videos are really entertaining to  watch.  Fav. video ""all i need"".  besides that the documentary  really bites.  everytime the band would be in an interview all u ever got  to hear was the reporters questions and thats it,  the video would cut off  to another scene as soon as the french duo would open their mouths,  questions that i was really interested in knowing the answers.  besides  that theres that annoying camera thats always panning left to right in  practically every scene ( it goes so far to the left and right that u see  the walls 75 percent of the time and of the band 25 )  you get practically  no info on the the band, and when it was over i was still in the same place  as when i put the dvd in.  i absolutely love AIR but this documentary  doesnt do it justice.  Good only for the videos and art work.",955843200,,1192,4.261261261261262
7915965,5,B00002ND89,"Don't matter what my reviewing-pals said (/wrote), I liked it much, it's cool for many moods: - Tired, just wanna have a relaxing, interesting  hour in front of your TV. - Relaxed, if you like their sound, you'll like  that little bit unprofessionell made video. - Drunken, have a laugh (or  more) at those fancy  people who where asked something on the  street...
However, my favourite is, was and always will be the 'All I  Need'-video. This sweet girl is such... sweet! But that's not it, it's the  whole video. For me it has a high grade of perfection. It's a small story  about feelings, melody and rhythm and skating! Love it, have it!",954288000,,641,4.56140350877193
