8038562,5,B00064LISI,I bought this product based on another review and I have to agree.  The content is perfect for someone who is either an enthusiast or a student.  I would highly recommend this and the General 1950-1970.,1170892800,,202,4.583333333333333
8038563,5,B00064LISI,"Again, like the Origins of Animation, I read the negative hype and bought it anyway.  For a student, like me, this is a very convenient way of getting the content.  It is at least a buy from a reseller.",1168560000,2,202,4.153846153846154
8038564,5,B00064LISI,"Sometimes it seems like advertisers will do just about anything to get people to buy their products. And, when you look at movies like this you realize that this is true.

The premise of these films is that during the depression it was really hard to get people to buy anything because they had no money at all. This was before television so there was no way to simply beam commercials into people's homes so they had to find some other way to get attention.

They certainly find a bunch of ways, everything from skywriting to crazy publicity stunts to ""shock"" print ads (that would seem very tame today.)

I liked the historic value of seeing just how desperate ad people can get in a bad economy.",1146614400,3,698,4.480314960629921
8038565,5,B00064LISI,"First off, you should know that these are not television ads - unlike a lot of DVD advertising collections out there. These ads actually pre-date television.

I bought this set as part of a marketing class I'm taking and it gave me a lot of good ideas for how to sell things and get the public's attention.

You see skywriting and how billboards were designed and pre-video publicity stunts.

There isn't any commentary so you sort of have to piece together what is goign on on your own, but I didn't have any problems.

Of the bunch the skywriting clip is the best one.",1146441600,4,570,4.451923076923077
