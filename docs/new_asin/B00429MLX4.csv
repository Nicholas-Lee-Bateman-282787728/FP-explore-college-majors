4246884,5,B00429MLX4,"takes place right after WWII in a small town in Sicily. How a young boy had to suffer all his adult life because of his political beliefs, and poor family. a great movie",1371340800,2,169,4.151515151515151
4246885,4,B00429MLX4,"Giuseppe Tornatore is one of my favorite directors. I own almost all his movies - ""Malena"", ""The Star Maker"", ""The Legend of 1900"", I have VHS casettes with the unbelievable ""Pure Formality"" with Roman Polanski as a main character and the great ""Everybody is Fine"" with Marcello Mastroianni (and still waiting for DVDs for these two), so it was pretty natural for me to buy ""Baaria"". This is entirely different from all others - I don't think it has the same feel of urgency and expectation as his other movies. It is a story of a man and his family in a town Bagheria which in Sicily they call Baaria and where Tornatore was born - the story of the family is projected on the history of the town and actually of the entire country through about fifty years. The struggles of the family are described in a typical sentimental, almost tear-jerking  way of film-making, which I would not have expected from this director - I usually avoid such movies. Another annoying thing for me was the emphasis on the main character's involvement in the communist movement, all through the years. I can understand that this is part of Italy's history, but while this man ages from being a teenager to being a head of a big family, there should have been a development of the character and better understanding of where things are with the communist ideas. Does it reflect the views of the director - I don't know and I hope not.
Despite all of this, the story is captivating, the actors are very good, the 150 minutes fly by very fast, and I think most of the people would like this movie, if only our cinema distribution system allowed to show it in the theaters in this country.",1365292800,4,1666,4.534883720930233
4246886,2,B00429MLX4,"The movie was a little slow and too many characters that confuses the viewer. The main character seems to have a lot of flashback to his father, his fathers father (granddad) and the intercut of the different generations got me lost half way into the film. Plus it was  a tad too long.",1362873600,2,285,4.377358490566038
4246887,5,B00429MLX4,"Bellisima filme! Gorgeous film, beautiful scenery and wonderful acting. This movie comes from the same director as Cinema Paradiso. Cinema Paradiso was my first introduction to foreign films. I was 12 years old when I first saw that wonderful film. I HIGHLY recommend this Italian gem.",1361664000,2,285,5.217391304347826
4246888,4,B00429MLX4,"Very nice movie.  Touching and well made.  Memorable, a bit confusing, still not sure about the way the ending ties to the beginning.",1330128000,,133,4.739130434782608
4246889,5,B00429MLX4,"I have spent quite a lot of time trying to find the Sicilian version of this movie in the U.S. and when I finally watched the America release in ""Italian"" I found that the movie had a lot of Sicilian.  Sicilian being my first language it was music to my ears.  Sicilians are a unique and passionate people.  Our language is so expressive and truly musical.  I only wish there were more movies that were made in our native language. I'm guessing that this was released and marked as Italian because Americans will not notice the different languages...One scene in particular, when Peppino is running to school in the very beginning the teacher is yelling for him to hurry he shouts, ""Sperugiate"" (please excuse the spelling), but that is Sicilian. It happens many times in the film and appropriately (Sicilian being the conversational/familiar language used with friends and family, while Italian is spoken formal settings).  Growing up in a Sicilian family we speak Sicilian at home and with our relations and neighbors, but with other Italians or when conducting serious business we speak in proper Italian.  Anyway, I hope the people who watch this film experience the same satisfaction and feel the same nostalgia that I did when watching this film. Some of the nostalgia comes from my own experiences as my parents sent me Sicily as a child several times to spend summers there and some of the nostalgia stems from the verbal history my grandparents imparted on us.",1321142400,56,1469,4.856
4246890,5,B00429MLX4,"BAARIA is another masterwork form the consummate film artist Giuseppe Tornatore.  Tornatore is so highly regarded in Italy and Sicily that famous actors fight for the opportunity to work in one of his luminous films, agreeing to take minute walk on roles just to be near the director: Monica Belluci, &Aacute;ngela Molina, Beppe Fiorello, Raoul Bova etc.  This film deserves close attention form the viewer - and in some ways it may be better to view the DVD's Interview with Giuseppe Tornatore BEFORE watching this film so that the writer/director's concept and technique is understood before the story unfolds.

Baar&igrave;a is Sicilian slang for Bagheria where Tornatore was born and this is an autobiographic epic of three generations in the Sicilian village where he was born. It begins in the 1920's where Giuseppe ""Peppino"" Torrenuova lives with his brother Nino and his parents in a hovel. They are so poor that Peppino's father advises him to become a shepherd in order to help support the family. Peppino progresses to taking a cow around the town to fill the milk buckets of the townspeople, struggles through school, progresses to young adulthood when he falls in love with Mannina and going against Mannina's family's dream of having their daughter marry money, the two elope - in the home of Mannina! - and it is here that the characters become the adults who carry the film.  Of note, Tornatore elected to cast the main characters with little known Sicilian actors: Peppino is Francesco Scianna and Mannina is Margareth Mad&egrave; - both brilliant in their roles.  From this point the time passes through historical references to Il Duce, the mafia, WW II and the coming of the Americans, but more important is Peppino's idealistic concept that his future lies in politics.  He becomes a Communist, rises in the ranks, eventually even visiting Moscow to meet with Stalin, and returns to Baaria to help the people struggle for land reform and socialism, all the while he continues to have children with Mannina and follow his dreams of being a successful politician, a dream that is as fragile as it is unattainable.

The film flashes back and forth in time and has no linear story line: Tornatore is more interested in taking snippets of his memories of his past life growing up in Baaria than he is in keeping the audience clear about the characters who flash in and out of the story.  His use of children is magical - they seem more wise in their innocence that the adults.  But take the movie for what it is - a m&eacute;lange of remembered moments in the writer/director's life - and witness some of the most beautiful moments ever created for the screen, such as the eventual death of Peppino's father who passes his wisdom to his son, and Peppino's advice to this oldest son as the son takes the train to Rome: the son asks 'Why do people call us hotheaded?' to which Peppino answers 'Because we think we can embrace the Universe, but our arms are too short.'  Peppino's wisdom he passes to his son is to follow his heart at all costs and there will he find satisfaction. This film is overflowing in such moments and watching it is like opening a treasure trunk full of dazzlingly memories. The musical score by the evergreen Ennio Morricone is absolutely one of his finest - a score the composer created in conjunction with Tornatore.

There is a problem with the DVD that hopefully someone will solve: the English subtitles (the film is in Italian and Sicilian) are very difficult to read - so bleached out  are they over backgrounds of bright Sicilian light.  It is a post-production flaw that needs to be corrected for non Italian speaking audiences, but even with that minor problem, this is one of the most touching and tender and emotionally satisfying films this viewer has ever seen. 10 stars!

4246891,1,B00429MLX4,"For those that care, this blu-ray version hacked the original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 to 1.78:1. If you want to see the film the way it originally was, you will have to import a blu-ray or dvd from another country.",1318550400,13,213,4.35
4246892,4,B00429MLX4,"As a legitimate proud of a the most faithful tradition of the Neo Realism tradtion, Tornatore returns to Sicily to undertake the task of telling us the life and times of a fervent believer of the new hopes of a better tomorrow.

The man and his circumstances, disavenences through thirty years from his early youth until his early fifties. The film captivates and engages, and if it's true it lacks of the enraptured magic of Cinema Paradise, the movie will reward you, due its unforgettable and laughable vignettes all the way through, without loosing ends about the inner contradictions between the reformer politician and the old fashioned head of family.

The marvelous introduction reminds us so much to De Sica's Miracle in Milan, where the fantasy and surrealistic images allows us to be part of his narrative scheme.

Terrific cast, splendid script and amazing photography make of this movie a must-see. Don't miss it.",1309132800,6,926,5.0

4246894,5,B00429MLX4,"Amazing. I wanted to watch this film over and over again. It kept me wanting to see more. Politics is the main theme, however, Pepino the main charter whom the story is about, from the beginning of his life throughout his life he was always in the spotlight.

I bought it because I wanted to learn more about the town of my ancestors.
The saga of the family depicted in this story was everything I hoped for and more.
It was an artistically told drama, a love story, and an eye opening depiction of life there throughout the 20th century.
If you have been told stories of your Sicilian ancestors and want to see their character come to life you'll enjoy this movie.
Best of all, the mafia is barely mentioned in this tale. It is only mentioned as a fact of life they must contend with occasionally.",1461369600,2,647,4.355371900826446

4246908,5,B00429MLX4,"Fact and fantasy intertwined into masterpiece storytelling.  Baaria was a visual Sicilian version of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"".  Tornatore presented the best portrayal of Sicilian culture
and history - better than any book  I read - with beautiful style and honesty.  Sicilian pride, honor, respect, temperament and sacrifice were clearly displayed with humor and passion throughout the film.

I'm still unclear about some of the allegorical frames of reference, but that has tempted me to view the film again, and again.  The conclusion has me wondering if Sicily has been asleep for the past 60 years.  If so, then Tornatore has woken it up without destroying its dreamlike qualities.  Baaria should be recognized as a classic for which it is.",1445126400,7,776,5.201612903225806

However, I think he tried to cover a little too much in this film, and the end result is a film that is so fast paced (even at 2.5 hours long) that it becomes emotionally uninvolving and, at times, somewhat hard to follow . Though not an outright failure in terms of quality, I think the vast scale of this film could have been better represented as a mini-series.",1405900800,,457,4.325581395348837

4246940,5,B00429MLX4,"DVD Arrived promptly, condition excellent.
Tornatore's film, however, was a great disappointment. For this viewer the storyline, choppy editing, and haphazard placement/integration of minor characters (rarely has there been a wasting of acting talent that exceeds Tornatore's perplexing misuse of Luigi LoCascio) are not compensated for by lush photography of the Sicilian landscape. Fellini loved his characters in Amarcord. Here, unlike his work in Cinema Paradiso, Tornatore does little more than reveal the rambling nostalgia of a still photographer rather than, a' Fellini, the illuminating soul of the artist. Modern Sicily may be as joyless a place as this film with its wealth of tense, unsmiling caricatures suggests, but for my money the films of Pietro Germi have already shown us that and very much more over 50 years ago, with more generously of mind & spirit, and without depriving us or his characters of a smile or two.",1375660800,2,935,5.281879194630872
