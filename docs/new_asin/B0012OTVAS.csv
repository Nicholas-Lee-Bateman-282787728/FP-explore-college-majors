8246930,1,B0012OTVAS,"I actually almost thought about buying this DVD, but then I saw that my local library had a copy. Thank goodness I checked it out for free from the library. This DVD is very, very dated. It reminded me of a video they would have showed us in elementary class in the late 70's and even then it would have been dated!! Some of the information was kind of fun.  I like the references to literary writers and their time in Venice. However, like what everyone else said, it looks like it's slides of old postcards and some are out of focus. I did like the old 1960's hairdo's and outfits - haha!  I wouldn't purchase this DVD.  If you can, check it out from a local library instead.",1427500800,,677,4.232558139534884
8246931,5,B0012OTVAS,History is visually explained or shown about Venice and that adds to ny fascination of how this power house existed.,1379203200,,116,4.85
8246932,2,B0012OTVAS,"I have been to Venice and loved it, so wanted this DVD as a keepsake.  Very disappointing quality.  Poor photography and poor narrative voice.  Not worth buying.",1357257600,,161,4.888888888888889
8246933,1,B0012OTVAS,"This video is shot from still photographs, many of them blurry and reused five or six times during the video in an attempt to create content. The narration alternates from mechanical recitation of facts (there are 72 columns in the courtyard) to breathlessly romantic...and not all of the facts are...well, facts. (Not sure where they got the founding date of Venice from, but it was off by about 400 years). A city as historically important and beautiful as Venice deserves a lot better.",1355788800,,488,4.891566265060241
8246934,1,B0012OTVAS,"This ""video"" is not a video at all but a series of very very poor resolution still images with a sound track.  It is awful!  Most of the images are out of focus and very poorly composed!  You can put together a series of google images from the internet and play some music and have a far better result!
This was not worth the postage much less the purchase price...I threw it away..not even worth giving it to someone!",1294963200,4,418,4.265822784810126
8246935,1,B0012OTVAS,"This is a DREADFULLY boring slide show of old, out of focus, faded, poor quality photos from what appears to be the 1950's or 1960's.  The female narrator has an awful, overly dramatic British accent. I'd be impressed if you can make through 10 minutes without shutting it off and then writing a scathing review on Amazon.",1263340800,9,322,4.649122807017544
8246936,2,B0012OTVAS,"Out of focus slide show (it looks like photos of old post cards where the
colors have faded) and a cheesy narrative.  Don't waste your money.",1220918400,13,141,4.423076923076923
