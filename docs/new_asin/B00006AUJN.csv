7966741,5,B00006AUJN,"Maybe I'm being a little biased because I'm an Arizona State alumni and sports fan, but this is easily my favorite made-for-TV movie. For not having a huge budget, the directors and crew did an excellent job with making this as real as possible. Unfortunately since this movie obviously wasn't endorsed by the university, and it wasn't filmed on location in Tempe, Arizona. Instead, it was filmed thoughout Las Vegas, Nevada (both on the strip and the surrounding suburbs) and Los Angeles, California. The basketball scenes were actually shot at The Forum in Inglewood, CA, and the directors and crew did a fantastic job of making it look like Wells Fargo Arena.

Some minor details aren't historically accurate, mostly the timing of the events following the scandal, but that's expected any time a movie is based on a true story. David Krumholtz, in one of his first leading roles, did a great job portraying the real Benny Silman, and looks and sounds almost exactly like him. This movie is basically Benny's side of the story, as most people are familiar with Hedake's side, from what he's stated in interviews with Sports Illustrated and SLAM Magazine. From someone who grew up watching Stevin Smith play and looking up to him, I'm really disappointed at how much he lied about what really happened to better his image, and get a reduced sentence.

This movie answers any and all questions regarding what really happened with the point-shaving scandal ASU dealt with in 1994. If you're a college hoops fan, or just a sports fan in general, this movie will definitely appeal to you.",1392681600,,1585,4.866666666666666
7966742,5,B00006AUJN,"Most Amazing true account of Arizona State University Sports teams conspiring with a Jewish MOB connected Fraternity Man gone Bookie.
Bennie, I never knew personally, I did not know of this happening as a student while at ASU. There is a special scene of a charactor
who resembled the Uni-Brow Pat Tillman ASU Football player, NFL Cardnals Legend and former Ranger (It is my opinion Pat was too straight and would not be involved in throwing a game for the MOB).

The fates of some students at ASU at the end of the film is quite shocking. Wait until the very end and Benny gives a real life interview.
Hats off and applause to the casting director because these people look exactly like who I saw on campus when I was a student.
I would love to take classes from the productions staff who made this amazing movie not to be missed. To think this was going
on and I did not know about it just blew me away.",1321747200,,905,4.355029585798817
7966743,5,B00006AUJN,If you like sports betting or are into gambling you will enjoy this movie. I like the fact it's based on a true story. No this isn't a major blockbuster but if you are into any kind of gambling I think you will have a high appreciation for this movie. Going from rags to riches in a very short period of time only to come crashing back down. Just shows how fast you can get caught up in something and how greedy people really are.  After watching this it really makes you think how much point shaving in college games actually is going on. This is a must have dvd for all the gamblers out there!,1257811200,,595,4.129310344827586
7966744,5,B00006AUJN,"This movie, based on a true story is interesting and Ernest Dickerson's direction is superb - I like the 'shaky' camera effects. David Krumholtz is awesome as Benny Silman! He starts out as a naive freshman, moving across the country to go to college, but the freedoms get the best of him. He starts gambling, then works for a bookie, then goes out on his own. He ends up hooking up with a b-baller to assure the house wins everytime, but the wrong people find out about his scheme and it gets complicated.

The subplot with Callie is cute, especially when she mocks him. This movie is great, even after repeated viewings.",1076803200,3,622,4.553571428571429
