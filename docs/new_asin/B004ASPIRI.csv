8420854,4,B004ASPIRI,"The sister to WW2 the complete history dvd set, this documentary on the pacific theatre is very true to it's time..Even to go as far as unedited from it's original release..It explains the war from start to finish, giving straight facts backed up with original pictures..It is completely an information dictionary on WW2 giving the facts while not spending too long on any one topic...The long length of this documentary makes it worth having for the price..Though at times it does show you the politics and the processes of the war at rather drawn out lengths to explain everything that happened including battle strategy and fleet movements...For this reason only, I give it a 4 out of 5",1322956800,3,689,4.8474576271186445
