8211985,5,6301005546,"I have seen other Romeo and Juliet ballet, this one is the best so far. It seems that every part of the story is showed in ballet.",1395014400,2,130,3.8518518518518516
8211986,5,6301005546,This was a gift for my father-in-law and he loves it. He loves ballet and was excited to find this performance.,1392422400,,111,4.333333333333333
8211987,5,6301005546,"I love this DVD. I have always loved Ferri and Eagling together, though they danced only a few years at the Royal, before she left for ABT. I also love Kenneth MacMillan's choreography. He was my favorite choreographer. This is my second favorite ballet. His ""Manon"" is my absolute favorite. I also like ""Mayerling,"" and many of his other ballets. He work is poetry to me. Vivian Taube :)",1381017600,2,388,4.63768115942029
8211988,5,6301005546,"This is a very moving performance of Romeo and Juliet. Ferri is simply amazing. She makes a very poignant Juliet - so small and fragile that her premature death seems even more inevitable and thus tragic. She is very young in this performance and so slight in stature and girlish in appearance that in some scenes she could almost pass for 13 as Shakespeare imagined her; that is, if her dancing wasn't so mature, brilliant, and sheerly elegant. When Richard Strauss wrote his opera ""Salome,"" he lamented that it would require a 15 year old princess with the voice of Isolde by way of specifying the requisite adolescent appearance accompanied by the necessary power of voice, something that has never yet been achieved. In this Romeo and Juliet, Ferri may have pulled off the balletic equivalent.",1247529600,4,797,4.867647058823529
8211989,5,6301005546,"This is a superb performance, but not by Legris, Maurin et al. Rather, it features Legris and Loudieres in the leads and Jude, Delanoe, Romoli and Martinez as the main secondary characters. Legris & Maurin were featured in the equally wonderful Dancer's Dream/Romeo & Juliet.",1206662400,,275,5.133333333333334
8211990,5,6301005546,"I saw a broadcast of Romeo and Juliet by the Royal Ballet during the holidays while I was in Belgium, on either a Belgian or Dutch TV channel. They explained that the choreography was the same it has been for years. It was phenomenal. So I looked for and found this DVD. This recording is from more than 20 years ago but it is very good. Juliet is outstanding. The costumes are more traditional than in the 2008 broadcast. This DVD is highly recommended",1204329600,2,453,4.404761904761905
8211991,5,6301005546,"While I've never seen the Ferri/Corella version, I have seen the Fonteyn/Nureyev one and I still find this version to be superior. Nureyev's favorite onstage lover was always...Nureyev. Which is tolerable for something like Don Quixote where Basilo is a flirty mischievous guy in love with a flirty mischevious girl anyway. But I personally don't want to see that in Romeo and Juliet.

Wayne Eagling on the other hand makes for a wonderful, if slightly unorthodox, Romeo. He plays the character as an older, wiser, street-smart guy who spends his days pranking with friends and hanging out with harlots...and still falls head over heels in love with a young naif anyway. It actually adds to the story, I think. Though his technique has nowhere near the level of prowess that Nureyev's had (precious few dancers can claim to have that), his acting and chemistry more than make up for it. His onstage relationship with Ferri is potent and loving, and you genuinely feel for their fate. This is Ferri's best performance of Juliet; from young and lively and girlish to loving and womanly to grief stricken, she manages to capture every ounce of the character in her acting and in the simple way she carries herself through the movements.

One part of this performance that I don't feel gets enough credit is the partnering between Juliet and Paris. I confess I don't know the dancer's name who played Paris, but he did an admirable job; he shows just how perplexing Juliet's behavior was towards him. And Ferri's emotional range as expressed through the movement with him is brilliant.

Another part that I enjoyed was the crypt sequence (or as I and my Romeo called it: the dead doll pas de deux). I've danced this ballet before, and put simply: dancing this pas de deux sucks. No matter how gentle Romeo tries to be, Juliet still feels like a sack of coffee beans being chucked around on a truck to Starbucks. And when you add in the dangling upside down for a couple minutes before the final curtain fall, where you wonder if you'll have a brain embolism of some sort, it's downright painful. But you'd never guess any of that from Eagling and Ferri's performance, and that's the true beauty of it.

Sure, it looks dated, and the sound and video quality aren't what you'll find in say, a 2005 performance. But if you decide not to see this for those reasons alone, you'll be missing a brilliant and beautiful performance.",1170288000,12,2420,4.741092636579572

8211993,5,6301005546,"When Wayne Eagling first took over the role of Romeo, a perfect collaboration of choreographer and dancer occurred.  First known for his soaring ""Bluebird"", with Macmillan a dancer/actor was born.  And as with Ferri some 10-15 years later, Macmillan had found a muse, or at least one of THE best interpreters of his choreography to come along since Lynn Seymour (sp?).  So for dramatic interpretation this pairing of a young Ferri and more experienced Eagling is first class.
Technically, Eagling won't match the brilliance of Angel Corella in the newer La Scala pairing with Ferri, but in some ways Eagling's maturity and intensity greatly compensates for any lack of perfection in placement or ballon.  And the details are in the care and perfection of his partnering.  Watch closely, and you will see how he calms, supports, and enhances Ferri's performance whether it's simply sqeezing her hand, or steadying her placement.  That's a working partnership, and for the young dancer she was, it's breathtaking to watch the give and take both dramatically and technically.
So even though the Fonteyn / Nureyev partnership in this ballet (and soon after Dowell/Sibling) is more celebrated, I still think Ferri/Eagling is the one that counts.  Fonteyn and Nureyev, though skilled as always, are/were a little too old to play the teenage lovers, and of course Dowell/Sibling were never recorded on tape (except of a brief glimpse of Sibling in ""Turning Point"") for us masses.
So, hopefully this DVD will enable us to watch a beautiful performance in glorious color, with enhanced sound, and the ability to see the details through the excellent camera direction preserved in the original broadcast.  Thanks for finally releasing it on DVD.",1115942400,36,1735,5.149466192170818
