5391259,2,B00A705Q5W,"The only reason I watched past halfway point was because I am a fan of Jung Hwa Eum.  It was too tedious to watch.  A lot of noise, plots, changes of scene and hoopla about nothing.",1421884800,,181,4.0
5391260,4,B00A705Q5W,"It was an awesome movie, wicked twists and turns, a bitter-sweet end. I don't know if the Korean Mafia life is exactly like this, though I can see some possibilities. If you want to see a movie about a Father who realizes that it's time to put down the knife and take care of his family, then this is the movie for you. I warn you though...the end may not be what you expect.",1416009600,2,375,4.081081081081081

8547393,4,B00A705Q5W,"Song's performance is great, like in his other movies. But the narratives could have been organized better if the scenes were combined with both past and present, alternatively. A chronological sequence is just boring and not effective to make the story more intriguing. Also, it appears that the director and the producers didn't put their best efforts to make the movie better. Some scenes and settings are so mechanical and boring.",1468022400,,434,5.126760563380282

8547395,4,B00A705Q5W,"A sad comedy about an old gangster trying leave his old life. Acting is very good and the story is decent. Could have been a bit shorter but I cannot complain. I wish it showed how messed up the criminal world was but the movie sort of not emphasizes that part. Overall, good movie!",1463616000,,282,4.2407407407407405
