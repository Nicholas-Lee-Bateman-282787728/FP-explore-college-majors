3619656,5,B001GT9DPM,just got it today very happy and for all that don't know it is in Jap sub's or in English!!,1240790400,2,91,3.6
3619657,4,B001GT9DPM,"This is a great anime series.  It combines elements of a sports anime with elements more akin to mecha or fighting anime.  It bears noting that this anime IS NOT FOR KIDS!  There is foul language, nudity and some light boy on boy kissing as well.

The animation quality and voice acting are great.  The soundtrack for this series is amazing as well.  It follows the beginning of a teen aged boy's journey into the fictional sport of Air Trek, where inline skates have been paired with powerful and tiny motors.  Living with a surrogate family composed of four sisters Rikka, Mikan, Ringo and Ume the main character Ikki is drawn into the somewhat shady world of Air Trek, a world that the sisters he lives with seem to know quite a bit about but are hesitant to let him into the world of Storm Riders (the term that Air Treck users refer to themselves as).

This series was canceled after a single season in Japan, so if you wish to know how the story ends you'll have to get a hold of the Manga.  The manga remains in production and has yet to be completed.",1232668800,4,1058,4.357142857142857
8306977,5,B001GT9DPM,I loved this show when I first watched it and cried when it ended and then watched it three more times over and just had to buy it. I have been showing it to my one friend getting into anime and he loves it too.,1476230400,,211,3.7111111111111112

8306980,5,B001GT9DPM,I've been wanting to get this series for awhile now and was thinking about getting the Funimation S.A.V.E. Edition but when I saw the box set used-like new I couldn't resist getting it and with a great price. Thank you very much for letting me add this series to my Anime Collection.,1366761600,2,283,4.461538461538462
8306981,5,B001GT9DPM,My product came in the condition as described and the dvds look like they haven't even been used. Also came before the date amazon said it would.,1300060800,,145,4.407407407407407
8306982,4,B001GT9DPM,"I'm usually not into anime like this.  I prefer Ghost in the Shell or Cowboy Bebop.  And even though there is a lot of juvenile humor all over this series, I still felt compelled to keep watching.  Sure, it's formulaic; a young man discovers that he's secretly gifted at something he's never tried.  And through constant trials, becomes everyone's hero.
Except with motorized roller blades.  Apparently, there's a legend about a roller-blader that...  Anyway, the plot has been used before.
What I liked about Air Gear was the characters.  They each actually have some depth, and react to the situation with their own insecurities.  That is, when they're not pooping in front of everyone.
Air Gear is a light, fun series that kept me entertained.  I do wish someone would pick up the project and finish it though.  The show ends about half way through the story line.",1275436800,2,867,4.797297297297297
8306983,5,B001GT9DPM,"I watch this anime online, this anime is awesome. Lot of Bad language, Nudity and also little of boy on boy kissing. The anime is not for kids under 16",1263427200,2,151,4.066666666666666
8306984,5,B001GT9DPM,"This is a bunch of fun wrapped in awesome. Yes, it's dirty and rude but whatever! Very R rated, so no kids. I'm not gonna repeat the other reviews so... However, I do recommend this one just for it music.",1258588800,,204,4.125
8306985,5,B001GT9DPM,"When i watched the first episode online i thought ""ugh another sport anime"", but after some time I saw a bit of style in it. It's very comical, and call out on the anime special effects where people get noodle arms and such. This is definitely a guy anime, not just because of the nudity but because the humor hits home. This anime has a techno type style to it. The soundtrack also helps this style with some actually good beats that fit the situation and rarely repeat the same crap again and again. Lots of fan service, some good hard headed antics, and hilarious moments make this a great anime.",1251158400,9,599,4.405405405405405
8306986,1,B001GT9DPM,"The reviews so far on here are misleading. This series is entirely formulaic and hardly deserving of 4 or 5 stars. At absolute best it's only a 3 star series.

It's basically extreme sports, loosely based off of rollerblading and skate-boarding, with some magic thrown in. The main character is a bit of a loser, gross at times, and almost always juvenile. As others have mentioned, it's not for kids as there are adult themes and nudity (which also usually comes across as juvenile). There's the usual ""protagonist taps into his hidden energy to pull something amazing off"" stuff, but it's just hard to take the protagonist seriously since he is so juvenile and portrayed as a loser more often than someone you would actually want to follow or could respect.

The series reminded me the most of Get Backers (out of the fight anime I have watched). Except Get Backers had interesting protagonists, interesting villains (e.g. Dr. Jackal)  and broke out of the Fight Anime mold with episodes like recovering the Stradivarius, the one about famous artists, the really hilarious episode with Ginji in the hospital, etc. They also actually go the Limitless Fortress in both seasons.

AirGear is Get Backers without the interesting parts, without the interesting characters, and literally without any resolution -- the whole 8 kings story arc was clearly meant for season two, which never happened. So on top of all of the formulaic action, contrived plots, 1 dimensional characters, etc. you also don't even get a decent ending.

My advice: pick up Get Backers instead.",1246924800,6,1564,4.977011494252873
