8241929,4,B0011MOLR4,"Very interesting video, good quality and shipped very quickly. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is due to the fact that it has no menu options. There is no division between the three films on this disc and you must fast forward through the first to watch the second film or fast forward through both the first and second in order to watch the third (which features WE Fairbairn and is the only reason that I purchased this video). The case to my disc arrived heavily damaged, though the disc showed no damage and the seller was very accommodating and is sending me another case.",1446422400,,584,4.416666666666667
8241930,4,B0011MOLR4,"Very interesting, especially for students of military history, clandestine history, and of the OSS in particular.  One short training film about equipment that was used, a short film showing the integration of OSS with US Army maneuvers in battle, and one on some of the initial training.  Drawback is that it whets the appetite for other films and, right now, I am finding the availability scarce.",1382659200,,398,5.015151515151516
8241931,4,B0011MOLR4,"The DVD is narated like old films you would have seen in school years ago.  The training of the OSS members was interesting to me because I know someone who was a part of the OSS.  If you are interested in the predasessor to CIA, you will like this DVD.",1363219200,,253,4.04
