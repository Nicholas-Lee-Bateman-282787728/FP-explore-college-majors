5612376,5,B00BEZEDNU,WE enjoyed every minute of the show and look forward to the next years episodes that hopefully will be as interesting as the past ones.,1372464000,,135,4.44
5612377,5,B00BEZEDNU,George Gently is an outstanding collection. Our family watches each one together. We love them. George is a real CDI.,1372377600,3,117,4.9
5612378,4,B00BEZEDNU,"We always look forward to the Gently series and finally couldn't stand it--bought the entire series 1-5.  Very good.  Recommended if you like English who-done-its!  Especially like the personal interactions between Gently, the victims, his co-workers, et. al.  Thanks, Amazon for access to British shows. (Wish we could get Canadian, Australian and New Zealand offerings also!)",1371945600,8,377,5.678571428571429
5612379,5,B00BEZEDNU,"I have been a fan of Martin Shaw for a long time. I rented this from Netflix And with the good pricing for this set, I bought it. HE is also great in Judge John Deed.",1370649600,8,166,3.638888888888889
5612380,5,B00BEZEDNU,"Although Amazon states that this blu-ray box-set is Region A, I would very much like to know if this is correct. Very often their information on this matter is in-correct....
Can someone who buys this box-set, or who already owns the other blu-ray series, tell me if it is Regio A or Region-free (says so on the back of the cover). I live in Europe and would very much like to buy this series on blu-ray, but it is not available in that format over here (as are a lot of other British series, a real shame). Thanks very much in advance!!",1369180800,2,537,4.2745098039215685
5612381,5,B00BEZEDNU,"George Gently is a fearless London crime fighter cop who moves to Northumberland (NE England) after his wife is murdered. George Gently Series episodes are based on selections of the 46 Gently novels by Alan Hunter. Episodes are feature-length, and can serve as stand alone stories. No need to watch them back-to-back in a hurry. A really good 1960s period crime show with excellent plot writing. An acclaimed BBC hit.

All season/episodes come with SDH SUBTITLE option
Season 1:  This first series shows the beginning, when Commander Gently's wife is killed right before his eyes. Even through his grief, the cop takes the high road in finding criminals and bringing them to justice. The 3 episodes in this series are very much like ""Midsomer Murders"".
- - - 2: Four feature-length episodes, each 89 minutes, & each serve as great stand-alone crime mystery films tied together only by a 1964 date. Gently has not given up fighting crime of all sorts and is now Chief Inspector in the extremely beautiful north countryside.
- - - 3: Gently, played by Martin Shaw, is through, calm, and plays the mentor/father to his youthful assistant, Detective Sargent John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby). Their relationship is as important to the story/series as the crimes and investigations. Both are performance perfect. Bacchus provides some laughs. 2 episodes.
- - - 4: PC Taylor (Simon Hubbard) is also back for both episodes. An emotional crime series, mystery, suspenseful, fast moving, and packed with plot. A perfect personality bounce between DCI Gently and Sgt Bacchus, with comedy spice. See individual series listings for George Gently on Amazon for my reviews having individual episode details, but not spoilers.

There is a fifth season to be released at the same time as the collection. Get them all.
Not recommended for the kiddies, bloody good murder, and emphasis on the bloody.",1364342400,44,1876,5.04516129032258

5612418,5,B00BEZEDNU,A really great mystery that will keep your attention.  The context of it being set in the 1960's is a constant fount for stories.

5612432,5,B00BEZEDNU,"Great ""period"" detective series set in the 1960s, portraying the various social changes at that time which often influenced the crimes or the solving of them.  Lead actors are a great combination / complement, and the various supporting actors/actresses in each episode do a fine job.

5612433,5,B00BEZEDNU,I love this program! This show deals with issues people face daily in their personal life. The music is awesome and of years past. I have never heard of some of the songs and one song was so beautiful I searched for it and bought it. It isn't shown often in my area and I record every show.

5612439,5,B00BEZEDNU,"This is one terrific crime show! it's set in the 60's and recreates the era beautifully. The acting is superb, the stories are compelling, and the set design, costumes, hair & make-up are right on target for the times. I especially love Sgt. Bacchus's Beatle cut! Perfect!

5612443,5,B00BEZEDNU,"I began seeing this series on PBS a couple of months ago.  It didn't grab me at first but now I am hooked.  I didn't like the younger partner at first because he can be quite aggressive and thinks he knows better than his mature partner how to handle the cases.  Although it is set in the 1960's and I didn't care for that at first either, it has been interesting to see how they handle issues at that time-particularly one about discrimination that was on television.  I haven't watched all of the episodes in this collection yet but I am looking forward to doing so.",1411084800,2,568,4.330188679245283

5612456,5,B00BEZEDNU,"How does a boy become a man?

Chief Inspector George Gently of Scotland Yard came to manhood on the beaches of Anzio. But his rigid sense of ethics has got him in trouble with the higher-ups who are on the take, and cost him the life of his cherished wife. He accepts an assignment in the northeast of England (note: The opposite of the US, it is the north of England where accents take some getting used to, even for Londoner Gently).

You know that his assigned detective sergeant, John Bacchus, will be his opposite: Young, irrepressible, and given to cutting corners (such as assaulting suspects). It is 1964. England is changing, and John has come as far as his haircut. Homosexuals make him uneasy. ""Electroshock might help,"" suggests Gently. ""Nah, Guv; they just go right back,"" shrugs Bacchus. Gently regards him steadily. ""I was thinking it might help YOU,"" he says.

Abortion is still a crime.  So is attempted suicide. The death penalty will linger. If Gently tells you, ""Stand up,"" and carefully puts on his jacket and straightens his tie, you are going to be charged with murder. The viewer is not spared the hanging scene.

We meet Baccus as a newlywed with a young daughter and a powder-blue MG, the ""gift"" of his father-in-law for ""doing the right thing."" But the marriage does not prosper, and soon he is haunting the new rock-and-roll halls. His dream is to win his way to London and Scotland Yard. Gently knows what awaits him there.

So he reluctantly takes him in hand, via the most powerful teaching method of all: modeling. Bacchus watches in exasperation as ""obvious"" culprits go free -- for a time -- for lack of evidence. ""I could beat it out of him, Guv,"" he urges. Gently replies, ""We're supposed to be better than they are.""

They struggle together with the policeman's dilemma: Evidence, evidence, evidence. ""Do you want.me to go back and break in, Guv?"" says Bacchus. """"Ask me another way,"" replies Gently. ""May I have the afternoon off?"" ""Yes. Don't get caught.""

They confront communities roiled by the rise of the antisocial delinquent, a problem with us still. Bacchus could have been the worst sort -- a corner-cutting, impulsive copper. But the steady modeling of a man he respects saves him, as he will save his own young sergeant one day. Thus the string of decency twines forward, while training sessions, tests, etc. try to fill in the gaps.",1405555200,18,2382,4.736714975845411
5612457,1,B00BEZEDNU,"It is an amazing series, excellent plot and well acted but......Series 3 Disc 1 Gently Evil was blank!!!!!!!  What a pity.  I wanted to buy the next in the series but I am concerned about how many more discs will be missing.

5612470,5,B00BEZEDNU,"GENTLY HAS ARRIVED, AND THE RIDING SHOTGUN COLUMN LOOKS BEAUTIFUL!

 I'll tell you how much I love the George Gently movie series, which was released by Acorn on DVD and Blu-ray. Originally I was just going to review the latest set of Gently movies, Series Six. But I just could not write about the show without examining some of the beautifully realized films, year after year. So this ""Riding Shotgun"" column covers all six sets of the George Gently series, which star Martin Shaw as the titular DCI, who has lived through war and peacetime scattered with violent death.

 I believe that you will find my comments about the series intriguing and that the visuals will supplement that. I wanted to support this series that does not have the high visibility of a Game of Thrones or a Mad Men.

 This is a series that deserves to be well known.

You find a film by film review up on the Comics Bulletin.com website in my RIDING SHOTGUN columns.
Enjoy!
A get Gently and Bacchus already!

5612472,5,B00BEZEDNU,"George Gently, like most other British tv series, is far superior to American tv series. There is no requisite woman detective with a low cut sweater and tight pants with a big gun srapped on. The characters seem more real. Most of the men even get along with their wives and children or are widowers who miss their wives.  There is a minimum of angst. No gun battles, car chases, just an enjoyable story.",1396569600,,405,4.472972972972973

5612485,5,B00BEZEDNU,"George Gently manages to be different. On the surface, it is similar: set in the 1960s, with a younger, more foolish detective assisting him.

How is it different?

Brilliantly written, but not dwelling on witty one-liners, the characters are believable. Neither is perfect, but clearly, Inspector George Gently holds a higher moral and ethical standard than Detective Sergeant John Bacchus.

The cases themselves are ordinary enough -- usually murder with some interesting nuances. As it is set in the 1960s, the writers draw from the era for issues, police procedures and cultural milieu. While they aren't in the thick of protests and court cases, they are impacted from a distance just as anyone was then.

As is typical of British TV that makes it to the States, production values are high. Each episode is much like a movie, not rushing through plot points. The relationship between Gently and Bacchus develops show by show, never beyond the reality of each character. The viewer is always left satisfied by the show's end, waiting impatiently for the next one to be released.

I fully recommend George Gently.

5612490,5,B00BEZEDNU,"This is an excellent drama/mystery series, but what I especially LOVE is the accompanying music. For me it is a very integral part of the show, playing a major part in establishing the feel of the late 50s/early 60s in Britain. There is a lot I've never heard before, presumably British pop and soul that may have never been popular (or even heard) in the United States. It would be nifty if the powers that be put out an occasional George Gently Soundtrack.",1386633600,,458,4.530120481927711
5612491,5,B00BEZEDNU,"I really llike this series.  It is set in the late 1960's which is when I was in high school/college, so seeing the styles and hearing the music of that period is a kick.  The fact that the younger Sergeant Bacchus is the bigot and the older Inspector Gently is the ""cool"" guy is a nice twist.  Gently's character is generally the thoughtful, kind policeman, but he can kick a-- when needed.  He is trying to get his sergeant to grow up and be a better man, but it is difficult.  What woman can resist the romantic hero dealing with having lost the love of his life, but not giving up on his life or his job.  If I needed someone to investigate a murder of someone I cared about, Gently would be my first choice.",1386288000,,712,4.198529411764706

5612504,5,B00BEZEDNU,"The ""Inspector George Gently"" BBC series, based loosely on the novels of Alan Hunter, deserves repeated viewing. Superbly cast, written, and acted, the episodes feature devious murder plots set in circumstances that often also address burning social issues--for example: immigration, racism, religious bigotry, and child abuse. I am not a fan of crime series, but this one riveted my attention when I first saw part of an episode on PBS. Readers of the novels will take notice that the locale has been changed from East Anglia to Durham. Also, Gently has traded in his peppermint creams and pipe for cigarette smoking, yet Gently remains Gently. I recommend it highly.",1381968000,,668,5.137614678899083

5612518,4,B00BEZEDNU,"PBS has been broadcasting George Gently for years and all of these episodes are probably familiar to most viewers.  What sets this collection apart is it's price compared to the individual series of the first 4 seasons.  BBC home video products are almost always priced higher than other UK productions, usually averaging $10 to $15 per episode.  In this compilation the US street price comes to about $5 an episode for the same product as in the individual series.

As usual Martin Shaw brings the title character to life with his portrayal of the iconoclastic Chief Inspector.  And, as usual, many will find DS Bacchus irritating as the bagman who never seems to learn any lessons. After a while you just get used to him, but it's curious that they never explained just what Gently originally saw in this guy.  Every episode has it's share of ""Bacchus issues"".  He's not the brightest bulb in the box, is only marginally loyal, and is more than a little iffy when temptation comes a knockin'.  He's supposed to intimidate suspects but comes across as the one most likely to get the cheese beaten out of him in a confrontation. Lee Ingleby is a fine actor but I think he was miscast as Bacchus. Other than this curious lapse  the writing is excellent and is based on the stories and characters created in the Alan Hunter novels.

Set in the 1960's and beautifully filmed, each episode captures the areas in and around  Northumberland* in a manner that enhances the overall theme of individuals struggling during a period of significant social change.  While there is no particular political agenda on display a number of the episodes deal with issues that seem to disturb certain viewers, no doubt stemming from the sometimes violent class struggle affecting post WWII Britain. Labor conflicts, in particular, were much more contentious than in the US as the UK went from work houses to unionized factories seemingly overnight. These themes come from the Hunter novels and, if anything, the films tend to downplay any controversial material. But be forewarned, if you're the sort of person that likes to believe racism, homosexuality, child abuse, and abortion politics never existed in jolly old England, this might not be your cup of tea. The series is fairly limited as there's only 11 episodes spread over 4 seasons, due in part to Shaw working on the Judge Deed series at the same time.  That might change as Judge Deed has come to an end and perhaps Shaw will devote more time to Gently in the future.

All in all an excellent production that borders on the dark and somber which may not suit all tastes.  It's not a fluff piece about Carnaby St., Twiggy, pop music or any other 60's ephemera, but the writing and cinematography are first rate and the entire series has a cognitive narrative as opposed to just a collection of random episodes.  Additionally, the time period correctness is spot on as the fashions, music and cars accurately track an era of rapid social change. The only negative for some might be an over reliance on flashbacks and, more recently, cliff-hangers, as a dramatic device. One star off for the annoying Bacchus, but overall an excellent series.

*  The early episodes were filmed in Ireland as it was deemed  better suited to portray 1960's Northumberland. They subsequently relocated production to Durham during the later seasons.",1375315200,4,3367,4.844677137870855

The George Gently character is strong, honest, distinguished, as well as considerate and polite when questioning witnesses. But if the occasion calls for it, he is also capable of quick and decisive physical action. His Beatlesque young partner is quick witted and a gifted detective, but he is also overly ambitious, prejudiced, and likely to cut corners to nab a suspect. The interplay between these two characters is one of the strongest aspects of the series. I also enjoy the Northumberland setting, time period (1960s), and the accompanying music.",1522454400,,685,5.070796460176991
