7027278,4,B00U1QGJBM,"For the first time all Tarantino's great movies together in one neat box set!!!!

I myself like the way the box is made eventhough many hate it. The discs are in those cardboard slipcovers. You open the box and it's like a book. Each page you turn it has scenes from the movie and the disc is held in the cardboard slip. See others find it insane the way some dvds are packaged in that way, but you have to realize companies are never going to give in to our complaints. Just either don't take it out as much as you want to or put it in a cd case.

For some people that care alot about extras this set is not for you, otherwise BUY IT. There are few close to no extras at all on the discs. It is cheaper than buying the movies seperately though.

The Positive about this set...

1. The cool looking samuri replica sword which I am guessing is for fans of Kill Bill

2. Saving money on buying them in this set rather than seperately",1295913600,24,931,4.093406593406593

7027283,5,B00U1QGJBM,Perfect gift for Tarantino fans c: I got it for my husband's father for Christmas in 2016 along with The Hateful Eight and again for my own father for his birthday this year. Both loved it and really enjoyed it. It was even better for my husband's family since some of them speak only French.,1518220800,,292,4.327272727272727

7027286,5,B00U1QGJBM,"I actually got this bad boy box for $35 on the button.  What a collection! All movies are as listed and each are individually wrapped in their own BluRay case.  Movies appear to be as you would find them on the shelf at Walmart but are all set in a lackluster cardboard box holder.  I had many of these on DVD but did not have 3 of them at all.  In fact, I had yet to see those three (Django, Inglorious, and Deathproof). So, I got quite a deal considering I was in the market for these three and they would have cost me about as much as this whole set.  I would
probably go as high as $50 with free Prime shipping for this collection. Keep in mind, there isn't any bells and whistles with this set, but you get the single disk movies in high quality Bluray picture and this is quite a collection of iconic, cinematic and dialogue driven QT movies.  You can't go wrong with this set if Amazon keeps it at an attractive price point.  BTW, my favs are Kill Bill 1/2, Django Unchained, Pulp Fiction, and Inglorious Bastards.

7027295,1,B00U1QGJBM,"When I was a kid I ate Laffy Taffy and Pixie Stix with tons of sugar and sourness and I loved it. As an adult, it makes me sick. It is kind of that way with Tarantino movies. I used to like the video game style violence and intellectually vacuous plots that were copied like a remix samples bits of classic songs and makes a completely new song that is a shadow of the real song. Tarantino mocks and parodies classic 70's martial arts movies and various other things such as anime, and makes a new remix that is a shadow of the original with cartoon level violence thrown in and plotlessness. None of his movies will survive the test of time or the ""I am an adult now"" test.",1494720000,,674,4.1923076923076925

7027341,4,B00U1QGJBM,"Finally a great collection of films in one bundle all directed by the one and only cinema mastermind Quentin Tarantino. And at a very affordable price of just $36. I am a great admirer of QT'S films and have been wanting to collect all of them on blu ray, but until recently there was only one set available the ""Tarantino XX: 8 - film collection"" which is currently priced at $109. That's why I jumped on this set right away which goes without saying. The only difference between Tarantino XX and the Ultimate Collection is while they both have 8 films, this set contains Django Unchained instead of True Romance. Which makes more sense to me since QT only wrote True Romance and didn't direct it.

All the movies come individually wrapped and each of them contain a ton of special features. Each case has original artwork and unfortunately those annoying (IMO) security latches to keep the case from busting open if you drop it or to keep infants out of your movies. My only complaint about this set and the reason I docked it one star is because the box that holds all the movies is almost paper thin and not very durable at all. I just took it out of the shipping box and its already showing wear and creases on it. Which is too bad because I really like the design they came up with, they just should of made it more sturdy. Not a big deal just something the consumer should be aware of. I'll probably just end up throwing it away and storing the movies with the rest of my collection. Other than that I am very pleased with my purchase and if your a fan of QT and your looking for a good set to add to your collection look no further than the Ultimate Collection.",1453852800,11,1669,4.3493589743589745
7027342,5,B00U1QGJBM,"Amazing box set. The box comes a little tattered but tbh I didn't pay for the box I payed for the films and it was worth every penny. Each one comes pre wrapped, and is from Canada so I like to think of them as limited addition Tarantino movies haha tons of special features and a lot of different languages. This collection is the way to go for Tarantino films and would highly recommend buying.",1453852800,3,396,4.293333333333333

7027346,5,B00U1QGJBM,"Pretty amazing deal.  8 films from THE ultimate master of cinema for $37.00. Unbelievable!  Does this set have all the featurettes, commentary, extras, etc. that each film has when purchased separately?  Yes, it's all here.  I considered buying 'Tarantino XX', there are two extra blu-rays in that set that are dedicated to new interviews and extras not available before but I bought this set (Tarantino:Ultimate Collection) because it replaces 'True Romance' (included in 'Tarantino XX' but not on 'Tarantino:Ultimate Collection'-Tarantino wrote True Romance but did not direct True Romance) with Inglourious Bastards (included in 'Tarantino:Ultimate Collection' but not available with the 'Tarantino XX' set.)",1452988800,17,711,5.8076923076923075

7027349,3,B00U1QGJBM,Import Boxset as noted by the titles on the Disc Cases.  When received several Blu Ray cases were broken.  The outer box is flimsy and offers no protection for the inside contents.  Blu Ray discs all appear to play with English Menu's that are the same as US versions.  Disappointed that Amazon didn't give a heads up on this set.,1451952000,,330,4.45
7027350,4,B00U1QGJBM,"When viewing this item I found myself to have many questions. Upon receiving the product, I feel I have answered those questions, and would like to clear anything up I can for your potential purchase.

The only reason I have given this product 4/5 stars is because the boxing encasing the blu ray's was damaged upon arrival. This is not at all the fault of the distributor, but rather Amazon's lack of package protection. Upon opening the box, there was nothing protecting the blu-ray's from being crushed or smashed in transport, just some air packages at the bottom.

Each film comes in individual cases, all of which are presented within a nice paper cover/slip with Tarantino's mug on it. Something I'm particularly fond of is the latch found on each blue ray case to provide additional security for your blu-rays, pictured in the review. There is also original art on each blu-ray disk, as opposed to just the film title, which I am quite fond of.

Also within the blue ray case, instead of just a blank blue background, the cover art and film description are available inside in the French language! Apparently this collection is distributed by Canada so that makes sense. This was a pleasant surprise to me as I studied French and don't mind two different versions for two different languages on the box. There is also a French Translation of the film title on each blu-ray case, and on each individual blu-ray disk as well.

All in all, I am very happy with my purchase. If you are looking for more of a collector's item and better packaging quality, I recommend looking into the other Tarantino set available on Amazon.

This video, (all credit goes to J. Walden for his brilliant editing!), shows his action-packed, sharp, and brilliant resume of films:
Reservoir Dogs (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994), Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003), Vol. 2 (2004), Death Proof (2007), Inglourious Basterds (2009), and Django Unchained (2012).
Starring: Michael Madsen, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Eli Roth, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Christoph Waltz, Bruce Willis, John Travolta, Robert de Niro, Pam Grier, and Brad Pitt.

This set is a must-have for any Tarantino fan.

P.S. Thanks for reading and watching. This review is part of a series of Director Collection Reviews I'm writing.

7027376,5,B00U1QGJBM,This is a great DVD package and for the price u can't get any better. Delievery was quick. very happy,1334016000,,101,4.1
7027377,5,B00U1QGJBM,"If your a quinten fan in the least, you wanna buy this set! Its worth way more then the price. It comes in a hardcardboard casetoprotect it and its not one of those easily cracked plastic cases. The movies are of course, all his best and theres alot of extras included with each film. BUY THIS! You won't be sorry",1325721600,,313,4.233333333333333
7027378,5,B00U1QGJBM,"This is a very descent collection.  As another reviewer stated, this set doesn't have many extras.  The reason for this is (and you can tell by looking at the menus) that ""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Jackie Brown,"" and ""Death Proof"" are all the first discs of the two disc collector's editions of these items.  If you buy them separately, you'll notice that the second discs likely have more bonus features because the first disc is pretty much occupied by the movies.  ""Kill Bill"" never had many extras to begin with, so the transfers for those doesn't make a difference.  All of the discs have new labels, not part of the separate packages.  They just have the film title in red, and a character from the movie in black and white, with a black background.  All in all, it's a decent package.  If you want extras, buy em separately, but remember you'll spend more money.  Thank god this was made before ""Inglorious Bastards"" came out)",1318464000,,941,4.689024390243903
8703873,1,B00U1QGJBM,"The movies themselves are great and the price is reasonable for how many dvds are in the set, but the problem was they rarely worked correctly on my Xbox One (what I use to watch my movies on). I wished I wouldve had a warning before I dropped 50 bucks on this set before buying them. Also the titles are in French and I was not expecting that, and when I bought it, The Hateful Eight was supposed to come with it instead I got a different movie (possibly Jackie Brown or Reservior Dogs, I cant remember which wasn't supposed to get).",1533859200,,534,4.245098039215686
8703874,5,B00U1QGJBM,Thank you for putting this together. Great value!,1531440000,,49,5.25
8703875,2,B00U1QGJBM,"my copy did not have django,  instead it had two copies of inglorious bastards. :C",1531008000,,82,4.466666666666667
8703876,5,B00U1QGJBM,We were concerned it was in French but it was all English. Cool Collecter box,1530316800,,77,4.2
8703877,4,B00U1QGJBM,"great quallity, 4 stars because some features, like Pulp Fiction, has no subtitles and no second language, which is an issue for my father (he doesnt speak english)
Despite that, it has been one of the best acquisition to my collection.",1529884800,,236,4.780487804878049
8703878,5,B00U1QGJBM,Bought this collection for our son who loves all Quentin Tarantino movies and he was very pleased to receive it.,1527811200,,112,4.65
8703879,5,B00U1QGJBM,"These look like Canadian releases of all of Tarantino's movies with the exception of The Hateful 8. Nothing out of the ordinary, slipcase with 8 individually packaged Blu-ray cases.

The transfers are great, special features are decent. You can't beat the price. 50 bucks or less for 8 great movies.",1525996800,,299,4.98
8703880,2,B00U1QGJBM,Blu-Ray Collection came on time and looks great the only down side is I was missing Django and received double copies for Inglourious Basterds...,1522800000,,145,5.083333333333333
8703881,5,B00U1QGJBM,Great instant collection.,1521590400,,25,7.666666666666667
8703882,5,B00U1QGJBM,"I recently bought this collection along with Hateful Eight. My only problem is that most of the movies play to my xbox except from Django and Hateful.
Those two are locked to be played only in U.S. it seems (It is my fault for the Hateful Eight since in did not pay attention).
At least Django should be played outside of U.S. since it is in the same collection and all the other movies work fine.",1520553600,,397,4.2368421052631575
