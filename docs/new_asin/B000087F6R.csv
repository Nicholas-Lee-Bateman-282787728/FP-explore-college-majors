7979406,3,B000087F6R,"I was I avid wrestling fan in the 80's, yes I was.  But, it seems like the fizz of it went stale for me now-a-days.  At one time it used to be good entertainment for me and I used to think that somehow it might be real, you know.  I just isn't the same for me anymore.  It's now all steriods and steriods and steriods and more steroids.",1216771200,,336,3.8970588235294117
7979407,5,B000087F6R,"This dvd is no doubt one for collectors, and wrestling fans everywhere.  The dvd is great but as for someone who was there in person it is a look back on the past.  It was before Chris Jerico was Y2J, and it shows his strive to be great! I have not seen a match that he has done better then the one in this video.
  I do recommend that any wrestling fan see this it is truly amazing!",1209600000,,383,3.871794871794872
7979408,5,B000087F6R,"Though the event was held in August 1994 in Knoxville's Civic Coliseum, this evening of memories is an historic example of what territories - in this case, Tennessee - meant to fans and talent.

With the DVD clocking in at 3 hours, 50 minutes, this is a moment in time that fans of old-school wrestling will enjoy, while being a great lesson to new fans on what the industry was before ""entertainment"" became the main event.

The participants is a venerable who's who of international fame; Ronnie Garvin, Road Warrior Hawk, Terry Funk, Dory Funk, Jr., Rock-n-Roll Express and Terry Gordy. There is excellent feud summaries of Jim Cornette vs. Bob Armstrong and Thrillseekers vs. Heavenly Bodies, which ignited the territory for years, along with a special presentation for the Knoxville Wrestling Hall of Fame.

This was truly a Night of the Legends and is a must for a pro wrestling fan's DVD library.",1202169600,3,903,4.85064935064935
7979409,4,B000087F6R,"If you crave to see the stars of old but see them today then this is a great great DVD. This DVD has all of the greats from the Tennessee region of the 1960's and 1970's including ron wright, bob armstrong, but it also has chris jericho and lance storm. The matches are good and the feuds also top notch. It truly is a night of champions and I recommend you buy this DVD",1108166400,3,370,4.013513513513513
