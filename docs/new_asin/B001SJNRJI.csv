8339943,2,B001SJNRJI,"<strong>Obitameyy Ostrov</strong> (Feodor Bondarchuk, 2008)

Thirty minutes into <em>Obitameyy Ostrov</em> (released in English-spaeking countries as <em>The Inhabited Island</em>), I was wondering idly when they would introduce a plot and stop trying to wow us with the wonders of the admittedly well-spent special effects budget. The plot did appear soon after that--but unfortunately, it turned out to be a kind of mash-up of <em>Equilibrium</em> and <em>Babylon A.D.</em>. So I decided to ignore the plot altogether and just try to be wowed by the special effects a la <em>Casshern</em>. Yeah, it didn't work too well here, either.

The plot... well, I can't really tell you, to be honest. It has to do with a guy who crash-lands on a ""primitive"" (read: twentieth-century) planet and becomes embroiled in a rebellion against the planetary government. At least, as far as I can tell.

The fact that the approach I'm advocating to this film, which is based on a novel by the Bondarchuk brothers (whose <em>Roadside Picnic</em> was made into one of the best films of all time, Andrei Tarkovsky's <em>Stalker</em>), involves ignoring the plot entirely is deeply depressing. It's obvious that the source material could be done far, far better than it was, and you'd think a director as normally talented as Bondarchuk (<em>1814</em>) would have had some sense of how to approach it given that the ghost of Uncle Andrei is standing right behind him... but no. Instead, we get a sci-fi special effects extravaganza worthy of Michael Bay or Kiriya Kazuaki. In other words, if you love movies where lots of shit blows up and you can turn your brain off, you'll find this a good deal of fun. But don't go in expecting the next <em>Stalker</em> or you'll be as disappointed as I was. **",1347235200,,1779,5.04421768707483

Can't recall the last time I saw a Russian sci-fi movie. I'm sure there are plenty out there, but my exposure had been limited to war movies that still preoccupy most of my interests. The Inhabited Island however is in a class of its own.

The movie starts with the proverbial Flash Gordon image of the young and restless captain who is in search of something new in space. The conversation the young man is having with his grandma takes us quickly through the character's past, the pains of growing up and the expectation for his future. We've all been there.  But then, then we witness the beginning of everything - a monstrous collision of his ship with meteors. The young captain heroically crashes on a planet he knows little about.

Surviving a space crash is a miracle in itself, but the director doesn't dwell on it. The man is quickly out of the spaceship and exploring this new planet (which remarkably looks like modern day Earth), while his ship explodes into a million pieces. The only thing he's left with is his magic belt. Indeed it is magical as we find soon that one of the simple bullet-looking devices on it can help the man acquire exceptional language skills in a split moment.

Soon after he is captured and brought into a city, but not before saving the life of a military commander along the way from a massive explosion that looked remarkably like a terrorist act.

In the city, the captain discovers that the scientists, who he hoped to contact, exploited his mind for the sake of entertaining the masses (by testing him, extracting his memories and projecting them on the local television). There is plenty of hidden messages behind this movie, but we'll save the critical analysis for after Part 2 as the end of this movie is still in the making.

To make the long story short, the captain falls in love and with no other than the sister of the military commander who he saved earlier. Soon, forces from the ruling class (mean looking bunch that resemble members of a Nazi group) are after the young captain, but he is fortunate enough to join the military and escape them. The military however proves the wrong place for him and he embarks on a mission, to uncover the mystery of the people to the south with whom the city has been raging war for years.

End of Part 1.

I quite liked the dynamics of the movie. It was made to entertain with its colors, actions, CGI and hidden meaning. My attention was fully engaged and for this I'd give it high rating. Movies in similar fashion:

) Starship Troopers (1)
) Starship Troopers (3)
) Start Wars 4-6",1243900800,2,2643,4.559071729957806
8339945,2,B001SJNRJI,"A medium-budget sci-fi movie from Russia, one of the biggest Russian-made movies made there in recent years.  Basic English fanboy subtitles can be found online, though they're not on the DVD. It's a strange film, a sort of mix of Perry Rhodan and Starship Troopers with a bit of Dune. Deep-space fans be warned - there are almost no space-flight or space scenes, aften the opening shots. Given the strong flavour of Perry Rhodan on show here, I suspect this is a movie that will probably only work for those who live east of the Rhine. The biggest flaw is the meandering plot, which periodically saps the movie of any narrative drive.  What makes it remotely intelligent is the way that it becomes an allegory on post-Communist Russia and its politics.",1239494400,,753,4.740458015267175
