He had a later non-Western series called Rescue 8 and was famous as the family patriarch in Dallas. His female sidekick in Stories of the Century (Frankie) changed after the first season. Ostensively based on newspaper accounts, but the facts are really made up for the show. Good entertainment overall.",1324425600,,422,4.716216216216216
