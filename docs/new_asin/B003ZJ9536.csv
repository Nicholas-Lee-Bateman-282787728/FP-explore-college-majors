4234213,5,B003ZJ9536,"Episodes 37 to 72 of the series press on in a refined approach. Fist of the North Star (""Hokuto no Ken"") has heart and soul yet simultaneously also carries the elements of love and loss. In addition to those qualities the series has great character designs and is accompanied by fantastic and memorable music. The narrative is broadened by many characters and is carried out admirably with its philosophical and spiritual components. These episodes 37 to 72 really elevate the series to new heights that justly place it to the status of being called a classic.

Highly Recommended for those who enjoy animation, martial arts, and good music.",1348704000,2,641,4.935185185185185
4234214,5,B003ZJ9536,"This is the part in the FOTNS saga where it gets really good. It shows Kenshiro get into some pretty intense fights and shows some very interesting side characters. Rei and Shu come to mind. Also shows Raoh and Toki for the first time. The subtitles are pretty good. Didn't see any problems with the translations. Proper English. Minor typos if there are any. One thing to take note in these sets, well specifically the 3rd one is that sometimes skipping the chapters take you past some material. From the beginning of an episode, it takes you to the episode title and there is some stuff before those. So take note of that. But other then that, everything is there and it's a good quality release. Get this and show your martial arts and FOTNS dedication!",1319760000,2,756,4.5661764705882355

4234216,5,B003ZJ9536,"I first became addidted to Fist of the North star when Encore presented the series, two episodes at a time, each Saturday night. There's something special about seeing Ken beat up the bad guys, and with a sense of humor too.
This boxset is the second series and it is worth getting. I do wish they would have allowed us to select the different music soundtracks. but, thats not a complaint, just a suggestion.
Go watch the first series and then come back for this.",1304553600,,464,4.470588235294118
4234217,5,B003ZJ9536,This anime is the most treasured in my book. The second is Dragonball Z and Dragonball Z Kai. Everyone should see this wonderful anime action series if you can stomach the violence. thank you.,1297036800,2,192,4.676470588235294
4234218,5,B003ZJ9536,"I am a HUGE Fist of the North Star(Hokuto No Ken) fan and have been waiting for a proper US release for quite some time now!  It would seem that someone has finally gotten it right!  I have owned the international versions with terrible subtitles for awhile, and am now happy to finally see a professionally translated version!  The video has also been cleaned up quite a bit and looks like an almost new series(Animation aside of course)!  As the other reviewers have said, this is ONLY in Japanese, so if you want to see an English dub, you won't find it here.  But if you like old school 80's violent anime, and/or prefer a good action anime with the usually superior original Japanese voices, this is the one for you!!!!  Let's hope this company continues to release these DVD boxsets and finishes the series instead of halting in the middle of the series as all their predecessors seem to have done...",1293148800,2,906,4.561728395061729
4234219,5,B003ZJ9536,"The first boxed set of FIST OF THE NORTH STAR obviously got the ball rolling and is entertaining enough, but us longtime fans have long said that the first story arc is interminable (22 episodes of largely repetitive stuff), which is a problem the TV version inherited from its manga source. The simple fact of the matter is that Kenshiro's quest to rescue his fiancee from the evil martial arts maser Shin is fairly standard and it re-arranges the manga's early story struggle for no good reason, and it is not until that arc ends and flamboyant anti-hero Rei shows up that FIST OF THE NORTH STAR truly takes flight into greatness (the same can also be said of the manga). This may sound like some load of over-analyzed egghead horse hockey, but Rei provides the Enkidu to Kenshiro's kung fu Gilgamesh and the pair of them form an ass-kicking combo that is simply unbeatable. The chemistry between the two is terrific, specifically that of two hardcore masters of death who have a deep respect for each other that grows into a classic friendship. Rei became a wildly popular character with fans, offering a roguish and snarky counterpoint to Kenshiro's classical Japanese warrior stoicism, and his introduction was just the shot in the arm that the proceedings needed.

But while Rei's intro allowed for more fun to be had with the characters, the real point of the entire series is shortly thereafter brought into play, and that happens with the arrival of Kenshiro's presumed dead elder brothers, Jagi, Toki and Raoh, and from there it's an escalating opera of family dysfunction and literally deadly sibling rivalry as the brothers sort out who will become the true successor to the family's fighting style. Much like the immortals in HIGHLANDER, there can only be one active master of Hokuto Shin Ken per generation thanks to the art's super-humanly lethal capabilities, and for the first time in the style two-thousand-year history a monkey wrench was thrown into the established rites of succession by the unexpected happenstance of World War III taking place and the world consequently being rendered a post-apocalyptic wasteland. With that, the laws of the super-human martial world are thrown out of order and Kenshiro is thrust into direct conflict with two of his brothers -- the incredibly skillful and sweetly pacifistic Toki would have been named successor and he would have used his skills to heal the sick and infirm, so he and Kenshiro have no beef -- one of whom is a sadistic martial arts sociopath with a very personal grudge against Kenshiro, while the other is the world-conquering self-proclaimed ""King of Fists"" who seeks to save the world via his ""my way or the highway"" approach, and he is quite literally just about the toughest bad guy ever (who, as we get to know him better, reveals himself to be a very complex and misunderstood man). All of this forces Kenshiro to confront his eventual destiny as the world's savior while having him accrue more and more power and skill by taking on an escalating wave of ultra-sadistic and evil warlords from assorted branches of Rei's opposing martial discipline of Nanto Sei Ken, ""the Southern Cross.""

This is gripping stuff, a soap opera of sheer manliness writ crazily large, punctuated by loads and loads of creative and highly entertaining super-powered kung fu fights and exploding/dismembered bodies. We're talking wall-to-wall badassery in each and every episode, and since this show becomes one very long story from episode 23 onward (the meat of the story of Kenshiro and his brothers runs from episode 23 through episode 108) occasional half-hour segments are taken to refresh the viewers of the details of the story so far and provide histories and explanations of the various characters and their individual martial arts styles. The highlights in this boxed set include the first proper adventure involving Rei (he was introduced in the last boxed set but not yet seen to good advantage), Kenshiro's quest to put an end to Jagi's reign of terror, and Kenshiro's search for Toki, who has been imprisoned by Raoh (a truly spectacular arc, that one). All of this is compelling and chock full of violent action, so what more could you want? It's also interesting to note that in its native Japan, this series was created as a kid's show, and I cannot imagine a show aimed at children in this country ever containing an outright avalanche of literally explosive violence like that found in FIST OF THE NORTH STAR. Even by the standards of the Japanese audience (who famously enjoy things rather bloody), this series was highly controversial due to its violence, and it's rather telling that every iteration of the series that has come since the TV series and the 1986 theatrical film has considerably toned down the content. This boxed set, however, is the real thing and should not be missed.",1288656000,21,4871,4.910194174757281
8410452,5,B003ZJ9536,"First, and foremost, this series is in Japanese with English Subtitles. Only season 1 was released in the USA. However, true anime/Fist of the North Star (FOTNS) fans won't be detoured by this. If you like to read, or adapt easily, this will not bother you.

If I could give this 6 stars, I would. While the fist series was a strong 5 stars, this is even better. First box set, spends a lot of time getting to know the main characters, and centers around the Fang Clan, Shin, and Jagi as the 2 main bad guys. However, this series really starts to take off, and explore in-depth the Hokto-shin-kin's North Star history, the 6 sacred South Stars, Raie, and the relationship between Toki, Kenshiro, and Raoh.

We learn more about how Ken-Oh, aka Raoh, comes to power, and how he developed his style. We learn a lot more about Raie, as a man, and how he is one of the sacred 6 South Star Fists, and his love for Mamiya. We learn about some of the other 6 South Star Fists: Shu, and Souther. We learn just as the North Star has good, and bad brother successors, the 6 South Star's are mixed, as well.

This volume has a great many tear-jerking, and truly inspiring moments that will surely stir your soul, as a man. I will always cherish the wonderful memories the FOTNS has given me, and will remember it for the rest of my life. Hell, i may even want to be buried with the FOTNS, as being some of my most cherished memories i want to take with me to Heaven, when i die.

I don't want to say too much, but if you love brutal violent, yet truly inspiring anime, this FOTNS collection is a must. Two thumbs way, way up!! I highly recommend this.",1522886400,,1639,4.27741935483871
