8489344,1,B0000ACOY6,"I don't understand the point of telling the Nutcracker tale without the original music of Tchaikovsky, the composer of the Nutcracker Ballet. But I'm a music teacher, so I admit my musical bias quite honestly. The story of ""The Nutcracker"" was actually written in 1816 by E. T. A. Hoffman, and it was not until 1891 that Tchaikovsky was commissioned to compose music for a ballet version. If you JUST want the story, then this DVD MIGHT be ok......but really, you can do better as the animation is quite poor as well....

I picked up this DVD with the hope that I could use it in my general music class, but the music is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad that the only thing this version of the Nutcracker is good for is lighting the Yuletide log in the fireplace to sing ""Deck the Halls"" by. There are bits and pieces of Tchaikovsky's melodies, but they are interspersed with an original soundtrack. But WORST OF ALL is that all the music is performed by some type of DIGITAL SYNTHESIZER!!!!!! UGGGHHHH!!!!!!! It sounds like some cheesey early 1980's recording!!!! HAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAH!!!!!! HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!! Please, if you are going to purchase a version of ""The Nutcracker"", even one for younger children, do yourself a favor and purchase a version that uses a real orchestra for the sound track. This is nothing more than a cheap-o knock-off to try and get your money. On top of it all the animation is just as bad to boot!!!",1197417600,2,1415,4.728744939271255
