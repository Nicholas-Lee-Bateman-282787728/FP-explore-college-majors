3417699,2,6303039154,"Catherine the Great was the Prussian born ruler of Russia from 1762 until her death in 1796 and it was during her reign that Russia grew to be a super power and enjoyed its ""Golden Age"". The film, sometimes known as ""The Rise of Catherine the Great"", is a 1934 black and white historical drama that was commonplace in the 30s.

Austrian born Elizabeth Bergner (1897-1986) stars as Catherine. She was popular in German silent films and then worked with Paul Czinner in ""Husbands or Lovers"" (1924) and began her UK career and was nominated for an Oscar for ""Escape Me Never"" (1935).

FWIW - Bergner and Czinner were married when they made ""Escape Me Never"" making her one of only 5 women to be nominated for an Oscar for a film directed by their husband

Catherine has been played by Marlene Dietrich (1934), Mae West (1944), Tallulah Bankhead (1945), Julia Ormond (1991), and Catherine Zeta Jones (1995). I think Dietrich captured her best.

Douglas Fairbanks Jr. co-stars as the Duke. Fairbanks father had been one of the top stars of the silent era (""Robin Hood"", ""Mask of Zorro"", ""Thief of Bagdad"") so Junior began working early. He did a lot of relatively undistinguished work but did put in an amazing performance opposite Cary Grant and Victor McLaglen in ""Gunga Din"" (1941).

The Duke has been played by Sam Jaffe (1934), Reece Dinsdale (1991), and Hannes Jaenicke (1995). Fairbanks does a good job, but it hardly fits the historical profile. Personally I prefer Jaffe's over -the-top rendition. FWIW - Fairbanks and Jaffe worked together again in ""Gunga Din"".

Flora Robson (1902-1984) appears as the Empress. She appeared in more than 50 films and was nominated for an Oscar for her role in ""Saratoga Trunk"" (1945).  Robson appeared in regal roles in films like ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940), ""Elizabeth and Essex"" (1939) and in ""Fire Over England"" (1937). Robson is funny in her over-the-top portrayal here.

The Empress has been played by Louise Dresser (1934), Vanessa Redgrave (1991), and Jeanne Moreau (1995). I think Robson and Dresser did the best jobs, although both Redgrave and Moreau had interesting interpretations.

Austrian born Paul Czinner (1890-1972) directed 24 films between 1919 and 1966. He's best known for his work with wife Elizabeth Bergner who appeared in most of his films.

Alexander Korda (1893-1956) produced nearly 60 films in his career that started in 1923 in Hungary. His break through film was ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" (1933) and there followed a series of historical dramas including this film, ""Private Life of Don Juan"" (1934), ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" (1934) and ""Rembrandt"" (1936). Korda was known for his cheap but showy production values, which are often evident in this film, although some of the scenes are better than others.

1934 was an OK year for films. The top box office slots went to ""Viva Villa"", ""Cleopatra"" and ""The Barretts of Wimpole Street"" and ""It Happened One Night"" was the big Oscar winner. That year ""The Thin Man"" series began, Karloff and Legosi appeared in ""The Black Cat"", Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers danced in ""The Gay Divorcee"", Laurel and Hardy laughed it up in ""Babes in Toyland"",  and Howard Hawks' ""Twentieth Century"" came out.

Mordaunt Hall of the NY Times praised the film as ""expensively staged"" and noted that ""it clings considerably closer to history than do most kindred pictorial subjects"" but it ""makes an occasional attempt at mild humor, but it is without any scintillating comedy"" and Bregner ""seems too sympathetic, too coy and childish in the early scenes."" He praised Fairbanks - ""does good work"".

One of the problems with this film is that it appeared in 1934 alongside ""The Scarlet Empress"" in which Marlene Dietrich, Sam Jaffe, and Louise Dresser covered the same material with Josef von Sternberg directing and Bert Glennon on the camera. That film is an incredible example of film making, and the current film pales in comparison.

Another problem with this film is Bregner's performance which seems more suited to a comedy, and she hardly radiates the gravitas to command a nation. Without a strong women in the role, a film on Catherine the Great surely must fail.

Bottom line - Despite the attractive production and a great performance from Flora Robson, the film fails on the weakness of Bregner's performance.",1318291200,3,4319,4.94475138121547
3417700,4,6303039154,"...plays the title character in this film (also known as ""Catherine the Great"").  Her co-stars are Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Flora Robson -- who, at 32, was five years younger than Bergner, although Robson plays a much older woman, namely, Empress Elizabeth of Russia.  The empress's nephew (Fairbanks) says of her, ""She's the most shameless rake who ever wore petticoats. If she weren't on the throne she'd be on the street.""

This is a surprisingly accurate historical drama, a rarely seen film that's well worth watching.  Unfortunately, the print presented on this VHS tape is flawed -- the quality of the picture is only so-so, and 30 to 45 seconds are missing from one scene. Even so, it deserves four stars; and if the missing footage were present I would give it five stars for the fine performances of Bergner, Fairbanks and Robson.

P.S. for film buffs:  this movie was directed by Bergner's husband, Paul Czinner; they were the real-life models for Margo Channing and her husband in ""All About Eve,"" which was inspired by actual events.",1228348800,4,1047,4.887005649717514

What is the point of publishing a title and not bothering to make the transfer quality meet some minimum standard?

8270022,3,6303039154,"Alexander Korda followed his 1933 The Private Life of Henry VIII with the Paul Czinner directed The Rise of Catherine the Great in 1934. The film, then the most expensive British film ever made was a pretty standard biopic that followed convention and did quite well at the English box office.

Czinner cast his wife Elizabeth Bergner as the title character in the story of her arrival at the royal court of St. Petersburg to her accession to power following the rule of Grand Duke Peter(Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.). The film follows a pretty standard formula. And I admit I am not the biggest fan of the royal biography. After her arrival and marriage to Peter, Catherine becomes the protege of the aging Empress Elisabeth( Flora Robson) where she learns the skills necessary to rule the Russian people. While her husband Peter slips more and more into madness she captures the trust of both the Court and the military. As the situation in Russia begins to deteriorate she is chosen to be the leader of a revolt to overthrow Peter.

This is a film that is rarely seen these days due to the lack of a good restored edition. The Eclipse series presents probably the best transfer of the film that we are likely to see.  The picture quality is quite good for the age of the material but unfortunately the sound is sometimes hard to understand. Most likely due to the flaws inherent in the recording process.

While this is not a bad film it is not spectacular either. The acting is proficient and the sets by Vincent Korda are great the overall film was less than spectacular. I can recommend this one only with reservations.",1383091200,,1619,4.65034965034965

Innocent people will be sent to Siberia because of their friendship with Elizabeth! The Empress is dead. Peter reacts. Catherine can handle Peter. Advisors talk to Catherine. Later Peter sends Catherine to another apartment. She must join Peter at a reception. She is banished from the royal presence. Later she addresses her troops, they arrest Peter.

Catherine went on to reign for decades and was named ""the Great"" for her rule. ""Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely. All of the great rulers were great villains."" Did this story reflect the concerns of the audience? Read ""European Babylon"" for more history that is censored from the schoolbooks. This movie exposes the problems of hereditary life-time rule.
