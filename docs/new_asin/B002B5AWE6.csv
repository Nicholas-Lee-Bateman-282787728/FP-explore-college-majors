8360703,4,B002B5AWE6,Great telling of Cervante's classic. In this tale the donkey is the key motivator to adventure.,1470355200,,95,5.0
8360704,2,B002B5AWE6,The graphics were well done; it is a pity the story was not. To write all that is wrong with this movie would be another book; allow me to simply state I am glad I bought this used & did not pay much for it. Whoever did the preview for this movie should be congratulated; he/she succeeded in putting together the best parts of the movie so to cause us to want to see it. We were disappointed.,1424563200,,392,4.038461538461538
8360705,4,B002B5AWE6,"This is a film from Spain but seems to have made for the English market, the DVD plays first in English, not Spanish. However the writing on the outer case is all in Spanish, which makes it confusing. Unlike some other reviews I find the film to be very good, the plot held together, there was a story, there was a quest, and frankly I have seen more worse films. It is well done, yes, it is an imitation of Shrek, but it also relies on the story found in the novel Don Quixote de La Mancha, and a knowledge of the novel helps. I have read the novel. The novel is in two parts. First is his quest and his absurd adventures. Then in part two, Quixote is famous, someone named Cervantes wrote a bought about him and Quixote is both a hero and figure of ridicule. It is necessary to have read the second part of Don Quixote to know what is going on in the film. Don Quixote wants to regain his honor and find the real Dulcinea. He goes on a second quest and has a hard time persuading Sancho Panza to come along again. They go through several adventures, they are swindled several times, he almost marries a woman who thinks he has money (he doesn't), he manages to get away from her. People know he is famous and try to take advantage of him. There is a scene where some people rebuild their castle as a fairy tale castle to entice him to stay. At one point Quixote doesn't know whether to go on to Barcelona or back to La Mancha. However, Rucio, the donkey chooses Barcelona and there they go and take part in a jousting match where everyone pretends to be Don Quixote, but he is the real one. A rousing jousting match and the final knight turn to be the real Dulcinea, an accomplished knight herself, and she uses treasure to arrange everything to make a happy ending. Quizote and Dulcinea become a couple and live in a castle and Rucio lives with them, Rosante is a neurotic, cowardly horse who would rather tend to his hens. They have a chicken that goes with Quixote, Rucio, and Rosante that is braver than any of them. Among the creates they meet on their quest is a thin lion who is a vegetarian, but everyone is afraid of the lion. Poor lion. Later Rosante meets a drag queen horse that is contemptuous of Rosante.
  The film does feel like a Monty Python parody of Don Quixote, but the original novel was a comedy in of itself, making fun of all those medieval romances, so it all works. There were references to Esplandian, Oriana, and Amadis de Gaula -- all of which I understood, but it requires a knowledge of some the older romances Cervantes was making fun of to know who this characters were.
  Those that hated the movie need to read the novel and the novels Don Quixote made fun of. It is all a matter of context and knowing where the story came from. I liked it and it made sense to me.",1401840000,2,2803,4.2631578947368425
8360706,2,B002B5AWE6,My family and I were very disappointed with this movie. The animation was great. The plot and execution was awful.,1396742400,,114,4.75
8360707,3,B002B5AWE6,"Having lived in Spain for two years, I had high hopes for this movie. I was hoping for something at the level of Shrek, which might have been unfair, but needless to say I was disappointed.",1355875200,,189,4.277777777777778
8360708,4,B002B5AWE6,"I want to help any fellow Spanish Teachers out there by saying that the product description does not match the product in one very important way.  There are no subtitles on this video.  You can play the audio in either Spanish or English, but there are no subtitles in any language.",1318377600,,282,4.509803921568627
8360709,5,B002B5AWE6,My Son loves this movie which is really neat to me since its based off of real literature - he's watched it many times from our satalite recording so I ordered him a copy for his 4th Birthday. I clicked on the dvd listed 1st on amazons list and its the same price as the 2nd listing 9.99 imagine our surprise at the birthday party when we notice its actually in Spanish ... Not the title or anything obviouse on the sale listing but if you read the small print on the back then you see its NOT english... will be returning and ordering an english version. Is a Great movie but be very careful when ordering - wish it had been marked better by Amazon.,1318032000,,650,4.166666666666667
8360710,5,B002B5AWE6,"As a Spaniard I was a little skeptical of retake on the literary classic of Don Quijote. However, the project was dominated by Spaniards who are able to respect the original work and poke fun it at the same time.  My seven year old loved it and laughed his head off.  I was also impressed with the attention to detail.  For example the moon waxes and wanes along with the story accurately.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donkey-Xote/dp/B002B5AWE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donkey Xote</a>",1288051200,6,533,5.9868421052631575
8360711,2,B002B5AWE6,"Please don't put yourself through this. Even worse, don't put your kids through this. The movie tries hard to be intelligent but fails miserably. It was difficult to follow the convoluted plot which kids will never figure out. Even IF the dialog was written well, lines go by too fast to make sense of what they are talking about. Maybe it makes more sense in Spanish but I highly doubt it. Do your family a favor and pass on this one because it will be 90 minutes of your life you can never get back ;) Oh yeah, the graphics were decent.",1272758400,7,538,4.284313725490196
