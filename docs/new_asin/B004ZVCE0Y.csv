8450485,5,B004ZVCE0Y,"This was a very good written series portraying what local life was like in Wales and still is in many ways to this day and how a different culture and people came into it to live and mix with the village.

Senjeev Bhaskar is a great actor and is also very funny in the comedy series he has been in on British TV.

It shows the true colours of human beings and how views and opinions are formed by people and when people think they are right how very wrong they can be.

Great entertainment !",1367712000,,491,4.09375
8450486,5,B004ZVCE0Y,I have received the first season of this series.  I have really enjoyed the series.  I am looking forward to when the second season comes out.  I have always enjoyed watching people from different cultures enter countries foreign to them and how they interact with each other.,1346457600,,276,4.829787234042553
