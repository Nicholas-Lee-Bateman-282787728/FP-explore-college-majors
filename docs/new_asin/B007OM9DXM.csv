I highly recommend this routine, because I could feel the results. Thanks for making this available.  Barbara",1336521600,,266,4.911111111111111

""Power 4 Pink Workout"" contains four short programs:  a cardio & balance workout, a core & floor workout, and two flexibility workouts.  Patricia Friberg instructs.  She also demonstrates along with three other ladies.

The equipment required includes a six feet thera-band, (the thin and long one), and a fitness ball, (an air filled light-weight ball).  I actually used rubber tubing instead of the thera-band.  In addition, you may need a mat.

Here is the breakdown of the four programs or workouts.  Most exercises are listed.

1. Cardio Interval Balance Challenge (19:35) 4 stars: This is easy to moderately challenging.  For me, this was generally easy.  I did have a little issue with balance.  The band is used in this workout.

Walk or jog in place

2. Toning Floor Work (32:18) 5 stars:  In this challenging intermediate workout, the main focus is on the core.  This requires the use of the fitness air ball which tests your balance.  I was wobbling a wee bit with the ball.

3. Stretch And Revive Series (11:22) 4.5 stars:  The fitness air ball and a mat is needed.  These are stretches which use the fitness ball in over half of this program.

4. Breast Cancer Survivors Series (11:38):  Ms. Friberg states that this workout is ""specifically for breast cancer survivors"" ... ""to regain strength and mobility"" in the ""arm, shoulder, chest, and abdomen"".  It is a series of light or moderate stretches and gentle work.",1334275200,8,2456,4.804295942720763
8519874,5,B007OM9DXM,"I love that this workout is a full body workout.  The moves were not too difficult, but still challenging enough to make me feel like I was benefiting from the exercises.  I also liked how it is divided, so on days when I do not have as much time, I can just do parts and still feel like I got a great workout.",1432080000,,310,3.9047619047619047
8519875,5,B007OM9DXM,A good dvd. Kudos that all monies go towards a good cause!!!,1406332800,,60,4.083333333333333
8519876,4,B007OM9DXM,"Great Pilates toning dvd.  I enjoyed working out with Patricia, the exercises are not overly challenging but the ball adds extra balance challenge.  The cardio portion is about 20 minutes and you alternate between 30 seconds of cardio and toning and the toning Pilates portion is about 30 minutes and then you have the stretch portion. I usually do a combination of weight lifting, Barre, Cardio, and toning exercises. This is a good toning dvd.",1406246400,,445,4.92
8519877,4,B007OM9DXM,"A lot of variety here. Pilates, cardio, yoga, barre.. Patricia is a good instructor as well.  Lots of variety and feels very feminine too.",1393027200,,138,4.75
8519878,4,B007OM9DXM,"This DVD recording seems to be low quality.  I have not been through the complete workout, but the quality of the recording is poor.",1379894400,,132,4.5
8519879,3,B007OM9DXM,This workout is for all levels.  They participants onscreen vary from beginner to expert so you can modify the moves to fit your level.  I didn't think it would make me sore but the next day my muscles were screaming!,1364947200,,217,4.4
8519880,5,B007OM9DXM,"Whats NOT to love about Power 4 Pink!
Patricia is a gem and her energy, passion and YEARS of experience clearly shines through in this DVD. No ""fly by night wanna-be"", Patricia Friberg is the real deal, delivering dynamic cardio, strength training, toning, and challenging balance poses in this 80 minute video. All my favorite moves too!!! I love finding workout videos that include moves that I am familier with. Like with all fitness training, depending on how involved, engaged and the amount of effort YOU put in, is how much YOU will get out of this... so I went for it, and let me tell you, I take my workouts seriously, and this workout DVD was seriously AMAZING!!! I LOVED IT and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone that is looking to get fit, have fun, and see results! Pop this baby in the player 3 to 4 times a week and you will NOT be disappointed with the results!",1360972800,,878,4.459627329192546
8519881,3,B007OM9DXM,"I traded this workout after one try.  Wasn't for me, and I cannot recommend it.  There are several reasons.
 For one, the production quality is poor.  I would find that overlookable if I liked it in other respects.
The ball is awkward to use in many of the positions it is used in this video.  (Though it is, I think, a beneficial challenge where you manage it.)  Without the ball (and you can modify by not using it) it is boy a very creative workout.

My primary reason for disliking this is its lack of glow and organization.  The cover states that it is divided into four sections.  But its really only three chapters. And those chapters aren't equal in terms of time (one is well over half an hour).  There's no real rhyme or reason to the way workouts are grouped.  I felt as if she was making it up as she went along.  Also, its irradic in terms of difficulty level.  Tougher moves and too easy moves.

Positives:  supports a great cause.  Suits small workouts spaces, is low impact, and instructor is likable.  Cueing is good but not great (would give her a B+ for curing).",1360454400,3,1081,4.378787878787879
8519882,5,B007OM9DXM,"Patricia is an excellent teacher and her energy and enthusiasm are clearly conveyed in this DVD.  I take her classes at Yogaworks and she never fails to challenge and push us while making the hour long class fly by. This DVD allows me to get the same feeling  without having to leave my house.

This workout caters to varying fitness levels; those without much fitness experience as well as including modifications to increase the difficulty for a much harder workout.  I definitely sweat During the cardio balance challenge and my core/abs were sore from doing the toning floor section.

Note: You'll need a long theraband and a small fitness ball, although the workout can be done without there items.",1339632000,,703,4.873949579831932
8519883,5,B007OM9DXM,The workout is easy to follow and fun to do!  I didn't have a ball but was able to make it work anyway's.  My sister is a breast cancer survivor and I recommended it to her.  It would be a great compliment to her marathon training. I feel more toned and stronger every time I do it!,1338768000,,282,3.912280701754386
