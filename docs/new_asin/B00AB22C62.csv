5408405,4,B00AB22C62,"Robert Carlyle is a tremendously talented actor who too often gets relegated to character roles - usually some variant of a violent psychopath.  And as much fun as he is to watch in those roles, he obviously has much more scope as an actor so I was really looking forward to seeing him anchor this movie in the lead role.  Even more promising: the screenplay was apparently written with Carlyle in mind. The movie gets off to a very promising start with Carlyle giving an understated, utterly believable performance as Lachlan MacAldonich, burned-out former Britpop rocker now working on an organic farm in southern California. Lachlan is a charming, troubled, complicated, deeply flawed man forced to come to grips with his past after a decade of hiding from it. Alas, about halfway through, this nuanced character study turns into a heavy-handed cautionary tale about the perils of alcoholism. The character's drunkenness is employed as a kind of shorthand to illustrate how messed-up he is. Sadly, with Lachlan stumbling drunk through the second half the movie, we lose any further examination of the character's other (more interesting) demons. Despite that major flaw, the film is still worth checking out, if only to enjoy the beautiful acting by the always-captivating Robert Carlyle. The rest of the cast (if not the writing) is also very strong, especially A Martinez as Lachlan's long-suffering boss at the farm and Savannah Latham as Lachlan's estranged 14-year old daughter. The movie is beautifully filmed on location in parts of southern California rarely seen in the movies",1364083200,2,1588,5.127413127413128
5408406,5,B00AB22C62,"What a great talent Robert Carlyle is.  Like life, the film is unpredictable and bitter sweet.  Carlyle's character is well rounded and stirs a range of emotions.",1363737600,,162,4.962962962962963
5408407,5,B00AB22C62,I have been waiting for a year to see this movie and it was worth the wait!  Robert Carlyle is wonderful in a charming and self-destructive way.,1363478400,,144,4.333333333333333
5408408,1,B00AB22C62,"Although the acting was good, the story was dark and depressing. It moves very slow and has no point by the end...just sad. I wanted to like this movie based on its synopsis but I would not recommend this.",1363132800,,205,4.282051282051282
5408409,3,B00AB22C62,"As a Robert Carlyle fan, I looked forward to this film and as a fan I would say he has done well at playing yet another dark role. Had his character been something other than the lead, then the one dimensional treatment given the character wouldn't have been so bad. As it is we know little about the lead character other than he is an alcoholic. And from there the storyline is quite predictable. Carlyle is on game by making you care about the character even though the outcome is very prescriptive.",1363046400,,501,4.456521739130435
5408410,5,B00AB22C62,"The acting in this film was superb. Truly layered and nuanced. The plot was very well written, and there was enough humor throughout to offset the serious parts. This is a movie with heart and depth, that will make you laugh, cringe, smile, and hope. Robert Carlyle is tremendously raw and honest in his portrayal.",1363046400,3,314,4.7272727272727275
5408411,5,B00AB22C62,"I watched this film because of Robert Carlyle.  The movie is quiet and unconventional, but I was completely absorbed in the story.  This is a study of his character, for whom I occasionally cheered and more often cringed.  Lachlan is hardly sympathetic, but the raw humanity and sensitivity brought by Carlyle did make me want to know Lachlan better and hope his situation would improve. As far as pure drama, this is definitely one of the better ones, and Robert Carlyle's performance a tour de force.",1362787200,2,502,4.813953488372093
5408412,5,B00AB22C62,"This is NOT a construtive review cause I can't be bothered right now but this film needs to be seen! Why?! Ehm, HELLO, Robert effing Carlyle!! Nuff said, people!! Now, click order!!",1361923200,2,181,4.6875
5408413,4,B00AB22C62,"This 95-minute film was an ""Official"" selection at Sundance and probably played many other film festivals. It's definitely an independent film on a small budget. Its 30 locations were shot in an amazingly short 21 days.  (You learn this from the ""Making of..."" featurette in the DVD bonuses.

The one ""name"" actor is Scottish actor Robert Carlyle (who I must admit has an accent thick enough that I know I missed some of his dialogue. And, there are no ""subtitle options"", which might have helped). He's well-known but was new to me. His character, Lachlan MacAldonich, was in a UK rock band with his brother but - for reasons you will learn in the film - he left the band (well, it broke up) and has been living in California (outside LA ) for the last 10 years. One think you learn about Lachlan is that he drinks a lot. (If the liquid consumed in this film was real alcohol, a good portion of the budget would have been spent on it.) Writer/Director Marshall Lewy intends for Lachlan's character to be one that some of the audience take compassion for and other see him as a loser. He does make some really stupid moves. I won't go into details that will tell you how the story ends. That would give away too much.

There are other characters in Lachlan's life in the film but they are - in my opinion - thinly drawn. The main one is Beau - who is described on the package as being ""a lovely struggling actress"". I don't ever remember her ""occupation"" being mentioned in the film but the central part of the story is that both Lachlan and Beau each have ""problems"" and may save each other. Lachlan's problem is of course his alcoholism but all we know about Beau is that she has ""some bad days"". (At least I couldn't figure out what her problems were.). Near the end we meet Lachlan's ex-wife and teenage daughter and the story changes again. I like independent films and gave this one a chance and the time was well spent. But I kept getting the feeling that Director Lewy was so excited to get a ""name"" actor in his film, that he concentrated on Lachlan so much he left loose ends for the other characters. (He gloats about Carlye signing on to the film in that ""Making of ... short"".

As noted above there is the nine-minute ""Making of.."" short as well as A (just one) deleted scene lasting 2  minutes. The theatrical t5railer is there too. That's it for bonuses.

I'll recommend this to those who like to take a chance on  American independent films. But it's not perfect.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5408414,5,B00AB22C62,"In the press notes for California Solo, writer-director Marshall Lewy defines ""FEAR"" as an acronym that can mean either: ""f*** everything and run"" or ""face everything and recover."" Perhaps, more than anything, that is the underlying theme of his new movie California Solo. Starring Robert Carlyle in a mesmerizing performance, California Solo traces the first steps of one faded former Britpop rocker from once sense of fear to the other.

When we meet the movie's central character Lachlan MacAldonich, whom Carlyle infuses with equal portions of self-loathing and charm, he is living a comfortably numb existence. Carlyle is perfectly cast as Lachlan, the Scottish former lead guitarist in a ""big deal"" `90s British rock band, the Cranks. The band's real ""big deal"" was Lachlan's older brother, the Cranks lead singer Jed, who died tragically of a drug overdose years earlier in L.A.

By night, Lachlan hosts a rather morbid podcast called Flameouts, honoring the world's great musicians, tragically dead before their time: from T-Rex's Marc Bolan, to that most tragic of composers, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. But, the one flameout Lachlan's not yet profiled is Jed; the memory of his brother's death is still too keen and raw, even more than a decade later, as Lachlan feels responsible (with good reason) for the overdose that killed him.

Since Jed's death, Lachlan hasn't been home to the U.K.--never faced family, friends, and fans. Nor really himself. Now an expat with a green card, in this self-imposed exile, hiding from his past and himself in Antelope Valley, California, Lachlan works on an organic farm owned by Warren (A Martinez in a gentle, sympathetic performance as Lachlan's patient boss).

That ""comfortably numb"" existence, and a steady diet of beer and Scotch, seems to be the only way Lachlan can live with himself, getting drunk nightly alone in his tiny hovel of a home or at the local bar. On one such night, Lachlan is pulled over and charged with a DUI; his problems are only just beginning.

A barely-remembered marijuana possession charge from years earlier threatens him with deportation unless he can prove himself valuable to someone--anyone--who is a U.S. citizen. As Lachlan confesses, ""I can't think of anyone who would give a toss whether I'm here or not."", Lachlan reluctantly turns to his estranged ex-wife Catherine (Kathleen Wilhoite) and daughter Arianwen (Savannah Lathem)--whom he hasn't seen since she was three years old--as his last desperate hope against facing the music back home. It's a tricky path for him to take, full of emotional landmines, and, ultimately, there are no easy answers for him.

There is also an ongoing flirtation between Lachlan and Beau, a farmer's market customer. It would have been easy to take the relationship to its logical end and land them in bed. But it really rings true that it doesn't wind up that way. Lachlan is clearly so screwed up at this point and so self-destructive at this point, it's hard to imagine him pursuing it, even though he might desire it. It's an interesting narrative choice, but it makes a lot of sense, even though it might contradict conventional wisdom (and frustrate those of us more romantic souls).

And in the end, as well, the film's resolution doesn't necessarily go where the audience might expect either. There are no neat bows to tie up the shattered remains of Lachlan's life, yet it's not completely bleak. There are no pat answers; it's a hopeful, yet truthful. Lewy leaves filmgoers with a sense that he's evolving and that he is going to go face his past.

California Solo, more than anything, is a carefully drawn character study of a middle-aged man stuck in a 15-year old nightmare much of his own making. To say that Robert Carlyle's performance is stunning is not hyperbole; it's simple fact. He's in nearly every frame of the 97-minute film; we can't avoid getting pulled into the chaos of his life. One moment, we feel terrible for him; at another, we want to shake him and tell him to grow up, for heaven's sake!

We want him to find some peace, even as he refuses it in a self-destructive downward spiral intensified by his current problems with immigration. And whether he is wallowing in a drunken stupor of self-pity, raging about his immigration situation, shyly and ineffectively courting a beautiful young woman, or trying to reconnect with a daughter he barely knows, it's all there played out behind Carlyle's soulful eyes. He hits every emotional beat true and natural in a brilliant performance.

The actor always manages to find the humanity and vulnerability in every character he plays, but California Solo gives Carlyle the opportunity to exhibit the full range of his mastery. He doesn't miss a beat; none of it feels forced. It is gorgeous, naturalistic acting at its finest.

Ultimately, California Solo should be appreciated for the beautiful character study it is at its core, and the exquisite, heartbreaking performance of its lead actor. Not a huge, raucous rock movie, but rather a melancholy and not-too-sweet ballad of a film.",1358208000,32,5084,4.997635933806147
5408415,5,B00AB22C62,"A lovely but angsty movie of a former rock star's life spiralling out of control after he's picked up for drunk driving and threatened with deportation. After years of merely existing, he's finally forced to confront the past that led to his brother's death. A riveting performance by Robert Carlyle. An open ending in desperate need of a sequel!",1436832000,,346,4.88135593220339
5408416,4,B00AB22C62,"I didn't care for the ending; felt like nothing really got resolved, especially with the potential love interest. But Bobby was terrific as usual. Would recommend just for the adorable Scottish drunk bits, the singing, and the frequent accented expletives!",1436400000,,256,5.425
5408417,3,B00AB22C62,This was a really well done flick. Robert Carlyle is the man. He really drew out the emotions.,1435276800,,94,4.277777777777778

5408423,4,B00AB22C62,"This film follows Lachlan MacAldonich, a former British rock star, through the inevitable resolution of a lifetime of bad decisions. This isn't a fairy tale; though far from sunny, the promise of a second chance does appear before the film's end. The expertise of this tiny shred of hope adds to the film's authenticity and emotional impact. Carlyle's performance is deeply honest, and he seems perfectly at home with MacAldonich's rage and fear and regret. The linear narrative expressed isn't what a typical movie-goer would expect, but it works here thanks to an incredibly human story and a good supporting cast. Though there isn't much new ground to tread with the life of a rock star gone wrong, California Solo manages to find its footing in this soulful, truthful tale.",1382918400,2,777,4.984615384615385
5408424,5,B00AB22C62,"I knew nothing about this film and had never heard of Robert Carlyle.  So I was amazed at his mesmerizing performance.  This is a story about a former British rocker who has had a season of success, apparently, with his band, until his brother died.  Now we see him, strangely, working as a laborer in an organic farm somewhere on the outskirts of LA.  He's no longer young, his face is lined, his hair is thin and has a lot of gray in it.  But he still has a certain charm, especially when he's been drinking and he seems to be a good hearted lad.  The Scottish accent, as he says, makes Americans trust him.  I don't about that but it goes a long way towards likability.

Carlyle's performance is the main reason to see the film but the story itself is nicely told, realistic and has a satisfying resolution.  There are some lovely shots of the farm.  Most of the supporting cast is good, with the possible exception of the love interest. I recommend it.",1382227200,2,956,4.380681818181818
5408425,5,B00AB22C62,"Really loved Robert Carlyle's performance in this film. I heard that it did very well in the Sundance Film Festival and being a fan of Robert Carlyle for quite sometime now, I had to see it for myself. He really did an excellent job at portraying a rock star that had it big and then fell out. Lots of people don't exactly realize that there are tons of men/women that are battling through this exact same story. Robert just performed this struggling addict so well, you kind of wonder if it ever happened to him in his career. See it!",1377907200,2,535,4.36
5408426,4,B00AB22C62,"Very much an ""artsy"" character piece. Carlyle gives a masterfull performance as a very fallible, burned-out rocker whose life is anything but idyllic. The ""feel good"" in this movie requires a bit of work to find but it's worth the effort if you enjoy portayals of life as it might be.

A supporting performance by Kathleen Wilhoite also adds a bit of flair in my eyes. I admit that she was one of my favorite parts of ""Road House"", that '80s Patrick Swayze vehicle.

""California Solo"" is definately not your standard Hollywood fare... more like something you'd hear buzz about at Sundance or Telluride. So if you enjoy indy art movies, ""California Solo"" should be your list of movies to watch.",1373760000,4,693,4.7190082644628095
5408427,1,B00AB22C62,I did not found this movie to be interesting at all. As a matter of fact of was pretty much bored. The movie script was just  poor.,1372464000,,131,3.8518518518518516
5408428,4,B00AB22C62,"This was a cool flick.  It didn't have the typical mainstream BS yet had the production quality that without,  normally makes these smaller movies unwatchable.  I enjoyed it.",1371686400,3,174,5.142857142857143
5408429,5,B00AB22C62,What can I say. I love Robert Carlyle and he did not disappoint in this movie. It was endearing and well worth watching,1369872000,3,119,4.217391304347826
5408430,4,B00AB22C62,"This film, starring Robert Carlyle, premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival and went on to win several awards at other film festivals. After watching the movie, I'm not surprised it received such acclaim. It's a terrific character study about an endearing former rock star I couldn't help but feel for. Carlyle's ability to convey MacAldonich's internal and external struggles was mesmerizing. Even when he didn't speak a word, his body language said everything. As expected, Michael Des Barres' role as the former manager of MacAldonich's dissolved band was delightfully charming. And at one hour and 35 minutes, this movie doesn't overstay its welcome. I highly recommend you check it out.",1369526400,3,696,5.2792792792792795
5408431,4,B00AB22C62,"Very well acted. Unfortunately it was too well acted for me as the problems the main character faced rang so painfully true that I couldn't finish it! However, I couldn't fault the film, great acting, very well thought out story.",1368057600,3,229,4.75
5408432,4,B00AB22C62,"This movie is all about Robert Carlyle's acting.  It's not about the script, photography, directing, editing or sound.  The production values are okay.  This is Marshall Lewy's first film directing, so I can cut him some slack for inexperience.  The message about how alcohol ruins your life is strong.  Guilt made this character the drunk he became, and the two combined are the self-imposed prison that he uses to punish himself for his brother's death.  It's a sad story, but a must-see for Carlyle fans.  It is not a film that I will watch over and over.",1367107200,,558,4.690721649484536
5408433,2,B00AB22C62,"After watching A Better Life - this film failed to grab my attention.  This movie lacked the emotional depth, relevance, and heartache that A Better Life evoked. Robert Carlye is a fine actor but this role didn't ask him to do much.",1364515200,,232,4.523809523809524

I'm a Californian, born & raised here... so it was a lovely and familiar setting for me. And I absolutely loved Robert Carlyle's character...his human foibles, his emotions, his frustration... you really feel for him. He's an extremely talented actor. (love his accent too...) I love the introspection as the film goes along, Lachlan having to deal with the consequences of his actions, as well as confronting where his life went off track... and his regrets.
