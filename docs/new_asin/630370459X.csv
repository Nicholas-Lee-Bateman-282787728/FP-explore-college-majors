7853711,4,630370459X,"The film is not a film. It is a radio show. Derek Jarman is dying of AIDS and he tells us how he sees his disease and his coming death. For him the color is blue, because blue is the sky, it is absolute limitless space and it is the perfect color for going to the other side of the gate or door or portal you have to cross on your last breath. After that point you do not need to breathe any more.

The story, if it is a story, is poignant but told on a rather desultory tone and with as much poetry as possible. He explains what this disease means for him and probably for many others in his case. He repeats the names of the men he has loved and who may have infected him or who he may have infected. Sad and tragic that love led to death. I say love and I follow Derek Jarman on that term, but in fact it was not love. It was sexual intercourse and most of the time nothing much more in those post 68 years when everything was possible and everyone was doing it. Well everyone, not, really, but many considered promiscuity as a norm and bisexuality as a must.

As Derek Jarman says he has to resign himself to the disease and the coming death. The drugs used in those years were very experimental, had tremendous side effects and were nothing but tinkering about with what doctors had under their hands and fingers and research went very slowly, when it was funded, which was not the case everywhere in the world.

And then Derek Jarman has to come to terms with his life, what he had done, what he would have done, what he did not do, and he has to build a balance sheet of his work: has he achieved enough for his films to survive his own death? Probably, though some of these films are aging rather fast. And then he has to push suicide aside and he has to cope with the pain and try to find some peace of mind to move on and pass to the other side in serendipity. And his telling his last moments of consciousness on this planet must have helped him to find some catharsis with death.

Apart from that the radio show that is behind this constant blue screen is a testimony of a social and human situation and it is nothing else. The testimony is done with great talent but it is being carried away by the wind of time. The situation does not have any duration in itself. It is already in the past for the countries where safe sex is a real objective and the present treatment is available. It will not cure you but it will give you a more or less normal life for quite a good number of years.

But it remains necessary to revisit what it was in the past not to slacken our efforts to find a real cure.

""Glitterbug"" is only a montage and collage of tit bits from Derek Jarman's personal super eight and video documents he left behind after his death. This film is a testimony about him and his work and life in order to pay our respects to the departed filmmaker.

Apart from that dimension the film does not really bring anything new about the man or his films. And since it was not professional camera work, it is not even comparable to his work. So this documentary gives us an intimate vision of the man and the people around him and this is a good thing to give some human depth to a man who went away too fast.

7853712,3,630370459X,"As I complete watching all of Derek Jarman's films, I have to admit that ""Blue"" was , for me, the most undefinable of them all.  You stare at an aquamarine-coloured screen for 70+ minutes and listen to the sights, sounds, feelings, experiences and memories of film director Derek Jarman who has lost his sight due to AIDS complications, and will soon die from the disease.  It reminded me of the scene from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brainstorm/dp/B00004VVN9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brainstorm</a>&nbsp;when Louise Fletcher is suffering a fatal heart attack and records all of her brain activity to her dying body!

""Blue"" was very thought provoking and very melancholic at the same time.  Because I have been hypnotized before and am easily hypnotizable, I had to start this film several times, as I would nod off from staring at the blue screen.  This is a very interesting choice for the late Jarman to have made.  I cannot really say that I ""enjoyed"" it.  I can say that I ""experienced"" it.  I wondered about the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iris/dp/B000067J3R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iris</a>&nbsp;with Judi Dench, as she portrayed brilliant wordsmith-authoress Iris Murdoch as her brain slipped away from her due to Alzheimer's.  Jarman's film is a meditation and observation on the ""slipping-away"" process.  Interesting, but definitely not for everyone.  I still recommend the at least one time experience of it to appease curiosity.",1207440000,2,1546,5.950226244343892
7853713,4,630370459X,"Much has been written about this fine work, the last by innovative British filmmaker Derek Jarman.  A rumination on AIDS, produced when he was rendered blind by the disease, the film consists of a soundtrack of Jarman's narration surrounded by a collage of music and sound effects; the screen itself is just the color blue, never changing during the running time of the film.  Seen in a darkened theater, the blue screen almost staring at you, ""Blue"" is a very moving experience - you're really put in Jarman's shoes as he takes a journey through a terminal illness that has robbed the filmmaker of his sight.  On home video, the impact of what some have criticised as a ""gimmick"" might be minimized, but ""Blue"" is a remarkable achievement worthy of checking out.  Turn out the lights, screen it on a big tv to fill the room with the solid color and give it a try.  It might surprise you.",1148428800,,888,4.559748427672956
7853714,4,630370459X,"""I fall into a blue funk..."" says the narrator about 10 minutes into this film. An understatement by far. Blue is a brooding spoken-word epic that traces the mind of a person (Jarman himself) who is in the advanced stages of AIDs. Jarman died from AIDs-related causes in 1994. The text, excerpted from Jarman's sublime book about color, CHROMA, riffs on the nature of the color blue--literally and metaphorically. These are melancholy, but not necessarily sad, meditations on the various ""blues"" the speaker has experienced throughout his life in general and his sickness in particular. True to the visionary nature of many of Jarman's films (The Last of England and Jubilee, for instance), Blue is a lush, experimental tour-de-force: there are no images accompanying the dialogue in this film, only an empty, glowing, aqua-marine blue screen that overwhelms the potential sadness of this film with a Tabula-Rasa like radiance. Aesthetically, this is a beautiful, but radical choice; viewers of this film will have to focus entirely on the fragmentary dialogue, without the help of images to keep distractions at bay. Politically, this choice sums up Jarman's artistic modus operandi: he is interested in work that leaves plenty of space for the viewer's imagination to fill in the narrative blanks. Jarman's empty blue screen shows the director working to not pin-down the experience of sickness and death too firmly. My only criticism of this films is that sometimes the dialogue becomes too melodramatic, undermining the understated visual component, All in all, however, Blue is an intoxicatingly morose film that, in spite of the lack of images, manages to engage the viewer throughout its duration.",984355200,13,1704,5.245421245421245
