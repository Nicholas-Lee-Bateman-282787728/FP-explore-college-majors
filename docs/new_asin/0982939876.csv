174386,5,0982939876,This is a great Bible study; I recommend it to all churches.  It would be amazing to see what would happen to Christians in this country if our churches studied this.,1331337600,2,166,4.354838709677419
174387,4,0982939876,"Not a Fan is an outstanding resource for discipleship. I was very impressed by the high quality of the drama and by Kyle Idleman's honest and provocative teaching.

174388,5,0982939876,"Our church is presently showing this video series weekly. I was so impressed with it and could not wait another week to see the next video that I ordered entire set. If you are wanting to radically change how you view yourself as a Christian then purchase the set. If you are satisfied with the hum drum daily walk you may now experience then I do not suggest you spend the money. Our pastor said that it might clear out some of the people from our church once they viewed it. I agree because some people call themselves Christians and yet they have not experienced the fullness of being a follower of Jesus Christ. I needed a change in my walk because I honestly fell under the being a fan and not a follower. That disturbed me greatly because I asked myself how willing I was to make sacrifices like the main character in the video was willing to do. It cost him everything but in the end the joy he experienced as a believer was so endearing and so powerful to witness. Yes, it is a story. But it can be about any one of us who is just getting by as a Christian who is not empowered and who has never allowed the true Christian experience to reach our hearts. It has to be a head and a heart experience to truly call ourselves believers in Him. Someone here asked what comes with the study. You get the dvd's that have six weeks of study and each builds on the previous week telling the story of this young man who had to have a heart attack to realize he was not where he was supposed to be. You also get the Not a Fan journal which is good to write in each day of the six week study. You can look back and see what you have learned each week and I advise you not to take this lightly. I am a journal writer anyways and so keeping it up was not too difficult. I guess what it boils down to is this...are you satisfied with where you are at as a Christian? Are you just a fan of Jesus Christ or do you desire to really commit and be His follower regardless of what it costs you? Sadly, many are destined to remain in the fan column but I could not stay there personally any longer. It impacted me so much I ordered a set for both my grown children and I pray they watch it and also realize they need change in their walk to. I hope this helps whoever is sitting on the fence about spending almost $50 to order this set. Do not buy the pastors set because I did thinking it had the weekly videos in it and I had to reorder the group study set to get the entire study on dvd.",1330041600,37,2476,4.055102040816327
174389,5,0982939876,"One of the best Christian t.v./movie type things I've ever seen!  The spiritual value in this product is too high for me to even try and quantify.  ""Baby"" Christians as well as mature ones will find value here.  This can literally be a ""life changing"" product - and I don't say that lightly at all.  An EXCELLENT study either for church groups or individuals.

There are 6 episodes that are each 30 minutes long (give or take).  The 6 episodes weave together a very interesting story that will draw you in immediately, and when you reach the end of 1 episode you will find yourself WANTING to see the next one to find out more.

Although the cost of this is expensive (at least $50 at this writing) and after ordering I wondered if I would regret it, I found it worth every penny and actually much more! However, from a practical perspective, it really bothers me that the creators would price it so high, as that fact alone, by necessity, will GREATLY limit the amount of ministry potential that this excellent product has.  I don't know if the creators/Kyle Idleman realize that or not, but they need to.  This is a series that all Christians should watch.  But at such high prices, many that otherwise might, won't due to the price - which is a real shame given the vital importance of the message which it was developed to bring.

Note: There is a Not a Fan ""movie"", which is much less expensive - I have watched it also and while it is OK (it is missing approximately half the footage), I do not believe it is nearly as effective as the study.

Although this is billed as a ""small groups study"" that was developed for churches - and I believe it would be excellent when used that way - it can just as easily be viewed independently at home (that's what I did). In fact, it might even be more effective that way.  Personally, I watched one a day and after watching each one, I mentally went through the included guide & exercise book, both of which ask some good questions and had some worthwhile exercises that I found truly helpful to help reinforce what I watched. In general they were an excellent companion to the DVD.  With that said, I do have one warning: Personally I believe a few of the ""crazier"" exercises that are suggested in the companion book are not only not wise to do, but can open doors to the enemy that shouldn't be opened. The exercises that say things like ""this may seem awkward to do, but do it anyway"", I believe you should be very careful with doing them - please make sure you are very sensitive to the Lord on those things - our words and actions matter a lot (far more than we often realize) and although the intended goal of those exercises is good, some of them I believe can actually, albeit in ignorance, possibly open doors to the enemy.  For instance, one of the wilder exercises suggests creating an altar to things you might be enslaved such as alcohol and trying to worship at that altar.  The goal of the exercise is noble - it is to have you realize how silly it is to actually worship something like alcohol.  But I personally believe such actions are unwise, even in such a context.

All in all, this is an EXCELLENT show/study with a message that couldn't be more timely for the Church right now.  Highly recommended!

174428,4,0982939876,"I really liked this study. My Junior High youth group was on the fence about it; mostly because of the videos. I have an odd mix this year of 6th and 8th graders (no 7ths). The older kids really enjoyed the testimonials and seemed to be able to relate to the content well. The discussion guide was great for getting them talking and really thinking about how they were living their life and how they wanted to change (and what they were already doing that was good).

The younger ones complained that the videos were ""too long"" but I think the issue actually was that the testimonials, especially, were taped and then edited to be choppy and ""modern"" but perhaps a little difficult to follow if you're 11 and diagnosed with ADHD (which was my main group of ""complainers"")

All-in-all, I'd recommend this for youth who are 8th graders and higher (I think even young adults would benefit from this particular ""teens"" series); mature enough to be honest and contemplative about the materials. This isn't by any means a ""fun"" study. It requires a lot of self-reflection and there are no ""fun"" activities included to keep kids participating. We did come up with a few activities to make the lessons more concrete, which helped, but those were things we as leaders had to do solo.

A word of warning; one of the testimonials deals with sexual sin. Many of our kids were very uncomfortable and unsure how to respond to what they had just taken in. It helped to spawn a debate in our group that I wasn't entirely comfortable with; because of potential parent reactions, etc. It also lead to a lot of ""judginess"" from some of the kids in our group that needed to be redirected into productive conversation within the group. Do your homework and review all materials for the this study before presenting it to your group (no matter the age). I was rushed one week and didn't do that- which turns out to be the same week that I showed the testimonial for the girl that struggled with homosexuality.",1406505600,12,1987,4.607344632768362

Kyle Idleman has a unique approach to seeing and getting to know God. How do you talk to God? Do you approach Him as someone to fear? Or someone more like a friend? Pretend God is in the chair next to you, do you see Him? Look harder. Now pray & talk to Him as if He were your best friend.

Our group had been together 6 months before we started this impactful series. We became intimate with God, ourselves and shared with each other.

The DVD is a must for all, especially visual learners. The thought provoking DVD was powerful from bursts of joy to tears of sadness.

I would not recommend this series to a group that is just starting. It is also imperative for the leaders to read the easy to follow leaders guide entirely and review at least one week in advance. For the best impact-the leaders should complete their lessons 2 weeks before the group. It was helpful to explain to the group, ""This week we will do...together. I found day 4 will take you some extra time.""

Even though there are 6 lessons, some lessons we took two weeks to complete due to their intensity & length. Perfect for the 10 week/quarterly group.

Would I recommend this series? Absolutely!!",1377216000,2,1350,4.445344129554656

7795120,1,0982939876,"I would suggest previewing this dvd series on youtube before purchasing. In a nutshell, Kyle Idleman preaches only about what you must do for Christ, and zero about what Christ has done for you.  What you will find is that Kyle Idleman consistently points his listeners to check the validity of their own faith by evaluating their ability to fully love, submit, and commit to Christ, and the zeal with which they carry their own cross (the formula for this evaluation is a mystery), rather than pointing them to Christ and His perfect love, submission, and commitment to us and to carrying His cross on our behalf.  Kyle goes so far as to say that THE message of Christ's cross is that we are to take-up our cross and follow Jesus.  He not only guts the message of the Gospel from Christ's Cross, he neglects to proclaim the gospel in any form throughout the dvd series -- the very message that the Spirit uses to create and grow the faith that Kyle is so desperate for us to have.  He focuses soley on the fruit the cross produces in the Christian, without even remotely rooting it in the central teaching of the cross -- Christ crucified and raised to life for the absolution of sinners. Contrast Kyle's human-centered, works-centered theology of the cross with the theology of the cross as the Scriptures teach:

5 Ways the Theology of the Cross Matters for Your Life, By Robert Kolb on May 08, 2017

The theology of the cross gives us a paradigm for witness, friendship, and support in the normal routines and in the emergencies of those around us. The Lord calls us into their lives to embody the Living Presence of his love.

As Paul sketched his theology of the cross, above all in the first two chapters of his first epistle to the Corinthians, we see that this paradigm for Christian realism first of all defines who God is for us. He is not some hidden form, whose plans and counsels we can only dimly sense.
The God hidden behind his own majesty and glory is a god shaped in our own image, as Feuerbach observed. The only God we know is the one whose righteousness-whose right way of being God-is revealed in the sacrificial love of the blood-drenched cross. The only God there is appears to us as the kid in the crib, the criminal on the cross, the corpse in the crypt. The fullness of God was pleased to dwell in the one who reconciles all things to himself by making peace through the blood of his very own cross (Col. 1:19-20).

Second, the paradigm of the cross defines who we are. We are those people who know ourselves only when we come to see that we are sinners, justifiably forsaken by God and utterly vulnerable to death. We see our reflection in the image of a dying incarnate God (Mark 15:34).
Third, the cross shows us the way back to life: through faith-alone! Neither empirical proof nor rational proof will place us in the hands of God; these epistemologies serve well on earth, but they place the object of our search for knowledge under the dominion of our own minds.
God maintains his Lordship over our minds. He speaks his promise of life from the cross. This promise elicits and creates faith. God destroys the wisdom of the wise and thwarts the discernment of the discerning; he saves those who believe, through the proclamation of Christ crucified (1 Cor. 1:18-25).

Fourth, the cruciform paradigm reveals how God restores life: by letting the law pay us the full wages our sinfulness has earned us (Rom. 6:23a), by burying us as sinners in Christs tomb and thereby giving us life again as an absolutely free gift-genuine human life (Rom. 6:4, 23b).

Finally, the theology of the cross presents us with the way in which we live our lives in him. Our resurrected life as Gods new instruments of righteousness is a life which bears crosses for othersfor the sake of Christ (Matt. 16:24).

We evaluate our success neither in terms of how many blessings we experience nor in terms of how much suffering we have endured. Rather, we find satisfaction in serving up the love of Christ to those who are thirsting for love, as God places them in our paths.
