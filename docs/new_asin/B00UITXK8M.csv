7045794,5,B00UITXK8M,I don't understand why so many people laugh at this excellent and hard-hitting documentary about the male fashion industry. Derek Zoolander is a king amongst men (and a fine Mer-Man) and he doesn't deserve this abuse. I challenge you ALL to a walk off!

7045861,5,B00UITXK8M,"The Blu-ray version is picture perfect quality.  The plot revolves around the male modelling and fashion industry and how Derek Zoolander gets sucked-into an assassination plot to murder the prime minister of Malaysia who wants to put an end to all child labor laws in Asia.  This threatens the ready-to-wear fashion houses so they plot to end the prime minister's reign during the rollout of a spring fashion line.  HYSTERICAL!!  The satire, the comedic moments, and the casting are amazing!!  Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell, Jon Voight, Jerry Stiller, FUNNY AND AMAZING CAST with a ""killer"" story line.  If you like unique comedy, this movie is a must-own.",1455235200,4,653,5.05607476635514
7045862,3,B00UITXK8M,"There are some movies that I am undeniably curious about despite the fact that I am fairly certain I won't like it when I watch it.  Zoolander is one of those films.  Im not a big fan of most of the cast, and it just looked ridiculous to me.  And yet, Ive heard so many references to it over the years, I just had to see it.  While its not an outstanding film, I was surprised by my reaction to it.

This film centers on the world of male models and the ridiculously good looking Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller).  Ben has been the top male model for years, but his reign is coming to an end as everyone is getting excited about the latest up and comer, Hansel (Owen Wilson).

And the timing is perfect.  With the spotlight leaving Zoolander, he can be used as a pawn in a conspiracy lead by Mugatu (Will Ferrell) to assassinate the new President of Malaysia, who is insisting workers be paid a fair wage for their work.  The only person at all interested in this conspiracy is reporter Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor).  Will she uncover the truth in time to stop the assassination?

The premise of the film is pretty ridiculous, right?  And yet, its executed well.  It helps that this movie is more comedy with a mystery/conspiracy plot.  The movie got some laughs for me, especially out of the dumb lead models.  It completely plays up the stereotype that models are stupid, but many of those jokes work.

Of course, not all the humor was for me, which isn't a surprise given the cast.  There are plenty of bad jokes that fall flat.  However, I was expecting to cringe a lot more than I was at much of the humor.

And the plot holds together reasonably well.  Oh, its over the top and unrealistic.  However, its a comedy first and foremost, and I wasn't expecting a true thriller from the film.  Given that, the plot still makes sense and unfolds in a logical manner.

I wasn't aware of just how all-star the rest of the cast was until I started to watch.  We get the likes of Jerry Stiller and Jon Voight in the film in addition to the stars Ive already named, although I think my favorite was the one scene role that David Duchovny had.  And I have to mention the many cameos, although the most surreal was Donald Trump, given what is going on in 2016.  Its really no surprise that everyone was perfect in bringing this wacky world to life.

I did watch this film on TV, so Im sure some of the content was cut out.  I still didn't care for the orgy scene; honestly, I found the entire romantic part forced and rushed.  Still, keep in mind that the film is rated PG-13 for a reason.

My reaction to this film is colored by my preconceptions going into it.  I was expecting to hate it, so I was surprised that I actually enjoyed it.  Still, its enough outside my normal tastes that I didn't love it.  Im glad I did finally watch it, however.

Because the film was so over the top and wacky, Im not sure I would rush out to watch it again.  While not the greatest of films, Zoolander wasn't as bad as I feared it would be.",1455148800,2,3024,4.292035398230088
7045863,5,B00UITXK8M,"Some people may not understand why this movie is so funny because it is so stupid. That's the reason.  This fashion model of Dumb and Dumber plays on the assumption that models are all looks and no brains, and in this case that's correct. Top model Zoolander gets outed in his 5th awarding of ""Male Model of the Year"" by rival Hansel, ""retires"" from modelling and is immediately drawn into an assassination plot by all the courtouriers of the world who want to kill the prime minister of a country trying to make reforms which will cost them a fortune in the cheap labor department.

It's silly, fun, and not supposed to be anything but...with cameos and surprise appearances. Not great art or even fantastic dramatic acting  but simply something to make us laugh with its absurdities.

Watch, laugh, and enjoy.

This novel was viewed as a theatrical film and recently seen on DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1455062400,4,944,4.696969696969697
7045864,1,B00UITXK8M,"First off, I love Zoolander. Now that we've got that clear, this release is not what was advertised. Yes, they added a couple of new features (not as wonderful as you might think) and a preview of the sequel (can't wait for that), both things that were advertised. However, the promised UV copy (listed at the time of pre-order here and at Paramount) is not included. Mention of it has been removed from this listing (after I and many others pre-ordered) and no replacement procedure has been announced. Additionally, the compression issues of the first release in 2014 have not been corrected as this is the same transfer used for that release. I marked this down two stars for the compression artifacts they could easily have fixed by using a 50 GB Blu-ray (this is a 25 GB which is the same kind Mill Creek uses) and two more for the bait and switch. If a company announces a release with a UV copy, it should have one, that's just good business.",1454371200,22,949,4.523255813953488

7045866,5,B00UITXK8M,One of my all time favorite movies that was never released on Blu Ray...until now. It seems likely it was released as a marketing tool to promote the upcoming sequel. But I was happy to add it to my collection nonetheless. I think this movie is hilarious and quite underrated. I think this is one of Ben Stiller's funniest characters. Lots of laughs. I recommend it. Better late than never on the Blu Ray release. Now if they would just release Starsky & Hutch on Blu Ray...,1454371200,3,474,4.459770114942529
