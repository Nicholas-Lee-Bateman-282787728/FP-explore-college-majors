749519,2,6303985491,"Stepping out of his father's shadow, Lon Chaney Jr. found initial fame and acclaim in 1940's films, 'Of Mice and Men' and 'One Million Years BC'. As a result, he was swiftly catapulted into Universal's top drawer, playing most  of their classic monsters of the time. Only as the poor, tortured Larry  Talbot (aka The Wolf Man) did Chaney ever find true success, and in the  mid-forties, his time as top-billed status was over. Then came many film  roles like this. In the thankless and mostly mute part of 'The Butcher',  Chaney is brought back from the dead with 'terrifying' power. He then kills  those responsible for his demise. And that's the plot. Of course, he is  destroyed at the end, after being horribly scarred by an attack by a  flame-thrower. But the film is stagey, with no real commitment. The  supporting players don't really seem to have their hearts in it, and  matters aren't helped by the 'Dragnet'-style narration that explain several  less-than-vital-scenes. For Chaney, there was worse to come, but even this  film is for completists only.",947894400,2,1063,4.877094972067039

749634,4,6303985491,"Charles Butcher Benton (Lon Chaney Jr.) is executed for crimes he committed.  But!  He was not alone in this and swears REVENGE against the double crossing stinkers who ratted him out.  Foremost on his hit list is a slimy shyster who gloats in Butcher's face before he's gassed.  ""So long dead man.""  Unbeknownst to all and sundry, the Butcher's body is sold to a slightly mad scientist (Robert Shayne) who experiments on him with his faithful assistant (Joe Flynn).  With a super secret injection and tons of electricity, the Butcher springs to life mute, miffed, and mean.  He promptly kills the two nitwits who saved him and heads off on a killing spree, anxious to murder the bums who got him arrested.  And then there's the matter of the $600,000 he stole and hid.  Not to mention the secret map to the stash that he gave a stripper for safe keeping................

This is quite fun, even though it plays out like a sci-fi version of Dragnet.  Poor Chaney has almost no dialog.  Instead, they keep showing the same extreme close-up of his eyes all mean and tremulous.  The exact same crazy eye close-ups.

Rail-roaded through the system, imprisoned & sentenced to death, Bensen vows to kill the three finks... even if he has to do it from beyond the grave! Luckily for the Butcher, immediately following his execution his body is purchased by an unscrupulous scientist's assistant, for the purpose of conducting unconventional experiments involving cellular regeneration. Robert Shayne (Inspector Henderson from the 1950's ""Superman"" TV show), and an uncredited Joe Flynn (Captain Binghamton from ""McHale's Navy""), work their medical hocus-pocus on the Butcher's fresh corpse, and before you can say ""Leapin' Lazurus!"" the Big Guy is lumbering back to life, (understandably NOT in the best of moods), and immediately begins hunting down his former partners. Casey Adams (aka Max Showalter, who played Grandpa Fred in John Hughes' ""Sixteen Candles""), is police Lt. Dick Chasen (good lord, was that name intentional?), a by-the-book cop who is determined to get his man, er... corpse, er... whatever, at any cost. He also provides voice-over narration, like many great old 1940's gumshoe flicks, to keep us from getting too confused,.

THOUGHTS: Let's be honest. This is an undeniably silly movie, but there's just something about it. It has a zany charm that I felt the very first time I watched it. This new ""Widescreen Edition"" is the 2nd or 3rd version of this film I've owned. That's how much I like it. It is goofy as all get out, but has real heart. It takes itself seriously but is too off-kilter to be enjoyed as a serious film from either a sci-fi perspective or as a crime drama. But... as a whacked out mishmash of both genres, it succeeds with flying colors!

THE DVD: This release from Bayview Entertainment/Widowmaker touts it as being a hi-def transfer in its proper widescreen format. The presentation here is certainly much cleaner looking than any of the other grainy, muffled-sounding, splice-ladden, washed out Public Domain releases that I've endured over the years. No, it's not a frame-by-frame Hi-Def restoration like Ben-Hur or Gone With The Wind, but it looks pretty dang good. I don't pretend to know all the history behind this low budget quickie, so I cannot say for sure whether or not this widescreen presentation is the proper aspect ratio. The picture fills my HDTV screen and the print quality looks quite nice. If you pick up a used copy thru Amazon then it's an even better bargain. 5 STARS for this goofy yet charming Lon Chaney Jr. sci-fi/crime noir/horror time-waster. It's perfect fare for late night viewing or any day when the weather's crummy.",1388966400,3,2773,5.026086956521739

749707,3,6303985491,"... is the best way I can describe the flavor of this film, which is not nearly as bad as its current low rating would have you believe. In fact, if you like 50's and 60's Allied Artist horror on the cheap, I think you'll like this one. Remember Allied Artists was a poverty row outfit, and they could usually afford just one star. In this case it is Lon Chaney Jr. as armed robber Charles Benton, betrayed by two other bank robbers who turned state's evidence at the request of sleazy lawyer Paul Lowe, who wants a fall guy for the robbery and a chance at a smaller split for the 600K payroll heist for which he hired the three thieves in the first place. Benton realizes all of this, and the last thing he says before he is executed is that he is going to get the three who betrayed him.

Now the lawyer isn't nervous at all, but the two other robbers think maybe Benton took some of the money - which at the time of his death only he knew the location - and hired a hit man for them. What they are definitely not expecting is for a couple of scientists to pay off the morgue attendant at the prison to hand over Benton's body. The pair are experimenting with electricity as a cure for cancer and need a fresh human body for their next test. Well ""It's Alive!"" turns out to be instantaneous tragedy for this pair instead of temporary triumph as in the case of Victor Frankenstein. Benton is unexpectedly brought back to life with a molecular structure that can't be penetrated by any substance, vocal chords burned out so he can't speak, superhuman strength, and with a desire to pick up where he left off and kill the three guys who betrayed him. I'll let you watch and see how this all pans out.

The Dragnet comparison comes from the voice over of police Lt. Dick Chasen who is narrating the whole story. With Allied Artist horror you really don't expect much in the way of great acting or good art design, but more could have been done for the continuity and even the dialogue. For instance after Benton returns to life the narrator calls him a ""Monster Made Man"". Huh? What monster made him? I believe he meant to say ""Man Made Monster"". The narrator talks about how Benton wants to save killing crooked lawyer Paul for last, but then later after he kills the first of his fellow robbers he goes looking for the lawyer. In the jail house conversation Paul was trying to get the location of the hidden loot out of Benton who refuses to tell, but later Paul has somehow figured out how to get the loot but just can't open the strongbox it is in. Benton is established as a character who just wants to kill the three who betrayed him, yet mid-film he shows up in the middle of some suburb attacking and killing random people. Usually the best horror establishes the ""monster"" as someone for whom you have some sympathy and thus ambivalent feelings. Here Benton is pretty much just a mute killing machine after he is revived.

I'd recommend this one, just realize you are dealing with an outfit that didn't have much in the way of funding to begin with and try to meet it half-way.",1369440000,2,3084,4.369337979094077
749708,4,6303985491,"Just watched my copy of Retromedia's remaster of Indestructible Man yesterday and directly compared it to both the Roan and previous Retromedia (Lon Chaney Collection) releases. With all due respect to the previous reviewer, the new transfer blows them both away in terms of sharpness/detail, contrast/brightness, and framing (matted at 1.66:1 anamorphic). There is still the usual minor speckling and blemishing, but this is far and away the best this movie has ever looked on home video, and obsoletes all previous DVD versions. A major upgrade from the Roan and Chaney Collection releases, with much-improved black/white levels and richer grayscale, and the definitive home video edition as of this date.

Does it look like a fully restored, major studio release? Of course not. And if Warner still has materials on this in their vaults and someday releases an official 1.85:1 widescreen, remastered DVD (two big ifs), will it look better than this? Most likely, yes. But, for now, if you want the crispest, best-looking version of Indestructible Man out there, this is it.

Note: The Retromedia DVD is listed on Amazon as the Bayview Entertainment/Widowmaker release, and has the words ""Widescreen High Definition Film Transfer"" at the top of the front cover and green-tinted likeness of Chaney.",1367798400,14,1299,5.270531400966184

749710,2,6303985491,"Somebody at amazon decided to lump all the reviews into one bundle, so most of these reviews appear to be about the version that the MST3K TV show used.  The problem with MST3K is, although the comments may be funny, you don't get the full effect because you are watching someone else's opinion of what the better of funnier parts are.

This is a review of the uncut movie (and also the t-shirt) that comes in the package advertised as DVDTee.

First the movie:  It's a gas, even without the comments from the MST3K peanut gallery.  Oh, how Chaney had fallen by this time.  He apparently was looking for anything to pay the bills by the time this movie came out.  With the exception of a brief setup in the beginning to explain why his character will be doing what he does later, Chaney has no dialogue.  He is reduced to grunts and lumbering undeterred after his goal.

Briefly, ""Butcher"" Benton (Chaney) is scheduled to die in the electric chair for a robbery/murder by him and several accomplices.  Benton feels he has been double-crossed and swears revenge.  But he is successfully executed so it seems those words are hollow.  But a mad scientist arranges to have the body after it is executed, and through some electrical hoohah and scientific fiddle faddle, the scientist unintentionally brings Benton back to life.

Yeah, it's a variation of Frankenstein, with the added story line of the ""Frankenstein monster"" going a killing rampage out of revenge.  The most laughable part is the over the action dialogue by the police officer giving us the story as in flashback.  The guy sounds as stilted as anything that Jack ""Sgt Friday"" Webb ever did on his TV show ""Dragnet"".

The movie gets two stars because at least I didn't turn it off.  There is an added bonus of a T-shirt.  Like the rest of the t-shirts  in this DVDtee series, you get a vintage poster of the movie printed on a tee.  That's worth the price of admission if you ask me.",1363305600,,1944,4.59593023255814

749773,2,6303985491,"Not a badly made film, but very unengaging to say the least.  Chaney opens up the film with a nice and fairly extensive dialouge exchange vowing revenge on those who sent him up the river giving promise to another film in alignment with his more sucessful Man Made Monster.

From that point on it was clear this was a paint by numbers job that only uses Chaney in what might be called an 'extensive cameo' role.  A haggerty Chaney lumbers his way thru the film, no line of dialouge save for the opening exchange, doing his monster on the rampage thing.  I never really bought the 'he was too drunk to remember his lines so they wrote him as a mute in all his films' theory, especially considering the fantastic job he does on the opening dialouge exchange here, but the remainder of this film makes me think there may have been some inkling of truth to it. or maybe there just wasn't enough of a paycheck in it to make alot of work remembering lines worth his while.

There are other members of the cast with much more dialouge and screen time than Chaney and when Chaney is not onscreen, you may easily mistake this flick for a Z grade cop thriller fro mthe 50's.

Overall, I'd say skip this one unless you're a Lon Chaney jr completeist.  For a good lesser known Chaney monster film, see Man Made Monster.  For a hammy later years B effort from a haggerty and weather beaten Lon Chaney jr, see The Alligator People or The Cyclops first.",1166745600,,1438,4.4

749775,3,6303985491,"Sometimes an independent film company succeeds in a film despite its normal handicap of a shoestring budget.  In the case of THE INDESTRUCTIBLE MAN director Jack Pollexfen uses the eye twitching talents of Lon Chaney Jr to create a weird period piece that both harkens back to the early career of Chaney who used to thrive on such off beaten roles and looks forward to the modern day Terminator series that features Arnold Schwarzenegger in a similar role as the bullet proof protagonist.  Added to this was Pollexfen's use of a Dragnet-style narrator using co-star Max Showalter, who as Detective Dick Chasen, sounds remarkably like Jack Webb as Sgt Joe Friday.  Usually, the graininess of a cheapo like this one works against the viewer's getting involved in the action, but in this case, Chaney's twitching eyes (whenever he gets angry--in nearly every third scene) become a symbol of an uprooted emotion of anger that is dramatically emphasized by numerous scenes of Chaney simply walking the streets,looking for his former cohorts in crime who betrayed him for $600,000.  Chaney is 'Butcher' Benton, a career criminal who unwisely links up with a sleazy lawyer and two other lowlifes to steal money.  They offer Benton to the police.  But before Benton is executed, he vows revenge.  Up to this point, this is a straight crime drama.  Director Pollexfen quickly switches gears to the realm of science fiction by having Butcher's corpse wind up in the hands of two of television's most widely known second bananas, Robert Shayne (from Superman's Inspector Henderson), who plays mad scientist Professor Bradshaw and Joe Flynn (from McHale's Navy Captain Binghampton), as his geeky assistant.  This pair revives Butcher by zapping him with 270,000 volts of electricity.  An unexpected benefit is that all that juice has made his skin bullet proof and rendered him mute.  For most of the picture, Benton prowls the streets of Los Angeles, looking like any other disheveled ex-con, and killing those who betrayed him.
It is too easy to dismiss THE INDESTRUCTIBLE MAN as just yet another example of a last attempt of an out-of-style actor to grab one more paycheck.  Chaney rarely was allowed to speak at length in any of his films, but when he was as in HIGH NOON or OF MICE AND MEN, Chaney possessed the ability to make you feel his pain that he guarded under his massive frame.  Here, there are only verbal hints of his inner turmoil.  He tries to convey his anger, and in a few scenes he succeeds.  When he meets with his former girlfiend, Eva (Marian Carr), his muteness does not allow him to verbalize.  He takes a sharp scissors and blunts the tip against his open palm, with the camera focusing more on his face than his hand, and the audience can see that the Butcher is silently announcing his intentions of revenge.  There are enough scenes like this one to elevate THE INDESTRUCTIBLE MAN from the sewers of culluoid bottom feeding to the next higher level where viewers can overlook its obvious shortcomings and be reminded once again that wilted talent can still stand out in a world of dreck.",1069545600,,3105,4.850378787878788
749776,4,6303985491,"This film really isn't so bad if you consider a few things. An encouraged guy named Jack Pollexfen (not unlike Ed Wood) had an idea (not unlike Ed Wood) and cast a great actor from the past (not unlike Ed Wood). The difference is that this is a take on ""noir"", though without the finesse of those earlier films (sorta like Ed Wood). Production values, as in any independent film with a somewhat believable plot, are low. (""Blair Witch Project"", though innovative, was not much different). My idea is not to criticize it for its tackiness, but for its idea. The acting isn't that bad.  Marian Carr is actually quite effective as the only female lead. Casey Adams was good as he could be; made a big mark on TV in ""Green Acres""; it's almost a take on ""Dragnet"", the hit TV series at the time (though Adams has more life than Jack Webb ever did...). Then there's Lon Chaney, Jr., relegated to idiotic roles because Hollywood never knew what to do with him; with the studio collapse of the early 50's, no one remembered his touching performance as ""The Wolf Man"" (1941) or his most remarkable performance (as Lenny) in ""Of Mice and Men"" (1939, directed by Lewis Milestone). Whaddya do with a guy like this? Perhaps he knew that he was ""hard to cast"", but I beg anyone to say that his heart wasn't in it. Today's wave of independent film is suddenly recognized as a force to be reckoned with; budgets as they are, I think some of the ""lousy"" films of the 50's tried to do the same thing. They didn't have Miramax to back them...NO ONE, for that matter. Still, I was a part of the Drive-In crowd back then, and I still appreciate this kind of film fare. Even bad independent film should be respected, to a point. The really trashy films will be just that; small moments of ingenuity should be respected. I have the VHS version, and now the DVD. Both are of low quality, but I find both equally entertaining. This film has been written off as junk by the studios who've produced it. Despite the bad VHS/DVD transfers, the film held my interest.

749778,3,6303985491,"Hollywood just couldn't get enough of clumsy, oafish, neo-Frankenstein monsters in the 1950s, as this movie demonstrates quite well. Lon Chaney, Jr., looking like a cross between Babe Ruth and Walter Matthau, plays Charles ""Butcher"" Benton, a death row inmate who swears revenge on his partners in crime for turning states' evidence and helping earn him a date with the gas chamber. I'm not sure why they call him the Butcher, though; as far as we are told, all he did was help hold up an armored car, steal 600 grand, and hide it where no one, especially his partners, would ever find it - looking back, the whole hiding all the money thing may have a lot to do with his partners' selling him out to the cops, but you just try explaining that to Butcher yourself. One must assume he killed someone during the heist - either that, or he was a meat butcher before he turned to a life of crime. He swears he will kill the guys who ratted him out, a threat that his three former partners scoff at for the logical reason that the Butcher is a day away from being executed. What they don't know is that the Butcher has a plan; in a brilliant move, he allows himself to be killed, fully confident that, against all the odds in the world, some crazy doctor will bribe some morgue attendant into selling him his corpse, at which point the doctor will, in looking for a cure for cancer, accidentally bring the Butcher back to life with several hundred thousand volts of electricity and give him superhuman strength and a skin that even Ginzu knives cannot penetrate. This is exactly what happens. (Actually, the Butcher doesn't really make any plans to back up his seemingly hollow threats at all; he just gets lucky.)
Granted a second lease on life, missing only the ability to speak due to the debilitating effect massive volts of electricity have on the human vocal cords, he decides it's about time to start earning that nickname he loves so dearly. While all of this is happening, a bland police detective named Dick Chasen (played rather woodenly by Max Showalter) remains committed to finding the stolen money and implicating the three spineless hoods who helped Butcher carry out the heist, although it is entirely possible that he is just using this as an excuse for him to begin putting the moves on the Butcher's old burlesque dancer girlfriend. Eventually, all of these characters and plot points come together for as satisfying an end as you might expect (this is a criticism, not a note of praise), but in the meantime Lon Chaney Jr. stumbles around like a drunk man with one wooden leg, occasionally scrunching his face up into what is supposed to be a fierce expression as the camera zooms in for a close-up. As far as urban Frankenstein-esque movies go, Indestructible Man isn't that bad; the decision to have Chaney utter no lines whatsoever after his execution and resurrection seems like a wise move, but then you think about how many additional lines this threw Max Showalter's way. Realizing you can't win either way, you immediately begin to forget everything about this rather dull sort-of-monster movie.",1054684800,2,3119,4.703839122486289

Chasen hangs around the burley-Q house, questioning one of the strippers, Eva.  He thinks she may have a clue to the still missing money.  He wants to pump her, but only for information.  Yeah, right.  Hot on the tail (oops! trail, I mean) Chasen invites Eva out for dinner.  In a Freudian moment, Eva tells Chasen, ""I don't even know your first name.""  Chasen slowly replies, ""It's...Dick.""  Butcher searches the seamy side of town for his victims.  The floppy dummies that he throws around are great examples of cheesy special effects.  The rest of the cast is as obscure as the dreary B&W photography.  Only the names were changed to protect the innocent.  Check out the old Rambler police cars.  This '50s hybrid of crime thriller and horror flick is entertaining low budget nonsense.  Have fun. ;-)",1030406400,,1666,5.126865671641791
749780,3,6303985491,"In the 1950s, there were tons of sci-fi/horror films. A few of them were outstanding (The Day the Earth Stood Still, Creature From the Black Lagoon), and some stinkers (Plan 9 From Outer Space, Bride of the Monster), but the majority of them were solid, middle-of-the-road flicks. Indestructible Man falls in this category.
The film was no challenge for Chaney from an acting standpoint. He only had a few lines at the start of the film before he was rendered mute after being brought back to life in an experiment. However, he did come through by some of his facial expressions that told the viewer what he was thinking. For instance, he arrives at the office of one of his victims to find it empty. He appears frustrated, but then, he hears the elevator coming, and a satisfied smirk comes over his face.
The film was definitely low budget, and Chaney was probably doing it for a payday, but it does have some good moments. The scenes in the Los Angeles sewer were suspenseful, and in some of the killings, Chaney's body language and his brutality lived up to his character's nickname of ""The Butcher.""
It is a shame that Chaney enjoyed true stardom for only a few years with Universal in the 1940s as he played nearly every movie monster they had. He was then cast aside in character roles and movies such as this. He was a much better actor, and his talents were wasted. But, like a true professional, he took his medicine and continued to work hard, making several movies throughout his career.
Indestructible Man is not for every one, but if you are a Chaney fan and love these types of movies from the 1950s, then it is a worthy addition to your collection.",978912000,2,1664,4.568561872909699

It begins at the Los Angeles Hall of Justice. Detective Lt. R. Chasen tells about this case. Butcher Benton was convicted on the word of his accomplices, he refused to share the $600,000 loot with them. Im going to get you. He won't tell where the stolen money is hidden. Lt. Chasen will continue to investigate even though this case is closed. Eva Martin is a professional dancer, she didn't know. Paul Lowe opens that letter to find a map. Dr. Bradshaw wanted a human body for experimentation, and gets one. An electrical jolt is applied, will it work? Drugs are used too. Benton attacks the men who brought him back to life. [No good deed ever goes unpunished.] Lt. Chasen tells about his past. He wants to find that $600,000 loot and convict Bentons accomplices.

Eva tells about her past, she won a beauty contest and came to Los Angeles. Chasen watched Marcelli and Lowe. Marcelli is unemployed and takes a job offer (no one wants a squealer). Benton walks to Los Angeles, then finds a car with a flat tire. This is repaired, Benton drives away with it. One patrol car finds him but can do nothing! The whole force is on the job. Benton visits Eva and learns about the letter. Then she calls Chasen. Eva warns Sweeney, but he doesnt believe her. Fingerprints on the stolen car identify the killer! Eva rides the railway. [Bunker Hill?] Paul Lowe is ordered out of a bar after he asks for help. Will he be safe at his office? Will his pistol save his life? Then Eva learns about another murder.

The police learn more about Benton. Can the police find and stop him? Can a flame-thrower stop him? Benton finds the hidden cash. [It looks fresh after being stored in a damp environment.] The police shoot a bazooka rocket at Benton, it does little! They find the money. The flame thrower is used, to no avail! Benton escapes through a hatch in the sewer. There is an electrical power substation. Danger High Voltage is the warning sign. Benton climbs a ladder to escape. There is a great electrical flash, and Benton is stopped. The money was recovered, case closed. Chasen gets 48 hours off. Eva is happy its over. There is a change in her plans. [Will it work out?]

This is an interesting adaptation of the Frankenstein horror story for modern times. It shows Los Angeles as it existed in the early 1950's. Note the few automobiles on the streets then. The final scenes recall He Walked By Night. It is a good movie but not a great one (like a TV movie). Were there similarities to The Asphalt Jungle? This movie did not have a big budget. Lon Chaney Jr. played in many movies since The Wolf Man.",1477180800,,2632,4.523109243697479
