3700472,5,B001MT7ZJM,"Goosebumps scores another winner with this Trilogy of stories! The first 2 are tributes to all those Universal Mummy Monsters from the 1930's/1940's. The 3rd is a kooky different kind of tale involving Mud Monsters! Of course, the girl tells all she can't be scared...very recommended!",1411084800,,285,5.217391304347826

3700476,4,B001MT7ZJM,"Here are three more Goosebumps tales to watch around Halloween.

In Return of the Mummy, young Gabe is visiting his uncle in Egypt, where they find the tomb of a great prince, but there is a curse on the tomb. Mummies come alive to stop them from opening the tomb.

Don't Wake Mummy has Jeff Carter receiving a gift from his archaeologist father - a 4,000 year-old-mummy!

Eddie and Hat are going to scare a friend of theirs at Mud Creek, but there is a Mud Monster waiting for them.

The latter is my favorite of the three episodes. Each episode is G rated with no blood or gore, so it is safe for the entire family to watch it.",1345939200,,629,4.216666666666667
3700477,4,B001MT7ZJM,"The ""Goosebumps"" collection of DVDs have been big hits with my 3 children, and ""Return of the Mummy"" contains 3 scary episodes.

In episode 1, Gabe visits his uncle and cousin in Egypt.  Gabe's uncle has been working on an archaeological dig and has uncovered the tomb of a mummified prince.  But, the mummy doesn't like being disturbed and he's soon chasing after Gabe and his family.

In episode 2, Jeff Carter's dad has sent a sarcophagus to their home.  Plus, Jeff's sister Kim has a nasty habit of scaring him.  Soon, Kim and her friend have Jeff believing that the mummy in their basement will come to life and catch them.  Unfortunately for Jeff and Kim, the mummy DOES come to life!

In the final episode, Eddie and his friend Hat are frustrated because a know-it-all girl in their class is showing them up.  They decide to lure her to Muddy Creek and into the waiting arms of the Mud Monsters.  But who will end up getting caught?

The Goosebumps series are fun, scary short episodes aimed at children.  They are scary, but usually not enough so as to really frighten the viewer.  My whole family really enjoys this series.  If you want some good, clean scary movies to watch, then check out ""Return of the Mummy"" and others from the Goosebumps collection.",1256515200,7,1265,4.589285714285714

8321812,4,B001MT7ZJM,"A great collection of classics. I was born in 1990 & i grew up watching this. So for nostalgia i grab 1 or 2 of these dvds a year,around Halloween. These are about as oldschool as it gets,there all Mummy episodes & i think You Can't Scare Me is on here too. I have not seen this since i bought it. If you are a fan & grew up or you have kids get this for them. R.L. Stine is like a mild version of Stephen King. Go get it.",1458345600,,422,3.7
