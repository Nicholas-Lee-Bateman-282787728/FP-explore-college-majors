Probably borrowed by another child and not  returned......However, I am desperately searching for it again, this time  for a wonderful little boy named Christopher who celebrates his fourth  birthday this week.  I hope you can find a copy somewhere.  It comes highly  recommended by me and every child I have watched it with.  A delight!",963792000,,501,4.9397590361445785
330141,5,6301431367,"I've been checking this site periodically for a long time...just hoping it  will be re-released.  Our first Lyle video has worn out, because we have  watched it so much! It's so wonderful to see a classic author and his  character celebrated.",959644800,,242,4.829268292682927

7811697,5,6301431367,"My sister and I used to watch this movie among all others when we were little.  Not only did we love the Lyle Lyle Crocodile books, but when a friend of the family sent us a homemade copy on VHS of this animated version of The House on East 88th St, it quickly became a new favorite.  Fortunately, I still have that tape in my attic, but my VCR has been in the landfill for years, since it's kaput.  I want it not only for myself, but I have a friend who just had a kid, and they too will need a copy of this first-rate cartoon musical.  PLEASE BRING IT BACK!",1261353600,,559,3.9642857142857144
7811698,5,6301431367,"When I was little, my mother recorded this off of HBO, and it was one of our favorite videos. Of course, in the shuffle of moving from place to place, this recording was lost. A few years ago, I managed to miraculously procure a copy of it on VHS for her birthday--she was so thrilled! This video should definitely find its way into distribution again, as it is incredibly touching even to this day. The book is fantastic, but the songs in this production should really be shared with newer generations. They still stand on their own after all these years.",1260921600,,556,4.514851485148514

7811701,5,6301431367,"The Lyle story has given us much to sing about...from the local library. We want to have Lyle in our ome as well, as I am sure any youngster (and  any adult who appreciates a good musical!) will also! Please bring back  Lyle's adventure on East 88th St. back to VHS!",968198400,,266,4.196078431372549
