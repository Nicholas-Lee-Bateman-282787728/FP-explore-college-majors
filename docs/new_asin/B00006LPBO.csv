1785306,1,B00006LPBO,"Oh man, I was looking forward to this DVD. I'm a HUGE DMB fan. I love ""Listener Supported"" because it gives you a feeling of being in the audience. But because of HORRIBLE editing, Folsom Field gives you the feeling of being in a blender. Absolutely terrible editing. Could not be more disappointed with this.",1037836800,,309,4.636363636363637
1785307,4,B00006LPBO,"I was anxiously awaiting this DVD when I read the first review posted here.  I was concerned about the rapid-fire editing and looked for it when I first viewed the DVD.  Of course since that was what I was looking for, that is what I found.  The music is great but I found the editing to be just too darn quick.  However, as the show went on, I noticed that with darkness came fewer crowd shots and slower editing.  I have also found that it kinda grows on you with each viewing.
I agree that comparing this show to Listener Supported is like comparing apples to oranges.  ""LS"" is a much more intimate show which is great.  But the Fulsom show, with the big screens and crowd shots, makes me feel like I'm back at the 2 shows I saw on that tour.  And that is a great thing.  I loved seeing them live and Fulsom puts me right back there in the crowd screaming my head off at the first few cords of Two Step and Watchtower.  So basically, if you want to feel like you have DMB playing just for you and 5 of your closest friends, buy Listener Supported.  If you what to relive your actual concert experience, Fulsom is the one for you.
In my mind, anyone who even remotely likes DMB should buy Fulsom AND ""LS"", even before buying any CD's.  I have found the DMB DVD's to be the best around as they take advantage of 5.1 technology to give you a great live feel.
Final comment: Buy Listener Supported first, then buy Fulsom ASAP.",1037318400,3,1425,4.217712177121771
1785308,3,B00006LPBO,"I am an avid Dave Matthews Band customer.  I have everything they have produced.  I can listen to any of their CDs and know almost every single word to every song.  Being so, I was not afraid to buy both the CD and DVD.  This has been the first dissapointment with Dave Matthews.
On the package, it states with pride that it took 22 cameras to film this event.  That sounded good, but after watching the FIRST song, I knew that this was a problem, more than a blessing.
It is as if the editor was afraid to not let a single shot be left behind.  The average shot probably lasts for about two seconds.  There is no way to connect to the band.  Face is, DMB always plays big venues, and unless you have really good seats, it can be hard to feel cnnected.  This was always the blessing of a video of a live preformance.  This chance we have is taken away from us.
Maybe next time they'll figure out a multitude of cameras can be helpful, if you don't feel obligated to show every single one of them all the time.
This is not to say the music is great.  The music IS great.  Its too bad the video actually distracts you from listening to it.  So just go ahead and buy the CD, and you will be pleased.  This product, however, deserves to be forgotten.",1037232000,23,1246,4.158995815899582
1785309,4,B00006LPBO,"When I bought this DVD I expected it to be a lot like Listener Supported's DVD.  The concert is taped as a whole, but when I bought this one, I  was really disaapointed.  Don't get me wrong the music is wonderful, fantastic (I'll have a review of the album soon, if you care to read that) but the DVD plays with the footage, it jumps around, cuts, flashes, it's pretty stupid.  Dave should have stuck with what he did with ""Listener Supported"" because, in my opinion, that is the greatest DVD ever made (just cuase I'm a hardcore Dave fan).  Still, it's worth seeing once or twice (or owning if you're a hardcore Dave fan) becuase the music is good and it's cool to see the intensity of their performance.  It needs some cleaning up.",1037059200,,733,4.392592592592592
1785310,2,B00006LPBO,"I think people buy concert DVD's so they can watch the band play. This seems obvious to everyone except to the people who produced the DVD of the Folsom Field concert.

This DVD is seriously undermined by unnecessary cuts to the audience.  Some malformed edits occur at completely inappropriate times.  For example, during Bartender, the band builds up the passion and intensity of what is essentially a prayer to God for salvation from drinking.  As Dave opens his soul to God and the audience, the shot cuts to a couple girls pointing at the stage in what is supposed to be an expression of awe. Instead, it is a shot that dishonors the significance of the moment and turns Dave's soul into a pop spectacle.

At other times, the edits do not cut to individual musicians as they play notable phrases in a song. So, instead of watching Carter lay down a great fill, you see a cute young girl apparently quite excited by the experience if you take the bumps in her blouse as any evidence.  Do you want to see just how Steffan plays that tasty bass line?  Too bad.  Instead, you'll get to watch fans bounce a beach ball across the crowd.

One reviewer counted some 200+ edit cuts in a single song.  I haven't validated this but it is certainly possible.  There is hardly any continuity or rhythm to the visual experience of this DVD.  The camera angles seem somewhat crippled in comparison to the excellent camera work of Listener Supported.

Folsom Field's DVD is simply a bad video experience.  One reviewer suggested just turning on the DVD and then going about your house to listen to the music.  Good point but I think that's what CDs are for.  Rent this one before you buy it.",1036972800,4,1680,4.55
1785311,3,B00006LPBO,"there's just too much editing and cuts to differing camera angles.  If you enjoyed the intimacy of the Listener Supported DVD, you will probably be a little disappointed in this DVD.  Take this with a grain of salt b/c I'm one of those people that enjoys seeing the band most of the time and feeling the intimacy involved with that.  The cuts from Dave TO the other band members TO the crowd TO a distant shot TO a gimmick shot of a three way split screen is just too much for me.
I loved Listener Supported and would love to be able to give this DVD a higher rating, but just can't.  It seemed to me that Listener Supported perfectly balanced shots of all the differing band members with a few shots of the crowd at proper times.  This just seems scattered (sorry, best word I could think of).  It's great to hear some of the songs for the first time live and it's great just because it's a live DMB show, but the editing and gimmicky production are bothersome.  I'm surprised DMB let it be this overproduced b/c what I love about their shows is that they are what they are--a great live show about great music with little show business and a lot of spirit, heart, and sincerity.
The music is great as always and deserves 5 stars, but to be honest it's hard for me to even give 3 stars overall b/c of the production.  I'm a die-hard DMB fan, but am disappointed with this DVD.  It may still be worth your purchase, but you may want to view a friend's once before dropping the bucks.",1036540800,44,1483,4.28673835125448
1785312,2,B00006LPBO,"Is this an experimental camera work video?? ...way too many different camera shots, zoom-ins, zoom-outs, etc. Rarely does a camera stay on a single shot for more than 3 seconds. I counted 229 different shot changes in one song alone. It's a shame because the music is great. I have no desire to watch this dvd again...unless my eyes are closed.... 5 stars for the music...no stars for the video.",1036454400,6,395,4.6571428571428575
1785313,4,B00006LPBO,"I agree with the first reviewer. I think the video editor tried to approach the editing with a music video type of style. The camera kept changing rather abruptly from one band member to another then to the audience. I don't mind the camera changes, but to do it constantly within short periods of time is quite distracting for a live performance. Also, the visual effects (the 'tri-window-thingy' and the 'audio/visual sync' in the climax of jamming session) really turned me off. Jump near the end of Two Steps and you'll see what I mean.
In a live performance, I would like to see the performer's facial and body expression especially during the jam sessions. Unfortunately this DVD doesn't really allow you to do that. It Should've been approached with 'Listener Supported' style.
Aside from that, the music is excellent. DMB is in its finest when performing live, so this DVD is still a must for DMB fans.",1036454400,6,910,4.765822784810126
1785338,4,B00006LPBO,"While scanning a garage sale I found this and was excided. This is a concert that IMO starts slow but just gets better and better. Along with all my favorites is Angel. I really like that performance. My copy was in like new condition and when I ask the lady how much she said fifty cents,what a score. I enjoyed this concert,would have loved to have been there.",1340323200,,362,4.338235294117647
1785339,4,B00006LPBO,"With so many reviewers complaining about the video production and quality on this DVD, I was a little worried.

There was no need to be.

It is a very entertaining DVD, which captures the spirit of the concert really well. A great selection of songs, including my old favourites like ""The space between"" and ""Two Step"". The addition of some very talented background vocalists added not just variety, but depth at key places, without being intrusive.

Much has been said of the video editing; its not to everyone's taste apparently. What is clear is that the intent was not to simply record the concert as if it was a live-TV show, but give the viewer some idea of the energy and atmosphere at the concert. To me, the occasional scenes of the crowd did not detract at all from the experience. The switching between band members wasn't annoying either, ample time was spent on each and we got to see each one doing their magic.

The only reason I didn't give this a perfect five stars is the crowd noise - sometimes it was allowed to over-power the band at inappropriate times when it should have been isolated and quietened down a bit.",1300147200,2,1134,4.571428571428571
1785340,5,B00006LPBO,"I just love this cd, Dave matthews band just rocks and even more live i recommend this album to anyone",1286668800,,102,4.15
1785341,3,B00006LPBO,"The supposed editing issues didn't bother me at all, the only aspect of this otherwise excellent DVD that REALLY annoys me is the fact that about half-way through, the visuals start to drag behind the sound. (Has anyone else noticed this?)

One of the best things about DMB I beleive, is Carter Beauford. I play the drums also and totally respect that mans playing; it's incredible, so I was watching him closely to figure out how the heck he gets his sounds but as I have said, half way through, he was hitting drums but the sound wasn't in time with the visuals. Now most people are probably thinking ""what? who cares?, the editing is terrible etc etc"". Any drummer out there who has watched Carter play in this DVD would be dissapointed as well, I am sure.

Now, I am no producer but one would think that getting the sound and the pictures of a live rock show to match up would be high on the priority list. Obviously not in this case....

I end up just listening to the 2nd half of the show. I felt that all the songs rocked, especially the songs off ""Everyday"". The only dissapointment was ""Ants Marching"" which started off well then it seemed as if everyone got a bit tired and it sort of fell over.

I am surprised that DMB gave this DVD the ""green light"" in-so-far-as production values.",1142899200,3,1294,4.42436974789916
1785342,5,B00006LPBO,"Any DMB will realize that the concert is the typical incredible blood flowing sound combination of violins, flutes with a jazz back tone.  Yes the panning in and out and split screen shots are annoying but it is a great DVD.  Most DMD ""live"" music is better than studio recorded, you get the real feel for the music and this is evident at Folsom Field.  Big Eyed Fish and Bartender are incredible!  I have never seen Dave whale like he does in Bartender, the combination of hardcare violin and winds is awe-inspiring!  Great music and classic DMB lyrics make this a great buy!",1107475200,5,576,4.553398058252427
1785343,2,B00006LPBO,"This video is not great for a couple of reasons. First of all the material played is some of DMB's worst in my opinion, with the exception of JTR, Warehouse, Watchtower, Stay, Ants, and Two Step. Second of all the video is far to processed. Filmed by over 25 cameras, it is far over done, and the flashing images and split screens achieve the opposite of their goal, by driving my attention away from the performance, and making me dizzy enough to want to stop watching. Neither the CD nor the DVD are worth getting...I wish I had known that before I bought both...alas.",1093046400,9,570,4.490384615384615
1785344,5,B00006LPBO,"As a fan from the UK, I have all the live DVDs. It occurs to me that poor reviews of this production stem from people with no sense of adventure and no imagination. I absolutely love this one. I had forgotten how much until I had a Friday night with no plans and on a whim played this for the first time in a long while. It blew me away. The way it was edited for me encapsulates the essence of DMB. The beauty, the emotion and, let me go out on the edge here, the mind bending experience of a DMB concert is perfectly locked away in this creation. The visuals bring to life what to me is the essence of a DMB concert, which is living in the moment. No matter what has gone on before and what the future brings now is the time. Enjoy!!!",1082678400,3,736,3.97972972972973
1785345,4,B00006LPBO,"DMB's worst concert ever probably blows the best shows of other artists out of the water.  These guys are just so terrific on stage that it almost makes listening to their albums a let down.
Now, I admit, the Central Park show that was released a while after this one is a better show in almost all departments, this one has a few things going for it that the other show did not.
First off, this is the show that wound up starting late because of traffic conditions in the area (DMB wanted to make sure all the fans made it in before starting), and therefore went on later than it was supposed to, resulting in a noise-violation citing for the band.  Kinda cool that they'd put themselves through that for their fans, huh?
Second, ""Bartender"".  I hadn't heard this song yet (for some reason I hadn't gotten around to buying the ""Busted Stuff"" disc, don't ask me why), and I'm glad.  Seeing and hearing for the first time through this particular performance was an experience that will resonate in my musical membranes for the rest of my life.  I'm in a band because I want to be able to make an audience feel the way I did when I watched this performance.
So, grab 'em both!  Folsum Field, Central Park, both are well, well, well worth it.",1073347200,3,1239,4.412280701754386
1785346,5,B00006LPBO,"Dave Matthews and his band really do it this time. Some people think he is a little too hippy, but in actuality, Dave and his sound is very Jazzy. I listen to this on my surround sound; on the big 55' 16x9 TV and I feel like I am right there (minus the crowds). If you like Dave Matthews Band even in the slightest...add this to your collection. There is one song, Angle, where his back-up singers take over a bit, and it is so incredible. That one song is worth buying this DVD for, but trust me, you won't be disappointed in the rest.",1068508800,,536,4.114285714285714
1785347,1,B00006LPBO,"I totally agree with the people who have been putting this thing down. The editing is awful, the sound is just okay, and unless you can find it for cheaper then 20 bucks, its not worth it.
I bought this because I recently bought a new stereo, that supports DTS, SACD's, and obviously 5.1 channel sound. I bought about 4 concert DVD's before this and realized I was missing a DMB concert from my collection. I bought this assuming it would be as good as the other 4 I had previously bought. Its not. The 5.1 Channel is a joke.. The back two channels echo the front channel exactly only 1/8 the volume. Even the front right and front left channels are spotty. Usually they are assigned specific instruments according to the way the stage is set up, etc.. This does not. It simply all comes from the front channel with less and less on the outside channels. Awful.",1060732800,,861,4.421383647798742
1785357,5,B00006LPBO,"I just want to say I was ALMOST put off getting this DVD by all the supposed DMB fans who complained about the editing of this video.
I am a video director, and this concert ROCKS!! Brilliant production all round. As a fan from way back...don't listen to all the idiots here - you NEED this as well as Listener Supported. Both DVD's are different - BOTH great. The set list on Folsom absolutely blows away Listener Supported, though.
One other thing no one else seems to mention - the show is over 2 hours and 30 minutes long - great value.
If you are a fan - BUY IT!!!",1057968000,8,569,4.181818181818182
1785358,4,B00006LPBO,"The show itself is amazing, I have only been to three Dave concerts and this is better than seeing them live, but the DVD continously goes to a three way screen, showing Music Video clips and other crap.  The the screen that shows the concert is too small and would be much better without it.  The only reason this gets a 4 from me is because of the terrific show.  Check out Big Eyed Fish and Warehouse.  They are both great in this concert.  The CD is a much better buy here!",1053648000,,477,4.141304347826087
1785359,5,B00006LPBO,"if you are not touched, motivated, or blown out of your seat with this dvd, you are not a dave fan. This is the best dvd I think I own, I got the cd first and I thought what a great setlist, sounds awesome. When I got the dvd and watched it, I could not believe it. I am so proud to call myself a dmb fan with this dvd and the performance they out on. much love",1048550400,2,361,3.641025641025641
1785360,5,B00006LPBO,"Of all of the band's live albums (Red Rocks, Listener Supported, Chicago) this has the most incredible set. It includes most of their best songs like: Ants Marching, Everyday, Crash into me, Watchtower, Warehouse, Don't Drink the Water, What would you say, and so much more. Musically it's incredible. Sure, there were a lot more camera angles on this than that of Listener Supported, but the set of this blew Listener Supported away. They are both great dvds, but this one's my favorite. Of all of their CDs, this was the best too. I was very impressed with Live at Folsom Field. It was not as conservative as Listener Supported though. Perhaps not something that kids should watch. It contains some profanity, brief nudity (in the audience) and some drug content (lyrics and audience). All in all though, it's amazing.",1046995200,4,820,4.864285714285714
1785361,4,B00006LPBO,"Some people have said they don't like this DVD because of the editing style and enjoy Listener Supported better than this disc. I have to disagree. The Band is tighter than ever, they give it their all and then some, particularly on All Along the Watchtower - which I was blown away by because I have never been a fan on DMB's version but now am having second thoughts.
I feel this disc captures the enery of a DMB show far better than Listener Supported, a performance I feel the band was not really into and kinda lulled through. Outside of being in with a group to dance with and the sent of marijuana, this is as close to being at a DMB concert than actually being at a DMB concert.b",1046390400,2,687,4.251908396946565
1785362,5,B00006LPBO,"After a few months of reading these reviews I felt the need to qualify many of them. Some of DMB's harshest critics are also their most devoted fans. Every piece of work is analyzed to the highest degree. If the work isn't near perfect then for whatever reason the band is blasted for creating something unsatisfactory. The funny thing is though, even though they blast it you can bet they own it. So, the bottom line is that you can't apply a devoted fan's review to the average consumer. The fact of the matter is that this is an incredible DVD which showcases the genius of who is considered to be the greatest touring band ever. Sure, the video editing is at times disconcerting but you get used to it pretty quick. The 5.1 audio is nothing short of top notch, and the set list is awesome. Old material, new material, and everything in between. Do youself a favor and pick up this DVD. The pure musical talent and energy that these guys bring to the stage has never been matched and probably never will be.",1042761600,7,1010,4.435483870967742

1785364,5,B00006LPBO,"I liked the quick shot editing--I think it works well with the stimulation and excitment of the music.  ""I did it,"" was never one of my favorites, but here, I love it, as I see the crowd get down and dirty, having fun, and see the quick visual of the girl energetically brushing her black hair behind her ears while simling, bobing her head, and licking her lips.  I'm glad they threw that in there, although others might think it qualified as just another herky-jerky MTV style edit.  Seeing the crowd groove, and hug eath other, to Dave is almost as much fun as listening to Dave himself, because, afterall, that night, he made it for them.  And it's an attractive crowd.  The outdoors effect is beautiful as well--it almost seems as if The Band plays the sun down themselves, during ""Bartender.""  My only complaint is that it appears as if the saxaphone mic droped dead, near the end.  But otherwise, a very stiring, emotinal, and beautiful concert DVD, which demonstrates just why so many are captivated by the music.",1038441600,5,1021,4.638888888888889
1785365,3,B00006LPBO,"The concert gets 5 stars.  Great selection of songs and an excellent performance from the band.
The sound gets 4 stars.  Although good overall, the sound mix could have been better.
The image quality, well.......I'll get to that later.....
The mixing of the image.....I'm not as annoyed as other reviewers but in a way I agree with them, why so many changes ?....change is good....but I would have liked to see Dave and the guys for slightly longer periods of time (just a second or two would have made such a difference).
OK. Image quality....why go from a full screen image to a widescreen want to be with three different views that on a full screen tv look so small.  You loose the intended effect.  Concert DVD's should all be in WIDESCREEN ANAMORPHIC format.  THERE IS NO EXCUSE.  Diana Krall's - Live in Paris, Yes - Live in Amsterdam, Roger Waters - In the Flesh Live, David Gilmour - In Concert, Sting - All This Time, Neil Finn & Friends - Seven Worlds Collide, Paul McCartney's - Live at the Cavern Club, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band - Live in New York City, etc, etc, etc........are all WIDESCREEN ANAMORPHIC.  I'm sure that the image changes would have looked much better if the center had been left alone (no shrinking) and then the sides would have been replaced by other images.  Besides in widescreen you would have been able to see more of the band at the same time without the need of some many changes.  It would have been a whole different video and way, way better.

7971683,5,B00006LPBO,"I've heard before that some DMB fans consider this DVD to be the 'most commercial' of all the band's releases.  I guess that criticism stems from the fact that the album ""Everyday"" is represented a little more heavily here than it is in any other live album that has been released (which makes sense, because this is from 2001 when Everyday was first released).  But for me, I like hearing the Everyday songs live, as well as the ""Lillywhite"" songs that came right before the Everyday period.  So don't let that be a reason you are not thinking of checking this one out.

This is the only DMB DVD that you will find that has such songs as ""Bartender"", ""Digging a Ditch"", ""Angel"", ""JTR"", ""So Right"", ""The Space Between"", ""If I Had It All"".  In my opinion this DMB DVD has the ""rarest"" collection of songs you will find in comparison to their other video releases.  It's nice to have some variety I think.  So for the rarity alone, this DVD is a must have for any fan.

Make no mistake though, just because there are rarer songs doesn't mean this isn't a quality release.  I have watched this performance over and over again.  I just really like the set, and I enjoy the song choice as I was saying above.  (I mean, Bartender is one of my favorite songs ever - so yeah, it's sweet to see it played live).  It's cool that this was filmed in Boulder - and we all know DMB loves Colorado.  Leroi was on absolute fire on this day.  I could keep going on and on why you should get it.

I really hope that one day this is offered as a Blu Ray - just as I hope the other releases will be as well",1386547200,2,1586,4.2052980132450335

This does not have the same intimate feeling as pretty much any other DMB DVD and it is hard for me to sit down and watch the video all the way through, but I often put it on while sitting around and half watch it and half listen to it while hanging around.
