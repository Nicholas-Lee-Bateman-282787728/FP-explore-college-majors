8217323,5,B000V8ZM18,"I saw this 4 DVD collection of great movies to add to our family collection. United Artist did it right with a separate DVD and jewel box for each movie. The movies were great with superb color and sound. No faults. There were a very few places where the movies very temporarily paused as if edited or spliced.  Very, very slight and quick and INMO did not detract from the movie. All 4 played perfect.

Dr No was the first James Bond 007 movie. It was a low budget movie as no one had any idea that the movie would be such a great hit and the start of the fabulous James Bond 007 series. Sean Connery is introduced as the 1962  handsome, polished/refined British super secret agent 007 licensed to kill. He must defeat Dr No a Chinese scientist that is toppling and making US spacecraft crash off Cape Canaveral. Dr No is  a member of Spectra, a super secret crime/extortion organization. The beautiful and super sexy Ursula Andress ( the original Bond girl) is shown coming out of the water off a beach collecting shells looking  super sexy in a white bikini. A real hotti. Lots of action, fighting, killing and all kinds of super hero/spy activities. I loved this movie because of the superb acting of Sean Connery before the special effects of today's Bond movies became commonplace. Some special effects but the acting and superb plot made this movie. 5 stars

The Magnificent Seven was INMO one of the best westerns ever made. A bunch of Mexican farmers and their families are being attacked and their crops and goods stolen by about 40 outlaw Mexican gunman headed by Eli Wallah. The Mexican farmers hire 7 top gun hands for almost nothing. 20 dollars each...that's all they have..the entire village is poor. This movie was chocked filled with stars. Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Eli Wallace, Charles Bronson, James Coburn and Robert Vaugan. The magnificent 7 gunmen defeat the 40 plus Mexican outlaws in an epic battle. This is an epic western. If you like westerns you will love this movie. 5 stars

Fist full of Dollars was a very good western. Clint Eastwood stars as the man with no name. He is super fast with a handgun. He takes on 4 men one time and more men other times. He gives the undertaker lots of work. 2 rich families are in control of a town and wanting to control more. Clint Eastwood plays a dangerous game helping each family to defeat the other and getting well paid each time. Clint Eastwood's acting was great with his steely squint in his eyes, smoking his small cigar and great lines. The head of one of the families is an expert with a rife and tells Clint Eastwood, when a man with a pistol fights a man with a rife, the man with the pistol dies. NOT!... but look at the way Clint Eastwood outdraws him and 4 others by himself. I won't ruin the movie. Some of the scenes are incredible. 5 stars on Eastwood's acting and the scenery and plot of the movie. Some of the acting by the other actors/actresses was not up to Eastwood's calibur. 3 1/2 to 4 stars on their acting . Total 4 1/4 stars this movie.

The Pink Panther was a very good comedy about a rich Knighted man ( David Niven) who is the notorious jewel thief the Fathom. He is out to steal the Pink Panther one of the world's greatest diamonds from a Princess. He wines and dines her and eventually both are semi in love. Robert Wagner stars as his nephew. Both have the hots for the French Police Commissioner's ( Peter Sellers)wife. Big party scene with fireworks and cars chasing the bad guys in ape costumes. The poor bumbling goofy  Police commissioner actually arrests The Phantom and his nephew only to lose out in court and is sentenced as the The Phantom, while the Princess, the Phantom and nephew get off. A funny, goofy comedy. Just relax and enjoy it without trying to analyze it. 4 1/4 stars

No nudity, sex or 4 letter words in these movies. Great for a family DVD library but some shooting/killing in 3 of the movies. Probably not rated for the very young. Total 4 2/3 stars.",1328832000,,3983,4.473829201101928

There are no extra features on these discs save theatrical trailers, but the films themselves are superb entertainment at a bargain price.
