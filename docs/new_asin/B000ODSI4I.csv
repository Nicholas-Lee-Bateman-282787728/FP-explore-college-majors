8184750,1,B000ODSI4I,"I have wanted to buy the lost episodes on DVD for years. However, I refuse to buy them because they have been so expensive. The ""Classic 39"" episodes (which are masterpieces) cost less than $30 - yet you would have to spend hundreds to get all the lost episodes! They are finally out of print and I hope that if and when they are ever reissued they will be more affordable. I would love to see them again.",1247529600,4,405,4.205128205128205
8184751,3,B000ODSI4I,There is absolutely no reason they can't put all these episodes on half the amount of discs and release a complete series boxed set. That's all I got to say about that.,1246665600,3,168,4.28125
8184752,5,B000ODSI4I,These timeless classics are still funny after all these years.  I still laugh every time I watch them.  Now all that needs to be done is to restore the last of the lost episodes (if possible) still not released and put them on DVD.,1187136000,,231,4.2272727272727275
