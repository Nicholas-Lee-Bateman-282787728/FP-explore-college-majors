3010455,5,B000Y0BJ88,"This DVD is easy to follow and the kids love it. We even end up doing the session together sometimes,the whole family. Make sure you get the PAL version if you're in Europe and the NTSC version if you're in the US. The DVD is available for both systems. Also another great thing! The music is fantastic and creates a movie atmosphere in the room.",1206403200,12,346,4.338461538461538
3010456,1,B000Y0BJ88,"The DVD was defective so I returned it and received a replacement.  It too, was defective.  I would be cautious in ordering this DVD unless you are assured the DVD is not defective.  Amazon was great in sending a replacement (no charge for shipping) and eventually sending me a refund.",1204243200,4,285,4.66

8230518,5,B000Y0BJ88,Easy to follow. I bought it for my son who has autism. He follows along well and says he likes the meditation.,1491609600,,110,4.045454545454546
8230519,5,B000Y0BJ88,Very good.  It adds a nice variety to our growing stash of yoga dvds.,1454889600,,69,3.9285714285714284
8230520,5,B000Y0BJ88,Clear directions for both me and my 7 year old son. Yoga instructior does some segments and a child does some segments. From start to finish 20 minutes which I think is perfect as we are just beginning yoga. I am very pleased with this DVD as is my son.,1425081600,,253,4.08
8230521,2,B000Y0BJ88,"There are eight kids on the cover, along with the instructor. Those kids, with the exception of one of them, are no where to be found in the workout. The instructor does most of the moves and occasionally cuts to clips of one kid doing some moves. The music is beautiful and mellow. The instructor's voice is soothing. The background is so white, it doesn't look like a room actually exists around her. I think this is a great beginner DVD for my mom, who's in her 60s, and new to yoga. I can not imagine why a kid would like it. My daughter has been doing yoga for her whole life (she's almost seven), and she owns another DVD which was shot outside with about six kids in it, and the instructor gave the Sanskrit name, along with the ""nickname"" of each pose (cat, cow, beetle, cobra, mountain, corpse, downward dog, lion, etc...). That is my idea of a yoga DVD for kids. I am mostly disappointed that there are eight kids on the cover and they're not part of the workout. I would consider that to be false advertising. I will mail this to my mom, and hopefully, she'll like it. I personally think it will be perfect for her.",1329350400,4,1126,4.316037735849057
8230522,4,B000Y0BJ88,"I purchased this for my 8 year old son, who is very high-strung. I chose this one because a lot of the other choices available looked like they would be too baby-ish for him, and this one was short and inexpensive.
He watched it for the first time this morning. He really got into it, which hopefully means it won't be a battle to have him do this regularly. I think the 20 minute session will be just right for us. I don't know anything about yoga, so I needed something that could take over for me and let me participate as well.
Also, I was concerned that it would not go along with my Christian views. I wanted the relaxation and stretching benefits, without the spiritual aspect. This does have the spiritual aspect, but I was able to explain easily to my son how to modify it for us.
I think we are off to a great start, thanks to this little dvd.",1314144000,2,853,4.2073170731707314
8230523,2,B000Y0BJ88,My 11 yr. old likes to do yoga. So I bought this for her and she doesnt care for it. She said they go too fast and it's kind of boring. Now it collects dust on the dvd shelf. I would not recomend this dvd.,1290384000,,205,3.577777777777778
8230524,5,B000Y0BJ88,"I love this DVD. It's only 20 minutes but that is just perfect for my daughters. I have tried other DVDs and then they fell asleep! This session has alot of flow and great music to it. I even join them once in a while and it works for me as well. Be careful though not to get the PAL version as I did at first, but make sure it is the right format, NTSC. The PAL version worked on my computer but now when I have the NTSC version we have it up and running on the big screen every day. Actually my kids ask me to put it on. It's a nice mix of san salutations and easy poses for children. Try it!",1268956800,2,594,3.76
8230525,2,B000Y0BJ88,The video is short and I was expecting to see more poses/asanas for kids. There are much better yoga programs/series for kids. I wouldn't recommend this one.,1266710400,,157,4.851851851851852
8230526,5,B000Y0BJ88,"My youngest daughter loves doing yoga.  When our local yoga studio stopped having kids classes, we were both devistated.  I purchased this and two other yoga DVD's from Amazon, and we've been thrilled.",1262217600,5,201,5.0606060606060606
8230527,5,B000Y0BJ88,My elementary P.E students love this video (ages 10-13). They beg me to do the video! Great buy!,1229299200,12,96,4.388888888888889
