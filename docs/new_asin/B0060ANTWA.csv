4912620,1,B0060ANTWA,"This is a 55 minute low budget black and white film about some guys making a low budget porn film. Dialog not too bad, but the film just wasn't entertaining. The jokes were stale. The character of Richard Magnet was annoying. The title promises more than it delivers.

4912621,5,B0060ANTWA,I thought this movie was going to be all sorts of cheesy but it was really good even for an off color film,1387411200,,106,3.652173913043478
4912622,2,B0060ANTWA,"First off, you can buy this film as part of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Extreme-Zombies-8-Movie-Collection/dp/B007V2LN4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Extreme Zombies 8 Movie Collection</a>. And it's widescreen in that collection, not fullscreen like this standalone version appears to be.

Now, this is a fairly bad movie. But it's still enjoyable, at least for fans of low-LOW-budget, amateur efforts. So, because it has entertainment value, I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1.

The story is zombie 101. Very basic. There's a zombie outbreak on a low-budget porn set. Some people are bitten. Surviving cast and crew members hide in various rooms in the house, while zombie porn stars shamble about outside.

This film is what you'd expect. The characters are stereotypical. The egomaniacal director, jaded makeup artist, horny crew member, and diversity of colorful porn stars (the lesbian, the dominatrix, the gay actor -- even an actress who specializes in menstrual sex -- no you don't get to see it).

Despite the story, there's not much nudity. A quick shot of breasts, and a penis shot. Oh, and a zombie eating a penis.

The acting isn't much either. Much of it's wooden. But some of it rises to the level of acceptable.

The dialogue is banal. Lots of cursing. And when the zombies attack, shouts of ""What the hell's going on?!"" Despite that, there are some humorous exchanges which emerge from all the bickering. Yes, there is much bickering. People tend to argue when trapped in a tense situation, barricaded against zombie attacks, planning means of escape, only to see more of the cast and crew attacked and eaten by the walking dead.

This movie is in black & white, which is curious, because it seems to be shot on video. Why? Perhaps as an homage to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/B00000K3TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Living Dead</a>?

It's actually UNDER 50 minutes, if you don't include the credits.

A bad movie, yet I enjoyed it. Partially, I think, because not only do I love horror, but I have a soft spot for any film that occurs on a film set. (The best of which might be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Living-In-Oblivion/dp/B00007L4OB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Living In Oblivion</a>&nbsp;-- See, I have artsy, highbrow taste!).",1363996800,4,2432,5.770949720670391
4912623,5,B0060ANTWA,yes porn star zombies is not the best film in town but it is catchy& made me laugh til it hurt. the soundtrack just rocks &the grindhouse feel makes up for whatever else lacking plus most of the chicks are stunning which is hard to find in lowbudget movies these days. i mean really in response to the review below could u make a film like this on a 10 K budget? prob not & if so prove it could u make a soundtrack that is as awsome as this one all by yourself? prb not & could u be so successful to be the top 5 K on imdb. not even high budget films don't get that kind of luv. oh yea& that zombie was not driving a car. really? he turned as he was driving least thats the way I took it. in fact i consider this film a cult classic cause it broke all the rules films like this aren't supposed to be so popular but it beat all the odds against it. i remember lobbying to get this movie to a film festival and they wouldnt even take a chance on it cause of name alone. i bet those wipes are kicking themselves in the grille right now for not showcasing this film it has been an urban legend since 2008 &finally saw it at brewvies in SL u should have seen it. it was sold out and people were cheering with it like rocky horror. is it as good as rocky horror. not even but I gotta give credit where credit is due for spending 10 K &never giving up I gotta hand it to keith emerson for making an empire from one inde film. he has the kind of guts we all wish we could have but never will. oh yea and that chick with the longlegs &miniskrt steals the sho shes hot&feisty & nice act mmmmmmmmm,1333324800,2,1586,3.913312693498452
4912624,2,B0060ANTWA,"We were not disappointed.  Yes, in a world of small treasures there is the occasional gem hidden amoung the forgotten reels in the long-lost cinema vaults; but this isn't it.  Not that we really expected this to be much more than what it promises, but one can always dream.  Amateur drek involving a bunch of bozos trying to make a porn movie with what looks like some neighborhood friends in the starring and not-so-starring roles, with a lame zombie disease premise laid underneath the plot development to propel this thing to completion.  The main saving grace here is this thing is only 55 minutes long:  The auteur wisely decided to wrap it up before trying our patience with 90 or 100 minutes of feature film  in glorious black and white. For dramatic effect? Because they found some old B/W film stock dirt cheap? Because they could? Who knows.  A few yuks, these are the three stooges of zombiedom, and at least one of them can drive a car; a cinematic first I do believe, at least there is a shot of a zombie exiting a parked car.  Let us ponder the ways.  Yes boys and girls, zombies driving cars.  For those of us who like bad movies and who will accept practically anything.",1328400000,2,1186,4.525821596244131

4912627,4,B0060ANTWA,"This was definitely an ""interesting"" take on the Zombie Comedy genre. Shot in black and white with low to no budget - it was full of cheese, tropes, and cliches but thats what made it fun! Just under an hour long, a quick ""cheese snack"" for zombie fans. This is amusing in its ridiculous. I think some of the negative reviews might be expecting a bit much - Its a zombie STD outbreak on a lampoon of a porn set! That premise alone makes it funny... I didn't pay to see it as it was included with my Prime membership so I got an hour of free entertainment with more class and substance then the political coverage driving me out of my skull on the TV... Whats not to like about that? A winner in my book.",1476748800,5,703,4.138686131386861
