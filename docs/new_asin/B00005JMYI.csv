1529546,1,B00005JMYI,"This movie sucked so bad that we left within the first 7 minutes after it started.  It was one of the worst movies we have seen. Was not funny, jokes were lame and bad, and the story just dragged on, making those 7 minutes seem like an hour. We ended up spending more money (and it was worth it) to see another movie. We would not recommend this show to anyone.",1089417600,8,361,4.084507042253521
1529547,4,B00005JMYI,"This whole movie seems deceptively simple.  Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, a San Diego anchorman, who is a local celebrity and a god among men for simply reading a teleprompter and having intensely primped hair.  When Christina Applegate's character moves into the station and by a freak accident becomes his co-anchor conflict arises, as being an anchor man is a man's job to Burgundy.  Applegate's rise starts liberate the women in the office and make changes for Burgundy's sex driven, macho, misogynist character.  So, the plot seems pretty cliched and obvious, but the movie takes formulas and makes them explode.
Somehow, Ferrell takes jokes that would seem banal and stupid and adds the right tinge of irony and clever characterization to turn create an excellent comedic performance.  Also, the movie itself takes basic movie cliches and heightens them to such a level or ridiculousness that it's difficult not to laugh.  For instance, in one scene, Paul Rudd's character tries to seduce Applegate by using the right cologne.  A secret bookshelf compartment opens up and he applies ""Panther"" cologne to his neck.  Ferrell warns him that he smells like gasoline but Rudd insists that in fact ""It works on women at least 2/3 of the time, all the time.""  Rudd goes into the office and someone complains that it smells like ""A baby's diaper filled with Indian food.""  Another cries that ""Something smells like bigfoot's (...).""  The fire alarm goes off....well you get the idea.
Another scene involves a rumble between the local news stations over their masculine pride and ratings.  At first it looks like a fist fight will start, but suddenly grenades appear, the PBS station becomes involved, medieval weapons are drawn, and celebrity cameos from Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller, and Vince Vaughn are featured.
The film takes these stock moments, in these cases macho male courtship and rivalries and exagerrate them to the highest degree of silliness.  They're so funny while you're watching them that you're able to forgive that the film itself is not that sophisticated and that some of the jokes collapse horribly.
Anchorman isn't exactly a sophisticated social critique or the most intellectual comedy, but somehow it manages to achieve comedic effects in an unusual and interesting way.  When it comes down to it, just thinking of the film makes me laugh a bit, and it's hard to find fault with that.",1089331200,,2421,5.035087719298246
1529548,4,B00005JMYI,"Seeing the words: 'starring Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate' gave me the clue that I would be watching another golden performance from Ferrell himself. But I was still not prepared for how over-the-top and idiotic this film was.
On the other hand, however, I laughed the better portion of my head off - and so did most of the audience. And, when you think about it, that's not a bad way to spend a good 90 minutes in a dark movie cinema, is it?
The film tells the tale of Ron Burgundy, a vain, ridiculous, fictional San Diego television news personality in 1976 who's the #1 network news anchor in the local ratings and presumably based on 70s anchor Harold Green. A billboard says it all: 'If Ron Burgundy says it - it's true.'
He leads a pompous, sexist group consisting of redneck alpha-male sportscaster Champ Kind, played by David Koechner, sleazy Geraldo Rivera-like ladies man in Brain Fantana, played by Paul Rudd, and moronic weatherman, Brick Tamland, played by Steve Carrell, who rebel against the station's manager, Ed Harkin (Fred Willard) when a beautiful woman, Veronica Corningstone, played by Christina Applegate is brought in for diversity's sake.
Burgundy thinks diversity means an old, wooden Civil War ship, but soon falls for the blonde, curvacious former star of Married With Children head over heels.
Unfortunately, a run-in with a burrito, Jack Black on a motorcycle and Burgundy's pet pooch on the Coronado Bridge changes the newsman's life - for the worst (which results on a great scene). With Corningstone's star on the rise and Burgundy in decline, he falls into a three-month drunken stupor (on milk, no less) before an opportunity comes along to change his fortunes.
Like his previous turns in Old School and Elf, as well as most of his characters on Saturday Night Live, Ferrell is as hilarious in his addled simplicity and gives a very good comedic performance capturing the misogyny and ignorance of many 1970s male chauvinist pseudo-celebrities, especially those who populated local TV and radio stations before cable came along.
The silliness of the wild leisure suits, white shoes, overstarched hair, sideburns and mustaches is only matched by the gang fight scene in which Burgundy's group goes up against the likes of other newsmen, including Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller and, of all people, Tim Robbins.
Though it sweetly preaches acceptance and equality, McKay's scattershot comedy is primarily founded on the premise that there's nothing funnier than dialogue strewn with ludicrously illogical lines, such as Burgundy, grief stricken over the sudden murder of his beloved Spanish-speaking dog Baxter (who he refers to as ""a miniature Buddha covered in hair""), screaming to his friend from a phone booth, ""I'm in a glass case of emotion!"" Carell's brain-dead Brick randomly exclaims about women ""I read somewhere that their menstruation attracts bears!"" and Burgundy's vain crew engages in a weapon-filled rumble with Vince Vaughn's competing, second-rated local broadcast team in which the only rule is ""No touching of the hair or face."" Anchorman's satiric skewering of the era's fashion, cheeky optimism, and sexism occasionally grows a bit stale, but it's hard to keep a straight face when somebody thinks San Diego means ""a whale's vagina.""",1089331200,3,3302,5.128014842300557
1529549,2,B00005JMYI,"The two best comedians in the film are Will Ferrell and Steve Carrell.  Both are given some (if not all) of the best jokes of the movie and deliver them fairly well.  This was probably not an accident since both are the best known among the entire cast, (Carrell known for his stint on the Daily Show). The rest of the cast could have been locked in a closet the rest of the time and I wouldn't have noticed or cared.  But who's really going to see this movie for Christina Applegate, Paul Rudd and Adam McKay's acting?  Nobody.
The film is insane, inane, and sometimes just plain stupid but Ferrell and Carrell seem to make it all a little more bearable.
I would suggest this movie instead of Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller's (who both make cameos in this film) current film, Dodgeball, but if you really want to see Ferrell, get the two movies that give him better material for him to work with, Old School or Elf.  Or even get the SNL dvd devoted to him.
Overall, this movie isn't a waste of money or time if you're into movies like Old School and Dodgeball but wait till it shows up on Amazon or Blockbuster.",1089331200,2,1110,4.3173076923076925
1529550,5,B00005JMYI,Anchorman is full of hilarious one-liners that will have you on the floor laughing. The combination of Steve Carell and Will Ferrell created non-stop laughter throughout the whole theater.

1529551,5,B00005JMYI,"I found this movie to be absolutely delightful, FAANTAASTIC!!!  Will Ferrell in my eyes can do no wrong and he comes through again with this hilarious take on the underground news achorman society of the 1970's.  This movie is Will Ferrell comedy at its purest so beware it may be a little over some peoples heads if you are not a true Ferrell fan. This is not like his other roles where he was an actor in someone elses movie this is straight from his head and the comedy is a little off the wall but hilarious.  There are some supporting characters that are also great such as the weather man, whose completely idiotic ramblings are great, especially his statement about bears attraction to certain feminine issues.  Also be ready for some great camios.  So in closing for those who feel Ferrell being Ferrell is pure genius, see this movie immediately and stay classy planet earth.",1089331200,2,884,4.641025641025641

1529553,2,B00005JMYI,"It stars the hilarious Will Ferrell, is co-anchored by the gorgeous Christina Applegate, features cameos by buddies Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Wilson, and the story is about the television profession, in which I've worked for many years.  Yet, somehow, the lead story never hooked me.  As it is often the case with news promos, it stands true for the trailer:  The story sounds riveting until you see the final piece.  The moments of adlib are quite funny, but too much of the film strays away from its original point.  Had the script continued to focus more on the job and less on the love connection, I think the film makers would have had better results.  I am, however, glad to see the lovely Miss Applegate in a role that proves she has more talent than her ""dumb blonde"" typecast. All in all, wait to rent ANCHORMAN, preferably on a ""slow news"" night.",1089244800,3,866,4.590909090909091
1529554,4,B00005JMYI,"Oh my gosh... what a hilarious movie!!  I could not stop laughing throughout the entire film.  Will Ferrell was funny but the guy on his news crew were even funnier.  The story is about Ron Burgundy (Ferrell).  He is the top-rated anchorman in San Diego in the '70s. When feminism marches into the newsroom in the form of ambitious newswoman Veronica Corningstone (Applegate), Ron is willing to play along at first-as long as Veronica stays in her place, covering cat fashion shows, cooking, and other ""female"" interests. But when Veronica refuses to settle for being eye candy and steps behind the news desk, it's more than a battle between two perfectly coiffed anchor-persons... it's war.

1530366,3,B00005JMYI,"Released in 2004 and directed by Adam McKay, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy stars Will Ferrell in the eponymous role as San Diego's top newscaster in the male-dominated broadcasting of the 70s, but that swiftly changes for Ron & associates (Paul Rudd, Steve Carell & David Koechner) when a talented, driven woman is hired for the newsroom (Christina Applegate). Vince Vaughn plays a rival anchorman.

Howard Hawks supplied the simplest definition of a good movie: Three great scenes. No bad scenes. Anchorman gets the first part right with three great comedic sequences (the flute player at the club, the anchorman rumble and the climatic zoo sequence). Unfortunately too many jokes fall flat in between these episodes (Carells outlandish lines in particular) and theres way too much infantile vulgarity. The first half hour is so bad in this regard I almost tuned out. Christina is stunning, though, and never looked better. Whether the positives outweigh the negatives is your call.

The movie run 94 minutes (there are extended cuts, but I strongly recommend the shortest one). It was shot in San Diego, Los Angeles, Long Beach and Glendale, California. WRITERS: Ferrell & McKay. ADDITIONAL CAST: Jack Black, Ben Stiller and several others have cameos.

I have seen it many times since and have no idea why I thought that. This movie is hilarious! It's the 1970s and at a news station at San Diego, the anchors are all men. The times are changing and a woman named Veronica wants to be an anchor. The men, Ron, Brick (weather), Champ (sports), and Brian (field reporter) pull out all the stops to get rid of her, but nothing works. She's there to stay. Eventually Ron gets to like her, but then everything goes wrong. Can Ron pull it together? Will things ever be the same? Will we ever find that toilet store? The movie is full of great, GREAT one liners and great jokes, and Brick is by far the funniest and most random. You will be laughing so hard and be quoting this movie for days. I love this movie because no matter how many times I see it, it makes me laugh just as much, if not more.",1478217600,2,950,4.0855614973262036

1531123,5,B00005JMYI,"First, let me say right up front that I am  *not* a Will Ferrell fan, generally speaking (although I am a Steve Carell fan, and a Christina Applegate fan - actually it was this movie that made me into a Christina Applegate fan).

[NOTE: I am including a spoiler WAY down below, below the *********s.]

When people who haven't seen Anchorman think about what they think they know about the movie, they think raunch, and Will Ferrell-stupid.

In reality, while there is some raunch (although not much at all) this is a *very* funny movie, with a lot of heart.  It is, in the end, a love story, and a story about redemption - wrapped in lots of slapstick comedy, and also verbal humour.

The cast of Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Christina Applegate and, yes, Will Ferrell, is just perfect casting.  Also watch for cameos by Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller, among others.

I *LOVE* watching this movie with someone whose expectations are pre-set based on what they know of Will Ferrell and what they think they know about the movie, because to a one (and I've watched it with several such people) they have said things like ""I have to admit that I liked it much better than I thought I would"" or ""I have to admit I expected not to like it, but I really enjoyed it!""

So, if you are on the fence about this movie, get off the fence, and watch it. You'll be glad that you did!

IF YOU ARE AN ANIMAL LOVER *READ* THE BELOW SPOILER!!

***************************

Seriously, I mean it, there is a spoiler below, so stop reading now if you don't want to read the spoiler, but it only is a tiny spoiler, but will mean a LOT to animal lovers.

You have been warned!:

***************************
SPOILER FOR ANIMAL LOVERS:

There is a scene where a dog gets punted off a bridge into a river.  You are *certain* the dog has died.  The dog has not died, and in fact makes a comeback towards the end of the movie.",1470096000,5,1892,4.406340057636887
1531124,3,B00005JMYI,"About what you would expect. Most of the humor is straight out of junior high school, and is either sophomorically sexual, or just immaturely dumb. I did laugh at a couple of sight gags, but much of the funny parts consisted of shallow cliche characters acting like caricatures. That's too bad as there were a lot of opportunities to lampoon the 70s and the local TV news industry, but only a few were taken advantage of; most were missed. The characters were not especially appealing and you didn't much care what happened to them. The whole women's lib thing was overdone and inaccurate as women had already broken into TV journalism in a significant way by that time. It was good to see so many big-name actors in small extra roles in this, and Christina Applegate was charming, lovely, and warm as usual, and did the best with the limited character she had to work with. This is not high art by any means, just middlebrow Hollywood schlock. It's another example of how embarrassing the American film industry can be, especially compared to films from other countries. The bears were maybe the best part.",1470009600,,1107,4.711340206185567

1532791,3,B00005JMYI,"Typical Will Farrell movie, which to me means he sells buffoonery to the hilt. For the $5 bucks I paid going in blind on this, I knew I'd get my money back in laughs. Farrell movies aren't usually very complicated, he's essentially the frat boy that isn't afraid to acknowledge he's a frat boy once he got older. I'm no lover of frat boys, but I'm glad his brilliance is being put into making me laugh rather than scheming on Wall Street or in the Oval Office on how to create more derivatives or ""trickle down"" more upon the world. It's no wonder Farrell impersonated George W Bush so well, he knows that works perfectly.

I think Farrell is most awesome as a supporting actor, like nearly all improv comedians he really shines in short bursts but tends to lose momentum when he has to carry an hour and a half show (the GWB ""farewell"" being a major exception). I think it's because most movies made by improv comedians tend to be clever short and strong skits and characters that have been expanded and padded out with enough ""funny stuff"" to merit the time required to consume 90+ minutes of film.

Anchorman is basically your basic satire of perceived 1970's living, with a lot of period costuming and sets along with improv actors riffing on things that can be funny about that period from the perspective of a culture 35-40 years removed. The mustaches, the lapels, the colors, the phrases, etc. It's amusing at times, throws in a little political jab or two that can make you aware of how all news is essentially manipulation of perception, and generally gives a fairly enjoyable escape for a few bucks.

Definitely give this movie a viewing sometime, it's amusing and will give many chuckles. But if you want to see the powerful genius of Farrell, watch his brilliant cameos in Eastbound and Down, Wedding Crashers, as well as his George Bush ""You're Welcome America"" one-man show.",1426291200,2,1889,4.649700598802395

This movie is great, but your average consumer may not get the underlying jokes, or grasp it's over reached attempts at being funny sometimes.

Depending on your tolerance factor, there is some language that I wouldn't want my 12 year old to hear while watching with me, maybe it won't bother you.

Jokes are perfect, the group dynamic of the news team is amazing.  Buy this movie!

Will Ferrell is funny in the movie along with the other actors. The humor is one to me that takes a little to get used to but if you just watch it and take it for what's worth you will enjoy the movie.

I know I was sitting there, wishing I could actually see Will Ferrell on the evening news every single night...that would be a great way to end the day.  But alas, it's only a movie...which unfortunately ends at some point.  So all I can do is praise it.  The cast was great, the jokes ranged from funny to hilarious, and everything was well put together around a solid plot.  My favorite character was Brick Tamland, played by Steve Carell, but maybe it was his interactions with the other characters that I liked the most.  He was never put down for his cognitive disabilities, but rather everyone made the effort to integrate him with them...that's something Hollywood needs to show more often.  That and just about everything else made this film worth while and extremely funny.  Go out and get it yourself.  Enjoy.",1403740800,,861,4.6490066225165565

1534640,3,B00005JMYI,"I don't have a lot of nice things to say about the quality of Amazon (or Netflix's) streaming, however. It's over compressed, and even with very high speed internet (like I have), it frequently drops the ""HD"" feed to even more pixelated SD... and the audio is no better than ""ehh.""

You can partially blame the ISP's for throttling these services (they're guilty as charged), but even when the ""HD"" signal locks on, you're in for a softer, less detailed image with some macroblocking during fast camera pans or other rapid movement.  The source is bit starved, plain and simple.

If you want the best A/V currently available and/or are looking to collect your favorite movies... it's still the venerable Blu-ray disc format all the way.

As for the movie itself, it is not as good as the hype.  Silly in some instances, yes.  Unintentionally hilarious in a couple spots, absolutely.  If you're looking for any kind of a coherent plot, look elsewhere.  Even other movies in this wacky, nonsensical subgenre definitely hold up better:  Dodgeball, The Wedding Crashers, Blades of Glory, Old School, etc.

Amazon Instant Video has the PG-13 cut of the film, but don't let that dissuade you.  The unrated version is surprisingly less funny and actually cuts out a few of the better laughs from the theatrical version for cheap crudeness.",1403308800,,1332,4.875555555555556

Instead, I found a crude, vulgar, classless depiction of all that was bad about 70's broadcast journalism. After the first 10 minutes of this film, my sensitive 14-year old son suggested we turn it off. He and I were both offended by the drugs, alcohol, and very open sex-talk depicted in the movie's opening party to celebrate their no. 1 rating. When will film executives remember that the best comedy does not require swearing, alcohol, scantily clad women, and all things promoting an animal-type of sexuality?

1535084,1,B00005JMYI,"It's always disheartening to watch a really funny trailer for a movie, and then realize after wasting time watching the movie that the funny scenes from the preview weren't actually in the movie to begin with- they cut up scenes from the movie and re-did them to make them actually funny. We've fallen far when those who make the trailers for movies have a better grasp on humor than those who write the movies themselves.

Anchorman makes no effort to disguise what it has in store for us as at the onset the characters take turns introducing themselves and tell us about -among other things- specifically what they've named their left and right testicles. While I'm sure this is supposed to be hilarious, personally I just don't care.

Next the story has a line-up of scenes of poorly-attempted blatant sexual harassment towards a female news anchor and a lot of men being sexist idiots. The ridiculous nature of their behavior is, of course, part of the joke. I'm just not sure why it's funny exactly. I suppose it is along the same lines as slapstick. Why is watching people get injured funny? Who knows, yet I laugh every time. Why is watching men behave like outrageously sexist hormonally-driven, totally moronic bafoons funny? Who know, yet apparently this sort of humor goes over well with many.

Yet this film stoops even lower than that. At one point a mentally retarded character, while in a verbal fencing match with a competing news station, quips ""...where did you get those clothes, the ...toilet store?"" This isn't even men behaving badly, this is just a bad joke being delivered badly. I understand why clever jokes are respected and laughed at, but I'm pretty sure bad jokes were named 'bad' for a reason. As in they're not funny. So why is someone delivering a bad joke badly... funny?

Don't get me wrong, this film did have its rare moments. For example the characters' fears that the female news anchor's menstrual cycle might attract bears - lines like that have a feel of something resembling wit that the rest of the movie almost universally lacks.

There will be those who will read this review and say the problem lies with the movie having a sense of humor that I simply don't get, and that if I did get it, I'd find it hilarious. And in a way that's true, humor is entirely subjective. So if you're reading this and thinking 'I don't know what you're talking about, that sounds funny!' then by all means see this movie. If you're like me however and don't find a man's erection to be funny enough to warrant seemingly endless minutes on camera while we're supposed to be laughing but we're not, then save yourself some valuable money and look elsewhere for entertainment.",1396915200,5,2701,4.701902748414376

When you (i.e. CNN) have ""time to fill""... just start making it up and call in a few ""experts"" to speculate upon your very own speculation.  My girlfiend called this morning to say that CNN was actually doing a ""news story"" today on how well they (CNN) covered the many ""different angles"" of the jet airliner disappearance.

1535849,5,B00005JMYI,I love the special features and even the additional Movie from the cut footage. (it's amazing how much there is!) I HIGHLY recommend this to any fan of the Film.,1391731200,,161,4.4
1535850,1,B00005JMYI,A movie that is too silly to be funny...Sexual undertones in some of the humor...Not for children. (or some adults),1391644800,,115,4.8
1535851,5,B00005JMYI,"This was  great upgrade for a hilariously immature movie.  I especially like seeing the Alternate movie.  It was more or less ""Anchorman 1.5"".  Plus there was almost an hour of deleted scenes that were in neither version.  So they must have filmed way too much material.",1391644800,,270,4.782608695652174
1535852,4,B00005JMYI,"I thought it was a great movie. Took place in the 70's, which was kind of funny in it self.",1391644800,,91,3.6
1535853,5,B00005JMYI,"Will Ferrell is great as the Anchorman, and Christina Applegate is a perfect compliment to his 1970s male-centric views.  Who knew rocking on the flute was even possible!",1391472000,,170,5.071428571428571
1535854,1,B00005JMYI,"We watched this for about 20 minutes and turned it off. It was just not our type of humor. Perhaps if we'd have been drinking heavily beforehand, we'd have enjoyed the 4th grade boy humor.",1391472000,,188,4.4
1535855,1,B00005JMYI,"So many people recommended that I get this movie. They said ""oh, you have to watch Anchorman so that you'll get Anchorman 2, which is out now"" I thought well OK I'm always up for a comedy. I guess I'm more of a blazing saddles guy and I found this to be a complete turd. Couldn't watch through to the end.",1391472000,,305,4.016393442622951

1535957,2,B00005JMYI,"I love Will Ferrell, so I expected to, and wanted to, like this movie; but I couldn't do it. I even live in San Diego where the movie is based. About a third of the way through, my husband and I looked at each other, and decided to bail. The 4.99 we'd paid wasn't worth the pain of the infantile humor and slow story line. Christine Applegate was the only thing worth watching.",1391385600,,377,4.178082191780822
1535958,1,B00005JMYI,"Frustrating that we're all set to watch a movie, are immediately charged for it, and then are unable to download it.  I get ATT U-verse stuff just fine.",1391385600,,152,4.428571428571429
1535959,1,B00005JMYI,This movie wasn't funny.  There wasn't much of a plot and the attempts at humor didn't hit the mark at all.,1391385600,,107,4.095238095238095
1535960,1,B00005JMYI,Everyone seems to love this movie but I just couldn't like it. It wasn't funny at all to me. Sorry.,1391385600,,99,4.0
1535961,5,B00005JMYI,"Even better than Anchorman Two, which is in the theatres now. And, a ""must see,"" before the new one. Will Ferrell best movie by far.",1391385600,,132,4.32
1535962,3,B00005JMYI,"It was a silly movie with quick laughs.  The kids liked it and I liked the 70's reminders. I liked the cast, and that they made it like any idiot can read the weather.",1391299200,,167,3.911764705882353

1535964,5,B00005JMYI,"best i've seen in a long time. loved every moment of it and it really needs more views! no complaints on my side but if you want to see will ferrell at his best, then you better get your scotch ready and enjoy this ride.

1536048,1,B00005JMYI,"Being entertained by all the Ron Burgundy Dodge commercials, I decided that I would like to see this movie.  I expected some crude humor, but what I didn't expect was non-stop crude and offensive ""humor"".  We had all we could take after 10 minutes or so and turned it off.  Will Ferrell is such a funny guy and I wish he would make family-friendly movies.  This one is just plain nasty.",1390953600,,386,4.394366197183099
1536049,4,B00005JMYI,"Some parts raunchy, some parts truly funny, some parts stupid but funny.  Not for children in my opinion.  Lots of giggles.",1390953600,,123,4.809523809523809
1536050,5,B00005JMYI,"My husband had never seen this.  I had but was willing to watch again.  We really enjoyed it.  They are just insanely stupid to the point of hilarity, plus we know the sequel is out so I wanted to see this again.",1390953600,,212,4.0
1536051,1,B00005JMYI,"I don't see what the appeal is here, and why a sequel was warranted.  The only reason I finished watching it, was so I could have a better idea of why I think this is such a stupid movie.",1390867200,,187,3.7948717948717947
1536052,5,B00005JMYI,It is hilarious. Really well written. If you like step brothers you will love this film too. We've watched it like 3 times in the past few months even though we saw it years ago too.  It is solid.,1390867200,,196,4.0256410256410255
1536053,1,B00005JMYI,I can see why some people would like this but I just couldn't get past how stupid it was.  The acting was really good though.,1390867200,3,125,4.0

1536155,3,B00005JMYI,"I found I was waiting for it to end. It didn't live up to what I had ""heard about it"". Disappointed. I would have to be in a ""slap happy"" mood to find it funny. Maybe better if I watched it with a group ??",1390521600,,205,3.577777777777778
1536156,1,B00005JMYI,"Not nearly as good as people said it was. Little thought put into it, typical Will Farrel, just because a lot of funny actors are in this movie doesnt make it funny.",1390435200,,165,4.1875
1536157,3,B00005JMYI,"Save this for late night viewing. This film portrays the juvenile antics of self absorbed TV news personalities. Some scenes are funny others are just stupid. That said, Will Ferrell does a good job.",1390435200,,199,4.882352941176471
1536158,1,B00005JMYI,Predictable and a bit over the top.  This is a genre that does not need to exist.  I wish that humor was more closely aligned to the common experience.,1390435200,,151,4.172413793103448
1536159,1,B00005JMYI,Even my 14-year old who insisted on watching it turned it off 20 minutes into the movie. Terrible script and waste of good talent from the star studded cast! Skip it...,1390435200,,168,4.451612903225806
1536160,3,B00005JMYI,"I think some parts are very funny, but at times, it left me waiting a little to long for the next part that I found funny. I didn't like the scenes where he was down on his luck. I guess I would have liked less plot or story line and more of Will Ferrell making a fool of himself.",1390435200,,280,3.76271186440678

1536162,3,B00005JMYI,Had some good laughs and funny lines but not appropriate for under 13 due to some Gordy sevens and sexual content.,1390348800,,114,4.476190476190476
1536251,1,B00005JMYI,It would've been funny if there was no cursing and dumb punch lines. I would not bother to buy this.,1390262400,,100,4.05

1536253,3,B00005JMYI,Funny but it will not be on my must own list.  Too much wierd  stuff and awkword to watch with the kid.,1390176000,,103,3.6363636363636362
1536254,1,B00005JMYI,"You'd think with all the A-List comedians that were in this film, it would've been a home run. Didn't like it.",1390176000,,110,4.285714285714286
1536255,1,B00005JMYI,"With these many of my favorite actors in the movie, the movie was a complete waste of my time.

1536260,4,B00005JMYI,I have never seen it.  But I want to see the sequel in the theaters so this brought me up to speed.  It was pretty funny.,1389916800,,121,3.6153846153846154
1536375,3,B00005JMYI,"Kinda dumb.  Great period clothes, though!  Great soundtrack.  Stupid guys movie.  This is the rest of the words required, really.",1389830400,,130,5.35
1536376,2,B00005JMYI,"This movie has been Over hyped. I really don't like Will Ferrell's humor too much, and this was really absurd.",1389830400,,110,4.55
1536377,5,B00005JMYI,Come see how good I look! This is a perfect movie that is endlessly quotable. You will love it. A+,1389744000,,98,3.95

1536379,4,B00005JMYI,"Anchorman has a plot, sort of, but what it does have in abundance is a lot of gags, verbal and physical, all moving so fast that you have don't have time to consider if they're really funny. This anything goes attitude is contagious. Ron Burgundy and his news crew are the epitome of macho stupidity and crass, but when a woman shows up in their contained universe, they turn out to be a most pathetic bunch of losers. Lots of wonderful gags along with the misfires, but why care? As entertaining an hour and a half as you'll find, and, of course, Will Ferrell has it. It takes a star to make an idiot so likeable.",1389744000,,614,4.301724137931035
1536380,4,B00005JMYI,We really enjoyed Anchorman.  It was easy to watch and had lots of laughs. Will Ferrell and Steve Carell are especially funny. I would recommend it for adults over 17 because it does have some adult themes and situations.,1389657600,,221,4.666666666666667
1536381,2,B00005JMYI,The movie was a one liner.  Very predictable and unevenly paced. Did not convey a firm sense of the period either.,1389657600,,114,4.428571428571429
1536382,4,B00005JMYI,"If you like a cult classic to quote then this is your movie, for sure!  Watch it with someone psyched on women's empowerment, their reactions are classic!",1389657600,,154,4.703703703703703
1536383,1,B00005JMYI,Not as funny as I remembered.  Sure hope the new one is  better.  It certainly has received a lot of publicity,1389657600,,110,4.142857142857143

1536478,3,B00005JMYI,"Not  ""Elf "" funny. Along the lines of ""Talladega Nights "" funny - has it moments , but some stuff is a little forced and doesn't quite flow at times . A little tweaking and reshoot and it coulda been very funny.
In the end I wasn't excited to see Anchorman 2, which is why I watched this .",1389657600,,289,3.8983050847457625
1536479,1,B00005JMYI,"Stupid movie. I never actually laughed, just smiled a few times. You should watch it though because it's a classic and if you want to see the second (better) one, you need to see this one first for it to make sense.",1389657600,,215,4.142857142857143
1536480,1,B00005JMYI,"it was so disgusting, I could not laugh even when it was funny. We could not watch the whole thing. The ads for Anchorman II looked hilarious, so I thought we should watch the first one. BAD MSTAKE!",1389571200,,198,4.2368421052631575
1536481,2,B00005JMYI,The video and audio quality was good.  I streamed the video thru my Nintendo Wii. I did not like the movie since there was a lot of rude and toilet humor that not needed to make it funny.,1389571200,,187,3.9210526315789473

1536553,2,B00005JMYI,Yawn! Sorry folks Old School was better....this movie is flat filled with cheap sex jokes and people that are so obnoxious who cares what happens to them...I guess if you like pompous asses shouting like they're at a Super Bowl game then this is for you....Me?

1536555,5,B00005JMYI,Great film with a great cast. Ferrell at his silliest and his best. Steve Carrell steals a bunch of scenes. Tons of quotable moments. Great movie and a very nice blue ray set.,1389312000,,175,4.333333333333333

1536559,5,B00005JMYI,"Anchorman is easily one of your most quote-able movies of all time.  If you are in to silly/stupid humor it's going to have you laughing literally from beginning to end.  If you are looking for a comedy that doesn't involve getting into a slap fight with a grizzly, you're in the wrong spot.  This is basically your typical Will Ferrell movie. Be prepared to laugh!",1389225600,,365,4.584615384615384

I figured there would have to be enough comedy to out-weigh the ""stupid"".  I got it soooo wrong- -for my taste any way.  I won't make the same mistake when 'Anchorman 2' comes out.",1389225600,,353,4.147058823529412

1536760,2,B00005JMYI,Figured I'd give this one a try since the new one just came out. The only character that is remotely entertaining is Brick (Steve Carrell). Other than that it's one bad joke after another with a childish and narcissistic plot. If you like Will Ferrell jump into this movie. If not pass and find something else.,1388880000,,310,4.553571428571429
1536761,2,B00005JMYI,"I usually love Will Ferrell but he along with the rest of the cast were not funny, mostly because the storyline was not funny.  While many diversity work ""rules"" were indeed true, I don't think that was the point of this story.  It was supposed to be a comedy, right?",1388880000,,267,4.32
1536838,1,B00005JMYI,"Will Ferrell has always been hit or miss with me, and like his movies, most are misses.  He's a one trick pony who plays the same stupid one dimensional SNL character in every film, to varying degrees; the best being Step Brothers, A Night at the Roxbury, The Other Guys, Zoolander ... okay, and I  kinda liked Land of the Lost, only because I had expected to hate it so much, based on the reviews, that I found myself chuckling; certainly more than I ever did during Anchorman; which I originally saw years ago... and aside from one line from an extra, I didn't laugh..

Since the sequel just came out, I figured I would give this thing another chance... Again, except for the same one line.. I didn't laugh. . . The subject matter could have been hilarious, I'm a fan of almost everyone in tis film. I did/do like Christina Applegate, but even she couldn't save this mess.

Will Ferrell just isn't funny anymore...and they need to stop showing close ups on this mouth - we get it! he's got jacked up teeth.. I don't know if that's supposed to be funny or what, but it's gross to keep having to look at all his bottom crooked teeth facing all over the place.

I know the sequel just crossed the $100 million mark (domestically), and while I'm not interested in seeing it, based on the promos, the insipid Dodge faux ads and the SNL appearances, regarding the sequel, it's second verse the same as the first. As far as the big box office, I can only say that society relates to simple minded movies like Anchorman because it's kind of a reflection of the people going to see it... and people like to see characters they can relate to, which also explains why after all these years,Jerry Springer and Maury Povich are still big hits..

It is very slapstick and a lot of them are really stupid but it doesn't make me laugh. So did Anchorman 2! It sucks so much I wanted to sleep! I would've rather watched a chick flick.

1538162,4,B00005JMYI,"Set during a period when men were men and women were ... just there, THE LEGEND OF RON BURGUNDY looks at the lives of a crack local television news team headed by the eponymous hero (Will Ferrell).  While spending their lives covering stories of astonishing banality, they believe they are the best at their various jobs: even Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) who can barely string two words together without the aid of an autocue.  Their lives are thrown into chaos with the arrival of Vanessa Corningstone (Christina Applegate), who proves herself much superior in terms of television technique, while remaining strangely impervious to the team's sexist (and cringingly obvious) attempts to get her into bed.  The scenario here is a familiar one, reminiscent of SWITCHING CHANNELS (1988), or more famously HIS GIRL FRIDAY (1941) in which the newsroom becomes the arena for an analysis of sexual politics.  Both director Adam McKay and Ferrell (who co-wrote the script) are concerned to show limited the opportunities for women are in professions historically deemed ""male"" (such as the media).  But the film never takes itself too seriously, with joke after joke piling on top of one another, both visual and verbal.  As Burgundy, Ferrell is both repellent yet attractive; we understand how his personality is determined by his television image - nothing exists underneath.  By the end, however, even he has dimly become aware of the importance of changing his world-view so that he and Vanessa can work together harmoniously in the future.",1387929600,,1538,5.128

1538261,4,B00005JMYI,"Even though I see a lot of movies, I somehow had managed to miss this one... until now! Ahead of possibly going to see the sequel, I watched the original one the other evening at the strong recommendation of my 26 yr. old son, who had been telling me I was missing out.

""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" (2004 release; 94 min.) brings the story or Burgundy (played by Will Ferrell) and the rest of the 6 pm news team at Channel 4 in 1970s San Diego. The main news story is that a giant panda at the San Diego Zoo is pregnant. One day, in order to advance ""diversity"" (which Burgundy thinks is ""an old wooden ship used in the Civil War era""), an ambitious woman (played by Christina Applegate) is added to the news team. Chaos ensues after that on all fronts. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, given the huge reputation as a ""can't miss, classic"" that this movies now carries, I was prepared to be disappointed, but it turns out to be pretty good. The zingers fly almost non-stop left and right, some of which stick, others not so much, but it leaves you smiling most of the time. Second, even though this is of course a Will Ferrell vehicle (he co-wrote the script), the big surprise for me was Christina Applegate, who more than holds her own in this male-dominated cast. When she gets into a huge argument at one point, she screams ""I'm good at 3 things: fighting, screwing, and reading the news!"", and you more than believe her. Steve Carrell is brilliant as the simple-minded side-kick. And what a surprise to see Seth Rogen in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance (one of his first roles ever), as well as Ben Stiller (he at least gets a few minutes of screen time).

Bottom line: this is a funny comedy that had me smiling much of the time as I was watching this. After seeing this, I cannot even imagine that the sequel can be anywhere near as good as this, and the reported 2 hr. running time of the sequel seems incredibly long. I guess I'll find out for myself in the next few days. Meanwhile, ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is solid, period.",1387843200,,2188,4.451371571072319

1538581,5,B00005JMYI,"If you don't know by now the movie Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is kind of a big deal. It is one of the most iconic comedy movies of all time and is deservedly so. The movie, which debuted in 2004, is set in seventies, but it does not feel dated at all. In fact, it takes full advantage of its setting, expertly using it as a springboard for its plot and some jokes. The movie has a great cast, full with some of Hollywoods best comedic actors, such as Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, and Vince Vaughn, who all put on fantastic performances. For each character there are multiple one-liners, with each one as good as the next. This myriad of hysterical, albeit stupid, lines makes for what is in my estimation the most quotable movie ever.
Unlike other movies of its kind, Anchorman never seems to get stale. I have watched it countless times and find that it is hilarious every time, even though I know practically every line by heart. If you are one of the few people who have yet to see this masterpiece, I highly recommended it (as if you already couldn't tell). This is without a doubt Ferrells best work and the perfectly crafted Ron Burgundy, his best character.

Will Ferrell totally redeemed himself to me after my first experience with him, which was ""Elf"", and which I hated tremendously. It's probably because I didn't grok (""get"") Will Ferrell's humor, but now that I do, I've watched a bunch of his movies and will probably try Elf again.

The laugh density far surpasses any other comedy I can think of. I was never really a will Ferrell fan before this. I think about his time on SNL playing that cheer leader I literally changed the channel. He's not like that at all in Anchorman. He's much closer to fake Alex Trebek on Celebrity Jeopardy, which is to say, Awesome.",1378425600,,545,4.25

Crude humor works with middle school students, but I'd like to think some of us are attempting to grow up.  We turned the movie off after 15 minutes and went to Netflix and watched an episode of Frasier.  It was a lazy movie.

1540513,2,B00005JMYI,"This movie overall was not a good piece of work. I do not remember any funny lines or anything that really made me laugh. The only saving grace is the acting. However the plot and the script leaves much to be desired. I would not watch it again.
  1) Plot - The movie starts with a very good idea, being about a 70's news anchor. This is what drew me in to see it. Unfortunately I would rate it a complete failure as a script and plot. I cannot really think of one scene or line that was great. Compare this to ""Bridesmaids"" or ""Talladega Nights"". Anchorman was a complete miss in this regard. It is a completely boring, unfunny, uninteresting plot which becomes a chore to sit through.
  2) Acting - Will Ferrell and Applegate and a host of actors (Vaughn, Robbins, etc) all brought much energy to the movie. Unfortunately they had nothing to work with regard to the script and plot.
  3) Environment - The clothing was interesting in showing the 70's but overall it was not impressive. I would have liked to see more shops, technology, and other images that captured the world of the 70's.

  It is worth seeing once because of Will Ferrell but I think that few are going to think it is funny or worth seeing again. I had to force myself to not fast-forward through the DVR recording.",1370044800,,1286,4.3924050632911396

The film has another big name on the cast in Steve Carell, and the oldies soundtrack is great, but the humor in this comedy is hit-and-miss; there are several laugh-out-loud moments, but a lot of the other attempts at humor are overly contrived and fall flat.

1540772,3,B00005JMYI,"Are there funny moments in Anchorman? Sure there are? Does it make me laugh from beginning to end? No, certainly not. Like Airplane it bombards the viewer with so many gags, hoping that they'll all work. Unlike Airplane, it fails. Most of the scattershot attempts at humor are just terrible. What's the deal with the gang suddenly singing 'Afternoon Delight'? Is this supposed to be hilarious? It's nothing. It slows down the movie. The narration is completely unnecessary and the hype, within the movie, around Ron Burgandy is distracting. He's not really a great character and exists in his own world of surreal nonsense instead of being more reality-based like the lesser characters (much like Jim Carrey with Ace Ventura). Had there been a more human element to Burgandy it might have made for a slightly better movie.

The thin story, so weak it cannot stand on its own two legs, has a woman arrive at a male-dominated newsroom in 1970s San Diego determined to prove she can be just as good. The men react with horror. They clash. The material is so thin it is 2-dimensional. If you need any more proof check out the utterly terrible 'lost' Anchorman movie Wake Up, Ron Burgandy, a so-called movie assembled from deleted scenes and plots. Much of Anchorman should have been deleted too, but then the running time would barely exceed 70 minutes. Adam McKay and Will Ferrell simply did not have enough mileage for a feature length movie with this anorexic premise.

For all his screaming and attention-seeking it's somewhat ironic that Will Ferrell's never became a superstar, while supporting actor Steve Carrell went on to much bigger and better things. He's clearly the best actor of the bunch and the movie would be substantially even less funny without him.

It is sporadically funny. It is not as funny as the mass hysteria would lead you to believe. It is not a classic.

The Blu-ray looks great in 1.78:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. There are extras that I couldn't care less about.",1359244800,,1993,4.801749271137027

Ferrell has rounded up a posse of idiots in Champ, a loud-motuhed drunk with a country hat, Brick, who is very weird (and funny) indeed and the guy with the moustache, Fantana, all led by Rob Burgundy, who you wouldn't want to have reading the news, which is most exciting when reporting on cat beauty contests and panda bears giving birth.

Sure, the movie is funny, but it's just not a great movie - The ending is so bland, with the rival reporter kissing him, and the idea aren't coming; Ferrell and his posse just act silly and clown around, but they ideas just aren't there. It's worth around 2 1/2 - alright for a viewing experience, a few laughs, but not much else. By the way, I thought Steve Carell was the funniest in the movie as  the character Brick.",1346889600,,976,4.3812154696132595

Take it a step further Steve Carrell gained prominence on ""The Daily Show"" and Christina Applegate cut her bones on ""Married With Children"".  This is a terrific Seventies satire capturing the mores and fashion of that time.  The film makes a point of highlighting institutionalized sexism but oddly glosses over racism but thats a minor quibble.  This may be Ferrell's greatest screen creation with his Burgundy an amalgam of hair, mustache, and pomposity.  Thought it was a nice touch naming his dog Baxter, a reference to the idiot news anchor, Ted Baxter, played by the late, great Ted Knight from ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"".  Equally funny is his rival from another station played by Vince Vaughn is named Wes Mantooth which recalls the bland actor from ""Emergency"", Randolph Mantooth.  I saw this in the theatre in 2004 but it left no impression on me.  Watching it now I appreciate it as a milestone in modern comedy.

the extras are what make this set a steal, blooper reels, commentaries, and a lot of neat extras from before the film came out are included. but what's better than all of that (and in one way disappointing) is the deleted scenes. they are hilarious! there are so many things they took out or changed! (one of my favorite scenes is actually a deleted one where the actor who plays the janitor on scrubs makes a cameo as a police officer, very funny) so many great scenes that it honestly felt like a second (shorter) movie! the only problem with them is it appears that they took it from old analog recordings rather than the digital one the film is shown as on the dvd so it looks grainy which really disappointed me.

But knowing all this, allow me to warn YOU THE BUYER, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SPECIAL EDITION FROM AMAZON! In fact, do not purchase any super-duper-special-deluxe edition from any Amazon page without doing a bit of research and looking through other websites like Best Buy, FYE, Wal-Mart, Target, etc. Amazon's price for this movie is double that of Best Buy. Dont believe me? Go to BestBuy.com and find out for yourself. Best Buy's website offers the movie at 24.99. Amazon charges 49.99. Use your head, save a buck on a great movie.

Best Buy and bestbuy.com have in fact sold out of the film. If you find a copy at your local Best Buy, grab it! As for FYE and other stores/websites carrying this product- Well, it's more of a luck of the draw type thing sing FYE takes in used merchandise and Wal-mart..... is Wal-Mart. Either way, for the savvy shopper who loves Will Ferrel and doesn't want to waste $75 on the Amazon copy or $40 (or more) on the individual sellers copies, keep looking. As cruel as that sounds. But there is something out there, it just hasn't been found yet.

I had originally posted a website here that gave details of the movie for you, the consumer, to buy. Sad thing is, it was a dud. My mistake, and i apologise for the inconvenience it might have caused some people. I will continue to look for this movie at other websites and if I find a good SAFE site that offers the movie at less than what the lowest price Amazon offers, I will immediately post it. But for now, it is safe to assume that the movie has been discontinued for the time being. It may be brought back in the next year or so, but for now, it is as elusive as the Jackalope.",1313020800,9,1956,4.415512465373961
1541341,1,B00005JMYI,"Greetings,

My beef is with the scene where Jack Black kicks a dog off of a bridge, and this is supposed to be humorous.
Frankly, this is extremely disturbing to me as an animal lover.  Perhaps the only thing I hate more than seeing an animal struck (whether real or not) is to see it made into a joke.",1306540800,5,302,4.101694915254237

You must stop the movie and then start it again making sure that the audio is set with the commentary off.",1306108800,,252,4.382978723404255
1541430,5,B00005JMYI,"Ah yes ""Anchorman."" I would say it would have to be one of Will Ferrell's best. Funny cast, funny jokes, funny plot. The cologne gag hysterical, the fight scene too funny.  Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate work well together. As Ron Burgundy would say ""You stay classy San Diego.""",1305244800,,284,4.795918367346939
1541431,5,B00005JMYI,"Ron Burgundy is the funniest guy.  The Afternoon Delight song is the best, the flute scene is great, the scene where Jack Black kicked the dog is the funniest and the News Anchor Rumble is off the charts!! This movie gets a 2 thumbs up!!!",1304899200,,238,4.288888888888889
1541432,5,B00005JMYI,"This movie will help you unwind from a long tiring day.  Will Ferrell is, as always ready to catch you off guard with a line to definitely make you smile or bend over with laughter.  My only caution would be that it contains a lot of adult humor and I would not recommend young children to view this. Just enjoy and you will catch yourself repeating some of the catchy phrases that are said through out the movie.",1302739200,,413,4.282051282051282
1541433,1,B00005JMYI,"I never particularly wanted to see this, but a friend swore I would like it and loaned it to me. About the 12 minute mark, I was ready to turn it off, but I liked ""Blades of Glory,"" after all, so I wanted to give it a fair shot. I lasted about 40 more minutes (for most of which I was always seemed to be a hair's breadth from quitting just before Fred Willard or someone other than Will Ferrell did some mildly amusing).

And then somebody kicked a ""dog"" over a bridge in the name of comedy, and I was done. Out of respect for Christina Applegate I stayed just five more minutes so I could watch her character do one flawless newscast while the idiots around her made faces and *took off their pants* just to try to make her mess up on the air.

In the not-quite-hour that I watched, all the male characters were sexist, boorish morons and the only woman to speak of alternated between being kind of awesome and being a lovestruck idiot. Do not waste your time or money. I certainly wish I could get my hour back.",1302739200,3,1014,4.194871794871795
1541434,5,B00005JMYI,This movie is hilarious. All of his friends who work at the news station are hilarious! This movie has so many parts I couldn't stop laughing. I don't know how they thought of that. One part all the guys who work at different news stations are fighting. It's hilarious! If you like comedies you have to see this! When I saw this movie a couple months ago I couldn't believe I hadnt seen it before.,1301011200,,397,4.306666666666667

There are countless blooper reels, and the interviews with the actors are even hilarious.  Definitely the best way to get the most out of a Will Ferrell movie.  It's also one of Steve Carell's debut movie screenings which he does such a great job in.  I won't give anything away, but in the bonus features they said some things about the history of the movie that really surprised me.  It gives it an interesting perspective.  Anyway, it's a great watch.  Not a kids movie, they probably wouldn't get a good portion of the jokes let alone the how appropriate this would be for them anyway.",1299888000,,685,4.475806451612903
1541436,3,B00005JMYI,This is a super funny movie. Will Ferrell always delivers : ) Anchorman is the kind of stupid funny throughout the whole movie that just causes you to involuntarily giggle. The plotline is so oddball and funny that you can't help but be entertained. The plotline is interesting. I like to watch any movie with Will Ferrell in it. He doesn't really ever let me down. Like this movie! Good entertainment for a day of movie watching!,1299024000,,430,4.597402597402597
1541437,2,B00005JMYI,"So I had it on dvd, now I have it on blue-ray. Love the movie and still do. The main reason for this purchase was the picture, which is very crisp and comparable to the rest of my blue-ray library.

This product has quite a few extras: Some fun extras. Some tedious: the alternate film wake up Ron Burgundy... pedestrian. Some senseless, purposeless, and crass for the sake of crassness alone: the commentary sounds like Will and the director filling time talking about anything but the movie. I listened to the first 5 minutes, then skipped ahead a few chapters and each sample had less to do with movie than the last. I usually get a big kick out of commentaries. This commentary was no more than a ruse so they could print ""commentary"" on the cover of the box. People who like commentaries: hold no false hope for some behind the scenes insight into film making motivations, the creative process, or style of direction. Not included. It wasn't even funny... maybe that is the joke...

I would have happily given up most of the extras to save some clams. My main squeeze and I split the cost, otherwise I would not have paid more than $19. Knowing what I know now about the ""quality"" of the extras, I would have liked to have waited for the price to drop, or found a used copy.

Value: $12 for 1080p version. $17 for fluff.",1297468800,,1325,4.444444444444445

1541516,4,B00005JMYI,"I finally got to see this Will Ferrell vehicle.  Parts of the film were just hilarious, parts not so much, some gross (well, more than some, but we're talking Will Ferrel here), and some tender and romantic (just kidding!).

With over 400 reviews here, I'm not going to re-state the plot or comment on much other than my over-all reaction to the film.  First of all, if you're a Ferrell fan, this is a must-see.  Even if you're not, it's worth the price of admission.  Ferrell is his typical over-grown teenager (again) in Anchorman.  He plays a man-child who is vain, dumb, clueless, awkward, and somewhat sentimental.  He loves his dog, his own mug, his friends, and not much else.

There are fights, sing-alongs, dog punting, dog survival, bikers, women-libbers, homoeroticism, cute girls, sterile apartments, teleprompters, and a zoo.

Mildly recommended.  If the film were edited down a bit to get rid of some of the more stupid scenes (arms getting ripped off, a wild melee between news crews), this would be a better film.  Ferrell is terrifically talented, but only in a set way.  One can compare Ferrell with another SNL alumnus, Bill Murray.  Murray shows range in films such as 'The Razor's Edge' and 'Lost in Translation'.  One cannot imagine Ferrell pulling off either of those films.

Three-and-a-half stars for 'Anchorman'.",1290211200,,1338,4.937219730941704
1541517,5,B00005JMYI,"This limited edition version which is only at sale at a certain retail chain  and here evidently features a interesting box with a 'diary' of Ron Burgundy and trading cards. The package has two blu ray discs with a unrated  version of the movie and a made for dvd flick as well. I don't know if they will release this modern classic comedy on a regular blu ray without the extra film but certainly the packaging will be different after this edition sells out. Making it a collectors edition. This imo is a modern classic comedy, the movie just does everything right , it's funny and has great acting from everyone involved and it features the golden age of news anchorpeople the seventies, that was the decade when women really made inroads into the field and laid the groundwork for all the top anchors that would follow. The seventies too are always a great decade to have a comedy in, it's the predigital age (1980's-) and things were in someways better than today for sure, others not. but at least they didn't have bad rap music to contend with.
The characters are real enough not be believable too, after all the seventies was THe decade of excess and personal out of control freedom gone amuck. The blu ray looks stunning on all versions in this package. This one sold out at the chain store I got it at so grab this limited edition if you are a fan of great comedy and this one has quite a following because in the last decade it was one of the better comedies out there. And this one is without a doubt Will Ferrels most complete character and best work of his comedy career. He just creates a perfect character here which is more realized than some of his others movies characters.",1289088000,26,1691,4.46925566343042
1541518,3,B00005JMYI,"if not for christina applegate starring in this film, it would have tanked!!!
this film took 1hr 7min 19sec to kick-in with the real laughter, otherwise this to me is nothing more than a revised/remake of romano vanderbees 1985 raunch classic
""sex o'clock news"" which itself is 100% hellarious.

this extended unrated version of anchorman:the legend of ron burgundy is a cackle
rather than a belly-laugh of a comedy.

the script is (1970's) junior high school level at best and a soft r-rated for unrated and widescreen. there was supposed to be a sequel to this film which never got off the ground.

again, if not for actress chritina applegate starring in this not-so-funny comedy
i would not have even cared and only because will ferrell's other film ""old school""
was nothing more than a watered-down remake of jim belushi's classic comedy masterpiece ""national lampoons animal house"" which is a whole lot funnier and very much better.

though i own my copy of this film, i will only play it for those whom i deem unworthy to watch sex o'clock news with me.

only if you cannot find a copy (on vhs) of sex o'clock news, should you ""settle""
for this juvenile-insecure-news-boy level comedy. though 1 line did make me laugh very hard, what veronica corningstone wrote as a joke to mock ron burgundy concerening the california city of san diego.<<<GFD I cannot stand this city!!

1541521,5,B00005JMYI,"Along with a fantastic supporting cast, Will Ferrell is at his best. Seems that some of the humor just rocketed over the heads of a few of the negative reviewers. Oddly, with all its goofy hilarity, and through my tears of laughter, this movie really brought back that era with a kind of nostalgic poignancy. If you're a Ferrell fan or came of age in the seventies then do not miss this movie.",1275350400,,393,4.397260273972603

1541524,4,B00005JMYI,"It took me awhile to see this movie. Will Ferrell is someone I can take in doses. Usually I have to be in a certain mood to see one of his movies. I kept hearing how Anchorman was such a great film and wondered what the hype was about. Well, the hype is well deserved.

What we get is the fictional story of Ron Burgundy. Swinging newscaster of the 1970's. He dominates the airwaves and has a way with the ladies. However, all this is about to change as the news station is hiring its first female anchor.

There are many great quotable lines in this movie. The humor may seem pure slapstick on the surface, but there are some clever lines going on in this movie. I have to point out that the news anchor gang fight is worth the price of admission.

The supporting cast did an excellent job. Special recognition should go to Steve Carrell for playing Brick (a not so bright character who only seems to know what is going on with the weather), David Koechner for playing Champ (sports anchor with his own special catchphrase), Paul Rudd as Brian (like Ron, also a ladies man and seems to act as Ron's right hand man). Christina Applegate also deserves a big nod for playing the no nonsense reporter Veronica who is fighting for her right to anchor the news.

There are some surprising cameos as well such as Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins and Luke Wilson. They all help to round out the cast as competing news anchors, with the exception of Jack Black as a biker.

There are also some nice special features on the dvd including Will Ferrell in full Ron Burgundy mode doing a mock interview for ESPN in 1979. There is also an interview with Bill Kurtis and Ron Burgundy done in the style of The Actor's Studio. All about Ron's life and career. Also included are may deleted scenes and out takes from the film.

So, enjoy this movie because... When In Rome......  and

Stay Classy Planet Earth!",1262390400,,1911,4.44
1541525,5,B00005JMYI,"When Anchorman came into theaters, I had just turned 13. I was finally old enough to see a PG-13 movie. Most of the jokes were way over my head, but still hilarious. Now when I watch it, I literally have tears running down my face. Anchorman tells the simplistic story of an acclaimed, arrogant news anchor, Ron Burgundy. Burgundy must adapt to his new partner, Veronica Corningstone, who is an attractive female actress. Like any Will Ferrell movie, the content and story line isn't award-winning but the jokes, one-lines, dry humor, unforgettable cameos and the quirkiness of Ferrell and his cast.",1260748800,2,599,4.9405940594059405

Carell steals the show as the mildly retarded Brick (""Fantastic!""), while Ferrel and Applegate make an interesting onscreen duo. And let's not forget some unexpected cameos in the middle of the film.

1541635,4,B00005JMYI,"Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is a man among men. He's got it all. Good looks, smooth moves, great suits, and the best job in the world as the number one lead Anchorman in San Diego. He even has his own entourage that consists of his fellow newsmen. Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) is the on-scene reporter, as well as a self-proclaimed ladies man. Champ Kind (David Koechner) is the sports analyst and almost a `much too close' friend of Ron's. Then there is Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) who is the weatherman and, well, lets just say `not so smart' guy of the group. They are kings of the news in San Diego, until a Veronica Cornerstone (Christina Applegate) shows up. As Veronica is trying to work her way into the camera lens, the boys are trying to keep her out. They are doing quite well, until one day when Ron has a freak accident, which lets Veronica have center stage.

The first time I saw this was with two of my best friends when I was driving through Texas and stopped for a few days of having fun in San Antonio. For most of the first half of the movie, I was barely laughing, and almost not enjoying the movie. And then about 35% to 50% into the movie, it clicked. I started to get the humor. And then the movie became hysterical. I was in tears on some parts. Now after the DVD came out, I even loved the movie more. From beginning to end, I find the whole movie hilarious. I honestly can understand why some might really hate this movie. The jokes can be very dumb at times. But once you find the humor in how the jokes are delivered, it becomes golden. The things I find myself laughing at the most are how the lines are delivered, or how some of the words are annunciated. The over the top acting also helps out a lot. It's just VERY silly. The improv lines are great also. When Ron and Veronica are smiling on camera and talking, the sound is muted for the audience in the movie while the credits role, but we as the viewers get to hear them hate on each other such as Ron saying ""I'm going to hit you right in the baby maker, yep, right in the ovaries"". The movie has a slew of cameos from some very funny actors as well. Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and even Seth Rogen (not a funny part at all really, but it's funny seeing him just be a plain old camera man with like 2 lines).

In the end, if you love this kind of silly comedy, then definitely own this. It never gets old.

P.S. - I own the double disk feature, and have yet to watch ""the adventures of Ron Burgundy continue"" feature yet. It's supposedly a ton of extra stuff they cut out from the movie. Enough to make a completely different movie. I fast forwarded through it enough to see there is like a bank heist and everything. So I'll give it a look-see sometime soon once I get the urge to watch some more Ron Burgundy. Then I'll just update my review with its review.",1238457600,,2869,4.2413162705667276

I finally got around to watching the film with commentary and it was a really fun ride. Rarely is the film itself discussed, instead questions about which cuss words/phrases will be ""bleeped"" out and random visits from unrelated celebrities fill the time.

The biggest laughs come from the visit of a ""bitter"" Dave Koechner who rants about how he was cut out of the film and wants to re-edit it himself since he is now reduced to selling shoes on the side of the road with his children.  It was almost more enjoyable than the entire movie and literally had me crying.

1541640,5,B00005JMYI,"Anchorman is a film that only comes around once every decade or so and it sets the standard for any comedies to follow. Arguably being Will Ferrells best it's a film with very ridiculous comedy moments brought together in an extremely intelligent way. It's not something where the jokes are reeled off one by one in an in obvious way, in fact some of the more funny jokes you can miss the first time round as they're very subtle. Along with Will Ferrell this film has a very strong supporting cast with people like Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and Christina Applegate. They give us a great blend of serious acting with very, very silly humour. I'm not usually a fan of the silly comedy movies and I'm sure a lot of people will shy away from it because it looks just that, however, it's something that will surpass all expectations and then some.

Anchorman tells the story of 1970s San Diego news Anchor Ron Burgundy and his time as the most respected Anchorman in the San Diego area. Him and his team, Brian Fantana (Rudd), Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) & Champ Kind (David Koechner) are brought into peril when an aspiring woman Anchor is brought into the team. Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) is brought into the news office due to complaints of lack of diversity. This woman is strong and no matter how hard the main news team will try, she's not going to be put off from her goal to be Anchorwoman. Ron manages to use his charm and his ability to play the Jazz Flute (No Inuendo intended) to win over Veronica and they end up dating. She wants to keep it quiet because it will peril her career, but Ron being a mans man tells San Diego live on air that they're sleeping together. Through another series of unfortunate events Ron Burgundys dog baxter is killed leading to him being late for newscast. Seizing her chance, Veronica takes charge and becomes Anchorwoman for the one show to the dismay of Ron. Because she was so successful she is promoted to co-anchor and the relationship is off.

I'm tempted to tell you the entire story but I wont. It is awesome though and is one of the most bizarre, childish and intelligent comedies I've ever seen. People would try to knock this film slightly by saying it's not as funny as his prior film, Old School but it's definitely much much funnier. The over the top acting of Ferrell is worth it alone as I could watch him in his outrageous emotional state after Baxter was killed, all day. Steve Carell is also another shining light in the film as he plays the dumb weather guy who's the over the top idiot that comes out with hysterically stupid things. ""I stabbed a guy in the heart"" the way he said it has to be witnessed as it's just classic Carell.

One of my favourite lines from the movie which occurred in the opening credits as it was just so unexpected and very very silly. ""The human torch was denied a bank loan"" is an absolute classic which I think many people will agree with. Also the fight between the different channels news teams is also a classic as it features cameos from one of the greatest comic actors in Ben Stiller as the Spanish language news Anchor. I could honestly go on and on about how crazily funny this film is but I would give everything away. All I can say to wrap this up is you will need to watch it more than once in order to catch all the jokes as some you will miss the first time around.",1227398400,5,3384,4.428571428571429
1541716,5,B00005JMYI,"This flick pertains to it being 1975 in San Diego about a famous and successful anchorman Ron Burgundy(Will Ferrell) who works alongside his pals on the news-team such as fashion-oriented lead field reporter Brian Fantana(Paul Rudd), sportscaster Champion ""Champ"" Kind(Dave Koechner), mentally retarded chief meteorologist Brick Tamland(Steve Carrell), and female newsreporter from Asheville, North Carolina Veronica Corningstone(Christina Applegate)who has been forced to hire as Ron's co-anchor.

I liked this movie so much, MARRIED WITH CHILDREN's Christina Applegate was sexy as usual and better looking and the most talented I have ever seen her throughout her whole acting career and I think Christina Applegate did an astonishing performance in this movie as well, not to mention she was definetly eyecandy in this movie.

I also enjoyed all the oldies songs they played from the 70's like ""Use Me"" by Bill Withers, ""Who's That Lady"" by The Isley Bros., etc., plus I enjoyed all the outtakes they showed us at the end of ANCHORMAN as well, which were quite a crack-up.

This movie also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had in 2003-2004 when George Bush, Jr. was still president and Senator John Kerry was running against Bush during this movies theatrical release in the Summer of 2004.

It is the ONLY Will Ferrell film I like where he is the lead character.

Now of course EVERY ear he does a similar film like all the sports films basketball, NASCAR & ice skating where this good Anchorman idea keeps being repeated.

The cast were perfect in their roles.  Did NOT need Luke Wilson though.  Unnecessary.  And, I do NOT like the Wilson brothers.

Now, the DVD package it's.

1541805,4,B00005JMYI,"Anchorman is the story of Ron Burgundy and his legacy as an anchorman on the channel 4 news time that frequents the number one spot in the ratings. His news team includes the sports newscaster, Champ Kind, the investigative reporter, Brian Fantana, and the weatherman, Brick Tamland. In this era of newscasting, only men were allowed to read the news. So what'll happen when Veronica Corningstone enters the picture? A woman who has the experience and the dream of becoming a network anchor. Will that dream come true? As Bob Dylan said, ""the times they are a'changin'."" Anything can happen and it's something you're going to have to deal with.

Reviewing Anchorman is more difficult than it looks. While it's one of my favorite movies, it's so incredibly random. There is a plot, but it takes a backseat to the memorable and hysterical one-liners from the film that had to be improvised at times. With a movie that's this spontaneous, it's a bit hard to comment on things like the story since it's kind of minimal in a movie like this. The actors who make up the channel four news team portray these characters pretty flawlessly in the film though. They're pretty absorbed in these roles and that's a good thing. It makes this ridiculous movie somewhat believable.

Now I've been a Will Ferrell fan for quite awhile now. He's made some pretty hilarious movies in his career, but this one was the last comedy he did that I really enjoyed. Every comedy he's done after this followed the same kind of formula; little plot and a lot of random one-liners and jokes that seemed to come out nowhere. It's funny the first time around and decent the second time, but after that it gets really redundant. People may find that flaw with this film, but I personally enjoyed it. The movie has almost a cult status for its ridiculousness alone. It's not only a film that continued my appreciation for Will Ferrell, but made me a fan of Paul Rudd as well.

Anchorman isn't really a movie for everyone. If you're looking for a film that has a good story, a lot of character development, or a steady buildup towards anything worthwhile then this isn't the movie for you. This is the type of movie that is designed just to make you laugh. You're not really supposed to think about what's happening or why it's happening. You're just supposed to have fun with it and enjoy the moment at hand. If you can follow something like Family Guy and laugh at the humor in that, then you shouldn't have a problem with Anchorman. You'll enjoy the comedy for what it is and like it says in the narration at the beginning of the film, you'll probably wind up thinking...one anchorman was more man then the rest. His name was Ron Burgundy. He was like a god walking amongst mere mortals. He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo. In other words, Ron Burgundy was the balls.",1208563200,2,2901,4.575

Too obvious for an adult. It reminds me of Late Night with David Letterman. He has a brain-fart & it falls falt. He thinks it will become funny if he repeats it three or four times, then explains the joke. No. Only his fool, Paul Schaefer laughs. Anchorman gives you escapist fare & you'll find yourself predicting what will happen next. Will Farrell sharpened his acting skills since then, but not much. The gang fight with all the local news teams is the funniest scene. That's about it.",1205712000,,662,4.434426229508197
1541807,4,B00005JMYI,"You know you're heading for a good movie when you get the first giggle at the very start. Right at the very start. Before the movie starts.

I normally would go out of my way to avoid a movie that not only features Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Steve Carell etc. The latest Hollywood Rat Pack. Sometimes they can be good in movies (Shallow Hal), but mostly, they think they're funny.

This has to be the first movie where they ARE funny. I was initially expecting a movie that was totally sexist. While it is totally sexist, it's cringeworthy (the outfits, the BAD hair, the facial hair), and funny (Baxter talking to Ron among others), and it's superior to all the other movies that feature the main stars. I can't really comment on Will Ferrell, I've only previously seen him in Old School (I think), and don't remember being that fussed about that film. It was something to pass the time.

Unfortunately, the Christina Applegate character is a role any actress could have played. How many actresses could have got away with it though? She manages to pull off a previously stupid sounding role, and make it her own, and make it work against Will Ferrell.

Anchorman is a story about the seventies. And I'm not just talking about bad hair, bad clothes, bad facial hair, bad music. It's a man's world. Women belong in the kitchen, tending to their husband's every need, making babies, while he goes out and earns the money, and eyes up the pretty girls, and regrets getting married. More specifically, it's about a woman, trying to break her way into being the first female anchorwoman on TV news. It was a very man's world apparently. But the lead male anchorman has some fatal flaws, apart from his looks - he falls for a pretty girl in a skirt, he reads ANYTHING on the teleprompter (heaven forbid, don't put a question mark at the end of a sentence that doesn't require one). The rest of his supporting anchorman include sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner), feature story guy Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and weatherman Brick Tamland (Steven Carell). They yet again manage to hold their own against Will's character, Ron, and pull off memorable performances, especially Steve LOUD NOISES Carell.

Full of funny situations, hilarious lines, funny outfits, and deliberate OTT acting, Anchorman is a film I would have normally avoided, and I totally expected to do an entirely different review. Excellent movie.",1205193600,7,2424,4.803357314148681

But my girlfriend and I kept throwing lines from the film at one another for weeks afterwards and cracking each other up. (I should have known then).
A few years later I caught it again on cable and ended up on the floor.  This movie was the impetus for a new rule in my life.  I now give almost all comedies (at least ones with a cast like this one) a second chance.  Sometimes your mood changes things so dramatically.
This movie is so chocked full of priceless lines it's ridiculous.  Others have gone on about them in detail, so I won't bother.  But just thinking about this movie makes me laugh.

1541811,1,B00005JMYI,"Some films are so bad they're good and their perpetrators usually excuse themselves by explaining that originality was the furthest thing from their minds. And occasionally we feel affection for them because, if nothing else, they evoke feelings of nostalgia for a supposed `golden age' when imagination and creativity were almost commonplace and the bottom line. However, don't be fooled into thinking that because you found Dodgeball, Meet the Fockers, Happy Gilmour, etc. funny you'll respond similarly to this.

Having dutifully sat through ninety minutes (it was a gift) of utter cringe-inducing garbage I can't help but wonder whether Ferrell will ever be trusted with money again. There is supposed to be a joke hiding somewhere in this film but obviously I blinked at the wrong time. If you have the sense of humour of an emotionally retarded orang-utan you might just enjoy it but be sure not to blink!

The one remotely saving feature is the performance of Christina Applegate as Ferrell's `love interest' who, at least, tries to invest her role with some degree of integrity. Oh, and you might derive some `enjoyment' along the way by trying to guess from which superior efforts this travesty has stolen; The Day Today, and 1987's Switching Channels, being merely the most obvious.

However there is one thing about this movie that utterly drives me crazy and this bothers me enough to not give this one a perfect 5 star rating.

The menu design is lazy and a complete step back to the bare bone DVD days.

I expect basic HD DVD functionality with my menu. I want to be able to access the special features from the pop up menu (the menu that appears while the movie is playing) and not have to stop the movie and then go back to the main menu because the pop up menu has omitted this feature (when every other HD DVD has not). Not acceptable.

I do expect a visually pleasing main menu with video clips playing under the menu, accompanied by a soundtrack - Like every other HD DVD. A static image with no music does not cut it.

This no frills, user not friendly menu is a huge negative. I hope Dreamworks does not tread this water any further. I wrongly assumed a quality standard had been set by the other studios. This is a step in the wrong direction for menu design.",1196467200,10,1157,4.221719457013575

1541893,2,B00005JMYI,"I recently saw ""Stranger Than Fiction"" and became enamored with Farrell's acting. As someone who never watched ""Saturday Night Live,"" I was not entirely certain what to expect. So, I began trudging backwards. I watched ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" and was struck by its light-hearted silliness. It has a sort of playful charm that most people can easily appreciate. But then I bought ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" and was shocked by the clumsy writing, delivery, and structure.

The writing and delivery is excruciatingly awkward (and not in an ""ironic"" way). It is every ""bad"" joke you have ever heard ... and that would have been fine, if only the writers/director gave them a fresh spin. Unfortunately, that did not happen. And while there are some ""bad"" films which have tremendous moments of greatness ... this is not one of those. The ""jazz flute"" bit is amusing, but not enough negate the film's very deep flaws. While I expected a ""surface"" film (one devoid of meaning but rich in fun), I did not expect this lack of technical sophistication. One such issue resides with the multiple narrators. While a third-person narrator initially lends the work a ""mockumentary"" feel, the audience then receives a series of first-person narrations ... how exactly does that work? (And, no ""suspension of disbelief"" is not the problem here ... it is a serious logical error).

I maintain that this work is representative of Farrell's unpolished side (perhaps his ""Saturday Night Live"" side). Still, this provides a basis for examining Farrell's newer works. It is amazing to see the progress this actor has made stylistically and technically over the past four years. It is wonderful to note Farrell can now create both mature art (like ""Stranger than Fiction"") AND spirited comedies that reach a wide audience (like ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby""). I look forward to Farrell's future films and hope that he continues to demand excellence from both him and his creative team.",1190678400,2,2012,5.020958083832335
1541894,5,B00005JMYI,"In the 1970's, the television news scene was a man's world, and the local news anchor was king! In San Diego, that king was Ron Burgundy, a ladies' man, man's man, man about town. Ron loved his city, and his city loved him. This all changed when the first female anchor came onto the scene. When Ron met Veronica Corningstone, it was love at first sight, but his male-chauvinist, co-worker pals, Champ Kind of Sports, on-the-scene reporter Brian Fantana, and mentally challenged weatherman Brick, weren't ready to give up their friend, or their newsroom, without a fight. When Ron and Veronica's fledgling relationship suddenly goes sour as a result of her promotion to a lead anchor, the boys are happy again to have Ron back as their leader, until Veronica exacts her revenge and turns the entire city against him!

While his best film thus far would have to be the charming, stylish, instant Christmas classic ""Elf,"" ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" may always be considered the quintessential Will Ferrell comedy. Hilariously silly 99.9% of the time and recapturing the tackiness of the '70s throughout, if you love comedy and Will Ferrell, this film is a must have. The ensemble cast features some of the best comedic actors of the 21st century in both major and minor roles, from Steve Carell as Brick Tamland to Fred Willard as newsroom chief Ed Harkin; from Christina Applegate as Veronica Corningstone to Jack Black as a very angry biker! The humor is random and unpredictable, the performances are spot on, the ""Afternoon Delight"" scene is unforgettably funny, and yes, there's a story too. Good stuff all around!

The Unrated, Widescreen DVD doesn't disappoint much in the extras department either. Granted, the DVD commentary is mostly a waste of time. It's basically just Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay cracking wise about everything BUT the movie, which they hardly even talk about, along with some other cast members (a few simply call in) and some completely unrelated guests. The commentary is wacky, but while I usually love Will Ferrell's comedic antics, it's mostly not as funny as it tries to be. There's a ton of other stuff too though. We get a Ron Burgundy interview with Rebecca Romijn Stamos from MTV, a wealth of deleted scenes and outtakes, a hilarious ""Afternoon Delight"" music video, an interview with Ron, a making-of featurette, an ESPN audition, and a ton of text bios and production notes!

His 1970s Heston is accurate right down to the cheesy hairstyle/mustache, turtleneck sweater, polyester jacket, stage-emotive speech patterns, and agonized, toothy, jaw-stretching facial contortions to display intensity of emotion (the grieving bit in the phone booth after his pet mutt has been pitched off a bridge had me rolling off the couch...it was pure, scenery-chewing 70s heavy-heavy Heston).

1541902,5,B00005JMYI,"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

Released on July 9, 2004

Written by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay

Directed by Adam McKay

Anchorman is a very funny movie, but it is inconsistent in tone. They do anything for a laugh, and ad libbing was encouraged by director Adam McKay, but it often veers off track, and the story is pretty stupid. It just doesn't make sense, half the time. That being said, it has some of the funniest scenes ever filmed, and I'm sure there were a lot of laughs, on screen and off.

It begins with the following narration, spoken by announcer Bill Lawson: ""There was a time, a time before cable. When the local anchorman reigned supreme. When people believed everything they heard on TV. This was an age when only men were allowed to read the news. And in San Diego, one anchorman was more man then the rest. His name was Ron Burgundy. He was like a god walking amongst mere mortals. He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo. In other words, Ron Burgundy was the balls.""

There is the movie in a nutshell. It is very funny in spurts, but spins out of control just as often. The problem is that the funniest parts could also be the out of control ones. Will Ferrell is excellent as Ron Burgundy, all empty headed and puffed up with self importance. There are great scenes of the news team doing the purposeful walk, wearing 70s style suits, it is so right on and true to the period.

Another problem is the theme of a woman breaking into the male dominated world of TV News. It tries to be too PC, and that gets in the way of the comedy. Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) doesn't know if she wants to play it as a professional or a conniving slattern. Does she loath Ron Burgundy or love him? If she is as intelligent as she appears, then how could she love someone as ignorant as Burgundy? Should the movie mock her, or should it just mock Ron and the other male chauvinists?

I like the part where Ron Burgundy comes home and talks to his dog, Baxter. Also outstanding was the scene where Ron Burgundy jams at a jazz club with his flute. There is a running gag where the other news teams rumble, and one of them gets his arm ripped off. Later, when everyone is trying to cover the Panda being born at the San Diego Zoo, he is shown with one arm. I just wish they could have shown as much care for the other plot lines that led nowhere.

I want to emphasize that I think this is a very funny movie, and I recommend it, but it gets silly at times. There are some very funny people in it. Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Steve Carrell, Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Fred Armisen, Vince Vaughn, Fred Willard, Owen Wilson, and Chris Parnell, as well as co-anchors Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate. Four of them have double L's in their names.

I actually did not see Anchorman in the theaters, passing it by, thinking it was just one of those stupid crude, anti-women movies that focus all on sexual humor. Well two years later my friend sat me down in front of the TV on a rainy afternoon and we watched Anchorman on HBO. I was immensely surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It's that type of humor you have to understand to like--humor you find in movies such as Nacho Libre and Dumb and Dumber. You have to sit down and watch it with a complete open mind, because if you're expecting some genius great comedy movie, prepare yourself for a huge disappointment. I wasn't expecting a great comedy movie, and the humor is that stupid humor that makes you laugh harder than a solid, real comedy film. The acting is both great and hilarious with a side-splittingly hysterical role by Steve Carell and smart, classy roles by Ferrell and Applegate. It even features a hell of a lot of celebrity cameos, including Jack Black and Luke Wilson. And the best part about this movie? It gets FUNNIER AND FUNNIER every time you see it, until the point where you helplessly burst out laughing when you see the DVD on a shelf in Blockbuster. And then there's no turning back.

But if you like that sort of thing, then you will absolutely love this film. I did.

Pairing David Koechner, Steve Carell and Will Ferrell made a great cast, plus the addition of many other fine actors, although I myself don't really care for Fred Armisen. Later on, Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins appear in the Battle of the Newsteams, which is one of the high points of the film. Brick Tamland (Carell) and his absolute stupidity are hilarious, like the times when he is, out of no where, just holding a grenade, when he says the most idiotic things like ""I love lamp"" and ""I'm Brian Fantana"", and when he kills the ""guy with a trident.""

I personally believe that the dialogue and the ""Afternoon Delight"" song are what made this film. To hear Will Ferrell's take on what ""San Diego"" means is highly amusing. I love everything about this film, honestly. Ferrell's rendition of ""Aqualung"" by J-Tull was also pretty nice.

Will Ferrell leads the new generation of comedy stars in this goofball 'story' about the trials and tribulations of San Diego's top TV anchorman, Ron Burgundy and his trio of screwy sidekicks (played absolutely brilliantly by Paul Rudd, David Koechener and Steve Carell). Vince Vaughan, Ben Stiller, Jack Black and even Tim Robbins provide support with inspired cameo performances. Even the talking dog, a dubious concept at the best of times, works without inducing a vom-a-thon.  The casting is inspired: Christina Applegate brings her sympathetic screen presence to the role as ambitious anchorlady and love interest Veronica Corningstone, while Fred Willard (who has impeccable timing) is a blast as Ed Harkin the station boss. In fact there are no weak points to speak of, just several standout moments: Ron breaking down in a telephone booth is a classic, as is Veronica throwing a typewriter at his head.

Even the music is spot on: the wonderfully corny 70s classic Afternoon Delight makes a welcome screen comeback and puts the icing on the cake. Superb.",1163462400,3,1284,5.168269230769231

This movie literally made me feel stupid- but not so stupid as to continue watching it past about half an hour.  The part I did see, however, made me think of movies in which Will Ferrell was actually funny- movies like Elf, my personal favorite from Ferrell, or more recently Talladega Nights: The Story of Ricky Bobby.

1542103,4,B00005JMYI,"I personally feel that Will Ferrell is one of the funniest men alive.  He makes everything he touches hysterical and worth watching, to me at least.  I do know those who can't stand him...those people I am not friends with...HA.  Anyways, so that said I couldn't believe it took me so long to see `Anchorman' but it was just one of those movies that slipped through the cracks for me, despite the fact that all my friends kept insisting I watch it.  So, after watching `Talladega Nights' I just knew I had to see `Anchorman' ASAP.

While I don't feel it's as much a riot as `Talladega Nights', `Anchorman' still holds my attention and induces quite a few belly laughs.  The whole idea of Ron Burgandy (Ferrell) fighting to keep his position as the favored anchorman after the hot young thing Veronica Corningstone (Applegate truly holding her own against this hilarious cast) comes into the station and threatens to steal his thunder.  Aided by his all male posse, including Paul Rudd, David Koechner (gets a bit obnoxious and annoying at times) and the hilarious Steve Carell, Ron does his best to distress Veronica in an attempt to get her fired and or to quit.

The whole erection scene (sorry, I had to bring it up) while at first had me thinking ""not again, does every comedy have to do this"" really turned out to be one of the funniest scenes in the film...that whole ""It's an optical illusion"" line was brilliant.  I've only seen the unrated version so I'm not sure what all is different so if I mention a scene that you haven't seen or that you don't see after renting it then I'm sorry...must not be on the theatrical version.  Just look for the Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Tim Robbins cameo scene...it's outrageous, unrealistic and brilliantly hysterical.

Anchorman has a plot, but does anyone care?  It's mostly about Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) playing a 70s overconfident anchorman whose macho buddy-verse consisting of Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell), and Champ Kind (David Koechner) is disrupted by the promotion of Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) into their news ranks.  Mostly.

Anchorman is all over the place.  It pokes fun at news shows, like how they all hate each other like 50s gangs (and imagines them duking it out with bats in alleys).  It jokes about how the intelligence requirements to become a weatherman (Brick has an IQ of 48 and is ""what some people call mentally retarded."") It mocks 70s fashion (Look at those shoes! That moustache! Those slacks!).  It painfully wrangles with the struggle of equality in the workplace.  Sometimes it's about the love between a man and a woman...and sometimes it's about the love between a man and his dog.

Anchorman's a lot of things, not all of them funny.  In fact, Carrell is far funnier than Ferrell, and he has a lot less lines.  Ferrell infuses Burgundy with a vague accent that he drops in and out of.  He says all his lines like a kid play-acting in front of his high school class.  Being funny takes a lot of work, but it shouldn't look like it: Ferrell seems constipated for most of the movie.  That leaves poor Applegate to shoulder the burden, bless her heart...but she's the straightwoman, so there's not a lot she can do to help.

It's hard to say a comedy is bad. Just about every movie can be funny, even unintentionally, and a judgment on quality humor is extremely subjective. I have to be honest, though: Anchorman feels lazy.  It doesn't really have a plot, the acting is terrible, and most of the jokes are beaten to brutal, bloody deaths.  I mean, jazz flute is funny and all, but after awhile you need to put the flute down and tell a joke or something.  The ending doesn't even make any sense (and it's clear, after watching what was cut, that they cut a major plot point).

I love Carrell though.  His lines alone make the film worth watching.  And now that I've seen it...

Former SNL star turn superstar Ferrell has made a name for himself as the comedic willing to go the extra mile for another slapstick joke- Anchorman- written and I believed produced by Ferrell is no differant.

Ever absurd incident is hillarous and although the movie itself is absurdity of situations from Ferrell playing the jazz flute, to having his dog drop-kicked off the side of a bridge because of an anger motorist, to having an all out battle between all the news stations involving a man on being on fire and a grenade... Ferrell's amazing absurdity of events seem to work to create a movie that my ten year-old brother and I LOVE to watch...It's the perfect choice on family movie night for us because both the kids and adults seem to enjoy it together...

It's movie about a time when everyone believed what they heard on TV and only men where allowed to read the news. Arrogant and over the top Ron Burgandy(Will Ferrell) the man about town is suddenly threatened when Veronica Cornerstone(Christina Applegate) takes the position as co-anchor. The two mutual hate eachother- Ron who reads anything off the telepromter is uncermoniasly fired when Veronica puts ""Go F*** yourself San Diego"" during a broadcast. Ron's life halts and with a absurd amount of ridicolous issues the story ends with a ""life-changing"" happy ending.

Some will adore its comic irreverence, and some will quite frankly 'not get it'. To me personally this is my favourite comedy of all time, and quite possibly my favourite film in general. I will attempt to not use any of the classic quotations from this film as it will spoil the brilliance of hearing them for the first time.

The story is set in a sexist news studio in San Diego, America. The lead anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) falls for a woman at a party, and she incredibly, to Ron, rejects his not so subtle advances. The next day that very woman, Veronica Corningstone is appointed as a journalist in their very newsroom. Cue brilliant pick-up attempts, witty one liners, emotional breakdowns and scenes that don't leave the mind for weeks. Brick is the lovable fool, who interrupts with odd - yet hilarious - lines at random parts of the movie, he is the weatherman. The sports commentator Champ Kind, is a more roguish persona, who suffers a mental breakdown after Ron decides to go on a date with Veronica instead of attending their monthly pancake breakfast. Yes it's that irrelevant. Bryan Fantana is the 'man on the scene' and is the typical ladies man. All the acting in this film deserves to be noted, they all convey the different personalities of the charchters superbly and somehow without laughing.

All in all I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone with an irrelevant humour or in need of something up-lifting, which this film oddly fulfils. A cult classic in the form of Zoolander. Do watch out for the battle scene and a cameo from Jack Black. Pure comic brilliance.",1151193600,2,1745,4.644012944983818

1542257,5,B00005JMYI,"In the book, there were a lot of subtle details that the author included. They all had a reason. For instance, Vivian and Morgaine, both of fairy ancestry, should be shorter than most people, not taller, as with the movie. Also, the women of Avalon, when riding abroad, wear men's breeches. There's a reason for this. Morgause is not an evil sorceress. Neither is Mordred an evil person. The term Merlin is a title, not a name. The priestesses of Avalon do not dress in gaily colored clothes. The sacred well is actually sacred, and not to be treated like some weathered magical artifact. There are numerous other details, others not so subtle that have either been altered or cut out altogether.

I agree with a previous poster about how the true victims were the actors and actresses of this movie. The scriptwriter probably had to acquiese to either the producer, director, or studio managmenet. How else could any writer, novice or professional, think to leave out or change some of the most important parts of the story? Nothing worked. Not the love between Igraine and Uther. Not the love between Lancelot and Guenivere. Not Arthur's love for Guinevere and his companions. Not Morgaine's love for Lancelot. Not Viviane's commitment to the Goddess. Not the Merlin's or Raven's devotion. Not the sanctity of the Beltane rites. Not the sacredness of Excalibur, of the Holy Regalia of Avalon. Not even Mordred's inner conflicts. He's not evil, only conflicted. Imagine being the son of the High King and not being acknowledged for it because some priests consider it heresy. Imagine the pain the High priestess of Avalon, the Lady of the Lake, had to endure in order to keep Avalon alive. The ""solo"" passage through the mists should have been the culmination and greatest test for any priestess. Lastly, who in their right mind would change the ending to any great book? That is the utmost in presumptuousness.

I am very dissappointed with this movie. Many points and details in the story have either been changed or altered. I do not blame any of the actors or actresses. They did their best for such a mediocre production. Like the Lord of the Rings, Marion Zimmer Bradley's adaptation of the Arthurian legends should have been broken up into three separate movies, each about three hours long. Maybe then can we all truly enjoy the story of The Mists of Avalon.

This movie was not The Mists of Avalon. It is a different story altogether. How I wish I hadn't seen this under the pretext of MZB's book. If you truly want to enjoy this story, please read the book instead. This movie may have been made for TNT, but that doesn't excuse it's poor quality. We should never lower our expectations for any story. We should hold storytellers, print or film, to the highest standards. And we should never butcher a good story for the sake of corporate entities.

1542258,4,B00005JMYI,"Anchorman is a stupid movie but it works.  It doesn't pretend to be anything otherwise.  This was the perfect vehicle for Ferrell and wouldn't have worked without him.  As Ron Burgundy, he's a tacky, sexist, perverse, egomanic and it's hilarious.

For those who haven't seen it, Anchorman takes place in 1970's San Diego.  Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) heads a local news team who are worshipped like Gods by the public.  Their reign at the top is shaken when a woman is hired to work at the station.  Ron and his band try their hardest to force her to quit, but he begins to have feelings for her.  The rest you'll have to watch and find out.

The plot is pointless, but let me say that if you find Ferrell and his brand of comedy hilarious (NOT Bewitched), you will love him in this.  Fan's of Saturday Night Live will detect a bit of his Robert Goulet impression in Ron.  It's worth a look for the laughs even if it is pointless and stupid.",1149033600,,941,4.381502890173411

But, aside from a mangy dog that talks to him and shares his pillow at night, he is all alone.  Then Veronica, a pretty and determined feminist with big dreams, comes along and threatens to take away everything that makes his life so sweet - and possibly make it sweeter.

""Anchorman"" was a good movie.  It was mostly a spoof on love stories and everything relating to the news, but I found it to be amusing and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.  There was definitely some foul language and a few mature parts, hence it's PG-13 rating.  But I liked it.

1542260,3,B00005JMYI,"Stupid comedy is an art.

Like with any art, sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't.... On the top end of the stupid comedy scale, we have films like Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, the Wedding Singer, Spaceballs and Mystery Men. On the other end of the scale, we have all of the Rob Schneider movies and a few of the Pauly Shore ones. Dodgeball is closer to the bottom, There's Something About Mary is closer to the top.

Anchorman is right about in the middle. The humor works... sometimes... like the gangfight scene. That's pretty funny. But sometimes Anchorman falls flat, like the ""jazz flute"" sequence. The jazz flute bit is kind of lame.

People who don't usually like stupid comedy probably won't like Anchorman much at all; the humor relies on Ferrell's mugging and obnoxious overacting. Some of the casting is good, some misses the mark--Steve Carell is comedy gold, and usually Fred Willard is, too, but he looks a bit miscast in his role, here. The cameos are awesome, bringing in Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, Jack Black, Ben Stiller and others.

Overall, this is an inconsistent film. Some people are going to absolutely love it, others are going to hate it. Me? I was a little disappointed, but it's still an okay movie. It's not Ferrell's best work--he's better in Zoolander, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back and the Producers, for instance--but he does a fine job nonetheless.

On the other hand, maybe I'm just not the type of guy who enjoys farce that much. That would quite possibly put me in the category of an up-tight someone who needs to chill out.

In my opinion Will Ferrell is on top form in this film, and the film is soley based around his kind of humour. if you enjoyed his roles in Elf, Oldschool and Wedding Crashers youll love Anchorman. Christina Applegate plays the role of Ron's love interest well and brings some elements of humour with her. The majority of the humour is based around the ignorant and sexist attitudes of Ron and his news team, however there are also some goofball elements included such as the rivallary between various news teams.

I can't lie because I am a big Will Ferrell fan so I was very hype to see it when it came out so I went right to the theatres. I came out with a lot of anger and all I could say was it was horrible. After seeing it in the theatre for some reason I bought the DVD and now I can't stop watching it. See these types of movies need a tremendous amount of nothing to watch them. What I mean by nothing is you need no intelligence, thinking, or even concentration because everything in Anchorman is easy to get.

 It's hilarious but to people that actually watch movies like this or Napoleon Dynamite and every other movie like them while being in a smart mode they fail to see it for what it really is. That's the problem today, people are too concerned with everything but what's actually funny in the films and they get mad at them. You have to be laid back and relaxed for a movie like anchorman and most of all you need a huge goofy sense of humor. I leave you with this advice; movies like this are always better when you have a goofy buddy to watch them with. If you have someone that laughs with you at what would seem to be dumb situations things become a little more worth watching.

1542356,5,B00005JMYI,"Anchorman, the story of a man named Ron Burgundy, is a hilarious movie with a number of above average actors.

The movie starts off introducing you to the team.

Ron Burgundy, played by Will Ferrel, is a somewhat naive person with a decent personality. He loves a nice glass of scotch, cigarettes, poetry and most of all, his dog Baxter, a wise dog who can speak english and spanish, and is described as ""a miniature buddha, filled with hair"". Ron also is an expert flute player.

Brian Fantana, played by Paul Rudd, is a vain, sexist who has a way with woman.

Champ Kind, played by David Koechner, is a very stereotypical Texan who likes to have fun, and is known for his, somewhat annoying catchphrase, ""Whammy!"".

Brick Tamland, played by the hilarious Steve Carrell,is a very stupid person with a mental problem, and says random things, in some moments, and screams alot.

Wes Mantooth, played by Vince Vaughn, is the leader of another newscast who placed #2 in the ratings, and has an extreme hatred, but respect for Ron Burgundy.

And Veronica Corningstone, played by Christina Applegate, is a woman that makes the newscast go crazy for her, and each try poor pickup attempts on her, however Ron is the only one who succeeds.

She is intelligent, and a very good journalist.

Ron and Veronica have a great relationship, but it goes awry when Veronica finds out what he thinks about female anchors.

The story does a fantastic job of keeping you interseted, and has a huge number of big celebrity cameos. They include Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Fred Armisen, Jerry Minor, Seth Rogen, and Tim Robbins.

The good thing about this movie is that most comedies die down in ""funnyness"" at the end, but Anchorman keeps it the entire movie.

If your wondering about if it's okay to by the unrated version,  the difference is about 7 or 8 minutes of extra scenes, one where they say the F-word about 6 times. If this doesn't sound good to you, then try the theatre version. However it was a very funny movie that I will watch again and again.",1141430400,3,2050,4.629834254143646

1542360,5,B00005JMYI,"Will Ferrel is the man!  The role of Ron Burgundy suited him well.  And he capitalisized box-office-wise to great effect by assuming this 'anchorman of anchormen' lead.  Two Thumbs Up!  Way Up!  Hadn't laughed this hard since Tanya Harding used her Kerrigan knee-capper in a 'Colder Than Ice Cold' failed attempt at smut.  Christina Applegate did a fine job.  No, that's selling her short - she was titillatingly splendid.  Steve Carell's IQ may have escaped him in this flick, but it barely showed....oh alright, even the polar bear club would have demanded photo ID plus background check.  Very funny movie!  Ferrel drunk at the bar doing his best Ted Kasinsky drowning in a cesspool of his own frustration was a hoot.  Thanks to all involved with the film, for I can now in good faith point to my 'Pattern in the Pleats' as explanation for all misgivings/shortcomings.

A quick word on what it takes to emulate Ronald Burgundy's lavish workplace know-how:

If one owns many leather bound books, a next logical step would be 'Become local television news host/anchor.'  That's all it takes folks.  Books bounded by sweet/sweat scented leather - questionably recycled hooker boots and bum chaps shall not count on account of the smell-factor which cannot be discarded duefully nor outrightly - are your ticket to a rusted tinsle town.  Yes, at this stage you can earnestly make claim of possessing 'The Right Stuff' 'The Mack Skills' 'The Dim Wits of Reporter Tradition'.  Albeit critical acclaim/acknowledgement along the fine-lines of 'Big phony lacking belly laugh believability' and 'Such a Dullard the viewing audience can't help but contemplate belly laughing' is yet far off.  Needn't fret!  Those goods will come with the baggage - the hag seated next to you learned this lesson decades earlier dating your arrival when her rocky on-scene update covering the local brothel revealed an all too familiar name in the scandalous brouhaha's late 60's archives (here's inserted name of whomever your local coanchor happens to be - sexual status irrelevant).  And you thought their constant brooding on set week-in-week-out was senility in practice!  You see, Ron Burgundy took his notes on the fly, but from birth he surpassed you and I.  His books were leather bound.  Are yours?  Shouldn't they be?  Will you ever initiate jotting down post-birth guiding notes?  We can't all be Ron Burgundy at the anchor chair, but the sooner the better, trust me.  Paperback wasn't invented in his day - then again the cover's consistency didn't seem to hinder Ron's competency level one iota.  'Go Frick Yourselves San Diego' is prime evidence of just that.  C'mon future anchor persons, if you're gonna be so brash as to convince yourself of the futility of preparatory prime time area news greetings & salutations, well, please 'Go Frick Yourselves.'  I don't want my progeny staring bleary-eyed numbskullish at your drivel spewing robotically programmed remote controlled psychobabble frequented freakishly lip sticked yapper (is that lip stick I spot on two front yellow speckled teeth/mischisled dentures?) - especially when the little diablos could at the snap of my butler's fingers swiftly switch the channel and tune in to Ronny Boy Burgundy! - or the likes of his ilk.  I want my seed edumacated, NOT mentally emaciated via verbally lackluster 'And here's the news good people' fantasmagorical shoot-yourself-in-both-feet-put-yourself-in-a-stranglehold-pinch-your-brain-borefests!  Why can't you lie to me straightfaced?  Everybody else does.  Getting away with it isn't a grand challenge.  Ron Burgundy should serve as your prima donna anchor (man over board) archetype - follow not your heart but Ronald 'big lights' Burgundy in all sincere endeavor.  Fare thee well, he's a tough act to follow come suppertime story.  My notes are full.

In the case this has drawn laughs from anyone...I've a quick rap (condensed rendition)to lay down as a creme de le creme snack-on extra.  It's in deference to SNL's 'Lazy Sunday' track dished out feverishly by Chris Parnell and Andy Samberg, two dandy cast members.

Set in 1970s San Diego--trapped in Will Ferrell's ""deer in the headlights"" facial expression--ANCHORMAN gleefully basks in its irreverent male chauvinism, and makes no apologies along the way.

But I've already given more meaning to this flick than its intentions.  ANCHORMAN is pure, 110-proof nonsense--some of it priceless, most of it annoying cornball.  Ferrell plays a shallow, arrogant, dim, conceited, slow-witted, predictable simpleton of a TV news anchor who suddenly must conduct a sack check when his station hires. . .gasp. . .a female co-anchor!  Blonde, glorious Christina Applegate stars opposite Ferrell, and she comes across as bored and wooden in her role (although I felt wooden while watching her).  Yet the shining moments of this movie were captured by Ferrell's beloved ""news posse"":  a sports reporter (David Koechner); a roving news reporter (Paul Rudd); and a weatherman (Steve Carrell, who easily steals every scene he's in).  When these guys broke into a rendition of Seventies hit ""Afternoon Delight"" I thought my pair of Depends could hold back no more moisture as I laughed sans consequence.

Another plus:  ANCHORMAN boasts visits from several comedic actors in a plethora of cameos--Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, and Vince Vaughn, to name a few.  The news channel ""rumble"" amongst the various San Diego news personalities was simultaneously entertaining and irritating.  Which sums up this movie perfectly.

1542435,3,B00005JMYI,"Don't get me wrong, I liked Anchorman.  But not as much as wanted to.  The problem is, in a comedy your lead actor has to be the funniest person in it.  Farrell was a distant 5th, and that's only because I can't remember the bartender's name.

Steve Carell and Paul Rudd stole this movie handily.  Then Fred Willard, who has a knack for fantastic cameo roles, takes third.  Remember him in 'Best in Show', good stuff.  Then Christina Applegate out performs the lead.  Not the sign of a good comedy.

By the way, aren't we getting a little tired of Will Farrell yet?  And this may be a spoiler, but enough with Jack Black and Ben Stiller.  I think we have all seen enough of Black's lame karate poses on the red carpet at premiere night.

At once it was a laugh out loud, slap your mama funny movie and then it becomes this dull, worn out, drawn out and unfunny Saturday Night Live skit from the mid-90's.  In other words, when it is funny, it's very funny, but when it misses the mark, it misses by a good ol' country mile.

Will Ferrell goofs his way through this flick in sometimes funny, but mostly annoying, fashion.  Christina Applegate wasted herself here.  The ""newsteam"" that backed up Ferrell was boring.  I have to admit, though, that they captured the oafishness and all out idiotic mentality of most reporters.  I've worked with a few in my day when I was at a local station, and the majority of them aren't half as great as they think they are.  Their egos are bloated well beyond capacity.

The funniest parts of this film are when other stars make cameo appearances.  Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Wilson all have wonderful bit parts that result in hilarity.  The gem of the bunch has got to be Jack Black.  His burrito-induced road rage resulting in a punted pooch is classic.

I don't recommend purchasing this flick.  It's not silly enough to be considered ""brainless"" humor and it is entirely too idiotic to be intelligently funny.  However, the few gutbusters that are found here are worthy of at least one viewing.  Pick it up as a rental and then let fate take over from there.",1134086400,,1419,4.571428571428571

Will Farrell, Christina Applegate and all of the others do well in this film, but there just isn't that much to work with.

The high point of the film is when Ron plays his Jazz flute in the club, that part was hilarious and my favorite part of the film. Like I said, there are a few other highlights, Ron throws a burrito out the window and hits biker Jack Black, and like when one of Ron's co-workers wears his sex panther cologne that smells like ""a turd covered in burnt hair"" among other things. These parts are hilarious!

The soundtrack to the film is amazing; some of the best 70's music in one collection. Farrell and three other co-workers show off their singing ability by singing a version of ""Afternoon Delight"".

1542440,3,B00005JMYI,"Anchorman isn't much like the typical Hollywood comedy these days, but those who have seen enough of such comedies should realize that's definitely a good thing.  It's not quite a classic, but it's a silly, perverse, and occasionally surreal adult farce that effectively exploits the same formula that made Caddyshack a favorite among young guys everywhere: twisted characters, oddball dialogue, and a few lowbrow gags to keep everyone loose.  Even more importantly, it doesn't try too hard or wear out its welcome (having sat through Wedding Crashers in the theatre, I can attest that mainstream comedies shouldn't run past 100 minutes; this one clocks in at a highly palatable 90), and even the unrated DVD cut doesn't pile on gross-outs just because it can.  In other words, it's a lighthearted, funny, frequently inspired flick, which on its own makes Anchorman a success by the standards of the past few years.

Set in late 1970's San Diego, Anchorman scores some major points with its comedic take on the rapid social changes of the time and the inhernet vacuity of the news anchor's job.  The cast is surprisingly good, led by a brilliantly over-the-top performance from Ferrell (whom I could normally take or leave) in the lead role of Ron Burgundy and the constant scene-stealing of the great Steve Carrell as dim-witted weatherman Brick Tamland.  There are plenty of mock-serious poses to go around, and some hysterical physical comedy led by Ferrell's bizarre turn playing jazz flute (check out those flames!).  Hell, Ron Burgundy's mustache is a great running joke in and of itself.

The movie doesn't seem to have many aspirations beyond just being really goofy, but to be fair, it accomplishes that task extremely well most of the time.  Anchorman is at its best in its first half, when it revels in the excesses and political incorrectness of late '70's and pokes fun at them at the same time.  Not to mention, it's a goldline for memorable lines (in fact, Bill Simmons, aka the Sports Guy of [...] fame, used quotes from this movie for this year's NFL preview).  Here's a sampling of some of the classic lines from the first half-hour alone, not counting a few that I can't repeat:

""Years later, a doctor will tell me I have an IQ of 48 and I'm what some people call mentally retarded.""

""I'm very important...I have many leatherbound books...my apartment smells of mahogany...I'm friends with Merlin Olsen.""

""I could be wrong, but I believe diversity's an old, old wooden ship that was used during the Civil War era.""

""It is anchor MAN, not anchor LADY, and that's a scientific fact.""

""I will smash your face into a car windshield and then take your mother, Dorothy Mantooth, out for a nice seafood dinner and NEVER CALL HER AGAIN!""

""You know how to cut to the core of me, Baxter...you're so wise...you're like a miniature Buddha with hair.""

""I have very little time to get to the gym, so I have to sculpt my guns at the office.""

Unfortunately (even though I sort of saw it coming) Anchorman does lose a bit of steam after the halfway mark, although there are still some great bits of slapstick to be found: Jack Black's dog-punting cameo (an instantly memorable scene if ever there was one); the five-news team brawl, and the knock-down-drag-out fight between Ron and Veronica Corningstone chief among them.  Still, Anchorman manages to generate plenty of laughs and goodwill in its brief running time.  It's certainly not as nuanced and intelligent as, say, Sideways, but then I don't think it's supposed to be.  What it is supposed to be is a nice little piece of goofballery, which it very much winds up being.",1131667200,,3638,4.824476650563607
1542441,4,B00005JMYI,"After seeing such harch critiscm of Anchorman, my expectations of this comedy were mighty low. But it is exactly those low expectations that led me to enjoy this movie.

Sure...a lot of the jokes most any dunce could understand, but that's one of the points that makes Anchorman so enojyable and accesible. While it's not a comdey classic, it is a entertaining time to spend when you have a few hours to spare.

The plot focuses around the Channel 4 News studio and the hijinks that occur after a woman is hired as a correspondant. The leading News Anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is quickly smitten with the new newswoman. And hilarity ensues.

The character that produces the biggest laughs would have to be Brick, played by Steve Carrell. Will Ferrell deffinitly has his moments as well.

While a few of the jokes are lame and don't get across, most of it is simple, harmless, and fun. If you are looking for something with a little more depth, this probably is not for you. Though, if you are looking for a light movie to raise your spirits, this is worth a try.",1131148800,,1069,4.552083333333333

The story line is thin, to say the least, but there are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments.

This movie had a decent premise.  There is much to poke fun at about the seventies, but this movie didn't do it.  It seems as though nobody associated with this movie was trying very hard.

Somebody already mentioned the missed opportunity for a running gag about Ron reading whatever is on the teleprompter.  The scene where Corningstone and Burgandy trade insults over the credits, while very good initially, ran much too long and would have been more effective as a running gag.

At one point, there is a ""rumble"" between news teams of competing stations.  Initially, it was fun, but dragged on way too long.

There were perhaps half a dozen good scenes.  But, rather than write more good scenes, this movie chose to drag those half dozen out until they weren't funny anymore.",1125964800,7,795,4.786764705882353

1542556,3,B00005JMYI,"It occured to me after watching this film that Will Farrell is probably a great comedian because he says SO much that some of it is bound to be funny.  It is then up to his directors and editors to trim out what doesn't work and leave in the good parts.  For the most part, they succeed in Anchorman - the Legend of Ron Burgandy.  Both Farrell and his male castmates embody their stereotypical parts.  The actors bring enough new life to the stereotypes that we immediately recognise the characters, while still being able to surprise and entertain (rather than bore) us.  Christina Applegate has the unenviable task of being the ""straight man,"" but pulls it off and even gets some great comedic moments herself.  She is, I think, the key to making the film work - a central realism around which the waves of absurdity crash - much like Graham Chapman in the Monty Python movies.

No, I don't mean to say that Anchorman is a ground-breaking or paradigm-shifting film - it is not Monty Python, Airplane, or There's Something About Mary.  At best, it's a minor comedy, but there are more laughs in it than in the entire Adam Sandler catalogue.  Or, for that matter, in all of Will Ferrell's SNL skits (the Jeopardy parodies excepted, of course).  The story: The four stooges of Channel 4's news team - the top 6-o'clock news show in San Diego! - are threatened when the station manager chooses to hire a woman reporter.  Instead of the expected story arc - they try to make her life intolerable but she eventually wins them over with her pluck - we get a weird conglomeration (and, oddly, more realistic) of macho chest-thumping and competition over who can bed her.  It is not until she has the audacity to fill in for Ron as anchor when he is unavoidably detained by a littering incident that the animosity breaks out into full-scale gender war.

For someone to appreciate the film from a review like this normally requires quoting jokes.  The great thing about the jokes in this film is that the funniest ones are not one-liners appropriate for TV spots.  Instead, they are longer, situation-driven banter that builds.  When the film strays from this pattern into going for the cheap laugh (and, I suspect, ad libs), the film slows into inanity (like some of Farrell's other pictures e.g. Old School).

The director's comentary included on this ""unrated"" DVD version seems to confirm the point.  Because it is unrated, commentators Farrell and director McKay think it would be funny to see who can come up with the most offensive words to say to see if they get beeped.  That in itself might be a little funny or at least educational if there was some buildup.  Instead they go on for 10 minutes in a game of 1-upmanship that is not funny because they are, in fact, beeped, and because it goes on and on (and on and on..... you get the idea).  The other special features are more enjoyable, including some out-takes (but not too many of the type where the actors start laughing, thank goodness) and a long list of deleted and/or alternate scenes.  There are some interesting choices in there, and a discussion on why certain performances were used instead of others would have made an interesting DVD commentary.  Too bad we get the swear factory instead.",1125792000,,3256,4.653846153846154

""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" takes us back to those halcyon days of the 1970's, when the hair was as big as the lapels and women were just beginning to assume their rightful place in America's television newsrooms.

Will Ferrell plays a Ted Baxter-type anchorman (is it mere coincidence that his dog is named Baxter?) - vain, narcissistic, none too gifted in the brains department - who has worked for years as the sole news dispenser at a top-rated San Diego station.  All is going well for Ron Burgundy until the station manager decides the newscast needs a bit more ""diversity"" and hires a female reporter named Veronica Cornerstone (Christina Applegate) to come on board.  Cornerstone is a brainy, blow-dried blonde with a driving ambition to be the first female anchor on network news.  Since most of the men who work at the station, including Burgundy, are dyed-in-the-wool misogynists, Ms. Cornerstone faces an uphill battle of sexist comments, schoolboy pranks, and subtle (and not so subtle) undermining as she climbs her way to the top (though she is not above pulling a few dirty tricks herself to get what she wants).  Things really get dicey when Burgundy and Cornerstone begin dating and quickly fall in love, a situation rife with potential disaster as Cornerstone begins to encroach on Burgundy's professional territory.

""Anchorman"" is a light-hearted, enjoyable little comedy that, unlike a full-throated satire (say, like ""Network""), often goes for the easy laugh instead of the incisive barb.  The movie is at its best when it is parodying the corny graphics and the tendency to over hype the trivial (""Panda Watch: Day 46"") that define modern newscasts - and at its worst when it is indulging in silly, often scatological jokes and slapstick throw away bits.  Like most mainstream comedies, the humor in ""Anchorman"" ranges from the mildly funny to the downright hilarious, the latter including a clever ""West Side Story"" parody involving a rumble between rival news teams, and a conversation between a dog and a bear that ends the movie on a ludicrous but knee-slapping high note.

Ferrell (who co-wrote the film) is his usual manic self, unctuous but likable, and Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, David Koechner, and Fred Willard do fine work in supporting roles.  Moreover, writer/director Adam McKay provides a smattering of guest appearances from such well known stars as Jack Black, Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, Jerry Stiller and even Ben Stiller, many of who are not listed in the official credits.

""Anchorman"" goes down easily - a bit too easily, perhaps, for a film that, with a little more courage, might have become a scathing satire on an industry that could do with a little merciless skewering right about now.  Still, ""Anchorman"" is fun while it lasts - and these days we'll settle for what we can get when it comes to laughs.",1125705600,,2895,4.981327800829876

Vince Vaughn plays an opposing anchorman who hates him. Ron Burgundy's (Ferrel) crew consists of possibly the man who plays the funniest role in the film. ""Brick"" says the most stupidest things at the weirdest times in a dull eery manner and it is just incredibly funny. When ""Veronica Chapman"" comes to the news team, Ron and her fall in love and start a instant relationship. But when Ron throws a burrito out of his car window, everything changes, just like he states in the movie at that very part. Veronica takes his place as the main anchor that night and starts being more appreciated all over San Diego at that point on. Her and Ron break up and his life turns upside down. Until a sudden emrgency comes up and he's once again needed by his former boss. This movie is as funny as it gets. Not so much the center point.

The beginning of the film contains a warning saying that this is the uncut version and contains nudity, but honestly, there's no nudity in this film, and in fact, I didn't understand what made this film ""uncut"" at all -- there wasn't anything racier in this that you wouldn't find in any other ""R"" rated comedy.

Its open war between the sexes, a war which becomes even more heated when the unfortunate Veronica finds herself the sole object of adorations from the infatuated Ron Burgandy.

The main problem with the movie is that it is NOT FUNNY!  I was expecting to be in stitches as I am with most Will Ferrell comedy pieces but I don't think we genuinely laughed one time.  The movie was boring and at times gross (as they desperatly try for laughs by stooping to toilet humor which is gross but not funny).  I also usually love Vince Vaughn in his smart ass side kick rolls (see Old School!).  However, in this movie his part is small and his part has none of the wise ass humor I love from him.

As much as it pains me to say this, save your money (don't rent this movie and sure as heck don't BUY it)because you will probably feel cheated.  I am looking forward to when ""Bewitched"" comes out and hopefully they will have done better by Will Ferrell!",1119052800,6,1100,4.220095693779904
1542845,1,B00005JMYI,"Will Ferrell is great, but this was one of his worst projects by far! This movie was NOT FUNNY AT ALL!! I think I may have laughed ONCE through the whole thing.  I can't believe there are people out there that actually liked this pile of dung!  The storyline was brutal, the characters were extremely bad... I just don't get this film it's so stupid it's insane. This film was the biggest disappointment for me in my whole film watching career.",1118707200,8,444,4.469135802469136
1542846,5,B00005JMYI,"This movie is will Ferrell at his finest. From the opening credits he plays the bumbling anchorman known as Ron Burgundy in perfect form. When you buy this movie it will be for Will Ferrell's genius, he creates a character who is not simply a humorous idiot (that part is played by Steve Carell) but has motivation, sorrow, and even wit at times.  The dialog and writing on this movie is brilliant, the lines aren't ridiculously cheesy or over the top stupid for sake of being funny. By the same token it doesn't feel as if every line reads like it took a conglomeration of 10 minds 30 minutes to create it.
  Throughout it all Ferrell stays the man with below average IQ who is attempting to win his newfound love Veronica Corningstone and retain his job.
  Great cast, great writing, thank you Will Ferrell.",1118707200,12,809,4.551724137931035
1542847,3,B00005JMYI,"""Anchorman - The Legend of Ron Burgundy,"" may be an ""Adam McKay film,"" but this is Will Farrell's beast from start to finish.  Arguably the best performer ever on ""Saturday Night Live,"" Farrell has made a career out of bringing hilariously ridiculous characters alive.  Ron Burgundy is another such creation.

Set in the 1970's, in an America on the cusp of new ""fads"" like feminism, jogging, and environmental awareness, ""Anchorman"" charts the fall and redemption of Ron Burgundy, San Diego's top anchorman.  As the title character, Farrell brings his unique brand of hilarious sincerity to one of his most befuddled characters.  Ask yourself -- could any actor bring more to the line, ""San Diego, as everyone knows, was founded by Germans in 1904""?  If you love Will Farrell, you are sure to like, and quite possibly love ""Anchorman.""

Burgundy and his ""crack news team,"" which includes Paul Rudd as the horny roving reporter Brian Fontana and Steve Carell (""The Office"") as weatherman Brick Tamland -- and Carell plumbs the depths of how low the bar is set for weathermen in San Diego, rule San Diego's TV screens.  But trouble hits paradise when Burgundy's boss Ed Harkin (played by the always perfect Fred Willard -- although he's given surprisingly little to do) is instructed by ""corporate"" to bring on . . . gasp! . . . a woman!  Yes, feminism hits the newsroom in the beautiful form of Ms. Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate, proving that she is worthy of overcoming her ""Married With Children"" legacy).  Can Burgundy and his pals tolerate this desecration of the male bastion that is the newsroom?  How can Burgundy reconcile his professional pride with his raging lust for the delectable Ms. Corningstone?  Can Burgundy woo the resisting Ms. Corningstone with his fiery jazz flute performance?  Of such false drama is hilarious comedy made.

One can easily imagine Will Farrell and his buddies cranking this movie idea out over a long weekend of beer and pizza.  Many of the jokes are indeed inspired.  Look for some hilarious references to ""West Side Story"" as the news teams from different networks get together to ""rumble.""  Vince Vaughan leads the second-tier news team with comic timing that proves that ""Swingers"" was no fluke.  (From this insanely funny idea we get wonderful cameos from Luke Wilson as the anchor from the third-tier newsroom, from Tim Robbins as the anchor from PBS (of course), and from Ben Stiller as the anchor from the Spanish newschannel.  Genius!)  Who else could conjure up a cologne named ""Sex Panther"" that ""smells like pure gasoline""?  Who else could dream up a beloved pooch who wears a head-gear retainer to bed and speaks with bears?  The comic talent at work here is dazzling (look for another inspired cameo from Jack Black, by the way).

Still, at the end of the day, ""Anchorman"" leaves one unsatisfied.  Perhaps its because the movie is so darn short -- even the ""uncut, unrated"" version clocks in at barely over 90 minutes, and that's with filler.  True, a lean, mean comedy is better than a bloated gasbag, but this movie is so lean that it borders on emaciated.  Or perhaps it's because the cast of the movie is so darn good that the expectations can't be met.  Whatever the reason, ""Anchorman"" does not rise to the level of beloved comedies.

Full disclosure -- I was on the floor laughing when Vince Vaughan's character was introduced as ""Wes Mantooth,"" which is the name of one of my best childhood friends.  To hear that name attached to that character had me in stitches.

Another point -- this is the ""unrated uncut"" version of the movie, but unlike so many other comedies, ""unrated and uncut"" does not translate into ""more T&A.""  I am not a prude by any means, but too many ""comedies"" use nudity to cover up the fact that the movie just ain't that funny.  ""Anchorman"" is refreshingly nudity-free, choosing to go for real laughs rather than blatant titilation.  The language, while coarse, also generally refrains from profanity, with one funny exception.

Check out ""Anchorman"" for some huge, if isolated laughs.  I cannot say this is a ""must for the film library,"" but you should definitely see it.",1118620800,,4170,4.866666666666666
1542848,4,B00005JMYI,"After watching this film, I thought my ribs were cracked from laughing so hard. I really loved this movie, but I can't give it a perfect rating for a few reasons. First, Will Ferrell is SO annoying, I mean, he's not even funny most of the movie. Sure, there are some funny scenes he's involved in, but he just gets on my nerves most of the time. Secondly, there really is no plot that matters to this movie; it is a bunch of stuff that doesn't matter compiled into a movie. And there are situations where this movie has chances to do stuff and doesn't take advantage of their chance to make people laugh even harder.

However, there are so many reasons to love this film! Steve Carell does one heck of a job as retarded weatherman Brick Tamland. He steals the show and I found him, along with Paul Rudd as Brian Fantana, to be the funniest people in the movie. Carell is the guy with the belly laughs in this film, and if he wasn't in this movie it wouldn't be the same. There are so many memorable lines in this movie that I can't remember them all. And Christina Applegate does a good job as female anchor Veronica Corningstone.

Anyway, without Ferrell and using a better funnyman than him as Ron Burgundy, this movie would have been much better than it already is. Thats why I give it a 4, not a five.",1118534400,,1305,4.300813008130081

There work together in old school was above and beyond anything any of us could have hoped and prayed for. And now they take there comedic genius to anchorman. Which is not as funny as oldschool (what is) but is pretty damn funny in its own right. The movie is unbelievably funny all the way to the very end where I find it falls alittle short. But that does not take away from all the humor that came before the end. The movie is very entertaining and is definitly worth the purchase.

On an entertainment level, this film had the potential of being very funny.  It was very spotty as far as laughs.  However, the script comes off prety lame.  The acting was pretty obnixious and made it seem like I was going through a root canal at the dentist office.  Unfortunately, you'll be disappointed if you're expecting lots of laughs.

But for a measly $2 a rental around here, I figured I'd grab a bunch that I didn't wanna see, because the ones I really have wanted to see have been crap, and I figured the ones I didn't wanna watch would probably become new found favorites.

Well, this is by far NOT a new found favorite, but it was OK and seeing as how I was thinking it would probably be one I'd turn off after 30 minutes, it survived a whole screening from me.

The humor is a little weak through a lot of the movie, but some parts got me laughing.

Just a rental/wait for TV imo.

The high point is what Will says to San Deago that results in him getting fired. The low point is there is a small scene with Ben Stiller. I rolled my eyes and nearly puked, is there any non-stoner comedies made in the past few years that doesn't have him in it?",1117152000,,951,4.042553191489362

The parts that were funny, had me laughing until I couldn't breathe and the parts that didn't work had me looking at my watch waiting for them to move on. The basics are Will Ferrell plays a 70s era local news anchorman who is very popular and works and parties with his crew: weatherman, sports reporter and field reporter. Christina Applegate arrives as a beautiful young reporter trying to move in on what has been a male-only broadcast. This was a lot like a Monty Python movie in that it seemed more like a group of sketches loosely tied together to try to make a coherent movie. In this case when it works it's extremely funny and clever. But when it doesn't, it's just stupid.",1116979200,,742,4.503703703703704

Trouble is, she falls in love with Ron and their rivalry on-air ends up costing him his job. There are lots of funny moments, a lot at the expense of dimwitted weather guy Brick (Steve Carell from the Daily Show) and the big street throwdown with the different newcasters from the area (including Vince Vaughn as Ron Burgandy's rival, Ben Stiller as the Latin newsguy and Tim Robbins representin' PBS).",1116460800,,757,4.8307692307692305

Some lines in ""Anchorman"" had me spitting up wine, but dang if I could remember them later. The love story was moving, the sidekicks hysterical, and the setting in San Diego -- airhead/moronic anchorman capital of the world -- is sheer genius. Perhaps we should be sending ""Anchorman"" instead of Bibles around the globe to bring the finest of our culture to benighted heathens everywhere.

Lines like, ""I'm gonna punch you in the ovary, that's what I'm gonna do. A straight shot. Right to the babymaker."" or ""You have an absolutely breathtaking heinie. I mean, that thing is good. I want to be friends with it.""

1542937,4,B00005JMYI,"There is hardly a moment in this movie that does not make you laugh till' it hurts. Will Ferrell is Ron Burgundy, the #1 Anchorman in San Diego in the 1970's. He and his (absolutely histerical) channel 4 news team rule the city until a woman (Christina Applegate) is thrown into the mix, and begins to destroy the male-dominated news world.
This is one of the best SNL alumni movies of all time. It's really the first movie that allows Will Ferrell to let loose and show just how funny and talented he is. The entire rest of the cast, really stepped up to the plate to keep up with Will Ferrell, and was a perfect complment to the central figure Ron Burgandy.
Very little of the humor in this movie is crude, most of it relies on the talent of the cast to make you laugh. Anyone who has seen the movie would agree that the street fight between all of the city news teams, was one of the beat parts of the movie.

This is what a DVD should be: jam packed with bonus features, gag reels, promo spots, trailers, commentaries, and a music video. (The hilarious ""Afternoon Delight"" video will be stuck in your head for days).

However, the DVD commentary - yes, I do watch the commentaries after I have viewed the film - is exceptionally funny and better than the film. It is perhaps the best commentary of any film on DVD that I have encountered.

Why?  Because it is a non-stop improvised comedy routine that sends-up commentaries on DVD.  It's hilarious and even includes, unexplainably, Lou Rawls adding his two cents to the conversation.  There is a ""fist fight"" that leaves Ferrell wounded and bleeding and...well, you have to listen to it all.  They never do get around to describing the film...and hence, the joke.

Don't label me a fuddy-duddy for not falling for this garbage.  And obviously, when you make 1000 attempts at a joke, one or two of them will succeed on some level.

Most of Ferrell's comedy routines are no better than immature adolescent antics that are not at all funny and any man taken off the street can act better than he can. That being said, I do not understand how with his lack of abilities he is given the star role in this movie. I also find it ironic that Will Ferrell plays a news anchorman who is not willing to share his anchor desk with a newcomer newswoman, played superbly by Christina Applegate, and like the movie, Will Ferrell is apparently not willing to share the leading role in this movie with Christina Applegate. Applegate is way more funnier than Ferrell, and is a much better actor. This movie is really about her character's story, her struggle to make it as anchorwoman in a world not that long ago where women were not believed to be as smart as men. This movie should have devoted more time on Applegate's character, rather than filling dead time with Ferrell's stupid pranks and follies. I fail to see why the movie is centered around a no-talent like Will Ferrell whose character is not even pivotal in the plot and would have been more effective as a supporting role.

I kept expecting to laugh, looking for the jokes, waiting for it ... but nothing.  The only funny parts of the movie are the character of Brick Tamland (he just says random things, and I think they were all improvised) and the outtakes at the end.  There is one laugh regarding a prank the female newscaster plays on Ron Burgundy, but that was mostly for the shock value than actual humor content.  Jack Black comes into the movie long enough to drop-kick a dog off a bridge.  Um, okay?  Is that supposed to be funny?  I found it more disturbing than anything, and something Mr. Black should be above doing.  Oh, and there's a little dig at the Bush Administration at the end, but it was so unoriginal and unfunny as to almost be insulting.

The individual scenes and performances really shine and its those incredibly funny moments that make the movie worthwhile.  It also helps that the supporting cast does a great job.

1543268,4,B00005JMYI,"Ron Burgundy is a 1970s news anchor in San Diego, a lonely, unintelligent man who will read anything that is written on the teleprompter. In Anchorman, his world is invaded by an ambitious woman with dreams of her own for the anchor position, and Ron doesn't quite know how to react. On the one hand, he is helplessly drawn to her beauty, but on the other, he is threatened, as no woman has ever been a news anchor before, and Burgundy doesn't want to look like a softie to the other news teams in the city.

To analyze Anchorman as a film would be foolish, as it is a movie designed to entertain with laughs, not encourage deep thought. It succeeds in delivering the laughs, though I did take issue with some of the more over-the-top elements, which, while providing perhaps the biggest laughs in the movie - such as the news team rumble - were out of place with the rest of the film, which at times was a very effective satire of television news reporters.

Will Ferrell does a great job as Ron Burgundy in a winning comedic turn, and Christina Applegate proves to be a wonderful foil for him as Veronica Corningstone. There are a few surprise cameos that I will not reveal; some were funnier than others.

I've been known to say that I would be entertained by Will Ferrell dancing on screen with a broomstick for two hours. In Anchorman, Ferrell doesn't get that chance, but the movie is still entertaining enough to warrant a hearty recommendation. Anchorman takes a little bit of time to get rolling, and while it may not be the funniest movie out there, it's still a solid comedy.",1110153600,2,1586,4.5

1543270,3,B00005JMYI,"70s throwback movies seem to go through a minor vogue period last year - as well as 'Anchorman', 'Starsky and Hutch' made it big last summer. Will Farrell stars as Ron Burgundy - scotch loving, smooth haired, charming, big fish in a small pond newscaster in 1970s San Diego, loved by all with his catchprase 'Stay Classy San Diego'. He bestrides a ludicrous team of reporters such as the retarded weatherman Brick and sexist primal jackass reporter Brian. This absurd assembly is shattered by the arrival of the stereotypically glamorous Veronica Corningstone. Ron preposterously seduces her, despite her obvious intial misgivings and this upsets the boys culture around the newsroom. Things go badly wrong for Will after he accidently hits a moustacioed biker with a burrito, leading ultimately to Veronica taking over as chief anchor.

The movie is, primarily, a comedy, and it is funny. So it succeeds. But it could have been so much better. Instead of being a tight, acerbic satire of early feminist breakthroughs in sexist, boys dominated 1970s institutions. Instead, it is dominated by Farrell (who tailored the script himself) to such an extent that it becomes a showcase for him to experiment with all his goofy comic talent. Thus the comedy falls from the rank of those that are both funny and meaningful and holds itself shabbily together as a reduculous goofball romp. Shame.",1110067200,,1386,5.0524017467248905

1543272,4,B00005JMYI,"There's not much I can add about the story of this film that hasn't already been told. The movie is based on actual events. It tells a parodic version of the times when female newscasters were brought to the TV stations. Will Ferrell is to die for - while his character displays a stupid male chauvinist, he is very likable. Great DVD features - some deleted scenes, and extended parts of scenes that made it, had me laughing louder than I'd heard anyone laugh before. The end of the movie seemed a bit too easily ""rounded off"" to me though. I liked the jokes in the first half better, but that's just me. On the whole this is a funny film that you can watch more than once. Obviously people involved in the production KNEW that this wasn't going to be a worldwide HIT ...it's not as mainstream a movie as Lord of The Rings ;) ...but despite the sillyness of Anchorman, I think it craves a more mature audience than most Will Ferrell movies of the past.

Incidentally, I sometimes get the feeling that people give reviews ""yes"" and ""no"" votes based on whether they agree with the amount of stars that the reviewer has given a certain product. It is a personal question, but it still reads ""was this review HELPFUL to you?""

1543277,3,B00005JMYI,"`Anchorman, The Legend of Ron Burgundy' (the unrated version) cowritten by and starring Will Ferrell is a sophomoric comedy based on one idea borrowed from the very rich plot of `Broadcast News', spiked with some tired themes the character Ted Baxter of the Mary Tyler Moore Show plus some other borrowings from less likely sources such as `Monty Python and the Holy Grail'.

For starters, I simply did not laugh at this movie. Not once! It was less funny to me than a Three Stooges short, and I don't like the Three Stooges. This is not to say I don't appreciate some good potty humor now and then. I happen to think that Kevin Smith's foul-mouthed marathons such as `Dogma' and `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' are really very, very funny.

One of the most deadly aspects of the movie was that it was predictable. You can see punchlines coming from two blocks away. Even the crudest, cheapest gag / shock value in the movie which involved Burgundy's small, much beloved dog being kicked off the highest point of the high bridge over San Diego bay could be anticipated, as improbable as cruelty to animals scenes are in movies. The fact that the canine body falling to San Diego bay was so obviously a dummy dog neither improved the comedy nor took the sting out of the cheapness of the business.

Ferrell has had a fair amount of success since he left Saturday Night Live and many, including Kevin Smith attest to his comedic abilities, but I just don't see it. I watched `Elf' a few months ago and I could appreciate that it was a better than average Christmas movie, but it really wasn't anything special. I just don't think Ferrell has the kind of natural comedic talent of people like Billy Crystal or Dan Aykroyd, let alone the comic geniuses like Jim Carrey, Bill Murray, and Robin Williams. Carrey and even Williams can sometimes become parodies of themselves, but the lapses usually don't last too long, and in any given 5 minutes on the screen they will get a laugh out of you by hook or by crook.

There are many ways in which this is not a really bad movie. It probably is no less a cartoon of its subject than `Zoolander' or `Animal', but it is neither laugh out loud funny like `Garfield' nor `wryly funny like `Doonesbury'. The only character in the movie for which I had any sympathy at all was the news director played by Fred Willard. Ferrell's foil, the female newscaster played by Christina Applegate was too predictable and unnatural to elicit much empathy from me, especially since her competition was so artificial.

If a movie is good, I typically rate DVDs on the basis of the quality of the bonus features. This is why a Kevin Smith DVD is such a good bargain compared to even great classic comedy DVDs such as `Ghostbusters' or `Some Like It Hot'. If the principals are not around to provide a good commentary, the rewatchability drops a bit. But this movie is not entertaining to begin with, so what interest do I have in listening to a commentary of why they decided to punt a dog dummy off the San Diego bridge.

The movie begins by proudly stating: ""The following is based on actual events. Only the names, locations and events have been changed.""

From then on the laughs never stop. It is Junior High humor at its best.

The delightful Ms. Christina Applegate as Veronica Corningstone and Will Ferrell as Ron Burgundy are the dynamic duo of commedy.

Pay attention to the background: there are a lot of funny things going on. My favorite was a big sign in front of a Mexican restaurant: ""Escupimos en su comida."" You don't want to be a ""gringo"" in that part of town.

Baxter the dog shows extraordinary skill at stealing all his scenes and at the end walks away with the movie. He was not listed in the credits and that was a sad oversight. Baxter deserved an Academy nomination.

Steve Carell describes Brick Tamland his character as ""an independent thinker because he thinks independently of his brain - intelligence is not one of his attributes."" Tamland himself says that his IQ is 48.

Brick Tamland ends his career as one of the top political advisers to the Bush White House. And that, folks, may be more than satire.

Each character is steriotypical but to the extreme, mix that is with the quirky personalities, and you have an undeniably funny cast. Will Ferrell stars as Ron Burgundy, the top-rated anchorman in San Diego in the `70s. Feminism marches into the newsroom in the form of ambitious newswoman Veronica Corningstone Ron is willing to play along at first-as long as Veronica stays in her place, covering cat fashion shows, cooking, and other ""female"" interests. But when Veronica refuses to settle for being eye candy and steps behind the news desk, it's more than a battle between two perfectly coiffed anchor-persons...well it's all out war. The comedic take on a woman invading the news desk in the 1970s was inspired by a decidedly more serious documentary on the women who actually broke that glass ceiling. Will Ferrell was watching the documentary, which featured interviews with several anchormen of the 1970s, and found some of the interviews with the newsmen to be unintentionally funny.",1108684800,,1068,5.14367816091954

1543624,2,B00005JMYI,"This movie, starring Will Farrell in the main role, is a weak attempt at comedy from director Adam McKay. As much as I like Farrell from his Saturday Night Live days, this movie is a little too juvenile in humor and plot to make it a good comedy.

Farrell and his female co- star Christina Applegate fight for attention in this film as they battle it out for the role as lead anchor on the local news. Farrell has held this role on the news for many years and doesn't want to relinquish his position to a woman. The movie is set in the 1970's- a time of feminism and social revolution- and the rivalry turns into a battle of the sexes between the two adults. This is a pretty standard movie formula and it could have worked better if the writing was more engaging and the comedy more sincere.

The humor in this film is mostly bathroom- style and the jokes are primarily the types that appeal to younger kids. There isn't much in the way of original comedy, and what little originality the film can muster up is still juvenile and silly. In a matter of seconds, most of us could think of jokes and general humor at least as good as that offered here in Anchorman.

Will Farrell is good in this role, and I liked Applegate. The addition of Fred Willard to the cast was also a good idea, but I would have liked it if Willard had a greater role. The other supporting cast of goons is rather lame and I can think of many actors/actresses who could have done just as well. On the other hand, the script of this film makes it tough for anyone to perform very well.

Overall, Anchorman is a movie to pass on unless you're in the mood for this type of brainless comedy. Maybe if I had been in a more giddy disposition from the start, I would have liked this film more than I did. But taken as it is, this movie is a throwaway, with only a few drops of real comedy in large pool of manufactured laughs.",1106611200,4,1893,4.220994475138122

He brings in a funny cast especially Paul Rudd who I did not recognize but was funny too. My favorite scene is when he reads something hes not on the news report. Ron reads everything. It's so funny. Christina Applegate does a good job too as the woman anchor who all the men try to pick up in very perverted sexual ways. you'll laugh so hard. The crew is jealous of the new female reporter and try to do everything to fire her with some obnoxious and funny scenes. Christina finaly gets her break as co-anchor for one evening when Ron does not show up to due a ""dog problem"". Christina does the news and all hell breaks loose between the two of them and they start exchanging nasty words to each other and  physically fighting by throwing things at each other.  Finally Christina gets back at Ron by writing something on the teleprompt that Ron isn't supposed to read but does without noticing, which is hilarious.  This fuels more anger between the two makes for more funny scenes to come.  Ben Stiller has a cameo as a Mexical news anchor, Tim Robbins another cameo,  and Vince Vaughn is good too.  Luke Wilson also has a cameo in this one.

Who better to play a smarmy anchorman than Will Ferrell, but sadly this movie was so badly scripted, dawdling over its many raunchy one-liners, like a 9-year proud of his first dirty joke.  Outside of cutting a striking figure in a white jumpsuit, Christina Applegate failed to create the sexual tension this movie badly needed to keep it afloat.  The jokes and gags may have looked good on paper but failed to materialize on the screen.  Even the big fight between rival news gangs failed to deliver, despite bringing out Hollywood heavy-hitters like Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller.  All in all, this movie was a sad disappointment.  Will Ferrell can do much better than this.",1106524800,5,704,4.776859504132231
1543628,3,B00005JMYI,"I loved Anchorman in the theatre.  I had been looking forward to the DVD release of this movie for months after seeing it.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, the ""unrated"" version is inferior to the theatrical version and the only way you can see the theatrical version anymore is in the crappy full-screen, pan & scan format.

One of my favorite scenes in the movie (the boardroom scene where the news team discusses their hangovers from the previous night's party) is replaced with an alternate version that was ""edgier"" and ""unrated"", but less funny.

Also, the only real extended part of the movie is where the ""once beloved"" Ron Burgundy is now down-on-his-luck, eating a cat turd in the restaurant that he used to be an honored guest in.  It's a bit much and I think it takes away from the movie (which is probably the reason it wasn't included in the theatrical version) but hey, it's ""unrated"" so I guess that makes it funnier right?

But that's just my opinion. You may like the ""Unrated, Uncut, and Uncalled For"" version better - I just don't - but for some reason the only way I can see the version that I want to see is if it's in the retarded full-screen DVD format (why do they even make these anymore?).  It's the illusion of choice to have the ""standard"" and ""unrated"" versions available, but the way Dreamworks offers it (with no wide-screen option for the ""standard"" but funnier edition) there's really no choice at all.

That's all the time I have here.  Stay classy and thanks for stopping by.",1106438400,3,1509,4.600746268656716
1543629,2,B00005JMYI,"I have to agree with many reviewers on this movie in that it wasn't that entertaining to watch. I think that's pretty sad when you watch and see good actors like Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins are in this movie (although they didn't have any big role). Ferrell is the San Diego anchorman Ron Burgundy who is the number one anchorman in the city and lives up to the superstar fame. Watching him was almost like watching al bundy from married with children as he appeared to be nothing more than a bum. It seemed like all Ron could do really well is read off what he saw on the screen and try to make it sound interesting. The whole news cast was very cocky and arrogant as they felt that noone could stop them. There was one hilarous scene that involved four other local news team meeting up in an alley and trying to patch up their difference in bloody war which ends up killing a few people and cutting off some body parts which was pretty much the only real funny scene in the movie. Of course, things change when

Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) arrives and is looking to be an anchorman herself. Of course, she would have her work cut out for her as a newsroom of predominate males felt that it wasn't designed for a woman. Even though she probably thought it was wrong, she falls head over heels over Ron when they hook up at a nightclub and shows off his other talent by playing the flute. Things would eventually change when Ron showed up late for work and Veronica filled in for him. Ron is furious and shows his male ego which irriates Veronica and ends the relationship. However, Veronica decided to not stop there and she publicly humilated Ron and caused him to get fired when she changed up some of the words on the screen. Without a job and the whole city ticked off at him for his words on the air, Ron hit deep depression. Now the news channel is concerned as now all the other local stations can now have a shot at competiting with them. However, Veronica does go the extra mile to try and bring Ron back. Ron must convince his staff who no longer worked for the news channel. Eventually, the group does get back together in time to cover a huge story at the zoo which the other four local news teams were trying to get the big scope on. Ron ends up saving Veronica from become the lunch of a tiger and saved the news team. The two ended up renewing their relationship and were co-anchors.

However, where the movie lacks in the comedy category it really represents the 70's accurately with the whole ""men rule the world"" type deal.

1543731,3,B00005JMYI,"Ron Burgundy would have made an interesting character on Saturday Night Live.  Will Ferrell's skills of observation and exaggeration create a familiar, self-absorbed anchorman ripe for satire.  In five minute sketches, Burgundy would have been yet another hilarious contribution to SNL from Ferrell.  But an entire movie?

Unlike Buddy from ""Elf"" or other creations from SNL alums like Austin Powers, Ron Burgundy simply lacks the substance to carry a film.  After the first few scenes, he is just not funny anymore.  Without juvenile bathroom humor, crude sex jokes and a supporting cast filled with exaggerated, freakishly cliched sidekicks, not many laughs would be found in this movie.

With that said, Ferrell should be commended for once again tackling a role that requires him to look foolish and unattractive, while asking the audience to laugh AT him (not WITH him).  After equally brave choices in ""Elf"" and ""Old School"", Ferrell really seems to be an actor who doesn't take himself too seriously and is without any fear of becoming labeled a ""clown"".",1105747200,4,1061,5.16374269005848
1543732,2,B00005JMYI,"After some excellent work by Will Ferrell in 'Old School' and 'Elf', I decided to go out and get 'Anchorman' despite some pretty bad reviews I had been hearing. However, the reviews were right and Anchorman dissapoints. Ferrell plays 1970's anchorman Ron Burgundy for Channel 4 news in San Diego, and is on top of the world. He's a local legend, his station is number 1, and even little kids know who Ron Burgundy is. However, to add more diversity to the news, they hire a female, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate of 'Married with Children') to the team. Eventually, she becomes co-anchor with Burgundy. We now have the typical battle of the sexes going on, while they both try to get the lead anchor position.

There are some good cameos by Vince Vaugn, who will always come in second place to Ferrell's TV ratings, Ben Stiller, who plays a Hispanic anchorman, and Jack Black, the angry biker who gets a burrito thrown at him by Burgundy. The funniest character in this movie, no, not Ferrell, but Steve Carell who plays the clueless weatherman, Brick Tamland.

In the 1970s, chauvinistic news anchorman Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) and his cocky Channel 4 buddies are the most popular news team in San Diego. When competent news journalist Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) becomes the station's first female co-anchor, Burgundy plots to get rid of his new coworker at all cost. ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is a marvelously entertaining comedy with great comic talent. The fun-filled summer comedy has a likable story, hilarious characters and some wildly amusing laughs. Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate have great onscreen comic chemistry. ""Anchorman"" also features a great supporting cast including Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Steve Carell, Fred Willard and Vince Vaughn, and funny appearances by Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller and Jack Black.

If you can't get enough of Will Ferrell, then ""Anchorman"" Extended Edition is right for you. The enjoyable comedy is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD has an enjoyable video transfer with good resolution, and a pleasant Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.

1543837,3,B00005JMYI,"The power of parody can be strong when the story has been revealed and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy has a powerful effect on the audience as it's story of male chauvinism, sexual harassment, and male insecurity has been depicted.  The parody is frequently over the top, which is the purpose of the parody, and it enhances small things men do in order to be portrayed as strong males.  In Anchorman, the parody brings out Ron Burgundy's insecurities in regards to women and other men, which often are either clever or belly-achingly hilarious.

The story highlights Ron Burgundy's (Will Ferrell) escapades as a news anchorman for a local TV station in San Diego at the beginning of the 1970s.  The time is before cable TV and channel surfing.  Before the film begins the audience is displayed a short statement informing the viewers that the film is based on a true story where the only thing that have been changed are the names, the location, and the events.  This throws in an interesting perspective as the film unfolds as there are several stories where male chauvinism and sexual harassment have taken place at the work place.

Anchorman begins with a party after Ron and his cohorts have found out that their station KVWN is ranked number one in the city of San Diego.  During the party Ron and his three buddies Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), Champ Kind (David Koechner), and Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) entertain themselves with booze, women, and superficial conversations as Ron discovers a beautiful blond.  The blond woman is Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) whom Ron insults with sexual suggestions and later finds out that his new station has diversified by hiring Veronica as a part of the news group.  This raises an uprising among Ron and his men as they proclaim that women cannot do the work they are performing.  Instead the men begin to make crude sexual jokes in regards to Veronica and the sexual harassment has begun.

Veronica is aware that the line of work that she has chosen is male dominated, yet she strives to accomplish her dream to become a news anchor.  The assignments that she receives are silly as they include cat fashion shows and alike.  The men at the news station persist in keeping her away from the real work, as she is a woman and in their perspective women cannot perform the same kind of work as men.  However, after an accident with a biker (Jack Black), Ron is held back due to emotional distress, and Veronica sees her moment of opportunity, which she seizes.  This is the beginning of the end for Ron as he is about to put the final nail in the coffin by saying a four letter word beginning with f in regards to the people of San Diego at the end of a show.

There is a scene in the film where Ron and his friends end up in a street brawl with all kinds of gruesome weapons.  This scene is a culminating analogy with strong satirical suggestions in regards to male insecurities, which are often attempted to be hidden behind a large dose of aggressive behavior.  In the scene there are four other news stations that are represented by Wes Mantooth (Vince Vaughn), Frank Vitchard (Luke Wilson), a Public TV News Anchor (Tim Robbins), and a Hispanic TV News Anchor (Ben Stiller), and instead of trying to find a solution these men let testosterone flow as an arm is chopped off and a man on a horse is impaled by a trident.

Anchorman has several interesting moments where the parody offers much laughter, yet there are moments when the humor does not work.  Despite the moments of lacking laughter Anchorman will provide a good cinematic experience as the film offers both humor, insight, and valuable lessons.  The parody,  as mentioned, comes together in the end as a powerful tool to depict an important lesson in regards to male chauvinism, sexual harassment, and male insecurity.  The humor might be necessary for some hardcore alpha-males as they might recognize themselves in the story, and it might otherwise be offensive for all viewers.  Nevertheless, Adam McKay and his cast put together a well-made comedy with a valuable message.",1105315200,,4108,4.744022503516175
1543838,4,B00005JMYI,"I bought this DVD mainly because of Will Ferrell. Almost anything he does I often find hilarious. Also, I liked the supporting cast with Paul Rudd, Steve Carrell, David Koechner, and Fred Willard. Well, the first time I watched it, I got about 20 minutes into it, and popped it out of my DVD player. Didn't care for it, didn't particularly find it very funny. I was pretty disappointed.

Then I let a couple of friends watch it. They watched it while I was in adjacent room, working on a project for work. And they pretty much laughed throughout the entire movie. Laughed HARD. I couldn't figure out what they were laughing at, as I sure didn't expect them to find it as amusing as they did. One of them said it was the funniest movie he had seen in years!

Well, now, I had to give this movie another shot. I'm glad I did. Little did I know; what a hilarious movie! I found myself laughing so I hard I literally hurt! I don't know whether it was just kind of slow in the beginning, or I really didn't have my mind on it, or what. I think a lot of people who didn't like the movie did like I did the first time I saw it, and gave up on it much too early. This is destined to become a cult classic, believe me! Pay attention to Steve Carrell, who plays the weatherman. He used to crack me up on ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"". He has some of the best moments in the movie. Vince Vaughn actually has some significant screen time in this, and he is more like the Vince Vaughn from ""Old School"" and less like the Vince Vaughn from, (ugghh!) ""Dodgeball"".

Just give this movie a chance, if upon first viewing you find it not to your liking. You just might find it worth your while.",1105228800,4,1679,4.191950464396285
1543839,5,B00005JMYI,"There's no way that a cast which includes some of the funniest comedic actors of the new century could fail.  That's not just Will Ferrell, but Christina Appelgate, Fred Willard  and Steve Corell from Comedy Central's Daily Show.  Separately, they've each made their own success in past roles but here in Anchorman they're a comic force ad libbing their way through a script that sets an already impressive foundation.  I nearly cracked in half a few times.

The premise is, what was it like that historic day in the `70s when the first woman went in front of the camera, not as a cheesecake weather girl but as a serious reporter?  The all-male news team reacts with the predictable; attempts to sabotage her with innuendo and psychological warfare, seduction, immature jokes.  The sort of stuff that happens any time a woman ""invades"" a male-dominated field.  Only Veronica (the much-underrated Christina Applegate) handles it all with a bemused tolerance and class.  Nothing could bring her down, that is, until the impossible happened...she falls for Ron Burgundy.  Ron, the living stereotype of chauvinism and a Jr. High Schoolboy mentality, is lonely underneath all of his unqualified success as a tv news anchor.  Can love temper their differences and bridge the gap between the sexes?

I think that what makes Anchorman work is an underlying glee at lampooning the self-important, phony airs put on by talking head all over the country.  In every well-modulated tone, every pretentious turn of phrase and every carefully choreographed inflection we can see the Channel Four News Team's hilarious, accurate mimicry. The entire cast has it down perfectly.  We instinctively recognize that it's a delicious send-up of the so-called journalists we are familiar with as a television audience.

Then again, if you don't watch the news on television you probably won't get half of the in-jokes.  That would explain *some* people's reactions, but...

A niggling thought occurs:  could it be that Anchorman's detractors were uncomfortably reminded of their own behavior at times?  Really and truly folks, the film's message about `70s sexism was delivered with lightheartedness, gently, and with no righteous fury whatsoever.  And yet, some people may take even the lightest poke as a full frontal assault.  A case of a guilty conscience making for a sensitive viewer, perhaps?

In any case, I plead with you not to allow a few negative comments from other reviewers to keep you from seeing what I think may be the funniest film of 2004.

1543914,3,B00005JMYI,"Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is a 1970's chauvinist anchorman. The old boy newsroom antics are on full display. Crude jokes and sexual overtones are the norm.

1543917,4,B00005JMYI,"I don't think anyone goes to a Will Ferrell movie expecting high comedy.  ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is a crude and often silly movie.  However, if you take the time to look just a bit deeper, there are some pretty sly comments on the late 60's and early 70's when women were just entering the workforce and men were losing their minds.  Men could not conceive that women would not only take some jobs, but that there were women who would be better at their job than they were.

No, this goofy comedy doesn't present these points in any kind of consistent and convincing way.  But hey, when women began working in newsrooms and everywhere else, what they faced every day was not all that intelligent, consistent, or convincing either.  There is a reason we have laws about hostile environments in the workplace.

Will Farrell plays Ron Burgundy, the kind of local news anchor that existed when local news actually mattered.  He is a real celebrity in San Diego.  He has his news team buddies and these idiots rule the roost.  In comes Veronica Corningstone, played wonderfully by Christina Applegate (always undervalued in my book).  She is given the cat show types of stories until something happens and she gets a chance to actually read the local news.  This is a momentous occasion and, of course, she knocks it out of the park.

Along the way Veronica and Ron develop a relationship.  She was particularly won over by his playing the Jazz Flute at a local club.  This is one of the better scenes in the movie.  Who remembers when playing the flute was actually something people, even men, did?  The 60s-70s was such a time.  And the wonderfully hideous shades of brown in their clothes bring back lots of awful memories for me.  A few more overwhelming greens would have made that image complete, but the brown sufficed.

Anyway, the development of the relationship, its struggles and victories, is hardly the point of the movie.  Nor are its moments approaching intelligence.  The movie is a goofball comedy.  Just expect some rough language, and the kind of bawdy jokes that went on in every workplace during those times, and you will not be too shocked.  Vulgar, yes.  Obscene, no.

Have fun.",1104883200,,2213,4.712793733681462
1543918,3,B00005JMYI,"Will Ferrell's first big comedy after Elf won't rake in the dollars that his holiday heartwarmer did, nor is it likely to go over as well with critics, who were able to forgive Elf's schmaltzy ending due to the imaginative gags. Anchorman is a pretty funny comedy, although there is nothing much to occupy our minds as we wait for the next funny joke. The movie takes a shotgun approach, spraying us liberally with jokes to see what sticks, and enough did that I was happy walking out of the theater. The storyline is pretty simple-Ron Burgundy is a bigshot local tv anchorman in the seventies, who is so entrenched in the way that things are that he can't even conceive of an aspiring female anchor as a threat. He quickly falls in love with said aspirant Applegate, but they break up as soon as her encroachment on his professional turf is too much to ignore. Happy ending, blah blah blah.",1104796800,,891,4.540372670807454
1543919,1,B00005JMYI,I rented this movie over New Years weekend.  It was so bad I fast forwarded it in parts to get to the end to see what happens. I didn't think most of it was funny . I thought it was a comedy as it was advertised as such.  There might be a couple lines you could laugh at. I would not recommend it for anyone under the teen years.  Some of the comedy revolves around sex and attitudes. Over all I believe I wasted my rental fee and I am glad I didn't buy the movie.,1104796800,7,464,3.8125
1543920,3,B00005JMYI,"After watching ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,"" it is clear to me that the funniest television anchorman of all-time remains Ted Baxter on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show.""  I say this knowing that for the most part I could not stand the Ted Baxter character and while I was not exactly wincing at the one-liners in this 2004 comedy, I was not laughing a lot either.  The script by director Adam McKay and star Will Ferrell sets up some comic opportunities but tends not to take advantage of them.  For example, it is established early on that Burgundy will say anything that is written on a teleprompter.  While this comes up as a major plot development, it strikes me as a waste of a really good running gag because they could have come up with so much more.

Ron Burgundy represents the news anchor in his prime, circa San Diego in the 1970s.  Arrogant and narcissistic, not to mention incapable of saying anything that does not sound pompous and egotistical, Burgundy is enabled by his producer Ed Harken (Fred Willard), and the rest of the evening news team: hip roving reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner), and clueless weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell, Bruce Almighty).  Into their male dominated world comes Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), who wants to read the news her self, apparently unconcerned that it is a man's job.  Thus, the battle lines are drawn between Veronica and all of the guys as the station.

Now, a battle of the sexes sounds pretty good, but that idea is undercut by the fact that a romance springs up between Burgundy and Corningstone.  The fact that they have the hots for each other does not take away from their ambition, and the funniest scenes for me in the film are when the two of them are muttering insults each other at the end of the newscast while the credits role.  But there should have been a lot more comedy to be milked from their on camera battles, and ""Anchorman"" is to busy running on to the next bit to stop and figure out how everything fits together.  This is a film that has people singing ""Afternoon Delight"" at one moment and then has news teams getting ready to rumble in a back alley.  But it never comes together with any sort of unified comedy theory that makes it all work.  Instead we are left with bits and pieces with as many misses as hits.

The bottom line for me is that ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" should have been a satire, and it ends up being nothing more than an over-extended comedy sketch.  The movie is set in the 1970s and you would think that should come into play more in terms of the comedy, but it really does not.  The flaw, I suspect, is that McKay and Ferrell know that their SNL audience has little in the way of a rudimentary knowledge of that particular decade (to wit, leisure suits and facial hair), so the story is set back then simply so the idea of a female news anchor can be see as a radical idea.  But even that become another font of comic opportunity that ""Anchorman"" neglects to use to great effect.  The result is okay, and Ferrell certainly tries hard, but for me the entire movie has as many laughs as one of his really good SNL skits, and when you are talking a feature length movie, that is not a good thing.",1104796800,26,3286,4.5109612141652615

Everyone else, if you're thinking of buying this..DON'T..even renting this would be unwise. I don't deny Farrell is talented, but not in this.

For example, there is a voice over at the end for a character that is never seen in the movie. Was that intentional and not funny? Or was it unintentional and sloppy editing? The language is bad in spots. Furthermore, there is a lot of yelling in the movie by different characters. I am not sure why that is funny.

The good points were the dog was cute, Steve Carrel as Brick was funny, and some of the cameos were funny. I won't spoil the cameos, because who they got to play which character is part of the fun. Unfortunately, the rest of the scene was not as funny.

1544003,5,B00005JMYI,"This is one of the best comedies to come out in the past year.  If you liked Old School you will love this movie.  Will Ferell stars in this movie as Ron Burgandy, who is the local news anchor in San Diego.  The setting for this movie is the 1970's when not many women had important jobs (at least in the movie).  The main point of this movie revolves around a women who falls in love with Ferell and then when he does not show up for work one day, does the nightly news.  This devestates Ferell and everything in his life just goes down from there.

This movie is appropriate for almost anyone as long as they can handle certain swearing.  There is only 1 part of the movie where there are bad words and it lasts for only about 15 seconds.  There are many funny parts to this movie, and the characters are played to extreme.

I would recomment this movie to anyone who needs cheering up or has liked any of Wil Ferrell's past movies.

1544006,4,B00005JMYI,"Adam Mckay's Anchorman is a pretty funny, comedy/sex romp starring Will Ferrell doing what he is known for making a jackass of himself for our amusement. He is superbly funny in the movie despite the many shortcoming the movie has. For example
Ferrell's cast members like Steve Carrell are not funny at all,
in fact he has some stupid lines in the movie.

For instance after everyone gets drunk at Ron's party , his character Brick Tamland mentions the awful thing he did: ""I ate a red candle"". Later on in an office meeting when its announced
tbat a woman will enter the hormone male infested world of
KWN Brick yells but admits he doesnt know why. This is not
funny, I think Steve was tacked in at the last moment as a favor for somebody.

As someboy else mentioned if you never seen any of Ferrel's
stuff youll not only think its not funny but offensive as well.
Ron Burgundy while prouding himself as a ""stud"" is completely
offensive to women, they're just sex objects to him.

Even when an Angel appears in Veronica Corningstone, he cant help but make a fool of himself in picking her  up:
""You have a breaktaking heinie"", he says. LMAO

Later on when the two are working together, he cant even
give keep his physical attraction from her:
""Mr. Burgandy you have a massive erection"" says Veronica Corningstone.

What the hell is this? Porn talk. LOL

But since the movie takes place in the 70's with these loose
morals, one expect this in ""Anchorman"". I recommened it only for Ferrel fans.

The dvd as well despite having a boatload of extras is somewhat
disappointing in the commentary track, with Ferrell only kidding around and telling jokes but giving no details about h9w the movie was made. For that I recommend the featurette on the film.

Anyhow ""Anchorman"" is a funny movie.",1104624000,,1787,4.59433962264151
1544007,4,B00005JMYI,"I LOVED this movie when I saw it in the theatre over the past summer- so I was pumped to see an ""unrated"" version come out on DVD.

Whomever was in charge of putting this DVD together yanked a huge chain on this release.  I had expected the ""unrated"" version to be funnier than the theatrical version which I thought was one of the year's funniest movies, because in general, ""unrated"" cuts have been better than the ""regular"" release.

This ""unrated"" version skips a couple really great monents from the theatrical version, one instance is when Carell's character ""Brick"" utters ""I ate a big red candle"" during the party hangover sequence and they replace it with a joke that's nowhere near that great non-sequitor.  Near the end of the film they edited out Ferrell's lines just before he picks up the phone in the bar (something about ""once being an anchorman"")which was more in line with the film's plot/angle than the new scene of Burgundy eating cat poop. A TERRIBLY UNFUNNY ADDITION.

The crapper of it is, the unrated DVD has different and admittedly better extras than the theatrical DVD release, so to actually get the theatrical cut(which is a better cut than the unrated version) the customer gets screwed if they want the better extra features.  lame.

in all actuality this review would be 4 for the movie, and 1 for the way this fiasco was put out on DVD.",1104537600,117,1369,4.655601659751038

With that said I was eagerly awaiting the Dvd release, and when I found about this new Unrated version, I was even more excited.  But when I got it and took it home and watched it, the unrated part fell flat.  It's a joke.  The reason it's unrated is because Burgundy says the f word fives times now instead of the 1 time in the orginal cut.  There's also a scene where he must eat cat poop.  The other few minimal new scenes don't add to the movie at all.  I think the unrated part was a joke to get higher sales.

It's been a while since I saw this movie in the theatre, so I can't remember a lot of specifics.  I do remember being annoyed and bored throughout a good portion of the movie.

And what exactly do they say to each other when they break for commercial and we can't hear what they say?. Or when it's over and the credits roll?. Well, we find out here, and it's one of a number of deliriously silly and funny moments that fill up this goofy, but funny satire. Will Ferrell, who can do no wrong by this reviewer, continues his streak of making funny, enjoyable little pieces of comedy fluff. This is probably his most inspired creation so far. The film is narrated by Bill Kurtis, an A&E staple who hosts such shows as ""Cold Case Files"", and ""American Justice"". Will plays Ron Burgundy, a local 1970's anchorman in San Diego(or San Diago as he has called it), who seems to be riding high on all fronts. He is an insanely childish and pompous, and the lights are pretty dim in that well coiffed melon of his. He's treated like an important celebrity(or at least he think he is)and he is living the high life. Along with his buddies. Champ Kind(David Koechner), is the cowboy hat wearing sports guy, and has an unhealthy interest in Ron. Roving reporter Brian Fontana(Paul Rudd), is the big mustached ladies man. And then there is weatherman Brick Tamland(the hilarious Steve Carrel), a simpleton who has been declared ""mentally retarded"". The guys' male dominated lifestyle and world is shaken up when the station hires Veronica Corningstone(Christina Applegate), a hot young lady who aspires to be a top anchor herself, and throwing a wrench in what the men, and life at that time in general, thought of as an ""only men"" kind of thing. A time when women didn't have the power they have now. When they were assistants or secreteries, and were seldom seen, and heard even less. As the movie shows it as being. Once she arrives, the comedy really kicks in, especially when the two result to petty pranks and name calling to make it to the top. The always great Fred Willard co-stars as the station's boss. There is no great plot or meaning here, except for Will and the gang to have fun with their characters and make a silly little comedy that is only meant for pure fun and entertainment. They succeeded. It is no surprise that Applegate is funny and holds her own. She practically comes from an entire life of comedy, and her ditzy work as Kelly Bundy on ""Married With Children"" was an inspired bit of comedy buffoonery acting, and was not appreciated in the right way. She has come a long way from that role with tons of other parts since then. Ferrell is the kind of comedian who will just jump right in there and do it. No matter what. Burgundy can get a bit tiring after a while, but he is always ready to pull you back in with a funny line or scene. Carrel, as Brick, gets the most laughs here. There is a great scene where our reporters are confronted by the other channel's news teams in a hilarious ""battle"" scene. The moment is only made better because of the cameo appearances from stars who plays the other top anchors. I won't say who. That will spoil the fun. The design of the film works real well and has that 70's look and vibe, and the outfits and facial hair are hysterical. As is the use of The Starlight Vocal Band's hit, ""Afternoon Delight"". The DVD claims it is the unrated, unedited version, but I never saw the original theatrical release, so I couldn't tell you what is newly put in and what is there. The special features are a delight. There are bloopers, which can also be found during the end credits, and outtakes, and lots more. Plus a hilarious video of the already mentioned song above. Bill Kurtis himself appears in a feature that has him having a 10 minute talk with Ron Burgundy.

It never tries to be anything but fun. There is a great ""West Side Story"" like rumble between news stations that borders on Monty Python funny which is saying a lot for Ferrell.

Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy; Cristina Applegate plays Veronica Corningstone, the newcomer on the block with a strong willed desire to be an anchor herself. Farrell, especially being the male chauvinist as he is, sees Corningstone's arrival as yet another chance to have himself a conquest. Corningstone, predictably in this type of plot, wants no part in an office romance. Worse yet for Ron Burgundy and his male buddies on the news show: newcomer Veronica Corningstone actually knows something about journalism!

There are numerous funny moments in this movie here on DVD. There's of course the gang warfare between five (count 'em, five) separate news channels that's really well done. Another scene worth mention is the scene with Ron's dog that despite being a bit troubling is actually hysterical. There's Steve Carrell as the weatherman with a questionable IQ level who refers to the state of Iowa as ""the Middle East.""  Moreover, there are some great cameos by such pros as Tim Robbins, Danny Trejo and Ben Stiller.

While watching this movie you get the sense that the actors really wanted to do it to showcase their talents and just plain have fun making a fun movie. My advice is not to go into this comedy expecting it to be literally flawless. Instead, this comedy flick is perfect for the person who wants to enjoy some laughs and funny situations while relaxing their brain and not worrying about following a complicated plot. Yes, I know, there's the subplot theme of the 70's feminist movement, but without any doubt this takes a back seat to the comedy.

The DVD comes with great extras that increase its value. Extras include the ""Making of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,"" bloopers and deleted scenes, and (of course) the ""Ron Burgundy A&E Biography."" Sound and picture quality are very good.

I would encourage you to get this DVD: the movie itself is very good for a fun time! Fans of Farrell and the Saturday Night Live style of comedy are going to be especially pleased with the way they made this DVD! The extras make it all the more worthwhile.",1104192000,21,2252,4.808785529715762
1544194,4,B00005JMYI,"Those people that have not liked previous Will Ferrell movies don't need to read on because this movie will not change their minds. For those of us that do like him the Anchorman is a movie that works tirelessly to make you laugh and like most comedies that are this far out on the fringe of slapstick humor some jokes work and some jokes don't. The jokes that do work are very funny. The supporting cast in this movie gets the bulk of the best jokes, in particular Steve Carrell as the weatherman. He is awesome in this movie and in time will be a star himself. He was also very good two summers ago in Bruce Almighty and has made me laugh a lot on the Comedy Network.

I think this film will hold more laughs for the people old enough to remember living in the 1970's. Some of the jokes poking fun at that era will go over the heads of younger viewers. That's not to say they won't laugh, just maybe not as many times. If you like Will Ferrell you will enjoy this movie.",1103760000,,972,4.170212765957447
1544195,1,B00005JMYI,"If for any other reason Anchorman proves that Will Farrell is stuck in the Character routine.  In almost all of his movies he plays either a hyper childish character, or a mindless sex addict esc character.

Will Farrell plays Ron Burgundy, the #1 news anchor in the San Fransisco area during the 70's.  He has his posse of news men and together they rule.  However while holding an office party (at his place no less) he meets Veronica (Christina Applegate), a young woman who inspires to be a news anchor.  Ron falls in love with her but his over inflated ego (and stupidity) eventually gets him into trouble not only with her, but with the news station as well.  In the end though he makes a triumphant comeback and lands on a national network.

For the most part this movie is dull, unfunny, and overall a mess.  The characters are cliched and the fact of the matter is that Will Farrell is starting to show signs of mediocracy.  He is always in one way or another the same character.  The only time I laughed during this entire mess was a gang fight between five different News stations (with the leaders played by Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins, and Ben Stiller).  That scene was actually clever and funny, the rest of the movie garbage, avoid like the plauge.",1103760000,5,1274,4.543859649122807
1544196,3,B00005JMYI,"How stupid is this?  Well, pretty stupid.  Consider the scene where the News at Five teams from the various local stations (in San Diego) square off, gladiator style complete with tridents, swords and axes.  Or how about Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) reading everything put on the teleprompter--""You put it there, he'll read it"" including the ""f"" word.  Or the musical score in the background, a selection of the most sappy seventies tunes including (God help us) ""Skyrockets in flight/Afternoon delight.""

I watched this on a United Airlines flight and took a read on the other passengers.  The guy in the window seat was in and out of sleep most of the time, and there weren't many of the other passengers laughing, at least not aloud.  However I have to say almost everybody put on their headsets and watched.  I attribute that to the mass bucks the producers spent on advertising.  I just had to check it out.

And it WAS kind of fascinating to see a film done this way, so much so that even if you don't laugh, you might be glued to the tube anyway.  The satirical idea is to lampoon TV news anchors as empty-headed, surface kind of people who wouldn't know a differential equation from their hair spray.  Ferrell is perfectly shallow and vain and arrogant--and that is right on target.  However he proves the counterpoint to the movie's premise by actually being Quite a Guy, especially in the scene at the bar restaurant when he gets up to play the flute.  He plays one mean flute, I gotta tell you.

Ferrell gets support from Christine Applegate as Veronica Corningstone who wants to become the anchorperson herself.  Most comedy fans will remember Applegate as the ditsy and voluptuous Kelly from TV's ""Married with Children"" where she started out when she was something like 14-years-old.  However, you might not recognize her at first glance since (1) she is trimmer, although she still has a bodacious figure; and (2) she's had the pre-mature wrinkles under her eyes surgically removed and her face looks a little different.

Although this is a burlesque of the ""reality"" at your local news station, some of it is strangely real.  For example, the lead story constantly being the latest update on the panda bears at the San Diego Zoo and the media frenzy surrounding them is pretty much true.  Also real was the fanatical insistence by the TV producers (as a means to higher ratings) to feature human interest and crime stories as entertainment for couch potatoes.

One of the funniest bits in the movie is near the beginning when Ron Burgundy tries out his unique pick-up style on Veronica by telling her that she has one very fine rear engine...or words to that effect, and she comes back with something like, ""You sure know how to flatter a girl,"" the sarcasm as heavy as molasses in January at the North Pole.

See this for Will Ferrell, whose over-the-top performance fascinates even when he isn't funny, and just kind of zone out on the dead parts that don't quite make it.",1103414400,3,2989,4.72972972972973

'Anchorman' is almost totally void of any enertainment value for anyone with an IQ above 10.  It is a bad, worthless and inane movie.  I had to give it one star because Amazon does not allow zero or negative stars.

The movie has three very brief redeeming bits... the Indian food in a diaper comment, Christina Applegate in an apron, and the Avengers theme during a fight.  That is it.

Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson should fire their agents or leave Hollywood for good.  Until they learn how to pick a good movie, I will not see anymore movies with either of those three idiots.

Many people have told me to pass this one up, but once I saw it, I have to say that the funny parts are enough to override the stupid/lame parts, which were, essentially, few.

It seems that after a few flops, Will Ferrell has found his niche among the tacky '80s ""newsculture"" where fighting for an anchoring position over a woman is absolutely unheard of. Ferrell plays a smooth-talking, manly anchorman for the top-rated newsstation on network TV. When he discovers that his position is in jeopardy, he realizes that he must fight for what he loves: poetry, long walks on the beach, and his dog, Baxter.

This joyous and often absurd romp through Pleasureland and beyond had me laughing at the many celebrity cameos and crazy plot twists. But you have to admit, that ""Anchorman""'s quotability is close to that of ""Zoolander,"" with incredible lines like, ""You just punted Baxter off the bridge!""

Will ferrell really shines in this movie, so much unexpected stuff like the fight scene.  I now use this movie to judge people i meet.  If they didn't like the movie or didn't get it, i don't even bother with them cause they won't get me.

1544303,3,B00005JMYI,"Will Ferrell is one of the few actors from Saturday Night Live that actually has some talent and will have a very long movie career if he so desires (most of the other SNL actors who could have long movie careers are dead, though).  ANCHORMAN was a movie that Ferrell helped write and his comic touch is all over the screen play.  Ferrell can get laughs, but he also knows when to restrain himself and not play things so over the top. In fact, in some ways Ferrell is one of the most British American comic actors around.

The subtitle of ANCHORMAN is ""The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" because the main character in the story is Burgundy (Ferrell).  Burgundy is the lead anchor for channel 4 news in San Diego during the mid 1970s.  The people of the city love him and he is adored everywhere he goes. But Burgundy lives a very lonely life, spending most of his nights alone at home talking to his dog Baxter.  Burgundy's closest friends are his co-workers from the station: reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), and sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner).  The four friends make a formidable group and are the top rated news team in San Diego.

Burgundy's life changes the day that Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) appears at a Channel 4 party. Burgundy immediately falls for the mysterious woman but she leaves him cold. The next day Burgundy and company learn that the studio heads have hired Corningstone as a bow to the changing times as their newest reporter.  What follows is one bizarre boy meets girl story and a slight warning about romantic relationships in the workplace.

When I first saw the previews for ANCHORMAN, I thought it was going to be a dumb movie like DODGEBALL. However, as noted earlier, Ferrell knows when to draw the line and though there are a few sexual jokes [...],the movie isn't that raunchy. Ferrell, well, Will Ferrell is Will Ferrell and he's a great comedian. Applegate turns in a great performance as the lovestruck/career-ladder climbing Corningstone. Steve Carell steals just about every scene he is as the mentally-challenged Tamland, as does the Burgundy's dog Baxter.

ANCHORMAN has a fun time mixing up movie genres and throwing in pop culture references. In one of the best scenes of the movie, a major gang fight breaks out between the news teams at the 3 major networks, the public broadcast station, and the Hispanic station. During the fight, movie references as varied as PLANET OF THE APES and SPARTACUS are thrown in.  Later in the movie, Baxter, in a Lassie-like moment, saves some people from being ripped to shreds by a ferocious bear. Nevertheless, even with such humorous scenes such as these, ANCHORMAN remains like a typical boy meets girl story.  Keep it classy, San Diego.",1099612800,,2784,4.811320754716981
1544304,4,B00005JMYI,"Will Ferrell comes alive in _Anchorman_, once again proving that he is one of the few talented acts to come out of the SNL machine in quite some time.  Whenever you're watching a comedy whose talent is a bit low on the sophisticated meter, you have to be enthralled by the characters and the actors who play them.  Ferrell delivers in spades and, while the plot spins around and goes nowhere, he manages to continually delight the audience with his own brand of humor.  Bottom line, if you love Will Ferrell and his style of comedy, you will love _Anchorman_.  If you don't, shop elsewhere.

The premise of the film is a hilarious look at the power of reporters during the ""golden age"" of local television.  The character of Ron Burgandy is absolutely hilarious and it is a delight to see a chauvinistic icon struggle with what he views as an invasion by women in the workforce.  My only complaint with the film is the same complaint that I have with many of the comedies that are being released these days.  These comedies seem to be based off quick sketch ideas, many of which are spawned from Saturday Night Live and the like.  The problem with this formula is that many of these sketches are hard to sustain over a couple of minutes, let alone a feature length film.  One gets the impression that these films, including _Anchorman_, would be truly dynamite if they could just restrict themselves to an hour.  The ""90 minute"" comedy rule is just too long for these films to sustain their interest, forcing them to sag at many points.

That being said, _Anchorman_ still receives my approval.  Each time I have seen it, I have been laughing out loud and forced to tears at a few spots.  Will Ferrell's performance is stunning and I think he is truly one of the most gifted comedic actors working these days.",1099526400,,1809,4.560371517027864

When he talks it is hilarious... he can take the most mundane word and make it absolutely the funniest thing you have ever heard!!  I have heard alot people say the movie was way over done... like the fight scene, but the movie made fun of itself...now how great is that.  After the over done and elaborate fight scene Ron and the gang are just sitting in his office making fun of the whole scene in a great sarcastic tone.  People didn't get it.. my friends didn't...they thought it was stupid but it was supposed to be.  They even made that known during the movie!

So it is with great pleasure that I say that ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" starring the great Will Ferrell is by far one of the funniest films I've seen in the past few years, funnier than even Ferrell's other onscreen classic, ""Old School"".

The clothes and the attitude are dead-on parodies of the 70s.  Steve Carrell as the dopey news weatherman who declares, ""I love rug, I love lamp"" when asked if he had ever actually been in love is off the wall hilarious.  The scene with the septor has to be seen to be believed.

Christina Applegate is the only one in over her head here.  She's given a fairly thankless ""straight-woman"" role and does nothing more than read her lines and look attractive, but I doubt anyone else could have done much with the role.

All in all, the jokes come fast and often, with the unrated special edition of the DVD (said to include enough material for a whole other film) surely to add more to this.  Highly recommended.",1098576000,4,1097,4.391089108910891

This is absolutely the worst I've ever seen from any of those folks I mentioned, with the possible exception of Ben Stiller's dismal character in DODGEBALL. The main setting harks back to one of the most better left forgotten eras in American history, when Helen Reddy was more than ready to give us hell, stirring up the cesspools of meaningless dissent, singing ""I am woman, hear me roar"", when the ""sitcom"" was born as a means of dubious entertainment, and men were portrayed as feeble-minded, and women were portrayed as poeple who like to assault the feeble-minded. It was an era that could have gladly come to an end (which it still hasn't completely yet) but this movie is a striking example of something determined to dredge it up and make us live it all over again. The male lead (I won't say hero), in  trying to court the female lead (I won't say heroine), utters a line so stupid it challenges how stupid something can be and still succeed, even in a farce. He says that ""San Diego"" is German for ""whale's vagina"". I am very much up for irreverent humor and certainly no nice Nelly. But when I heard that, I couldn't laugh. I just felt embarrassed to be of the same species that created such an inane attempt at humor. And that was in the relatively reality-grounded part of the movie! From there it shoots off in all different directions of screwball comedy, none of them really working or failing to clash with one another. There's a scene where anchormen from competing stations slash it out medieval-style with a motley assortment of weapons that they pull out of nowhere. That's where most of the cameos come in. We're supposed to find it funny when one guy gets an arm cut off in the brawl! This movie hasn't earned the right to tack on an ending that it would wish to make us care about. It would be better left seething in its own quagmire of manifold impertinancies. But, you guessed it. It puts a cliff-hanger ending on the end like we were supposed to care about its main characters as heroes. During that ending we're supposed to find it funny when the same guy who previously got an arm cut off gets his other arm cut off. Man, is this movie a desperately unfunny kind of ""one-upmanship"" or what? The cliffhanger ending has people falling into a bear pit at a zoo -- people the movie never made us care about before, but we're expected to go along, radically shifting gears into caring about them now. Could one more disparate clashing category of dumb humor be dragged into this mess? Yes! The way the ending is resolved is by a lost dog showing up and having an ability to engage in dialogue with bears!

The other members of the team are Brian Fantana the field reporter, Champ the sports reporter, and Brick the weatherman. Families would sit around the television at night and watch to the news together; there was a connection between Ron and the people of San Diego. Everything was perfect for the channel 4 news team.

Then the unexpected happened, the men with power thought an addition to the news team was important. Veronica Corningstone came to the channel 4 news team and she started up a few disputes among other members of the team. At this time it was which member of the team could get with Veronica. Then after Ron's dog was kicked off of a bridge by an angry biker, Veronica had to step in when Ron did not show up to report the evening news. She performed amazingly and the reviews soared. They wanted more and she was made Co-Anchor. This created drama for the channel 4 news team. Instead of wanting to score, they were concerned of getting her off of the air. Even through many struggles between Ron and Veronica a romance started to blossom.

 Throughout this movie you will notice yourself laughing at almost every scene. This movie feels like your watching a live comedy show, filled with scenes about rivalries between news teams, street fights, immature name-calling and so much more. Upon leaving the movie theater, you will also notice that you are repeating lines from the movie. Because the movie was directed towards the adolescent and young adult age group the quick comebacks and cheesy lines are what helped this movie go to the top.

 If you enjoyed movies such as Zoolander, Old School, Van Wilder, than this is your type of movie. Anchorman is about a two hour comedy made up of improv, clever lines, and quick comebacks. It hooks you to the humor at the beginning and you don't lose interest throughout the entire movie. You are there to laugh and it does an amazing job at this. Some of the present comedic actors appear in this film. The star of the movie is Will Ferrell, and there are appearances by Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, and Luke Wilson who all performed gracefully in a dramatic street fight. Another important guest star is Jack Black his humor is nothing short of what it was in School of Rock in his scene in this movie. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.

This movie had, dare I say ""bright spots,"" but these times came few and very, VERY far between.  The only reason I sat through this entire movie was because it was part of a double feature paired with ""Envy"" (which was actually worse than ""Anchorman."")

I am a big Will Ferrel fan, but he was terrible in this movie.  Ron Burgandy is too much like some of his other characters.  For being the featured actor in this movie, they didn't showcase his talent what-so-ever.  Christina Applegate, not right for this part.  Paul Rudd, whom I usually like, was also bad, athough I think I blame it more on the writing.  I do have to give some props to Steve Carrell who was the funniest, if not the only funny character in this movie.

""Anchorman"" definitely did NOT live up to the hype.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Such as littering, acceptance of sexual harassment, style of clothing, hair and a number of other corny things that we remember from the 70s, even if you weren't alive then.

This is filled with an incredible cast, and pushes satirical humor to the limits. Don't listen to all your idiot friends who says it sucks, just because they didn't get the satire.

1544460,3,B00005JMYI,"Al Franken, Molly Shannon, Chris Farley, Will McDonald, Dana Garvey, Mike Meyers, Adam Sandler, and now Will Ferrell--why do these talented performers dependably crack me up on their SNL 10-minute bits yet leave me constantly looking at my watch during their feature-length movie offerings? Well, for one thing the writing is atrocious--thinly disguised, formulaic soapers with a few ""F"" words and whoopee cushion jokes thrown in to justify the length and venue. Characterization is nil--apparently a viewer's prior familiarity with the on-screen personas is considered sufficient--and plots are mono-dramatic situations used as excuses for lame (and loud) verbal and sight gags.

 In the case of ""Anchorman"" the title says it all. Ferrell plays a vain and fatuous television news anchor whose chief attribute is his hair, which is suddenly under threat by a foxy woman rival with both brains and hair (no matter that the sexist situations and dialogue are at least 30 years out of date). For no reason other than dramatic necessity the two competitive anchors get their act together both romantically and professionally by the end of the movie (which came 60 minutes too late for this viewer).

 Just to show you how short this film is on creative ideas, the highlight for me was the voice-over narration supplied by CBS and cable news commentator Bill Kurtis. A close second would be a 5-second out-take from ""Smokey and the Bandit Part 2."" A 3rd would be Tim Robbins' walk-on as a ruthlessly ambitious PBS rep.

 I'll be curious to to see how well this film does. Pre-college kids probably won't get the political humor of the opening sketches; college kids couldn't care less; adults find SNL humor, at least since the Belushi-Akroyd days, way beneath them. I have a hunch the makers of this film might wish they had chosen to invest their money in something like ""Fear Factor: The Movie.""

 I'm giving the film 3 stars because of Farrell's great comedic potential (he's actually a pretty good musician and dancer) and because he mercifully spared us that noxious cheerleading bit, which is as unfunny as any SNL sketch I've ever seen. Also, his ""in character"" interviews in promoting the film were so subtle he had me believing I was watching some of the anchormen from my youth in northern Wisconsin. Finally, the only other spectator in the theater--my wife--claimed that she liked the movie.",1091491200,,2399,5.010050251256281

1544540,4,B00005JMYI,"Will Ferrell is boldly going where no Saturday Night Live! performer has gone in years ? translated success from the small screen to the big screen! Not since Mike Myers made the move to feature films with Wayne?s World has Hollywood seen such a comedic performer such as Will Ferrell. It isn?t recent that Ferrell has been making appearances in feature films; in fact he made his feature film debut in the Mike Myers comedy, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery in 1997. Since then he has made feature roles and cameos in numerous comedies, none of which have made anything beyond a few million dollars of their production budgets. It wasn?t until 2003 when Ferrell appeared in two surprise smash-hits, Old School and Elf, and decided to leave Saturday Night Live! Since then he has become of the most sought after comedic stars in Hollywood, receiving offers both left and right and there appears to be no sign of him slowing down anytime soon.

As with most sketch comedy films, the story doesn?t matter as much to the audience as the laughs are all that seem to matter but Anchorman at least attempts, unlike so many others, to the plot it starts off with. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy takes movie-goers back to the 1970s when Ron Burgundy was San Diego?s top-rated news anchor and only men were allowed to read the news. But the times are changing and when an ambitious female reporter, Veronica Corningstone, comes to the Channel 4 newsroom, Ron?s world begins to change and not to his liking. At first, Veronica is given ?female? oriented interest stories, like cat fashion shows, and is kept out the lime-light for the most part. But one day, Ron fails to show up to report the news on time and Veronica takes his place, only to receive her big break and become co-anchor. Things just continue to get worse the more Ron fights the fact that he is no longer San Diego?s top anchorman. The story for Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy may not be the most accurate representation of the era at the time but it does manage to touch on some issues, as in the rise of feminism, that were of importance in the 1970s, although the film does not take them as seriously as they were in real life. But bottom-line is that film plays for laughs and nothing presented in this film should be taken seriously, except perhaps the representation of news anchors that are often seen on the local news today.

The cast of Anchorman consists of mainly of actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live!, whether they be current or former members, as well as several others that are well accustomed to sketch comedy of this nature. Will Ferrell, who proved to Hollywood that he was comedic driving force to be reckoned with thanks to his holiday smash-hit, Elf, owns the show as the title character, Ron Burgundy. This film proves to many that Ferrell is one of the best comedic minds in the business today as he is able to turn even the dumbest material into something funny ? it may not be gut-busting but it doesn?t come off as stupid as it should, which is all that matters to move the film along. Christina Applegate performs reasonably in the role of Veronica Corningstone, the female newswoman who threatens Ron Burgundy?s news world. It wasn?t that she doesn?t work well in the film; there are severely scenes between her and Will Ferrell that are particularly funny. The problem is that most of the material given to her isn?t as funny as it should be. Often she is too dependant on someone like Will Ferrell to help make the scene humorous and when it comes to a scene by herself, it doesn?t have the same impact as the rest of the film. David Koechner?s Champ Kind, the sports reporting cowboy, is one of the bigger disappointments and becomes a character that should have been entirely cut from the film as his material is more trite and annoying then anything else. Steve Carell?s Brick Tamland, the mentally retarded weatherman, is one of the biggest highlights of the film and, yes, there is a jab at the Bush administration with his character (what kind of Hollywood production would it be without one of those?) but other then that, he draws some of the biggest laughs of the film. And what would a comedy such as this be without celebrity cameos? Though many of the jokes of Anchorman don?t live up to other comedies, this is one area where it probably rises above anything else in the past few years, including the opening segment of Austin Powers in Goldmember. Without giving away anything, pay attention to the street-fight sequence or you may miss someone.

Overall, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is dumb, immature, and lacks the consistency and technique of vastly superior comedies of the past such as Austin Powers but in a summer severely lacking in anything remotely humorous, it does the job its meant to do, making us laugh, even if years from now it will be long forgotten. One of the film?s main problems is that there isn?t anything excessively amusing. There are certain parts of the film that are certainly humorous, most notably the street-fight sequence between the numerous news teams, but they are few and far between. For the most part Anchorman relies on monotonous toilet humor that becomes old and tired the more they use it. It doesn?t get to the point where it makes the film intolerable but it does graze the line a bit. Another problem wasn?t what was seen but rather it was the material that wasn?t shown in the comedy. Remember the film?s trailer? Some of the trailer?s more entertaining moments don?t make into the film (?Well, I?m getting a divorce and I may never see my kids again? ? ?Fantastic!?) but according to the film?s director, he ended up with about four hours worth of material which may all end up on a special edition DVD when its released later this year. The point is, despite those minor complaints, Anchorman is a pure, dumb comedy that doesn?t expect to be anything more then entertaining, even if it fails to be all that memorable. In a year that has certainly lacked its share of quality comedies, let alone decent ones, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is one class act and worth the price of admission this summer.",1090454400,2,6206,4.6657534246575345
1544541,4,B00005JMYI,"Will Ferrell's star is on the rise. With hits like ""Elf"", ""Old School"", and now ""Anchorman"" under his belt he seems to have made a life for himself beyond ""Saturday Night Live"". Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, the number one news anchor in San Diego in the 1970s, who is somewhat of a living legend in the area. He is the face that everyone looks to for the news. Enter Veronica Corningstone (Applegate), a woman with high aspitations, and a determination that set off a war between herself and Burgundy. She wasn't to be an anchor, and he does not see how a woman can do what he does. When fate steps in, and Bergundy finds himself late for a broadcast, he finds his world turned upside down as Corningstone fills in for him...and does well.

 ""Anchorman"" is a very satirical look at the news world of the 1970s as women are trying to break into a man's game. Will Ferrell disappears into Ron Burgundy, and carries the movie completely. The supporting case (along with a few surprise cameos) lend their own quirkyness to the supporting characters. If the previews looked funny to you, you will enjoy this movie.

1544632,3,B00005JMYI,"MOVIE: This movie is just one big SNL skit made feature lengthed. The movie I compared this most to was Dodgeball. I was looking for similarities and differences between the two and unfortunetly found more similarities. Even though Will Ferrel co-wrote the movie it didn't really click. What I liked was that many of the jokes had a reference to something and even if they were random they still had some part in what was going on at the time during the scene. Dodgeball lacked hilarity because none of the jokes had a reference they were just blurbs of utter stupidity. This movie is not only making fun of the 70's era it makes fun of the news, jazz lounges, street gangs, men, and the rest of the jokes fall under the random category. What really hurts the movie is that the jokes are forced. Everyone in the audience will probably laugh in sync because all the jokes in this movie are physical comedy. Everything that you laugh at will be visually provoked. If you think about it, nothing that the characters say is funny. Imagine the ""glass case of emotion"" scene without Ferrel flopping around and crying hysterically. See! The laughs are forced but so goes with SNL, so it is a very enjoyable movie, but the second time around you won't laugh.

 ACTING: Will Ferrel is Will Ferrel. His acting is the same as it was on SNL and even more similar to Zoolander. He is big, loud, and funny. Nothing new, just the same ol' Will that we love. Steve Carell (The Daily Show, Bruce Almighty) is the funniest guy in the movie. He plays the dumbfounded weatherman who makes the funniest cracks throughout the movie. I feel that he was the only real thing that worked perfectly in the movie, you didn't get tired of him but you didn't miss him either. The cameos in this movie were actually ""cameos"". Dodgeball had the stupidest cameos ever, and they were so pointless. Will Ferrel invites some of his buddies including past co-stars Vince Vaugn, Luke Wilson, and Ben Stiller to join the fun as well as some familiar faces from SNL. The cast is fun no doubt about it.

 BOTTOM LINE: You will laugh at the movie, but the laughs are very forced and seeing it the second time around will be dull. Today's comedies are starting to become so repetitive and it makes me wonder if comediens like Peter Sellers, Mel Brooks, John Candy, Bill Murray, and other greats will ever have an influence on future comediens.",1090368000,,2400,4.561484918793504

1544721,3,B00005JMYI,"Will Ferrell is an acquired taste.  You either get it or you don't. Much of what he does in ""Anchorman"" reminds me a lot of Bill Murray's moves; but Murray's moves one step removed. Ferrell's shtick is a hit and miss situation: sometimes it works, other times not.
Nonetheless, there are a couple of hilarious scenes in ""Anchorman"": the ""Westside Story"" meets ""Braveheart"" hand-to-hand combat scene between all the San Diego News teams is one. Also, Christina Applegate is smart, sexy and pretty and more to the point she is becoming quite the accomplished comedic actress.
Ultimately, ""Anchorman"" is not as smart, funny and witty that it thinks it is...but hey---maybe that's the point.",1089849600,4,687,5.026315789473684
1544722,4,B00005JMYI,"That might seem like a stupid title for a review but I think I'll explain.  I have never been a huge fan of Farrell.  I think he is good at improvasation but loves to play it over the top, which ruins the humor for me.  In Anchorman, he played it just right, no over the top in this and he was very very funny.
If Amazon would allow me to give half stars I would of given this three and a half.  A very enjoyable comedy.  I disagree with the reviewer that says that it should of had an R rating.  I really respect movies that can are funny without relying on ""how many times can we say a swear word"" type humor.
A very enjoyable movie that delivered what it promises.
As a side note to the person that said that stuff that wasn't in the movie was in the trailer.  A trailer is usually made before the final version of a film is cut, so a lot of that stuff could of been on the cutting room floor.  I hope you don't see trailers and want to go see exactly what you saw in the trailers.  The trailer is to make you want to see the movie, not a promise of what is going to be in the movie.",1089849600,2,1086,3.8778280542986425

I smiled at some of the jokes, while the rest of the crowd at the theater HOWLED with laughter at every single joke, seemingly just to laugh. This is one of those stupid-humor movies like ""Scary Movie"", but not as extreme. And like ""Scary Movie"", ""Anchorman"" gets old fast, and therefore gets very boring.

1544725,4,B00005JMYI,"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is a hilarious comedy with a great cast that shouldn't be missed.  In early 1970's San Diego, anchorman, Ron Burgundy, and his news team are on top.  The whole city loves them as they continue to hold the top spot in the ratings(Super duper!).  However, just when everything seems to be going the right way, a female anchor/field reporter, Veronica Corningstone, is hired.  Burgundy and his news team will stop at nothing to get rid of Corningstone so that the Channel 4 news office can return back to normal.  Not everyone will enjoy this type of humor, but if you're a fan of Will Ferrell, you will love this movie.  Plenty of off-the-wall humor, too many great lines to even mention, and some of the worst hairstyles you'll ever see.  One particularly hilarious scene, with some great cameos, has Burgundy and Co. duking it out with all the other channel's news teams in a no-holds barred street fight.  Not all the jokes work, but the ones that do are hysterical.  Highly recommended comedy about a different time that will have you rolling around.
  Will Ferrell is hilarious as chauvinistic Channel 4 in San Diego anchorman, Ron Burgundy.  His character, even when arrogant and cocky, is still likable.  He fully embodies the man who reads from the teleprompter without thinking, which ends up getting him in trouble.  Christina Applegate is also very good as co-anchor, Veronica Corningstone, who tries to survive in a male-dominated news office.  The rest of the news team includes Paul Rudd as ladies man and field reporter, Brian Fantana, Steven Carell in a great part as weatherman, Brick Tambland, who has an IQ of 48, and David Koechner as sports anchor, Champ Kind.  The always funny Fred Willard plays Ed Harken, the head of the news office.  I won't say who the cameos are because it is so funny to see them in their parts, much of the time unexpectedly.  I can't wait to see the DVD for Anchorman for all the deleted scenes, outtakes, and hopefully a lot more.  Be forewarned, many of the scenes in the trailer airing on TV did not make it into the final cut, but the version shown is still great.  For a hilarious movie with a great performance by Will Ferrell, check out Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.",1089676800,57,2266,4.688607594936709
1544726,3,B00005JMYI,"Yes, Anchorman is supposed to be a silly movie and it is. But, i went into the theater so much more. It really wasn't as funny as i hoped. I think Will Ferrel is a comedic genius, but i didn't think this film showcased his talent very well. Here a few Cliff's Notes versions on why it wasn't great. 1. The cameos weren't maxamized as they should've been 2.it just wasn't that funny 3. the actual movie omitted A LOT of stuff from the trailer 4. the sports guy isn't funny at all (equal comedy between all anchormen would've been better besides the film's namesake) 5. the conclusion of the movie isn't silly, it's stupid 6.and Afternoon Delight could've been taken so much further.
I am not trying to bash the film. There were some funny moments. I really enjoyed the weatherman and the field reporter characters. I like the idea that the stars ad-libbed.
I just wish the movie was funnier. Stupid comedy is supposed to be very stupid, but it is also supposed to be funny.",1089676800,4,972,4.466292134831461

1544728,5,B00005JMYI,"for those of you that thought this movie was too ""silly"" or ""ridiculous"" allow me to remind you that it is a comedy, a genre which generally attempts to make people laugh. i agree that this is not will ferrells best dramatic performance, too many laughs. the movie is remarkably original and ferrell and steve carell (who plays brick tamlin) make the movie themselves. and for those of you that cant take the punting of a stuffed dog, you have a whole other set of problems besides this movie. plus christina applegate is really hot. this movie may not be like your flawless comedies like The Royal Tenenbaums or A Mighty Wind, but for those people who like to laugh and enjoy happiness, this is a good one",1089590400,,706,4.5234375
1544729,2,B00005JMYI,"This film was terribly unfunny. It tried way too hard. It had absolutely no plot or any kind of motivation for any of the characters. The supporting cast was extremely dull and uninspired. Will Ferrell was on auto-pilot, playing a pompous uncharismatic lead character, who gives us no reason to root for him or like him at all. Christina applegate was terrible. It had some good moments, but over all it just wasn't funny enough.
Why does an audience of 2004, give a rats patoot about a woman becoming an anchorman? I know it takes place IN the 70's, but the audience of today doesn't care about those issues anymore. Yet the film used it for its only mild plot device. What a waste.
I can't believe this film actually has a script. Ron's team was so over the top. The sports guy was never funny. The guy from daily show, was a waste. Its too easy to throw in a character like that for cheap laughs. The last guy again, not one good joke.
I wanted more stories about the rival studios, and less of the crap of a 70's news station getting a female anchor for 90 damn minutes.",1089590400,18,1074,4.348258706467662
1544799,3,B00005JMYI,"Anchorman is the story of Ron Burgandy, top anchorman in San Diego in the 1970's. Burgandy, played by Ferrell, heads the top news team in San Diego. The 4 men that make up the team are sexist and egotistical, thinking that women bow to them. This is evident when Ron uses pick-up lines such as ""Do you know who I am? You should. I'm famous, people know me."" The Channel 4 news team has it good as the #1 rated news team until their boss decides to add some diversity to the team by bringing in a woman, Veronica Corningstone (played by Christina Applegate). The crew is outraged that a woman is being allowed to do a man's job, and what ensues is a battle between Ron and Veronica over who is a better anchor. Eventually Veronica gets Ron fired accidentally, and Ron goes into a 3 month depression (where he is always drinking milk) until only he can be called on to report the biggest story of the year. To add to all of this, the team has to compete with other news stations around San Diego. To me the funniest part in this movie was the fight scene among all of the local stations, including the public access channel. Here we get cameos from Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller (anchor for the Spanish news station!) and in other parts Jack Black appears. There are many great moments in this movie, with some good catch phrases to boot. I just didn't think this came together as a complete movie. Another reviewer said it was like a long SNL skit and I could not agree more. Overall I don't think this is a great movie but you should see it anyway. It has a lot of crazy lines in it that will crack you up for most of the movie, but isn't that what you would expect from a movie with a comedian as crazy as Will Ferrell is?",1089504000,9,1732,4.251515151515152
1544800,1,B00005JMYI,"I won't go into much detail about this movie.  It's boring and stupid and rarely draws a laugh.  But even the idle laughter ended when Jack Black punted Will Ferrell's dog off a bridge.  Yeah, hilarious stuff.  Animal cruelty is always a real knee slapper.  Bet people will be lining up to see that.
I guess that the dog comes back alive in the end is supposed to redeem it, but kicking a dog off a bridge is never going to be funny.  I hope every animal lover even tempted to see this movie avoids this movie like the plague.
The scene was very shocking and I guess that's how it was supposed to derive the laugh, but a few weeks ago People magazine ran an article about some kid who kicked his neighbor's dog like a football and is facing deserved criminal charges for animal cruelty.  So I'm sure another idiot kid somewhere will see this movie and go out imitating it for a joke.  Ha, ha.  Nice going guys.
Minus that scene, this movie is still terrible.  Save your money.",1089504000,8,976,4.313186813186813

1544803,3,B00005JMYI,"Will Ferrell is probably the hottest and most in demand comedian in movies right now and deservingly of course.  He is an amazingly funny person.  He just sends of that impression of being an old creepy guy that uses stupid pick-up lines on girls and tries to hang out with the younger crowd.  Almost anything that he does turns out funny.  Well, except for this movie.
Anchorman is about a new anchorman named Ron Burgundy (Ferrell).  His station is the number 1 rated news broadcast in the San Diego area.  Ron Burgundy is a sexist, extremely cocky person who is always trying to hook up with girls by saying ""You know, I am famous.""  Along with the rest of his news team, all of them being male, they strut around town and are well known by everyone.  Well, the management at Channel 4, Ron's station, decides that they need a change and hire a female news reporter.  This does not sit well with Ron and the rest of the news team.  So after a brief relationship with the new female broadcaster (Christina Applegate), Ron decides to try to destroy her career.  This backfires against him and he becomes scum and then rises back to the top.  Enough said.
Now don't get me wrong, this movie had its funny moments.  The cameos by Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Jack Black (whose cameo turned out to be the funniest moment of the movie) were really good.  Steve Carrell was the funniest of Burgundy's news team.  The problem is that the movie felt like a really long SNL skit that started to get old after about 20 minutes.  During most of the movie, the audience was not laughing.  The movie had a lot of dry parts and moved at a much slower pace then, say, Dodgeball.  This wasen't a bad movie, its just wasen't what I was hoping for.",1089417600,,1747,4.440251572327044
1544804,4,B00005JMYI,"Will Ferrell is back in another silly movie.  This time it works.  Although, Ferrell is not the one getting all of the laughs.  No no, this anchorman better believe there is no I in team because he is lost without them.
The story begins with a little telling of the legend of an anchorman named Ron Burgundy (Ferrell).  His news team includes Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), Champ Kind (David Koechner), and Brick Tamland (Steven Carell).  This foursome brings the San Diego news to people every night.  Oh, and Burgundy is a five time Emmy winner for his desk job.
All is working great.  The teamwork, cohesiveness, fun, and high-spirits are in full gear.  Then, a threat arrives.  Oh no, it's a woman named Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate).  Corningstone is quick to find herself in the same situation that she has faced in past experiences.  Nobody feels that a woman is capable for anything except something for eyes to feast on.
It turns out, that Burgundy and Corningstone share more than a professional relationship with each other.  This leads Bugundy turning his team into a quartet to sing about love.  One of the cooler parts of the film.  However, this relationship is ruined when Corningstone takes over the desk job and Burgundy loses his job.  To not ruin the movie, I will not discuss the details that lead up to this moment.
However, in the end, the whole team must figure out a way to catch the biggest story of the summer, which involves a panda giving birth at the San Diego Zoo.  What would  a movie be without competition?  Not only must the team compete with itself, but also other news stations.  Who will win???
As the title shows, Anchorman would be nothing without the supporting cast.  Sure, Ferrell has some good one-liners and funny moments, but it doesn't compare to some other parts that the other people provide.  For instance, at the beginning, they show the opening segment of how the news begins by introducing all of the sections of the news.  To see Paul Rudd walk in to the shot and start strutting was funny in itself.
Christina Applegate has grown up from the Kelly Bundy era.  She in no longer a dumb, pretty, blonde girl; she is a smart, pretty, blonde girl that likes the news.  Her prescence not only made the news better, it made the film better.  She was definitely able to hold her own in the mixture of all the boys.
The best character in the movie has to go to Steven Carell's Brick.  Brick mentions he has an I.Q. somewhere in the 40s, and it shows.  They made this character into a really stupid person, but that is totally ok.  He made me and the rest of the audience laugh more than anything.  Remember the scene in Bruce Almighty where Bruce makes the anchorman do really crazy things?  Well, that's who Steven Carell is.  Here, he is used to perfection.
To me, the best scene in the movie involved a brawl between news teams from different channels.  This scene has a lot of cameos in it.  The main thing is the amount of laughs.  My eyes were seriously watering because I was laughing so much during this 5 to 6 minute segment and few minutes following.  It was that good.
Another good scene involves Ron's dog (yet another great supporting member that saves the film).  It involves the dog having a conversation with a Kodiak bear.  My friend thought this was the best part of the movie.  I will have to agree that is was funny, although, my laughter may have been towards laughing at him for laughing so hard.  Either way, it's still funny.
There were parts in the film that were not to my liking.  For instance, there was like this dream sequence that looked like something from an Adam Sandler movie.  There was also a few dry spots were it is just Ron that are kind of dull.  However, that is not enough to not recommend this film.  Overall, it was a funny movie.  If anything, go to see Steven Carell as Brick.  He's one of the characters that are supposed to be stupid and could either be seen as annoying or great.  Luckily, it worked out for the best.",1089417600,3,4023,4.525
