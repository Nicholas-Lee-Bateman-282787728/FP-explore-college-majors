200748,5,1596686847,"Have learned so much from this DVD about watercolor portraits I never even considered in my extensive career as an artist.  Mary, though not from the South, does a stellar and detailed presentation of techniques she has found successful in capturing the essence of a people and the culture.  In doing so, she has opened the door for me to pursue the area where I now live, but was not raised, and has given me insights into looking for those defining details that makes people from a certain area 'come alive' on the paper/canvas and reflect their culture and the background of this particular area.  She has shared some really amazing secrets in this DVD, and I highly recommend it to any artist using watercolor and trying to illustrate people from particular areas.  Don't just limit your understanding of her techniques of painting peoples of the Southern region of the U.S., but expand it to fit what you need for where you are living.  Just an outstanding, detailed and interesting presentation of one artist's take on using watercolors to bring to life people and their comfortable surroundings.",1357084800,3,1102,4.871657754010696
