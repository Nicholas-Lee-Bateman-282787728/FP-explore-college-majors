642911,5,6303425526,"I saw this film in the theatre and was bowled over by the raw, nervy performance of Sarah Miles. She was incredible--more like a frayed violin string than something human. The art direction is sometimes breathtaking, sometimes a little too 1970's but it always works. Richard Chamberlain's ""Lord Byron"" is awe-inspiring and Margaret Leighton can freeze San Antonio with with one lift of her eyebrow, but Jon Finch really keeps the film anchored to the deep tragedy that befalls his wife and his political career.",1124755200,3,512,5.035294117647059
642912,5,6303425526,"I saw this film in a moment of illness which created delirious openness, and was completely floored. Theatrical and magnificent, like a piece of kabuki theater, mask-like and stylized, and yet quite visceral and immediate. Exquisite period costumes and settings, and a palpable sense of movement throughout. For example, the opening sequence shows Lady Caroline galloping impetuously over the moors, so English, so exciting, then dismounting and running through the halls, bursting through the doors, and saying breathlessly, ""He has proposed!"" Such a great way to show that the character is impatient, romantic, restless, maybe a little mad or at least a bit uncontrollable. Wonderful concise strokes like this throughout, as when Lord Byron is shown first as a kind of savage boxing a negro man for his supper. He is shown first to be brutal, sensual, earthy, before we know he is a great poet.

A rare period of film history, when the production values were still very high and formal, but the acting and stories were becoming  more immediate and raw. The film is thematic rather than narrative in purpose. It carries the story more with ""mood"" than with plot, which is very cinematic and quite poetic. Sometimes historical facts are altered to create a better montage, which as a filmmaker I completely agree with. No boring biopic here.

Gorgeous color photography, wonderful handling of crowd scenes (there is an interesting look into the rousing early 19th century Parliament), and stellar acting by Sarah Miles, Jon Finch, and Richard Chamberlain. Chamberlain is a startling figure, almost obscenely handsome and flaunting it; Finch is a sultry dandy, oh so pouty and a little dark and unsettling; Miles is all eyes, cropped boyish hair, and fabulous unconventional weirdness. At one point she dons blackface and male drag to play Byron's page, and she carries giant feathers to fan him; it is almost too much. It makes one nostalgic not so much for the early 19th century as for the late 1960's. A perfect story to film then, when the oddness and androgeny of Miles' character and the frills and dandy sexiness of the men paralleled so well the new gender types of the late 60's. Quite an experience for a dog day Tuesday afternoon.",1094083200,7,2241,4.9866310160427805
642913,5,6303425526,"This is based on the story of Lady Lamb. She is a woman with strong emotions and at the beginning of the story is shown to have to take some concoction to quell her stridency. The actress, Sarah Miles, is outstanding. I felt like I was going through all the same emotions when I watched her act. Her need to be loved by someone who couldn't truly love. She had love but it was not enough. Her husband truly loved her but she pushed him away, distancing herself by their differentness. He was more logical and self-controlled as opposed to Lady Lambs excessive outpouring of whatever she was experiencing at the time. When she started the affair with Lord Byron, she couldn't care less for anyone, she gives into her feelings and forgets everything around her. Nothing matters but her expression. Yes, she was narcissitic but sad, very sad. She wanted the world to understand her emotions to accept passion at its extreme. Of course, this was not acceptable and still isn't. Her only rock was her husband who stood by her at all costs. This was so tenderly heartbreaking and I was touched moreso than many movies I have seen. And believe I have seen a whole lot. It is not an uplifting film and involves a scandal that ends in tragedy. It is very grating on the nerves, it is raw emotion that is acted out brilliantly by Miles. I hope you like it!

642914,5,6303425526,"I love this video/movie.  Actually I had seen it before and loved the story, based on true life story of Lady Caroline Lamb, and her husband, Irish Minister, Charles Lamb.  This is a wanton love story of the love affair of Lady Caroline Lamb and Lord Byron, and the degradation she suffered when she was no longer first in his eyes.  The actors are fabulous, and Sylvia Miles is perfect in the part, and Richard Chamberlain as the handsome Lord Byron.  Sir Laurence Olivier is the Duke of Wellington, and Margaret Leighton Lady Caroline Lamb's mother in law. This was the most notorious cabinet-level sex scandal of the 19th Century, and well worth watching.  It is such a sad story too of ""hell hath no fury of a woman scorned"".",1025308800,8,729,4.576923076923077
643028,5,6303425526,The story of Lady Caroline Lamb is fascinating and true.  Especially loved Sarah Miles and Richard Chamberlain in their roles,1402444800,,125,5.25
643029,4,6303425526,"I purchased this movie 'Lady Caroline Lamb' as I remembered seeing the film some time ago, having found the story very moving.  Lady Caroline's love affair with Lord Byron and her despair, guilt and regret after it ended are portrayed superbly by Sarah Miles, Richard Chamberlain and Jon Finch with distinctive supporting roles by Sir Laurence Olivier and Margaret Leighton. This time there was sympathy for Lady Caroline again and a better understanding of how she was punished in terms of being a political liability to her husband. However, there was impetuous behaviour that was not really explained -her trip to Paris to visit Wellington. The performance of Margaret Leighton as the manipulative unfeeling mother-in-law rather overshadowed the poignancy of Lady Caroline's broken heart and lonely death.
Unfortunately, as the movie is an old one the quality detracted a little from the viewing.",1399852800,2,899,5.286713286713287
643030,2,6303425526,"This DVD looks like the source material was a VCR videotape--it is fullscreen, and every bit as blurry as when I source my video from my VCR.

Not a great film by any means, but there are worse ways of spending 90 minutes.  A better transfer, a better script, or better acting would have been very nice.  Certainly not worth the $20 that Amazon is charging (not by a long shot), but if you can buy it used at a steep discount (at least 1/2 off), you could do worse.",1361923200,5,465,4.144444444444445
643031,3,6303425526,"Hard to enjoy it despite a number of quality actors. (John Mills's, Margaret Leighton's, and Ralph Richardson's performances were well done; Chamberlain's character was just a difficult one for me to enjoy). It isn't a comfortable theme, although it is worth contemplating. Sarah's totally out-of-period hair and initial costume continually distracted much of what insight I would have had into her character.",1314144000,2,409,5.612903225806452
643032,1,6303425526,"Whatever the virtues of this as film, the transfer to DVD is so poor as to render it virtually unwatchable. As another reviewer noted, this film is blurred to the point that it hurts the viewer's eyes. It seems to be a sort of celluloid version of Impressionism. Some scenes are so dark that they are reminiscent of the most recent two Harry Potter disasters, which were too dark to see even in theaters. Wait for a better version, presuming there might be one.",1304553600,16,461,4.5

643034,3,6303425526,"Only bought this because of Richard Chamberlain who does a dashing Byron but his role is so small. The lead actress hams it so much and is so irritating, it is not difficult to believe that Byron tired of her so quickly and easily.",1234051200,2,231,4.2727272727272725
643035,1,6303425526,"I regret to say it, but I must: Don't even consider purchasing this film, on the American DVD format. There's a VERY obvious blurred, soft focus fuzziness throughout every frame. Images you know that should be clear and defined, become strangely marred- from the course hewn textured stone walls of a palatial mansion, to the soft elegant fabrics of the costumes. Trees and landscapes appear as watercolors in the rain. Even the faces don't look right, and try as I did to enjoy the movie, I just couldn't. How bad is the uncorrected picture? I stopped it after watching less than 10 minutes.
  If you've ever seen MGM, Paramount, Universal, Columbia, Warner Brothers or other studios classic films on DVD, you immediately appreciate the crispness and clarity of the moving images. (Most of the time; MGM did a terrible job on Camille with Greta Garbo, for example.) I wanted so much to enjoy this film, since I didn't see it when it was first released. I was looking forward to watching an Epic in the Grand Style, but instead I saw celluloid as reflected in a puddle of standing water.
  I'll have to look into the PAL versions of the film, in hopes that I'll get the movie I want to view. Until then, to spare Amazon shoppers disappointment, I've issued this warning: Think twice before buying this, and then save your money for something you can actually SEE!",1200528000,48,1363,4.690376569037657
643036,3,6303425526,"Lady Caroline Lamb isn't nearly as bad as its reputation, but it's still more troubled than any film has a right to be. Making his one and only foray in the director's chair, writer-director Robert Bolt's take on a famous society scandal may take as many liberties with history as Cecil B. De Mille, but he has a good eye for visuals and a good ear for witty dialogue. Sadly, he has little control of either his narrative or his characters. It's hard to tell how much of the film's unevenness is down to the heavy pre-release cutting, but it's easier to see why it fails so often.

No matter how much her off screen antics may have made her seem an ideal choice, Sarah Miles (then Mrs Bolt) delivers a performance of such fearless ineptitude that it is staggering to watch - sometimes painful, often laughable, always wrong in every way imaginable and frequently expressing every emotion as if she was suffering an extremely uncomfortable attack of indigestion. It's as if a monochrome Looney Tunes cartoon version of Samantha Morton had just had a giant rock dropped on her head and was wondering around in a daze, delivering her lines while counting the little birdies circling her head (her big mad scene is worthy of the East Cheam Dramatic Society on a particularly bad day). Bolt must have been very much in love not to see how disastrously she undoes his best efforts here. Margaret Leighton's archly hostile mother-in-law, Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier phoning in their performances and even John Mills' bland professionalism cannot help but shine by comparison. As her unfortunate husband, Jon Finch struggles in his poorly defined early scenes but makes the most of his later opportunities, but the film's saving grace comes from a most unlikely source - Richard Chamberlain. His Bad Lord Byron is a remarkable star turn, a prototype sexually ambiguous 70s glam rock star (at one point he even models his vocal delivery on Bowie) revelling in the sexual opportunities his newfound infamy presents. It doesn't hurt that he has the best scenes and knows how to act the matin&eacute;e idol, either.

But otherwise it's a film of incidental pleasures - Richard Rodney Bennett's superb score and Oswald Morris' excellent widescreen photography chief among them. If only Bolt had cast a real actress...

For those wary of Jef's reputation for poor DVDs, the PAL Australian DVD is in the film's original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio and boasts a good transfer but no extras.",1198886400,17,2480,4.885985748218527
643037,1,6303425526,"Dreadful transfer to DVD and video. What a shame! Not even widescreen. Clear as mud. A one of a kind romantic film with great performances by Sarah Miles, Richard Chamberlain, Laurence Olivier and Margaret Leighton. Can't anyone help?",1194652800,24,234,5.184210526315789

husband because he truly loves his wild Croline and puts up with her antics; he even gives her the go ahead with her adventures, but to use  discreation. The soundtrack still seems intack, a bit shrill, so lower the volumn a bit.  Maybe someone in the industry will take this task to heart and carefully restore it.
