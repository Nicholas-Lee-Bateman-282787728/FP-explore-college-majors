If you like the cartoon Foghorn Leghorn you have to see this.",1224288000,,107,4.142857142857143
428676,1,6302112052,The quality of this DVD is not good at all.  I ordered another one from another source and it is much better quality.,1213920000,,117,4.086956521739131
428677,5,6302112052,"Funny to watch a northerner playing a southern gentleman and a truly original character. Sorry to find out what Warner Bros did to him after they developed Foghorn Leghorn cartoon character. Obviously Kenny Delmar was no, I say, no Groucho Marx to put those carpetbaggers in their place. His character will live on with the South even though he was no southern planter, that is.",1194912000,,378,4.8307692307692305
428678,5,6302112052,"Kenny Delmar's voice from the Fred Allen show comes alive on the screen.  If you're over 60 you may enjoy the nostalgic re-connection with a ""character"" from the history of radio comedy shows.  If not over 60, and below 30 maybe it'll do you good to step out of the electronic ""cell"" you're surrounded by and see what the old days were like.

THey weren't perfect, all of who are from 60-70 and above know that.  But they were fun, no political correctness was known then, perhaps that's too bad but the foibles of both halves are poked fun at in a way that would do the Klan a lot of good to take to heart.",1181520000,2,607,4.206896551724138
428679,3,6302112052,"The character Kenny Delmar plays in this movie--Senator Clanghorn--was one he initially created for radio audiences. More notably, it's the character on which Warner Brothers (and Mel Blanc) later based the cartoon rooster Foghorn Leghorn. Always a Foghorn fan, I was interested in the origin of the character, and bought a VHS version of the movie some years ago. It sports an engaging (if contrived) plot, designed as a vehicle for allowing Delmar to bring his blustery, conniving character to the screen.",1088121600,3,507,5.195121951219512
428680,4,6302112052,"A humoristic and extreme vision of the South confronted to the invasion of the Yankees. But a strange vision indeed. No Blacks what so ever. A clean white South, just as some would have liked it to be and as it has never existed. This enables the director to show Yankee villains since they only have one objective : to conquer and govern this rebellious South. But it is hilarious in many ways and there are some elements that are good. The trick to make old teetotallers drink alcohol is banal. But the dog is very good and has been well trained, just like these Southeners who become supermen when they hear their Southern national anthem. If you are nostalgic about a past that did not exist and if you are not concerned by unreality then you will find this story amusing.

7821590,5,6302112052,"Love this old film!  Although it is a short one,  and although it is not the best movie ever made,  it is sooo much FUN to hear the ORIGINAL version of what later became ""Foghorn Leghorn"" in those famous cartoons!",1509753600,,213,4.275
7821591,5,6302112052,A classic for the ages. A must watch during the political season.,1463961600,,65,4.5
7821592,4,6302112052,"In 1945 the radio show Burns and Allen: George Burns and Gracie Allen to you youngsters introduced the Character of Senator Beauregard Claghorn, voiced by Kenny Delmar. That character is pretty much the entire reason for this movie. The same character will be immortalized as the cartoon Foghorn Leghorn.

Bottom Line: Lightest of lightweight humor. A very young June Lockhart and some other people do various things so that the not yet senator and his dog can have a movie. By the numbers we have a little romance, some fun with elderly ladies, a comedic dog, a young neighbor boy who does not know booze from fruit juice and generally a set of set ups for the star to turn into jokes. It starts strong with all the asides that make the overbearing, kindly Claghorn worth watching. The introduction of thugs (from Yankee land of course) is supposed to add some dramatic tension. Mostly the drama is forced and some of the jokes predictable. Never mind this is a good time, family friendly, and the way they used to make them.
The best advice is from Beauregard himself: If your listening you're laughing, laughing that is.",1439337600,,1123,4.729591836734694
7821593,3,6302112052,"Corny. It's the origin of the Foghorn Leghorn character in Warner Brothers cartoons. It's interesting that although June Lockhart stars in the movie, she doesn't take credit for it in her bio.",1428364800,,192,5.03125

7821595,5,6302112052,haven't watched it yet but saw it on TV years ago. Always liked all those characters on Fred Allens show.,1409961600,,105,4.3
7821596,5,6302112052,How can you not enjoy Senator Claghorn? Funny funny stuff.,1407974400,,58,4.9
7821597,5,6302112052,This movie is the inspiration for the foghorn leghorn cartoon. I was born the year this movie was made. The Senator is over the top as a southerner. I cracked up.,1390435200,,162,4.258064516129032
7821598,5,6302112052,"Many moons ago, when radio ruled home entertainment and television was a laboratory novelty, there was a man named Fred Allen, who hosted a popular, somewhat satirical, comedy/variety show. After the War, he hired a gentleman by the name of Kenny Delmar as the announcer for the show, and Mr. Delmar soon created a character of his own who became an overnight sensation: Senator Claghorn, a loudmouth, brash, blustering Southern gentleman, very Southern, who would declaim that there was no ""North,"" only ""South, Deep South,and not South enough!"" If this character sounds vaguely familiar, than you have either heard The Fred Allen Show, or you watched enough Loony Toons to recognize a rooster named Foghorn Leghorn. Yes, Foghorn was based off of Delmar's Claghorn, using many of the same catchphrases, as ""It's a joke, son!"" or the infinitely variable constructions of (for example) ""Who's that -- I say, who's that a-knockin' at my door?""; ""So long -- so long, that is!"" and bizarre folksy comparisons such as ""I'm busier than a one-eyed man watchin' a burlesque show!""

This movie is a little known gem. It recounts the rise of Claghorn in an unexpected way, and provides a bit of backstory to the radio character. Certainly not for everyone, and not a great movie by any means, but an amusing and entertaining hour or so",1369180800,6,1325,4.915178571428571
7821599,2,6302112052,"I always liked the Sen. Claghorn character on the Fred Allen shows, and wondered what this film
would be like. Nice to see it, but it's a weak story with very mild humor. That's the way a
lot of movies were, then, of course. I had hoped the humor would be sharper. It was on the
Fred Allen radio show, because Fred Allen wrote the jokes for his show.",1270771200,,350,4.086956521739131
