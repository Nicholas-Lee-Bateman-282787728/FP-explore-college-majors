8717627,3,B00Y7R9HLA,"Courage is a tidy little amnesia noir, a typical RKO product of the era, only marginally film noir, mostly for its occasional shadowy scenes. It's a kind of synthesis of the Val Lewton RKO chillers and the Nick & Nora Charles mysteries, but not as good as good as either, though in its way a fun movie that delivers the B film goods from this most B of studios. As always Mann gives us sure, crisp direction, but Conway has the true star power to more or less carry the movie. And hes got an able supporting cast of familiar faces, in particular Roland Drew, Lester Matthews, Jane Greer and Jean Brooks.

The primary liability in the casting is Ann Rutherford as the perky, eminently too well coiffed, taxi driver. Her high-energy persona makes for a bumpy contrast with Conways near somnambulist take on his role. Indeed I would have preferred more of Jane Greer and Jean Brooks and much less of Miss Rutherford.

The pluses, however, more or less cancel out the flaws make this one a fun watch, one time through anyway, though I cant see going out of my way to catch it again. From me, then, a solid three but not quite four stars.",1469836800,,1133,4.4423076923076925

8717629,5,B00Y7R9HLA,"This is a remake of ""Two in the Dark"" with a little more humor . Both are good movies. As has been posted by others, it has snappy dialogue and a pretty good pace . I wonder, however, how many caught the double entree when The Rutherford character quipped about her coat... ""It's a wonder what a little rabbit does for a girl"".... while the busybody landlady was listening in. All in all, a worthwhile movie to get, even though the Richard Lane character is a little overboard.",1441584000,2,477,4.431818181818182
8717630,4,B00Y7R9HLA,"Two O'Clock Courage is a 1945 RKO joint that thrives on Anthony Mann's crisp direction (his inaugural film at RKO) and on the easy chemistry between Tom Conway and Ann Rutherford. It's not a film noir - it's not nearly cynical enough - as much as it is a whodunit with comic elements. Towards the foggy corner of Ocean View and Arch St. a man (Conway) walks with a shaky gait, caressing a half-split noggin. He's an amnesiac and we (and he) don't learn his real name until deep into the narrative. Good thing for him, a cabbie runs into him, almost. Patty Mitchell (Ann Rutherford) only has five more payments to make and then her trusty taxi - she calls it Harry - is all hers. But that's neither here nor there. Patty is one of them girls a man is lucky to have by his side. She's game and thinks fast on her feet and is fiercely loyal. It doesn't much faze her when, come to find, her latest fare just may have bumped off a famous theatrical producer. Off they hustle, trying to clear his good name, whatever it is.

Running at a brisk 66 minutes, it's an entertaining watch. I enjoyed it more than the 1936 movie it essentially remade, Two in the Dark (which is also pretty jake). Conway and Rutherford are wonderful together. He's a tall drink of water and a class act, and never mind the screen name he rolls with, Conway is a Sanders thru and thru. Just listen to his elegant diction, son, and you'll catch on quick that his dazed character can't possibly be the chauffer type (one of several identities the amnesiac thinks he may possible be). Meanwhile, Rutherford is sassy and very cute in her cabbie hat and proves resourceful enough to get Conway out of several tight scrapes. The movie really moves as our amateur sleuths dart from one clue to the next, bedeviled by red herrings and hounded by a nosy reporter and a dogged cop (this was set in an era in which the law readily asked reporters for assistance). The screenplay really plays up the amnesia angle, so there's tension that builds up in scenes where our leads are in the presence of the suspicious cop and reporter and they meet people/suspects they think may know Conway's true identity. Big ups, by the way, to Jane Greer (credited as Bettejane Greer) who cuts a memorable swathe as a sultry socialite, and you can see the potential in her to be a scorching femme fatale. And props also to Jean Brooks who is barely in the movie (she plays the stage actress), but, oh, her last scene... As I am a massive fan of the lighthearted Thin Man type of mystery, I soaked in the breezy, banterful tone of this movie. And maybe I'm a straight-up sucker, but I couldn't help but laugh at the nosy reporter who kept calling his editor about the latest breaking news about the case, only to have each of his scoops be proven false. Man, this movie just was not kind to the Fourth Estate.",1437868800,9,2850,4.418250950570342
8717631,5,B00Y7R9HLA,"Tom Conway does a good job in this mystery. His has sort of a Cary Grant type role,caught up in a sticky situation (he is not a detective) and he displays some Grant-style charm while trying to extricate himself from the predicament. Ann Rutherford is a perky single working girl in that sort of early 1940's manner similar to Marjorie Weaver or Marjorie Reynolds that keeps a film going with liveliness and exuberance. Enjoyable little mystery film.",1437696000,6,450,4.857142857142857
