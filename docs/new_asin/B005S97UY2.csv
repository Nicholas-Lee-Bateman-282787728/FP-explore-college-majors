4863368,5,B005S97UY2,"As an avid television viewer, I have seen series such as Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, The Wire, Deadwood, Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, Oz, Mad Men, among many others.  I consider myself to be pretty picky in what I watch, and I didn't even know the existence of this show until Kelsey Grammer beat out Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) for a Golden Globe for this show.  I was a little upset because Breaking Bad is one of my favorite shows and Bryan Cranston is one heck of an actor, but I realized that I couldn't complain until I actually watched Kelsey Grammer's performance.  And.....wow.  Just wow.

My favorite shows aren't black and white.  I hate fairytale shows with mushy romance, happy endings, and where the writers basically dictate who is good and bad to you.  I prefer my shows with characters with a bit more grey to them.  I want to make my own decisions on how I feel about characters without the writers pushing their morals in my face.  Not many shows are capable of this, because it's one of the most difficult things in television writing - stepping aside and letting your characters come to life on their own and letting viewers contemplate and think for themselves.  Boss does all of this.  It reminds me a lot of The Sopranos with its unforgiving, brutal tone that can really shake you to your core.  It makes you THINK.

The premise of the show is simple enough.  I decided to watch it On Demand without having any idea what it was about, except that it starred Kelsey Grammer.  He plays Tom Kane, the mayor of Chicago, and he undoubtedly dabbles in some ""questionable"" political practices.  The real thing here though is that Kane is diagnosed in the very first scene with Lewy Body Disease (similar to Alzheimer's), and so his mental health begins to deteriorate over time.  If you look up the symptoms of the disease, you see Kane start to really exemplify some of these symptoms, and it makes for some ominous and interesting television.

One of the things about this show that makes it unique is that while the characters are grey, Tom Kane is definitely more on the ""black side.""  He isn't your typical protagonist, but more like an ""antihero.""  Tony Soprano is honestly less of an antihero than this guy.  Tom Kane cares about one thing - Tom Kane.  Family, friends, honor, loyalty, constituents, none of that matters to him, and he'll do anything it takes to stay in power, and I mean *anything.*  Kelsey Grammer is perfect for this part.  He looks like a politician, acts like one, and has such a scary presence that I can't believe I used to watch him on Frasier.  This guy will scare the heck out of you.  His acting is phenomenal and I really had no idea what an amazing actor he was.  I can't think of any other actor in the world that could play the role of Tom Kane except him.

This show is disturbing.  It's brutal.  It's sick.  Twisted.  Morbid.  And it's all happening within the political system to boot.  Kelsey Grammer isn't the only good actor here.  Connie Nielsen plays Meredith Kane, Tom Kane's estranged wife.  Meredith is also highly politically-motivated and puts her self-image and politics above all else as well, and Nielsen plays it perfect.  Martin Donovan plays Ezra Stone, Tom Kane's senior political advisor and my favorite character after Kane.  He is intelligent, ambitious, and knows the game like Kane and is his most trusted advisor, and once again, he was perfectly cast.  Oh, and did I say *extremely* intelligent?  I am sick of watching political shows with dumb political advisors.  Ezra Stone is a genius and as the senior political advisor to Chicago's mayor, he damn well should be.  Kathleen Robertson (Beverly Hills 90210!) plays Kitty O'Neill, a personal aide to Kane.  She is a very interesting and confused character and incredibly unpredictable.  Hannah Ware plays Emma Kane, the estranged daughter, and she is also a complex character that I keep wanting to learn more about.  And finally, there is Jeff Hephner as Ben Zajac, the Illinois State Treasurer and candidate for the Governor of Illinois.  I can't say much of him as not to spoil anything for you, but he develops interesting relationships with several of the characters.

So, did Kelsey Grammer deserve this award?  I think him and Bryan Cranston's performances were pretty neck-and-neck, with them both portraying a wide variety of emotions and were absolutely out of this world amazing.  We're talking almost James Gandolfini quality here.  So I am obviously not upset anymore over Kelsey Grammer's Golden Globe win.  This show is DEFINITELY worth your time, and is definitely way underrated.  I hope this review can inspire more people to watch so that the seasons can keep coming.  Unfortunately, it's always easer to make a killer first season drama than it is to keep that momentum for seasons to come.  But I have high faith in the abilities of the writers to keep this going strong.  Oh, and it's been signed to another season already for August 17, 2012 (and we'll get 10 episodes instead of 8).

Break down:

POSSIBLE PROS
+Incredible acting, especially from Kelsey Grammer and Martin Donovan
+Unforgivingly brutal, thought-provoking, and suspenseful
+Characters are grey and open for interpretation; it's not black and white
+The dialogue and writing is unbelievably good, and even lines that may sound cheesy from others come out sounding great from this set of actors.
+It's pretty intense and sometimes scary, if you're into that.

POSSIBLE CONS
+If you're into more black and white shows with happier endings and storylines, you will find this to be a major downer.
+Only eight episodes :(
+There is a LOT of sex.  It's not extremely graphic, but it is heavily prevalent.  It doesn't bother me that much (although a little annoying), but sometimes it is rather gratuitous and I could see it bothering some viewers
+The political system is portrayed as incredibly shady and corrupt.  If you're not a believer of this level of politically brutality and corruption (and many find it too stereotypical of Chicago politics), you may not like it.

Overall, this fits right into the league of some of the best shows I have ever seen, assuming that it keeps going the way it is.  I completely recommend this to the serious, smart, contemplative television viewer.",1338940800,9,6315,4.80594243268338

The first episode of this series is interesting.

I'm anxious for the Premire on dvd to come out soon so I can share it with those who haven't Starz nor who willingly pay $10 a pop to watch it On Demand.

4863371,5,B005S97UY2,"We are now into the fourth episode of this ongoiing new series for television BOSS and while the entire series for the DVD cannot be reviewed as yet, t seems only fitting that the public be alerted to a show that is far above the usual series dramas made for television. It boasts some brilliant writing by Farhad Safinia, who was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1975 and left Iran with his family at the age of four to live in Paris, then London. At King's College, Cambridge, where he studied Economics, he directed and acted in a number of stage productions for the Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club and other theatre companies. After graduating, he moved to New York City where he studied film at the New School University and at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.  His only other screenplay to date is 'Apocalypto' but he clearly is someone to watch.  The production company includes Gus Van Sant and star Kelsey Grammer and Mario Van Peebles, and the work of some extraordinary cinematography

BOSS opens with Chicago Mayor Tom Kane  Kelsey Grammer) seated in an empty warehouse listening to his physician tell him is complete secrecy that he has Lewy-body dementia, a progressive degenerative neurologic disorder in which thread- like proteinaceous inclusions are deposited within neurites (Lewy neurites): the disease is not treatable, not curable, and as the patient decline the motor and sensory functions gradually are obliterated until the completely incapacitated victim dies.
From this opening Kane moves into action - a man who has clawed his way to the top of the political heap where he is now surrounded by a staff (Kathleen Robertson, Martin Donovan et al) who assist him in manipulating the election of the next governor of Illinois (Jeff Hephner is his choice).  There are numerable sidebars that weave in and out through the series - Kane's estranged wife (Connie Nielsen) has her own political agenda, Kane's equally estranged daughter (Hannah Ware) has turned away form her father's modus operandi only to bifurcate her life between evangelism and Free Clinic support as well as drug dealing with a growing romantic interest (Rotimi Akinosho), Kane's dealings with big business which happens to uncover historic Indian gravesites that cause another series of complications, his distrust of the Latino community and the payback for deeds he does not approve of, and while all of this is going an (and more) Kane must face his progressive deterioration of his physical life and try to regenerate a semblance of a spiritual/humanitarian life.  Of particular importance is the ever present reporter Sam Miller form the Chicago Sentinel (Troy Garity) who will likely assume more and more importance as the series roles on.

This is an astonishingly fine cast, a intensely creative script, and a show with exceptional production values.  Where will it go?  It is difficult to wait for the next installment in the weeks to come.  Grady Harp, November 11",1320451200,80,2985,5.0242914979757085
4863372,5,B005S97UY2,"This is a really odd show. It stars Kelsey Grammer as basically Rahm Emanuel running chicago as mayor. Its good and bad. Kelsey Grammer is outstanding in the lead in an acting sense. Its probably the most ambitious and best dramatic thing he has ever done. He plays completely against type in that he doesn't look like a chicago mayor. But he has a legtimate ruthlessness in acting the part that is worthy of ""all the kings men"". And he has an almost Shakespearean quality in doing the character. The mayor is a man who becomes whatever the situation requires. He is a man who is almost lost in himself. His wife is even better in that I can't ever remember the political wife being played in this way. She is a serious person playing her own game rather than a victim or a conscience. I like most of the characters. I like the attention to detail and I like the acting. Its an antidote to the simple-mindedness of ""the west wing"" that was so influential for so many years.

The only thing I didn't like was the basic premise of a man in decline (medically) and that at times they departed reality and went over the top. Drugging a woman in public in a car is silly. The whole thing with the ears was silly. They need these things for ratings but its a shame that something this good has to be brought down by that kind of nonsense.

I think it would have been better to have a man breaking down mentally and gradually collapsing rather than having a man be physically ill. But they could still do good things with what they have.

Its the most interesting thing on television so far this year in my opinion. Its flawed but its ambitious and a rather brave thing for television these days.

--------------------------

Some additional comments at the end of the first season.

The show maintained its quality right to the end. Its almost at the level of an American version of the British drama ""House of Cards"". The problem with it is that everything is blown up bigger than real life and exaggerated. Its like the violence and emotion knob is turned up to ""11"". If the killings became firings (or career destruction) and acts of violent intimidation became more normal threats, it would be a much better show. And be more real. An example of something I liked was the whole bit about dealing with a crisis and dealing with TV coverage (the whiteboard). I also liked the mechanics of showing how to influence a lawsuit or a newspaper. And I especially liked the meeting with the ward bosses near the end. I liked that the candidate for governor seemed to get progressively more out of control personally the more politically popular he got. One of the best moments was when he met the retired police officer and talked about why he was who he was....and the mirror of that moment at the end where his longtime assistant explains that he has ceased to benefit the city.

Where they were close to the reality of how things are done politically, they did great work. When they ignored reality in favor of overheated violence or other nonsense.

The only thing that never quite worked was the daughter. Her backstory was far too complicated and contrived. And it seems that there is nowhere left to go with that character.

In the next season they have potential to explore/contrast republican politics in the state with democratic (Chicago) politics in the context of a statewide election for governor. If they are as honest about those issues as they were about the politics of the city, it could be quite good.",1319587200,11,3510,4.5587301587301585

4863594,4,B005S97UY2,"Gritty dramas are going to be just that, gritty. Especially if they're a series specially made for HBO or Showtime. It's Kelsey Grammar and the lead heroine from Gladiator; so phenomenal, gripping acting was expected and it was delivered.

A cast made up of devious, narcissistic, megalomaniacal, egotistical, power-hungry, amoral, immoral characters takes viewers on an emotional roller coaster ride of sex, greed and never ending drama. No one, and I mean no one, is above being used, abused, drugged, kidnapped or murdered.  There was even some incest (season 2) thrown in for good measure. Grammer's character is capable of empathy so he isn't a true psychopath, but he's able to put any and all feelings of empathy aside to destroy the people he cares about if it'll keep him in power.

And that's where a lot of the unrealism comes in. The way he drugs and incapacitates people at will, the way he murders anyone of his choosing, after a while becomes too unrealistic. Sometimes the amount of power he has and exerts stretches into the realm of fiction/fantasy. At some point shocking but credible becomes incredulous. If the dragons from GoT were to swoop in to kill one of his rivals, it wouldn't seem that out of place. That's how many times the viewers have to suspend disbelief...that dragons would be just one more time. Okay, maybe that's an exaggeration, but only slightly so.

Bottom line, as far-fetched as some of the plot lines are (and they are) this show will keep you coming back for more, if just to see what will happen next. Despite conflicting with common sense many-a-times, it's definitely entertaining and provoking. And just as in GoT, you never know which of your favorite characters will get whacked next.",1421539200,,1736,4.874576271186441

'House of Cards' looks cowardly compared to the true grit and deceit of the 'special interest' groups both the seen and unseen (hidden hand).  I loved the actress who played the Boss' wife, Connie Nielsen--She was great! Unlike the wooden one-dimensional squinty eyed Robin Wright in 'HoC'....the only thing saving 'HoC' is Kevin Spacey! 'Boss' is totally worth watching and so much more, it's fun to be entertained, but it's also sad that we as Americans are forced to fund this corruption-----a must see!  I hope Kelsey G and F. Safinia make a mini series or movie to give this series an ending! Pissed that it lasted only 2 seasons (but what American is surprised?).

I can't take this seriously."" I was soooooo wrong! I guess growing up I only saw Kelsey Grammer in the context of comedic shows like 'Cheers' and 'Frasier' or as the voice of Side Show Bob in 'The Simpsons.'

If my friend hadn't given me Season One as a gift I probably would have overlooked the show for a long time especially since it was not picked up after the second season and I figured that it was due to it being kind of flat. Why it wasn't picked up has to be political, no pun intended.

Kelsey Grammer gives an absolutely outstanding and chilling performance. It was a role that he was born to play. It's almost like Al Pacino and the role of Michael Corleone, you can't imagine anyone else in the role and know that the characters they're portraying will eat you alive with no hesitations. The episodes are so well written and the viewer really gets a taste of what Chicagoland politics are like. In the end, viewers get a sense of why a guy like Rahm Emanuel preferred to become mayor of this city over being the right hand man of the leader of the free world.

4863863,4,B005S97UY2,"If evil, ruthless, methodical politicians is your thing then this is pretty much as good, and occasionally better, than the original House of Cards. That should be enough to make it a surefire purchase, but i'll try to elaborate.
The basic set-up of ruthless power politics is handled well and informatively. Most characters are interesting, and Kelsey Grammer is really nice as the outwardly charming, yet utterly scary, mayor. The storyline is a nice selection of double crosses over double crosses, and most of these are plausible enough. It shows the webs of power and money, and the matter-of-factlyness of arrangements between all the structures of a city.

I was on the edge of my seat for most of the episodes, and the characters will remain with me for quite some time. Though it must be said that i felt the ending failed to work properly. There is neither definite closure, nor the proper set-up for a second season. Tom Kane coming out on top of this season relies too heavily on stupid actions/inactions on the part of actors who up until becoming slobbering imbeciles are ruthless, faultless, schemers. That they suddenly decide to flip out at the pivotal moment just does not seem likely. This is a shame, as the rest of the series is so darn good.

It is also weird that mayor Kane's medical condition features so heavily in the first three or four episodes, then for all intents and purposes never to be seen again.

Watch it and enjoy it, but keep yourself braced for a slightly disappointing ending.

4863869,1,B005S97UY2,"I am proposing that this Blu-ray disc be boycotted. The Blu-ray format relies heavily on scripting, so much so that the producer of a disc has almost unlimited control over the way that the player behaves, when the disc is played. Unfortunately, some Blu-ray producers with compromised ethics exploit this in a way that consumers should find intolerable, and should simply refuse to accept. Consumers had no voice in defining the Blu-ray specification, and if they had, it almost certainly would have been done in a way that would insure that when you put a disc in the player, you are able to access the movie and the menus without having to first play your way through a bunch of previews. If they want to put promotional material of this sort on the disc, the right way to do that is to make them a special feature, accessible through the disc's main menu the same as all the other special features on the disc. Many Blu-ray discs do this. The way put previews on a disc is NOT by doing it in a way such that they have to be played through before you can even access the main menu for the disc. And even if the control buttons for fast-forwarding and stepping through the previews are enable, this still does not make it acceptable to put the previews in the disc in this manner. A couple of times while watching this movie, I accidentally hit the stop button on my remote. I was not even able to resume play, and this as well is a fault of the way the disc was produced. I should have been able to resume, but was not able to do even that. Instead, I had to start over, much as though I had just inserted the disc. I had to sequence back through the previews all over again, and then bunch of other short video segments, such as the one that it promotional for DTS sound, all of which are accompanied by individual scripts that the player has to locate in order to load. It took several minutes in total to get back to where I was, and this is with a newer, fast player with a good reputation for being a fast player. I shudder to think what this would have been like on my older Pioneer Blu-ray player (which was a piece of junk). Each and every time you decided to watch this disc, you have to go through this all over again. It should not be this way. This disc was produced by people who had no sense of ethics. It should be boycotted.",1375833600,2,2343,4.2792792792792795

4863871,5,B005S97UY2,"While this isn't without flaws, especially in the first few episodes, it develops into an intense, tremendously
well acted and deeply chilling portrait of power and it's various abuses.

Kelsey Grammer is a frightening Godfather-like mayor of Chicago, who reveals just enough humanity for
us to hope for some redemption.  Or are even those flashes just an act?  Almost everyone in this show is
working an angle, playing their cards, hoping to come out on top and not worried about who they step
on to get there.  Filled with some really surprising and often depressing turns, this is as dark a look at
U.S. politics as I've seen in a long time.  And to me that makes this important viewing.  Because sadly, as
over the top as the show can seem, why do I think it's much, much closer to reality than we'd all like to
believe?

As for the weak spots, there are a couple of performances in supporting roles that don't quite keep up,
and especially in the first few episode a lot of gratuitous sex that feels shoehorned in. Believe me, I love
a good sex scene.  Just not when it feels like there's no reason for it to be there besides someone in
power saying `hey, no one's been naked for 15 minutes!'  But that starts to fade as the season goes
along, as do the plot holes.  At the same time the emotional power grows, and by the last couple of

I was very fond of Ezra's character, and I was kind of disappointed at the end of season one; however, that makes more drama for the show.

4863973,5,B005S97UY2,"If you've watched all eleven seasons of ""Frasier,"" you probably were doubled over in hysterical laughing fits at various points of that show. ""Frasier"" is nearly universally viewed as one of the most successful comedy shows ever made, and Kelsey Grammer ""walks away"" with his comedic performance (as do the other excellent cast in that show). But after viewing that show, if you've then heard that Grammer has taken on the dramatic role as the mayor of Chicago in a serious drama, you're bound to be skeptical he can pull it off. After all, isn't he a comedian? The truth is that many great comedians simply cannot pull off a dramatic role, not for lack of talent, but because the skill sets between these two performance crafts are so different.

But, as surprising as it may be, ""Boss"" is perhaps Grammer's greatest performance yet, even when compared with ""Frasier."" If you've scanned through any of the reviews of ""Boss"" here on Amazon, you've likely seen one person after another say that this is one of the best dramatic shows they've ever seen, and all I can say is that this is Grammer like you've never seen him before. He's so good that it's SCARY. (""Do you know who I am? (growling) ... I'm the Mayor of Chicago!"")

""Boss"" is a serious drama about a fictional mayor of Chicago, but anyone who knows anything about the Windy City knows that this show is closely mirrored against those famous Chicago mayors, ""bosses"" of a city empire that stretches back to 1837. If you know the history of the city, ""Boss"" is like walking into the inner circle of one of those mayors, giving detail and insight into the broad story lines that have been associated with Chicago throughout the 20th century. It's nakedly tough: there's nothing polite, sugar-coated, or weak about it. It's so direct and powerful that it may catch you off guard at first. In fact, it is the opening scene of the first episode that completely shakes off any fleeting concern that this may be ""Frasier in the City."" It knocks you off your feet with a painful and open description of the life of the mayor, and then goes on throughout  the entire fist season (eight one-hour episodes) to see the story arc unfold. Grammer has said in interviews that the story is not about politics, but rather about the life story of this mayor as he clings to power. He may be right, but the story takes place within the political environment, and we can't help but feel that politics is indeed a part of this story.

Grammer won a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Mayor Thomas Kane (strangely enough, only two letter's away from ""Crane""), and nearly anyone who has watched the show understands why. Grammer is powerful, honest, intimidating, believable. His presence is almost like one of the gargoyles at the top of the Notre Dame in Paris, a seemingly all-knowing presence watching over the city with a medieval grimace. Although I said it before, I'll say it again: this is a scary-good performance.

The supporting cast is also uniformly excellent. Casting was superbly accomplished in ""Boss,"" and each character is as believable as Mayor Kane himself. The characters are also each interesting in their own rights, with snarky, shadowy, and politically ambitious people all working with and around each other. It's really an impressive ensemble.

And, on a minor note, some of the brief shots you'll see of Chicago at various points throughout the series are just gorgeous. If you are watching on Blu-Ray, the city shines and sparkles in a way that reminds us that Chicago is one of the most architecturally significant cities in the world. If you can, watch this on Blu-Ray. You'll see vistas of Chicago, both day and night, that just glitter.

And yet Chicago is only a backdrop to the story of ""Boss."" ""Boss"" is about Mayor Kane's political career, his power over aldermen, his continual vying and maneuvering to keep the reins of power.

There are some difficult pieces to follow in some of the episodes that may make you want to re-watch them to assemble the pieces together. But you'll almost certainly want to re-watch the series anyway, so this is not an issue. There is a lot of complexity in both the characters as well as the interwoven plot that I only made full sense of after two full viewings of both seasons.

There was some talk that Grammer was incredibly upset when the series was cancelled by Starz at the end of Season Two. When you see the show, you'll understand why, and will probably share that feeling. The decision to cancel the show in Season Two must stand as one of the most incredibly stupid decisions by a television channel in recent memory. Yes, the ratings were not what they could have been in Season Two, but other things could have been done, including a ""wrap-up"" episode that doesn't leave us hanging after the events of Season Two. But don't let any of that muttering deter you. Season One stands on its own as an amazing work, and, to be honest, Season Two does, as well (but you have to accept that, if you watch Season Two, you'll be left with numerous unanswered questions and uncompleted plot lines).

I used to say to my wife while we were watching ""Frasier"" that it almost seemed that Kelsey Grammer wasn't acting at all when he did that show, and that ""Frasier"" was just a fortuitous casting that allowed Grammer to be himself. I have to completely revise that view. ""Boss"" also shows Grammer as one who seems not be acting at all, so believable is his performance. I think it is difficult to now deny that Grammer is anything less than an incredibly gifted actor, and one who works hard at his roles to make them what they should be.

""Boss"" is certainly going to stand for quite some time as a premier show in the genre. Five stars.

As with a number of television shows of recent times, ""Boss"" doesn't make any sense unless each episode is watched, and in order. If you attempt to enter midstream into the series, it doesn't work. The story lines are interwoven and build upon each other, so you have to watch these in order, starting right with episode one. (And, oh, yes, ""Boss"" is also one of those rare shows where the ""pilot"" episode is absolutely fantastic, right up in quality with all the subsequent episodes.) There are eight one-hour episodes in Season One, and ten one-hour episodes in Season Two.  Watch them in order!",1366675200,,6350,4.6589285714285715
4863974,2,B005S97UY2,"Hard to see KG doing non-comedy. Would be nice if it had some subtle humor, but that is something I like to see in political dramas. I found the political backstabbing and intrigue to be too simplistic and lacking nuance. Are deals cut? Do various groups press for their political agenda? Sure, but in a far more subtle way - even in Chicago. The series kind of boxed itself in by giving KG a mental illness in the first episode - and a serious one at that. Even if the show were successful, you've practically killed the main character before you could get anyone to have empathy for them. The rest of the characters are that way as well - people who you wouldn't want to know anyway. All TV is becoming like this in a bid to make characters complex and real - the problem that the writers don't understand is that the viewer, in general, wants to get away from that.",1366588800,,868,4.331288343558282

4863976,3,B005S97UY2,"Granted, this is an award-winning series, but it's obviously more of a ""male guilty pleasure"" than a ""real life"" drama.  To prove the point, Kathleen Robertson as Kitty O'Neill, who's Tom Kane's personal aide, is hep, knowledgeable and the Boss respects her ability.  They could have had the young lady lured away to a better job by a high-powered attorney or something.  Instead, to satisfy male-ego, in order to retire her from the series, this very intelligent sex-kitten isn't using ""birth control""!  Yeah, they write a ""modern gal"" into the script and then use a Victorian Age excuse: ""she's pregnant"" to write her out!  The writers really had to get creative to reach for that conclusion!  It worked for them, but it turned me off.",1366156800,2,737,4.856

4864072,5,B005S97UY2,"There is a problem when portraying crime and evil: some in the industry apparently feel the need for whatever reason to steer such portrayals with Pollyannic finesse or on the other end with a hyped super-evil-drive. When the story and set is polished, neither extreme of presentation holds much akin to the real thing (crime and ordinary everyday politics-as-evil), and it all then becomes something to be considered as not all that bad is it, or wow that is so over-the-top that no one could believe that such evil actually exist.

To us, this was real, gritty, nasty stuff just like from Congress and from other politician lawyers who many glorify for their evil; actually, they do get glorified for it all. Think that I'm exaggerating: then talk with any ex-Congressperson who left Congress because they could not take the corruption of their fellow lawyers any longer.

And as I have written prior, ""Who pray tell is Kelsey Grammer Golden Boy when all I saw was 'da Mister Mayor Devil Man himself. Him 'da Bears. Him 'da Boss. Him is 'da beast's 'only' best. Now that was acting, thought I had died and gone to dep mode if you catch my drift cool daddy. Yeehaw!"".

In this show Thomas Kane (Kelsey) is the mayor of Chicago who comes under fire for some improper waste management and has to deal with some political intrigue and backstabbing that seems all too common in political dramas.

The show also shines a funny light on unfaithful politicians (who would have thought haha) and the apparent ho-hum reactions of their wives.

Kelsey does a decent job and is the strongest actor in this show for sure.  The reporter initially comes off as a d-bag, but becomes sort of likeable throughout the season.

I would recommend this season to fans of Kelsey Grammer or who just want to indulge in political intrigue.  Decent show, but nothing amazing.",1354233600,,908,4.745222929936306

Centered around the political machinations of the Mayor of Chicago, the show chronicles the back-alley dealings, sexual exploits, and double crossings of the up-and-comers and established political leaders. Grammer, portraying the Mayor, gives a tour-de-force performance, wavering between bouts of self-pity, denial, terrible displays of power, regret, raw ambition, self-preservation, and betrayal. He walks the tragic hero line carefully; he's part hero, part monster.

Second, the television show Boss is a terrible delight.  It's a dark study of a powerful man doomed to death.  It's intriguing and I'm hooked.  Also, on a side note, the camera work on the show is great.  Lot's of really shallow depth of field that I find totally engrossing.  Just gorgeous.

He's the best kind of ""villain"" because he evokes sympathy for his various difficulties and then turns around and does something so reprehensible that you can't believe you ever felt sorry for him.  Then you get sucked in again....  In short, his performance is riveting.

Boss does provide a nasty little look into the world of politics and power.  I recommend it----and stay beyond the first couple episodes because it takes some time for things to tie together and to get to know the characters.  The pay off is worth it.",1350086400,,709,4.616

My criticism isn't with the actors. It's with the writers. How many times do those of us who search for substance get handed tits, ass, and the same old old old sub-stories rather than what we're really searching for. Did I mention that was substance?

If the writers could devote a higher percentage of the story to good-substantive-plot and less to adolescent-tittilating-filler, then this program wouldn't mask the performance of the actors that matter.

-ps. Check out ""Breaking Bad"" for an example of what I'm talking about.",1349568000,3,711,5.068376068376068

However, once I watched the first episode of this dark political drama, I was sucked in. Kelsey Grammer gives a demanding performance as Tom Kane, mayor of Chicago, who is battling a life-threatening brain disease. I do wish it had a few tangents from time to time though, as the story was very much serious and agenda-driven. I will definitely be curious how this series continues to play out, and if they can keep it up, it's sure to make it's place as a classic dark drama up there with The Sopranos.

4864489,5,B005S97UY2,"This was purchased at the urging of my wife who had read that this was a bold, and gritty look at Illinois politics; and politics in general.  It was far more than that.  I never knew that Kelsey Grammer could act this well.  This is so different from any other role I have seen him in (which were mostly comedies like Cheers, Frazier or La Cage aux Folles).  Grammer was powerful, dynamic and his facial expressions were always perfect for the scene.  He became Kane.  The scene in the final episode where he leaves the gubernatorial candidate while still on his knees is worth the price of the series by itself.

My criticisms of this (and several other well received TV shows of late) are primarily two-fold.  First is that I came to dislike all of the characters. These are not people I would like to have drinks or dinner with... or even know.  The series begins with Kane being told that he has a progressive illness; a bit of information I thought was revealed to garner sympathy for him.  Yet, through the series he not only tries to keep that from every one, but battles against it as if in defiance; that the great Kane is too powerful to be fallen by something so petty as a disease.  Still, when Kane sacrificed his daughter to save his career, and essential prostituted his wife for political support, I lost all respect or empathy for either character.  The fact that his wife would comply with his suggestion speaks volumes.

The other criticism is that a ""gritty, adult"" drama has to have an obligatory steamy sex scene or an f-bomb every 10 minutes. To me those are easy ways out of a scene.  I am certainly no prude, and while I did not mind seeing Kitty O'Neil (Kathleen Robertson) naked, it only furthered the plot slightly to show gubernatorial candidate Ben Zajac (Jeff Hephner) to be just another sleazy politician; that could have been done any number of ways.  And the response of his wife, Maggie (Nicole Forester), to his infidelities made just one more character I didn't like. They were all corrupt; I am not even mentioning the corrupt aldermen.

Over all, I do recommend the first season of Boss.  It was well done and definitely worth viewing but I am not certain how much more of these despicable people I can stand in a second season.  Or maybe that is why I watch... it is like seeing an accident about to happen and I can't take my eyes off of the pending disaster.  But, I sure hope this is not an accurate view of Chicago politics.",1347062400,,2469,4.495515695067264

I guess, working on the show, as a press photographer,  has given me more of an understanding  of the in's and out's of the many plots.  The awards the show has received, shows how great BOSS is.

4864656,5,B005S97UY2,"After hearing so many people rave about ""Boss"" during it's first season, I had to check it out for myself. Luckily we were being offered a free limited subscription to Starz so I was able to catch up with the episodes in what I would say would be an obsessive manner.  I knew that my husband would also enjoy this series, but alas our trial subscription ended. That led me to purchase Season One from Amazon.

Needless to say I watched all the episodes again with my husband (in marathon fashion) and he too was hooked.  We are currently enjoying Season 2 together as I signed up for Starz so I wouldn't miss it.

This is a role of a lifetime for Kelsey Grammer who plays Tom Kane, the fictional role of mayor of Chicago.  This is not the lovable Frasier Crane we have come to love and laugh at in ""Cheers or Frasier"". He is corrupt, vicious, calculating and vengeful.  The picture on the cover of this DVD says it all.  It'a an Emmy winning performance and he wasn't even nominated this year.

Alot has been said about Chicago and Illinois politics being corrupt, but it's nothing like the Chicago politics pictured in this series. As a life-long Chicagoan I have become used to the ""slings and arrows"" that come our way, but I think I can say with some certainty that non of our mayors have been as corrupt as Tom Kane. (At least I hope not)

I enjoy seeing our city featured on television and the fact that it's shot here and not somewhere else designed to depict Chicago, is great for our city.

Bottom line, if you love politics, suspense, intrigue and yes, SEX, you will love this show. If you don't want to spend more money on your cable provider to get Starz, you can order the seasons through Amazon like we did.",1345939200,5,1721,4.383647798742138
4864657,5,B005S97UY2,"After the success of BOSS Season 1 many people wondered if with all the terminal changes n the last episode of Season 1 could there possibly a Season 2.  The answer is an emphatic YES! Season 2  premiered this week with many of the same cast members in the same rolls, but with enough changes due to developments in the first season to change certain aspects. Kelsey Grammer continues his fine acting as Mayor Tom Kane, Connie Nielsen is his peculiar wife (with a surprise at the end of the first episode), Jonathan Groff (a very fine promising actor) replaces Kathleen Robertson who is staying with her parents during a shocking pregnancy,  Hannah Ware as Kane's daughter is in prison, Troy Garity is now editor of the Sentinel and is beginning to reveal that even honest people can be bought in this tale of Chicago corruption. Jeff Hephner, Sanaa Lathan and Rotimi continue their fine roles.

As for the storyline this season, Tom Kane cements his mayoral legacy with a lavish ceremony celebrating the groundbreaking of the new modernized O'Hare terminals. Now Kane looks to the future, setting his sights on reviving a subsidized housing project. While his political future seems bright, Kane continues to battle for control over his disease. And that is where this series is serving a public service.  Kan suffers form Lewy Body Dementia and it deserves definition as few viewers have ever heard of it: according to the Mayo Clinic definition, `In Lewy body dementia, abnormal round structures -- called Lewy bodies -- develop in regions of your brain involved in thinking and movement. LBD is not a rare disease. It affects an estimated 1.3 million individuals and their families in the United States. Because LBD symptoms can closely resemble other more commonly known diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, it is currently widely underdiagnosed. In the early 1900s, while researching Parkinson's disease, the scientist Friederich H. Lewy discovered abnormal protein deposits that disrupt the brain's normal functioning. These Lewy body proteins are found in an area of the brain stem where they deplete the neurotransmitter dopamine, causing Parkinsonian symptoms. In Lewy body dementia, these abnormal proteins are diffuse throughout other areas of the brain, including the cerebral cortex. The brain chemical acetylcholine is depleted, causing disruption of perception, thinking and behavior. Lewy body dementia exists either in pure form, or in conjunction with other brain changes, including those typically seen in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.'

So we have a new season of a fine show created by Farhad Safina,  written by Dee Johnson and Kevin J. Hynes and directed by Jim McKay that is unafraid to uncover dirty politics and concerned enough about audience medical information that it presents an important disease for us to study.

He followed it up with ""Back to You"" where he was a newscaster with Patricia Heaton and I loved that show for the one season it ran. Here, Kelsey does a straight forward drama where he plays the Mayor of Chicago, Tom Kane fighting a progressive illness and employing nasty techniques to stay in power. The show is well done and the supporting characters are excellently played. But I'd say the show is just ""okay"" and nothing more because Kelsey's characteer is so one dimensional he doesn't get any of the 'range' he is so good at doing comedy. Its not that he & the show aren't good or well made, they are. Its just that everybody is so focused on 'screwing' everybody else in more ways than one that its hard to have any 'rooting interest' for anybody. And I'm no prude but this show has a ton of nudity in it each episode that just doesn't enhance the stories in my opinion. The Women who disrobe on a regular basis are all gorgeous and brave to be sure, but the powerful men in the show keep their clothes on. I know this show just started its second season and I'll purchase it when it comes out just like I did season one, but I'll hope that Kelsey returns to a comedy where he can be in a role where he is his usual endearing, pompus, hilarious self.",1345161600,3,1378,4.243346007604563
4864661,1,B005S97UY2,"Kelsey Grammer is a fantastic actor but he is not the main actor in this new series. The camera is.

Unfortunately, this is another TV series with good actors and story that is spoiled by
a camera that doesn't stop shaking up and down, left and right...
Besides, some images are clearly out of focus thanks to the hysterical handling of the camera.
The camera is just too visible, too interfering.

Many people don't notice or don't care  about this sort of thing. Many have short span of attention and actually like this sort of thing. But if you do
notice and don't like to watch a show where the  camera is wobbly all the time, then you might not enjoy this series and it would be better not to order it.

Boss is a drama about a powerful politician in the 21 first century Chicago that has  some of ""King Lear"" about him.
The first season has only eight episodes, what makes sense because I really can't see how this series can go beyond 20 episodes or so.

The disc has subtitles in English and Spanish.

There is an interview with the executive producer and Kelsey Grammer in extra features. The executive producer grew up in London and studied in Cambridge, before moving to the US.
His British  background explains the choice for a horrible, mediocre handheld camerawork that is so typical of many BBC/British documentaries and TV series.

Some sequences, like the first sex scene or a scene where the mayor dreams with a horse are creative and very strong.
The problem is that the camera is wobbly all the time and sometimes they have that BBC syndrome of showing confuse images,
like  backs of  chairs, that don't really add anything to the story.

One good example of the idiocy of the camerawork is during a dramatic speech in  a church.
The background music is  Erik Satie. It is one of those sad, slow pieces of Satie.
They use the music, clearly, to create an atmosphere of intimacy and drama but it doesn't work because the slow, delicate music just doesn't match with
the loud, drunk  camera.

""Boss"" doesn't have the coherence of ""The Wire"", ""Sopranos"" (apart from the last half season), ""Mad Men"" and other TV series that respect the public's intelligence.  Two of the main characters of ""Boss""  do, in the end of the season, things that  contradict everything that they did before. They behave in an unexpected, absolutely implausible way because it was the only way to keep the series going on. It is a sign that the authors of this series, like the fictional mayor  of Chicago, will also do whatever it takes to add more seasons to the series...

The only important character  that shows a consistent  behaviour from the first to the last episode is the main one, the camera...",1345161600,12,2699,4.598326359832636
4864662,5,B005S97UY2,"i was a big fan of Frasier Crane, Grammer's twenty year role in situation comedy, first on CHEERS and then on FRASIER. He played a psychiatrist who was beset with personal problems on every level and was hilarious. For anyone who knows him as Frasier, it is a real shock to see him as the deeply corrupt Mayor of Chicago in BOSS. He is also terminally ill with a disease which is affecting his memory and causing him hallucinations.  His main concern is staying in power for the time he has left and he will do anything to achieve this. He is a very evil guy and about as anti-Frasier a character as he could find. he has a very able supporting cast but make no mistake, he is what anchors and holds together the whole show. He does a fantastic job.  Season two begins in less than a week and I am ready for it.  This is a very dark show but excellent. It is hard to see how he can become much more corrupt but I'm more than ready to watch it happen!

He sheds any tainted memory of Frasier in the first ten minutes of the series and puts on a clinic for the superiority of facial expression over dialogue as a method of communication.  And with this episode, I also applaud the writers.  I was on the fence about the writing as I was losing interest in the story over the past few episodes, but this episode blew me away.  Maybe I'm not the brightest star in the sky, but I was totally surprised, shocked, disgusted, but spellbound as the story unfolded in this episode.

But he has enough good qualities and Grammer is such a nuanced actor that we empathize with him, the same as we did for Vito Corleone in The Godfather. The plot is a Shakespearean tragedy like Macbeth or King Lear, the  dialogue, photography, cinematography and the supporting cast is wonderful, especially the actors who play the consigliere Ezra Stone, Cain's wife and daughter. There's a scene in the last episode where Cain is standing in front of a mural that I won't describe so as not to spoil it that shows his true character. There's also a hit man that is scary as hell.

On one of the disc extras, Kelsey Grammer and the director say this is a bit of King Lear for the modern era.

Don't want to give away anything to those that haven't seen it, but when the mayor seems to be down, out, and on the ropes, he made good on his statement that ""In the course of doing what I believe is best for this city, there is collateral damage, so be it!"".

""Boss: Season One""
-----------------------------------------------------
America's current hate-affair with our politicians is taken to the n-th degree in this well-written but often overwrought soap opera-ish political drama, in which nearly every character is untrustworthy and unlikable. Kelsey Grammer produces the series and stars as Thomas Kane, a fictitious, uber-Machiavellian mayor of modern-day Chicago, in control of a huge political machine that can make or break anyone in the state of Illinois.  The series draws on a wealth of talent, including directors Gus Van Sant and Mario Van Peebles; one thing I liked, however, was that other than Grammer most of the cast were unknown to me, and the acting was mostly pretty good.

I thought the dialogue was good as well, peppered with allusions, subtle barbs, and hidden meanings galore, well delivered by the cast. Where the writing failed, however, was in the dramatic turns and devices used to further the plot, which were frequently unbelievable and distracted from, rather than aided, the story. For a series that was supposed to show the main character's super-duper political skill, the screenwriters rely heavily on lots of clumsy, overt violence -- threatening people, beating them up, maiming them, killing them -- employed at times of crisis that would seem to call for subtlety and finesse. It's dramatic and visceral, good for TV I suppose, but it doesn't ring true as something that might happen in the real world: I don't think the mayor of Chicago, worried about unfavorable media attention, would be ordering his opponents to be so obviously bullied or injured.

Comparisons with ""The Wire"" are inevitable here, and ""The Wire"" soars past this series in terms of resonance and believability. The writers of ""Boss"" are over-reliant on clumsy, thuggish violence as a way to resolve dramatic tension (and titillate the audience) and rarely do we see Mayor Kane, or any other characters, using what I would consider real political finesse to achieve their goals. Lots of graphic sex scenes, too, for what that's worth.

Still, political junkies will probably enjoy this show - it echoes the cynicism of many in today's political landscape and may have the right tang for many viewers. I, however, am probably in the minority in that I don't actually believe that all politicians are by definition bad, dishonest, unprincipled hypocrites: I think most people who go into politics do so with good intentions, and while ""the system"" forces them into compromises, the picture painted here -- in which there isn't a single honorable person to be found anywhere in the Illinois landscape -- seems to me to be a bit much. Also, in this first season, which centers on the results of a gubernatorial primary, the *only* politicians we see are Democrats, and their universal sleaziness is perhaps a reflection of Kelsey Grammer's own far-right conservatism. (He endorsed Michelle Bachmann for President.) It'll be interesting to see how Republican politicians are portrayed in Season 2. Anyway, this series has some strong points and may have some legs beyond this first eight-episode run. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue video reviews)",1342569600,3,3244,5.317738791423002
