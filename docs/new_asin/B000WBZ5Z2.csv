2966503,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"One of the greatest Britcoms EVER.  These are gems, and absolutely some of the funniest tv ever made. I started buying these for my Scottish husband as gifts each birthday & Christmas to help stave off homesickness.  We KEEP buying them because they're so wonderful. There is truly something funny about them that appeals to every age range, from teenager to the elderly.",1410220800,,371,4.873015873015873

2966506,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"I ordered up these DVD's because it was a good, clean comedy that is set during WWII. Because it is British dry humor I needed to pay attention to everything said or I would miss the punch line. I found parts of each episode that would have me  laughing out loud. I purchased the first seven years. I had read that after that thee were changes made that didn't lend to the previous episodes. I anyone has a comment on that, I'd like to hear.",1391990400,,441,4.188235294117647
2966507,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"Outrageous, silly, absurb, farcial fun.  English humor,  You can't stop with just one.  I have them all.  Laughter is good medicine.",1385078400,,132,5.142857142857143
2966508,5,B000WBZ5Z2,Series Seven doesn't disappoint. It's a delightful collection of British comedy at its best. Each episode ends with nothing resolved except for one's appetite for great comedy.,1383350400,,176,5.555555555555555
2966509,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"And World War 2 continues. Rene is caught in the middle again, trying to keep the German's and the French resistance apart. It's not easy! but very funny!",1379721600,,154,4.535714285714286
2966520,5,B000WBZ5Z2,perfect! love the series! enjoyed it on pbs and I am glad to be collecting it. hope to get all episodes soon.,1376092800,,109,4.0
2966521,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"I am repeating the same thing I say about every episode.  No more clever British comedy series has ever been produced.
Unfortunately my series six through nine disks have become unwatchable even though I have only watched them straight through five times.  I live in PA and have sent all nine seasons of Allo 'Allo to a friend in CA who has equally enjoyed them.",1359763200,,362,4.553846153846154
2966522,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"Set in occupied France during WWII. There are multiple stories going on in this fast paced comedy. If you like ""Are you being Served"" you will love ""Allo Allo!""",1354233600,,160,4.551724137931035
2966523,5,B000WBZ5Z2,I just about split my side watching these episodes.  Some reviews have mentioned the series later than 5 were not as funny and that somehow the serious accident that Gordon Kaye (note the near vertical crease in his brow) experienced left him less able to entertain.  My family disagrees with that - some of these episodes are the best we have seen.  We have been buying each series in order to get the full effect and can barely wait to see Series 8.,1306281600,2,451,4.409638554216867
2966524,4,B000WBZ5Z2,"This series is wonderful - light entertainment, great for the end of the day when you don't want to have to think hard about anything, but want to have a laugh.",1278806400,,160,4.193548387096774
2966525,4,B000WBZ5Z2,Continuation of the story.  Renee goes to England but only for a short time.,1252540800,,76,4.428571428571429
2966526,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"Funny as usual, will probably order all of the series.  Wondering how it will end.",1246406400,,82,4.466666666666667
2966527,4,B000WBZ5Z2,"Sometimes a stew--or a ragout in this case--is so perfect that if you change any of the ingredients, it does not taste the same. The proposition holds true for original cast of ""Allo Allo"" which represented a perfectly delicious combination of comic actors. Unfortunately, by season seven, they had lost the original daffy Monsieur LeClerq who revealed his disguise with raised spectacles and the charmingly chicken-hearted Capitano Bertorelli. It is not that their replacements are not excellent, because they are; it is merely that the new combination of ingredients has altered the perfect flavor of the original comic concoction.

On the plus side, Sam Kelly (Hans, of the first several seasons who escaped, by mistake, to England) turns up in British Intelligence, where he has been groomed to be a proper Englishman by the Cambridge Spies, Burgess and Maclean!

There are still plenty of laughs, gimmicks, and running gags; and Series Seven is well worth adding to your collection.  But some of that original piquant zest is missing.",1240272000,2,1039,5.1726190476190474
2966528,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"The seventh season of 'Allo 'Allo lives up to the promise of the first six. The hilarious misadventures of cafe owner Rene Artois and the rest of the characters - Germans, British, French, Italian - in occupied
France during  WWII is not to be missed. There are the French Resistance (""Listen very carefully, I shall say this only once""), the Communist Resistance, a couple of silly British airman stranded in France and  several German officers. All the girls and one guy, a German Lieutenant, are in love with Rene. The Gestapo is also represented by Herr Flick and his sidekick, both of whom walk with a limp (shades of Joseph Goebbels).  Throw into the mix a host of other characters, weird disguises, improbable situation, and this is British comedy at its finest. You won't stop laughing. PBS showed this series many years ago, and I a so glad BBC has brought it out in DVD format. The last series (season 9) is due tobe released  in October 2008. I can hardly wait!!",1220140800,2,973,4.6395348837209305
2966529,4,B000WBZ5Z2,"This is one of the great classic britcoms, and should be seen by all! It's hilarious. However, there are so many running jokes that you should start at season 1 or they won't make sense.",1208822400,,186,4.3428571428571425
2966560,4,B000WBZ5Z2,"Further episodes of this amusing series.
Purists may be appalled at some of the changes of cast (Lt. Bertorelli and M. LeClerc), but one at least was unavoidable (due the untimely death of Jack Haig, the actor who played LeClerc). The actor who plays Rene Artois ( Gordon Kaye) sports a rather spectacular scar on the forehead in this series, due to a tree falling on him on 25th January 1990 during the spectacular storms in the UK, but the fun carries on as usual. The whole thing is a parody of a serious BBC TV series called ""Secret Army"" which was all about a cafe run by a prominent member of the Resistance. Lt Hans Gering makes a welcome return as a British Intelligence Officer and even Winston Churchill makes a cameo appearance. I did hear that Germans loved this series and I imaginee that the French were probably baffled by it. Strangely enought the British, who made it, are portrayed as complete idiots (e.g. the British airmen and the dreadful French spoken by the fake Gendarme Crabtree - ""Good Moaning"", which shows that the British still have the endearing quality of laughing at themselves.",1208736000,3,1111,4.673469387755102
2966561,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"What can I say, this is a wonderful series. Funny as hell. But you need to see it from the beinging to really appreciate all of the references, to other shows, made by the actors. You don't have to be British or even like BritComs to have a laugh at this DVD.  CHEERS!",1207785600,2,268,4.056603773584905
2966562,1,B000WBZ5Z2,"I have been looking forward to every new series being made available, but series No 7 is a big let-down, mainly because of too many changes in (A)the charactors we all got to love and (B) the plot has become tired - too many ""situations"" of the past being repeated, and this made me decide not to buy series 8 and those which may follow. I will rather start watching all over from series 1 chapter 1 to get all the fantastic laughs all over again.",1206662400,5,447,4.209302325581396
2966563,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"I was worried that the humor might start to get old by the 7th series of this great show, but I was wrong. It's as fresh as ever, and with some fun surprises, like an appearance of Capt. Hans Goering. The new actor playing the Italian captain only takes about 2 scenes to get used to, then you forget there was someone else originally in the role. I can't wait for series 8!",1204243200,2,374,4.136986301369863
2966564,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"For those of us who were rabidly enthralled with the first few series seen on PBS, being able to view what amounts to PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN episodes of our favorite Britcom is like finding an extra $20 in your wallet when you thought you were broke.",1203811200,,245,4.466666666666667
2966565,4,B000WBZ5Z2,This is another excellect Allo Allo series.  It's a shame Captain Bertorelli is a different actor but the series is still full of hysterical moments.,1203206400,,149,4.96
2966566,5,B000WBZ5Z2,Nobody takes the mickey out of the French like the Brits can and no Brits did it better than the cast of 'Allo 'Allo. My only regret is that the last 2 seasons of it aren't available yet.,1202860800,,187,3.9473684210526314
2966567,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"'Allo 'Allo is one of the all-time best britcoms.  It combines wit, adult innuendo and outright hilarity with a concept which has caused international controversy and intellectual reflection while taking the viewer on an easy yet wild ride.  The show uses the unusual format for a sitcom of developing a storyline from the very first episode.  Thus, it should be watched in order from the first episode of the first series.  There are running gags reminiscent of the style used in predecessors such as ""Get Smart."" The subject matter is best suited to mature audiences.  Enjoy!",1202428800,,577,4.96875
2966568,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"The previous season was somewhat dry, now this one has a loadful of very funny jokes, some unexpected adventures of Rene and, albeit, another Capitan Bertolli, though the previous one was better, imho, and as the punch-line Michelle of the Resistance starts regulary taking money from Rene's cafe cash, thus sincerely disclosing the real nature and motivation of all those so called ""resistance"" and ""liberation"" armed gangs.",1201824000,,425,5.358208955223881
2966569,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"Set in the second World War this is the next release of a send up of the French Resistance during the German occupation of France, and covers the escapades of Rene Artois, a French Resturant owner. He is a chance ""Hero of the French Resistance"" but is really more interested in taking chances with the hot blooded flirtations of his waitresses - and less interested in his wife and mother-in-law with whom his short verbal exchanges never amount to much more than, ""Shut Up! You Silly Old Bat"".
It is made funnier by a German Leutenant who ""is mad about the boy"" - but of course one needs intrigue and skullduggery with stolen art and the ""Gestoopo"" who are always trying to catch the plot but usually miss it.
A superb series that really must be part of your video collection.
The frustrating part about buying these DVD's is that the distributor cannot do the honourable thing and release the entire series in one release. The excuse for this may well be marketing but this does not enhance my opinion of them for this policy. Hurry up and release the rest of the series, you idle slackers!!!!!",1193875200,11,1096,4.568527918781726

The 'Complete Series Seven' features the return appearance of Capt.

The show uses the unusual format for a sitcom of developing a storyline from the very first episode.  Thus, it should be watched in order from the first episode of the first series.  There are running gags reminiscent of the style used in predecessors such as ""Get Smart."" The subject matter is best suited to mature audiences.  Enjoy!",1202428800,,577,4.96875
3201065,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"The previous season was somewhat dry, now this one has a loadful of very funny jokes, some unexpected adventures of Rene and, albeit, another Capitan Bertolli, though the previous one was better, imho, and as the punch-line Michelle of the Resistance starts regulary taking money from Rene's cafe cash, thus sincerely disclosing the real nature and motivation of all those so called ""resistance"" and ""liberation"" armed gangs.",1201824000,,425,5.358208955223881
3201066,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"Set in the second World War this is the next release of a send up of the French Resistance during the German occupation of France, and covers the escapades of Rene Artois, a French Resturant owner. He is a chance ""Hero of the French Resistance"" but is really more interested in taking chances with the hot blooded flirtations of his waitresses - and less interested in his wife and mother-in-law with whom his short verbal exchanges never amount to much more than, ""Shut Up! You Silly Old Bat"".
It is made funnier by a German Leutenant who ""is mad about the boy"" - but of course one needs intrigue and skullduggery with stolen art and the ""Gestoopo"" who are always trying to catch the plot but usually miss it.
A superb series that really must be part of your video collection.
The frustrating part about buying these DVD's is that the distributor cannot do the honourable thing and release the entire series in one release. The excuse for this may well be marketing but this does not enhance my opinion of them for this policy. Hurry up and release the rest of the series, you idle slackers!!!!!",1193875200,11,1096,4.568527918781726

8222448,5,B000WBZ5Z2,"""Allo Allo!"" Has been around since 1982 and has become available in the USA on a decent media. Many more episodes than originally aired in the USA are available.

Basic story is of a caf owner Ren Artois (Gorden Kaye); this is in France during the WWII German occupation. He must balance dealing with the local Germans, the Gestapo, the good Resistance, the commie Resistance, having affairs with his female help, dealing with his wife and mother-in-law.

In series seven the fun does not stop. However you see some different people and different actors playing some of the key characters. A few of the originals are left including a token appearance of Captain Hans Geering (Sam Kelly) in a surprisingly new position after a little brainwashing. As With the last series (six), one can tell that they are running out of ideas and in desperate effort to keep up the energy go a little over the deep end even for ""Allo Allo."" Then all of a sudden even the new substitute actors catch on and we are back in the laughs and situations. Herr Otto Flick finds a new love worthy of the Gestapo. Now I can not wait for series eight.

One nice thing about this series is that they place the name next to the actor at the end of each episode. Most of the actors are well known out side of this series. I was shocked however to find that Gestapo Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) Played British Capt. Newman in Ken Follett's ""The Key to Rebecca"" (1985) and completely changed his accent.",1509148800,4,1474,4.533834586466165
