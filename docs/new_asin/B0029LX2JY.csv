3877673,1,B0029LX2JY,"horrible movie.  the only good thing about movie is the dad from american pie plays the elementary school teacher.  i was tempted to actually buy this, than found it on netflix. so glad i didn't buy it.",1265068800,,202,4.4324324324324325
3877674,2,B0029LX2JY,"Ok, first off, he's not a monster, although he's billed as one.  Everywhere I have seen Gooby described, the word ""monster"" is used, but he is just a very large teddy bear.  My children were expecting a monster and got an oversized stuff animal.  I disliked how lots of the situations were handled and also thought the ending was unsatisfactory.  I just wasn't happy with this one.",1263254400,,381,4.641791044776119
3877675,5,B0029LX2JY,"My kids didn't know I was getting them this movie called ""Gooby"" because I was keeping it a real secret from them. Lucky for me, a few days after the movie's official release, K-Mart already had the DVD in the $2.99 n' Under Bargain Area, so I snatched it up and wrapped it up and waited for a special day to reveal the DVD to my children. I wished it was on VHS because we only have a VCR and I have to borrow a DVD player from a neighbor whenever we rent or buy DVD's, but I figured this was a special occasion so ""why the heck not?""

So just when the time was right (on the anniversary of a family member's death), I made a big deal and unwrapped the ""Gooby"" DVD in front of my children. Their first reactions were things like, ""What is that bear on there?"" and ""Do we have to watch this now?"" My kids had no idea what they were in for (obviously!), but I had a hunch we were all in for a treat.

So I sat them down, figured out the DVD thing, and started the movie. An hour later, I found myself enjoying the movie so much, I didn't notice that one of my kids had fallen asleep, another was reading comic books, and my other one had left the house (apparently).

Whatever.

So I rounded them up again and started the movie over (even though I really wanted to know how it ended) and I made them watch the movie front to back, beginning to finish, like my dad taught me how to watch movies a long time ago (before he died).

Which brings me to another good point of this movie and that is fathers. Gooby learns that having a dad and being a dad are sometimes different things and he tries to teach the child in the movie that, too. I think that was a nice thing for the writers to write into the movie. Things like that are cool for people of any age to know!

Now, I may be a father of 3 teenage boys and girls, but I think I know a good family movie when I see one and this is it! I am a ""Gooby"" fan for life and I promise to make sure my family watches this movie every holiday so we can keep remembering Gooby's lessons about love, family, and relationships.

I have only one question/regret and that is how the movie ends, with Gooby getting back into his spaceship and saying that he is going to find E.T. and Alf to start a band. I think that was a silly part that might be confusing for children who might not know who those other alien beings are. So I hope in the sequel ""Gooby 2,"" they choose to go in a different direction with the story. Also, I think some of the deaths in the movie were handled strangely and more attention needs to be paid to that detail in future versions of this movie.

Thanks. Brock.",1253059200,7,2623,4.05019305019305
3877676,4,B0029LX2JY,"It's a wonderful family film depicting the insecurities of a child made worse by new, unfamiliar surroundings and how a make-believe friend helps him grow up and gain confidence. Also, portrays busy professinal parents who love their child, but miss the most important element in their family - giving of themselves and time spent together rather than material possessions.",1252800000,5,373,5.338983050847458

To have the physical manifestation of this boy's unraveled mind be the man-bear from The Shining is one of many ways the filmmaker reveals his genius.

3877705,4,B0029LX2JY,"Willy is a stock coming of age kid with stock coming of age problems.  Not only has he been forced to move from his early childhood home, he's facing stock redheaded bullies, a stock British housekeeper who refuses to tolerate nonsense and pretty much dissapears by the third act for some reason, and stock workaholic parents who are so egregiously neglectful I honestly thought the father had died at one point.  Oh, and there are also two-headed purple aliens that materialize for some reason his shower.  Yeah, that's a thing.

While our childhood selves may have sought more conventional methods (therapy or rubbing some dirt on it spring immediately to mind,) our ""imaginative"" protagonist prays to a magical amulet he has for some reason and it turns Gooby, a teddy bear he'd abandoned at his childhood home, into a furry with a Scottish accent who hunts him down and wants to be his new pal.

The amulet, like the British nanny/housekeeper, is never explained or mentioned again.  Willy and the rest of the cast not only fail to mistake Gooby for a man in a bear suit and have him arrested, but are for some reason perfectly cool living in a universe where teddy bears come to life, requiring zero explanation or time for adjustment.  That's right; I said the rest of the cast, because unlike Calvin and Hobbes or even Drop Dead Fred, Gooby operates in the communal reality, one in which people are either oblivious to a 6'2 man in a terrifying fursuit, or are perfectly cool with his hanging out with a young, impressionable, and arguably delusional child.

Let me say that again.  An amulet turns a kid's stuffed bear into the mascot of a terrifying Chuckie Cheese ripoff and the only person who cares is Eugene Levy, the Ferris Bueller-esque teacher who dedicates his time to busting up Gooby and Willy's heartwarming monkeyshines by taking pictures of them in an effort to get famous (I guess in their world, furries are rarer than Bigfoot.)

The sad thing is that this could have been a good film.  If you properly explained the amulet's powers and limitations, made it central to the plot, handed Eugene Levy some good lines (and a purpose in the plot,) worked a bit more on the pacing, focused a bit more on the family dynamics prior to the third act, and either made the 6' talking bear either purely imaginary, or had people react a bit more naturally towards him, this could have been a spiritual successor to Calvin and Hobbes (or at least Mannequin.)  As it was, this was family-friendly cheese on the level of  Santa Clause Conquers the Martians or Killer Klowns from Outer Space ( Gooby's character design may have been more appropriate to either.)",1429747200,2,2669,4.713978494623656

3877712,5,B0029LX2JY,"I've watched numerous children and family movies throughout my life, and 'Gooby' is one that sticks out the most. It's not because of the monster named Gooby's loveable smile, heartwarming jokes, or example-setting morals; instead it is the heartwarming moments Gooby spends with our protagonist, Willy, a troubled young man who is suffering from a mild form of schizophrenia. As we learn right away in 'Gooby', Willy has more problems than just his mental disorder. Willy's father no longer takes any interest in or spends time with him.

With an all-star cast consisting of David James Elliott (JAG), Eugene Levy (American Pie), Robbie Coltrane (Harry Potter) and up-and-coming young star Matthew Knight (My Babysitter's a Vampire) this movie is as can't-miss as it gets these days.

The kids will watch 'Gooby' over and over again, laughing at all the silly antics Gooby and Willy get themselves into, and the parents will laugh right along with them, soaking in all the clean, fun-spirited jokes that target both kids and adults.",1318204800,2,1033,5.106508875739645
