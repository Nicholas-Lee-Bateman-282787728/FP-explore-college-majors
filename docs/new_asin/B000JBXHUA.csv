For those who are lonely at Christmas time, this will sooth your soul.",1432080000,,348,4.523809523809524

We were reminded that the real meaning of Christmas is not about parties or money. Also, the length of the movie is just right at about 45 minutes.",1257811200,8,315,4.543859649122807
8149507,5,B000JBXHUA,"This is a touching story about the true meaning of Christmas.  It presents the Gospel accurately and is very, very well made.  I would also highly recommend the story of Noah and the Pilgrim's Progress by Scott Cawthon.",1199664000,9,219,4.7368421052631575
