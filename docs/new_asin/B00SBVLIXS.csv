8698024,5,B00SBVLIXS,"I have been using this video every morning for 5 months now (I first used the free version on amazon prime, until this updated DVD came out).  I definitely have more flexibility and less muscle soreness after working out.  The stretching gets me ready physically for my day.  It wasn't that easy at first, but I stuck with it, and now I can do the entire routine myself without prompting.",1427155200,14,388,4.514285714285714
