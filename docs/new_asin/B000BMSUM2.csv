8173247,4,B000BMSUM2,"This is one of Libertad Lamarque's greatest film because it mixes to perfection the melodrama genre with some of the greatest popular music written in the 20th century.  Consequently the lady had a great opportunity to display all her wares in the acting and singing departments.

""Amor en la Sombra"" (Love in the Shadows) was shot in Mexico in 1960 and was very successful at the box office revalidating once more Miss Lamarque's  everlasting popularity in the Spanish speaking world.  In fact the lady had been on top of the movie game since 1936 when she had her first international blockbuster with the film ""Ayudame a Vivir"" made in her native Argentina.  In order to gage Libertad's amazing longevity in show business we should remember that she started out as a stage actress in 1921, made her first recordings in 1928 and her film debut in a 1930 silent.

Now that I've established the star's pedigree let's move along to the film itself.  ""Amor en la Sombra"" can be considered as Mexico's answer to Hollywood's ""Back Street"" the 1932 tearjerker which was remade in 1941 and was about to be remade again in 1961.  This time the Mexican producers were one step ahead and without batting an eye or even referring to the original Fannie Hurst novel came up with their own musical version as a vehicle for Miss Lamarque. The storyline was changed a bit probably to avoid copyright lawsuits but the main theme remained the same: a woman agrees to live in the shadows as the mistress of a married man. Director Tito Davison was able to come up with a decent film full of suspense, drama and the most wonderful tangos including ""Galleguita"", ""Adios"", ""Adios Pampa Mia"" and ""Mi Buenos Aires Querido"" all sung by the magnificent Miss Lamarque in her unique dramatic style.

The title of this review ""The Great Libertad in Shadows"" does not refer to the movie title but to the quality of the DVD which leaves a lot to be desired in both image and sound.  Unfortunately that is the rule in most Mexican DVDs since producers and distributors do absolutely nothing in restoring their classic films for the home video market. The offender in this case is Laguna Films, a Mexican owned firm based in California. I said it before and I say it again: BOOOO to them!",1322611200,,2256,4.674242424242424
