7795866,3,155658427X,"I actually found this movie to be pretty good. It flowed pretty well and the story was almost solid. It's a true story about a boy who is doing whatever he can do to impress a girl so he can get in her pants. A noble endeavor, however, this task is not as easy as he may have origionaly thought. Turns out the panties he's chasing happen to belong to a sociopath who encourages him and at some point basically forces him to commit violent crimes.
There is another girl who he is courting who is the good girl of the movie. The one you're rooting for but are equally as frustrated with because she won't... well you get the picture.
Me being who I am could only really conentrate on the poor guys lady situation rather than the crimes he was commiting. In the end I just felt bad that the poor guy never got any. And I think that was the most tramatic thing for me. But, if you can get over that little tidbit (which i might assume most mature adults or even teenagers can do) than this is actually a pretty decent movie.",1273708800,,1020,4.182741116751269
