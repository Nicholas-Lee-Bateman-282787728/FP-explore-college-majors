8273878,4,B0019EV01Y,"'Long Pig' should have been called 'Long Movie'! This is one seriously long movie that stretches out the usual hour and a half premise of a slasher movie to monstrous length. Still, it's never boring thanks to Carlo Rodriguez's directing style which is steeped in montages, smooth dissolves and copious amounts of eerie stock footage from slaughterhouses and various horrifying world events. The script is decent if only a bit preachy but it works well and the characters aren't nearly a obnoxious as you usually see in micro budget horror movies. There is always a sense of movement in this lengthy flick which helps it feel like an epic and there are a few nice and twisted 'Saw' style torment scenes with some truly creepy looking villains. One bizarre scene in particular features a nasty old guy trying to kill a woman who is hiding in a room by attacking her through a hole in the wall with a chainsaw attached to the end of a pole! There are several other WTF moments like this just to keep you on your toes. It's too bad they didn't have much of a budget. Rodriguez is clearly a talented and stylistic director whose work is interesting enough to keep track of. Now, will somebody please give this guy a decent budget?!?",1300838400,2,1228,4.6118721461187215
8273879,3,B0019EV01Y,"Long Pig (Carlo Rodriguez, 2008)

In many ways Long Pig, the first film from director Carlos Rodriguez, is exactly the film you think it is--torture porn. And yet in so many other ways, most of them intriguing, it isn't. I'm not going to herald Long Pig as the next microbudget gem like Baby Blues or Lockout, but there's certainly more than enough here to warrant you seeing it.

Trying to give you a synopsis of this plot is reaching, naturally. It involves a twisted old TV preacher type guy (the late George H. Russell, the movie's executive producer) who has a thing for getting his dietary cholesterol from the freshest sources possible. He also commands a small army of balaclava-clad commandos from his church/home, isolated in the woods. There are also three different bunches of college students: the jocks who are only interested in alcohol and sex, headed up by Frank (Asad Durrani, who previously directed the film Cup of Joe, which features about half this movie's cast); the geeks, who are planning on crashing the big Halloween party; and the ladies. Featured in this last bunch is Kick (Jennifer Landenburg in her first screen role), whom Frank recently dumped, and her roommate. In any case, it all ends up with the whole bunch of them (those that survived the first assault, anyway) ending up in crazy TV preacher guy's compound, needing to escape, etc.

First off, I have to give kudos to anyone who's willing to make a horror film that stretches more than two hours in today's ninety-minutes-and-out horror culture. Long Pig (the body of the film itself; there's a piece tacked onto the end as a dedication) runs a little over 2:10, and that's surprising. Part of the reason it runs so long is the main thing about the movie I'm impressed with: the script. I grant you, it lacks a lot of the qualities I prefer to find in my scripts (most notably characterization), but Rodriguez and Russell, who co-wrote the screenplay, had some interesting questions to ask about human nature and the parallels between torture porn and modern American culture. (The fact that the answers Rodriguez gives to these questions are so muddled only adds to the appeal, at least for me.) This tends to slow the movie down, especially during its first half, but I had no problems with that at all. There's a lot to digest, and that's especially true when your stable of psycho food runs to fifteen characters, some of whom are more philosophical than others.

Two other things that may make you as happy as they made me, I don't know, but I'll throw them out there. First: while most of the actors in this movie range from very bad to so-awful-they-should-star-in-a-Night of the Lepus-remake, the women are astoundingly hot. All of them. (Which makes the movie's surprising lack of gratuitous nudity somewhat depressing, even if it's a refreshing change from most of the low-budget horror flicks I've seen; most of the ladies who find themselves on the operating table are still wearing their underclothes.) Also, and I think this may be my single favorite thing about the movie, one of the geeks has a T-shirt that says ""Uwe Boll ate my dingo."" If you get the humor in that sentence, I suspect you will be amused by this flick.

Now, the down sides. I've already mentioned the acting. Some folks will be turned off by the movie's pace; your mileage may vary. Similarly, the movie has some problems getting its environmental/anticapitalist point across. I actually consider this one of the movie's strong points; message media too often ends up being heavy-handed crap. The way I see it, Rodriguez kind of backed into genius with the way he handled all that. (The final scene is a bit overbearing, but given that it's the payoff for the whole movie, and it is still entirely in character, I'm willing to let that one slide.) Rodriguez is not a bad director, especially for his first time out, but there were a few shots that seemed like they could have been blocked a whole lot better, and some of the camerawork was just painful (there's one scene in particular--[censored for Amazon consumption]--that made me wonder if the guy holding the camera wasn't really, really drunk while shooting that scene). Still, for a first effort, and especially a first effort of this length, it's not a bad movie at all. If you're a horror fan, it's worth checking out. ** ",1268697600,2,4358,4.765562913907285
8273880,1,B0019EV01Y,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It makes Wrong Turn look like an academy award winner! With that said, it'll probably become some kind of cult classic.",1256515200,,176,4.205882352941177
8273881,1,B0019EV01Y,"The first time I had the pleasure of watching this movie I was left speechless. I watched it with one of the filmmakers in their own living room. If there was supposed to be some part of the movie that was for the horror enthusiasts or political reformers, please let me know. I think it must have been hidden in all the unnecessary exploits of naked women. Long Pig does not even have a plot line that their own script writers could follow. All I gathered from it was a few random stories of college kids partying, and completely non-related cannabalistic deaths. Overall, I feel like I wasted 3 hours of my life on a video of Girls Gone Wild: Horror Movie Style. I believe that this movie is more for Mystery Science Theater 3000 enthusiasts rather than horror enthusiasts and if by a political statement they mean taking 3 hours to say nothing at all then sure!",1234828800,,864,4.474683544303797
8273882,5,B0019EV01Y,"This movie has to be one of the most disturbing, disgusting, ridiculously awesome pieces of independent cinema ever to come out of the bayou country.  The dark fairytale begins depicting the broken lives of various college students.  Some are desperately seeking acceptance, others are trying to find there way in life, and want nothing more than to fulfill their hedonistic desires via sex, alcohol, and drugs.  Soon, however, despite all their differences, they find they have one thing in common...the fight to stay alive.

Sadistic cannibals descend upon the college kids and chaos ensues.  The drama, the violence, the sex, the drugs, will to survive.  All these are major components that create this fairytale turned nightmare.  From the powerful opening to the climactic finish, the movie will have you disturbed.  Not for the faint of heart.",1212969600,4,849,5.1911764705882355
8273883,4,B0019EV01Y,"Long Pig the Movie is an idea born of Producer George H. Russell while fighting the corruption of government and Sam Houston Electric Coop (SHECO) aimed at his family and ultimately contributing to the death of his mother, Marjorie Haw Russell, in 2007.  It is a powerful satire about how politicians, business executives and sometimes even religion systematically 'cannibalizes' the very people they are entrusted with protecting and serving.

Graphic scenes of blood, murder, sex and nudity.  Not for the faint of heart.  A 'must see' for true Horror Film enthusiasts.  A 'must see' for those seeking political reform.  Never has the battle of political corruption been made into such a graphic statement before.  The Trans Texas Corridor is one example of this.

One of the most important parts of the movie is the deathbed interview with Marjorie Haw Russell at the end.",1210982400,3,874,5.062937062937063
