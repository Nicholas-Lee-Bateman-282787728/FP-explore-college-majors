5183644,5,B008UZ1JSE,"I liked this series very much.  I had some difficulty with Dr. Hovind's anti-Catholic slant in a few statements he made. But even then II liked the series so much I bought a number of them to send out as Christmas gifts this year. But I did not buy them from this seller. The DVD quality is excellent but the labels leave much to be desired. They look like there was little care taken to give them that professional look. The images are distorted and washed out. That is sad because the video and audio reproduction is very professional.  I found the same level of excellent quality of these disks but with much better labels, The labels provided that professional touch. But the entire set was only $25 on e-bay. That is half the price of what I paid for these.",1356307200,2,762,4.397163120567376
5183645,5,B008UZ1JSE,"I have watched three of the series, which is seven DVD's.
Kent Hovind is an outstanding communicator and clearly
shows how evolution is a myth and a lie. He reveals how
schools throughout the U.S. are imposing this false
""religion"" upon our students. He also makes it clear
that it is not illegal for a teacher or professor to teach
the creation theory, that is, the biblical story. The
ACLU may threaten a school, but they have no legal
right to enforce their lowly tactics.",1356048000,4,475,4.6

8530665,1,B008UZ1JSE,"If I could rate these bogus videos of voodoo witchdoctor science a negative number, I would in a heartbeat.

Do you want a version of biology, physics, geology and countless other scientific disciplines to be warped, changed, altered from the mainstream (meaning what the rest of reality uses) scientific world to be mixed together and attempt to point out supposed flaws? Then by all means, watch these video collections.

Hovind has no problem setting up his own versions of strawman biology, geology, physics, and knocking them down with more strawman answers. Then his cult followers can claim victory over the supposed 'evolutionists', which, even a majority of his cult couldn't even tell you basic things, like what an amino acid is, or why you have an appendix. So it is a victory, a victory for stupidity.

Hovind also commits academic dishonesty by freely quote mining papers (from decades ago) and/or not citing it correctly, making it difficult for people to track down the article. (For example, see his Carbon 14 video with Mollusk Shells). Of course, when I found the paper, it freely states that you cannot use Carbon dating on Mollusk shells because of how Mollusks operate in the food chain. (This was written 40 years ago).

Creationists, especially young earth creationists like Hovind, are dangerous to the advancement of civilization. They live in a land of make believe fueled by myths and legends passed down from illiterate iron age sociopaths. Evolution is as valid as the theory of relativity. Both have stood up to scrutiny by the scientific community worldwide and both stand as important achievements in the lexicon of human knowledge. Such achievements and future scientific achievements are jeopardized by the 'religionists' who fear that they will lose their invisible sky daddy who looks over them and protects them.",1403654400,,1850,5.1158940397351

8530668,4,B008UZ1JSE,"I haven't watched it yet, but I bought this to replace a set that I had and gave a friend. If you like to learn you'll love it too. Very interesting.",1390780800,,149,3.838709677419355
8530669,5,B008UZ1JSE,"It is a series all should watch. He gives good solid proof that the geologic column, fossils, dinosaurs in relation to man,  and the so called millions of years the evolutionists use are not true.  Coal, petrified wood, oil and fossils do not take millions of years to form!!
Did you know that there are actual footprints of dinosaurs and man together in Texas?  Our family loved how he makes sense of the Biblical flood , the Grand Canyon, Mt. St. Helen's eruption and how fast petrified wood is forming, the frozen mammoths, etc.  There is so much information on this set. If you are an agnostic or evolution believer just listen and watch with an open mind and you will be amazed! Parents this is a real family conversation started with your school age kids, especially Jr High and up!",1386547200,6,788,4.567375886524823

8530672,5,B008UZ1JSE,We loved Kent Hovind Creation Series. He is great and knows what he is talking about. We need to show this to as many people as possible. Christain need to demand the truth to be taught in our schools!,1372204800,2,201,4.17948717948718
