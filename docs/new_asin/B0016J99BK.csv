3157092,1,B0016J99BK,I have found similar sets for a fraction than what's being asked for here. Unfortunately I was unable to get my hands on a set before it went flying off the shelves so I came looking for it here at Amazon. Here I find the only set available is outrageously over priced so much so that when divided by three the average price for each season is well over what each season actually costs. Nice job seller!,1196294400,35,403,4.246753246753247

8262679,5,B0016J99BK,Love house and loved watching these dvds. Passed them onto my son to watch. I may watch them again.,1288828800,,99,4.2631578947368425
8262680,5,B0016J99BK,It was shipped after 1 business day. Got here OK. It was what I ordered.,1257811200,,72,3.8666666666666667
8262681,5,B0016J99BK,"I think the main actors, plot and premise of the TV series is really done in an excellent way. The trouble-shooting is done in such a fashion that is not always politically correct, yet when all is said and done the patients are cured. House leads a think tank of M.D.'s that use eloquent way to cure patients",1257638400,,309,4.344827586206897
8262682,3,B0016J99BK,"I am very concerned, as all 3 seasons are shrinked wrapped in plastic that say ""made in Mexico.""  These shipped from someone other than Amazon. Although I have purchased many DVD's from Amazon, I have never read the word ""Mexico"" on the back.  They also are not a ""package"" but individual seasons.",1236729600,,297,4.6923076923076925
8262683,5,B0016J99BK,"Dr. House is in the house!!  Excellent DVD set to own forever and always.  Worth the price just for the blooper scenes.  The book is nice, but not absolutely necessary, unless you're into assorted complicated medical conditions.  We watch House for the puzzle-solving factor, the plot lines and the genius comedic role of Dr. Gregory House.  The conditions themselves are a nice by-product, but overall, they just make me more of a hypochondriac than I already am.",1232236800,,464,4.974025974025974
8262684,5,B0016J99BK,"Well worth buying.  You will watch this series over and over again.
The characters are well rounded with their own mystery.  Each episode can stand alone yet there is a through line that keeps you coming back.  This series will reapear as reruns on TV for years to come.  Buy this series and skip the advertisements.  A true masterpiece of television.",1228089600,,351,4.688524590163935
8262685,5,B0016J99BK,"House is the perfect tv show for anyone who likes dry, sarcastic, biting humor. Laurie also brings an edge to this show that is not rivaled by any other actor on television.

Honestly, this is such a good show that you will not want to stop watching it for anything. The 3-pack is perfect because it comes at a slight discount per season, and also allows for hour upon hour of intelligent fun.

As for the supporting cast, however, they are great in the second season, but start getting old come season 3, but that is okay, seeing as the cast changes around a bit in season 4.

This is an absolute riot of a show, and I would never hesitate to recommend this product to anyone looking for high-quality entertainment.",1219104000,,716,4.450381679389313
8262686,5,B0016J99BK,"The quality of the product is just great. The serie itself is completely wonderful, I wanna marry Dr. House!!!",1215388800,,110,4.842105263157895
8262687,5,B0016J99BK,I love this show too.....I'm a medical doctor and watching ER and Scrubs sometimes used to make me sick because things were sooooooooooooo unreal...on the other hand...House is closer to real life without the bitter attitude of House and without the drug dependence on Vicodin( sniffing...come one give me a break)...even though you will be surprise with the stories that I've heard on the medical community...,1210723200,4,410,5.2272727272727275
