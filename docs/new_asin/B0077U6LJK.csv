8562219,5,B0077U6LJK,"""Roosevelt and Rufus"" is a love letter to character and tradition.  It honors a man and a city.  It gives us the joy of seeing someone making a living at something that brings HIM joy.  In its own way, this film salutes the American dream.

Roosevelt Upshaw is a horse-and-carriage tour guide in the small, history-rich town of St. Augustine, Florida, the country's oldest city.  In the first half of this 66-minute documentary we learn about how he came to his position, his relationship with his horse Rufus, and much inside information about his trade.

The second half highlights the actual tour that Roosevelt provides to his patrons.  We quickly discover he is a gifted raconteur with a talking rhythm that is as easy on the ear as the beauty of this ""ancient"" city is easy on the eye.  The filmmaker Bruce Merwin takes full advantage of his medium by enhancing the tour with numerous close-up images described by our engaging guide.  That alone would make this film worth the proverbial price of admission.

But I would especially recommend ""Rufus and Roosevelt"" to anyone who wonders, ""Whatever happened to the American spirit?""  It is alive and well and driving a buggy around St. Augustine, Florida.",1344384000,2,1209,4.848780487804878
8562220,5,B0077U6LJK,"We got this video recently and really enjoyed it. St. Augustine is our favorite vacation spot and we have been going there for over 30 years. When we saw Roosevelt and Rufus, the video about the tour guide and his horse and carriage, we were amazed at how it really captures the magic of the many tours we have taken in St. Augustine. It is clear that Roosevelt and Rufus both know the Ancient City well and enjoy sharing the stories with visitors. Bruce Merwin has caught the pair on his video and brings them to life for all of us to enjoy. The carriage tours are such fun that people do not mind doing them many times. With this video we can even enjoy the tour when we are at home and imagine the fun we will have when we return to St. Augustine. This will help keep the story alive for years!
