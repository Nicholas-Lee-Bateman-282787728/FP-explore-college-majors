8017098,4,B0001WTV8E,Gary Daniels if a pretty good action star but the movie is not that bad you just won't remember it after a bit,1471996800,,110,3.8260869565217392
8017099,3,B0001WTV8E,"Gary Daniels' first experience as a solo performer in America was as the premier star of Cine Excel Entertainment - a firm that was lucky to have him but largely lacked the means to create compelling vehicles for him. While&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Capital-Punishment/dp/B0001WTVAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Capital Punishment</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-Impact/dp/B0001WTVE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full Impact</a>&nbsp;had little more going for them than a plethora of fight scenes, ""American Streetfighter"" has that plus a little extra. These three stars might be slightly charitable, but if you want to investigate the British Danger Man's work as a standalone guy from this period, this is the least among the evils.

The story: A Hong Kong businessman (Daniels) returns to America to deliver his brother (Ian Jacklin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Expert-Weapon/dp/6305138397/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Expert Weapon</a>) from an underground fighting circuit that hides a deadly secret.

The movie has the bare makings of a respectable action-adventure: director Phil Noir has an infinitely more skillful take on low-budget outings than his Cine Excel cohort David Huey (director of the aforementioned films), evident in a few interesting camera angles and far superior editing. There are plenty of faults and weird decisions for sticklers to criticize -obvious ADR dialogue and poor acting among them - but no part of this feature is so bad that established B-movie fans would desert it. Fans of weirdness will love when a child (Andrew Cooper) becomes Gary's workout instructor and a couple instances of over-the-top violence.

With its count of 17 fight scenes, the movie has plenty of opportunity to provide some neat brawls but fails several times. At worst, several fights lack a sense of pace or otherwise just drag. At best, the matches feature some pretty nice moves. While Ian Jacklin makes a habit of missing his opponents by a mile with his strikes, Daniels is better supported by a list of costars that includes Gerald Okamura (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Power-Within/dp/B000C8STMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Power Within</a>), Shaun Benjamin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Circuit-2/dp/B000A2X3KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Circuit 2</a>), and - for a single scene - Roger Yuan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Time-in-Vietnam/dp/B00JPFTWQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Time in Vietnam</a>), and everybody has at least one good punch-up. There's almost no action that isn't related to karate, save for an odd car chase highlighted by a good crash and an unconvincing stunt double for Gary flipping over a vehicle.

I can't recommend this movie above much of Daniels' later work, but for the record, our boy has done far worse.",1424563200,,3069,6.722921914357682
8017100,1,B0001WTV8E,"Fortunately I got this movie for free at the dvd store I visited.
So I took it and watched it. I realized why they were giving this away for free. It was boring, acting was awful, fight scenes were bland and you were so put off, you didn't care about the movie or how it ended.
I don't mind cheesy action flicks. This movie was cheesy in a BAD way.
This will be a waste of your time. I am glad I didn't waste a dime on this garbage.
I threw my copy in the trash where it belonged.",1246665600,,480,3.8585858585858586
8017101,2,B0001WTV8E,"Hmmm, what to say about Gary Daniels epic film American Streetfighter? Well for one thing it was filmed on the cheap, Low budget? Nope. Shoestring budget? Nope. Filmed in some guys basement? Yup. Seriously most of the ""sets"" look like some guys basement with a few boxes piled about and some xmas lights strung up, and for a little variety they film some stuff in a parking lot or some guys house in the middle of the desert.

Anyway, the film pretty much goes as follows, Gary as a young man is a bit of a punk, and after a firebombing gone bad he heads for the hills, or in this case Hong Kong. 10 years later he finds his brother is in some kind of trouble and heads back to the states. Seems his brother has involved himself in pitfighting for little extra cash (think bumfights but lower rent) Gary doesn't want him to do this so he takes his place, and quickly gets beaten like a rented mule by the ""champion"" Viper. Awakening in a hospital of sorts he sees things are not up to snuff as it seems that the bodies of dead fighters are being used to transport drugs overseas. That pretty much sums it up, tho' there are things about a long lost son, and love, old vendetas and a pretty cute chick named Reiko who meets a sad end :)

So if you have 7$ burning a hole in your pocket you might pick this up if only for some moderately good martial arts and alot of unintentional laughs.",1086220800,2,1387,4.230188679245283
