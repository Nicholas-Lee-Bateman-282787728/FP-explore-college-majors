8545872,3,B00A0APDWU,"Lam Ching-Ying returns to direct his own take on the Kung Fu Horror Comedy in VAMPIRE VS VAMPIRE! The One-Eyebrow Priest is hired to find the source of evil that is corrupting the town's water supply, which leads him into the crypt of a vicious new vampire who has taken up residence beneath the local church. VAMPIRE VS VAMPIRE, though not directly related to the MR. VAMPIRE films, acts very much in the same way. It is filled with more terrific humor, terrifying villains, and exciting action sequences. Lam Ching-Ying is as fantastic as ever playing the Taoist vampire hunter, and he brings along many other returning cast members from his previous films. There are many inventive moments that separate this from many other third-rate attempts, and Ching-Ying goes for real scares and laughs that don't always fall back on the same old slapstick routines. Some fans may question the inclusion of a traditional European vampire as the main villain, however this combination of East and West makes VAMPIRE VS VAMPIRE unique from all the rest. MR. VAMPIRE fans must be sure to seek out VAMPIRE VS VAMPIRE for more high-powered action and suspense!
