1716150,2,B000067J0U,"Korean cinema was all the rage in opening years of the 00's and this was one of the country's more popular offerings.  Perhaps because it was released at a time of such intense interest, when audiences and reviewers were waiting for the next big thing, or perhaps because of the marketing, no one wanted to find fault with Chingu.

But it isn't hard to do.

The film purports to tell the story of four school mate chums who grow up to lead very different lives but who remain friends throughout.  In fact the movie is about two boys who grow up to be gangsters working for rival syndicates and who quite predictably come into conflict later in the film.  The third boy, whose point of view frames the movie, is a studious achiever who goes on to get his PhD in the United States.  The fourth boy is thrown in simply for comic relief and we never learn very much about him.

The pace of the film is plodding, the music is overly sentimental and calls far too much attention itself (such as the weepy violins), you never really care much for any of the characters (who are, after all, drug sellers, murders, and pimps), the range of acting doesn't go beyond shades of sullen, the story is riddled with clich about loyalty and duty, and the whole idea that the PhD would remain friends with these two thugs is simply preposterous and an obvious conceit.  If it weren't for the lovely cinematography, this film would have nothing to recommend it.",1151884800,3,1442,4.498084291187739
1716151,5,B000067J0U,"This movie is fantastic. It shows the love of four friends and what they go through throughout there progessing lives. I love Jang Dong Gun and he is one of my favorite actors. He was awsome in Tae guk Gi,(which is my favorite movie of all time) and 2009 lost memories. amazing film!",1140998400,4,283,4.3584905660377355
1716152,3,B000067J0U,"Friend is a showing of 4 childhood friends as they grow into adults. The movie deals with honor, loyalty, and the question of what it truly means to being a friend. I had a couple of problems with this flick. I liked how the movie starts out but then it drags a bit in the middle. The acting in certain scenes is bad and had a bit too much of male sentimental melodrama for my liking. There are no guns in the movie which had me scratching my head (not that I need guns in a movie to enjoy it but they are gangsters after all). But the thing that really bothered me, although purely cosmetic, was the gangster friend Dong-su. He turns into a complete ripoff of Tony Montana. When I saw him in that outfit and posturing the way he was I was laughing and shaking my head at the same time. If you wanna see a Korean flick I'd go for Oldboy, Tae Guk Gi, or Attack the Gas Station.

3.5 stars",1128384000,5,887,4.0685714285714285
1716153,5,B000067J0U,This is one of the first movies Jang Dong Gun was in. He plays the only friend who breaks away from the original group. I don't want to give anything else away but yu're sure to recognize his Chow Yun Fat-esque style. If you like him and want to see him in some more action roles check out the excellent Taegukgi:The Brotherhood of War and the middling 2009:Lost Memories,1102723200,10,371,4.391304347826087

1716155,5,B000067J0U,"The director of this film made it as a tribute to his friends, and his love pours off the screen.  Cinematic influences like Guy Ritchie are noticeable, but not bastardized, in the inspired and intriguing cinematic style.  The performances grab you, and you cannot help but feel for the characters as they grow older and further apart, down their separate and often conflicting paths.  Plus, the fight scenes are completely HARDCORE and intense.  saivai is right, the final scenes are completely awesome, and they are only following a completely awesome film.  With FRIEND, Korean film enters into the gangster genre with a bang, or should I say a stab...",1093910400,11,655,4.972477064220183
1716156,4,B000067J0U,"A korean gangster movie.  It's about 4 guys and shows them from when they were kids.  Decisions they made as they were kids, made them what they are in the future.  Some humor and there wasn't a time I was bored of this film.  Great ending that keeps you thinking... why it had to end that way.",1092528000,13,294,4.105263157894737
1716157,5,B000067J0U,"This is one amazing film. This film has to be one of my favourites of the last few years, or more. I rented it... watched it twice then bought it.
The last half hour of the film left me with my jaw unhinged. Wow I thought... this film can be watched just for one of the most moving sequences in recent cinema. And every time I watch it, the last few scenes actually move me even more than the first time through. Can't say that for many other films.
But the ending isn't what makes this a great movie. For me it's the great friendship that is so powerful and up front, and actually draws the viewer into their little group that makes the film. Although the first half hour is slow, it all builds up to a point where you can see that these guys are the greatest of friends.
And it just gets better... and better and better.
Just simply an wonderful film. And I'm now hooked on Asian cinema.",1087689600,11,889,4.174418604651163

7963072,4,B000067J0U,"A good movie and an interesting view at some part of Korean society, soon after the war.
I particularly enjoyed the early years of this bunch of guys, while in Primary and Secondary School.
Later on it becomes more of a standard gangster/yakuza movie.
I will recommend it: 4 1/2 stars is a very fair assesment.",1337385600,,310,4.553571428571429
7963073,4,B000067J0U,"This Korean film follows the story of four friends, who met at school in the early 1980's. They stay friends and form tight bonds that come under strain through what appears to be a very harsh education system. They also have to face tough social and economic times as Korea struggled to become the Asian Tiger that we know of it in recent times.

As time passes their different career choices lead them to lose touch and in the end become bitter rivals at either end of the crime and social divide. It stars Jang Dong Kun , who you may remember from `Brotherhood'. He does an excellent job and all the actors are up to the standard that you would expect from Korean cinema. There are touches of humour and some quite visceral fight scenes, especially amongst the students. There is a lot of attention to period detail I especially like Blondie being played at the `roller disco'; yes don't you just love the eighties.

Director KT Kwak has done a really good job and there is some brilliant cinematography and as far as I could tell no CGI and really no need for it. I am a world cinema fan and so was looking forward to seeing this; it though, is not on a par with some other Asian and indeed Korean films. There could have been more done to engender empathy about the characters, but all that aside it was a satisfying 113 minutes. The title comes from the definition they discover of what a friend is, that being `a long and close companion'.  If you like Korean cinema you will not be disappointed but for a first foray into this area of cinema, this film is not a good place to start, I would go with `Brotherhood' or `Mother'.",1308441600,3,1633,4.382838283828383
7963074,4,B000067J0U,"I had to watch this film fro a group project in a sociology class.  Very intersting look into korean film making.  Kind of slow with intense random bouts of violence.  Check it out for an interesting foreign film, although I felt the story wasn't too fleshed out.  Shows how much they really value honor and friendship above all else.",1273449600,2,334,4.610169491525424
7963075,3,B000067J0U,"The story is simple; it's about four friends growing up in Pusan in the seventies. The real story comes from their weird mixture of personalities that fit but you don't expect to last after school. Jung-sook is the son of a mob boss and is the boss of his school and is said to be the best fighter in the school. His second boss Dong-su is suffering from being a follower and doesn't realize this until around the middle of the movie. Sang-taek is basically the genius nerd but Jung-sook likes him and protects him. Woon-taek is the class clown though he doesn't stand out that much. Every character has their own personality but only two really stand out and matter.

The film starts with the four but mainly focuses on Dong-su and Jung-sook for the remainder of the film. The two end up becoming part of rival gangs and must settle their problems, which will last and stay friends to the end? I have no idea where to start with friend because after a while its flaws come from what you want to happen and not what happens. One major thing is if Jung-sook's father is so feared then why doesn't he at least look it even a little. There is very little film shown on the family's relationship with the mob while Jung-sook was young. I also agree with some other reviewers that some things were unbelievable. The movie uses the frail relationship of Jung-sook and Sang-taek to keep the theme of friend going. All this movie needed was to keep the light on Jung-sook and Dong-su from beginning to end. The real friendship of the film was between Jung-sook and Dong-su.

Maybe the director didn't want this to truly be a gangster film but more of a drama but he should've gone gangster film all the way. If he did it completely in that style the film would've been way better. What's positive about ""Friend"" depends on what you like. I must agree that there were certain parts that I really enjoyed but mainly the end of the film. Some characters in the film that it could have benefited from went unfinished. Like Joong-ho who's character really needed more time in this movie didn't get it. The acting was pretty good which definitely kicks the films viewing worth up a notch. The music is awful and the picture quality is ok and could have been better but it works. This movie is more like 3.5 stars but If you've glanced at it in your video store every time you go in like me don't get it unless you've seen most of the other films available.",1181520000,,2442,4.448660714285714
