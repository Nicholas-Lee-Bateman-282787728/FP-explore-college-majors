2064297,4,B00026L9CA,"This documentary is well done but it is very narrow in scope.  Granddaughter/filmmaker Ivy Meeropol focuses her effort on trying to understand the grandparents she never knew through the eyes of her father Michael, eldest son of the Rosenbergs, his younger brother Robert, and through some of the Rosenberg's closest surviving friends.  A key element is the distance created by all other family members including distant relatives, even to this day.

This documentary assumes the viewer is intimate with the Rosenberg case, the fervor of McCarthyism, and the red scare -at least from the perspective of what the official story was.  With that assumption in place she tells the story from the inside out.  This is a moving side of the story to tell and at times a tough film to watch; however, it is not filled with the saccharine sentiment one may expect.

While this documentary is expectedly one-sided, surprisingly it is not totally absent scrutiny.  Ivy explores tough questions: Was Julius a communist?  Yes.  Was he a spy?  Yes.  Did he ever trade any secrets that compromised our national security or resulted in the death of any American?  Very hard to tell, but probably not.  Was Ethel a communist? Well, yes but mostly by association.  Was she a dedicated wife and mother?  My take is that she was more of a dedicated wife then mother, but I may be completely wrong.  She was put in a very tough position where every choice was a lose/lose.  All the government ever really had on her was being loyal to her husband.

This documentary may well upset supporters who view the Rosenbergs as leftist martyrs, as well as detractors who condemn them as agents of Stalin. I think it is clear that without Ethel's brother, David Greenglass as a key liar on the stand, a rabid call for the heads of communists, and a very politically charged case, the Rosenbergs would not have been executed.  A long prison sentence may well have been more appropriate.  As one political commentator pointed out, they died because they refused to confess and name others.  Someday, that may well turn out to be the truth.

There is no doubt that Communism -especially any Marxist based communism like Soviet Communism, is quite an atrocity against humanity; dare I say, it may have even been evil.  That said, should the Rosenbergs have died for their actions, or lack of action in the case of Ethel?  This documentary will not help one make the decision either way any easier.  It will, however, tell the lost story of those most intimately impacted by these executions. I am a strong advocate for the death penalty.  However, my position is mostly philosophical because it should be reserved for only the most heinous of violent criminals and under specific conditions.  It is cases like the Rosenberg's that creates murky confusion, not clarity, for the arguments for and against the death penalty.

For those familiar with the case, this is a great added dimension to understanding a complex and uncertain time in our history.",1149465600,25,3015,4.847358121330724
2064298,5,B00026L9CA,"Fifty years after Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed as spies, their granddaughter Ivy Meeropol made this film to understand her grandparents more intimately and humanly.

As a narrator, Meeropol offers charm and charisma.  In fact, the whole family seems incredibly normal and, well, nice. Her father and uncle, the Rosenberg sons, survived what many would view as childhood trauma: reading about their parents in the media, visiting their parents in prison, temporary stays in group homes. They were lucky  to live in a pre-pop-psych era and even luckier to be adopted by the loving Meeropols.

The Rosenberg sons always believed in the innocence of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Through release of formerly classified documents, it's obvious that Julius did some sort of spying. But realistically he probably was a small fish, in over his head, caught up in the government's search for a scapegoat.

Sure, Khruschev mentions the Rosenbergs in his biography, and Julius (but not Ethel) had a couple of code names, but another KGB agent came forward late in his life to say, ""They really didn't amount to much.""  And another accused party member, Miriam Moskowitz, questions the Venona documents when she's interviewed: mostly scraps, she says, except for the Rosenbergs'  very complete file.

Ivy's cousin Rachel, a newly-minted lawyer, summarizes the tragedy succinctly. Even if guilty, Ethel and Julius deserved a fair trial, and they didn't get one. The prosecutor engaged in illegal ex parte (out of court) communication with the judge. Ethel's brother David Greenglass has admitted he gave false testimony. The Rosenbergs were accused of accepting a console table with spy equipment; the table turned out to be what they claimed -- an ordinary table they bought at Macy's.

Would the Rosenbergs really have saved their lives if they had turned in their friends?  Would they have spent years in prison -- perhaps worse than the death sentence?  Was their sacrifice pointless?

The real question should be: Why did they have to make these choices?  I recommend watching this DVD along with Capturing the Friedmans, a documentary about a Jewish family accused of child abuse in the 1980's.  Once again, district attorneys offered reduced sentences in exchange for accusations.  And over and over again, people accused of drug dealing can get reduced sentences only by turning in others.  Ironically, those low on the chain often know nobody, or know only undercover agents, so they get longer sentences.

Originally, Ethel was arrested to motivate Julius to confess.  Even today prosecutors still attack wives in hopes of ""softening"" a husband, as in the case of one Enron executive.  When the husbands don't crumble, wives who were marginally (or not at all) involved are punished.

So I believe this film raises questions about the logistics of contemporary justice. When faced with long prison terms, many people will say anything to save themselves and their families. They'll  invent stories, which will become ""evidence"" against others, often without independent corroboration.  Prosecutors seem to have no qualms about punishing innocent people to nudge the guilty.

And jury verdicts often depend not on logic or reason but on whether they like the defendants. They didn't like Julius and Ethel. They were viewed as hard and detached. But most likely they thought the proceedings were ludicrous -- the table from Macy's was bugged? -- and never expected to be convicted.

Is this what ""innocent till proven guilty"" means? Do we want to convict criminals based on coerced testimony? Do we want verdicts based on folkloric beliefs about a defendant's demeanor?  Those are the real questions for viewers of this documentary.",1107734400,23,3737,5.209030100334449
2064299,5,B00026L9CA,"Heir to an Execution was directed by Ivy Meeropol, the grand daughter of the Rosenbergs.  The tragedy facing the Rosenbergs, their sons and their friends has left me with a lot of thoughts and emotions to process.  Is it possible that the Rosenbergs (or at least Ethel) were innocent or were they (or one of them) guilty of spying beyond what was discussed in court?  Did Ethel's brother really frame her to save his life? Would confessions, even fake ones, have spared the Rosenbergs' lives and prevent the tragic consequneces to their family (not all members of the family have behaved humanly, to say the least)?  What would have these confessions done to their friends and colleagues (some of them were actually imprisoned)? What was the role of public hysteria (if any) fed by politicians and the media? It is amazing to see how the Roesenbergs' children managed to grow up and have productive and balanced lives (thanks to their adoptive prents, the Meeropols). I was wondering what are the lessons we could learn from this story to our present time? The movie is sensitive and thought and emotion provoking. Thanks Ivy Meeropol for bringing this tragic and telling story to life.",1102118400,,1186,4.856435643564357
2064300,4,B00026L9CA,"It is true, as the Rosenberg's two sons and as the director of this film, the Rosenberg's granddaughter admits, available evidence does not clearly say that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife, were totally innocent of the charges against them and for which they were executed exactly sixty years ago in 1953. However, this film does reveal a lot. The Rosenbergs were charged with spying for Russia and revealing to the Soviet government information about the atomic bomb. But there was no real proof that they did so. The only real proof was that Ethel Rosenberg's brother said they did so. However, he later admitted on the 60 Minutes TV show that he lied. Apparently he lied to secure a smaller sentence; he served in jail for ten years. Additionally, the prosecution's case was filled with inconsistencies and mistakes.

In 1990, a Soviet document was found that mentions Julius Rosenberg, but not his wife Ethel. This, and the lack of proof otherwise, seems to indicate that the US government arrested her to put pressure on her husband; to get him to admit that he stole atomic bomb papers and gave them to Russia. Once the government arrested her, they executed her, even though there was no evidence that she did wrong.

The evidence seems to say that Julius was guilty of something, he was a spy, but no one knows what he did except that what he was charged and died for - stealing atomic bomb secrets - he never did.

It would have been nice to learn more, but I think that the film tells us all that we could know.",1363132800,2,1534,4.611721611721611
2064301,4,B00026L9CA,"Regardless of the Rosenbergs' culpability or lack thereof, this is a compelling documentary told from the standpoint of their granddaughter, who grew up hearing the lore but decided to try to figure things out for herself many years after their deaths.  Ivy visits various people who knew her grandparents personally, with the notable exception of Ethel's brother, who sold out his own sister knowing that she would be executed.  Ivy cannot bring herself to speak with him.
  This is not the most professional production, but it is above average in most respects.  It is hard not to be moved by such a tragic story, with two people being executed and leaving behind two sons, distraught parents, anguished siblings and outraged supporters.",1249689600,,739,5.074380165289257
2064302,1,B00026L9CA,"For more than 50 years, defending Julius and Ethel Rosenberg was an article of faith for most committed American leftists. That the couple was framed -- by officials intent on stoking anti-Soviet fervor and embarrassed by counterespionage lapses that allowed Russian moles to infiltrate the government -- was at the core of a worldview of Communism, the Korean War and the ensuing cold war, and an enduring cultural divide stoked by McCarthyism.

Now, that unshakeable faith has been rattled seismically. Not for the first time, of course; in the 1990s, secret Soviet cables released by Washington affirmed the spy ring's existence. But this time, the bedrock under that worldview seemed to transmogrify into clay.

The rattler was Morton Sobell, 91, the case's only living defendant. He admitted in an interview that he and Julius Rosenberg had indeed spied for the Soviet Union. His admission prompted the Rosenbergs' sons, Michael and Robert Meeropol -- self-described magnets for global anguish over their parents' execution in 1953 -- to publicly accept, for the first time, that their father committed espionage. Ronald Radosh, co-author of ""The Rosenberg File,"" a comprehensive account of the trial, declared that ""a pillar of the left-wing culture of grievance has been finally shattered.""

""The Rosenbergs were Soviet spies,"" he said in an op-ed article in The Los Angeles Times, and ""it is time the ranks of the left acknowledge that the United States had (and has) real enemies and that finding and prosecuting them is not evidence of repression.""

For too long leftist stooges, to include many that have reviewed this film have refused to face the obvious facts, that the Rosenbergs were treacherous spies that deserved to die.  Some out of ignorance, others out of blind allegiance to the Soviet killers that threatened the world.  Anyone professing a belief that the Rosenbergs were innocent, after September 2008 (the date of Sobell's confession) is strictly a loony, unworthy of our time.

This film, which attempts to cast doubt on the guilt of these two traitors has been made moot by these revelations.  It is strictly another propaganda piece by ignorant leftists that can not accept that the Rosenbergs were spies and put our country in danger.",1239840000,11,2265,5.15258855585831
2064303,3,B00026L9CA,"I watched the Documentary when it first came out and it was interesting.  However, the Rosenberg's were Soviet spies - Ethel's husband and brother were spies. Her granddaughter, the film maker, opined on the HBO site that Ethel was a spy.  Let passed nuclear weapons info to the Soviet Union. Should they have been executed?  I'm not sure but I don't have much sympathy for them.",1222300800,4,379,4.712121212121212
2064304,4,B00026L9CA,"This year marks the 55th Anniversary of the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg by the American state. As I mentioned in a March 2007 review of a book on their case -they were not our people, but they were our people (meaning they doggedly adhered to the Stalinist line to the end but also upheld the defense of the Soviet Union, as they understood it, as well). Below is a DVD review of a documentary of their lives produced by one of their granddaughters who, although she does not appear to be particularly political, has as many questions about the fate of her grandparents as we militant leftists do.

The first two paragraphs are taken from that previous review to set the stage for the kind of questions that their granddaughter, Ivy Meeropol, daughter of Julius and Ethel's son Robert attempted to deal with on this political case although the thrust of her work was to find out how the case affected her family and their friends as much as anything else.

""Eisenhower, Stalin, the Cold War, the Korean War, atomic bombs, atomic spies, air raid shelters, the ""Red Scare"", McCarthyism and the Rosenbergs- in the mist of time these were early, if undigested terms,  from my childhood. Ah, the Rosenbergs.  That is what I want to write about today. Out of all of those undigested terms that name is the one that still evokes deep emotion in these old bones. For those who have forgotten, or those too young to remember, the controversy surrounding their convictions for espionage in passing information about the atomic bomb to the now defunct Soviet Union and their executions defined an essential part of the 1950's, the hardening of the Cold War period in American history. Their controversial convictions and sentencing evoked widespread protests throughout the world. Thus, those who seek to learn the lessons of history, our working class history, and about justice American-style should take the time to carefully examine the case and come to some conclusions about it....

...And what questions drive the scholarship on the case? Was their trial a frame-up in classic American-style against leftist political opponents of the Cold War and American foreign policy? Were they, individually or collectively, ""master spies"" at the service of the Soviet Union? Were they innocent, if misguided, progressives caught up in the turmoil of the American ""red scare"" of the post-World War II period? Did the government through its FBI and other security agencies, its attorneys, its judges stumble into a case which would make many reputations? Did the American Communist Party, itself under severe scrutiny and persecution, betray the Rosenbergs? Did the various international campaigns on behalf of the couple work at cross purposes with their various demands for a new trial, reduction of sentence and clemency? What kind of people were these Rosenbergs? In short, were the Rosenbergs heroic Soviet spies, martyrs, dupes or innocents? Those are the questions thoughtful readers are confronted with and I will deal with at least some of them in due course in latter commentaries.""

These same questions mentioned above stalk the viewer today after watching this very personal, and at times tearful, take on the case. Clearly the evident adduced argues more forcefully, especially in light of the Verona tapes, that the Rosenbergs did something illegal, although not what they were executed for. As clearly, as well, they were abandoned by friends and family then and it appears unto the nth generation from Ms. Meeropol's frustrated efforts to put the picture of their lives together through some of the relatives. Moreover, the toll on the two Rosenberg (Meeropol) children (and through them their children) makes this at some level something of a life time curse.

Yet here is a picture that I have constructed that seems to me to be a little closer to the truth. I like the picture of Julius leading a march in defense of freedom for labor leader Tom Mooney at City College of New York in the early 1930's.  I like the picture of Ethel singing in Times Square for the benefit of the Spanish Republicans. I will stick with my original take on the fate of the Rosenbergs- they, in their own ways and for their own purposes, were soldiers of the revolution, and didn't complain about it or their fates. Yes, I like that idea. Yes, that is why at the beginning of this piece I could say without hesitation that these were our people, although they were not our people. Watch this and see why and then go out and get some books on the subject.",1220313600,2,4549,4.891050583657588
2064305,5,B00026L9CA,"This touching, powerful documentary re-opens old wounds that have yet to heal, a fifty year old espionage case that still defies reason.

2064306,5,B00026L9CA,"An absolutely GREAT Documentary. The title of my review does not refer to the Rosenberg's actions in Julius's spying for the Soviet Union, But the integrity of the Rosenberg's in not naming names and the way the Rosenbergs two sons have dealt with the tragedy. There are also great interviews with survivors. I remember the name Sobel from the Newspaper Headlines of the day. Ivy Meeropol interviews Sobel along with a Female who was also arrested.
In one of the previous reviews the Cemetery where the Rosenbergs were buried were buried is declared to not want to help in finding the Grave site. I asssume that the reviewer is not a veteran in finding graves. My Father and I had a harder time than Ivy did of finding Josh Gibson's Grave in the Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh.
One thing that I find curious in both the film AND the comments is that no one mentioned that Abe Meeropol (who adopted the Rosenberg boys) wrote the Anti-Lynching anthem ""Strange Fruit"". (No, Billie just sang it. She didn't even understand the lyrics when she first read them.)
I have had tears in my eyes EACH time that I have watched this film. And if the film was on again I would watch it. Great job, Ivy Meeropol!!!",1182211200,4,1201,4.590697674418605
2064307,5,B00026L9CA,"Ivy Meeropol bravely tells a the story of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg not as leftist martyrs or scheming traitors, they are simply, powerfully two human beings caught up in the wars of their time. They are her mythic, unknown grandparents and as she speaks to those who knew them they and their tragedy come alive for us. Especially heartbreaking is how they were in essence abandoned by so many friends and family members.

By way of bias: Like other reviewers here I doubt that Ethel Rosenberg was guilty of espionage. While I believe Julius Rosenberg did engage in espionage I do not believe that his punishment was justified.",1181606400,6,628,4.814814814814815
2064308,4,B00026L9CA,"The execution of the Rosenbergs in 1953 for conspiracy to commit espionage remains controversial to this day.  The Rosenberg's grand-daughter, Ivy Meeropol, has made a tender documentary which traces the family's reaction to having such controversy in its recent history.  She talks to her father and uncle, the Rosenberg's sons who were orphaned by the execution, and to people who knew the Rosenbergs.  It's sad and moving, but also expertly made and relatively even-handed about the guilt or innocence of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.",1169424000,3,535,5.345238095238095
2064309,5,B00026L9CA,"Ivy Meeropol takes us behind the scenes into the lives of the children of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed in the electric chair at Sing Sing prison for treason in June of 1953.  This extraordinary documentary focuses primarily on the impact of this tragic miscarriage of justice on Ivy and her family.  Viewers who expect to learn about the facts of Rosenberg case are advised to look elsewhere; this is Ivy's story primarly, although we do learn enough about Ethel Rosenberg to appreciate that this was a woman of remarkable integrity and courage.  She could easily have saved her life by betraying her friends and family.  She chose death before dishonor.

Ivy's father Michael and her uncle Robert were young children abandoned by their relatives who did not want to be associated with anyone connected with the notorious Rosenberg trial.  Ann and Abel Meeropol adopted the two boys; Michael became a college professor and Robert a lawyer. Both men have spent much of their adult lives attempting to learn the true facts of the case against their parents.

Ivy discovers that Ethel Rosenberg's brother, David Greenglass, by his own admission, gave false testimony against his sister.  In one scene of the film she drives by the home of Greenglass, but decides against interviewing him.  Greenglass has worked hard to disappear from the public view and has, for the most part, been successful.  Ivy is not ready to question Greenglass about his false testimony.  We respect her reticence in this sensitive matter.

Ivy does visit other relatives, some of whom are now ashamed that they did not have the courage to support the innocent children of the Rosenbergs.  Ivy's purpose is to reestablish family ties; accusation and blame are not on her agenda.

The fact that Ivy comes from a loving family helps us to understand her strength as she confronts the bigotry and lies she tries to dispel with openness and truth.  She is supported completely by her father Michael, her mother Ann, and her brother Gregg.

Heir to an Execution is, perhaps, the wrong title for this moving documentary.  This title suggests an unhappy ending for Ivy and nothing could be more mistaken.  Ivy's journey reveals to her that she is the fortunate daughter of a family that has survived misfortune and become stronger, not by disappearing as David Greenglass has attempted to do, but instead by going public and seeking the truth.  We, the viewers, are fortunate that Ivy has decided to share her quest with us.  Highly recommended!",1149984000,11,2528,4.93144208037825

If you choose to watch this, gird yourself immediately for a smirking adult granddaughter's attempt at fame, admiration and sympathy. She will immediately attempt to seize these from you, by, from the get-go, first showing her visit to the cemetery where her grandparents, the Rosenbergs, were buried after they were executed after they were proven guilty of treason. And yes. They were executed by electric chair. That used to happen to people who made ""unfortunate choices"", as I believe her father put it. The person in the office or guard house at the cemetery ""could/would not"" show her their gravesite. The granddaughter quickly turned to the camera, raised her eyebrows, and SMILED, triumphantly. Hmm, do you suppose she already knew that would happen? Soon after, an elderly relative or family friend began, in this piece, to whine about the Great Depression, actually implying that it was some form of Right Wing Conspiracy, and bringing up what she viewed as a need for ""radicalism at the time. Or forever. Whatever.
I often wonder why oft-perturbed-liberals-who-make-documentaries, as much of the Rosenberg family and friends seem delighted to be so described, think they are the only ""radicals"" in the world. In my view, fighting in Europe and parts beyond as a soldier in two World Wars mere recent decades before the Rosenbergs decided to betray and endanger the US is much more, I don't know, ""radical"" and brave.

8023051,4,B00026L9CA,"In this 2001 film documentary Ivy Meeropol combines archival file footage and interviews with the key survivors of the era of her grandparent's, Julius & Ethel Rosenberg, trial and execution for conspiracy to commit espionage.  She takes no position regarding their guilt or innocence.  Hers is a quest to understand her grandparents, their times and their refusal to save their lives by simply naming one or more of their fellow conspirators.
The accumulated evidence of the past 50 years clearly demonstrates that, certainly, Julius was part of a conspiracy conveying  highly useful and vital military secrets to the Soviets during the period 1943 to 1948/9.
The third defendant,  Morton Sobel is interviewed by Meeropol and answers her question ""did he think they were capable of spying"" with a great deal of giggling ""that he had no special knowledge to impart"" and ""her guess is as good as his"".
Sobel is a world class liar.  A few years later he stated that he, Rosenberg, and a third man he would not identify, spent July 4 1948 holiday microfilming thousands of documents pertaining to US aerodynamics and delivery them to Soviet agents at a Long Island Railroad station.  The information included data on high tail air-frames soon to appear over over Korea and sweeping the US temporarily out of the sky.
Ms Meeropol's search for the truth is brilliantly executed and totally enthralling.  Even 50 odd years on, most of the survivors interviewed are not telling the complete truth.  In this sense, the search for the truth about Ethel and Julius Rosenberg; their choice of orphaning their two small sons and their choice of death on the Sabbath Eve when a single name would have saved them, cannot succeed.
The trial itself was completely besmirched by judicial and prosecutorial misconduct.  Their defense, by their attorney Emmanuel Bloch was totally inept.  There are some of us who believe that Bloch, a good communist, deliberately on orders from the Party , stipulated them into the electric chair.
This documentary is superb.  Ms Meeropol is a charming and attractive young lady who has undertaken a heartbreaking  quest with outstanding success.",1377475200,2,2162,5.059154929577465
