8064294,4,B0009OL8CG,"This movie was really like no other that I've seen.  The basic reason being that not only is a young woman a serial killer in this movie, but also the fact that she kills in order to have ""art"" like photographs being a young photographer.  In this film she breaks up with her boyfriend that she's been with for 4 years because she claims that he's a junkie.  When she gets the chance to be part of an art exhibition she is told by her morbid new employer that she should make extreme art like photos.  This was clearly meant as something unusual, as a matter of fact that morbid employer dosen't even try to hide the fact that these photos are supposed to be about deceased people.  But the young photographer, whose movie name I forgot, soon gets other more gruesome ideas about how to obtain these so called extreme artistic photos, when she kills her ex landlord that cheated her out of a months rent money. With this murder starts a killing spree in which the young woman kills different people for the sake of getting these photos.  This is, I guess, what makes that movie rahter captivating, knowing that she ruthlessly kills just in order to get the ""right"" photos for her assignment.  At times the movie is actually scary too, when you don't really know who's going to be the next victim murdered in cold blood.
All in all, its a good movie if you are into these types of movies.  I wouldn't say that its a true horror movie, because there are a lot of thriller scenes in it as well.  So its really a combination of both genres, and rather well done at that.
Like I wrote, I've not seen a movie like this before, the closet thing that I can compare to it would be the movies that Fiona Horsey is usually in.  Meaning those horror like flics, like for example ""Twisted Sisters"", ""Love Sick"" or ""Penetration Angst"".  Where a female killer is viciously killing (in these cases only males) people.  But ""Snapped"" is different in the sense that its got something more sexier to it, although in a very morbid sense, especially when the young woman shots those photos of her killed victims.",1232841600,3,2091,4.459317585301838
