8556091,5,B00AQ5Y1N6,"Made during Hollywood's illustrious 'Golden Age of Cinema', specifically in 1953, this powerful motion picture made it's way to the big-screen and was an Box Office hit! It was so well received by theater-goer's that a sequel was made. That being: DEMETRIUS AND THE GLADIATORS, starring Victor Mature. But this color, single-disc, DVD film classic - THE ROBE, which has a cast of thousands, features the late Actor - Sir Richard Burton in the title role of the Roman Tribune: Marcellus Gallio. Actress Jean Simmons portrays the lovely - Lady Diana and rugged/strongman, Actor - Victor Mature is Demetrius, a Greek Slave who is owned by Tribune Marcellus. This film was so well done, that it was appropriately nominated for 5 Academy Awards, including: Best Picture. This colossal epic depicting all of the pomp and circumstance that was once the mighty Roman Empire..., is set at the time of Christ during the reign of Emperor Tiberius in the year of 33 A.D. Jesus - the Christ, has been crucified. And Tribune Marcellus Gallio - the son of a prominent Roman Senator, was one of the soldiers that crucified Him. And in so doing, some of the Lords' Blood drops got on the Tribune and he started to change. The spoiled-rotten, wealthy, drunken, womanizing, pagan Roman, instantly... without realizing it, deep within his being spiritually clashed, when the Holy, innocent, Divine, life-giving, omnipotent Blood of the sinless, sacrificial Lamb - Jesus the Christ, and His atoning Blood, literally got on the Tribune's hand. The result of which, was that he thought he was losing his mind. And, after having won THE ROBE of Christ while gambling for it at the foot of The Cross, his slave Demetrius after a series of events, takes THE ROBE and joins up with the Apostle Peter and other Christians, and disappears. Tribune Gallio thinks that if he finds THE ROBE, that he will regain his full mental faculties and his recurring nightmares will cease, as well. The Emperor Tiberius at the request of the gracious Lady Diana, who was in love with the Tribune, was given a second chance. By royal decree, he was sent on a seemingly impossible mission to regain his sanity. That being, to find THE ROBE of Christ. In addition, he hopes to recapture his escaped slave, Demetrius. This magnificent, epic motion picture... all 133-minutes of it, is an awesome spectacle to behold. With a screenplay by Albert Maltz - that is based on the novel by Lloyd C. Douglas, is not only a faith-builder but is deeply moving, as well. In spoken English with sub-titles in English and Spanish, this Special Edition of THE ROBE, is truly inspiring. A keeper. Especially for your classic DVD collection. Nina Kish",1436745600,2,2688,4.87117903930131
