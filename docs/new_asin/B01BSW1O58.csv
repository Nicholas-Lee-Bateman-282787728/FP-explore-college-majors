7666755,5,B01BSW1O58,Really enjoyed Forgotten Tales. It goes to show that not every movie needs to be a mega mainstream film to be good. It's definitly worth checking out.,1465257600,,150,4.592592592592593

7666757,5,B01BSW1O58,"A Good Gory Fun Fright Flick!

Reyna Young's ""Forgotten Tales"" is a clever horror anthology film, based on her comic book series of the same name. There are three stories, ""Ghost Story"", ""The Babysitter"" and ""Audition"", and each has their own creepy, singular vibe. Each story ends with the final shot fading into an EC Comics-style illustration, which is reminiscent of the paintings in  Rod Serling's ""Night Gallery"" and, of course, Creepshow.

There's a good mix of the horrific and the humorous. What was the most clever part of the film is that, although each story is in themselves a complete narrative, the characters of each part of the trilogy interact with each other, like Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts"" and Michael Dougherty's ""Trick R' Treat."" But, the characters aren't just making appearances in another character's story, they are widening the narrative to show that all of the stories are connected (take a look at the police bulletin boards ""Wanted"" and ""Missing"" photos).

My favorite episode is ""The Babysitter"", which twists expectations and has the best reveal in its final shot. Standout performances from Kelsey Zukowski, Connie Jo Sechrist, and Wyzae Crankfield (who, I think is a musician-and this is his first acting role).

At 70 minutes the movie flies by thanks to plenty of story to go around and decent pacing.

Enjoyable, and worth a look or two- to catch the intersections of story toy might have missed the first time!",1465084800,,1451,5.0

The blatant music band advertising is cool in a way, but hilariously over the top. A couple of the actresses are fetish models and they are really beautiful, but stuff they do and how things turn out don't make much sense.",1466208000,,365,4.462686567164179

7666773,1,B01BSW1O58,"First the good: We liked the heart shaped nipples on the one girl.

The rest: I think this movie is supposed to be about female empowerment. A noble subject, but not executed well. The women were good because they were women, and the men in the movie were bad because they were men. We were never given a reason to care about the women. What were we shown about the women to make us empathize with them?

We find out the first girl likes to eat salad and cheese, and has several beverages throughout the opening 10 minutes of the picture. We were unsure of her name, so we called this character 'Dina the Drinker,' because her only consistent act was to drink liquids and talk on the phone (we didn't find out her name until 10-15 minutes in). Her assailant's motive for attack is... reasons? He just likes to kill girls. Unfortunately, a recurring theme.

The second tale starts with the aforementioned 'heart-shaped nipples' girl. This could be a good look for me. I genuinely liked the way they look. Then, we get to the story: A woman is going to babysit. That's about it. She shows up, naps, gets creeped out and then the man that hired her tries to kill her. Again, for reasons unknown. At least this killer has a touch of personality, though again, no motivation.

The third story was the only part of the movie with a semblance of a plot: A director is obsessed with an actress for some reason. I hate to keep saying 'some reason,' but there's no way around it. The reason anything happens in this movie is just because it does. So this girl is kidnapped by the director and is killed. The end.

And then we get to the credits, some of which seem to be missing the top half of the letters. And Reyna Young congratulates herself by putting her name all over the credits.

All in all, not good. Story and structure can help any low-budget movie, from Paranormal Activity to Thankskilling (a goofy, terrible, but memorable movie).",1466208000,3,1935,4.482954545454546
