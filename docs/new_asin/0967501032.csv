Next, these ""Christian"" guys show footage of the men trampling what is deemed ""holy ground"", busting ancient rocks, and use photographs found on the web. They even mention how they lied, deceived and yet never tell the viewers how they actually found out about this. They are not the first and it is well documented especially in the US. Please search Ron Wyatt.  They are not even second or third. If they were actually even in Saudia Arabia their god would have struck them with lightning. Bottomline if you are seeking the person accredited with the discovery it is Ron Wyatt and his family. The footage is raw but you can find it on the web, his tribute page, or Youtube. Ron Wyatt and his sons were even jailed for it in Saudia Arabia.

As well, Nweiba Beach STILL has the God provided land bridge that was made FULLY DRY during the night (Ex. 14:21-22), for the Hebrews to walk across. Not a tidal shift, the wind blew!

This was as good of a biblical archaeology based documentary that I've seen to date, that used the bibles words and details to find Mt. Sinai. Unlike many archaeology sites that do not fit all of the biblical account and details, this one did down to types of tree's and water springs - amazing!. As far as these men, going onto land that was marked ""no trespass"". That is a political issue for certain, however, these men did not upturn, disrupt, destroy or hurt any land nor did they take anything from the land, nor did they vandalize structures, most of the entrance on foot which caused little disruption. They simply took video and photos. As far as the quality of the documentary;it was well done, easy to follow and simply laid out. I wish that other biblical based, archaeology type documentaries were done so simply. This area follows all the details the bible lays out about Mt. Sinai and one can hardly argue that it seems to fit in every detail. We may never be able to verify for certain, but I'm not sure it's necessary. This shows us that something went on in this area, in ancient days that seemed to fit the history of the bible, regarding the Hebrews as the bible says it did.",1493510400,3,1265,4.504347826086956

One of them is supposedly a police officer, but what kind of police officer admits to committing crimes in the search for historical truth? And the other one says he'll gladly accept the consequences for ""the risks they took"" - but apparently he doesn't mean the crimes they committed in Saudia Arabia because obviously he didn't turn himself in to the Saudi authorities to face any consequences.

I do however have some reservations.
1) I am not sure but it appears that they have forged documents to get into Saudi Arabia, which is questionable conduct.
2) They jumped fences at night (breaking local law) to get to the Mt. Sinai, again questionable conduct.
3) They claim Israelite walked through shallow naturally formed ""bridges"" at the Red sea. Although plausible, it appears to be different from bible which states that walls of water were formed.  No archaeological evidences were provided for their claim unlike other&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exodus-Revealed-Searching-for-the-Red-Sea-Crossing/dp/B00005AUE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exodus Revealed: Searching for the Red Sea Crossing</a>&nbsp;where the site of Nuweibaa backed up by Biblical accounts and archaeological evidences.

173282,1,0967501032,"I wish I could give this video a high rating... I would love to say it is inspirational and educational... because it FEELS that way when you are watching it.  But the problem is that the story presented in the video IS NOT ACCURATE.  In fact, the more you research on the subject, the more you discover that Bob Cornuke, one of the 'adventurers' who supposedly found the 'real' Mt. Sinai, is not telling the truth.

This man makes a habit of claiming he's found amazing things (Noah's Ark! The anchor from Paul's shipwrecked boat! The real Mt. Sinai!) and then when Christian scientists (archeologists, geologists, etc.) take a look at his evidence, they shake their heads and list all the reasons he's wrong.

He brags about lying to the Saudi Arabian government in order to get a visa into the country, and the truth is that he is lying to us as well.  Even though he knows his theories have been disproven, he still sells them around because he makes money by selling his books & movies.  He claims to be a Christian, but I'm pretty sure we are called to ""speak the truth in love"" and not ""make stuff up because we wish it were so.""

Gordon Franz has spent the most time documenting Cornuke's inaccuracies (see http://www.lifeandland.org/2012/06/how-accurate-are-bob-cornuke%E2%80%99s-claims-2/ ) but there are a number of other Christian scholar out there who have also taken the time to identify facts that Cornuke has omitted or distorted in order to make his claims.

If you are interested in a fiction video, this could be an interesting ""what if"" sort of film.

One was on the beach on the Sinai penensula and the other on the beach opposite in Saudi Arabia (Midian).  Also, he had photographed some coral covered chariot parts on the bottom of the Red Sea at the crossing sight.",1395187200,,542,4.723404255319149
173291,5,0967501032,"This is a wonderful movie that actually shows the REAL MT. SINAI that matches with the descriptions of the Bible. It is NOT in the Egyptian Peninsula, it's not in current Israel.  Scripture over and over says that Mt. Sinai is in the land of Midian, it is ""out  of Egypt"" and according to the Bible in Galatians 4:25, even says that Mt. SInai is in Arabia.

Yes, the real Mt. Sinai is in Saudi Arabia where is it known as Jabal Musu, Jabal al-Lawz, or Moses' Mountain.  This is where Moses tended the flocks of Jethro his father-in-law, in the land of MIdian which is NOT in the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula but in the land of current Saudi Arabia, east of the Gulf of Aquba.  In the Bible, see Exodus 2:15-16, 22; 3:1,10-12; 4:18-21.  Even Elijah went here in
1 Kings 19:8 and stayed in the cave on the mountain (Mt. Horeb- see Exodus 3:1) when he was ""running"" from Queen Jezebel.

This video shows the burnt black top of the mountain, an altar site at the base, the split rock where the water gushed out to
water the children of Israel, the twelve springs of Elim along with the 70 palms, etc.  There is no other site on earth that fits all
of the descriptions of the Bible and you can see it with your own eyes.  (Ever wonder why in the maps in your Bible that there are
question marks for some of the locations of the flight from Egypt?  Its because they were looking in the wrong places!)

This was first found by Ron Wyatt while he was searching for Mt. Sinai, and he made the map that the men on this video followed to
find it and record the proof.  Another video that is as equally important and should be purchased is called ""The Exodus Revealed.""
Shows more photos and even goes into searching for the Red Sea Crossing - very impressive.",1394582400,9,1744,4.299694189602446

173299,5,0967501032,"This is a DVD that I have shown many times at my jail ministry. It never fails to astound even the more skeptical. Christian apologetics is an area within Christian teaching that is woefully under taught, in my opinion. This is a film that will, at the very least, encourage your faith in the One, Almighty God and the authenticity of His Word. Although not a digitally enhanced, sensationalized video, the creators did a good job of catching and keeping your attention.

The video hits on a number of scriptural passages describing the journey to, and the camping at The Real Mount Sinai. Here are a few of the highlight  you will enjoy when watching:

1) They mention that the bible states that the phrase, ""Out of Egypt"" is mentioned 72 times to describe where the Israelites were to go. This means that it could NOT be in the Sinai peninsula.
2) Pictures of the Biter Springs of Marah (Exodus 15:23)
3) Pictures of where the 12 springs of Elim were probably located (Exodus 15:27)
4) There is a picture of what the locals call, ""The caves of Moses"" where the explorers were told by a Syrian archeologist at the site, excavations have shown numerous pieces of evidence that Moses traveled through the area.
5) The local Bedouins call this particular mountain, ""The Mountain of Moses""
6) They show video and pictures of a huge alter at the base of the mountain covered with petroglyphs of bovine (cattle) that are not indigenousness to the area.
7) They show numerous alter sites, markers, and other remains scattered around the mountain.
8) You will see the split rock at Horeb where water gushed forth, and
9) The rocks around it that are completely warn down like river rocks in an area that only gets 1/4"" rain every 10 years!
10) Pictures of a huge basin that could easily become a lake and store millions of gallons of water
11) There is a large cave
12) Most interesting to me was that the entire top of the mountain is BLACK!
13) They take a rock at the top of the mountain, break it open, and see that it is completely charred on the outside, but perfect granite on the inside - - meaning that it wasn't just volcanic, black rock.
14)  They show an area that could have been used as a battlefield.
15) They find groves of Acasia wood that could have been used to build the Ark of the Covenant
16) They find a burnt patch of rocks (like at the summit) at the split rock of Horeb

The one area that I disagree with is where the crossing took place. Other research into where the crossing actually took place has led me to conclude that it was much further north than this video claims.

As I've dug further into this, I have found numerous sites on the internet with pictures and even video which confirms everything that they showcase in the DVD. In fact, something that astounded me that I ran across is that if you go to Google Maps and look for the mountain (simply type the GPS coordinates like this, ""28 35.60, 35 22.75"" into "" maps dot google dot com"") you will see that the mountain is COMPLETELY BLURRED OUT! That's right! The surrounding desert area is crystal clear, but the area around the mountain cannot be resolved. What does that say?!

After viewing this DVD and other information from Ron Wyatt and the Caldwells, I see no reason why this threshold hasn't been met that it can be stated without question the true location of Exodus has been discovered.  Not only that but this is a true witness to the fact God exists!  The Saudi's should be shaking in their boots after recovering this site proving God's supernatural feats as stated in Exodus.

173324,4,0967501032,"The original DVD acknowledged the family who were able to bring out film and photos of this area. This DVD has wiped away all those people who had been apart to this discovery. There are a couple added pieces of information about this find not in the original DVD, but I missed the photos that showed the outlines of the feet of the people of Israel who had ""claimed"" this land as their own in the first DVD. Where ever the soles of their feet touched, that would be their land.

These two men have the resources and connections to make themselves appear to have made this discovery on their own, but in reality there are a few more people who discovered this site before them, yet lacked the means to go public with it. And it was their information and documentation that ended up the hands of Bob Cornuke and Larry Williams. I would have more respect for these men if they had been truthful about all the people and documentation they used for their discovery.

Sad to say that the original DVD costs about $175 through Amazon (why?), and I can't find it anywhere else. You can, however,see it for free on other websites, and I would recommend it.

173336,5,0967501032,"It doesn't matter who was the ""first"" to discover Mt. Sinai, that isn't the point of the film.  The thrill lies in the Mt. itself and the place of encampment in the dessert below.  To see evidence still standing thousands of years later is both mind-boggling and awe inspiring.  I am so grateful to these men for putting their findings onto film for the rest of us to enjoy and share in their thrill; to feel the same breathlessness they did upon their discovery.  As it turns out a family who lived in the area had already found the site, like these men, on their own and were able to explore even more of the mountain, Elijah's cave and  the surrounding area.  When the makers of this film learned of the family they quickly contacted them and include the family's film, pictures and findings as well.  Over the years there have been skeptics disclaiming the story of Moses and other Bible leaders as ""fairy tales"".  But this stands alone for all the doubters and believers alike to see.  The only thing I challenge is the actual route taken through the sea itself.  Though I believe it is definitely that area, I'm not ready to agree they traveled on a ""reef"".  But that is of no consequence.  The dvd is a must-see for all people, even agnostics.  If a thrill doesn't run through your core, you must be dead.",1274486400,,1312,4.46218487394958

I tend to be skeptical when it comes to claims like these, but nonetheless it's amazing to think it might be legit. Some of the evidence is a bit of a stretch, and some is pretty circumstantial, but there seems to be some strong evidence too, and when it is all put together into one package, it's enough to convince me this may well be the real Mt. Sinai.

If you're interested in this, you might want to check out Ron Wyatt's version as well. Google for ""Wyatt Museum"". I'm VERY skeptical of Ron, but their production on this same topic makes for even better viewing with tighter scriptual references, and they also branch out into other interesting supposed biblical finds.

Overall, I recommend Wyatt's take over this one, but both are worth a watch whether you are Christian or not. Especially recommended to anyone of the Abrahamic faiths.",1234742400,2,1080,4.673684210526316

173357,5,0967501032,"This is one of the most incredible DVDs that I have ever bought in my entire life. I was amazed by the journey of two men. One is a christian and the other is not a christian. As a believer myself I already believe and know that the bible is inspired by God (2 Timothy 3:16).  As the two men documented their journey I was excited by each new discovery. I've shown this video to 3 Christians so far and they were encouraged by the detail and accuracy take from scripture. For someone what is skeptical I would recommend that they would purchase this DVD with an open mind. The whole point of Mt. Sinai is where Moses received the 10 commandments fo Gods law. The first four commandments represent loving God with all our heart, soul mind and strength and the last 6 commandments represent loving our neighbors as ourselves.  Ofcourse today when we examine ourselves by looking at the 10 commandments we discover that we are guilty of breaking them. Who hasn't told a lie? In Revelations 21:8 we are told that all liars will have their part in the lake of fire. The 10 commandments cannot save us. It is just a mirror to show us that we are seperated by God because of sin. Because God is Holy, Righteous and Just, He must punish sin with eternal punishment in a place called hell. But God did something incredible for those who repent & believe in Jesus Christ because Jesus came to earth and lived a sinless life and then died on the cross for our sins, paying the penalty that all of us deserve. Are you broken over your sin? Are you shattered over your sinfulness? Jesus said, ""Blessed is the poor in Spirit""  After Jesus died, He rose from the grave, defeating death. You can sum it up like this. We broke the law but Jesus paid the fine. Jesus said, ""Unless you repent, you will perish"" This is God-given (John 6:44) Repent & believe and then get baptized as a sign of obedience toward God and the read your bible and obey the Lord & Master of your life, Jesus Christ.

173381,3,0967501032,"The DVD titled ""The Search for the Real Mt. Sinai"" is not the original discovery though whatever shown in it is authentic. The site was first discovered by amateur biblical archeologist Mr. Ron Wyatt who is also credited with the discovery of Noah's Ark. It was he who first entered Saudi Arabia along with his two sons without proper papers and went on to discover the site. However, he and his sons were soon arrested by the Saudi authorities on the charges of espionage for the state of Israel. They were later released by the authorities after three months when Ron Waytt was able to convince the Saudi authorities that he had found the real ""Mount Sinai"". However, the evidence they had collected was confiscated by the authorities. After the incident, the Saudi authorities converted the entire area into an archeological site and fenced the whole area fearing that the site might lead to political instability as it would attract attention from Christians and Jewish people which they probably deemed undesirable for a Muslim state. However, after some years, Ron did manage to get the videos of Mt. Sinai and its surroundings with the help of a friend. It is only after this that the biblical explorers Bob Cornuke and Larry Williams visited the site and brought the evidence. If you notice in this DVD, the archeologists Bob and Larry state that some persons had gone in Saudi before and got arrested with their videos confiscated. They were talking about Ron.

If you really want to have more in-depth information about Mount Sinai, I strongly recommend that you go to the website of Wyatt Museum (just search it on any search engine like yahoo or google. Not being able to mention it due to restrictions) to get the original and more authentic footage (without any recreations as in this DVD) and see for yourself. The evidence presented on ""The Exodus"" DVD available on the said site is much vast and the onsite footage much detailed. It explores the events & route of the Exodus, revealing the extensive amount of evidence which proves the precise accuracy of the Biblical account in thrilling detail. Featuring the Red Sea Crossing site and Mt. Sinai in Saudi Arabia, it presents compelling evidences like the altar ""Jehovah Nissi"" made by Moses near the Rock at Horeb; the infamous Golden Calf altar; the remains of 12 Marble Pillars erected by Moses for the twelve tribes of Israel as recorded in the Scriptures; a Solitary tree located at the peak of Mt. Sinai; the water-providing large Rock at Horeb; the area of the Holy Precinct and Phoenician-style granite column erected later by King Solomon to commemorate the great event of Exodus. It also explores the underwater evidence such as Egyptian chariot remains, found at the red sea crossing site. The ""Search for the Real Mt. Sinai"" DVD supplements little information when compared to ""The Exodus"" DVD. However, as always is the case, the original things generally get subdued by their duplicates.

Not only this, the above site also contains DVDs on discoveries of Noah's Ark, Exodus, Sodom & Gomorrah and Ark of the Covenant. After viewing these DVDs, I really believe that the God had chosen Ron Wyatt to unearth all the major discoveries to be a witness for this last adulterous generation, as all the discoveries made by Mr. Ron Wyatt are incredible and possible only with the understanding given by the LORD. I feel priviledged and blessed to have witnessed the proof of God's mighty work in the past and also invite you to share the evidence put forth by God.",1173484800,103,3538,4.836633663366337
173382,3,0967501032,"This was pretty interesting but I felt it was also a bit superficial and amaturish.

OK: The site commonly believed to be Mount Sinai does not jive with the description in the Bible. Among other things, it has no cave, no evidence of springs, etc. etc. So far I'm with them.

So we look for an alternate site. The two ""hosts"" of the video mention that there are several other places that have been suggested as alternate sites for Mount Sinai. We are never told what these alternatives are or why they are believed to be the location. Instead we go straight to a location in Saudi Arabia.

Now, Saudi Arabia is not an easy country to get into unless you are on a Hajj or a guest worker. So, these guys forge a letter with Saudi governmental letterhead and a copied signature of the king. Not a real smart idea and, I'm pretty sure, illegal.

Anyhow, these two guys find everything they expect to find at the Mountain of Moses. They also find petroglyphs of ""Egyptian"" cattle not indiginous to the region. Unfortunately the petroglyphs are not carved in Egyptian style and appear to predate the Egyptian period.

These guys are convinced that the Saudi government is trying to hide the fact that this mountain is Sinai because there is a fence around it marked by the Ministry of Antiquities. Well, this location clearly has some archeological value and they probably don't want people wandering around it and damaging it... such as our two Indiana Jones types do, climbing to the peak and smashing open a rock.

The two also claim to see an ancient battlefield near the base of the mountain (but we are not shown it on video. What obvious evidence would there be of a bronze-era battlefield after 3,000 years?).

All that aside, the idea that the Saudis would try to hide the mountain for religious reasons is proposterous. Moses is considered an Islamic prophet and such a site would be a source of pride for them.

If these two had ever attempted to get in touch with the Ministry of Antiquities they would probably tell them what evidence they have found there.

All the aside, the film relies a lot on reconstructions of events and a handful of experts speaking on-camera. I liked the narration immensely, done by Mr. John Rhys-Davies I believe. He played Salah in all those Indiana Jones movies.",1168214400,12,2300,4.631449631449631
173383,5,0967501032,"Other reviewers have stated the essence of why this is a classic DVD, and so I will not repeat what most of them have basically concluded.

  When I saw this, I couldn't help but be grimly amused by the lack of coverage this information has received by the mainstream news outlets, which, while proclaiming their objectivity, filter out data that would make both them and many of their readers highly uncomfortable. This in itself speaks volumes.

  I have purchased and given several of these DVD's to friends.

As to the veracity of the clams of Bob and Larry, ask yourself this.

  Why would Saudi Arabia create a military base and fence off the area?

They're not stupid.  If they ever decided to launch an attack against Israel, what better place to fire missles from?  The Israelis would think twice before trying to take out this installation with a massive missle counter-attack because in so doing, they would risk destroying such a revered site.

  It would be interesting to know if any global satellite pictures showing the scorched peak in this region have been taken and are available to the public via the internet.  If so, a skeptic could get visual evidence for himself.",1163721600,3,1187,4.768472906403941
173384,5,0967501032,"This DVD is absolutely incredible. It is the documentation (with footage and photos) of the real Mt. Sinai within Saudi Arabia. This is the real thing, not some bogus claims. The two men featured in the DVD retraced the Exodus according to the Biblical criteria, found the Red Sea crossing point, and eventually snuck into Saudi Arabia. They continued on their journey and came to what the locals call the Mountain of Moses where they found (and filmed) the acutal altar the children of Israel constructed to worship the golden calf (with Eyptian drawings of the calf on the altar), the rock that split and evidence of there having been a large reservoir of water flowing from it (in an area that gets 1/2 inch of rain every ten years), the boundary markers Moses had set up, the remnant of the altar, and even a scorched top on the mountain!

To add ""truth is stranger than fiction"" suspense, the area is fenced off and lightly guarded by the Saudi government (the political ramifications of Moses and the Israelites having been in Saudi Arabia at one time is a red hot issue).

This material is an excellent source to document the Exodus and Numbers accounts. Its apologetical value is yet to be appreciated. You simply must get this one!",1159142400,28,1240,4.68348623853211

173386,3,0967501032,"Many years ago Ron Wyatt, an intrepid explorer, claimed to have found the real Mount Sinai, becoming one of many men to have made this claim. But this was only one of his many claims. He also claimed to have found Noah's Ark, chariot wheels from the Red Sea, The Ark of the Covenant, the ruins of Sodom and Gomorrah, and even the hole into which Jesus' cross was placed. While Wyatt has largely been exposed as a fraud, some people continue to believe that he did find clues leading to the location of the mountain on which God gave His Law to Moses.

Enter two American adventurers. Several years ago Bob Cornuke, a former police officer and Larry Williams, a commodities trader, embarked on an adventure to find the real Mount Sinai. Borrowing from Wyatt's data, and moving forward on three assumptions, they determined that a likely site for the mountain was Midian - now a part of Saudi Arabia. Their assumptions were as follows. First, that the Sinai Peninsula was considered part of the ""Land of Egypt"" and hence could not have been the location of Mt. Sinai, for the Bible clearly states that the Israelites went ""out of Egypt;"" second, that Mt. Sinai is in the Land of Midian; third, that according to Galatians 4:25, Mt. Sinai is in Saudi Arabia (""Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia""), which assumes that the Arabia of our day is the same as in Paul's day. Many scholars would take issue with each of these assumptions.

With falsified documents Cornuke and Williams entered the Saudi Kingdom and began their search. The Search for the Real Mt. Sinai is a documentary on DVD that details their search. It contains both original footage recorded on their journey and dramatic recreations. What they found, if true, represents the greatest archaelogical discovery since the Dead Sea Scrolls. They claim to have found the well at Marah; the twelve springs of Elim; the caves of Moses and Jethro; the altar for the golden calf; the altar of Moses; the twelve pillars representing the twelve tribes of Israel; the blackened rock from when God came upon the mountain in fire; and the split rock of Horeb from which water flowed. They claim to have found nearly irrefutible evidence of the real Mount Sinai.

The explorers believe that this is common knowledge in that part of the world, for they found that the mountain they identified as the probable Mt. Sinai is surrounded by a fence and heavily guarded by Saudi troops. Like something out of a script for Indiana Jones, they crawled past this fence in the dead of night, finding their way with night vision goggles to avoid detection. Finally they scaled the mountain and found these amazing discoveries.

In short, this DVD presents a very convincing case that these men truly did find the real Mount Sinai. But as always, there are two sides of the story. While it is easy to convince ignorant laypeople like myself, experts have raised serious questions about the validities of these claims. And like most biblical issues, nobody can be neutral as every person has something to lose and something to gain.

The DVD is fascinating and informative, though unfortunately there is far more recreated footage than original photos and video. The production is very good throughout - about equal to the level of quality we would expect to see on The Learning Channel or Discovery.

As I wrote earlier in this review, if all that these men have found is accurate, they have made a discovery of incredible importance. Watching the DVD it is difficult to be swayed by their excitement and determination. Their adventure makes for a great story. But when reality sets in, it seems that there are many difficult questions that remain unanswered. If you are able to suspend your reason just a little bit, you'll enjoy this presentation and be swept away in the possibility that you might be seeing the very sites described in the Bible. But when the credits roll, you'll be forced to remember that we walk by faith, not by sight. Whether or not this is the biblical site matters little to our faith. If we allow our faith to be shaped by such discoveries, we will have little depth and will be easily swayed. It is ""An evil and adulterous generation [that] seeks for a sign."" But we can all enjoy a good story, even if it is just a little bit too good to be true.",1119744000,18,4310,4.67193675889328
173387,3,0967501032,"The DVD titled ""The Search for the Real Mt. Sinai"" is not the original discovery though whatever shown in it is authentic. The site was first discovered by amateur biblical archeologist Mr. Ron Wyatt who is also credited with the discovery of Noah's Ark. It was he who first entered Saudi Arabia along with his two sons without proper papers and went on to discover the site. However, he and his sons were soon arrested by the Saudi authorities on the charges of espionage for the state of Israel. They were later released by the authorities after three months when Ron Waytt was able to convince the Saudi authorities that he had found the real ""Mount Sinai"". However, the evidence they had collected was confiscated by the authorities. After the incident, the Saudi authorities converted the entire area into an archeological site and fenced the whole area fearing that the site might lead to political instability as it would attract attention from Christians and Jewish people which they probably deemed undesirable for a Muslim state. However, after some years, Ron did manage to get the videos of Mt. Sinai and its surroundings with the help of a friend. It is only after this that the biblical explorers Bob Cornuke and Larry Williams visited the site and brought the evidence. If you notice in this DVD, the archeologists Bob and Larry state that some persons had gone in Saudi before and got arrested with their videos confiscated. They were talking about Ron.

If you really want to have an in-depth information of the site, I strongly recommend that you go to [...] to get the original and more authentic footage (without any recreations as in this DVD) and see for yourself. The evidence available on ""The Exodus"" DVD available at [...] is much vast and the onsite footage much detailed. The ""Search for the Real Mt. Sinai"" DVD supplements little information when compared to ""The Exodus"" DVD. However, as always is the case, the original things generally get subdued by their duplicates.

173388,3,0967501032,"I just bought this movie, and I must say that it doesn't give compelling evidence for the real Mt. Sinai. I will give it three stars because it is interesting. One of the problems I found with the film is that the characters seamed to contradict themselves, and if you pay attention you will notice that they gave very little footage of they're findings. Sadly, I don't know of any films that deal with archeology that could replace this one, only some excellent books like ""evidence that demands a verdict"" that I think do give conclusive evidence for the historicity of the BIBLE by Josh McDowell, books from Norman Geisler, F.F.
