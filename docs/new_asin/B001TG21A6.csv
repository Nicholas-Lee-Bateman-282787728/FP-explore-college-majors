8534988,5,B001TG21A6,"I've '' ALWAYS'' enjoyed listening to The Kingsmen Quartet perform;  whether I saw them in person, or just listened to them by way of vinyl LP or VHS.  I've been looking for this 1 LIVE concert video for the longest time;  e-bay had it priced at $ 49.99 which I honestly thought was way too expensive  so, I ordered it from amazon.com  at a much cheaper and reasonable price. Including this video, I now have about 5 Kingsmen LIVE videos;  and I enjoy listening to each and every one!!",1383523200,,485,4.393258426966292
