8492424,3,B006490R1I,"In 2008 we saw ""Mesrine: Public Enemy No. 1,"" a bio-pic about Jacques Mesrine, the most wanted man in France. This is followed by ""Public Enemies"" starring Johnny Depp as John Dillinger. Now from Brazil arrives another biographical film ""Boca,"" which chronicles the rise and fall of a real-life gangster Hiroito de Moraes Joanides (played by Daniel de Oliveira), in the underworld of Boca do Lixo, a downtown area of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

The Brazilian period gangster movie is based on the autobiography of Hiroito himself, who had been drawn into the criminal world by the late 1950s. Those who expect the detailed accounts of his activities, however, may be disappointed because the film is reticent about some of the shocking events that happened in his life - the murder of his father, for instance.

Also, ""Boca"" does not contain gun action scenes like intense shoot-outs in ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and Brian De Palma-directed ""Scarface."" With the matter-of-fact descriptions of the family life and crimes of our anti-hero, some of which are violent, the film favors realism over artistic style. The result is not bad, though with little insight into what drives Hiroito, the film's episodic narrative sometimes seems uneven and disjointed, leaping from one scene to another without fully developing his character.

Don't expect a fast-paced, tightly-knit narrative of ""City of God."" Flawed as it is, ""Boca"" is watchable, thanks to the excellent performance from Daniel de Oliveira, and the sharp photography of Adrian Teijido.",1349481600,2,1526,5.195121951219512
