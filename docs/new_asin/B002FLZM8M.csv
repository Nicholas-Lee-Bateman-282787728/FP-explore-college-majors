3921945,5,B002FLZM8M,"A guy with higher standards isn't that refreshing! Not that he didn't have problems, but he took them to the Lord and saw a bigger picture. Like when he was angry with Mark, he was challenged to lash out but didn't. The trusting faith he had in Meagan was great  because she was led by her feelings and emotions. When she realized what she had done to herself and her witness for Christ she had a great guy to come back to. The Bible says do what is right and Chris did!",1341619200,33,470,4.108695652173913
3921946,3,B002FLZM8M,"I think the movie producers should've spent more resources on dialog and content and less on locations.  The story is good but it lacked in quality writing.  Though, I appreciate the effort very much.",1335312000,3,200,4.852941176470588
3921947,5,B002FLZM8M,"This is a great movie! It's not just a chick flick, it has a lot of depth in both the message of the movie and also with respect to character development and plot. I wish more movies were like this...it's not a shallow film with a pointless message like so many movies out there, like the new movie with Justin Timberlake called Friends with Benefits, how trashy, yet this is what we think of when we think of good movies?...sad. This should show our culture that films don't have to have crude language and sexual innuendos in order to be entertaining. If you think of some of the best movies of our generation the common theme to them all is more often than not nobility and uprightness (think Gladiator) not crudeness and vulgarity. I hope more films come out just like this one that hold to a higher standard. It is sad to see the height in which our nation has fallen, films are getting worse and worse...but not this one.

Thanks for putting this film on Amazon.",1328313600,143,968,4.438202247191011
3921948,3,B002FLZM8M,The movie was okay in the acting category but I liked the story.  It had the usual two guys competing over the same girl.  One guy was just using her while the other truly wanted a long term relationship with her.  In the end the right guy ends with her but not without alot of moments of rejection and disappointment.,1305676800,7,318,4.266666666666667
3921951,5,B002FLZM8M,Nice. There is a moral to this story.,1502064000,,37,3.75
3921952,1,B002FLZM8M,"Yikes!  The acting was so bad.  You had to think the director just didn't know how to make them feel comfortable, or something.  The storyline wasn't terrible, except a little to churchy for me.  Always room for God in a movie, just don't need it every five minutes.",1495756800,,266,4.479166666666667
3921953,1,B002FLZM8M,"The acting was not good. The dialogue was worse. The music was corny. How did this movie get a four star rating? And how was it allowed to have a summary that misled the viewer into not realizing it was a Christian movie. I felt fooled, like listening to Christian music in 80s. God would not approve of this deception.",1493078400,,319,4.333333333333333
3921954,1,B002FLZM8M,"I watched the movie a few years back and started watching the preview to make sure it was the same movie I thought it was. I can't even get through the preview now, the movie was that bad...

This is what a faith based movie looks like when written by somebody that doesn't truly understand the subject matter then made by a producer with a low budget that can't afford a decent director let alone actors.",1491782400,,405,4.328947368421052
3921955,4,B002FLZM8M,"I liked this a lot. The acting is not bad and neither is the writing. I was skeptical of watching this because i am not a religious person and it has a religious theme that i didn't want to deal with. BUT, it is very much underlying the main plot. I felt like this was much more of a love triangle movie than a religious or survival movie, so don't let that turn you off if that's the case. i liked all 3 characters for different reasons. Typical of a tv movie and surprisingly not cheesy, though it does have some cliche moments. similar to blue lagoon (both the tv version and original).",1491696000,2,589,4.221238938053097

3921958,5,B002FLZM8M,I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie. The acting was good for the main three. The real standout was the guy who plays Chris. The scene where is cries to God on the beach had me choking back tears. Good message about trying to fit in with the party crowd and getting burned by your so called friends.,1487203200,,308,4.237288135593221

3921979,1,B002FLZM8M,"I'm sure the movie probably has an uplifting and good spiritual message, but my husband and I didn't finish the movie, because we weren't in the mood for the mediocre acting, poor scripting, and not great production quality that perhaps amplified the limitations of the script and acting. Such things are why Christian films often fail to capture an audience beyond those that are already Christians and generally ready to forgive the sub-quality of many Christian movies. That said, my husband and I may revisit the movie at another time when we are less tired and in less need of a better made movie that doesn't require work to overlook the movie's deficits in order to get into the story.",1485388800,2,692,4.775

3922028,4,B002FLZM8M,"The message of this film is a good one that more people [especially girls] should pay closer attention to. The price for compromise is never ever cheap!  We pay for it often the rest of our lives and ultimately in eternity for those who never repent.
True, some of the acting seemed scripted and unnatural, but it's more forgivable than the trash we see nowadays. I'd rather watch a lower theatrical quality film than a lower moral quality one, if I have to choose!
The reality though, is many girls do not have a ""Chris"" to run back to when they realize they've made a wrong choice. If that is you, I pray that you too, will have the courage and trust in God to do the right thing anyway. He will NEVER, NEVER abandon those who trust him! You may need to wait a long while, but honey, it's sooo worth it! You don't have to have a man in your life, but Jesus you can't live without!!! Get to know him, get involved in a good church with other like minded people. Do something to fill the void besides sitting home! Yes, there is hypocrisy, but ask God to show you who is for real. He really really will do that, and you may be shocked!:o",1480982400,2,1137,4.215596330275229

I love Christian/ Faith movies & because, as a rule these types of movies don't usually get all the $$$ Backing like the BIG Hollywood film makers / producers do, I usually go easy on them.. cuz I understand they don't have the mega bucks and I can overlook a lot...  but this movie was truly really bad, bad production & acting that could not be overlooked. I tried looking past a lot of things, but honestly couldn't get more than 10-15 minutes into watching it before I had to bail... I just hate rating any movie 1-star, but it truly was that bad folks, sorry...",1478044800,4,595,4.3125

As a Christian, it is wonderful and refreshing to have a wholesome movie to watch. As an actress, it is completely disconcerting to watch a wholesome movie with cheesy acting, a completely unbelievable storyline and a horrible score. Thankfully I was only half-watching as I had this movie on as background noise while working on planning lessons, but I would not have made it to the credits had I been fully watching. As a matter of fact, I don't know that I would have made it past the first ten minutes.

No spoilers, but basically take a love triangle and set it on a deserted island...only make the ""good"" guy as passive aggressive and judgmental as possible and make the ""hot"" guy two-faced.  Add girl.  None of the characters were likeable or even very believable to me.

3922294,4,B002FLZM8M,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film, and found it enjoyable in a simple, clean way.

A Christian girl has been loosing her values over time, as she found herself caught up with her co-workers ideals and her adult life. Unbeknownst to her, a fellow co-worker who she pays little attention to was brought to Christ by her example when they first met (before she started to go ""off the rails"" so to speak).

When she is told that she will be sent to Indonesia on a business trip with the handsome, wealthy, successful office catch, she is excited to have a chance alone with him. The only problem? Her Christian co-worker who was converted by her example is also tagging along, and she fears that his presence will ruin her chances with her ""dream date.""

This is where the film takes a unique twist, and the trio end up stranded on a deserted island in Indonesia. Think ""Blue Lagoon"" meets tame, modernized Christian theme.

So who will like this film and who will not? Well, if you like beautiful scenery, particularly island / ocean scenery, and the whole ""stranded on a desert island"" narrative, you might have a chance of liking this film.

If you like clean entertainment, with a simple plot and a happy ending, you might have an even better chance of enjoying it.

However, if every film you watch has to have some dark, convoluted plot, or if every movie has to have a lot of drama and intricate depth, you might not like this. The story line is light, enjoyable, but very simplistic. You have to be able to have a light heart and just want to relax to something without a lot of drama, and be able to overlook some of the missing depth at times.

A few points that I did find unsettling: SPOILER ALERT from here on out: after the plane crashed, I found it odd that no one was very concerned about rescuing the pilots. The one character wanted to rescue Megan, but once he saw she was ok, they basically forgot about the pilots and swam to shore. Besides a few brief comments after that, no one seemed troubled that they had died or anything, which seemed off.

Also, there were scenes where their emotional reactions did seem a little flat, such as when Megan was hanging off the cliff and was rescued. It came across more as ""business as usual"" rather than a real concern. But overall the acting was passable, and was not absolutely horrid. Certainly not Oscar winning, but it was passable.

So if you want something lighthearted, clean, with beautiful tropical scenery, a subtle Christian message and a ""stranded on a desert island"" theme, this just may be for you. I enjoyed it. I was just looking to relax to something light. and was pleasantly surprised.",1464825600,2,2669,4.54375

3922529,3,B002FLZM8M,"Great story theme.
Compelling title.
Actual story was a little slow.  I'm confused about the Christian theme. Boy meets girl, loses girl to jerk, later gets girl. Prayer is shown.
I like the idea that SHE introduced him to Christ, and lost her way for a time by being influenced by the non-believers, but then he was the one to share with her what mattered in being a believer, and being saved.
I also like  the theme that when you believe in God, you don't need to be alone.
I thought for closure sake, it was necessary to have the boy get the girl in the end, and I do like that she ran after him later. Overall, story line was good. The movie was entertaining. Actors were good, and the island scenery was beautiful. Not my first choice of a movie, but it being Christian to me moves it up a notch because there does need to be more out there depicting the truth and power of God's grace.",1451174400,2,891,4.235294117647059

The woman just caved and acted like the world. The man, Chris, just was quiet...The island experience brought out the selfishness of all three, though Chris seemed to try to convince the woman that she was doing wrong. There was no real living for God in this movie..even by Chris. But at least it brought out the conflict about being like the world, following its philosophy or making a stand and following Christ.

Faith-based films are almost always made on very low budgets, and IMO this is one of the better ones in the genre. The story was good (not an action film), if a bit implausible. The acting is inconsistent. Dialogue is very natural, which sometimes translates to ""slow"" and ""boring"" on film. Still, I'm not a churchgoer, and I was interested enough to watch it to the end.

I felt like I was watching a movie that a small church made using members of the congregation as actors. But I think a church would be actually have been able to find better actors. Luckily, It was so bad, it actually became funny. As if I were watching a 2 hour SNL skit. So I actually finished the movie, which I can't say for all movies that are bad. So if you're looking to watch a deep spiritual movie that'll make you cry or think about god in a new way don't watch this movie. If you're looking for a romantic chick flick, don't watch this. If you want to see terrible acting and a cheesy plot line possibly written by an 11 year old (who's a major fan of lost or survivor), then this movie is for YOU!",1427414400,,843,4.115151515151515

3923185,1,B002FLZM8M,"Ugh. I'm actually mad at myself for sitting through the entire film. Thank goodness I watched this for free on Amazon Prime or I would be even more annoyed. Let me be clear, I have nothing against faith films. I am a Christian and can appreciate the efforts of those who are trying to make a quality movie about faith and spirituality.  But this is not one of those films.  While the plot  is interesting (though implausible) and the cinematography is gorgeous, the characters and their dialogue fall flat at virtually every turn.  It's a low-budget movie, but I have to believe there are better actors, directors, and editing crews available. ""Island of Grace"" displays the problems endemic in many independently-produced Christian films: poor acting, stock characters, stilted dialogue, and forced messages about the gospel. I just finished watching/reviewing ""October Baby""--a similar film which, while not great, at least  had a much more professional, talented cast and was better written than this film.  What really disturbs me about these films and many of the faith genre is their cinematic portrayal of women. In this case, I was once again dismayed to see the lead female character portrayed as a shallow, immature, indecisive woman who is apparently incapable of spiritual self-direction.  In both films (and others like them), you see the lead female (appropriately pretty, but not sexy) struggle haplessly with whatever spiritual and/or situational crisis she is experiencing.  She is shadowed by a safe, strong, solid Christian guy (appropriately cute, but not hot) whose firm faith, patience, and steady guidance are able to restore the wayward female to her ""proper"" state of mind and faith as they begin to inevitably fall in love. Oh please. This trope reinforces the notion that Christian women need to be led/directed by their Christian male partners in order to follow God's path effectively. That kind of patriarchal nonsense should have gone the way of the pterodactyl, but it is certainly alive and well in many traditional evangelical churches who still tout the subordination of wives to their husbands and view women as the weaker sex.  Once, just once, I'd like to see one of these heroines be the voice of reason and authority in the surrounding chaos. The strongest Christians I know are overwhelmingly female, so I reject the notion that young Christian women require the leadership of a male authority figure. I'd love to see a paradigm shift in these independent Christian films. Smart, steady, independent Christian women should be the ideal role model for modern girls--not weak, hyper-emotional creatures who depend on men to guide and save them.

Unfortunately, ""Island of Grace"" fits squarely into this feeble framework of silliness. I share the sentiments of another reviewer who said she found herself secretly hoping God would send a monsoon or a tsunami to wipe out the castaways. The three people stranded on the island seemed more concerned about whom to hook up with rather than a serious, concerted effort at survival and deliverance.  The love triangle plot was annoying yet predictable with characters who were either unrealistically narcissistic (Mark), ridiculously clueless (Megan), or irritatingly meek (Chris).  As such, their spiritual revelations seemed hollow and somewhat insincere.  Gratuitous faith messages were thrown in, but the writer missed a crucial opportunity to let the characters explore a deeper level of  their faith during a time that would no doubt fill them with fear, doubt, and questioning since they  alone  survived a plane crash and are stranded on a desert island.  They should be grappling with feelings of abandonment and loss,  their  sense of purpose in life, or some type of existential issue.  Instead, the most prominent spiritual issue here was Chriss annoyance at Megan for skipping church, going clubbing with her friends, and refusing to pray over a coconut dinner.  Really? Thats as deep as you can get in this situation?  There are so many meaningful opportunities that just slipped right past the writer and director.  So instead of a meaningful film like The End of the Spear or The Mission, you end up here with something more akin to Gilligans Island:  the sanctimonious version.  Honestly, this film played like a senior project in film school rather than a professional production. There are so many better inspirational films out there.  Please just skip this one and keep looking.",1407024000,8,4482,5.156077348066298

It was the script that was bad. OK I understand, you want to get your message out there, at least write  a script that allows a viewer to ""get"" the point.  9/10 of a;; of us are smart enough to understand the plot line and those that don't either are already in that camp or are hopeless. Given the goal to convert ""sinners"" to Christ it's a major fail. ain
Were the script written for the faithful I'd still call it a failure. The faithful not only realize ""their"" reality they likely realize the struggles of the non-believer to believer (assuming that they truly care). Ok there is a segment of the society that will defend whatever you you write as long as it fits their viewpoint and if that was who you wrote for then god bless you, you deserve the failure to both convert people to christinatity and entertain those that follow the faith.",1397865600,,994,4.367567567567567

More so than most movies, there is a lot to think about after the movie. The three characters represent three of the kinds of people in the world. The hero has strong faith but struggles with the issues a lot of guys do - how to connect with a girl he really likes. The heroine's faith is genuine, but represents those for whom the desires of the world have overwhelmed them somewhat. Finally, the anti-hero represents the highly successful worldly individual who seems to have it all yet finds faith development to be a waste of time.

The setting was contrived - a Pacific Island with conifers and trees you'd find on the East coast of the US.  THEN AS IF IT COULDN'T GET WORSE - IT DID!  Then it became a preachy BIble-banging sermon on how going to nightclubs during the week and working on Sunday makes a person a bad person.  I HAVE TO SAY I HAVE NEVER SEEN A WORSE FILM IN MY LIFE.

3923520,5,B002FLZM8M,"This is an awesome video:

1. You observe the importance of not allowing other things to distract you from Christ and why you are to live in such a way that Christ is in all that you do - work, school, fun & everything so that your life is all for the Glory of Christ.

2. You think about how your devotion to Christ could be what He is using to show others who He is. They may be the only image of Christ that they'll see and He wants us to show the world who He really is (not watered down or tagged with extra stuff that does not represent Him)

3. I also thought about the Grace of God, they survived from the plane crash and all were given life. Its seems 2/3 got the point (Chris & Megan, Mark went on with his life, business as usual he did not have time. On the island he said, "" I am too busy and God would take up too much of my time. ""
I recently survived a car accident across 5 lanes on the express way in Miami, by the Grace of God.
The scene with the plane going down really makes you realize how many do not escape the grips of death and may not know Jesus Christ.
I am so grateful to be alive, oh the Beauty of Grace! Amazing Grace!

I walk away from this film wanting to walk out my relationship with Jesus Christ and step out and live it, sometimes its hard, sometimes you have to do it alone, sometimes you'll look like a fool but just like Chris's friend told Megan as they walked into the office, ""If its important to you isn't it worth it?""

Let's allow God to guide us, Christ wants us to tell the World about Him and in our obedience He will provide you with all your hearts desires as a father bestowing gifts to his children - that includes romance, talents & gifts, employment, healing, transformation and spiritual gifts and the ""GOOD NEWS IS THE LIST GOES ON BECAUSE OF JESUS CHRIST AND HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM!""

LET'S LIVE THE LIFE IN CHRIST JESUS THAT HE HAS DIED TO GIVE US, ACCEPT HIS INVITATION:

""JESUS COME INTO MY LIFE.
FORGIVE ME OF ALL MY SINS.
I ASK YOU TO CLEANSE MY HEART,
AND MAKE ME A NEW PERSON IN YOU RIGHT NOW.
I ACCEPT YOU AS MY LORD AND SAVIOR!
RECIEVE ME INTO THE FAMILY OF GOD!
IN JESUS NAME I PRAY, AMEN!""

Know that You are never alone, "" These things I have spoken unto you, that in Jesus you might have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; Jesus has overcome the world ""(John 16:33) and "" You can do all things through Christ Jesus who STRENGTHENS you! ""(Phillipians 4:13)

Let me start off with the beginning. The first 2-3 minutes are spent watching a bunch of fish swimming in the ocean. Not a bad beginning, IF you were watching an ocean documentary. Then enters the worst plane crash of the century! Worst meaning unrealistic and cheesy. I thought someone had jumped into the water, not a huge plane landing in it.

The plot had potential, but they butchered it and made it very uninteresting.

 I have seen my fair share of cheesy, poor quality, badly acted movies. The story is weak, acting is terrible (I've seen animals with better acting skills for crying out loud) and their supposed ""faith"" is the weakest and most laughable thing of the whole movie. You never hear one single prayer you just see their lips moving. The main girl's shaky faith was too forced and weird to be taken seriously.

Oh, not to mention, the dudes (especially the guy from Belle and the Beast) were always ready to strip their shirts off and parade around half naked. It was very uncomfortable seeing up close shots of them. It's like they're trying too hard to be like Hollywood.
