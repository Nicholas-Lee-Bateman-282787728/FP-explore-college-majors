2388994,5,B000AJJNLI,I thought this miniseries was amazing. It may not have followed the history perfectly but it was an amazing story. I fell in love with all of the characters who were developed very well. The acting was unnaturally superb seeing as acting in miniseries usually ends up somewhat cheesy or overdramatic. I would highly recommend this series. It had me crying at many point. Buy it!,1135900800,,378,4.742424242424242
2388995,1,B000AJJNLI,"The real story of Octavian's rise to power, the real events, his real personality and that of Antony and others in the real story is so much more interesting than any fictionalized account could be --- especially one as awful as this. The story line of this series is stupid: Ceaser frees a gladiator/slave to protect Octavian, octavian runs into hiding and is eventually sold as a slave all the while being saved again and again by the faithful if crabby and under-appreciated gladiator and the inability of the near-satanic Cassius and swishy Brutus to kill him off. From one impossible situation to the next, Octavian's spoiled and wimpy self manages to suffer ill-deserved dumb luck. Octavians character in the series is the exact opposite of what is well described in authentic history; ditto for Antony, Brutus and Cassius.

All the events, characterizations and situations of this film are just plain silly. But again, why? when the reality of this historical episode and the people who were involved in it is so fascinating?? Sex, murder, intrique, wanton destruction, glory, its all there in the real thing and, unlike this series, it makes for a ripping good story. If the acting talent and resources employed to make this series had been put to a serious attempt at historical (and entertaining) film making it could have been great.",1134950400,28,1344,4.946902654867257
2388996,3,B000AJJNLI,"There is no way anyone would mistake this for a cinema production it really is just a middle of the road TV Mini-series nowhere near the quality of say ""Deadwood"" or ""Band of Brothers"". I will not compare this to ""Rome"" as I await that HBO version of the tale on DVD.

There is nothing really wrong with ""Empire"" except the performance of Mr Cake as Tyrannus the gladiator, bless him he is rather bland physically and vocally and instead off being a generator of energy to carry the story along is just a tall actor with a beard. Mr Regan as Anthony is interesting, seedy and greedy and not at all what one would expect

Great work from Mr Frain and moody photography and there are some great unexpected moments. I may even watch it again!",1133222400,4,739,4.386861313868613
2388997,3,B000AJJNLI,"So looked forward to seeing Empire, as it featured two British actors, who haven't received much attention this side of the pond...Jonathan Cake (Tyrannus) and James Frain (Brutus).

Unfortunately, although each gave fine performances, the mini-series was not terribly successful artistically and did not garner a large audience during its showing on American television.  Hopefully, they will soon be in other U.S. projects that will make better use of their talents.",1130112000,5,468,5.577464788732394
2388998,1,B000AJJNLI,"This miniseries is quite possibly the worst I have ever seen set in ancient times surpassing Cleopatra that aired a couple of years ago.  The need to shoe horn Tyrranus in altered what is, on its own, a remarkable and dramatic story in its own right.

Octavius was only 18 when Julius Caesar died and he proceeded to take on all the military and political bigwigs including Mark Antony.  Octavius raised his own army, marched on Rome, forced the government to punish Caesar's assassins, appointed himself consul over 20 years before he was eligible and became sole ruler of the Roman Empire by the age of 31.  That alone should have made the basis for an interesting miniseries.

As for this one, like a previous reviewer said the producers would have done much better to focus on the political machinations rather than setting up ridiculous scenerios such as having Octavius sold as a slave.  The acting over all is good and I particularly like Michael Byrne as Cicero.  I just wish the miniseries had been worthy of his talent.  If you want to see a really good miniseries check out HBO's Rome.  Not only is plot much more historically accurate, but the producers and director have managed to recreate a city that lives and breathes in comparison to cookie cutter sets in Empire.",1127260800,18,1281,4.708520179372197
2388999,5,B000AJJNLI,"When I first heard that ABC was going to be putting on a historical drama about the Roman Empire, I made sure that I was going to see it.  I was not disappointed.

Empire takes a heavily fictionalized account of the time after the assassination of Julius Caesar.  It is a compelling story and was very worth my time to watch as Octavian grows from the bratty patrician, to a criminal, to the leader of the Republic.  While the cast is not well known, they still pulled their parts off quite well.  And the decision to shoot in Italy was a wise one, as it gives a certain degree of authenticity to the show.

Now, those who are expecting a smaller version of Gladiator will be sorely disappointed.  While Gladiator was primarily an action movie, Empire is a drama, and furthermore, is without Russell Crowe.  The series is also best viewed with a degree of historical knowledge, so it may only appeal to history dorks like me.  Though if you do decide to view it, I believe you will not be disappointed.",1125273600,21,1002,4.461538461538462
2389000,3,B000AJJNLI,"It would be easy to castigate ""Empire,"" the eight-part minis-series aired on ABC this summer, by looking at how little it has to do with the actual period of Roman history beginning with the assassination of Julius Caesar and ending with the crowning of his nephew Octavius as Augustus, the first Roman emperor.  However, it is not like people are really familiar with Roman history or can be motivated to care about such trivial facts from the past.  Furthermore, it is clear the producers of ""Empire"" want you to be thinking more of ""Gladiator"" than ""I Claudius,"" and want to beat HBO's ""Rome"" to the punch as well.  That is why I have decided to take a different line of attack and chastise writer Tom Wheeler for ignoring the glory that was Rome in the movies.  Wheeler might be able to get away without reading Plutarch or Suetonius to develop this story, but ignoring ""Julius Caesar"" and ""Cleopatra"" is arguably a bigger affront to the gods.

The story of how Octavius became Augustus (""the boy who became a god"" according to ""Empire"") is certainly a story worth telling.  In terms of movies and mini-series there is a gap between the Octavius we find at the end of Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar"" and Elizabeth Taylor's ""Cleopatra,"" and the Emperor Augustus we meet at the start of ""I Claudius.""  Great things were expected of Julius Caesar, but not Octavius, so the fact that he succeeded is a riches to royalty story of some interest.  However, while Wheeler's script is interested in this transformation it does not make the transformation all that interesting.

Julius Caesar (Colm Feore) is at what would prove to be the heights of his power although he has still greater ambitions.  Well aware he is the eye of Rome's political hurricane, Caesar gives the gladiator Tyrannus (Jonathan Cake) his freedom and hires him as a bodyguard.  Unbeatable in the arena, Tyrannus has an Achilles heel in his love for his wife and son, which means he is not there when Brutus (James Frain) and Cassius (Michael Maloney) strike down Caesar in the Senate.  This time, after doing his variation on the ""Et tu, Brute?"" line Caesar survives long enough to tell Tyrannus to make sure he keeps Octavius alive.  The unspoken charge is that Tyrannus will help Octavius (Santiago Cabrera) grow up, so that instead of being a spoiled patrician he can become (wait for it) Caesar.

""Empire"" keeps trying to set up action sequences where Tyrannus has to save Octavius's life, but this is not ""Gladiator.""  The political intrigue is more interesting and the biggest problem is that the most fascinating character in the cast is Marc Antony (Vincent Regan).  When Caesar dies and names Octavius his heir, Antony does not even blink.  Was he passed over because Caesar found him unworthy or because the assassination came before Caesar was thinking long term?  Regardless, Antony looks at Octavius and does not see a Caesar.  The screenplay quickly removes the assassins from the scene and what we end up with is a life or death struggle between Octavius and Antony.  Fortunately Octavius has the will of Caesar, the help of not only Tyrannus but Antony's foe Cicero (Michael Byrne), and the good wishes of the Vestal Vrigin Camane (Emily Blunt).  All Antony has on his side is a smart wife, but she has no legions, where as Octavius stumbles across a lost one in the woods.

Octavius does have a few moments where you see the spark that will make him emperor, but there is no clear motivation for his evolution besides the fact the story assumes it takes place.  Besides twirling his swords Tyrannus has little to really say in terms of instruction, and Cicero, who would have plenty to say, decides to be overly cryptic for a great orator.  The sets look great and the casting is solid if not stellar.  Regan stands out because he is given the most to do and does it well while the rest of the cast struggles with the by the numbers approach to political ascension.  I find myself wishing that the death of Caesar had happened later in the story (akin to where Wild Bill Hickock buys it in the first season of  ""Deadwood""), not only because it would give Feore more to do but also because he could have started grooming young Octavius.

This last period of Civil War before the birth of the Roman Empire was filled with fascinating characters, important battles, and dangerous political intriques (Cicero was not only killed, but had his hands cuts off and a pin put through his tongue because of that attacks he wrote and spoke against Antony).  Clearly the model for ""Empire"" is ""Gladiator,"" but it should have been ""I Claudius.""  Certainly a Roman soap opera played out on a grand stage would have made much more compelling summer fare.  I will confess to having higher hopes for ""Rome,"" which will focus on the last years of the reign of Julius Caesar.",1122422400,95,4840,4.726190476190476

2389008,3,B000AJJNLI,"I bought this quite a while back but only got around to watching it recently.  Having done a student project on the rise of Octavius, I am somewhat familiar with this period of Roman history.  While I am perfectly fine with some artistic license, the degree of historical mangling was quite surprising.  There were too many historical inaccuracies for me to list but I will just mention some of the more egregious ones - (1) there was no missing Third Legion which Octavius conveniently found (how do you misplace an entire legion?).  Actually, Octavius started to build his military support by acquiring Julius Caesar's troops at Brundisium and helping himself to the war funds there; (2) how can any film of this period leave out Cleopatra?  (3) Octavius did not defeat Mark Antony in just one battle.  Actually, they fought together as allies and also against each other in a series of battles, culminating in the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra's joint forces in the battle of Actium.  As to entertainment value, the film is OK.  The acting is generally good and I particularly enjoyed the performance by Emily Blunt.",1374710400,,1125,4.853403141361256

2389015,3,B000AJJNLI,"Empire was a six-installment miniseries that premiered on ABC midsummer of 2005, and is one of their most ambitious projects, filming on location in Rome.

Newly returned from the battlefield, Julius Caesar (Colm Feore) is not pleased to find that so little has been accomplished in his absence. The senate continues to quarrel like petulant children, and his nephew Octavius (Santiago Cabrera) is known more for his love of beautiful women than his influence and wit. When the success of a mighty gladiator known as Tyrannus (Jonathan Cake) strikes his interest, Caesar approaches the slave with a proposition: if he will swear loyalty to the House of Caesar, and work as a protector of Octavius, he will be given his freedom. Tyrannus accepts, but on the day he is to escort Caesar to the senate, his child is kidnapped.

Tracking down and recovering his son means that he is not present when Caesar is betrayed by the senators, who kill him in cold blood. His vicious murder enrages the citizens of Rome and the fury of Caesar's loyal second-in-command, Marc Anthony (Vincent Regan). Senator Cassius (Michael Maloney) knows the public will tear them apart if the truth is known, and seeks to use Caesar's sister to calm the mob. Tyrannus was present to hear the dying words of Caesar, that he passed his legacy and armies on to Octavius. Certain that the young man's life now lies in peril, Tyrannus pleads with him to flee from Rome. In the meanwhile, Caesar's will has been given into the keeping of Camane (Emily Blunt), one of the Vestal Virgins in the Temple. Her loyalty is to the goddess she serves, but her patriotism stands for the good of Rome.

One of the most brilliantly-written epics I have seen in a long time, Empire is full of rich characters and dramatic situations, from the return of Caesar to the joy of a screaming crowd to the blood on the final battlefield. The first disk in the series (which contains the first three episodes) is fantastic, and manages to keep semi-accurate to history, but the second disk was much more of a disappointment. Strong acting carries through, but most of its incidents are impractical fables that don't present historical characters in a very true or good light. I have never been a fan of Marc Anthony, but this series makes him out to be a diabolical, self-serving villain. That may very well be true, but has historians screaming in outrage. I also found it difficult to believe that a series could involve him so much and yet never make any mention of his pursuit of Cleopatra.

The sets, costumes, and cinematography are amazing. It is a realistic depiction of life in Ancient Rome, from the gritty underground tunnels to the magnificence of the senatorial room where Caesar was betrayed and murdered by the men he trusted. Names like Brutus, Agrippa, and even Cicero are present, accompanied by a beautiful musical score and surprisingly emotional performances. Maloney is despicable, and Regan is a surprisingly dark and multi-layered Marc, but the entire miniseries belongs to Jonathan Cake. He has the most expressive eyes I have ever seen in an entertainer, and some of his scenes will have you shed more than a few tears on his behalf. I also very much liked Blunt's presence as a priestess who thinks more of the empire than she does her celestial duties.

However... in the second half, the sexual content becomes extreme, with one of the most revolting and exploitive orgy scenes I have ever seen on public television. If there HAD to be an orgy, there were better ways of implying one that were not so offensive; and everyone knows Marc was a notorious womanizer; we don't need to graphically see it. Still, if you can tolerate script writers playing fast and hard with historical events, you'll no doubt be seduced by the emotional impact and dramatic emphasis of Empire.",1332374400,,3846,4.803625377643504
2389016,1,B000AJJNLI,"After watching 'Augustus' - which like this movie focuses on first century BC Rome with a focus on Octavian Caesar/Caesar Augustus - I thought it wouldn't be possible to find a movie about this fascinating period with both worst acting and worst history. I was wrong. At least 'Augustus' had Peter O'Toole. This movie lacks even a single redeeming performance.

As for the history, I don't expect exact historicity, but I would prefer movies not be made if they are going to be this far off. 'Empire' could hardly have been worse. For the central character, Octavian in this movie spends most of the time trying to deny his patrimony, not wanting to be 'Caesar.' If there is anything which is clear from the historical record, it is that from the time of Caesar's death and the revelation that his will gave the young man almost everything, including his name, Octavian sought absolute power, and would stop at nothing for that. This is clear even from sources friendly to him. And of course the way the Octavian-Mark Antony rivalry is portrayed is almost entirely fictitious.

And I would have thought a pro-Caesar bias would be out of fashion these days. Both 'Augustus' and 'Empire' portray Caesar as he wanted to be portrayed - as a man of the people, wanting to bring justice to the poor of Rome. While Caesar had some admirable qualities, he used his gifts to obtain supreme power and destroy the Republic. He showed no qualms at the use of corruption and political violence in doing so.

It's accurate in the sense that it takes place in Italy and that Caesar was assassinated, but beyond that it's pretty laughable.

2389027,2,B000AJJNLI,"It may not be fair to compare this production with HBO's Rome, since Rome had a larger budget and a broader and less inhibited cast, but even leaving Rome out of the picture, Empire was simply lacking.

I found myself bored much of the time I was viewing Empire, and can't say I ever got into it to the point where I was excited about what I was seeing. Where in both its seasons the more glorious Rome looked like it could hold its own against any motion picture, Empire pathetically radiated its status as the offspring of the small screen. The actors in Empire were bland men and women who gave meek performances, historical fact was trampled for the sake of plot, and more than once Empire disintegrated into a swordfight action flick instead of an historic piece concerned with the politics of Rome's most dire power struggle.

Excusing limitations in budget, I'll say the scenery in Empire was at times good and on occasion was worth looking at rather than what was happening onscreen with the human cast. A stroll Tyrannus and Julius Caesar (who reminded me for all the world of Michael Gross, the father from Family Ties) took across a beautiful hillside early in the picture stands out in my mind as a good example of this.

Empire is a study in why the big three broadcast networks (or is it four or five now) cannot hope to compete with cable. On cable larger budgets and artistic license grant storytellers free reign, while the anachronistic and oppressive standards of the FCC force commercial broadcasters to stay confined to limitations any intelligent viewer accustomed to cable programming can't take seriously anymore. Empire might've been noteworthy had it been shown in the 1980's, because frankly that's what it reminded me of: an outdated, lackluster miniseries ""event"" from the days of my childhood.

Watch ""Rome"". The casting is superb, the sets are authentic and make one feel as if he were there, and it follows history as closely as it can. None of the actors (especially the ones who played Cicero and Octavian) come close to inhabiting their characters like the cast of ""Rome"". As for the people who have compared this to ""Gladiator"", may Russell Crowe come and behead you in your sleep for such blasphemy. ""Gladiator"" was amazing, with an all star cast, breathtaking action scenes, a deep and noble message, and a gorgeous script.

2389029,3,B000AJJNLI,"This is quite an ambitious, entertaining and interesting work of historical fiction.  The story opens just before the Ides of March and takes us through the beginning of the reign of Octavion (who would come to be known as Caesar Augustus).  At the outset, it needs to be admitted that there are a great many liberties taken with history in this film.  Even calling it a ""representation"" of what actually took  place would be a bit of  a stretch.

The story centers on a fictional gladiator named Tyrannus who is assigned to be Octavion's body guard after his uncle Julius is assasinated.  One of the things that this movie DOES get right (historically) is that Octavion is portrayed as being right around 18 years old.  That is entirely accurate.  Octavion was this age when he went to Rome to claim his inheritance.  Most movies  I have seen that deal w/this time period portray Octavion as a grown man, which is false.

The movie does a good job of invoking some personages and cultural institutions of Rome that don't normally get a lot of air-time in movies about Rome.  Among these are Octavion's best friend and best general, Agrippa.  Another is Rome's greatest orator, Marcus Tullius Cicero.  The tradition of the Vestal Virgins is also tied into the story in a clever way.

A curious omission to this time frame is the character of Cleopatra.  There is an Egyptian girl in the movie, but we're not told her name and she has such a bit part as to be almost an afterthought.  Obviously the storyline demanded that they go in a different direction, but it's still somewhat odd to look at this period w/out Cleopatra being involved.

All in all, this is a fairly well done effort.  The acting is solid and the direction is pretty good.  The biggest fault that I can see is that it seemed incomplete.  They failed to tie up some loose ends, and I found that irritating.  The ending to me seemed to fizzle out somewhat instead of being dramatic.

This is the height of the Roman empire. Characters are dressed like braveheart extras or rejects from the world wrestling federation.

Next, we see young Octavius flirting with a vestal virgin. Come on people? A vestal virgin? They were kept under lock and key and chaperoned.  Roman women were not roaming around on the streets and speaking their minds to rich upperclass men unless they were loose.

This was overall, pretty cheesy, and worse boring- I'm having trouble maintaining my interest.",1152748800,52,746,5.040650406504065
2389032,1,B000AJJNLI,"GARBAGE! GARBAGE! GARBAGE!  AAIIIEEEEEEE! My brain is melting. I have never written a review on Amazon before, but after sitting through this Turkeyosaur (I can't believe I watched the whole thing, I think I was mesmerized and rendered unable to respond by hitting the off-switch by an evil spirit)I felt it my duty to my fellow man and woman to warn them about it.  This is the most ludicrous and ridiculous piece of junk ever reduced to celluloid.  It makes Plan Nine from Outer Space look like a combination of Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, To Kill a Mockingbird and Ben-Hur.  Everybody associated with this thing would be banned from the film industry for life if there were any justice.  It bears no semblance to history after the first twenty minutes, the only things even remotely historical are the names of the supposedly historical characters. The writing is awful, the acting is awful and everybody looks like they are walking through a grungy music video. Can't anybody make a decent historical costume drama anymore?  The only decent ones of the last fifteen years have been Tombstone and Master and Commander, but this one is by far the worst.  Has everybody's brain turned to jello?  They're laughing at us, folks! Please, please don't support these fools and dumbdowners by buying this! I'm burning the copy I have as a sacrifice in an attempt to appease the muse of drama.  My only regret is that Amazon won't let me post a lower rating.....",1148515200,41,1460,4.7848605577689245
2389033,3,B000AJJNLI,"Empire brings to the screen the rise to power of one of the most well known historical figures: Roman Emperor Octavius Augustus.

Nevertheless, it is a series that brings to life the director's version of how he would have liked Octavius' rise to be.  The movie does not faithfully follow the sources associated with the well known Roman emperor (even though historians should have been hired to do just that), rather it is a film BASED on and INSPIRED by the legendary emperor, and therefore has a great deal of flaws and deviations from the truth.

One could list one after another the discrepancies that occur, and for those that have read/studied Roman History, it is common knowledge that the list would be very long indeed, some will say too long...  From this very long list the most important alteration was in relation to the historical discrepancies regarding the ""disappearance"" of the co-regency between Octavius and Marc Anthony that seems to have miraculously slipped the writers' minds, not to mention that Julius Caesar is to have perished on the Senate steps, and not while sitting inside the Senate.

As other reviewers have also pointed out, the series starts off pretty well and it is mainly in the second half that Empire goes ""Xena"" on us.

Therefore, once it is established that this is a work of fiction and not an historical adaptation things change, though the problems do not go away, they just transform;

1) To start with, Empire is very biased against the Senate, the Patricians, and even/especially Marc Anthony!

2) Where is the piety and sternness associated with Augustus?

2) Octavius seems to be getting out of too many impossible situations too often.

3) The slave out of nowhere, Tyrannus, attempts to provide a Spartacus/Gladiator feel that does not need to be present in a film about Octavius.

4) No one recognized Tyrannus or Octavius in the Gladiator School (!!!)

5) Magonius was a little too dark to be a Roman General (of the 4th Legion).

6) The ""Legendary 3rd"" while interesting (!) was like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean and LOR's Return of the King more than anything else.

7) The nurse at Marc Anthony's villa was more Nubian than Egyptian.

8) Marcus Agrippa was a teenager!

And the list goes on and on...

On the positive side, the acting and cast are very good (overall).

Moreover, the setting, the dialogues and the costumes are also commendable!

Even though this is a Hollywoodish production and one should be more flexible and lenient when dealing with adaptations, one should also keep in mind that this is Octavian Augustus in question and not some petty, modern leader.  Therefore, the only real problem arises when the majority of people (and most people have NOT read/studied the sources) who see the series start believing that events happened the way the film depicts/portrays and not the way they actually occurred.  Consequently, due to these distortions, the movie establishes a very serious threat of producing armies of misinformed people who think they have accurate knowledge of Octavius Augustus when they really do not.  That is NOT good!

The dead heroes would be turning in their graves if they knew what is being written and said about them by people who are either misinformed or are purposely out to distort the truth in following their own personal agendas.

Hopefully, more films will be made set in the ancient times, as the demand for them is definitely there, but please let's make them accurate.

In a nutshell, though not a masterpiece, Empire will provide for an evening's entertainment, especially for those with a soft spot for History and all things Roman, though you might not want to go as far as purchasing it.",1146960000,14,3719,4.865079365079365
2389034,3,B000AJJNLI,"First off, this has some serious areas where it is just Historically inaccurate; especially the big stuff.  On the small stuff, it appears to be more accurate.  So, maybe Wheeler started with something Historical and his bosses told him to make it smaller and tighter b/c there wasn't enough money.

In truth, Octavius and Antony were allies with a Marcus Lepidus.  This went on for several years until Antony went to war against Octavius for all of Rome, joining up with Cleopatra.  If you don't want to read the books, watch the old ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA.

Next, there were several wars between Antony and Octavius, including some major naval battles, so, the battlefield of war here was too small.

Third, August came across as super green here.  Based on History I suspect he wasn't so naive. According to Suetonius, for instance, he tried to poison Antony once or twice with assassins.

Fourth, the manner in which Caesar was slain appeared accurate. The actor who played him did a good job.

Five, Brutus and Cassius led several armies against Antony and Octavius and Lepidus . .. they lost to the triumverate.

Sixth, while there were attempts on the life of Octavius, accounts show that he stayed in Rome and was in politics shortly after Caesar's death.  Once he took power, though, he always showed up to the Senate in armor and with bodyguards.  Heh.

Seventh, not sure about the legend of the Third Legion in Gaul. I have to look into that one to see if there's any truth.

Eighth, Rome was a society based on law and order rather than a focus on goodness and kindness to others. Something to remember when comparing our morals to those of Rome.

Ninth, Antony really was a drunkard.  Accounts claim he showed up so drunk he could barely find his seat in the Senate.

Tenth, the actor who played Cicero was done quite well.

Eleventh, I don't remember if a total assassination was done against the supporters of Octavius per the series.  Suetonius doesn't make mention of it so it may have been made up.

Twelfth, the costumes and visuals of the areas are close to accurate.  I feel this is a great touch.

Thirteenth, the colosseums in Rome were like the one in GLADIATOR.  I can only surmise there were budget problems as they used an inexpensive setting.  Well, for movies it's inexpensive.
Probably still $100k or more.

Fourteenth, if you want to watch a series that is fun, intriguing and highly accurate in History, check out I, CLAUDIUS.  Done in the 70s and based on Graves' novels but still very close to how it was (i.e. though all the poisonings are unlikely as people always claimed it was poison when someone died of something they could not explain).

Fifteenth, Tyrranus probably wasn't real but History is vague enough in that area where who really knows?

P.S. I do love some movies that are inaccurate historically, just not this one.  Heh.  BRAVEHEART, for instance, was fabulous even if the real French princess of history was about 7 years old.  They probably wore helmets in battle, too, and there was no bridge shown at the Battle of Stirling. Yes, there was a bridge vital to the battle.

GLADIATOR was good but not great.  Still loved the era and have watched it several times.  Problems there was that Emperor Commodus, son of Marcus Aurelius, didn't die in the colosseum against a general.  Someone vying for the throne sent a wrestler to strangle him in the baths.  Commodus, by the way, did have a sister and there were talks of you know what, but, I don't recall him quenching a General Maximus.  Fights in the rings, including tigers springing out of the trapdoors in the floor was very accurate . .. they were famous for such things.",1145750400,4,3677,4.669781931464175
2389035,4,B000AJJNLI,"I quite enjoyed watching this. I thought it was well-written and produced, with good dramatic touches. It's at least two steps up from the drek miniseries that are produced for the sci-fi channel or FX by the bushell lately.

But it's not a truly great work.

This is basically a revisit to the substance and style of Russell Crowe's Gladiator, which was itself excellent, but time has passed and this feels like a well-intentioned retread instead of an original work.

They should have filled out the cast and modeled it after the Soprano's, or copied the style of the BBC's sublime I-Claudius directly.  But they don't appear to have the talent or nimble touch for that kind of character-based work.

Still, young Octavian makes several key decisions and grows in the role, and many characters had mixed motives and some real depth. It didn't talk down to the audience.  They really needed to make a longer miniseries for everything to come to full fruition.

So there was something there. So one should enjoy this for the well-written, fun, heavy-handed historical soap opera as it is. It's a worthy, enjoyable entertainment.",1143763200,9,1128,4.905263157894737

2389037,1,B000AJJNLI,"When I watched this, I decided I had a moral obligation to warn people from buying this DVD set!!

The good: The series was filmed in Italy, and the actor who plays Anthony is pretty good. That's it.

The bad: The film is a direct rip off of the movies ""Gladiator"", ""Spartacus"", and even ""The Beastmaster"". And every character fits some Roman cliche: The hero is surrounded by corrupt senators, a wise poet, his love interest is a Vestal Virgin, and he's saved by a gladiator time and time again.

And forget history. The writers just made it up from scratch. That wouldn't be so bad, except that the story they came up with is far less interesting than what really happened. And incredibly, in the interviews section, one of the writers said he wanted to present a ""realistic"" picture of Rome! Just a few of the departures from history: Somehow they forgot to even mention Cleopatra in this conflict, and they also forgot that the decisive battle between Anthony and Octavian was fought at sea, not land. Its also nice to know that ancient Rome was an integrated society like the USA, with the same black/white ethnic mix and even a black man as its most powerful general!

There's one scene that's so ridiculous it defies belief. An animal trainer villian dressed like the ""beastmaster"" lets loose his trained snakes (there is no such thing as a ""trained snake""!!), which kill an entire mansion full of guests at a party, with the bodies laying around covered in blood - I'm not joking here!

Jeez, at least they could have thrown in some gratuitous nudity, or something! If you want to see a better version of the events of this period, I would recommend instead the HBO ""Rome"" series, the ""Cleopatra"" mini-series starring Timothy Dalton, or the Elizabeth Taylor version of ""Cleopatra"". Or even read Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar"", its far closer to actual History.",1139961600,65,1867,4.75

Coincidentally, it starts from where 'Rome' finished and is truly a worthy successor. The transfer from HD is immaculate, almost as good as a High Definition broadcast. Sets and costumes are impressive and there appears to be no expense spared with the budget.
