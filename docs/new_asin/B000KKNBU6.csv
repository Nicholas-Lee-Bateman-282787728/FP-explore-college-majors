8157784,1,B000KKNBU6,I received these DVDs and they are mostly just poor copies of free material online.  One of the DVDs would not even play.  I notified the company and they didn't even bother to reply.,1290211200,,183,4.352941176470588
8157785,1,B000KKNBU6,"While there is quite a bit of content, the packaging is atrocious. Once you finally manage to close the cheap case, all 4 DVD-Rs (which are labeled in Sharpee) will come loose and slide all over the place. Seriously, they will not stay, no matter how delicate you are. The DVD art consists of a poorly placed pixelated picture of a mushroom cloud, on a white piece of paper, with some Arial text. Honestly, you're better off finding the same torrent this guy used, and making your own DVDs, as these will probably just get scratched during the shipping process, like mine did.",1263945600,2,576,4.601941747572815
8157786,3,B000KKNBU6,"This DVD has very good selection of old short films.  They are great reminders of the times when some of us were in school. However,the disc quality (the way it has been put together) is very amateurish.",1247097600,2,203,4.486486486486487
