However, this film had my dropping my jaw because of the inaccuracies. They had the numbering of the Presidents completely off, the years they were in office, COMPLETELY off, even some of the facts were not true. I thought it was a joke at first and then I realized, IT WASN'T. Never in my life have i seen a historical film with such inaccurate information. I suggest NEVER buying this product because it will lead you astray!",1304726400,2,593,4.4495412844036695
8089499,5,B000BNX4HW,"What a great idea this is! I watched it with my kids (14 and 17) and we all learned so much in just over an hour. It's a great way to learn about our Constitution, which, I'm sure most Americans don't know. I sure didn't. Reading it as a family brought up a lot of great discussions, such as how it relates to current events like the recent election and current economical crisis. If I had just picked up a book and read it by myself, I don't think I would have gotten as much out of it. And by watching it on TV my kids enjoyed it more than reading the book, which they said would have felt like homework.  And my kids got so much out of it because as they read certain sections, they could see how some areas of the Constitution are being abandoned. If everyone knew this and held their reps accountable, we probably wouldn't be facing the crises (plural!) we're facing.",1227225600,5,872,4.221556886227545

8089501,5,B000BNX4HW,"Perfect.  This is the Constitution as it is, not as some pundit or radio talk show host says it ""should"" be.  Every American should know what is in this document, what it means and how it affects their lives.  This document makes the freedoms and the country we have possible.

There were plenty of things that I thought I knew about the Constitution and after watching this I learned even more.  I'll need to watch it over and over to make sure it all sinks in.

There should be a copy of this in every home in America.",1214438400,3,520,4.255102040816326
