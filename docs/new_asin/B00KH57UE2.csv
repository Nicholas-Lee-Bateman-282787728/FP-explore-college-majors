Review of the series
[...]",1404864000,2,113,4.380952380952381
6426941,4,B00KH57UE2,"I would say this should be a must for those who are already die-hard BL (meaning Blood Lad, not Boy Love!) Manga Fans, but for those who, like me, are more casual Anime watchers, you may need to pass on this until the price comes down a great deal before you'll feel satisfied in the value.

Blood Lad is imaginative and fun, but the price is quite steep considering it's a short (10 episode) series that leaves you hanging.  Not cliff-hanging, just hanging wondering where the 4 remaining episodes that would have wrapped up the story arc are.  It's quite possible there won't be more either.  An additional single episode OVA was made, but it's not clear if that is included in this $54 price tag.

And to those of you who are going to cry and moan that I didn't give this adaptation of your favorite anime less than 5 stars, grow up. I'm just trying to give prospective buyers information to help them spend their money wisely.",1404518400,29,930,4.479289940828402
6426942,5,B00KH57UE2,"This is an excellent anime in my opinion. I'm just really into the vampires and demon world stuff. I was so excited that they finally dubbed it.

Here is an overview of the story so you can decide for your self.

Staz is the main character, he is a vampire and the leader of East Demon world. The Demon world is divided into territories with a different demon in charge of each territory. A demon is made the leader of a territory by defeating the previous leader of that territory. The story doesn't get in to all of the different leaders, we only meet a few of them, and the only two to take note of are Staz and his friend Wolf (a werewolf).

Staz is a laid back slacker type of person who spends all of his time playing video games, watching anime and reading manga; until one day when a human girl named Fuyumi finds her way into the demon world.
Staz doesn't get a chance to drink her blood because she is eaten by a plant and subsequently turns into a ghost.

The main focus of the story is Staz trying to figure out a  way to bring Fuyumi back to life after he promises her he will. The story takes place all over the demon world and we are introduced to many interesting characters. On this note I will say that the character development is not the greatest, but how can it be with only 10 episodes in this first season (hoping a second season will come out). We are also introduced to other issues that different characters are dealing with, such as Staz's older brother Braz, and his hatred and plans against the current Demon King, because he killed their parents (their father was the previous demon king). And Bell, a spatial magic user who is searching for the powerful demon that stole some of her magic. All of these separate issues also involve Staz in some way or other.

There are no DBZ, Inuyasha type of big, long, drawn out battles here (not that I cant appropriate a 4 episode battle). There are fight scenes that involve regular fighting and transforming, but what I like about the fight scenes are the cool powers that are used, for example, staz has a cool power that allows him to squeeze his opponents  heart and kill them without touching them. With powers like that most of the fights are not very long.

This anime is a dark comedy and at times sort of even makes fun of the cheesy anime, manga things that we come to expect, such as the nose bleeds and long DBZ type attacks that take forever to power up, yet no one attacks them in the mean time. I found it to be funny and interesting, That being said the story is not a revolutionary one, but it's one that I loved all the same.

In summery, I love this anime and would love to buy it, but will not at that $70 price tag. I did not want to give the anime itself a bad rating just because the price sucks. I hate when people do that because the rating is for the product itself and the review can go into the specifics of what you like/ don't like. when I see a 1 star I assume its because you didn't like the product, not the price. Anyway, sorry about that tangent. I hope the price goes down, which I assume it will once it has been out for a while.

I hope you decide to give it a watch on animepalm or wherever you enjoy your anime before you buy it. It is worth a watch, even if you don't like it, it's only 10 episodes long :)",1404086400,8,3318,4.194662480376766

6426959,4,B00KH57UE2,"I am just going to say how amazing this anime was, I am very picky when it comes to anime since I watch many and sometimes I cannot review all of them, the only thing I honestly didn't like about this anime was on how very short it was it had so much potential. :I that is why I had to rate it 4 stars. I would recommend it, it could've been a lot better if they continued to make more of the episodes, well only one can dream",1433116800,5,426,3.797752808988764
6426960,4,B00KH57UE2,"the only reason i don't give this 5 stars is becouse it should have one episode more or a second season

it is a great series about an anime / manga fan vampire that meet a Girl from the human world it migth sound stupid when i say it like that but the story is actually werry fun and i would recomand it. but if you want to understand manny of the jokes there i recomand you to see dragonball first for manny of the jockes is about that anime.

but it is the end that don't make me want to give it 5 stars still it is worth the money and your time",1430352000,2,548,3.7982456140350878

6426962,5,B00KH57UE2,"It came on time and un-damaged. (Always a must) The box has a nice hard cover and art on both sides. The DVD/Blu-ray and extra booklet slips out the side. The booklet is in full color and has a episode list, character profile list, a section on background art and a bonus manga in the back that's around the length of a single chapter in the Blood Lad manga series. The DVD and Blu-ray are in a standard Blu-ray box with a total of four discs. (2 Blu-ray and 2 DVD.)

8658771,5,B00KH57UE2,"Absolutely AMAZING anime that is way too under the radar. It has a great cast of big name VA that I can't believe how little promotion it got and you have to actually go digging to find this gem. Bryce Pappenbrook is one of my favorite VA and I was going through his anime titles and found this and figured I'd check it out. It's got Johnny Yong Bosch in it and even Todd Habberkorn.

The story is demon type characters in an alternate world that has a human girl shoved into it. She ends up dying 15 minutes in and become a ghost. The whole plot is based around Staz, a vampire, vowing to return her to her body and her own world. It's got fan service; but, nothing totally inappropriate. My only complaint is where it ends as it is a HUGE cliffhanger. There is a mange, which I also high recommend, though and you can continue on from there. The plot follows pretty closely to the manga, which I love. IT's only 10 episodes and 1 OVA so it's not a super long time commitment and I think it's a great unknown anime that most people would enjoy.",1486857600,5,1045,4.199004975124378
