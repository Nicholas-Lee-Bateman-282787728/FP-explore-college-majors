A wide breadth of marine mammals were covered with some very interesting live footage along with a passionate and inspirational appeal to care for and value the wonder of this wildlife and their environment.  The product was obviously created by a single tour guide, no doubt with an interest in promoting his business, but it transcends this consideration quite remarkably.",1449273600,,484,5.1923076923076925

8069306,5,B0009X9DOM,"I'm not sure if Captain Dave has won some type of award for this documentary, but HE DEFINITELY SHOULD! This is a truly amazing... dare I say... work of art! The captain has taken dolphin and whale documentary to another level. Well, I'll even go as far as to state the obvious, for those who have invested in a home theater system complete with, movie projector, movie screen, surround sound.. You know, the works... You are REALLY in for a treat and will be watching this documentary the way that it should be watched.",1440288000,,520,4.542553191489362
8069307,5,B0009X9DOM,"The information was very eye opening as to marine life right off the Southern California Coast.  I used it as a teaching aide for my classroom and the only complaints I heard was the narrators voice was somewhat monotone. I felt the information, the visual footage, and reasonable price more than compensated for that.  It made me want to book a trip with Captain Dave.",1386460800,,369,4.661538461538462
8069308,5,B0009X9DOM,"We loved Captain Dave's tour and highly recommend supporting him through buying his merchandise directly from him.  After spending the big bucks for his tour for a large family, however, we saved by purchasing a gently used copy for our kiddo to watch.  Dave is very knowledgeable about the marine wildlife of Southern California and he is very engaging.",1377216000,,354,4.983050847457627
8069309,5,B0009X9DOM,"Beautiful close-up footage of many different types of whales and dolphins, with interesting and informative commentary from the Captain. You feel as though you're on the boat with him. And, you gain a better understanding and appreciation these amazing animals after viewing this DVD.",1331510400,,284,5.4772727272727275
8069310,5,B0009X9DOM,"This video provides a unique and fun perspective of whales and dolphins off the coast of Southern California. Few people realize the wealth of amazing wildlife that is in these waters, including the largest of all known animals ever on the earth, the blue whale. Captain Dave's narration shows his love for the animals, and he adds simple scientific facts to help us understand them. I went blue whale watching on his boat after seeing this video, and on the trip we saw five blue whales as well as a pod of countless numbers of dolphins.",1281139200,,538,4.614583333333333
8069311,5,B0009X9DOM,"I have sailed with Captain Dave on two previous occasions, and I wanted to take my entire family, kids and grandkids, on a special adventure this summer.  As part of my gift to them, I purchased copies of the DVD for each of my families to help them prepare for this trip.  It is an amazing film, with views of our friendly sea animals that are not usually seen.  I highly recommend it, not only for fun, for a great learning experience.  Go Captain Dave!",1264291200,,455,4.317647058823529
8069312,4,B0009X9DOM,"This wonderful DVD may not have IMAX-calibre imagery, but it shows a greater number and variety of whales than any other video I have seen, and sticks to whale-watching without sidebars or cut-aways.

It is professionally produced and not hand-held home movies. Most of the video is amazing, tho some underwater scenes are grainy. It is also more personal and educational than many videos, and I appreciate that the narrative is done while viewing the whales, without cutting away to animation or extended science lessons.

Captain Dave and crew clearly love their subject matter, and marvel at them along with us!",1156377600,3,614,5.069306930693069
