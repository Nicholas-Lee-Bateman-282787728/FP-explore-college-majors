I think this is a lovely film, with a lot of humour and light, which nevertheless it's not  light in its content, as it shows how stupid war is (these italian soldiers  lost in an idilic greek war are informed one day by someone arriving from  the outside that their former enemy is now their ally!) Lovely film,  definitively a must, and among my ten favourite films.",947289600,12,495,4.466666666666667

The transfer is something to be desired but personally I had more issue with the fact that this dvd is 4:3 ratio (pan &scan) and it was not disclosed on the website.

My Italian family say that the actions of the Italian soldiers is very realistic and they get a great kick out of the movie every time we see it together.",1398038400,,476,3.865979381443299
491943,5,630267672X,"This is a good movie. There are plenty of reviews here. I am baffled though. This movie came out on VHS in 1992. They never made a DVD conversion for this movie ? The only DVD of this movie comes from Brazil. They did a bad job on converting it. Chopped screen, no better video quality. Changed the color of the subtitles from easy to read yellow to white which blends in to the background on some sences. I think this movie got an Acadamey Award. It's been over 20 years and no real DVD or Blu-Ray ? Just VHS and a low quality foreign VHS to DVD conversion. The scenery in this movie is great. Any one who ever fondly spent time in the Greek Islands will love this. If they put Howard The Duck on DVD why not this ? Why !",1396051200,3,722,4.020833333333333
491944,4,630267672X,"I love this movie, so I hope others will watch it.  I like Mediterraneo because it is about people trying to find their purpose or way in life.  I think part of the positive message of the movie is that it indeed is possible to find happiness and purpose.  However, like many films and books about finding purpose (Family Man, Lion King, The Alchemist, Siddhartha) finding purpose for these characters occurs as a result of getting away from their previous life and having time to reflect. It is not only a thoughtful film, it is also quite funny.  My only criticism is that the quality of the picture is average.  It looks kind of like a VHS copy of the movie.  The story is 5-star, but the copy is just average.",1395878400,5,713,4.404580152671755

491946,5,630267672X,"It's good that this film has made it to DVD. I ran across this movie years ago on VHS in a video store. As a university student long before that I spent a summer on a small Greek island working on an archeology dig. Living on that island among the farmers and fishermen and their families, in their tiny village (one backpacking tourist showed up that summer) was a beautiful experience.  Those people were the finest part of humanity you could ask to be with. So I rented the video just to see some of the same kind of Greek island landscape and buildings and people again. I was very satisfied with that aspect. At least one reviewer is not happy with the scenics of this film, but the real beauty of Greece's islands is a subtle, quiet thing and one can't expect to be overwhelmed by it on a television screen. The island is a star, but the story and atmosphere of this film is what really carries one away. See this movie. It is true. Like the Italian soldiers in the film, I was full of sadness when I had to leave the island and go back to the 20th century.",1392076800,,1063,4.236453201970443

491978,3,630267672X,"Fun and filled with several excellent performances, but I can certainly see why this was a surprise Oscar winner for best foreign language film since it lacks depth. In addition, it feels like the creative forces behind the film tried to cram too much in to the brief 96 minute running time. Still, not a bad film by any means, yet altogether somewhat too breezy to be taken seriously.",1375833600,,385,4.594202898550725

491980,5,630267672X,"The Italian speakers in my house love this movie, unfortunately depending on what version you get, (there is no way to tell what your getting when you order), some people get English subtitles and some don't. I did not, somewhat making it hard for me to enjoy the movie. But the product itself was good. Be aware when ordering they can not verify subtitles in English.",1369180800,,368,4.590909090909091

491983,5,630267672X,"This delightful comedy is set on a tiny Greek island during WWII, when a rag-tag group of Italian soldiers is sent to occupy it for the Axis.  The soliders hail from different parts of Italy; you have a representation of a number of regional stereotypes, from the ambitious Milanese sargent to the provinicial herder whose strongest attachment is to his donkey.  Soon after they land, they manage to wreck their radio -- their only contact with ops.  As a result, they remain stranded for over three years, completely oblivious to the larger political developments that split Italy in two after the Allied invasion.  The soldiers find the local culture welcoming and surprisingly similar to their own: ""mia faccia, mia razza"" (one/my race, one/my face), as the Orthodox priest tells them -- and as a result, they quickly go native. In the process, a number of Mediterranean stereotypes are exposed and explored.  I love this little film, and have used it in an anthropology class ""Peoples and cultures of the Mediterranean"" for over 15 years.  The students enjoy the plot, at the same time they see varous representations of Mediterranean peoples enacted in a way they can analyze and critique.  The film is also a political commentary on the state of Italy in the early 1990s, and the failed promise of both the Repubic and the ideals of 1968. Highly recommended -- even if all you want is a little entertainment.",1362182400,2,1414,4.866666666666666

492024,5,630267672X,This is a time honored movie.  It does have English subtitles but the story flows through dealing with that with no trouble.  And things like this do happen.  Stories of Japanese still in caves on remote islands of the South Pacific twenty years after the war use to make headlines.  So this is about Italians in the Mediterranean.  So much the better~!

It's the story of a group of Italian soldiers stranded on a peaceful Greek island, in the middle of WW II.

492079,4,630267672X,"When I saw that Silvio Berlusconi was involved in the making of this movie, I expected brashness. Instead, this movie was a gentle tale of the Italian passion for life, love and women. Even in the midst of war, this capacity for warmth spreads its glow and draws the viewer into a delightful walk through the Italian soul in all its guises: from the macho sergeant (who wants to dominate in everything from the soccer field to the appointments with the local prostitute) to the educated and artistic Lieutenant (who would rather paint than fight) and from the virgin who finds his One True Love in the only prostitute on the lost Mediterranean island to the peasant soldier who loves his donkey Silvana with an equal passion, we ourselves come to love these crazy, quirky romantic men and all they represent.

Despite its wryly comic twists, which often had us laughing out loud, the slow meandering style lends an affable allure to the movie and the tender, poignant end was perfect.

English sub-titles were good. The acting was excellent and the directing captured the hazy, lazy atmosphere of an island idyll in an ironic subtext because, of course, the rest of the world was at war.

The Oscar this movie won was well-deserved!",1302393600,4,1232,4.774647887323944

This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and will certainly be viewed at least three times.  It is truly a hilarious gut-buster.  One caveat:  this is a movie for adult audiences, so send the kiddies to their rooms.  But if they are young and don't read sub-titles, it shouldn't be a problem.

492084,4,630267672X,"This was a pretty solid comedy-drama about a group of Italian soldiers who spent World War II on a Greek Island. That doesn't sound too exciting, but it's interesting and there are some very funny lines in the film.

Like many of the European films I own, it features good storytelling and interesting characters although most of the men in here are just stupid, or simply a different mindset than what we have over here.  I have found this with many Italian or French films. It's almost like a totally different culutre than what I'm used to here in the U.S. and Canada.

The female lead, Vanna Barba, looks terrific as does the camera-work in general on this film. I didn't see a ""rating"" on my VHS box but I would rate it an ""R"" for usages of the f-word and some brief nudity. Any film that looks this good on VHS should be seen on DVD, which I look forward to doing, especially if it ever comes out on Blu-Ray.",1237852800,2,914,4.333333333333333
492085,5,630267672X,"This is a best-loved favorite. There is humor and beauty in a band of Italian eccentrics who happen to form a small WWII battalion sent to stand sentry on a Greek, Mediterranean island. They never see a real wartime enemy, never fire a wartime shot and are never able to communicate with their Italian commanders. What individuals do in sometimes hilarious, well-woven episodes, instead, is make friends with the occupants, fall in love with a native prostitue, fall in love with a donkey, paint frescos in a church, get stoned on marijuana, try to escape, hide to avoid leaving and so forth. They end up missing the entire war but finding a paradise that resounds in their souls -- and yours. This movie grows on you so much that you want to avoid leaving, too.

492088,5,630267672X,"This wonderful Italian film shot during the 1990's, tells the story of a group of misfit Italian soldiers from various parts of Italy sent to occupy a Greek Island during World War II of zero strategic importance.

Through a series of mishaps, they lose a soldier's beloved pet donkey, and their essential two-way radio, effectively cutting them off and leaving them forgotten during the war.

  I go back to this movie again and again and again.  It's enchanting, moving, and carries within it an eternal sense of humanity and what all our lives are about- trials, tribulations, free-spirited joy, and most importantly the feeling that we have learned and continue to learn throughout it all what living and being human is all about.
  it's simple, wonderful, and definitely full of the Italian passion for life, lived to its fullest whatever the circumstances.
  So Amazon reviewer, I challenge you to watch this movie once a year for the rest of your years and to see how well it stands the test of time.  I guarantee you it will and each new viewing will bring more enjoyment and appreciation than the last.  enjoy!",1189296000,8,861,4.562091503267974
492102,5,630267672X,"This film story is culturally valuable because of the ways in which it contradicts itself. The film's credits say that it is, ""Dedicated to all those who are running away."" A line of dialogue reinforces this idea. Lorusso says, ""In times like these, escape is the only way. To live and keep dreaming."" And yet at the end of the film, Antonio, Lorusso and the Sergeant are all together again on the Greek island that they had wanted to escape so badly at the story's start. They escaped the war by accident. They escaped the reality of their desertion periodically with drugs, sex and games. But the film asserts that once a person allows a culture, a place, or a people to move them, there is no escaping it. Once a person finds beauty within a situation and makes a home out of it, the good feelings and ideals created in that context are forever within them.  When Lorusso returns to the island many years after, he says of Italy, ""They didn't let us change anything."" His life on the island had given him an ideal for a compassionate existence, where people can grow and change, and when he didn't feel capable of achieving that in war-torn Italy, he ""escaped"" once again to the island where he had been happy.

 The beauty of this story shines through because of its immense craftsmanship. The story would not have been so moving had the compassionate existence not been created by unlikely people in an unlikely place. The soldiers, the Sergeant admits early on, are a ""platoon of misfits"": a Bacchus-like Russian, a frequent deserter who wants to get back to his pregnant wife, a pair of goat-herding brothers from the mountains, a weak and feminine but ever-loyal Antonio, a man in love with Lorusso, and a man in love with his donkey. They are anything but soldierly, and their nationalistic feelings, if they ever had any, quickly wane. ""I feel abandoned,"" one of the men comments. Lorusso says, ""They left us here and here we'll stay."" Staying on the island, early in the story, doesn't seem a very welcome proposition since ""Greece is the Tomb of Italians"" is written on the wall of the town. But the audience learns, as the characters do, that the townspeople are not only harmless but welcoming and warm. Beautiful cinematography and music ease the audience into a comfortable life on the Greek island along with the soldiers; their senses are our senses, their feelings our feelings, because the elements of film are so carefully crafted. The Sergeant's statement about the ""poets, philosophers, warriors, and goddesses"" from which they are all descended sets the tone for the film. Antonio recognizes the poet within himself, Vasilissa the goddess. The Sergeant is clearly a philosopher and Lorusso learns to project his warrior-like tendencies towards compassionate means, such as protecting his friends. The story, by allowing us to feel and witness such growth within such ordinarily quirky and believable characters, suggests that such a compassionate existence is available for everyone. The film is dedicated to the audience, who is allowed to escape within its beauty for a while, and come out knowing a little better what human compassion is capable of.",1178323200,8,3176,4.866913123844732
492103,5,630267672X,"""Mediterraneo"" is a FUN movie.  It's a very likeable story of a group of Italian marines who follow an assignment to occupy an obscure Greek Aegean island during the early period of WWII.  Due to a series of escapades, they lose their contact with the outside world.  Instead, they get caught up in their own little world for the next three years.  That may sound like a boring movie but things happen from time to time and the excerpts we see are generally pretty funny.  The different personalities emerge and their variety allows the writer and the actors plenty of room for development.  In the end, the marines are ""rescued"" by their new allies; the British.  Initially, all of the soldiers were focussed on getting out of this forsaken island.  In the end, the island had become their home and their ""rescue"" was a mixed blessing.  A post script ending brings the feeling together in a poignant way.

The acting is very good although all of the actors and actresses were new to me.  I especially appreciated the character who played Sargeant Lo Russo.  The cinematography is excellent which helped to give the viewer a sense of paradise for these errant marines.  I found the movie to be a relaxing, humorous, touching experience.  I got used to the Italian with English subtitles with no problem and even got to where I could follow some of the dialogue without looking at the subtitles.  The movie won an Oscar, I believe, for Best Foreign Language film.  I've used that category to find a number of very good to excellent films that I probably would have never seen.  ""Mediterraneo"" was a fun example of what I mean by that.",1147046400,5,1633,4.653846153846154

492106,5,630267672X,"Definitely a GREAT movie, Mediterraneo, brings to the screen the story of a small Italian military force consisting of eight men that invades Greece during WWII and takes over one of the islands.  Subsequently, the Italians are forced to interact with the local Greek populace with everything that that entails.  When the Germans arrive, things get a bit more complicated...
Mediterraneo, is a film that touches on human relations, and such concepts as hope, honor and inner strength.
Needless to say, all the actors have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least; without exceptions, they give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.
The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor (!!!), and the music are all WONDERFUL!
In short, Mediterraneo is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!
Strongly recommended along with Malena for the lovers of such films.",1108425600,9,1374,4.986899563318778

492108,5,630267672X,"Every movie, like life itself, has a beginning and an ending. Comparing the beginning and the ending tells a lot about a movie. The opening picture in Mediterraneo shows a group of people, with little and common, shuffled together by fate. The ending shows a group of friends, who have learnt to share their lives.
It is 1941, and a fierce battle is raging through the eastern part of the Mediterranean, where Italian troops are battling British forces for the control of Islands, such as it happened in similar ways between American troops and the Japanese in the Pacific theatre.
On this background, an Italian platoon is sent to the tiny island of Kastellorizo, the southernmost island of the Dodekanesos, huddled against the Turkish coastline.  The cruiser, that brought them to the Island, is sunk the same day, and their radio equipment fails. The soldiers gradually make contact with the Islanders.  As the war progresses the soldiers and their little island are forgotten by the war-faring parties.
Step-by-step they find new lives. Some become goat herders, fishermen, while others fall in love with the village prostitute. The commanding lieutenant discovers his talent for fresco painting, and restores the island's church, whilst his eleven members of the platoon serve as models for the followers of Jesus and other saints.
In this movie, the soldiers collectively forget about their identity, and become part of the islander community.  However, as the war ends, the island's male abducted population returns to reclaim their wives.
Reluctantly, the Italians leave the island. Only one of them hides in a barrel, after having married the village's prostitute.
This movie is not only highly entertaining. It plays in a rarely portrayed theatre of the WWII.
It portrays the development of human society in the context of compassion and friendship.
I highly recommend this movie to spectators interested in psychology, the absurdity of life, and human development.

I watched it in Italian with English subtitles and not understanding Italian was, in a way, a bonus. It made me more attentive to the music and the expressive tone of the soldiers' screams, grumbling, and delirium. We often watch movies that depict the difficulty of people from one culture to adapt to the environment and get a long with people of another culture. In Mediterraneo, it's the opposite. The Italian soldiers adapted so well and easily to the island and its people. Of course the Mediterranean factor helped, but it's the human factor after all, that bonds people together.",1081555200,5,676,4.93859649122807

492167,5,630267672X,"Mediterraneo is an excellent title for this film, for I truly think it exposes the mediterranean character and as a very mediterranean person myself I identified fully with the lack of organization, improvisation and genral unwillingness to follow, or modify, orders that the group of Italian  soldiers display as they invade the island.  In truth several abandoned and semi-abanodened Greek islands weer 'colonized' by the Italian army in WWII and just like the soldiers in the film, many had no idea what was going on in the rest of the war. The film is therefore very good from this standpoint.  However, it's also good at showing the affinity that Mediterraneans share and the ease with which the Italians adapt to the island, even becoming reluctant to elave when the time comes.  Then agian, many leave to go to Italy in search of opportunities, the chance to re-build a better Italy after the tragedy of fascism and Mussolini. if the film had stopped here it would have been very good; however, there's more, and perhaps only those very familair with Italian politics in the early 90's could have captured the subtle criticism.  Indeed, the film is really an indictement of the modern era.  The film was made when Italy was deep into an investigation that uncovered several layers of corruption at the governmental and high business level.  The investigation was known as Mani Pulite - Clean Hands - and its outcome was a shake-up of the old parties and oled politicians, or so it seemed.  The film then shos that nothing had really changed since Mussolini, the great nation that was supposed to be did not arise and the prospects for improvement were no better.  The main characters meet again in fact on the island in the present as they escaped the relaity of Italy once more.  Despite this obvious self-criticism I also think the film shows some of the more positive aspects of Italys' non-greatness.  the fact that it can laugh at itself and the subtle defiance of authority that preserves and respects individuality, not to mention the sense of humor that can develop into a people in such circumstances.

The first ten minutes of  Mediterraneo seem like a photograhped play, complete with oddball character  going head to head with each other in small, darkly lit sets. It is only  when these characters meet the locals that the film blossoms into a sunny,  lyrical  and strangely uplifiting experience.
  Most reviews have  described it as a comedy, since Mediterraneo offers us a soldier who goes  to war with a donkey called Silvana, an artistic battalion leader who would  rather paint a cathedral then display any kind of leadership and a  loud  sargent trying to hypnotise his fellow soldiers in a soccer game, I would  agree that it is a very funny film. But its more then that. With the help  of cinematographer Italo Petriccione, director Salvatores's film is like a  whimisical dream, a rose tinted memory. He seems aware that the virginal  romantic soldier and the prostitute with a heart of gold are cliches, but  in context of this picturesque little poem their romance made me  inexplicably and ridiculously happy.
  There is something enormously  endearing about the Italian language. Maybe its the way the words stretch  out, ""Medeeteryaano"", that makes it seem so passionate. My  Italian is about as good as Roberto Benigni's English, but listening to the  language spoken by its native speakers is always a pleasure. It just seems  less cynical.
  The film made me believe that these men could forget  themselves for three years in the spiritual and sensual paradise they were  sent to conquer. Underscored with some incredibly beautiful bazouki music,  Mediterraneo possesses a giddy indescribable charm.",965260800,43,1795,5.103806228373703
