4499667,4,B004YHN15Q,"Shor in the City takes place in Mumbai with the Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations forming the backdrop of the celebrations. Over a period of 11 days, a number of characters undergo a sea change.
1. A conterfieit book seller  Tushaar Kapoor) who has suddenly discovered the joys of books and finds a new meaning in his life but life takes a different turn when he lands n trouble.
2. Sendhil Ramamurthy  The doc from the series Heroes) has returned to India from the USA and is thinking of starting a new business but is incessantly hounded, with his plans and life threatened by the mafia who seek protection money.
3. Savan  Sundeep Kishen) who dreams of playing cricket for India but finds resistance at the selection panel, who are keen on him paying a bribe.

Three individuals and their stories form the film but their lives do not interwine and they never meet. Shor in the City refers to the city and the many cries of help from its many inhabitants. The film is well written and the characters are lively and interesting with full of quirks, including ethical dilemma's whether it is the ethical bookseller, or the NRI who is trying to escape his dark past, the cricket player who finds peace even though his plans are evaporating.
Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K. are fine directors and they keep the pace lively, they had earlier directed the watchable `99' but they have excelled themselves in this film. Tushaar Kapoor and his screen wife Radhika Apte are fabulous. Sendhil Ramamurthy could use some acting chops but is still ok. Nilesh Dwiwedi is great. The music is fine, but boasts in my opinion one of the finest songs of the year `Saibo'
On the whole, Shor in the City is a above average watch about four different individuals finding their way in the teeming city of Mumbai. Underground cinema is getting more interesting with each passing film and some of the best films this year have been small films. Four stars 9/27/2011",1319241600,,1936,4.685294117647059
