7960689,5,B0000648ZE,"This is one of the best animes I have ever seen. It is suitable for all ages and the story can be enjoyed by all ages. The music was incredible. The dubbing was pretty good. It even came with free stickers. There was no Japanese dub, but I didn't want that anyway.",1385164800,,264,4.096153846153846
7960690,4,B0000648ZE,"Bit Cloud is a wandering junk parts dealer. He collects parts to build the ultimate Zoid partner. One day he meets a group of Zoid warriors and a Zoid called Liger Zero. He joins their team and begins to fight with them in organized Zoid competitions. Even though these competitions are a friendly sport, there are dubious people that use Zoids to gain power and strike fear into others. Bit, Liger Zero, and his teammates are on the front lines of that battle.

This is a pretty good series. It's nowhere near as good as Zoids Chaotic Century, but it's a lot of sun and very entertaining. There are some very compelling characters and awesome battle scenes. The animation, and voice acting are a bit better than average. You should recognize Bit Cloud's voice actor as Richard Cox, the same guy that played Inuyasha. The story is a little weak and not very deep, but it's okay. The series is fun and is definitely worth watching. As I mentioned before, Chaotic Century is way better. The problem is that it's out of print and very rare. You could easily spend over $700 on the complete series. I suggest checking this one out first. If you like this series and don't mind opening your wallet, Chaotic Century will provide more enjoyment than this spinoff.",1354838400,,1256,4.632286995515695

7960692,5,B0000648ZE,"These episodes are great! As you can see the 2 zoids(ligerzero and lighting saix)which the episode is featured. Vol. 2 features the(main)episode The High Speed Battle:Transforming in zero Jager. In this episode Harry Champ hiers Jack Cisco to help him beat the Blitz team. Of course Harry was a lucky guy to win Jack's game(which is drawing the card and guessing which suit it is).Harry's team lost thanks to the Ligerzero Jager. Also in this episode Bit finds out about the new parts for his Liger. Also you have the episodes The Dark Gaint:invincible Elephander which Leena's zoid is totaled,The Desert Gang:the Hover Cargo's in Danger which Leena gets a Gun Sniper and attacked by the Sand Stingray Gang,and Invasion of The Fierce Tigers:Tranform to Zero Schnider which in this episode the Zabers meet their savior and get the strom unit. Your pretty lucky if you get this since you see the first episodes in which the Liger tranforms. The only thing you don't see is tranfroming into Panzer. Believe me, you should get this amazing,exceting,funny and just cool Vol.",1023926400,2,1069,4.944444444444445
