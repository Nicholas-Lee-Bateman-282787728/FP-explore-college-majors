There is as usual the archetypical good vs. evil but the lessons in teamwork, cooperation, and tolerance are all wrapped up in this one movie and very well presented.",1464566400,,389,4.27027027027027

Maybe it's not the best movie for adults, but it's pretty decent for a kids movie. There's comedy, adventure, and romance. These three elements can keep your kid's eyes glued on the TV.

156760,2,0792839420,"The title pretty much says it all for this inferior direct-to-video sequel to the now legendary animated classic from Don Bluth. Eric Idle's performance and musical number is a high point (only marginally), but SECRET OF NIMH 2 is obviously no match for its predecessor, which features disappointingly choppy animation and a story that is better suited to an average Saturday morning kids' cartoon. In other words, the whole tone of the movie plays out like one. Really embarrassing considering that the original had a more realistic, gritty edge to it.  NIMH itself, for instance, is portrayed in this sequel as a Dr. Frankenstein sort of castle with a mad scientist as opposed to a facility of scientists oblivious to the cruelties they inflict on animals.  Even the music is second-rate; apparently the filmmakers wanted to steal Disney's formula, as evidenced from the uninspired songs.  The original NIMH had a far better and more inspiring score, courtesy of the late Jerry Goldsmith.  Other elements of ripoff:  the overeager hero, comic sidekicks, and the inclusion of a love interest. But none of these ingredients mesh into a tale with any of the depth, drama, or magic of far better animated features.  Alas, such is the case with so many of these direct-to-video sequels. As a matter of fact, you can just skip it and not miss much at all.",1431475200,2,1351,4.9035087719298245

O'Brien's daughter, Jane Leslie Conly.  Racso and the Rats of NIMH and R.T., Margaret and the Rats of NIMH.  They are both excellent.  And by the way, the mouse family's last name is FRISBY not BRISBY!!!  No idea why they thought they had to change that.

156791,4,0792839420,"I watched and enjoyed this movie when I was an elementary school child. I saw it on Toon Disney and I really loved watching it. I don't enjoy it as much now, but I still have a few feelings left for this movie. I was a little disappointed to hear that critics and fans hated this movie. I actually watched this BEFORE I fully understood the first film. I liked the hero story, and more importantly, what I still enjoy Timmy and Jenny's relationship.  That's my highlight for the film. I am grateful that this was not scary like the first film, especially with the cats. Dragon was menacing, but the cats in this film are funny. My only problems with this film are the faded animation, and the fact that there is no real villain. I still enjoy the first film, but I don't think this sequel is horrible. I definitely liked it better than the Disney direct- to- video sequels. There is a good movie in here, I know there is. If we just come up with a bigger story with Timmy and Jenny in it and include a real villain, we could get a sequel as brilliant as the first film.",1380153600,3,1069,4.240196078431373
156792,1,0792839420,"Hand drawn sequels almost always get the short end of the stick. True classics that receive sequels are generally a big sign of trouble. They are usually poorly written, and you see a sort of attempt to follow the formula. But this? This movie does not do any sort of a good job doing that, in fact makes an effort to run in its own direction. The first movie was dark and enchanting. I would even say very serious, to an extent of course. But this movie not only pukes rainbows all over it and very randomly brings back characters, but decides songs were missing....you just can't do something like that for something that didn't have it in the first place...after 2 songs, I couldn't finish. The animation was worse that what is seen on old saturday mornings. Please avoid, and pretend the first never had a sequel.",1327276800,2,817,4.527027027027027

156795,1,0792839420,What the hell was MGM thinking making a NIMH sequel without Don Bluth? Why couldn't they wait until Bluth was finished with Anastasia? Turn the original NIMH movie into a musical? Gimme a break! What would happen if Don Bluth made NIMH 2 his way for a change?,1301443200,2,259,4.416666666666667
156796,1,0792839420,"I saw this on Youtube before watching the genius that was the first Secret of NIHM and holly s***! This is far, far from being anything like the first. For one this isn't made by Don Bluth, but a different company called Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Animation who are known for All Dogs Go To Heaven 2 (I loved this movie) and some movies I never heard of which is probably a good thing. This movie took the name of the first movie and raped it. Shoot it shouldn't even bare the name Secret of NIHM.

 You know somethings wrong as soon as you see the title. It gives a brief summary of the first film as told by Nicodemus prophesizing that one of the Brisby children is to save thorn Valley from NIHM. then the epic Secret of NIHM title is shown, but that epicness is quickly blown out the window as TIMMY TO THE RESCUE appears at the bottomXD So out of place. Instead of making a gritty, but artistic styled movie like the first, they went with stupid, cute, and just plain ridiculus. It just destroys what the first movie was all about. The editing is complete crap. Theres actually a person on Youtube (ThePS2God) who counted how many times they crossfade throughout the entire movie. Thier just so damn annoying. The characters from the previous movie don't even look the same. The design for the Brisby children are hideous. they even recycle characters. In the first musical number there are some characters in the scene that we're not even supposed to know about until later on! Thier not even supposed to be in the same area! Jeremy isn't enough to save this movie. The Great OWl is mentioned, but nowhere in the movie. If you do watch you'll see what replaces the Great OwlXD

 You want to know what else? Mrs. Brisby is barely seen in the f-ing movie! Instead our main protagonist now is Timmy. You remember Timmy? He was the little mouse who was sick in the last movie. They came up with some BS story about how hes destined to be a hero like his father who saved the Rats in the previous movie from NIHM. If the cliche plot isn't enough they turned it into a f***ing musical!! AHHHHH!!! Prepare to be earraped everybody. The songs with the exception of maybe the one sung by timmy are horrible. Also notice in Timmys song how the first kids singing sound aweful than in the next scene the voice actor change. That tells me they knew the kids singing sucked big time. Theres also a Big Lipped Aligator Moment later on when this pointless Caterpillar thing sings this terrible musical number. It had no other purpose than to make this shi-ite longer than it has to be.

 The dialogue is also horrendous. At the beginning when Timmys scolded by a certain old Mouse who shouldn't even be alive at this point in time quates ""That its ok for guys to wear the same underwear 3 days in a row"". WTF did that come from. Theres alot of jokes in this movie that just fall flat on thier a**. Don't even get me started on the rest of the horrible dialogue. Timmy says alot of stupid things in this movie and do as many stupid things.

 To put the icing on cake in one musical scene near the end of the movie where Timmy and the pointless female mouse do a duet together, it rips off a certain Don bluth film about a another young mouse who duets with female mouse (coughAmericanTalecough). They don't even hide the fact that its a rip off. It even does the split screen bit that this particular movie does. They try to be depressing with this painfully 3 minute scene, but fail completely>.<

 There are many more problems I have with this movie, but if i named them all this review will be a novel. After watching this i see why fans of the original pretend this doesn't exist. ITs almost up there with the 3 infamous animated Titanic movies. Hell I didn't even know it existed until the internet. If you don't want to be traumatized, Innorance is bliss. If you're curious enough to watch this save your money and just go watch it on Youtube for free.",1285113600,15,3941,4.408528198074277
156797,4,0792839420,"I found this movie to be entertaining in some ways and kind of silly in others. The animation is some what unreal and gives the apearance of the characters being stiff. If you've ever read the book be prepared for a major disappointment. It is in no way anything like the book or even the first movie;they seemed to try and make it scarry but the parts that are  supposed to be scarry end up being either down right silly or totally unbelievable. Jeremy is still his goofy self however, and is the funniest part of the movie. Justin,Brutus and Mr. Ages seem to have lost their adventure but are still enjoyable. I particularly liked the part where Timmy goes back for his brother even though it may cost him his life. The music in this movie is good, there is no swearing, and it has a good story.

156821,1,0792839420,"OMG, what happened to the story?! Okay, if it would have followed the example of the FIRST movie, it may have been acceptable, but this was just...sucky.

For one, why did it need a bunch of crappy songs? Why does everything animated have to be a stupid sing-a-long now? Why can't we just have movies without the characters breaking out into song?

I'm sorry, though there were interesting parts in the movie, overall, it was just crappy. It is probably fine for little kids, but for someone who actually grew up enjoying the first movie, this is a pretty big yuck.",1228867200,9,565,4.584158415841584

Don Bluth's original NIMH is (deservedly) an animation classic that doesn't underestimate the audience's intelligence and isn't afraid to engage a deeper sense of worldly honesty that most animated features won't touch with a ten foot pole.

The best that can be said for ""Timmy To The Rescue"" is... well... actually, nothing.

Everything about this shameful excuse of a sequel screams ""lowest common denominator"" which can be verified by the few positive reviews listed in here. MGM should be slapped (hard) for contributing to the dumbing down of the masses by pereptuating such inane, anemic garbage like this. Sadly, thanks to the WalMart inspired ""git'r dun"" dummified mentality of the poor souls who flock to and support such substandard drivel, those of us seeking intelligent and thought provoking entertaiment have to dig deeper.

Part of this reminds of  redwall. There is a battle near the end against Timmoy and his brother Martin who has gone mad  due to experience due to be alter after he  was captured by the scientist.
He plans to conquer thorn Valley but timmoy stops him returns him to good.  Some cheesy parts it is a  musical.  That there is a cheesy scence where Jermy pretends to be the great owl. Cons the wodland creatures of there  of golden coins.
Some new characters are sela a capterilar and a real pretty female.
Recomend for children 5 and older.  Not as intense as the original but still has some scary part.  Like at the end when Nimth catch on fire and two cats  chase timmoy.
Unfortunatley Jon Debluso who played the voice of the crow Jermy in this a and the original died shorrtly after the Second secret of Nimh was complete.
Timmy is the main character and you barley see his mother in this one.  Pluse some of the characters have changed. Brutus the rat in the first one who almost  squabobds Miss Frissby is a softy in this one.  Justin and Mr. Ages return.  I find the song good.  I rented this  a couple of years ago from blockbuster.
I plan on Buy this and the original after I move out of my house.  For my sister are very picky about what I watch.  Okey would have been better if It had been more intense like the first one.  This was the last movie made in the series.  All the people who reviewed it but gave it only star.  I think some  of these people are  to picky. Coome on Eight Leged Freaks was on of the best monster movies I have ever seen the stink  critic only gave it 2.

156841,1,0792839420,"words cannot describe how much i loathe this film. its a major dissapointment compared to the first one.
i really think the writers of this thought the origianl was 'too dark and scary' for the kids today. excuse me! how old were
biggest part of you Nimh 1 lovers when you first watched the first film, i was atleast 5!
the characters break out into song every 5 minutes into the film *hiss*
this is not a sequal, its more of a 'what if' story.
the rats are stealing! the reason they went to thorn valley was so they could stop that. evil martins song was majorly dissapointing, when i first watched it and realised martin was the baddy not to mention there was song's in it, i was thinking 'ho maybe it won't be all that bad, the villains songs are mostly really great' i certainly got that wrong, it is so pathetic compared to Rasputins song from Anastasia, now i know theres some out there that may dislike that (i dunno how Don Bluth was part of that creation too). but that is one of my favourite songs.
okay sorry but people who think the first one was boring because timothy was sick well 'oh dear what a crying shame, its the end of the world' sure but he was suffering from a real illness but as it was said in the film you can die from it. Jim henson died from it for crying out loud. BUT sickness can be treated and can be recovered from. experimentation is worse. if they were abit more realistic martin could have ended up with an ear on his back, i had that idea and would have loved to see that. XD. and that really happened to a real mouse, so nobody moan at me for saying thats not real.
anyway i was so very dissapointed in this film as you can obviously tell. so.. im going to work on my own sequal.

156843,5,0792839420,"""The Secret of NIMH"" told a self-contained story (and an epic one, at that), but a few loose ends were left to tantalize the imagination.
Part II picks up the threads of that tale, and weaves an equally stirring saga, while adding a few shocking plot twists and rousing musical numbers for good measure.
In the tradition of one of my favorite plot devices, we learn that young Timothy Brisby has an important destiny to fulfill--he is a ""chosen one,"" if you will. He journeys to the Rats' new home, Thorn Valley. After seeing the first film, I always wondered what sort of utopian society the Rats would be able to create, liberated from the need to hide in a farmhouse rosebush, and ""NIMH 2"" delivers a greater spectacle than I could have conceived.
In the wondrous splendor of Thorn Valley, he meets (for the first time) his old benefactors Justin and Mr. Ages. Brutus the Guard also makes a welcome appearance, and finally speaks! Providing much more characterization than his appearance in the first film, ""NIMH 2"" made Brutus one of my favorite animated characters ever.
New characters are added, including Jenny the Mouse and Cecil the Bug.
A few surprises pop up along the way. I don't want to spoil anything, but remember the mice who got sucked into the ventilation system while attempting to escape from NIMH? Well, not ALL of them were killed...
But the most gut-wrenching shock of all is the revelation that Timothy's brother Martin has turned to the ""dark side.""
All-star talent contributes to the journey, with Ralph Macchio and Eric Idle (who continues his tradition of lending his voice talents to awesome animated sagas) providing depth and feeling to the charming characters. Best of all, Dom DeLuise returns as Jeremy the Crow!!!
The animation is quite artful, for a movie that went direct-to-video. It's absolutely on par with Disney's video sequels. It looks even better on DVD.
Not only is ""the Secret of NIMH 2"" a satisfying sequel in its own right, but it also leaves a small thread to be picked up by a third film. The mystical amulet that saved the Brisby home is never mentioned. Perhaps it's gone missing...",1036972800,7,2135,4.772972972972973

For all you fans out there looking to capture some of the magic from that first movie ....STOP!!! STOP NOW!!! Don't go here.... Don't rent this.... Don't think about this movie..... I promise disappointment......
On the flip side....
If you have kids...young ones.....who haven't seen the first movie at all.... This could be a renter...... Maybe a bargain bin type purchase.... Or maybe a gift from a well meaning grandparent...... I stress young kids...
Note:
I so rarely don't finish a film, but this one was shut off mid viewing. It just couldn't hold anyones interest.
The only reason it gets a two star rating is because the movie was entertaining enough to keep 3 out of 10 kids from running amuck during my friends babysitting job.",1016150400,10,828,4.7972027972027975
156846,3,0792839420,"This is not the worst sequel for a non-Disney movie i've seen ('Swan Princess 2' and 'An American Tail III & IV is much worser!), the art direction is pretty, the two leading characters are both sweet and brave, there is a lot of action, but the pro is:Cheap songs, bad character animation, some missing characters, and a confusing story.
If you love classic animated non-Disney movies from the 90's, you will with guarantee love 'Secret Of NIMH 2'.",1008720000,2,449,4.69620253164557

Ignore shills and five-year-olds who give this movie the highest possible rating. It will cause internal bleeding with its sheer stupidity. There are no elements of the book in this movie. There are no elements of the original movie in this movie. I suspect the whole thing was a fevered dream swirling in the brain of gravely ill Timothy.

156868,1,0792839420,"Robert C. O'Brien would be deeply offended at such a disgusting piece of garbage. He's probably turning in his grave right now. As for Don Bluth, he probably cried when he saw it, as it trashed his legacy for the next  generation. As a serious Secret of NIMH enthusiast, I find the film to be a  gross manifestation of the phrase ""You killed it."" I watch the  fisrt movie on DVD at home, praying that children who are at the age I was  when i was first touched by the film aren't watching this cheap trash. How  can an animated film be this bad, you ask? Read the books, Watch the first  movie, and you will be as appalled as I am. What was MGM thinking? Is this  how they repay the greatest feat of animation their sorry corporation has  ever witnessed? By trashing it? Uh uh. I think MGM owes the NIMH community,  the children whose ideas of film they just warped, and most of all, Don  Bluth, a BIG apology...  Nevermind the Amazon rating, I give it negative 5  stars, if that.",948326400,48,980,4.266304347826087

This sequel, not only was it completely off the story of the first movie, but Timmy was just the sick little mouse in the first one.

156870,1,0792839420,"It took MGM 16 years to make a sequel to ""The Secret of NIMH"", so it's really sad they ended with this bad movie. From cheap computer generated animation, a dull plot and lots of annoying songs, it's more like  a Saturday morning cartoon than a full blown animated movie. Very young  kids can enjoy it, but has a serious animation fan I sincerely advice you  to better expend your money buying the original ""The Secret of  NIMH"" instead. It's a much better movie, based in an award-winner book  by Robert C. O'Brien, directed by the magnificent Don Bluth and with a  terrific music score by Jerry Goldsmith.",929059200,5,607,4.574074074074074

7792638,1,0792839420,"Having read the Rats of NIMH, and enjoyed the 80's animated feature ""Secret of NIMH"", I was expecting something to harken back to childhood nostalgia. Sadly this fell short of my expectations.

The box art looked a little weird, but I was willing to overlook it... Until I actually saw the film. The animation is nowhere near the quality if the original. The acting is iffy. The plot is contrived, and for some reason its a musical? Honestly it played like a self insert fan fiction with too many plot holes and new characters to make any sense.

On top of this its a bad quality DVD. It played skip free, sure, but the menu screen was garish and hard to read and navigate, with random capitalizations and colors that either clashed or were too close to each other to be read. The sound quality was terrible-- I'm hard of hearing, so I thought it was just me, but no one else could understand a word being said either-- and while it came in English, French and Spanish, as far as what you could listen to, it only had French and Spanish subtitles. Definitely not an accessible film.

Honestly this film was an incredible let down and the only good thing about it was the fact that Dom Delouise reprised his role from the 80's film, even if it was more like Jeremy with a touch of the Gator from All Dogs Go To Heaven.

I regret spending my money on this, honestly.",1466467200,3,1364,4.379446640316205
