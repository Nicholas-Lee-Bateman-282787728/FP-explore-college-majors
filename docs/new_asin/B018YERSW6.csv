7559667,1,B018YERSW6,"Have to completely disagree.  The acting is dreadful, and the budget is almost non existent.  Far better adult films available from Europe some even have real plots.",1460592000,2,165,5.074074074074074

7559669,5,B018YERSW6,"Vinegar Syndrome does another great job remastering a vintage/classic 35mm adult film

Star Virgin looks really good scanned and restored in 2k from the 35mm vault elements

ADULT XXX EROTICA!Kari Klark stars in one of her most provocative roles to-date. This newfound beauty explodes across the screen, along with seven lusty lovelies from the pages of Hustler and Chic, as they indulge their desires with universal delight and eroticism.

The out of print laserdisc was the best PQ version of this classic film up until now
the previous dvd put out by VCX on May 2003  was a straight up VHS to dvd transfer
This is the best home video version to date
It very much like To Naughty to say No this dvd looks gorgeous
If you play it in a blu ray player upconverted it could easily pass for a blu ray (it's very close)
The film is also presented in the original 1.85:1 Widescreen format
along with a new/exclusive Audio commentary with Director/Producer Howard Ziehm

Is this release for everyone??
Without a doubt no if you are under 20 and desensitized to sex you'll find it ""lame"" or weak
But, this was during the ""Golden"" era of the adult entertainment industry where there was budgets, and stories
It was very much alternative art you had real legit stars and talented producers/directors
Now in 2016 any smock with a iPhone can film anything
It's just very cool a rogue distribution house like Vinegar Syndrome is taking the time to scan and restore these films
Both Hustler and Vivid need to follow suit
These films are just as important as Taxi Driver, Dawn of the Dead, Foxy Brown, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Apocalypse Now, Animal House and so on  and need to be restored and respected  9.5/10
The only major negative would be the DVD case itself (it's a plain black case) would've looked better in a clear plastic case",1454889600,34,1824,4.68125

7559675,5,B018YERSW6,"Girls who can convincingly act the part of empty-headed nymphomaniac bimbos and look eye wateringly hot in ridiculously skimpy 'space' costumes are rare. Rare too are movie makers who understand the how to shoot scenes that show the girls off at their best. Fortunately Howard Ziehm (AKA Linus Gator) assembled these elements and knows how to make a porn movie the way I love them. The girls are gorgeous and sex crazed in a typically 70's way where mindless fun is the underlying theme rather than the modern genre where it's often either pretentious or robotic.

Kari Klark plays the Star Virgin in her barely there shiny space cadet outfit and her role is really just to provide link-up sequences between otherwise unrelated mini porn stories. These scenes are worth the money in themselves, but Kari's performance as the dumb, clueless bimbo perfectly conveys pure sexuality as entertainment. The camera angles, the costumes, the deliberately corny storylines and dialog just make this a delight. I must make special mention of the cheerleader costumes and routines in the Starbuck vignette. They are proper 'porn movie' grade cheerleader outfits with far more teasing flesh on display than genuine ones ever allow. Ziehm must share my obsession with cheerleaders as they also feature prominently in 'Flesh Gordon and the Cosmic Cheerleaders'. If skimpy costumes are your thing, do yourself a favor.

Vinegar Syndrome's restoration on this is excellent and I'm grateful they've managed to save this classic movie.",1465344000,19,1517,5.187755102040816

8743344,4,B018YERSW6,"This is one enjoyable and well-put-together film, and very titillating over the entire spectrum of ""funny-porn-films"", the camp lines, precious facial expressions, incredible body contortions and poses. But alas, all this will go, not only unappreciated, but decried and maligned if the viewer is one of those persons descended of the Pilgrim passenger list of the Mayflower.
Be that as it may, there are plenty of us who can thoroughly enjoy Star Virgin and have the intelligence to understand this is an erotically oriented satire of a porn film.  As my dad said, ""No one can afford to take himself too seriously.""  and this film does precisely that. Sit back and enjoy Kari Klark and the rest of this stunning cast.
