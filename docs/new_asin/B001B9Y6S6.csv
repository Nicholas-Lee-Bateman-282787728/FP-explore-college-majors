There is nothing flashy here, only quick and simple movements - the ones that work to get the job done and you home safe.  Examples are shown in real time and in slow motion leaving nothing out for the viewer.",1238457600,,275,4.48
8453789,5,B001B9Y6S6,"This is the culmination of everything that the Panther Vintage series has been building up to: realistic self-defense scenarios.

These were not typical karate or traditional martial arts ""scenarios"". These are situations that we have all either been in ourselves or seen happen to others. The DVD teaches you how to deal with these efficiently, effectively and safely.

The self-defense scenarios include single attackers as well as multiple armed/unarmed criminal attackers. Many of the scenarios are played out in realistic environments with realistic dialogue and acting between Sammy Franco and his students.

It's my opinion that everyone who watches and studies this DVD will be equipped with knowledge to deal many common self-defense scenarios. Definitely check it out.",1238371200,,778,5.576271186440678
