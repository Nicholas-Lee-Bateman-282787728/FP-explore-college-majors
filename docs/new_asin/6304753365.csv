It was made by enjecting scenes with Dracula and Frankenstein into a unwatchable movie called ""Blood Freaks"". It was really bad. I place it in my collection with ""Bride of the Monster"", ""Robot Monster"" and ""Bela Lugosi Meets a Broklyn Gorilla"" as a classic piece of junk. It is no ""Spider Baby"" or ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" but is a step up from ""Santa Claus Versus the Martians"".",1029024000,2,479,4.714285714285714
932263,4,6304753365,"Dracula Vs. Frankenstein was seen by me in a time where I looked forward to horror movies on the weekend on TV.
Most of the time, they were black and white and 30 or 40 years old (which to a kid might as well be 1000 years) and even the color ones had a certain ""in a faraway time"" feel.
So, one of the big surpirses of Dracula Vs. Frankenstein upon seeing it again was that it was pretty contemporary to the 70's. It didn't seem so at the time.
This movie is undeniably bad but it's bad in a way that you can sink your teeth into.
If over the top campiness is a talent J.Carrol Naish is sure acomplished at it. He played the mad scientist to the stereotypical hilt. Make no mistake, scenery chewing makes these film more fun and he did it well. It's unfortunate that the clicking of his false teeth were constantly heard on the soundtrack though.
Zandor Vorkov (his real name is Roger, a stockbroker I believe)manages to play Dracula with that same wonderful, juicy over the top and above campiness while managing to be a bit compelling. Since he was and isn't an actor by trade, I think this deserves some praise. While his look was all wrong (Think Frank Zappa with fangs and a goatee)he gave it his all and seemed to be enjoying himself.
Lon Chaney Jr. turns in his last performance as the crazy mute assistant of Dr. Frankenstein. It's a bit poignant to know that he was very ill during this movie and died soon after. In fact, his part was written as a mute since his throat cancer prevented him from speaking well.
The Frankenstein monster fares the worst. He's just there and not a part of the over the top zaniness that makes Dr. Frankenstein and Dracula so fun in this flick.
The film seems to have it's heart in the right place(I think it wanted to be a bit of a tribute to those great Universal horror films), but the fact that it was filmed over the course of four years and was heavily rewritten and refilmed by people that had never evolved beyond exploitation in the first place kept it from being anything close to a tribute.
Having the DVD gives some insight into the production as well as showing you an alternate ending (explaining why towards the end of the movie, Dracula's makeup and Frankenstein Monster look changes. It was filmed much later with another person playing the monster). It's a good look at the old ins and outs of B movie making.
The great Forrest J. Ackerman makes a cameo by the way (which opened the way to some nice coverage in his Famous Monsters mag).
If you take this movie in the spirit of nostalgic fun, you'll enjoy it. Bad movie fans will get a kick out of it too.",1018137600,3,2614,4.347648261758692
932264,4,6304753365,"This movie defies description, but I'll try.
I recall watching this
schlockfest on ""The Creature-Double-Feature"" program, Saturday
mornings on Channel 56, Boston. The DVD adds all the bits deemed too
scary for the kiddies, and more besides (although rated PG, there is a
hint of bare breast in about two scenes).
The movie is really three
bad horror movies put together in a big blender. There's the
Frankenstien part, the mad doctor part, and the Dracula part, which
smash together into a big ball of mush.
The last surviving member of
the Frankenstiens works with a crazed Lon Chaney to butcher helpless
teens, then bring them back to life so he can extract some kind of
fear-induced serum murdered people produce.
Meanwhile, Drac is in
town, and snatches the body of the Frankenstien monster. He plans to
use Doc's serum on the monster, which will make Drac king of the
vampires, or something like that. Drac teams up with Doc Frankenstien,
and they use the monster to kill their enemies.
Doc has captured
the Judith's sister, and is using her to make his serum. When she
disappears, Judith tries to track her down. She gets slipped some LSD
in a biker bar, and then does a trippy hippie dance and meets up with
some stylin' hippies. They help her to look for her sister, while she
falls in lust with the head guru-hippie-guy. He becomes
action-hippie-guru-guy when it becomes time to battle Drac and Frank
(think Mannix crossed with Mike Brady after he got his hair
permed).
One of the most unique things about this movie, besides
monster vs. monster, is that Drac can fire heat rays from his
ring!
Dracula is played by the filmmakers' stock broker! Though no
Lugosi or Lee, he is strangely effective as a gotee-bearded
Drac!  Forrest J. Ackerman (the writer who coined the shorthand term
""sci-fi""), cameos, and J. Carrol Naish plays Doc Frankenstien. Jim
Davis (Jock Ewing on ""Dallas""), plays a cynical cop, and Russ Tamblyn
(Dr. Jacobi on ""Twin Peaks""), plays Rico, the chief biker bad
guy.
Angelo Rossitto, who plays the carnival dwarf, will be familiar
to film fans. He appeared in the 1932 classic ""Freaks"" (1932), and
""Mr. Wong in Chinatown"" (1939). Horror fans will remember Rossitto in
""The Corpse Vanishes"" (1942), and ""Scared to Death"" (1947), both with
Bela Lugosi. He was also a regular on ""H.R. Pufnstuf"". His most famous
recent role was Master in ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985)

Sadly, in later years he was forced to run a newspaper stand in
Hollywood because he could not make enough money in films to live
on.
The DVD is great, packed with extras, and nice interactive
menus. There's also an alternate ending where Drac drives a silver
hearse! It sounds (and is!), laughable, but on the other hand, what
kind of car would be a better Dracmobile?
Though hardly a classic,
the movie will gratify those monster fans who always wanted to Drac
and Frank fight it out.",990489600,8,2888,4.774

932420,5,6304753365,"Dracula Vs. Frankenstein was a movie from Independent International Pictures, with Sam Sherman acting as Producer, and long time friend and companion Al Adamson working as Director. The movie actually went through numerous changes before finally becoming Dracula Vs. Frankenstein. The original script didn't even have Dracula or Frankenstein in it!

Dracula (Zandor Vorkov, who's real name is Roger Engle) find's the body of the Frankenstein Monster in a cemetary (in California ?!). He brings the body to the wheelchair-bound Dr. Frankenstein (J. Carrol Nash, once famous character actor) who owns a spookhouse at a carnival. Dracula hopes that the Dr.'s ""blood serum"" will render him invulnerable, and in exchange give's him the Monster so that He may get revenge on the Dr. who crippled him (that Dr. is played by Forry Ackerman). Dr. Frankenstein also has a lab assistant, Groton (Lon Chaney Jr. in his final role), who when injected with the blood serum becomes a viscious axe murderer, killing love-makers near a beach! He's also aided by a midget called Grasbo, played by Angelo Rossito! One of his victims is the sister of busty blonde night club performer Judith Fontaine (Regina Carrol, Al Adamson's wife),who decides to take matters into her own hands and look for her sis, when the cops prove useless. However, she gets entangled in a horrifying web of monsters, hippies, and Russ Tamblyn, who looks like he's just waiting for his weed. Finally they stumble upon Dr. F and all is revealed. Groton is killed by the chief of police (Jim Davis), Grasbo falls on an axe, and Dr. Frankenstein's head is chopped off! Judith is kidnapped by Dracula and the Monster, and her love interest is melted by the fierce power of Dracula's ring (a very cheesy, but cool, effect). The Monsters carry her to an old church, and bind her, and her boobs, too a chair. Dracula lights some candles and prepares to have her ""join him in the world of the undead"", but he wasn't counting on the Monster's love for cleavage, and the viscious brute strikes Dracula with a chair (very funny, because it looks like it hurt, and there were obviously no stunt men)! Frankie knocks his ring off and chases Dracula into the woods. They then battle in day for night photography that is too dark. Finally Drac tears the Monster apart piece by piece, ripping his arms and his head off. Drac rushes back to his coffin, but the sun comes up and Dracula is fried, turning his face into a $0.75 halloween mask! Judith breaks free of the ropes, and after a nice close-up of her cleavage, she leaves and the movie ends! Wow.

Yes, there are two Dracula Vs. Frankensteins, but this is the ""real"" one. The other DvF is actually Assignment Terror, a Paul Naschy Hombre Lobo vehicle, where all the horror heavyweights battle it out, when they are ressurected by an alien played by Michael Rennie. It was retitled DvF for the American market in 1969....or '70, I think. Naschy is one of my all time faves, but this is about I.I.P.'s Dracula Vs. Frankenstein!

Lon Chaney Jr., and J. Carrol Nash worked together many times before, but most notably in House of Frankenstein!

There are many references to Son of Frankenstein in Dracula Vs. Frankenstein. Names and dialouge. Forrest J. Ackerman plays Dr. Bomont, which was the name of the crooked doctor in Son of Frankenstein. Also, the idea of having Dracula tear Frankenstein apart ""piece by piece just as Frankenstein created him"" is also mentioned in Son of Frankenstein.

Unfortunatly, Al Adamson was murdered a couple years ago by a man hired to work on his house. His body was discovered inside the cement pool foundation! And this was only a short time after Regina Carrol died of cancer. Al spent all his time and money fighting her inevitable passing, a fight no one could have one. The world has lost two wonderful entertainers...

Thankfully, all of Al's movies are now widely available on DVD for all fans of B-cinema to enjoy. But be warned these movies are dated, and a younger or more modern, or simply ignorant audience, will NOT appreciette them. Their loss, cause these are some very fun movies, and Dracula Vs. Frankenstein is easily one of the best of them!",1127088000,2,4190,4.788381742738589

2.)  Frankensteins who look like the Michelin Man with a banana cream pie slammed on his face and a red-neck mullet hairdo you might see on a Jeff Foxworthy show?

3.)  Retarded assistants who pet innocent puppies by day and hack up teenage chicks on the boardwalk at night?

4.)  Washed-up actors who play mad professors reading lines off of cue-cards?

5.)  Biker gangs that have NOTHING to do with the plot

6.)  Psychodelic LSD scenes that have NOTHING to do with the plot

7.)  Vampires entering churches

Then this flick is for you!!  Drac vs. Frank is a HILARIOUS B-movie, heck, this isn't even ""B"" it's more like ""Y"" or ""Z"" level! It's awful but somehow delightfully funny. Dracula has conjured up a really jacked-up looking Frankenstein monster in a cemetary and he wants to reanimate the monster with the help of Doc. Frankenstein (J. Carroll Naish who does a HORRIBLE job of being a mad professor) and his amazing laboratory (wait till you check out these special effects!! George Lucas and ILM eat your heart out!!).

What results is Dracula and Frankenstein kicking some butt and then fighting over a blonde. Doesn't that always happen!!? Well, they wind up at a Church. Isn't that odd?  The Prince of Darkness' lackey, Dracula, on hallowed ground?? HMMM. Drac and Frank get into a huge battle royal that you can't even see because it's so damned dark!! But, we see Drac rip Frank's head off (or something) and the show's over.

Don't watch this movie for the battle, watch it for all the hilarious dialogue!!, weird psychodelic nonsense, Dracula and his awesome afro, and the hippies!!

First of all, the movie's original title is Assignment Terror. It's a better title seeing as those two monsters never fight. Plus, at least in this dubbed version, Frankenstein is called the ""Franksallen Monster"" for copyright reasons. The movie's name was changed by TV syndicators in the 70's for who-knows- what reason. There are widescreen, subtitled versions of this movie, under it's original title available elsewhere on the web. I have yet to see the original version. UAV's EP VHS copy looks awful.

The movie is watchable, however. The plot is a takeoff on Plan 9 from outer space using wannabees of Universal's classic monsters. Paul Naschy's classic werewolf is the only standout among the monsters. The rest look cheap. This is a monsterously fun movie, although Al Adamson's D v. F is much superior.

He takes over the body of an earth scientist, and steals the bodies of Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, and the Wolfman (All with changed names). Dracula and Frankenstein never lay eyes on each other, but the Wolfman takes down the Mummy and Frankenstein (after being flung around by both of them-he just gets lucky). Dracula is too wimped out for my taste (he actually gets his ass kicked by a cop-I mean literally gets his ass kicked).

932508,4,6304753365,"This is one Grade A, cheesy stinkfest of a film, as anyone should reasonable expect from Al Adamson, King of Gouda, as it were. I find myself curiously unable to summarize the 'plot', which very well could stem from a veritable lack of coherent story, but that's half the fun of these Grade Z classics, anyway. I do want to spend a moment here to about the qualities that make this a true prize for fans of the truly horrible monster movie genre, of which I count myself at the forefront.
Adamson didn't have much money when he made this film (obviously) so his strategy was simple: get one star and the remainder of the cast could be relatives, friends, street people, etc. In this case, poor Lon Chaney gets the nod to play the extremely cliche mute (and dumb) lab assistant to J. Carrol Naish, a wheelchair bound, garden variety mad scientist, who severs people's heads off and tried to bring them back to life. He is befriended by the worst Dracula EVER (Zandor Vorkhov), who I think looks like Frank Zappa on uppers. Dracula just happens to have a business proposition for Naish involving bringing Frankenstein's Monster back from the dead because he just happens to have part of the original monster lying around his house. Of course they do this with wires and electricity, and what emerges is a monster truly worthy of this Dracula, in other words, laughable. He appears to be the Sta-Puft Marshmallow Man with extremely bad acne, whose only real power is walking like Jimmy Cagney.
Into the mix come a few meddling kids, one of whom is on a search for her little sister (actually a prisoner of Naish) and a guy she brings along, who has the ugliest pants I have ever seen in my entire life. After showing us a gratuitous Nazi motorcycle gang rape scene thwarted by Lon's ax, and a wretched 'walk on the beach' scene with an unbelievably bad piece of music, none of which has any particular relevance to the rest of the film, we get back to the central story (as it were) by having the good guys (big sister and ugly pants guy) go to the freak show where Naish works. Eventually they confront Naish, who reveals the sister, and says a bunch of stuff about her making the exactly right kind of plasma (I'm actually a bit fuzzy on the science angle of all this, sorry.) A midget carnival barker enters the fray and drops Lon Chaney's puppy into the basement, which irritates Lon, so he falls onto an ax face first in one of the lamest 'special effects' I have ever seen. This is quickly followed by Naish getting a gun, but wheeling inadvertently into his own guillotine, where, of course, he gets his head chopped off. The movie then has people running around all over the place (kind of reminiscent of the laboratory scene in ""The Wild, Wild World of Batwoman"") and eventually Dracula ties the big sister to an oil refinery; ugly pants guy frees her by scaring off Frankenstein's monster with a sparkler; Dracula melts the ugly pants guy with a very bad special effect beam from his ring of evil; blonde girl, the monster and Dracula all run around in the woods a while, end up at an entirely new location where the monster and Dracula fight over the girl (at least that's what I believe was happening), the girl shrieks a lot, and Dracula runs through the woods some more to a church (?), where he collapses and is burned up by the sun. OK, any questions?
Yes, it is THAT kind of movie. I am sure that there are some subtle nuances that I didn't capture in the above summary, but you get the general idea. The movie was rated ""GP"", which was the direst precursor to ""PG"" (really), and doesn't really have what I would consider realistic gore, more like gruesome tastelessness. There is a very small bit of nudity (breast) on a 'patient' in the crazy doctor's lab, but that's really the only thing objectionable. Well, except for the plot, direction, production values, casting, and continuity, anyway.
If you like cheesy bad movies, it is hard to top Adamson, and this is one of his best (worst). I gave it four stars simply because of length. It is fairly long for this type of film (I didn't time it, but trust me, it is long, or at least feels that way) and drags in a few places, notably in the running around in the woods scenes. Also contributing to the loss of one star was the dreadful music video style beach walk montage sequence, which showed mostly waves and seagulls for about three years, I mean minutes, while excremental music was being played in the background.
If you like bad, and I mean really bad, movies, this is not to be missed.",1074297600,9,4561,4.509661835748792
932509,5,6304753365,"I can remember even as a small child watching it and cringing, recognizing a bad movie before I knew what a bad movie was.

Two initial point of observation:

(A) The dork playing Dracula was the worst Dracula EVER. The Count from Sesame Street makes a more credible vampire, or maybe T.J. Hooker, Matt Houston, Mary Tyler Moore, or even the shark from Jaws. This Dracula eerily resembles King Diamond. I kept waiting for him to tear off with a verse from Abigail or Them. This version of Dracula is portrayed somewhat like a talking mime, complete with three inches of white grease paint, lipstick, and large raccoon-like black patches around the eyes. Additionally, Dracula is the only character in the movie with a built-in echo.

(B) Wow! Frankenstein's Monster resembles Frankenstein's Baked Potato. His face is a bloated, rotten, clenched mess in which features are only minimally identifiable. The Monster is atypically distinguished by the extra-small jacket, heavy shoulder pads, and block-mounted elevator shoes. The Monster's method of attack: Snarling and bellowing, the monster shoves and slaps his victims to death. There is no escape. You will die screaming, your eyeballs pummeled from their sockets.

The plot of this movie, such as it is, involves King Diamond, I mean Dracula, seeking out the modern day descendant of the original Frankenstein. Dracula is interested in having the modern day Frankenstein ply his mad scientist wares on Dracula's behalf. And apparently, for no other reason than to serve the movie title, Dracula wants to exhume the immortal remains of the Monster; fortunately, and conveniently, the Monsters just happens to be buried a stretch down the road in the local graveyard. But the wheelchair-ridden Frankenstein decides he doesn't want to take orders from Count Diamond, I mean Dracula---so Dracula grimly unveils his gigantic plastic-looking silver monster-ring and shoots a poorly-animated lightning bolt at the wall.

Yeah, that's what I thought, Frankenstein, now straighten up.

Mixed into the supernatural intrigue is the blonde woman searching for her missing hippy sister; unbeknownst to her, the sister has in fact been abducted by Frankenstein as test stock for Frankenstein's evil experimentations! The blonde woman is subsequently captured by Dracula and conveyed to Dracula's new lair, the local church (the chosen sanctuary for all vampires). Dracula intends to exsanguinate the blonde woman, but is rebuked when the Monster shows an interest in the captive. Dracula retaliates, brandishing his disproportionately large plastic fangs.

The fight is on, baby! The Thrilla in Salmonella. Tickets by the Boardwalk, just look for the little guy with the hat. Dracula, at approximately 6 minutes until sunrise, backs out of the church and fifty yards into the adjoining woods. He stands there trying to give his best onstage magician performance scary face while the gargling and growling Monster pushes and slaps at him. Dracula counters the attack by taking the Monster apart like a cheaply-stuffed doll. The Monster refuses to back down, persisting even when both arms have been dismembered and the Monster is no longer capable of his patented shoving/slapping attack. Dracula is ultimately forced to behead the Monster.

Suddenly, the sun is rising. Oh sweet Countess Bathory! Dracula breaks into a staggering half-hearted run, moving back towards the church entrance. Just as he makes to the steps, near to the structure's threshold, Dracula succumbs to the sun's destroying influence, going from runny make-up King Diamond, to ashy-face King Diamond, and finally to skull-face King Diamond. Man, he almost made it, and alas, had he done so, there might have been intriguing sequels such as Dracula vs. Milo, Dracula vs. The Legend of Boggy Creek, or even Dracula vs. Xanadu.",1064016000,31,3835,5.285714285714286
932510,3,6304753365,"My feelings regarding this film were always ambivalent. I saw it at a child and loved it. However, as I've aged, my attitude towards it is more complex. I'm a distant relative of J. Carrol Naish (a point of pride with me; for those whose only exposure to him is this film, catch him starring with Bogart in ""Sahara."") and I've loved Lon Chaney since childhood, so there's something painful in watching this film as an adult and seeing the ignominious circumstances these 2 legends ended their careers in, considering the artistry they had both been capable of (for those whose only image of Chaney is as ""The Wolfman"", catch him in ""Of Mice And Men""). Also, I'm not one to indulge in the trend of elitist contempt towards the low-budget films of the 60's and early 70's. ""Golden Turkeys"" indeed. Silly, laughable cinematic atrocities? Perhaps, but there's nothing worse, in my opinion, than the insulting multi-million dollar pablum that Hollywood currently purveys ad nauseam. I'll take ""Frankenstein's Daughter"" over ""Gigli"" any day of the week. At the very least, Al Adamson had the passion of a true fan of the old-time horror movies. No, this isn't Karloff's ""Frankenstein"" or Laughton's ""Island of Lost Souls."" It's not even ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things."" But if you're willing to watch it in the spirit in which it was made, and you've fortified yourself with several bottles of beer, it can be diverting, escapist entertainment. Surely that has to count for something in this bleak day and age.",1061596800,,1515,4.898832684824903
932511,2,6304753365,"Will B-Movie buffs enjoy this Al Adamson classic? It all depends on just how cheesy you prefer your B-Movies! Flicks like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" or ""Swamp Girl"" stay fun partly because they cut to the chase, they move along at quick enough pace that you tend to stay enthralled with the campiness of it all.
This Al Adamson classic definitely has it's moments, but much of the silly dialogue tends to be lengthy, the chase scenes drawn out, and the lighting often so bad it's.....well, you have no idea what is happening onscreen!
The crowning glory is Regina Carol's Las Vegas song and dance  number where two black-clad gentlemen prance around as her back-up singers. The song will leave you baffled, the gaudiness of the stage and curtains will leave you seeing spots for the rest of the evening, and Regina... I must admit, Regina was a hep chick!
Dracula is comical, Frankenstein's mask looks like deep fried oatmeal, and the hippies placed throughout the movie probably looked way more way-out than the hippies of that era!",1046476800,,1032,4.76536312849162

The film sounds like an updated and revised version of Ed Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. Of course, that's such a bad film why would anyone try to update it? Anyway, the title is totally bogus because Dracula and Frankenstein don't fight each other in this film. In fact, they are never seen in the same room.

The acting is bad. The writing is horrible. The editing makes the movie look like the film was ran through a food processor. The lighting turns everything a dark shade of grey. The music clashes between suspenseful and hilarious. The dubbing (the movie wasn't made in the USA) doesn't match up well and makes a Godzilla movie look like an Oscar winner.

Overall, stay away. In the words of Joseph Conrad's Kurtz ""The horror, the horror!""",1040688000,,1024,4.350785340314136

Perhaps there's some well-respected classic out there I've just never heard of.  Or maybe they met in some long-forgotten piece of cinematic garbage--some low budget quickie that featured terrible acting, with dialogue so incredibly dull that it would leave anyone who viewed it, including half-wits, clawing at their skulls in agony.

7877964,1,6304753365,"Well, I knew going into this mess, I wouldn't be getting much out of it. At the very least a few hearty laughs, but nothing could prepare me for what I was about to see. A monster film!? YES INDEED! My title suggesting that Dracula looks like Jim Croce (maybe Frank Zappa?)is a stretch, but it made me laugh as I wrote it as my title blurb.....also the actor playing Dracula looks about as much like  Dracula as if Jim Croce wore a cape and painted his face with white grease paint.  :-D

I can not even imagine how someone sold this idea, but they did accomplish one thing, they ruined the good names of Dracula and Frankenstein forever! The film has it all, atrocious acting, horrible special effects and make up and above all, a ridiculous and tedious script! I must admit that the film was a little bit better than I expected ,partly because I was seeing it in HD on MGMHD network and of course it is unintentionally funny at times.

I'm going to skip to the funny part which is the battle between Dracula (who is covered in white grease paint complete with two inches of black grease paint around his eyes and vampire teeth he bought at the nearest 5 and 10 store) and Frankenstein(I know, I know Frankenstein's monster...lets just get this over with all ready!)  Frankenstein looks like a cross between Mr. Potato Head and a Cabbage Patch Kid left at the city garbage dump for a decade. I skip to this battle because the rest of the film is just excruciating to watch, but at least the battle is hilarious enough to warrant a review. Dracula literally tears Frankenstein apart limb from limb just minutes before sunrise. Dracula then slowly burns to a deep crispy skeleton with obvious cut-aways every few seconds to change the prop Dracula to the next stage.  While I can not recommend this film if you see this on your local cable channel like I did, then it might be worth checking out for a few laughs.",1294272000,2,1912,4.464183381088826

Carrol Naish exploited in such a sleazy manner. Directed by the infamous schlockmeister Al Adamson, who further humiliated an ailing Chaney in ""The Female Bunch."" No redeeming value whatsoever.",1270425600,,367,5.237288135593221
7877966,2,6304753365,"""Dracula vs. Frankenstein"" is a one of a kind monstrosity that only the legendary Al Adamson could make. Easily rivaling Ed Wood for plot incoherence, terrible dialogue, subplots leading nowhere, and wooden acting, this film must be seen to be believed. I give it two stars for a modicum of B-movie camp value, but then again, I'm in a pretty generous mood today.

The film wastes no time in beginning with utterly ridiculous credits, and after a brief introduction to Count Dracula (Zandor Vorkov, who sports the very worst facial makeup I have ever seen) the film breaks your neck in a cut to an abysmal Las Vegas musical revue with obligatory blonde starlet. It turns out that the starlet is looking for her lost sister, and after a colorful jaunt through some of the ugliest clothes ever seen on screen, the singer ends up dealing with a midget at ""Dr. Durray's Creature Emporium."" The good Doctor (J. Carrol Naish in his last role) is a wheelchair bound descendant of Dr. Frankenstein. He has as his assistant, a mute, ax-wielding, puppy-loving, serum-addicted sidekick, Lon Chaney, Jr., also in his last role. I felt bad for Chaney that he had to stoop to playing parts in movies of this quality. There is even one point where Chaney has to wear a mask, which is pointless as by this time in his life his actual face was more frightening than the mask could have possibly been.

The film then takes a right turn with the line ""All illusions look real, or they wouldn't be illusions, would they?"" This ushers in the hippie and biker part of the film. This is a subplot that really and truly goes nowhere, but it does serve to pad the film immensely. The hippies just want to protest, because it's fun; this all leads to the singer getting knocked out in a nightclub and winding up with a puka shell wearing hippie who is really deep, man. How does Dracula get into the act? He comes to Dr. Frankenstein-Durray and tells him he has found the original Frankenstein's Monster buried in a grave in Venice, California, close to the lab. I give you pause to consider the imponderables involved here. Of course it comes as zero surprise that Dr. Frankenstein has the singer's sister held prisoner (she's been decapitated and reanimated, but is generally a quiet little zombie) and that a confrontation looms.

We are treated to shots of Dracula's fire-shooting ring, the worst moustaches in screen history (exhibit one: Dr. Beaumont [Forest J. Ackerman]), and without question the most ridiculous Frankenstein Monster ever. Hands down. There's a dramatic subplot about surfing, some pointless conflict with bikers, and an excrementally bad love ballad while two young lovers stroll on the beach. Truly this film has something for everyone.

Throughout the bulk of the film, the title is quite misleading as Dracula and Frankenstein are allied with each other. What could destroy the alliance? The Las Vegas lounge singer, of course: both monsters want her for themselves. The battle that ensues is epic in its silliness, and at one point reminded me of the ""Black Knight"" scene from ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" (Watch it and you'll see why.) Eventually both the monsters destroy each other and the singer escapes the maelstrom unscathed. I gave Adamson an extra star for this movie for having the guts to make the last minute or so of the film into a bad art house film featuring flashbacks of dubious quality and zero significance, followed by an abrupt ending. Truly a work of anti-genius if there ever was one.

The DVD features a couple of extras, including the original trailer and a couple of drive in shorts. My favorite by far was the ad for Tony's Pizza featuring an interview with an animated stomach reclining in a wagon. Don't miss it!",1246320000,,3752,4.766153846153846
