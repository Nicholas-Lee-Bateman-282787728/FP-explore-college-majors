8253806,1,B00140PKD2,"I heard about this movie when I was in high school (20 years ago) and have wanted to see it since, purely for the fact the killer has the same surname as me.
I love trashy horror movies but this one is the bottom of the barrel. The story is just plain boring and dumb, it can't even be lumped into the so bad it's good category. There's no tension built up at any point. Shots that could've been completed in 30 secs are dragged on for minutes that feel like hours. ""Come on man, I'm about to die of boredom here, move the story!""

It's 68 minutes of your life you will never get back.",1450483200,,585,4.043103448275862
8253807,5,B00140PKD2,"My 5 star rating is actually a -5 stars. This is one of those so bad its good movies. And this one is one of the worst! I freakin love it! From the beginning in the hospital I could tell this movie was going to be a piece of crab! But good piece of crap! The movie revolves around a sick dude, by the name of John Lucker, and boy is he screwed up. This guy loves to rape women but preferes to rape them dead (is it really rape then?) and doesn't mind if they are bloody, mutilated or burnt to a crisp (i think he actually prefers them like that as well). I kinda dozed out around the end of it so I didn't get to see how it ended, but I can't say this is a movie to own, but if your like me and just wanna own the sickest movies known to mankind, then save a spot on the rack for Lucker.",1444089600,,787,3.746987951807229

8253809,4,B00140PKD2,"This is a grisly and seedy exploitation flick that aims to present a depressing tone throughout. Whether or not you find it shocking might depend on how many of these exploitation films you watch and your taste. It's extremely easy to follow, and it won't appeal to everyone; you can just turn your brain off and watch it because you don't have to worry at all about paying attention to it. As soon as the film begins, we see Lucker incapacitated in a hospital bed from medication. He quickly awakens, and we then follow him through the hospital where a good and violent gore sequence is delivered. After that, he goes outside and kills a woman for her car in a non-gory sequence. He then drives around a bit and parks the car before having sex with the corpse in a scene that is shown for just a bit before cutting away. He then exits the car, and the viewer follows him down streets and other places as he goes on a murder spree and searches for some girl who escaped him before. The star of the film is the killer, and there's no character development other than him. The film centers on him, as you simply watch him go from place to place to stalk and kill. Very little screen time is given to some other random characters who enter the picture in some spots. There's some brief topless nudity during a flashback with a sequence dealing with him carrying a severed head and a woman chained on a bed, and there's another short sequence where you see some fuzzy nude scenes that he's watching on a TV screen. Other than that, there's some full male nudity from him that isn't well lit because of the movies picture quality that's kind of murky. There's only one necrophilia scene that's really shown, and this sequence doesn't cut away like the other scene earlier on in the film. This sequence with a rotted corpse is prolonged and simply made to shock viewers. As for the films violence, some scenes are very violent and gory while some others hold back on the gore. None of the violent scenes resemble something like in a FRIDAY THE 13th film. All these scenes try to be impactful and disturbing, but whether or not succeeds is a matter of opinion. I thought the picture has some excellent soundtracks, and the movie is low on dialogue throughout. The film is never talky, and the pace is usually fast; but it doesn't have much atmosphere, interesting scenery, or suspense. Whether or not you get bored in parts might depend on how much you like the directing style, the soundtracks, and whether or not you like a film that's basically showing and centering on this one character throughout. Another problem is your tolerance for the picture quality which is far from pristine.

As explained by the director in an interview on the DVD, VHS sources are all that's left of the film. The director filmed some new scenes for this release that usually show some scenery, and there's no added dialogue, gore or nudity that was filmed. These short scenes that were recently filmed are added into the movie, and the quality on these quick parts is very good. The rest of the movie is from VHS. The color and contrast are usually fine, but the picture is murky and kind of dark. It has some problems with sharpness, and the entire thing has grain. There's also color bleeding with some parts looking worse than others. There's also some other short parts that look washed out and worse than the rest of the film. Some people will think the quality is poor. There's a directors interview on the DVD, as well as the Dutch version of the film. This version has censored gore, but it has some added sequences.",1383177600,,3601,4.54
8253810,1,B00140PKD2,"If you are looking into this film then it is either because you've heard about it or you just happened upon this page because you are into films that are disturbing, extreme, gory, etc.  Please, I implore you, do not waste your time.  There are many films with so-called ""notorious"" reputations that deliver the goods and this sorry film is not one of them.

Firstly, the title of this film is a misnomer.  Lucker is a necrophiliac.  Necrophagous means feeding on the dead where as what he is doing is 100% sexual in nature.  Now, don't get excited, there isn't much of that to be found at all.  I mean, for the time period and obvious budgetary limitations, the gore and the one rotting corpse is actually not bad.  But if you are in the market for disturbing necrophiliac films let me please recommend far better/more intense films:  Aftermath, Nekromantic, Nekromantic 2, etc.

The main problem with this film is that it is just...plain bad.  I suppose to complain about the lack of plot would be pointless.  Obviously you simply follow the titular killer through a series of laughably ill-conceived murders that happen for no rhyme or reason.  Now, I have no issue with plotless gore-fare (I'm a fan of the infamous Guinea Pig films after all) but this just doesn't work on any level.  Doesn't have the gore, the plot development, or the disturbing factor to make this a worthwhile horror viewing experience.  The horrific acting is pretty bad but it is the awful, AWFUL voice acting of the female victims that just makes this a grating film to sit through.

I wish that I could say you could laugh your way through it but it really is just a failure of a film.  For a 68 minute film, it definitely felt like an eternity.  Please fellow horrorhounds, look else where.  You WILL be disappointed.",1339027200,2,1798,4.632911392405063
8253811,1,B00140PKD2,"This movie is nothing compared to Aftermath and Nekromantik. It is very cheap. The acting is so lame that I was laughing. Sound effects are terrible. The plot is dumb. Don't waste your money.

P.S. But it is better than Avatar anyway=))",1269648000,2,236,4.619047619047619
8253812,2,B00140PKD2,"As another reviewer mentions,the scene with Lucker humping the 4 weeks of rotting corspe of his latest victim,a hooker(which he also licks the slime off of)is the most notable scene,one star for this alone. The rest of the feature itself was pretty good with the creepy atmosphere,too bad for the visuals and audio(especially the sound effects)because they most certainly really ruin the experience. They title the special features as the Horrific Special Features(the're not foolin)as they were left only with shabby video material to work with in the the transfer to DVD(all the original materials were destroyed).I would have given a 4  star rating had it not been for the bleeding picture(I'm not talking about the blood)and annoying sound effects that gave me an earache and yes I really need to mention the sound effects again as they are the worst I have ever come across. I also felt more justified in my 1 star rating just to bring the rating down a bit and let people know exactly what their getting in buying this. That is a fuzzy VHS copy with horrible audio. Perhaps I would not have been as dissapointed if they sold this for 1/3rd of what I paid and had better sound effects.  The corspe sex was really a sick good time. It's a shame the source materials for DVD transfer were so lousy.",1229385600,2,1301,4.701754385964913
8253813,2,B00140PKD2,"It took years of knowing this title existed for me to see it on a really low grade vhs copy in a friend's basement theater in or around 1993.  Can't say the dvd release really helped the quality of the source material... but it's hard to complain about quality when the movie in question's main payoff scene is a badly edited ""corpse humping"".",1226275200,,343,4.444444444444445
8253814,3,B00140PKD2,"If your reading this then you must already know something about this somewhat notorious film, does it live up to the hype? yes it does. First this movie is one of the lost grey market films of the late 1980's and if you were like me, traded blurry bootleg copies of this one for years because nothing was ever available, bad sound and picture and often with strange sub-titles on the bottom in some unknown europeon language. Story goes the original masters were destroyed and it was thought that this title was probably dust to the ages. Thanks to Don May and the wonderful group at Synapse Films, ( The absolute gold standard of gritty exploitive cult cinema!) and my personal reason to keep living, we have another fine addition to our growing DVD library. This is not Synapse's usual flawless release due to the state of the original source material, but is leaps and bounds ahead of what we used to get under the counter at those old comic book conventions, this is as good as this film ever looked. This is in a new "" Directors Cut "" made in cooperation with the original director who also sadly recently died. If you are a fan of titles like Necromantik and Aftermath and never heard of this, you will appreciate it's sickness , buy it and help support this film team in bringing hard to find or unreleased grindhouse cult cinema to the masses in lovingly restored package editions, Bravo!",1215648000,9,1396,4.565737051792829
