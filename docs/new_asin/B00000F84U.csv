7907276,1,B00000F84U,"you can tell just by looking at Sifu Klein\Mr. Weis's uniform and body position on the cover that he is a kung fu practitioner. He and Mr Lyons might be exemplory kung fu practitioners for all we know, but the fact of the matter is, it's wrong to make a video marketing a style of martial art you obviously know knothing about.  Stick to kung fu. Oh, and it also seems wrong to give 2 five-star reviews in a video that you starred in ""Mr. Weiss.""",1106611200,,446,4.186046511627907
7907277,1,B00000F84U,Only someone with absoloutely no concept of what Muay Thai is would even consider buying this. Read the other reviews and note which ones seem generic and which seem relevant. Don't waste your money...,1005696000,7,201,4.9411764705882355
7907278,5,B00000F84U,"I just want to add my comments to what I see is unanimous approval.  The teacher, Robert Lyons is a great teacher.  He explains the principles and concepts alongwith each technique. He performs the technique and has his partner perform it from different angles.  Everything is clear.  It's a great tape for anyone in any martial art.  Just wanted to comment on this amazing tape.",980294400,,379,4.769230769230769
7907279,5,B00000F84U,"This video is well made, the instructions are just like you are in a Thai Kickboxing class and the teacher, Robert Lyons is very skilled.  The techniques shown are powerful and an important additon to any martial arts  training.  This is one of the best tapes I've seen for sparring and also  for street self defense.  I refer to it frequently.",964051200,2,344,4.573770491803279
7907280,5,B00000F84U,"This is a must tape for anyone interested in sparring.  Thai Kickboxing is a devastating martial art and here, Robert Lyons explains it step-by-step, in great detail.  It is clear how effective it would be in many situations.  Lyons shows how to use the legs, arms, elbows, knees, etc. to deflect and  to strike.  It is a very easy tape to follow and would give you a great  advantage in sparring.  This is a great tape!",963878400,,420,4.447368421052632
7907281,5,B00000F84U,I heard about Thai Kickboxing and just wanted to see what it was all about.  I had other tapes of Robert Lyons so I felt confident it would be a good tape. I have to say that this tape gave me a lot of new ideas and a  whole new approach to my sparring.  This is not one of those aerobic  exercise tapes like Tae Bo.  It is a real training tape in this style.  Lyons uses elbows and knees and everything else.  He has a way of  explaining the body mechanics so you can really put the techniques to use.  I like this style and I like Lyons energy and enthusiasm.  You could use  these techniques alongwith any style to make your style more complete.,957916800,,648,4.063492063492063
7907282,5,B00000F84U,"Robert Lyons teaches theory, stances, footwork, kicks, punches, elbow, leg and arm blocks and combinations.  there is one-on-one instruction with a partner.  Master Lyons emphasizes practical street applications of the  techniques.  He shows each technique clearly and from several angles and  explains how to practice them.",956016000,,324,5.956521739130435
