8717204,4,B00XZKQBJQ,"Every few years the Salzburg Festival replaces the productions of the three Mozart/da Ponte collaborations with new productions. At least in recent years they have entrusted all three to the same director but the ""refresh"" happens in different years and not always in the same order. I watched Claus Guth's offerings and noted the way that certain linking elements developed over the course of the ""cycle"". I was interested to see whether the same thing held for the newest iteration by Sven-Eric Bechtolf. All three have now been released on Blu-ray (though due to availability issues I have the Cos on DVD) so I thought I should watch them in the order they appeared at the festival and see what transpires. So here we go with Cos fan tutte recorded in 2013 in the Haus fr Mozart.


Bechtolf's programme notes suggest that he sees the piece as being about the struggle between reason and emotion with the latter winning in the end and the effort to impose order on it as essentially destructive. Don Alfonso, and by implication da Ponte represent the Man of the Enlightenment; Reason with a capital R. Mozart, by contrast through his music, giving full reign to all the complex emotions of the characters. It's quite an interesting idea though hardly a grand concept but how does it play out?

In Act 1 it's barely evident. On the face of it we have a highly traditional production in eighteenth century dress (sort of) set in a conservatory so there are lots of plants for characters to skulk behind and there is much skulking. The principal concern of the director seems to be to present a series of very decorative and mostly symmetrical tableaux vivants. Perhaps this is a personification of Order? Even the Albanian disguises are Albanian disguises! Things only start to come apart at Come scoglio where Fiordiligi seems to be under enormous emotional strain and has to repeatedly restrained by Dorabella before actually collapsing and having to be revived.

Act 2 is rather different. Now we are in some sort of dining room and the trees are outside (but still skulkable). Both girls are very drunk. When Fiordiligi confesses that despite her proper behaviour she is actually in love with ""Ferrando"" she is obviously horrified and becomes increasingly distraught. Both Fiordiligi and Guglielmo seem very unhappy with both the Albanian ""marriage"" and the final reconciliation. There's a very peculiar incident in which Guglielmo creates and stabs a fruit sculpture. As things progress Don Alfonso's role becomes more obviously interventionist and, amid the emotional disintegration of Fiordiligi, the cruel side of the piece becomes clearer and clearer. It ends with Despina utterly disillusioned with the part she has played and Don Alfonso inadvertently poisoning himself. If Reason has triumphed it's at great cost.
And so to the performances. I'm going to go out on a limb and say you will have to search far and wide to find a better sung or acted Cos. The star is Malin Hartelius as Fiordiligi. She produces absolutely gorgeous Mozart singing coupled with acting out a complex emotional journey entirely convincingly. She's well partnered by the Dorabella of Marie-Claude Chappuis. The pair of them are staggeringly (literally) good in the drunk scene which is a bit of comic relief as the production darkens.

The guys are really good too. Luca Pisaroni's Guglielmo is strongly sung and there's throughout a sense that he's not comfortable with Don Alfonso's game or life in general. He has a touch of dangerousness that's very appealing. Martin Mitterrutzner sings Ferrando. He's a fine Mozart tenor (all three arias are lovely) and portrays a more genial character rather well. Gerald Finley is Don Alfonso with Martina Jankov as a somewhat more matronly than usual Despina. Both are first class singers. Finley's portrayal of Don Alfonso as a disillusioned (and rather insensitive) string puller is masterly. As seems to be the case for me with this piece I scarcely noticed the orchestra which means it must be OK. For the record it's the Vienna Phil with Christoph Eschenbach.

Tiziano Mancini does a pretty good job with the cameras. At least he shows us enough to see the formalism of Act 1 as I think Bechtolf intended. Even on DVD the sound (DTS 5.0 with Dolby surround and PCM stereo as alternatives) and picture are just fine. Watching the Don Giovanni on Blu-ray for a few minutes suggests that if you can find the Cos in that format you will get a slighter more detailed picture and more immediate sound. There are no extras (bar a few trailers) on the disks but the booklet has Bechtolf's production notes and a detailed track listing and synopsis. Subtitle options are English, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Japanese.",1488067200,,4753,4.949874686716792
8717205,5,B00XZKQBJQ,"This DVD of the Christoph Eschenbach conducted production of Mozarts Cosi Fan Tutte, recorded at the Salzburg Festival in August of 2013, features Malin Hartelius (soprano) as Fiordiligi, Marie-Claude Chappuis (mezzo-soprano) as Dorabella, Martina Jankova (soprano) as Despina, Gerald Finley (baritone) as the instigator Don Alfonso, and Luca Pisaroni (bass-baritone) and Martin Mitterrutzner (tenor) as Guglielmo and Ferrando respectively.  And what a delightful and insightful cast they are, Ms. Hartelius fresh and emotionally pleasing soprano perfectly complimenting the warmth and clarity of Ms. Chappuis.  Similarly, Mr. Pisaroni and Mr. Mitterrutzner fit together on stage and vocally as if they belong together.  And Gerald Finleys strong, warm, baritone shines in the role of Don Alfonso  and it is clear that he is having a great time in the role as well.

As for the opera itself, the story requires (admittedly) more than a bit of suspension of disbelief.  The notion of pretending to be sent away, placing fiances in emotional distress, and returning in disguise to attempt to seduce the other persons fianc to prove loyalty and fidelity is certainly a bit distasteful despite the fact that the music is *glorious*.  However, these performers make it easy to get lost in the plot elements that are silliness at best, and while many productions of this opera come across as two-dimensional, Ms. Hartelius portrayal of Fiordiligi is astonishingly aching in that she does not want to betray the trust of her fianc even though she is finding herself attracted to her suitor  and her torment is evident in her posture, the pinch of her eyes, and every note of her beautiful voice.  She truly stood out in this production for me, and I can only imagine how marvelous it was to see this in person.  Mr. Finleys Don Alfonso is also particularly well played, not with any derision or hints of jaded malice as I have seen in other productions.

The set is wonderful, and the opening bathing scene (a pool inset into the stage  excellent!) just adds to the feeling of authenticity to what is being depicted.  This is also aided by outstanding physical and vocal work from Ms. Jankovas Despina.  She is a treat to watch, and the portions of the production that require physical comedic elements she handles perfectly.  And I cant say enough about the Wiener Philharmoniker under the baton of Christoph Eschenbach.  The music jumped out of my speakers with joie de vivre, and the musicians definitely gave the cast a vibrant base to work from.
This is absolutely the best production of Cosi Fan Tutte that I have ever experienced.  I am delighted to have this in my collection, and strongly recommend it as a valuable addition to any opera lovers library.",1450656000,4,2755,5.006578947368421
8717206,5,B00XZKQBJQ,"We tend to make allowances for everything but the singing and the orchestral playing in opera. A slightly wooden tenor or over-the-top histrionic soprano is good enough if the singing is superlative, though wed complain about similar acting in a play or film. This is relevant especially with comedy. So often some smirks and a bit of stage business put together at the last minute will have to do, even in the great comedy-dramas of Mozart. Thats why this production of Cosi fan Tutte is such a surprise, and a delight. The six principles are all gifted farceurs: Malin Hartelius and Luca Pisaroni as the sisters, Luca Pisaroni and Martin Mitterrutzner as their suitors, Marie-Claude Chappuis as the amoral maid, and the great Gerald Finley as the puppet master Don Alfonso. This isn't just good comedy for an opera, its great comedy that wouldnt be out of place in a West End production of a Wilde or Ayckbourn play. Better than that, the timing of the singers and the laugh-choreography of Director Sven-Eric Bechtolf is as good as a classic sitcom. Were talking Seinfeld or Frasier here! As well, theres more than just farce on display, as the betrayal and heartbreak hidden beneath the cynical high spirits are beautifully conveyed by the four lovers.

Cosi fan Tutte is a great comedy-drama, the Mozart-da Ponte opera where drama wells up unexpectedly from a comic situation. The work is immensely enhanced by Mozarts contribution, with the stage drollery punctuated by clever asides from the orchestra, and the underlying serious nature of love conveyed by his gorgeous vocal lines and complex accompaniments. Conductor Christophe Eschenbach keeps the musical side of the production at the highest level. While I opened with extravagant praise for the acting skills of the soloists, thats not to say their singing is anything other than superb. One could with great pleasure listen to the very fine Dolby 5.0 audio by itself. But its nice to not have to close ones eyes, as one sometimes does in the opera house or in front of the flat screen at home, to focus on the singing and playing while trying to blot out whats happening on stage.",1444867200,2,2145,4.876712328767123
8717207,5,B00XZKQBJQ,"In August, 2013, the Salzburg Festival featured a performance of Mozart's opera ""Cosi fan Tutte"" at the Mozart Haus.  I wasn't there, alas; but I imagined myself as part of the large, elegantly-dressed audience in watching this live production on DVD in my home. Christoph  Escenbach conducts the Vienna Philharmonic in the first of a cycle directed by Sven-Eric  Becholf of the three operatic collaborations of Mozart and Lorenzo da Ponte. The cast consists of Gerald Finley as Don Alphonso, Malin Hartelius as Fiordigli, Luca Pisaroni as Guglielmo, Marie-Claude Chappuis as Dorabella, Martin Mitterrutzner as Ferrando, and Martina  Jankova as Despina.

This production of ""Cosi"" is beautifully staged in a large ariistocratic setting with elegant period costuming and furnishings. The gaiety and lightness of the production belong to the late eighteenth century while the undertone of some of the more troubling implications of Mozart and da Ponte's tale have a modern feel as well. The apparently worldly-wise Don Alphonso, whose machinations result in the unfaithfulness of the four young lovers, receives his comeuppance.  In Bechtolf's staging and accompanying liner notes, the opera becomes a story of the triumph of human passion over reason rather than the reverse.

The four young lovers are all well-cast in their roles and as the opera progresses sing with increasing depth and passion as each abandons his or her intended. Despina and Don Alphonso are cynical and crafty. Fiordigli, the young woman who most resists her fall, comes through with a nearly tragic force.  Eschenbach and the Vienna Philharmonic capture the shifting musical qualities and emotions of the score. The work moves from humor and cynicism in the opening act to love and emotion in the second act.

This DVD provides an  enchanting night at the opera.  The singing, playing, and acting are gorgeous in their portrayal of laughter, passion, and human frailty.  The DVD offers subtitles in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Japanese. The  performance  is on the Unitel Classica
label and distributed by Naxos.  Naxos kindly sent me a review copy.

..............................................................................................................................

This disc, recorded in 2013, preceded that of Don Giovanni, also recorded at Salzburg but in 2014, and with the same director and conductor.  Essentially it presents a largely traditional production and with an appropriately young cast as befits the general plot line. The orchestra is the VPO which plays with all the expected empathy and verve under excellent direction from Eschenbach.

The singers all have a secure command of the technical and musical requirements and work well as a team. This is opera is an ensemble piece without a particular star role being dominant. It is therefore important that the singers are able to match well vocally and to demonstrate dramatic empathy, if not sympathy, as the plot evolves.

Gerald Finley as Don Alfonso is as completely successful in this role as he was with the role of the Duke Almaviva at the Royal Opera in 2006. Luca Pisaroni reprises his role of Guglielmo taken at Glyndebourne, also in 2006. It is interesting to see connections of dramatic interpretive details as regards his responses to Ferrando retained for this later production.  Ferrando, taken by Martin Mitterrutzner makes a convincing pair with Pisaroni.

The three women are equally well portrayed and matched. Despina, taken by Martina Jankova, is particularly convincing in an energetic way and is a good match for the excellent Ainhoa Garmendia at Gyndebourne. Dorabella is well portrayed by Marie-Claude Chappuis especially as the performance progresses. The dramatically more demanding role of Fiordiligi is well taken by Malin Hartelius who expresses the greater dramatic distress of the part well even if she fails to match that of Miah Persson at Glyndebourne. Miah Persson simply has a greater range of tonal repose through her vocal range and uses this to great effect and to her advantage.

The production, as stated at the outset, is essentially a traditional one. The staging makes use of large potted trees behind which the three men regularly hide in order to overhear their fiances conversations and thoughts. This close proximity without discovery stretches credulity too far and may become tiresome for some viewers. It is not even necessary for some of the time as the plot does not always require such eave-droppings. It does not feature in this way at Glyndebourne which also has the advantage of a bigger stage with more space at its disposal.

A notable deviation from the original plot occurs at the very end when Don Alfonso unwittingly drinks a glass of poison poured out earlier by Guglielmo with Fiordiligi in mind. This same twist was adopted in the Welser-Most recording but in that case it was Fiordiligi who died. That was damagingly unacceptable as Fiordiligi was the innocent victim of machination and her death soured Mozarts intended ending. Alfonso could be seen as the perpetrator of general unhappiness and therefore more deserving of such an end. However, this was not what Mozart had in mind and may be resisted by potential purchasers of this recording.

As a recording this offers excellent visuals and orchestral sound. The vocal reproduction is generally well handled but the singing from the rear of the stage can be reticent in terms of balance compared to the more forward balance of the front of stage.  This is what the audience would hear of course and could be argued that it is more realistic. The differences can be accepted without too much effort although, for a recording, a slight boost to the rear of the stage singing might have been better for the home viewer even if less realistic.

In summary this can be counted as a successful and traditional version of the opera even if the ending is unconventional",1438041600,6,3934,5.169811320754717
