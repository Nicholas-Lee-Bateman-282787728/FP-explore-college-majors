2057059,5,B00022PZ1A,"Not quite as nice as seeing it in the original IMAX, but still an andrenaline rush.  The larger the screen, the better it will look.  I especially enjoyed seeing the SR-71 Blackbird and the view from the cockpit of the A-4 Skyhawk as the Blue Angels take off.  Glad this was still available...wasn't sure it would be after all these years.",1261785600,,339,4.524590163934426
2057060,5,B00022PZ1A,"This may be my favorite IMAX film. I saw it at a theatre and bought the DVD. It's basically about man's desire to go faster and faster. We see a crude bicycle, moving up through jets and splitting particles. Although it's educational it is very entertaining. The 40s hot rod was a great bit with good music and scenes. DVD quality was great, I have never had a problem with it.",1256601600,,377,4.323943661971831
2057061,3,B00022PZ1A,This is an old movie.  I certaintly wouldnt buy it as a standard watch film. It is cool though to show off an HD tv with the WMVHD format.,1186185600,,138,3.7586206896551726
2057062,5,B00022PZ1A,IN FACT THIS DVD SHOWS IN A BRILLIANT WAY THE EVOLUTION OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT SURROUNDS THE WILL OF THE MAN IN SEARCH OF BETTER MARKS OF SPEED IN ALL THE POSSIBLE AND IMAGINABLE MODALITIES. IN MY OPINION THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST MOMENTS OF THE HUMANITY.,1174521600,,280,4.30188679245283
2057063,5,B00022PZ1A,"This short film is superb as an introduction to the joys of High Definition Video.  With a big plasma screen and a good ""home-cinema""

set-up comprising multiple speakers,  you get even better than the

standard ""IMAX Experience"",  since most basic Imax theaters do

not screen the ""High-Def"" versions of Imax films (good,  but short of HD

standards!)",1170547200,,352,5.052631578947368
2057064,5,B00022PZ1A,Superb product. Can be viewed on a PC outside Region 1. A good sampler if wanting to know more about HD TV. I believe this comment applies to all the other IMAX derived WMVHD discs. Also worth watching on the DVD version if you can view Region 1 NTSC DVD's. A pretty good deal even allowing for postage from the States.,1140998400,,319,4.245901639344262
2057065,5,B00022PZ1A,"As with all the other HD IMAX titles, ""Speed"" is a fun ride.  The WMV High Definition quality is excellent, the story is engaging, and the production quality is top notch.",1103068800,4,171,4.516129032258065
2057066,5,B00022PZ1A,"Okay, let's face it. This film came out before my time. I wasn't around in 1982 to see this when it premiered in big screen theatres. I only managed to catch wind of it thanks to an old DOS Educational program from Knowledge Adventure that featured the film itself. But ever since I was little, this film has never failed to capture my imagination.

It is definitely a great experience for those who can manage to catch it on an IMAX big screen as I had the chance to in May, (In fact, I think the Ontario Place Cinesphere in Toronto is the only theatre in the world still showing this film!) but this film DEFINITELY lives up to its title.

It is a rather short lived film (as most IMAX films are, due to the limitations of the format, around 40 minutes) with this particular title weighing in at around 30 minutes. For the time that it does last, the movie takes you through a whirlwind of information about the history of speed, some of its various uses, and how the technology has progressed today. Tie it off with a nice 2001: A Space Odyssey like sequence about travelling faster than light, and you have yourself a not so detailed, but fun introduction to various forms of speed. The film bases its success widely on the variety of shots that it uses from aerial cameras with the Blue Angel Precision Flying Squadron, to the front of a rollercoaster.

An overall good film, but more suited to children around ages 8 and up.",1090368000,8,1430,4.429657794676806
8020999,2,B00022PZ1A,"for me, as a fan from gillivray-freeeman imax experiences, not the really best films, only one from the ""back-side"".",1495929600,,116,5.157894736842105

8021002,3,B00022PZ1A,"Like many others I purchased this because I saw it when I was younger and this was the only way I could see it again.  Even if I had known beforehand that the WMV HD disk was effectively a worthless coaster filled with undecryptable data I still would have purchased this.  There currently isn't any other option on Amazon.  That being said, it was very disappointing to find that the web site the WMV HD files need to get to in order to decrypt the DRM is no longer operational.  This is the only reason I gave this 3 stars.  The regular DVD disc works like normal so at least I was able to watch it in SD.  If I ever figure out a way to circumvent the DRM on the WMV HD disc I will write a comment to this review, but I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.",1487721600,,760,3.9671052631578947

8021005,5,B00022PZ1A,"I had the great fortune of seeing this when it was new and being shown at Great America in Santa Clara, CA. Look up ""Lockheed IMAX Pictorium Theater"" for more info, it was 65 feet tall by 89 feet wide, seeing this short film on that screen was an experience I'll never forget. I really hope it gets a Blu-Ray release some day, or 4K UHD!",1440547200,,337,4.121212121212121

8021008,2,B00022PZ1A,"I wanted to watch this as I first saw it at Imax in Flint back in 1984.  Subtitled movies weren't around back then and I had to depend on my relative to explain to me what was going on with the movie.

Fast forward 26.5 years later, Autoworld where this Imax theater used to be was demolished, one of my relative that came with me has long passed away, and my cousin that was with me went from wearing diaper to wearing bridal veil and getting married soon.

Also I find this movie has been released in DVD already and the feature included closed captioning so I decided to buy it. However when I got it and played it, there is NO CLOSED CAPTIONING ANYwHERE!! I have checked with Windows Media and it doesn't show caption or English subtitle on the DVD, nor with 720 and 1080 video on second disc.  The DVD case makes no mention of closed captioning or subtitling.  I checked it on my other computer and used variety of free DVD players. They either don't show Closed Captioning option or it shows as grayed out and not available on this DVD. No subtitle either.

Maybe there's more than 1 version of this video with the same UPC and same ISBN and I happened to get one without Closed Captioning. Since I have DVD with no Closed Captioning, the information Amazon provided stating this DVD has Closed Captioning is inaccurate and made me waste my money.",1303344000,,1353,4.413654618473895
