8646974,5,B00J0ARCDY,I think this is my second favorite Strauss opera just after Der Rosenkavalier. I think the 3rd act conclusion may be one of the most beautiful moments in opera history. And with Renee Fleming in her element one can ask for nothing better.,1456099200,3,238,4.558139534883721
8646975,5,B00J0ARCDY,"Capriccio is an unusual opera in that it asks the question, Which is more important, the music or the words/poetry? and gives the audience much to think about as the subject of the opera is the creation of an opera  itself, as it turns out.  And this allows Strauss to both poke fun at the notion that each is more important (as is evidenced by the dialog between the various characters), while at the same time showing the importance of the combination of the two.  The crux of the issue is spoken to by the Countess (Renee Fleming), who seemingly must choose between the affections of a poet and a composer  and what transpires is that she asks them to work together on an opera (i.e. this one!) with the ending (and preference between words and music) to be decided by the Countess herself.  Kurt Rydl also deserves special mention as La Roche, the Theatre Director who feels that the staging and other actors are the most important things that bring the writer/composers creations to life.  His performance is delightful.

The Countess, however, does not wish to choose between the two men, as she cares for them both and does not with to lose either.  Ms. Fleming is simply one of the best at embodying this potential sense of loss and longing  and one cannot say enough about her ability to take the opera goer on an emotional journey that is genuine and heartfelt, longing and wistful, and filled with beautifully sung melodies.  And there is something about the music of Strauss that she brings to life in a very special way

The image quality of this Blu-ray recording is astonishing  every detail of the intricate costuming can be seen, and the visible subtle nuances of the expressions of the performers greatly adds to the overall enjoyment of the performance.  The Wiener Staatsoper, under the baton of Christoph Eschenbach, delivers beautiful music and a marvelous launch pad for the each of the singers to deliver their best from.  I found this disc enjoyable from start to finish, and wish I could have seen this particular performance in person.  I very much recommend this disc.",1409529600,6,2096,4.71978021978022
