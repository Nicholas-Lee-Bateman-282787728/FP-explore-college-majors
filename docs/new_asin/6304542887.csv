897208,2,6304542887,"I actually bought this film without seeing it first, so overwhelmingly positive were most of the other reviews found here.  After watching about the first 15 minutes, both my fiancee and I were asking ourselves, ""How could ANYONE think this film is good?"" This is one of the WORST films I've ever watched. The opening sequence is great, but the rest of film moved at a snail's pace and the plot was absolutely pointless.  Yes, Mulcahy's style is great as in his other films, but he should have become a Director of Photography, NOT a director of people.  While Dolph is as good as Dolph typically gets in a film, the other actors were grade Z cast-offs (although it was fun to see 'Psycho' from ""Stripes"" working again, as a security guard), who delivered their lines as if they had memorized them five minutes before shooting.  There is BARELY ANY ACTION during the remainder of the film, and the flashback sequences show a plot which is just as lame as the story currently unfolding.  The female lead was simply not believable as a sniper.  I don't know how anybody was able to receive financing to film so stupid a story, but I guess the direct-to-DVD trade is only interested in making a profit of $-- the same amount of money I paid for this film at Wal-mart.  I was very disappointed, because I was all set to see a great Lundgren movie -- and I'm even madder at all the Amazon.com reviewers who whet my appetite with their great reviews.  Jean-Claude Van Damme's newest flick, 'Derailed,' is even better than this piece of ... -- and I HATED that movie.",1044921600,2,1560,4.546428571428572

However, I have a question? Why Dolph always disobeys his order and unable to accomplsih his assignment. And why the Agency keeps on assigning him to complete sensitive mission. It is really very risky.",1038182400,,365,4.809523809523809

897211,2,6304542887,The DVD is not up to the same standards as the VHS tape. It is shorter and is only pan and scan. Usually movies for rental are P&S.

897212,5,6304542887,"I thought that this movie was pretty good.  Maybe it's because of the .50 cal, or because its about a sniper.  That'd make a good action movie right there, but at the same time its typical for movies of this genre to have big weapons, big explosions, and _no_ plot.  The hero who shoots everything that moves, and doesn't ever even think twice about it.  You occasionally will find one where their buddy will get shot, so they cry for a scene, and go back on the rampage again.  Silent Trigger, although it does have action scene typical to the genre, focuses more on the other aspect.  It actually conveys meaning.  Behind all the action scenes the plot focuses on his inability to see the targets as targets anymore, but as human beings.  Unable to objectify the person on the other end of his rifle, he loses the ability to pull the trigger.
The plot itself was done nicely as well.  It goes back and forth between two different missions, both of which end up the same.  However, some of the turns the plot takes are pretty obvious.  The only dissappointments I had were the DVD version doesn't have any extra footage, and I can't seem to figure out where the alternate camera angles are available.  Despite this, however, it still makes a good movie which can be watched over again.",1012694400,,1286,4.51948051948052

It looks very artsy. The movie is about an assassin (Dolph) who used to be the best in the business but is growing weary of his profession. If you like Dolph, he looks really good in this film and his acting isn't bad. He does deliver one boring monologue that you should just skip, and the girl in the film (Gina Bellman) has an annoying voice. However, the action scenes are good and the film just looks SLICK.

897786,3,6304542887,"Silent Trigger (1996) is a slick film that starts out with some promise, shrouds what it is really about for a while as it builds up some tension, and then erodes into complete silliness.

Many times, Dolph Lundgren has played characters with depth that is paper thin, and this role another, as Lundgren plays a sniper who is part of an organization that engages in assassination.  Proper names are avoided, as Lundgren is the ""Shooter"", while Gina Beeman (Leverage) is similarly billed as ""Spotter"" for the task that her character performs.  The film opens crisply, with the Shooter and Spotter high up in a tower, preparing to assassinate a politician.  On her first mission, the Spotter provides information regarding range and the prevailing winds.  The target arrives, and mission control orders the Shooter to fire, but he refuses.  A chopper suddenly appears out of nowhere, opens fire on the tower, and drops soldiers down to the ground on ropes to attack.  Utilizing a 50 caliber sniper rifle, the Shooter downs the chopper in a nicely executed action sequence, and escapes with the Spotter.

The film cuts away from this adventure, and proceeds to a new mission set at an unfinished building, in an unnamed city.  The situation makes almost no sense, as most of the spaces in the Algonquin tower are unfinished with open exterior walls, yet there is electrical power in some areas, including building security, located on the ground floor.  Two security guards are on duty, when the Spotter arrives in the rain, posing as a tech hired to work on computers located in the penthouse (really?).  In the elevator, she has to pull a gun, to fend off the advances of O'Hara (Christopher Heyerdahl), a guard high on cocaine.  Unknown to the Spotter, the Shooter has already entered the building, and is waiting for her in the penthouse.

The reunion is unexpected, but the two professionals take things in stride.  What happened in the original mission is slowly revealed in a series of flashbacks.  While preparing for the new assignment, their main concerns are the other guard (Conrad Dunn), and an agitated O'Hara, who returns with the intention of taking revenge on the Spotter.

Silent Trigger gets off to an exciting start, but begins to spiral down to a crash landing, once events begin to unfold in the Algonquin.  When a screenplay features the likes of O'Hara as the primary threat, you have a major problem.  The Shooter is supposed to be a pro, but sadly he proves to be quite inept, as the drug crazed nut gives him all he can handle.  Then instead of putting him out of commission, the Shooter handcuffs him to a toilet fixture, which then becomes a gag.

The rest of the story is riddled with abject silliness, sure to disappoint anyone seeking some semblance of a credible plot.  Much of the action centers around the building's elevator.  Defying logic, the elevator shaft does not have a consistent look, as it actually changes its physical structure between various scenes.  What a mess!  This is another film with lighting in the elevator shaft, and the raised floor in the penthouse, also has lighting beneath it.  Cinematic perhaps, but like much in the film, utter drivel.

Reflecting on the life they have chosen, the Spotter and Shooter find that they have feelings for each other, making love on the floor of the drafty penthouse.  Leaking water leads to the discovery that O'Hara has escaped, but upon returning to the penthouse, the once flooded corridor is now miraculously dry.  So much for continuity.  With O'Hara a threat to jeopardize the top secret mission, the Shooter does very little but relax.  With a sense of dj vu, the pair prepare to make the hit, and once again things do not go as planned.  As before, men suddenly drop down from above, setting the stage for a clumsily executed shootout.

Gina Bellman is a step up in class, from the leading ladies typically appearing in Lundgren's films.  Her character could have had a more substantial role, but is mainly around for eye candy.  Often with damp hair, she spends much of the time as a damsel in distress, taking some heavy duty abuse.  She still manages to look damn good, and finally kicks some ass at the climax, but winds up soaking wet again, in a throwaway ending.  Somehow, Dolph Lundgren usually manages to come off as likeable onscreen, even though at times, as in this film, it seems like he isn't making the greatest effort.

Unfortunately, even an inspired Lundgren performance, could not overcome the ridiculously bad screenplay.  Director Russel Mulcahy (Highlander) delivers a few tight action scenes, but the less than cogent plot, dooms what could have been a solid action adventure told in an interesting way.  The film does entertain, but loses touch with reality early on, and sadly drifts away into pure nonsense.  This is an outing where the Shooter never completes his mission, and his massive gun (the one used for sniping), is not employed as intended.",1293840000,,4978,4.83806146572104
897891,3,6304542887,"When a Dolph Lundgren DVD review starts with the words ""not a bad movie"", you know you must RUSH and buy it, for it's as good as it's gonna get! The fact that I am still a fan of the actor is testament to his vast on-screen charisma rather then his ability (luck?) to pick winning projects.

Well, this is not a bad movie...Waxman is a battle-hardened sniper, working for a non-descript agency, when his moral consciousness comes a knocking, inconveniently, in the middle of an assignement, while he is being assisted by a rookie spotter (the lovely Gina Bellman; check her out in ""Couplings""). We hope he's been told to kill whoever hired the girl, for she has no clue (though looks good in tight clothing). Things go from bad to worse and the couple end up running for their lives thru a war torn country. We see them again re-united a few years later, on another assignement (Waxman's moral conciousness must have taken another break during that time). The job takes them to the top floor of an eery apartment building, still under construction. All is not what it seems though. Neither one trusts the other. The girl makes it clear she is ready to ""retire"" Waxman, should he fail to complete his job this time. And so, obviously,... they have sex (well, research does seem to support the notion that people who have sex during work time are happier in their employment; so, who are we to judge?). High action events take place that derail both characters and lead to a climax that is unexpected to the viewer. Not bad...Really...

All the scenes for the second assignement are shot in the beautifully eery Algonquin Hotel in Montreal, Canada. The location heightens the feeling of isolation the two heroes experience; it sets the mood and works well to support the script, the story, and the character development. However, it is the manner in which the first assignement is shot that makes me knock down two stars off the rating. Naive set set-up, undisciplined and unenthused extras are just a couple of the issues. Unfortunately, we see these poorly produced scenes thruthout the entire movie, in form of flashbacks. With the $10-$15 mil budget these scenes have no right to be there...plain and simple. By contrast, Lundgren's ""Retrograde"" was shot for less then $2 mil, but with a more believable result! The end product is uneven, frustrating the viewer with its unrealized potential.

Still, there is enough good action and decent acting on part of Lundgren and Bellman, to make this one of my favourite Dolph movies. When I fast forward thru all the flashbacks, I can almost get the feeling of watching a major motion picture. Not a small feat for a Dolph movie to achieve...",1245024000,2,2687,4.737179487179487
897892,4,6304542887,"Dolph Lundgrens 1996 vehicle here is a pretty unique production. A 90s action-thriller with heavy existentialist aspirations, the feature manages to attain most of its ambitions via the surprisingly careful touch of director Russell Mulcahy. Its got some problems that threaten my rating and may limit it to a niche audience, but for the most part, this is a successful experiment the likes of which Lundgren has yet to reproduce.

The story: A mysterious sniper (Lundgren,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Expendables/dp/B002ZG999U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Expendables</a>&nbsp;trilogy) and his spotter (Gina Bellman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leverage/dp/B001OQCVCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leverage</a>) face a series of internal and external threats as they prepare to eliminate a target from an unfinished high-rise building.

From a thematic standpoint, this is an extremely ambitious effort for an action movie starring a performer best known for punching people. The first time I saw it, I thought of how easily this could have been turned into a play. There are only four prominent cast members, all generally inhabiting a single location, and there is an emphasis on character scenes with few action highlights. Sergio Altieris (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blind-Fear/dp/B00008G84V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blind Fear</a>) screenplay mixes a typical action premise with heavy doses of noir and a touch of absurdity, creating a micro-world wherein alien codes of conduct are natural and the namelessness of characters is taken for granted. Though Russell Mulcahy can be a heavy-handed director, hes very in tune with Altieris story and manages to create a tense, intimate atmosphere thats oftentimes more chilling than his attempts at horror have been. There are some lapses and excesses to this moody atmosphere, but for the most part, the filmmakers are very successful at striking the tone they want.

The one major qualm I personally have with the picture is its treatment of Gina Bellmans character, which makes painfully clear that this is a movie written by men and for men. Bellmans talent shines through even in the most indignant of situations, but aside from the usual tropes of turning a highly-trained female operative into a damsel and a random sex scene, its a challenge to find any statements or actions the character makes that aren't in some way critiqued by her male counterparts.

The action content is measured. Its pretty sparse, but whats there tends to adrenalize. The worst of these scenes is the single brawl that Lundgren had with sadistic coke-fiend Christopher Heyerdahl (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sanctuary/dp/B008I34Z34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sanctuary</a>), but the best scenes involve the use of Lundgrens unique sniper rifle. Two major shootouts compose the highlights of the action, and Lundgrens weapon of choice  with its immensely powerful bullets but agonizingly slow rate of fire  gives these scenes a unique pace that you don't get when both sides of a firefight are blazing away with automatic weapons. The uneven nature of these gunfights, combined with their infrequency, may understandably leave some action fans unfulfilled, particularly if the story is not to their liking either. Essentially, this is an action movie that asks you to take a chance on something other than the strength of its action, and if youd rather spend your time on less of a gamble, Lundgren has an entire library of other flicks to check out.

Personally, I had a good time with this one. The fact that the star has not attempted to make another film along these lines is a little disappointing, since Lundgren does well with the minimalist touch. Nevertheless, this helps make Silent Trigger something of a hidden gem, and if nothing else, the strength of its production places it on the list of high-end offerings among Lundgrens non-theatrical features.",1238112000,4,4082,5.8504201680672265

897894,5,6304542887,"I started to look out for Dolph Lundgren films after I saw this one. But it is my feeling that none other is better than Silent Trigger. Very stylish, very moody, overacted in a grand way.",1185840000,2,188,4.25
897895,3,6304542887,"I tend to have a fairly poor opinion of movies of this sort, meaning inconsequential action movies. This category would include the films of Steven Segal, Jean-Claude van Damme, Sly Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the like. With a few notable exceptions (""The Terminator,"" for example) these are forgettable time fillers. I was aware Dolph Lundgren made action movies, though I always associate him with his role as the Russian behemoth from ""Rocky IV."" Little did I realize he is Swedish, not Russian (the name should have been my first clue), is a martial artist and he is reputedly very intelligent; he holds a master's degree in chemical engineering and had a Fulbright Scholarship to go to MIT. Needless to say, I have newfound respect for Mr. Lundgren. Unfortunately, high intelligence does not necessarily always translate into great films. Such is the case with ""Silent Trigger,"" a mostly forgettable tale about an assassin (Lundgren), who has an epiphany, decides he is the bad guy and refuses to shoot a high-profile target. This leads his spotter (played by the marvelous Gina Bellman) to be ordered to dispose of him. We jump forward to another opportunity for assassination, where Shooter and Spotter again encounter one another. I am impressed by some of the cinematography, and the understated, dark atmosphere sometimes resembles a horror or suspense film. The violence is quite bloody and strong in this, which is something to which I am not very accustomed. I primarily watched this to see Gina Bellman, who is so good as Jane on ""Coupling."" Her physically demanding role here as an assassin is much different, though she is just as likeable. Does Dolph choose roles that do not require him to emote, or is he typecast in these roles? Either way, there isn't much opportunity for him to show his chops here, though we don't go into this film expectin4g as much. The finale is rather satisfying, so I would recommend if you are in the mood for a half-way decent action flick. The DVD offers a good transfer and a few different audio and subtitle options. It is also full screen pan-and-scan, which seems fitting for the caliber of the film.",1172620800,4,2162,4.909836065573771
897896,1,6304542887,"Dolph Lundgren (Universal Soldier, Blackjack) plays a man who is hired to take out a primary target and helping him is his old partner, Gina Bellman. Soon things heat up as the two security guards working at the building they are at start to get fiesty and one of them takes drugs and sees spiders and stuff. The 2 are also in a heated romance and get caught in a deadly cat and mouse game of double cross as the agency they are working for want them dead. Another Dolph Lundgren stinker vehicle though Lundgren can't act if his life depended on it. He couldn't pull of He-Man and The Punisher, he can't pull off anything else. Gina Bellman is hot but her acting is horrible as well as the rest of the cast. There's nothing like being hired to kill people and then have sex. Directed by Russell Mulcahy (Highlander). Bottom line is this actioner is a borefest.",1100908800,,860,4.415094339622642
897897,5,6304542887,"Silent Trigger is a solid movie, it's two main charecters are complete with their own personalities. In the begining Clegg ""Gina Bellman"" is a rookie spotter for ""the agency"" but a few years later ""big fast forward"" she is a highly experienced woman. Keep in mind folks, that Gina Bellman is a stuningly gourgeous female and in this movie she looks absolutly stunning. Plus she carries a gun and wears tight black clothing so the eye candy aspect of the movie is deffiantly there. Dolph Lungren is a great action movie actor ""even though in real life he doesn't really like being an action charecter"". This movie shows the other side of him that you don't see much of in other movies. In this movie he starts questioning his profesion and why he works as an assasin. Clegg also wonders why they are assasins as well. The diologe is great in this movie, Gina Bellmans diologe supports the personality she has, ""Strong, Sassy, Sexy"" *pefect woman heh?* lol. In real life both Dolph Lungren and Gina Bellman are really cool people who are passionate about acting so thats always a good to know. The movie doesn't get boring at all unlike countless hundreds of Hollywood ""blockbuster"" movies that just plain sucks. Silent Trigger is one of those movies that doesn't get boring after the 4th time watching it. Everytime I watch it I pick up on something different, it has real life themes scattered in the movie and great action scenes and this great film will get you thinking, guarenteed! I'm praying for a ""Silent Trigger 2"" to someday be released.",1069027200,11,1546,4.708487084870849
897898,3,6304542887,"Silent Trigger, especially during its opening sequences and several flashback episodes, shows clearly the handy work and influence of director Russel Mulcahy of ""Highlander"" lore.
For anybody expecting a fast-paced action movie, this film should not be their first choice. If, however, one is interested in a personality study of the relationship between a rookie spotter and an experienced sniper, and how this may be affected by their employer, ""the Agency"", the viewer is in for a treat.
While this picture includes some action scenes, the plot is overall developed at a rather slow pace.
It seems unfortunate, however, that the studio did not include the original cinematic wide-screen on this DVD, and provides only the standard full-screen cut, which proves to be a real boon for panoramic scenes, as well as several of the action scenes in which a good part of the action happens off-screen or on the perimeter.
From the looks of it the studio also omitted a few scenes, rendering the DVD shorter than the original feature length.
While this motion picture is a must-see for any Dolph Lundgren fan, all viewers would be better served if the studio would finally elect to release a full-featured wide-screen version of this movie.",1063929600,2,1236,5.034146341463415
897899,3,6304542887,"Overall, I'd have to say this film is just Okay. The gunplay scenes are quite good, with Dolph's .50 caliber sniper rifle doing the job quite well. I'd have to say that the film's plot left a little to be desired. I constantly felt like I was waiting for something to happen, but it never did.
Dolph plays a sniper working with his spotter on an assignment. When Dolph refuses to 'take the shot' when instructed to do so, the mission controller orders that they pair be executed. On the run, they both meet up for another mission, and find that this time, it's them who's being hunted.
The acting is about par for Lundgren. I don't see him winning any academy awards, but he's better than some I've seen. The fight scenes and gun scenes are really what drew me to this film. If you can get past a lack of plot, just to watch some mindless shooting, you'll love it. Otherwise, you'd probably give it the same rating I did.",1053561600,,921,4.3604651162790695
