There are many, many excellent books and DVDs about equines.  This is most certainly not one of them.

8128086,1,B000FZEN5S,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas and was very disapointed. We use many natural horsemanship methods with our herd, but this DVD was all wrong. I do not recommend this to anyone.

Natural does not mean ""no care, no deworming and no hoofcare"". I would not follow this DVD's advise with my animals.",1172620800,2,305,4.545454545454546
8128087,5,B000FZEN5S,"I got this as a Christmas present.  Didn't know what to expect.  I liked it.  At least Tim Ware's not just another guy dressed up as a cowboy saying the same old things.  What he said really made me think.  It's stuff I knew but never really thought about in that way.  Those who are stuck in their own ways won't like it, but those with open minds and wanting to learn will.",1169596800,,375,4.068493150684931
8128088,1,B000FZEN5S,"I was merely disappointed by the lack of anything interesting in this video until I got half way through it when he started talking about vaccines and deworming - then I became absolutely horrified and disgusted.  This man actually thinks that horses kept in boarding stable situations do not need regular deworming or vaccinations!  It's obvious that he belongs to the crowd that believes horses should not be kept by humans unless they can roam on land big enough for them to get a natural diet, natural water, etc.  Well, down here on planet Earth, it doesn't always work that way.

Go ahead and get this video if you want to watch some guy, standing in a field, droning on and on about how everything you do with your horse should be done the ""natural"" way - and if you don't, then you just don't understand horses.  Oh, and by the way, if you don't vaccinate or deworm your horse and he gets sick and dies, that's just nature's way of telling you that your horse wasn't strong enough to live.  You think I'm exaggerating?  Get that video and see for yourself.",1168128000,6,1064,4.510416666666667
8128089,5,B000FZEN5S,"Tim Ware obviously has an affinity for horses and his thoughts on understanding our equine companions reflect this.

This video offers valuable insights into how we might provide a better environment for our horses and as a result improve their well-being and health. The concepts are presented in a clear and easy to understand way from a unique perspective.

There is a companion video Understanding the Hoof, which I would recommend watching first. It goes into more detail about Mr. Ware and his background and provides a most informative look at the basic structure of the horse. It provides a strong context for this video as a follow up.

I recommend buying both and starting with the hoof.",1153526400,6,697,4.889830508474576
