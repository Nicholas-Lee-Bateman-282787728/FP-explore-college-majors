6679667,5,B00NT9641I,"One of my favorite love stories, it has me cracking up constantly; I'm so happy this came out! Naoki sums up the series well when he says (rough quote): ""I can do 99% of everything that needs to be done, but the other 1% only Kotoko can do."" Naoki is a guy who never has to try at anything - until Kotoko (which is why he comes to love her); Kotoko is a girl who has to try with all her might - usually to fail, but sometimes ...sometimes she pulls off a miracle that astonishes even him. It is nice to see too how she is the only girl able to win his affection (though she still gets jealous), no other girl even comes close. This animated version is the only one I like; the sub version for me was enjoyable, so it is unlikely I would get a dub even if it came out (sometimes I like one or the other) - ignore the purists on both sides and GET THIS SHOW!!!",1418688000,12,858,3.9367816091954024
6679668,5,B00NT9641I,"Itazura na Kiss is one of my all time favorites and am glad to finally own it!  The quality is great and the subs are easy to read (no white text on light backgrounds, well timed, good translation).  The only issue is Amazon claimed it to be English dubbed,  which it is not.  I don't care, as I prefer subs.  Don't let that stop you, this series is wonderful!  It also ends as the author (Kaoru Tada) had planned, as the original manga was never completed after her untimely death.",1418342400,5,482,4.3

What happen with it being dubbed in English

6679671,4,B00NT9641I,"This is a romantic comedy anime based on the Itazura na Kiss manga.  I will give a summary since there is not one on this listing.

This anime follows a high school girl named Kotoko.  Kotoko finally gets the courage to tell handsome and talented senior Naoki that she has been in love with him since the first day of school.  However, he rejects her promptly.  Fate has other ideas.  An earthquake destroys Kotoko's house and her father tells her they are going to move in with his childhood friend, who happens to be the father of Naoki...The story follows Kotoko and Naoki's comedic love story.  This is all based on the Japanese version, however the plot will not change.  Once I see the dubbed version, I will update based on that, but I thought it would help others know what this anime is about.",1416268800,24,802,4.482758620689655

6679677,5,B00NT9641I,"I don't watch many anime that are subtitled, but I am glad that I chose to watch this one.  It is one of the best I've seen.  If you like romance anime, and ones that don't end while the characters are still finding their way through high school, then I recommend this one.",1432080000,3,273,4.132075471698113

6679680,5,B00NT9641I,"Itakiss is a hilarious and intelligently write anime series based on the classic manga ""itazura na kiss"" by Kaoru Tada. This anime is the story of silly girl Kotoko who falls for the most successful and popular guy at her high school, in this case the very arrogant Naoki. While this formula has been used on countless anime and mangas before it the smart writing and sometimes crazy but plausible situations that make this so much fun to watch. While some comedies tend to get a bit over the top Itakiss always pulls itself back from its crazy situations and keeps the story moving. The background characters really drive the show, being fleshed out characters themselves. Kotoko's friends are hardly over achievers themselves and often speak honestly about their goals in life. Kotoko is the dreamer though and they never stop to hinder her aspirations, just gently remind her of the consequences.

Diskotek have released the entire series (25 episodes!)  as Japanese with English subtitles only. This is an easy recommendation.",1421625600,7,1030,5.017543859649122
6679681,5,B00NT9641I,"If you like funny, romantic, slice-of-life anime, then look mo further! Itazura na Kiss is an instant classic, and a staple in the ""dumb girl falls for elite guy"" trope.

There is a lot of well written romance in this series (which you don't see a lot of in anime). In my opinion, very few newer anime of the same genre come close to the endearing charm and writing that ItaKiss manages to pull off.

Be warned, however--this is not an original release by the studio/publisher from which this gem originates. It is, most definitely, a bootlegged copy. But do not let that discourage you, as everything from the housing of the discs to the quality of the translation for the subtitles is all very fine and well.

I have seen various bootlegged copies of this come out from time to time, but I had to wait a year for this to come back around after the last one went out of stock. If you think this is a series you might want (one deserving a place on any collector's shelf), buy it sooner rather than later so you can save yourself from waiting wondering if it will ever come back like I had to!

I highly recommend this anime for those interested in the genre. One of my personal favorites.",1420070400,4,1189,4.366515837104072
8680019,5,B00NT9641I,"Adorable this is the anime that we all wish we could see all the time... to many anime only give us a glimpse of their ""anime lives"", we don't get to see if they end up together or have kids that sort of thing. this takes you through their lives, struggles, love, marriage and kids. Really shows you the whole story. Great romantic film.",1530057600,,337,4.28125

8680021,4,B00NT9641I,"I actually watched this a few years ago, found the DVD set cleaning up, watched it again-- it is a good story, a few too many cliches, but entertaining without being pandering.  Girl sees boy so far out of her league it is absurd, so she uses five years to finally catch him, and the story is strangely compelling to watch.",1525564800,,323,4.295081967213115

8680023,5,B00NT9641I,"I went into this series knowing very little about it (just wanting to watch something new). While it begins with standard shojo tropes (high school romcom) what sets it apart is the ambitious scope of the story - we literally follow these characters from high school to college and into their professions (both working in a medical field). This gives the story room to explore plots we don't usually get to see in shojo romances from things like a honeymoon episode to following the main character's pregnancy. It is also unique in its very respectful portrayal of sex (which is portrayed only in tasteful, consensual settings after marriage). I think this is the only time I've seen this topic handled so respectfully in a shojo series and I found it refreshing. While the male lead's grumpiness and the female lead's immaturity can be annoying, they are not unlikeable. The funniest character, by far, is the male lead's mother, who takes things to extremes in trying to get the two leads together, going so far as dressing up in disguises and following them around.
If you're getting tired of high school romcoms that follow the same formula (beach episode, culture fair episode, etc, etc) and perhaps if you're an older anime fan that's long completed high school, this series is worth checking out.",1507593600,2,1303,4.873873873873874
8680024,5,B00NT9641I,"Kotoko is in love with the school's smartest guy Naoki and finally decides to confess her love to him, when she tries to hand him her love letter he just refused to take it.. things got even worse that night after an earthquake destroyed her own house so she had to move with her father to his friend's house.. that friend is actually Naoki's father and so they both now live under the same roof..

the special thing about this anime is that the story won't just end at high school, it will keep going up until after college life and marriage~ all in just 25 episodes.. a good family show for anyone.

only Japanese Audio with English Subs.",1495584000,3,640,4.369747899159663
