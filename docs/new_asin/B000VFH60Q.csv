8218554,5,B000VFH60Q,"A very funny little movie. Totally under the radar, but I'm glad I got a chance to see it. Two stoner college students decide to become hitmen... it's got weed, naked women, some very funny characters (the guy playing the Italian had me rolling on the floor). Definitely worth checking out.",1199577600,3,290,4.705882352941177
8218555,4,B000VFH60Q,"I have a friend who is involved in this film, so I could be bias here.  But I saw the movie and thought it was hilarious. Obviously, low budget films can go either way.  This one is sort of like the Owen and Luke Wilson classic ""Bottle Rocket"" meets the ""Bill and Ted"" series with Keanu Reeves.  It's a funny film and was shot surprisingly well for a film with no stars.  The characters are very funny and they don't just rely on any one person to generate humor.  The acting isn't perfect, but it's very good a times and I think people will really find this small gem funny.  I definitely recommend this movie.  It's not going to be the next ""Animal House"", but in a world of annoying big budget films that never fill expectations and too many small pretenders, this is a nice balance for film fans who don't need stars to enjoy a film.

The film is a straight-to-DVD release here.  I can't get my copy from Amazon until the week after it becomes available (the 13th of November is its US DVD release).  But after seeing it once, I'm excited to see it again.  Check it out.  You won't be blown away, but you'll be able to enjoy this film more then once.  Solid comedy with some heart, but more importantly, a good overall job of filmmaking.",1189728000,2,1241,4.297413793103448
