4498961,4,B004YCKK28,"Let's get the bad part of this release out first.  I could overlook the sticker on the booklet(that must have corrected a misprint that Nozomi Entertainment had made), but there was a HUGE mistake on the DVDs themselves. When you play the discs(all three of them), the menus say ""Student Council Saga"" in the background.  The episodes themselves are still the correct ones, but the menus are obviously not.  Usually, Nozomi's anime releases are top notch and error free, so this was kind of a shock.  Hopefully they will be more careful with the third set.

The video quality of this remastered release is as good as on the first set.  The extras are awesome as well. :)
My favorites were definitely the interview with Kunihiko Ikuhara, and the booklet.  The booklet is full of stuff that a Utena fan(atic) will find interesting.  The artwork section is bigger this time(there's both a ""Character Art Gallery"" and a ""Key Art Gallery"" included), and is full of promo images,sketches,etc.  My favorite article in the booklet was the ""Roses & Blood: Utena's Art Style"" article, which is all about the style and meaning of art in Utena.  Plus, the  laserdisc liner notes in the booklet included a good 4 page interview with Chiho Saito.  Her reaction to first meeting Kunihiko Ikurara was priceless.

So, even though there are a couple of mistakes in this set, it's still worth to get, whether you're a first time buyer or upgrading from the old Central Park Media releases.",1313193600,6,1470,4.785714285714286
4498962,4,B004YCKK28,"The second set of Nozomi's release of Revolutionary Girl Utena is just as good as the first. The video quality is superb, having used the recent Japanese remaster as its source. Lines and colors appear crisp. Motion is fluid and not choppy. The audio is also fantastic. The voices are clear. The music sounds especially beautiful in 5.1.

The case is a solid box with three thinpak DVD cases and a book inside.

Much like with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revolutionary-Girl-Utena-Student-Council-Saga-Limited-Edition-Set/dp/B004S7G6A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revolutionary Girl Utena: Student Council Saga Limited Edition Set</a>, my only real complaint is the artwork used for the individual thinpaks and the menus. I understand that Nozomi was trying to make the cases look classy, and for the most part, they succeed. I'm just a little disappointed with the thoughtless rehashing of old and somewhat mediocre artwork. The outer box features two of the twelve beautiful images done for the Japanese Utena releases. I had hoped that they would have kept this theme for the entire set. I would have loved to have seen all 12 of those images printed for the US releases. Alas, that was not the case. The artwork on the cases is honestly the only reason this set didn't get five stars.

This three-disc set features a large amount of special features:

Disc 01:
Animated Art Boards, Part 1: (28:15) This is a slide show of different location and background shots used throughout the series set to music. If you find the art of Utena at all appealing, this is a great feature.

Japanese Utena Promo (1997): (00:31) A short commercial for the Utena series that aired around the time the Black Rose Saga was beginning. Subtitled.

Nozomi Trailers for Aria: The Animation and Maria Watches Over Us season one.

Disc 02:
Interview with Director Kunihiko Ikuhara Part 01 (02:29) and Part 02 (02:56): Interviews with the director of Utena from Big Apple Anime Fest.

Nozomi Trailers for Antique Bakery and His and Her Circumstances.

Disc 03:
Interview with Director Kunihiko Ikuhara Part 03 (03:12) and Part 04 (04:53): Continuation of the interview with Utena's director from Big Apple Anime Fest.

Nozomi Trailers for Boys Be... and El-Hazard - The Wanderers.

The booklet that is included with The Black Rose Saga is thicker than the one included in the first set. It includes:

Director Episode Commentary
The Art of Shichiro Kobayashi, Art Director Interview
The Two Be-Papas: The Making of Be-Papas Studio, Part 1
Shinya Hasegawa, Character Designer Interview
Character Art Gallery
Rose and Blood: Utena's Art Style
Key Art Gallery
Laserdisc Liner Notes from the Japanese Archives

Odd thing about this booklet, and it may just be the first print, but the cover has a sticker over part of it. It's as if the booklet was misprinted with the wrong title and they had to add The Black Rose Saga to it quickly. Hmm

Overall, Nozomi has produced yet another great Utena set. If you're a fan of Utena and you're looking to get the series, these Nozomi sets are certainly the way to do it.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revolutionary-Girl-Utena-Student-Council-Saga-Limited-Edition-Set/dp/B004S7G6A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revolutionary Girl Utena: Student Council Saga Limited Edition Set</a>&nbsp;is the first set.

4498964,3,B004YCKK28,"Ok I have never liked Utena, and never will. The animation detail is abominable to say the least. When I first watched it I was optimistic. Into the first episode half an hour later I was annoyed beyond belief. I have not received this DVD set but I do enjoy looking at the covers of the cases and that is the only reason I reviewed it at a 3. I cannot understand the plot, and truthfully I do not wish to anymore that is how upset I still am over this anime. Please give me one good reason why I would willingly buy the DVD collection when all I have seen of it is just plain annoying?",1384041600,,586,4.017094017094017
4498965,5,B004YCKK28,"This box set corresponds to the Black Rose saga of the story.  The packaging features beautiful artwork (don't forget there is another piece of art on the back of the box; it's hidden under a promotional flyer!) and a booklet with interviews and series information. The show: the video is much more crisp than the previous release; the colors are wonderfully vibrant.  Some elements were retouched or re-drawn, and a noticeable addition involves what's inside the coffins in the basement of Nemuro Hall!  The Dolby 5.1 audio is much appreciated, especially in scenes featuring music, environmental sound effects, and the duels.",1382400000,,627,5.188118811881188
4498966,5,B004YCKK28,"This series benefited so much from the touchups. The sound is crisp and clear, the colors are vivid even beyond the original. It's almost like pushing the quality and detail up to the same level as the movie, the colors are so intense.",1379030400,,235,4.488372093023256

4498968,5,B004YCKK28,"And Mysterious.
This was my first real anime (besides David the Gnome and the childrens' anime-type shows.) It fits the bill of your typical anime by being a mental intrigue, a simultaneous firework of imagination, and a spectacle of artistry.

I wish it was a little more hi-def, as I have an 80-inch HD tv.",1374624000,,308,4.6
4498969,4,B004YCKK28,"The Utena Anime continues and in this new arc things just get more intriguing as we delve into new mysteries and reflect on the meanings behind each of the episodes, and the sub-plots which all are culminating together to build this world that Utena lives in and the upcoming events to unfold and mysteries to be revealed in the final arc.",1373760000,,339,4.573770491803279

4498971,5,B004YCKK28,"Just love this series!! Slowly completing this collection!!

The themes get darker in this boxset. Be ready for some creepy and straight up bizarre episodes. Theres a couple fillers that are just out there. But over all great anime and not one for children lol",1366502400,,260,4.777777777777778
4498972,4,B004YCKK28,"Please prepare for potential spoilers. I just cannot write this review without one or two, otherwise the whole thing won't make a lick of sense.  No more than that though...

Well, if you've read my review of the first box set, you should be prepared for someone who enjoys the series but doesn't pretend to understand it. Watching the second season did nothing to change that opinion except to increase the intensity by a factor of ten!

Fresh from a string of victories against the Protagonists of the Student Council Duelists, Utena is now forced to face off against the Black Rose Duelists. Supposedly, to get into this particular club, you must have been a duelist who died at some point in the past. But wait, how does that work? Are these zombies fighting against a cute girl with the sword years before the recent High School of the Dead craze? Nope, you just have to have a secondary character that appeared unimportant at first glance increase their value by putting on the ring and taking the sword of a loved one's soul. Only by being defeated will you be released from this obligation (or possession) none the worse for wear really.

Yeah, and the end of this arc makes no sense either. Still, it's worth the journey I assure you!",1352505600,,1243,4.610859728506787
8448163,5,B004YCKK28,"Revolutionary Girl Utena is hard to classify. It is set in high school, and yet it deals with very mature existential themes. Because it was an animated series, these themes are explored through symbolism and double entendres.

Utena is a 15-year-old who dresses as a boy (due to an encounter with a prince at a young age). She attends the exclusive Ohtori academy and learns about the student council and Anthy, the Rose Bride. Unable to bear the sight of a helpless student bullied by someone who apparently owns her, she immediately acts to rescue her.

Throughout this grim and exciting 39-episode series, we are treated to the private and public lives of many characters (even side characters are given some exposition in the Black Rose arc). The series shines as an introspective look into how complicated people can be and what drives their actions. I found this aspect of the show more riveting and interesting than the plot, which tries to be deeper than it is, but is ultimately simple upon a second reflection.

Extra features include interviews with the creators, two exquisite collectors rings, a translated Japanese commentary, behind-the-scene stories and liner notes. This is a show not to be missed.",1510012800,,1216,4.980295566502463

8448165,3,B004YCKK28,"This 2nd box set tends to be slower than the 1st one. Also tends to be very predictable and extremely repetetive. It was in this box set when i had started to give up on the show because i was loosing interest, it was starting to get kind of boring. Dont get me wrong i love this show, this box set does have its fare share of funny moments. The overall anime is incredibly good, so i do recommend putting up with these 12 episodes because the next box set will blow your mind away its so good.",1477180800,,494,4.051020408163265

I love the mini art book that comes with the set, it gives a feeling of real involvement when you can see some of the process that happened to create the series. It's really cool
