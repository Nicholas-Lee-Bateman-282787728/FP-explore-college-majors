2326354,5,B0009W4LLS,"This has long been a favorite production - I became enamored with it way back in April, 1979 when it was shown on PBS. I have an old, very crude copy of it on a Beta Tape from the time it was broadcast. I was very pleased to see it released on DVD.  Aside from the singers being much older today, the opera is very clean and fresh looking.
The music (for those that know this Opera) is positively rivoting and beautiful. It's amazing that this was dropped from the Met repetoire after the 1929 season but was resumed, I believe, in the late sixties.
Beautifully done here. Amended 6/8/09",1167782400,9,587,4.336363636363636
2326355,5,B0009W4LLS,"While it is true that the picture from this telecast is occasionally fuzzy and the sound, despite remastering, at times more congested than ideal, this ""Luisa Miller"" remains a performance of the highest caliber, a reminder of what the Met can do when it casts only from strength. Scotto, Domingo, Milnes, Giaiotti, and Morris are all captured here in their glorious primes. They are undisputably, to a person, vocal Paganinis. Moreover, James Levine has never conducted, in my experience, with a more subtle balance between vocal and orchestral demands. The only way to do justice to this performance is to call it what it surely is: an evening out of any operatic Golden Age, past or present.",1163116800,9,694,4.94017094017094

2326357,5,B0009W4LLS,"Ever since reading that there was a Met telecast of this wonderful opera from the late '70's with this cast, this conductor, I have been anxiously waiting for it to be released on DVD. The wait is over, and the disc not only lived up to my expectations, it surpassed them. Look at the names involved. Then imagine one of those classic Met productions, stage-filling but also finely detailed, where both time/place accuracy and adherence to the emotional and thematic nuances of the story are equally important. Then imagine this broadcast being restored to a level of video and audio perfection. You get the idea. If you are a fan of Luisa Miller, Verdi, the Met, James Levine or any of the great singers involved in this project, this is a must-own.

Luisa Miller has always been a favorite of mine, it is an often overlooked gem of an opera with gorgeous melodies caught in a tidal wave of ever-building dramatic intensity. With Luisa Miller, Verdi turned bel canto on its head, paving the way not only for his later, more complex music dramas, but also, with this opera's rustic setting, peasant characters and heightened melodrama, for the great verismo operas of Puccini et al. Granted, from a modern standpoint, the narrative can seem a little ridiculous at times, with people drawing swords and poisoning each other when things don't go their way, that is what I mean by heightened melodrama. Of mature Verdi operas, only Il Trovatore goes for this same level of bleeding romanticism and melodramatic gusto(well, maybe Forza should be included in that list as well). The story, based on a play by Friedrich Schiller, is pretty good, it has some traditional Verdian themes, a strong, endearing father/daughter relationship, politics interfering with personal lives and vice versa, corruption, parents destroying their children for their own selfish ends, etc., but the libretto itself is kind of silly, replete with laughably over-the-top dialogue and one-dimensional posturing. Hey, this is Italian opera. Part of Verdi's genius was his ability to take a libretto that was less than stellar, and populated by stock characters, and turn it into a fabulous opera, beautiful, melodic, evoking genuine feeling. Musically, Luisa Miller has that sort of engaging and forceful headlong rush toward tragedy that very few composers are able to achieve, and that counteracts any weaknesses in the narrative and showboating by the characters, in fact it drowns them out.

Luisa Miller is a great opera on its own, but a tremendous cast and a conductor who loves and understands Verdi can blast it into the stratosphere. Consider that the case here. Renata Scotto is one of the great Italian sopranos, not only for her voice but also for the emotional involvement she brings to every role. While she may not look like a naive peasant girl, she certainly sounds, and acts, like a woman in love, wounded by betrayal. Taking her curtain calls, she looks ready to collapse...that is real commitment. And her voice is the total package, she nails every trill as well as every dramatic passage. Placido Domingo looks kind of silly in a blonde wig, but his voice is in its prime, he has always been a Verdian tenor of the first order, possessing the requisite beauty and strength of voice and passion of character. He recognizes that Rodolfo, that crazy, id-driven romantic, is a borderline psychopath and he acts the role accordingly. Sherrill Milnes is Miller, his warm baritone voice, gushing with tenderness, brings out the necessary quality of paternal affection and concern, at no time is he anything less than convincing. James Morris, who recently sang the role of Walter at the Met, is the appropriately named Wurm, Morris' bleak, almost ghostly voice, is ideally suited for the soulless villain whose idea of love is total control. Bonaldo Giaiotti handles the other bass role, Count Walter, the more sympathetic villain, who seems to have genuine love for his son despite his mishandled way of showing it. I cannot stress this enough...all of these performances are vocally flawless, and the acting is so galvanized that it keeps the drama moving at an electric pace. Of course, James Levine's conducting is no small factor in achieving this pace. He appreciates the energy of Verdi, but he also finds the subtleties in the orchestration that not every conductor of pre-Rigoletto Verdi recognizes are there. He guides the Met orchestra through a dynamic reading of the prelude, one of the greatest, most intense orchestral passages Verdi ever wrote, but he is also very much a singer's conductor, doting on his performers during the course of the opera, allowing them to take each moment at their own speed. In a way he is like a Verdian father figure, passionate about his children but never relinquishing control, but with happier results. Such an attuned relationship between conductor and singers is a rare thing, and has to be seen to be appreciated.

Luisa Miller is an opera of darkness and light, the gaiety of village life contrasting with the brooding, oppressive machinations of the count and his ilk, and this production captures this dichotomy perfectly, from the sunny opening to the twilit conclusion. I was fortunate to see the Met's latest production of this opera make its world premiere a few years ago, it is a Dickensian setting that plays up the darkness at the expense of the light, and while it is a very good production, I think the opera needs that visual juxtaposition of opposite shadings to be totally successful, therefore I prefer this version.

I should probably quit before I ramble on too long. I've already made my point...this is a major asset to my DVD collection because every detail is handled with loving care and respect for the work. Isn't that a trademark of the Met at its best?",1158796800,59,5821,4.948875255623722
2326358,5,B0009W4LLS,"Renata Scotto triumphs yet again with this 1979 production of Verdi's opera from the MET Opera. She shows you exactly what made her stand out from other sopranos, with her wonderful expressive soprano and vivid characterisation. Five stars!",1158451200,8,240,5.342105263157895

2326360,5,B0009W4LLS,"I saw this performance in a copy of the original broadcast. Not only were Domingo, Scotto and Milnes in their prime but the overall production is beautiful.
This performmance is one of those instances in which the singers, the greatest in their profession at the time, knowing it is being produced for video, give the best of their craft.
Domingo is dazzling, powerful and convincing as Rodolfo. His 'Quando le sere al placido' aria followed by the tragic 'L'ara ol'avello aprestammi' answer to his father request of marrying the Countess instead of his beloved Luisa, is perhaps among the best singing Domingo has ever done.

Renata Scotto's powerful expressive voice also in her prime gives Luisa character and credibility. The duet in the first act with Rodolfo is a delight to listen.

Morris with his deep tragic voice (remember Die Walk&uuml;re) gives the sinister, treacherous Wurm a nice place in this performance. As does Giaiotti in Rodolfo's father 'Il Conte di Walter' role.

Jean Craft, alto expressive voice is perfect for the elegant Duchess doomed by a wrong match.

Last, but by no means least, is the strong and musical Sherill Milnes, who performs a moving, yet menacing Miller. His bravado in the 'A fu giusto il mio sospetto' aria confirming the young man pretending his daughter is a nobleman and not the peasant is a show of vocal fireworks. (Although I know many don't like Milnes, I cannot forget a beautiful Iago in Boston with McCracken and the Met, when I was a young man. Since then I have been his faithful fan.)

With the excellent leadership of Levine, this is a one of a kind perfomance not to be missed.",1156982400,89,1637,4.790780141843972

2326366,5,B0009W4LLS,"This is the last great bel canto opera from Verdi's early period. (Stiffelio was actually the last, but Verdi wasn't happy with it and rewrote it so extensively that he renamed it 'Aroldo'.) The set is fine, we even get a bit of decorative Tyrol in the opening scene. It is a pleasure to see that the costuming is spot on for the period (think of the Roundheads and Cavaliers, large white collars over black coats).
The five principals are either the best in the world or equal to the best. Renata Scotto equals Joan Sutherland in technique but far surpasses her as an actress. Her pathos in the final scenes was heart-wrenching.
Placido Domingo was at the peak of his career. I was surprised that in his big Act 11 showpiece aria, he sang with the use of brilliant tone throughout, whereas the words in the middle section were calling out for a gentler, legato colour.
Sherrill Milnes was, in my opinion, simply in his day the best baritone in the world. His technique and musicianship are magnificent.
James Morris, familiar as a Wagnerian bass, has light tone for a bass, but the added advantage of flexibility.
Bonaldo Giaiotto has a rich, honeyed basso cantate with silky smooth delivery, an ageing man, but with no sign whatever of the dreaded vibrato.
Verdi has written a bel canto opera the equal of anything that Donizetti and Bellini ever wrote, and with singers that are best world class, this production is simply superb. K.R.",1278979200,3,1438,4.687747035573122

2326370,5,B0009W4LLS,"Not to ""ditto,"" Rush-Limbaugh-like, comments other have made, but I too have hoped for a commercial, well-mastered issue of this telecast ever since it was broadcast live on PBS on a Saturday night in January, 1979.  I didn't own a video recorder at the time and recorded the audio track on a (barely adequate) cassette.  The same cast appeared on the Met's radio matinee exactly a week later, which has been available (in stereo) on CD on semi-pirate labels like Gala and Myto.  And it has its strong points, mainly that everybody sounds a bit more relaxed than they were on the live telecast a week earlier, and thus some of the singing is a bit smoother.

But I'll take the feverish excitement of the telecast any day--and say what you will about Renata Scotto's occasionally wiry top notes, the lady was always riveting to watch. Some commentators have suggested she looks too matronly here for the young Luisa--I just don't see it.  Vocally she was perhaps just past her peak here, and just beginning a precipitous slide that would crash-land about three years later with a disasterous opening-night ""Norma"" where she was practically booed off the stage. But for my ears the voice holds together nicely in this performance, and she acts her heart out.

Speaking of ""booing""... if you, like me, wondered why the Met never saw fit to release this telecast on home video, evidently they had to wait until digital video editing was sophisticated enough for them to remove a rather ugly little demonstration by an obnoxious audience member in Act One.  When Scotto begins her first solo, some idiot (evidently put out with some comments Scotto had recently made about Maria Callas) screams out ""Brava Maria Callas, soprano assoluta!!""  You DON'T see it on this DVD because DG managed to edit it out somehow (perhaps with videotape shot for test purposes at a previous performance; they neither acknowledge nor explain the omission). If you're interested, do a search on You Tube for ""Luisa Miller""--I believe the original clip can be seen there.

I have to agree that Domingo looks foolish in the blond wig, but my, he sings like a god here, all the way up to a clean high B natural--and no, this was NOT cleaned up or edited for the DVD. Love him as I do, he has a somewhat justified reputation for cracking on high notes. But not this night. ""Quando le sere"" in act two is vintage Placido: impassioned, sonorous, broadly phrased. The minute-long cheering ovation that greets him is nearly as thrilling as his singing. Even as early as the 1978-79 season Milnes was, like Scotto, on the downward slope of his vocal prime, but he often sings thrillingly here. Bonaldo Giaiotti is in characteristically rich, if rather wooly, voice as Count Walter, and his plotting and scheming with Wurm is truly terrifying.  Wurm, in the person of the young James Morris, is suitably creepy and oily. It's not exactly a showcase role vocally for a bass, but Morris has charisma galore. The supporting cast of Met regulars is perhaps less glamorous-- Jean Kraft looks more like Placido's mother than a childhood girlfriend--but they fit well into the production.  Levine was still in his ""young firebrand on the podium"" period at this time, and his conducting, right from the overture, has an exciting, stylish Toscanini-like drive and thrust.  The Met Orchestra wasn't as yet the virtuoso body they eventually became, but the playing is spirited.

The Scotto-heckler wasn't the only thing DG has edited here.  This being a live telecast, the Met's radio announcer Peter Allen performed his customary job of commenting on the curtain calls and intro'ing the station breaks.  Evidently the original stereo soundtrack was a very basic two-track job; DG no doubt wanted to eliminate Allen's live announcements for the purposes of home video, and since they couldn't simply remove them, they just dubbed over them... with ""canned"" applause... specifically, isolated ""bravos"" from the Domingo ovation in act two!  Frankly, I almost wish they had eliminated the end-of-act curtain calls altogether, just a quick fade at the curtain. But I do understand why they did it.  The camera work is a bit erratic (this was live-to-air, remember), and the video technology of 1979 isn't the last word in clarity; neither is the sound, which strikes me as too distant and echoey at times. (PBS would get much better at live audio as the ""Live from the Met"" series went on.) These same comments apply to the Met ""Rigoletto"" and ""Boheme,"" both from 1977 and released along with this ""Luisa Miller"" by DG.  But that doesn't make them any less essential.  Highly recommended.",1171497600,33,4638,4.885350318471337
2326371,4,B0009W4LLS,"To the best of my knowledge, this is the first DVD featuring Renata Scotto although I would be delighted to be proved wrong (please reissue a Tokyo Lucia with Bergonzi). The only other DVD (with June Anderson)is hardly in the same league so perhaps I should have rated it five stars!

My only negative is the very dated production; it clearly shows its age, especially aesthetically although I would be hard put to suggest how it should be staged.  Suffice it to say that it works and with Scotto and Domingo the emphasis is clearly on the singing and they deliver in spades. It is ironic that Verdi didn't give his title soprano an aria that had been excerpted and sung by sopranos of the past whereas the tenor has the glorious aria that has be recorded countless times in the days of 78's and LP recitals.  Needless to say Domingo garners the greatest ovation.  Milnes was clearly an audience favorite (if not one of mine)and there is no doubting his committment to the role both in his aria and the wonderful duets with Scotto.  It is somewhat ironic that Milnes and Domingo are roughly contemporaries while Domingo continues to sing (albeit a reduced and different repertory)and Milnes career started to fade a number of years ago.  Ordinarily baritones can enjoy longer careers than tenors, but in this case.....

Scotto is a treasure; the DVD should be required viewing and studying for any one who aspires to the repertoire.  It was late in her career yet she is savvy enough to know how to capitalize on her strengths and minimize the weaknesses.  Her attention to text is an object lesson and of course it helps that she is Italian, but she animates every phrase she sings, does nothing that is superfluous.  I saw her only once, a Butterfly in San Francisco in the 70's; it was a glorious performance.  But then she is a glorious artist.",1167955200,17,1848,4.638036809815951
2326372,3,B0009W4LLS,"Of course a profound Opera lover will prefer more sophisticated and advanced works of the Italian verismo, German Opera, etc. Even a novice in Italian Opera will always have more popular and vibrant Verdian repertoire to choose from. But Luisa Miller is a fine work which already shows the Verdi we would really know immediately after, with his Rigoletto, Il Trovatore and La Traviata phase. Not to mention his mature works, the best! But this is virtually the one complete Luisa Miller available. What is really interesting is that it is taken from a series of fine Met performances from the late 70's and early 80's which were originally negotiated exclusively for PBS telecast and so, very difficult to renegotiate for release on DVD. But I'd say it is worth the effort and I truly hope Universal honors the Deutsche Grammophone label and keep up with the releases. The first has been Rigoletto featuring Domingo, McNeil and Cotrubas. Now, Luisa Miller, but there are many other incredible performances that can not be lost forever. After all, even though technically, lights and cameras weren't as good as they are today, the performances are of unique musical quality and interest. This Luisa captures Met singers at their prime. Domingo, Scotto and, especially, Milnes, are in great shape. Milnes, once laureled as the greatest American baritone, later to be somewhat forgotten for his health problems which really affected his stage performances in the late 80's and 90's, sounds like a million bucks here! From this ""Live from the Met"" series period, I remember a striking Pagliacci (Domingo, Stratas, Milnes - an unforgettable ""prologue""), Zeffirelli's Otello (Domingo, Cruz-Romo, Milnes), Cavalleria Rusticana (Domingo, Troyanos, Monk) and MANY OTHERS. Let us hope Universal keeps on releasing them. And, most of all, let us BUY THEM, otherwise it gets difficult for those businessmen to justify it.",1167868800,17,1909,5.181229773462783

She had said in a special made to honor Callas, 'But why she do this to me!' Opera fanatics are unforgiving.  Nevertheless, Scotto was in fine voice at this time and it was a triumph.  She was a great singing actress and  began her decline when she tried to assume roles too heavy for her rather small lyric voice.  I saw her with Alfredo Kraus in a Lucia that was the best i had ever seen. Ietter than the 2 I had had seen with Callas.  Her Suor Angelica was tops.  The first one even better than the one taped 4 years later.  It's the old story of opera singers rising and falling when they try  to do too much.

8067865,4,B0009W4LLS,"Luisa Miller is the first product of what is often termed Verdi's Middle Years.  Verdi wrote Luisa Miller for the Teatro San Carlo in Naples, where the opera was first performed on December 8, 1849.  The acknowledged Verdi masterpieces Rigoletto (1851) and La Traviata and Il Trovatore (1853) followed not long afterwards.  Luisa Miller is full of glorious Verdi music, arias, duets and ensemble singing.  One therefore has to question why the opera is so rarely performed.  The libretto, by Salvatore Cammarano, is based on Schiller's play, Kabale und Liebe (Intrigue and Love).

Luisa Miller is a Verdi heroine whose trajectory of happiness to misery parallels and foreshadows that of Violetta in La Traviata, although Violetta is to me a much more credible and sympathetic character.  Luisa Miller also foreshadows Rigoletto in the portrayal of a loving father and daughter relationship.  However, again Rigoletto and Gilda are much more credible and memorable operatic characters.  The libretto of Luisa Miller is often clumsy and unreal and the narrative is quite silly in many ways especially when Rodolfo takes poison and poisons Luisa in Act III.  These factors may be partly responsible for the rare performances of Luisa Miller on the world's great opera stages.

Therefore anyone attending a performance of this opera or watching a DVD of a performance does so largely for the music and singing unlike in La Traviata or Rigoletto where the music is sublime but the stories and characters are also very vivid and compelling.  It was therefore a disappointment for me to find that this DVD of a 1979 revival of Luisa Miller at the Metropolitan Opera produced by Deutsche Grammaphon has a very poor and muffled audio quality.  This greatly detracts from the beauty of the music.

I compared the sound quality with that on a CD recording of the opera starring Ricciarelli as Luisa, Domingo as Rodolfo, Bruson as Miller and Obraztsova as Federica made in London in 1979 with the orchestra and chorus of the Royal Opera House and Lorin Maazel conducting.  Curiously, this recording is also a Deutsche Grammaphon product.  The CD brings out the beauty of the opera and the wonderful singing in a way that highlights the weakness of the DVD.  I do not know much about the technicalities of CD versus DVD recordings but the disparity is profound and almost inexplicable.

Poor audio quality notwithstanding, the DVD presents several outstanding performances.  My favorite here was Sherrill Milnes as Miller.  More so than the other characters he brings a sense of dignity to the role that is most impressive.  He does not overact.  His renditions of ""Sacra la scelta e d'un consorte"" and of ""Ah! Fu giusto il mio sospetto"" in Act I represent the very peak of the Verdi baritone's art.  Renata Scotto as Luisa sings beautifully although I preferred Ricciarelli in the role.  Her acting is also of a high quality.

Placido Domingo's singing is of a very high order indeed.  His rendition of ""Quando le sere al placido"" is breathtakingly beautiful.  His acting is a little over the top, however, and his blonde wig is beyond ridiculous.  Jean Kraft is weak as the Duchessa Federica.  In her Act I, Scene 2 duet with Rodolfo, she is greatly overpowered by Domingo's larger volume.  Elena Obraztsova in the London recording shows how the Duchessa's role should really be sung.  James Morris as Wurm is suitably oily and vicious and we can see the origins of the great Wagner roles that lay ahead for him.  Bonaldo Giaiotti as Count Walter is most impressive.  A young and energetic James Levine conducts the superb Met orchestra with verve.  The overture is Verdi at his best.

The set is very traditional to the extent of being almost laughable in its faux-Swiss kitsch.  However, the video quality is very good for a 1979 production.  The costumes are often rather silly.

This is apparently the best DVD of Luisa Miller that is available.  I can recommend it to anyone who has not seen the opera performed with the caveat that the poor audio quality detracts considerably from the value of the DVD.  It may not be possible again to assemble a cast of this quality for a revival of Luisa Miller.  However, if there is such a revival in the future a Blu-ray DVD with good sets would be a most welcome addition to any opera lover's collection.",1416441600,4,4340,4.866302864938609
