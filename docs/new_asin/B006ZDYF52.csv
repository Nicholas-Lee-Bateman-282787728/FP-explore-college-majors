8506888,5,B006ZDYF52,"Love Story At Harvard is about the portrayal of the dream and love pursued by Korean students studying in Harvard. The drama demonstrates bright, hard-working, ambition, and romantic characters and story lines.

A young love story set at the famed Ivy League school in the United States. Kim Hyun Woo,a 1st year law student at Harvard Law, enters into a rivalry with classmate Hong Jung Min for the affections of beautiful medical student Lee Soo In. The two men are both from prestigious families, while Soo In is from a poor family.

This drama had a lot of promise considering that it was about foreign students at Harvard. I thought that this was going to happen in the U.S. and it will live up to the title about a romantic relationship in the Ivy League school. Unfortunately,that only happened in the first half of the drama. The other half happened in Seoul. Korean drama elements such as one of the lead characters having a terminal illness, a love triangle, the protagonist and the antagonist becoming friends and a happy ending took over. It became a clichd drama just like any other Korean drama. Sad but true.

The first part of the drama was great. The love story between Hyun Woo and Soo In was great. The classroom mock trial, the disciplinary council scenes, the classroom rivalry between Hyun Woo and Hong Jung Min,the experiences of law students at Harvard Law School and the development of all the lead characters were great in the first 8 episodes. Things went downhill when the story transferred to Seoul when expected Korean drama elements took over.

When the storyline transferred in Seoul, the environmental case had a lot of promise. Unfortunately, it was underdeveloped. Also,the drama turned into low gear as the LOVE STORY of both Hyun Woo and Soo In became slow and OVER THE TOP in Seoul. Aside from that, the early law career of Hyun Woo become somewhat predictable. Also, the Soo In character in Seoul became somewhat weak as compared to the Soo In at Harvard. The female lead character became weak all of a sudden without any explanation whatsoever.

There were also many unrealistic plots that were presented in the second part of the drama when all characters moved from Harvard to Seoul. It was just so disappointing that ""Love Story At Harvard"" had the promise to become an unforgettable and classic Korean drama. Unfortunately, this became an ABOVE AVERAGE Korean drama instead of a CLASSIC one. If the writers of the drama become more original and creative, then ""Love Story At Harvard"" would have become what ""My Sassy Girl"" is as a Korean movie. I was truly disappointed when it did not become one.

Despite of my comments previously, I still would highly recommend ""Love Story At Harvard"" to anyone who enjoys watching a Korean Drama for the acting in this drama was great. Kim Rae Won and the gorgeous Kim Tae Hee definitely had great chemistry.",1422230400,,2889,4.779559118236473

I would recommend it!",1396137600,,128,4.608695652173913
8506892,5,B006ZDYF52,"This is the same main actor that played in 'My Little Bride', and his performance in that movie was very good, believable, and entertaining.  So relying on instinct, I purchase 'Love Story in Harvard' w/out knowing much about the movie, other than reading the reviews.  My instinct was spot-on!",1385164800,2,294,4.979591836734694
8506893,5,B006ZDYF52,"My suggestion is that you purhase this series before it goes out of print.  This version is nicely packaged and has good subtitles..  The story is well-written, and the actors are superb.  Special acknowledgement should be given for the valiant attempt at speaking English for the classroom recitation scenes; it had to be extremely challenging, and the two male leads (Kim Rae Won and Lee Jung-jn) made a great effort.  The female leads, Kim Tae-hee and Kim Min, appear to have studied English for a few years because they spoke effortlessly.  This story is so much more than a college romance, following the actors to the next phase of life when the real challenges begin.  Seeing them mature as they confront the vissitudes of life keeps the viewer interested throughout the 18 episodes without the ""mid-series slump"" which often occurs about the 10th episode.  The actors get a chance to show their full range of emotion and acting skills.  It's worth watching more than once.",1369008000,3,980,4.8969696969696965
8506894,5,B006ZDYF52,"The story's script is excellent as well as having the combination of Kim Rae Won and Kim Tae Hee as the main characters.
The cinematography and setting of this DVD make the story very realistic.",1365552000,2,194,4.571428571428571
