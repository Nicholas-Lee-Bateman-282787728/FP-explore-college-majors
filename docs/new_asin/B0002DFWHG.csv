This lovely gem delivers what we enjoy as well: sky, clouds, waterfalls, rivers, dragonflies, humming birds, bears, etc. The music selection is excellent. She particularly loves the moons at the end and giggles at those lovely babies.

The only downside: the main content is less than 14 minutes long. No extras or anything. Considering the DVD entertainment business nowadays, this is probably the most expensive 14 minutes we've ever bought. In addition to the cost, no typical dvd players can be set to repeat a movie so we have to find the remote to play it again (this is the only program we are not worried about her watching it more).",1186099200,,808,4.9411764705882355
8026628,5,B0002DFWHG,"As an Oregon state certified Child Development Specialist I have worked with parents of typically developing children, teen parents and parents of children with disabilities.  This beautiful DVD is a way for both parents and children to marvel and wonder at the beauty of our glorious planet.  Children point with delight and call out the names of the imaginatively photographed animals. Parents find a calming respite in the fantastic images and soothing music. We know that young children should spend very little time watching televiwion. This DVD is developmentally appropriate because it is brief, educational and can truly be enjoyed in the best way: with parents and children watching it together.",1089590400,5,704,5.333333333333333
