985536,3,6305161518,"This movie is hilarious it's so bad!  If you have trouble finding mistakes in Ed Wood movies-then this movie is a great primer.  The movie begins with brief nudity and either a murder, a molestation or a rape-maybe even necrophilia--who can tell-but it has nothing at all to do with the rest of the movie.  The dialogue is pratically non-existent-except for an over-the-top narration. Tor Johnson brandishes a giant club, while our hero cops take a girls pulse while carrying her--headed for a cliff that looks to be about ten feet high-where they are worried about falling hundreds of feet to their death.  Watch this with friends for a great laugh-everyone can join in and miss nothing. Actually-picture yourself about ten or eleven years old and think--this is the movie you probably would have made!!  The highlight is when one of our hero cops in an airplane shoots a father looking for his missing children with the motto-""Shoot first ask questions later""  The nuclear test zone is a treat too-not a tree or bush is even slightly damaged-even though the blast has turned Tor into the ""Beast""--too many mistakes to mention-but they're all unbelievably bad. This would be a great movie to show to your arty farty acquaintances who love movies like ""Claire's Knee""",983836800,6,1267,4.897196261682243

The good thing about this movie is that other movies which are bad don't seem quite as bad anymore.  Sitting in the movie theater, you'll say to yourself, ""This movie isn't as bad as The Beast from Yucca Flats!""  It will at a new air of enjoyment your cinema experiences, no matter what the film-making quality!

985539,1,6305161518,"This movie is so terrible it has a certain kind of charm.  The entire soundtrack was either lost or never recorded so the whole thing is either narrated or voices are dubbed onto characters when their backs are to the  camera (most shots of characters speaking appear to have been excised to  hide the lost soundtrack so the editing is often choppy).  Tor Johnson  gives his most incompetent ever performance as ""the beast"" (an  atomic blast has turned him into a lumbering killer).  Several of his takes  are obviously messed up - he has great difficulty getting out of an  aeroplane for example - but the filmmmakers couldn't afford any re-takes.  He lumbers through the desert at about 1mph waving a stick at everyone.  A  wrestling match he has with the police must be seen to be disbelieved.  Amazing.

985653,3,6305161518,"I would like to first note that any review of this movie would almost certainly involve more creative thought than went into its writing and production.

At the risk of insulting the abilities of the mildly retarded, The Beast of Yucca Flats is the result one could expect if a camera and no budget were given to a group of mildly retarted persons who were told to produce a movie in one day.  Tor Johnson (who is not an actor but rather an ex professional wrestler) was billed as the ""Star"", and his only line in the movie was ""Yaaaaaaa!!!!!!""  Tor was the victim of the United States' indiscriminate detonation of a nuclear bomb in Yucca flats, toasting all those who the government apparently did not bother to evacuate in advance.  As a survivor of the blast he lived in a cave and wandered as a beast in the desert terrorizing or killing anyone who happened to drive through the blast zone.  Barney Fife and his local yokel sidekick search for the beast, and in doing so indiscriminately shoot at anyone who runs from them, including a tourist who hiked into the desert looking for his idiot sons who went wandering away while his dowdy wife with horned rimmed glasses wrings her hands helplessly. ""Chase scenes"" were set back 1000 years, with Tor wallowing through the desert like a crippled, obese Fester Admas.  Mercifully, the movie has minimal dialogue which is mostly pointless and poorly delivered.  Rather, the movie is narrated (also poorly), with the narrator redundantly criticizing anything done ""in the name of progress"", and needlessly describing scenes that are self explanatory.  In case you are as dumb as me to buy and watch this gem, I will not give away the ending.  Suffice it to say, there are no clever twists, as the movie ends with a duller thud than what hits the ground from the South end of  a North bound cow.  For reasons that I do not understand myself, I am somewhat hypnotized by its awfulness and had to own this movie; perhaps  as a standard by which all other movies (including Bill & Ted's excellent Adventure) appear as cinematic masterpieces.",1354147200,,2086,4.684931506849315

A really bad and senseless Sci-fi horror movie that ranks as one of the worst movies of all time even among the critics.

985730,1,6305161518,"It's incredible how a movie can be 55 minutes long, and have a lot of padding.  But that's what ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" manage to achieve, and you know what else it achieved?  Having the worst make-up design for a monster in film himself.  I wouldn't even bother to call Tor Johnson's character a monster, he looked like an exhausted obese man with severe sunburn.  Putting skin peels on his face does not make him a monster; I'm not hoping for Tom Savini quality of make-up design, but the crew should put in more of an effort than that.  Tor himself didn't bother to act like a monster, he went through the same motions he did in the Ed Wood movies: stumbling on, awkwardly attacking people with his thick arms, looking confused, and his vein attempt at growing...or was he yawning?

He as a monster didn't act that much different that his character was before he became The Beast; if you make the monster wear a business suit, he'll look like a solicitor for hair-care products.  And since I segued into the story, a long time ago, Tor was just a simple businessman who was involved in a mob attack right in the desert (I think, I was distracted by the thought of Tor in a business suit).  He escaped (although it didn't look like he ran very far), and suddenly a nuclear bomb blasted within his radius, and the radiation turned him into a skin-peeling, lady-chocking growler.  Y'know, whatever happened to the mobsters that were chasing him?  They weren't that far from him, so why didn't they become beasts as well?  Once the backstory's out of the way, the movie is just goes here and there.  The Beast chocked some random woman in the beginning, and the film didn't explain her importance.  Then he chokes a couple, the woman of which he brings to his cave, so the cops will find and declare her dead.  Finally, there's a bunch of kids walking in the desert for no reason, and all they do just keep on walking, while the parents are worried and do absolutely nothing.  Cops are trying to stop him, and that's all the beast spoke.

""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" is a largely dialogue-less movie, which the exception of the narrator talking about The Beast and his instinct to kill (that's pretty much all he has to say).  A horror movie with very little dialogue may seem like an attempt at immersion, but in this case, it makes the movie very lifeless in an already directionless story.  There's so few interactions and developments with the characters, they're all just going in their separate ways.  I wanted to enjoy this simply for its B-movie values, but there's no joy in the flaws it had.  I was so bored watching this, unironically bored.  Calling this one of the worst movies of all time is too quaint.  This movie is nothing.  Invalid.  An unsalvageable product of its own low-budget genre.",1281398400,,2807,4.5568862275449105

 Most of the film is narrated if that's what you can call it. A side benefit is that we get a chance to see what 1961 cars, cloths, haircuts, and sleazy women (Lanell Cado ... Woman Strangled in Opening Scene) look like.

985732,5,6305161518,"It seems a lot of people feel that this is a bad film.  Perhaps it is, but I prefer to think of it as a ""different"" film.  It's certainly different from most American films of its time in that director Coleman Francis took a European approach, making what is essentially a silent film and adding minimal dialog with ADR.  The film cheerfully throws logic and plot away from the very first scene and instead, serves up one of the most surreal and curious experiences in cinematic history.  As lost ""city boys feed sodapop to thirsty pigs"" and a gunman randomly shoots down an innocent man from an airplane, Tor Johnson as Joseph Javorsky (noted scientist) is turned into a beast with terrible skin problems by a nuclear bomb explosion.  There is a coyote, a cute bunny rabbit, some cowboy cops, KGB agents and a surly gas station attendant.  There is a flag on the moon (where did it come from?) and there is a young married couple (unaware of scientific progress).  And don't forget the NUDE (yes a fully nude in 1961) strangulation scene that starts the picture. What it all might add up to I couldn't venture to guess but I'm certain that it is a weirdly entertaining hour of bizzare images and rather gorgeous black and white cinematography.  This edition from the incredible folks at Alpha video is the definitive DVD release.  Unlike some of the previous releases, this one is unedited and contains the full nude scene.  Alpha has also included the original theatrical trailer for the film as well as an extensive catalog art gallery.  The cover art for this release is the best of any of the editions I've seen.  The print has some minor damage but in most scenes it is near prestine.  Certainly this film won't appeal to many people but it is a great example of leftover 50's paranoia, showcasing some of the fears from that generation that often made them seem so exceptionally stupid.  If you are into genuinely odd films, this one is a prime example.",1257465600,13,1960,4.627167630057803

985734,3,6305161518,"I am a BIG fan of bad movies, and have often said that the worse a movie was, the better I liked it. But I now see that there is a point at which a movie can be so bad that even I cannot abide it.

Well, lets first look at the positives. First, and thankfully, it was short. I can take being water-boarded for 54 minutes without spilling my guts so making it through this movie was a walk in the park. It really was over before the true awfulness of the movie had a chance to sink in. If it had been 90 minutes it would have been a different story, I probably would have had to gouge my eyes out. Secondly, and here is the funny part, the transfer was EXTREMELY good. Flawless in fact, one of the best I have ever seen. Where did they find an original print of this movie in such good condition? Also, the quality of the DVD itself was really good, the thing is twice as thick as most DVDs. I guess in a pinch you could sharpen it up and use it like a shurekin. So it stands on technical merit if nothing else. And don't forget Jim's hot babe. She was sexy in a middle-aged trashy sort of way.

Ok, the bad part. Well, that was everything between the opening credits and the end. I put it that way because the opening scene before the credits rolled was pretty avant guarde for 1961. I did not know you could get away with displaying bare jugs on the silver screen in 1961, but there they were. It gets points for that. Two snaps up to Tony for having the huevos to pull that off. He showed a little streak of Russ Meyer there. But other than that it was just plain unvarnished cinematic awfulness.

The ""plot"", a defecting scientist, was pretty stock those days, but the whole ""wandering out on to Yucca Flats"" thing?? I used to live not too far from there and I can assure you that a gnat cannot ""wander out on to Yucca Flats"" without having guys with machine guns come out of the woodwork. And the sign leading to Yucca Flats is not a piece of cardboard nailed to a tomato stake with ""Yucca Flats"" written on it with a crayon. As I recall there is mention of ""Use of Deadly Force Authorized Beyond This Point"" on that sign, which usually deters folks from ""wandering"" any further.

Tor Johnson (RIP) was the selling point for this flick, but you can only stand so much of an overweight and pitifully out of shape Tor staggering around like a drunk strangling people. And that was pretty much all that happened after the pitiful ""chase scene"" culminating in his being scorched by a nuke test and degenerating into The Beast. And in the end, when the golden opportunity presented itself, Tor missed the chance to strangle that rabbit or bite it's head off or something. At least that would have had some shock value after those flaccid strangling scenes of his.

The soundtrack......WHAT SOUNDTRACK??? This was essentially a silent movie with a narrative ""soundtrack"" plastered on it in post production, and everything else Foleyed in at some point. Even the voices of the ""actors"" were done in narrative style, I thought they stopped doing that after ""The Jazz Singer"" came out. Not that it really made the movie any harder to watch, it just added to it's overall terribleness.

And that horrible scene where Jim flew around shooting at the wrong guy for half the movie. That went on for way too long, but provided you a nice little ""intermission"" to go get something to eat without missing anything of note, as if there was anything to miss.

OK, so why am I giving it three stars you might be thinking?? Well, you cannot give it less than one, and it earns a point for the unbelievably good video transfer, even if the transfer was wasted such a bad movie. That gets it up to two stars. It earns another star simply because it sets the bar to a new cinematic low. Fans of Ed Wood and Phil Tucker can sit back smugly, confident that NOBODY can watch ""The Beast"" and still think ""Plan 9"" or ""Robot Monster"" is the worst movie ever made. The bad movie category now has a new champion.

So, if you are a real glutton for punishment, go ahead and drop the $4.99 for this one, just so you can say you saw it. Pull it out one night when you have some buddies over to watch some bad movies and astound them with your ability to sit through the worst of the lot.",1228953600,2,4257,4.305867665418227
985735,1,6305161518,"I watched the legendary The Beast Of Yucca Flats for the first time ever on one of those cheapo 50 movie pak DVDs, so there were no extras, save for chapter selection. Given my years of childhood staying awakings throughout the 1970s, and watching every film, it seemed, in the catalogs of such legendary shows as Chiller Theater and Creature Feature, how I missed this is beyond me; especially given that its lead star is the truly legendary Tor Johnson, of Plan 9 From Outer Space infamy.
  For those in the know, Johnson was a Swedish wrestler who played a ghoul in Ed Wood's great 1959 bad film, and, were that his only claim to- ok, let's call it `fame,' that would be enough. However, just a mere two years, and it seems 150 or more pounds heavier, Johnson turned in an even better, or badder, role in the 1961 black and white atrocity, The Beast Of Yucca Flats. Ok, perhaps atrocity is too strong, for this film does have a few of the `good' bad aspects that define Wood's film, as well as the classic Robot Monster. Better yet, it clocks in at a mere 54 minutes in length, showing a decency and consideration most bloated Hollywood bombs never show their viewers. However, it does not have enough of them that it can rank up there with such as the other aforementioned films. Mainly, this is because it lacks all humor....except for the narration (by the film's director, Coleman Francis), which is amongst the worst ever in film, save for its unintended humor. The cinematography, however, has no such caveat, as the poor framing, atrocious editing, and unsynched audio track- the film was filmed silently, then conversations were added in later, but it's a mess, nonetheless, as characters speak only when their faces are not visible, and gunshots ring out only when the pulled guns wander out of frame. Because the director did not care to even allow his actors to speak I don't think it's even necessary to delineate them nominally, so I won't. Besides, would you even watch this film is you knew it starred Bing Stafford as....? No, ain't gonna give you the name of the actor. The reason you're even reading this is because of Tor Johnson, anyway. Back to detailed criticism: even worse than the unsynched audio is the scoring, in which standard 1950s era television `exciting' music clues the viewer into the fact that something `exciting' is going on. Well, not really, but didacticism has its needs. No? Perhaps the worst aspect of the film, however, is the screenplay, written by the multitasking Francis, whose prescience in doing so, decades before the term multitasking was coined, is a marvel.... The Beast Of Yucca Flats is a bad film that is so nonsensical that to emphasize its badness is utterly beside the point, for anyone seeking sense in such a film should have his head examined. See, I can stoop to banality when needed. Oh, and before I forget, parts of the film are in nearly pristine condition, while other reels are streaked and blemished. I just decided to throw that factoid in. And this: the film is dull, unless one factors in the bad narration, which would then make the narration somehow redolent of something deeper, even if the onscreen action is still dull.
  But, then there's the (imagine a deep, rich manly voice bellowing) X FACTOR!!!! Tor Johnson, whose utter inability to emote, heroic resistance to gravity's pull on corpulence, and seeming unawareness to differentiate between real life and fiction make him utterly irresistible to the human eye. I challenge any film critic to watch this film, or any of his other classic B film appearances, and state that he dominates the screen like few cinema stars ever have. Granted, a month old festering corpse might attract the same sort of perverse voyeurism, but that's just details. Having seen this film now, I can honestly say I am content to lay down in a desert and have a wild hare nibble at my rotting remains. Although, I doubt I could master Johnson's moving corpse as well.

985736,4,6305161518,"Wow I didn't even know that Yucca Flats was such a progressive place, at least that's what the narrator/director keeps telling us over and over.  I don't know about you but when did a desert become a place of progress!?!

This has to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, that was not intentionally being funny!  Everyone credits Plan 9 From Outer Space as being the worst film of all time but I have to say this movie makes Plan 9 look like a big budget motion picture.  Everything about this film is just plain bad but that's what makes it so damn entertaining!  I see that many people don't agree with me but where else can you watch a chase scene that is absolutely ridiculous?

A Soviet scientist (Tor Johnson in his last starring role, thank god) is running from people that are shooting at him at point blank range but continue to miss him.  You have to understand that Tor is a huge wrestler and is not that quick on his feet and is an EASY target but somehow he outruns these pursuers and ends up right next to the stock footage of a nuclear bomb going off!

Well with a little bit of facial skin damage and a hand that has some peeling skin (he must have had a sunburn from all of the desert scenes and that's the extent of the effects) he is turned into THE BEAST!  No he looks like the same guy but badly in need of sunscreen!  Get this man some aloe pronto and he won't be so crazy.  Well this sends him over the deep end as the announcer so kindly tells us.  The narration is what makes this stinker so darn funny.  It sounds sometimes like he is just reading some random words and it's all improvisation.  Sometimes it makes sense and sometimes it doesn't, like this classic line, ""Children from New York, not exposed to progress"" HUH? What?  Are you telling me that there is more progress in the desert than in New York?  What a mess this film is but that's what makes it so lovingly wonderful!

Get a couple of kegs, invite some friends over and watch their faces turn to shock and horror when you put this stinker on!

985778,2,6305161518,"I am unsure of why I gave this movie two stars instead of one.  I think it might have been Tor Johnson's riveting performance.  Well, maybe it was the scene where the sheriff shoots a guy running down the road because, (1) the guy was running down the road and (2) he could.  Something about this movie just begs for a remake.  Maybe they could use Tor Johnson again.  Just because Johnson has been dead for more than 35 years would hardly be noticeable if the remake was anything like this movie.

The really bad thing about this movie is that the opening scene is the best scene in the entire movie.  The movie goes down hill from there.  Tor Johnson is supposedly a scientist defecting to the U.S.  I suppose the people chasing after Johnson are supposed to be KGB or spies.  Regardless, the protection he got from his bodyguards was pitiful, but did give Johnson an excuse to wander off into the nearby desert, which also happens to be where nuclear testing regularly occurred.

Now, you might wonder why this particular nuclear testing site was open to tourists.  I am going to have to let you speculate on that one, because I have no good answers.  The really unfortunate thing for Tor Johnson is that he missed the souvenir stand at the entrance to the site.  You know, the one with the two-headed lizards and the replica giant Gila monsters known to have been created by nuclear radiation.  I digress.

The radiation turns Tor/the Soviet scientist into a mindless killing machine.  Tor then stumbles about the desert silently.  As it turns out, director Francis Coleman made the movie very silently because he filmed none of the movie with a soundtrack.  Everything you hear, Coleman had dubbed later, which is why the little boys lost in the desert sound like they are talking from the bottom of a coffee can.  Of course, the lack of sound meant that Tor Johnson could stumble about the desert without making a sound, sneaking up on people to attack them.  Yeah, I know.  But that statement makes about as much sense as the movie.

The local sheriff decides that shooting anyone running about the desert is a sure-fire method of eliminating the killer, no matter how many innocent fathers he has to kill in the process.  Of course, if you kill enough innocent people, eventually you have to get the killer through process of elimination.  If you ever wondered why the desert is so empty...

Anyway, by the time this movie is over I was scratching my head.  I was wondering why I subject myself to these movies.  I was wondering who gave Francis Coleman money to make this thing.  I was wondering why Tor Johnson agreed to appear in this movie, which killed his career (it was the last movie Johnson ever made).  On the other hand, you would have thought that ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" would have killed Johnson's film career.  You just never know, I guess.

On the other hand, if you get all worked up about the sound and picture quality, I can tell you that both seem to replicate the inanity of the original film with too much accuracy.

If you have to watch every awful science fiction movie ever made, you absolutely have to get this movie.  Is it worse than ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""?  That is a hard call.  However, this movie sure gives that movie a challenge as far as being the worst movie ever made.  Just remember, there are some things that were not meant to be seen by the eyes of man, and this movie may be one of them.

Well, Tor Johnson is supposed to be some kind of large scientist running away or something.  But an A-bomb explosion turns him into the Beast of Yucca Flats.  Which means he wears ugly rags and runs around, instead of wearing a suit and running around, like he was doing earlier in the movie.  Actually, I don't know what the plot of the movie is, but I think this is really it.  If I'm wrong, I'm not off by much, and if I am off by much, my plot synopsis is bound to be better than the actual plot of the movie.  That's how bad it is.

So some rifle guys in helicopters are called in to hunt down the beast.  They see a man in the field with his kid and immediately their minds think, ""There's the beast right there!  Let's kill it!""  So that's what they do.  And I forget how the Beast of Yucca Flats dies, or if he dies, but I'll always remember, ""Flag on the moon,"" even though I'll NEVER know what the heck that means.",1183593600,3,1073,4.200980392156863
985781,1,6305161518,"I am somewhat proud of the fact that I am so familiar with the works of Coleman Francis that even watching this for the first time, I was very easily able to spot Francis and producer Anthony Cardoza in their (multiple) cameo appearances.  I'm also tickled that I was able to spot the guy who played ""Cherokee Jack"" in RED ZONE CUBA without even trying.  This may not get me into Mensa, but gives me a warm sensation on this cold spring day in all the parts of my mind and body that crave bad moviemaking.

This film runs for two and fifty minutes.  It has just about enough plot for the two, but the fifty is left oddly hanging.  It's difficult to believe that a film that's eight minutes short of an hour could feel like a lifetime, but believe me it does.

The story is about Tor Johnson (PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and THE UNEARTHLY) as a defecting Soviet scientist.  This bit of casting is probably the film's first mistake.  If you're going to have someone believable as an intelligent, reputable man of science, it would perhaps be better to stay away from the Swedish ex-wrestlers.

In any event, the scientist heads towards the Yucca Flats nuclear testing grounds.  On route, he is attacked by Soviet agents (look, it's Tony Cardoza!) who want to kill Tor and destroy the information he carries.  Tor escapes their gunfire simply by walking very quickly away from them.  Unfortunately, he wanders onto the proving grounds themselves and is hit by a nuclear bomb.  Rather than blasting him into his component atoms, the effect is merely to turn this notable scientist into the eponymous Beast.

The Beast now has an unquenchable appetite for death.  To satisfy his cravings he begins a killing spree out on the wastelands.  This is not, it must be noted, the most efficient location for a killing spree.  Fortunately for Tor -- thanks to movie logic -- the abandoned wastelands seem to have a fair number of great fools willing to go into them and be knocked over by Tor.

""Flag on the moon,"" intones the narrator.  ""How did it get there?""  How indeed.  The film's narration is littered with these apparent non sequiturs (the previous question arrives unannounced in the middle of a car chase sequence).  The narrator is by far the most entertaining portion of this film, interrupting the action with bad poetry about human progress related in a bland monotone.

Sounds like a fun, cheesy sci-fi/horror film right?

Well, if you haven't seen it, it would be difficult for you to believe exactly how mind-numbingly dull this film is.  It's less than an hour, but during my second viewing I kept finding excuses to walk about of the room.  The problem is that there isn't enough action in it.  Tor Johnson needed to do more killing.  Almost all of the film seems to involve either two police officers wandering around the wasteland looking for Tor or two young boys blinding stumbling around the location shoot.  Tor's is the slowest rampage you'll ever in your life see.

I find myself rendered mentally immobile enough after two viewings to have much of anything left to say.  The dialog is stilted.  The direction is dizzying in its utter lack of a breakneck pace.  The plot -- as  I indicated -- would have trouble fleshing out a two minute trailer.  I would almost recommend this as a way of turning an ordinary metal and plastic television set into something that most humans cannot bear to look at for more than a few minutes at a time.  This is definitely a film that only a bad movie lover could endure, but even with previous bad movie experience, you should approach this one with caution.",1176768000,2,3603,4.62776025236593
985782,1,6305161518,"According to film lore, THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS was filmed without sound and dialogue was dubbed in postproduction.  In order to accomodate this effect, the camera usually photographs characters in long shot; cuts off their heads; shows a character listening in a reaction shot; or has the so-called actors cover their mouths at strategic moments.  The effect is very obvious and even so there are quite a few moments where characters are clearly speaking but no sound is coming out.

This is actually the most interesting thing about the film.  The story, such as it is: a Russian scientist (Tor Johnson) has defected to the United States.  Chased by Russian agents, he escapes into an atomic test area, where radiation converts him into a mindless killer.  He kills a vacationing couple and local police officers pursue him.  One of the police officers takes to the air, where he mistakes an innocent man for the Beast, and spends quite a lot of time shooting at him.  And so on.

YUCCA FLATS has the reputation of being among the worst films ever made.  The reputation is deserved.  The film looks like it cost about twenty six cents to make; the cast is uninspired, to say the least; and the script (which consists largely of meaningless narration) is stupid in a very unamusing way.  Some bad films are amusing to watch.  YUCCA FLATS is not among them.

985783,1,6305161518,"In the realm of bad movies, there is the good-bad, and there is the bad-bad.

And then there's The Beast of Yucca Flats. I call this the good-bad-ugly.

The good: it runs for only 54 minutes.

The bad: that's 54 minutes too long.

The ugly: Tor Johnson.

Some fans of truly bad films may like this. I am a fan of truly bad films, and I didn't like this. For the most part, at least. Sure, it has its moments. The whole notion of Ed Wood regular Tor Johnson playing a Russian scientist defecting to the US is, on its own, pretty laughable. But once that's established and the movie rolls along, you're pretty much done laughing at that idea.

So you ask yourself, what's next? How about the narrator's lines? Hmm, we may be on to something here. There is not a single line that makes sense. I'll say that again, not a single one. But do they pass the good-bad test of making you laugh? Well,  yes, but the laughter is often accompanied by groans of disbelief and wrinkling of the brows. By comparison, such classics as Robot Monster and Plan 9 are laugh-out-loud hilarious.

Hey, how about plot twists? Look, we have Tor kissing a rabbit at the end. How's that for a surprise ending? Uh, doesn't work for you? Ok, I didn't think it would.

Conclusion: The Beast of Yucky, excuse me, Yucca Flats is not bad enough to be good-bad. The laughs are too few and far-between. And it's too boring to be that much fun. But still, you have to credit Coleman Francis for scoring some remarkable feats with this piece.

1. He manages to bore us in just 54 minutes.

2. He actually made money out of this. Ok, maybe that's not all that remarkable, since you really can't lose when you start with a budget of $0.

3. So how about this: he succeeded where Ed Wood failed. He killed Tor Johnson's career. That's right, this abomination of filmmaking was the ex-wrestler's swan song.

Never before has a 54 minute film seemed so long and boring.  In fact, the film doesn't even feel like a feature film, but more like a cold war propaganda film they would show in schools back in the 50s.  Tor is a scientist(yeah right) that survives an atomic blast in the desert and becomes some scarred mutant killer.  He's supposed to be on a rampage I guess, but up until the final minutes he just wanders around the desert.  Two cops try to hunt him down.  A family gets stuck in the desert and Tor goes after their two boys in the not too exciting climax.  The film wasn't shot in direct sound.  That's not a big deal to me usually coz the Italians do it all the time, but this was rotten.  In the few cases of dialogue, never once do you see a character's mouth move.  Their backs are always to the camera or at a distance or covered by shadows, making the dubbed voices all too obvious.  The only sound effects in the film are gunshots and vehicles.  No other sounds are heard but the background music which is nonstop throughout.  And of course there's a narrator.  This film needs a narrator like Paris Hilton needs to go on a diet.  The opening scene features a topless woman stangled(I assume by Tor-we don't see anything but shoes and hands) in her home.  This scene was thrown in just for the sake of having a scene with a topless woman, which was probably quite taboo at the time.  It makes no sense otherwise coz Tor's monster is ""born"" in the desert and dies there.  When the hell did he make a special trip to some chick's apartment?  And why does this scene take place before Tor is transformed?  Take into consideration that I love bad B pictures, and when I say that one is terrible, you know it's really gotta suck.

985869,3,6305161518,"""Touch a button and things happen...a scientist becomes a beast!"" With that, the narrator attempts in vain to explain what is going on in the plot. I will confess here and now that I have absolutely no idea what this film is about. It is a Coleman Francis/Anthony Cardoza masterpiece that brings the luminary acting skills of Tor Johnson to bear as a scientist-monster who has something to do with the first landing on the moon (there's this flag there, see, and these Hungarian agents in Yucca Flats to get a briefcase, and, wait...no, that doesn't make any sense...) and nuclear testing. Somewhere along the way Tor becomes evil, starts killing people (I still do not understand how he kills a man who is working on his car, then gets inside the backseat of the car to attack the wife without her noticing), and tangles with the law. Ultimately he gets to pet a cute rabbit and the movie abruptly ends.

There are also subplots about two kids and their Dad (I think) running around lost in the desert trying to avoid Tor and the homely sniper in the airplane who appears to shoot at random people. There is the largish woman in severe horn-rimmed glasses also out in the desert providing more suspense (allegedly) while subplots about policemen and paratroopers are explained in vivid, though un-lucid, detail.

This brings me to the Distinctive Francis-isms that really set Coleman's films apart. While ""Red Zone Cuba"" is still the most confusing of the Francis films, this borrows from the ""Red Zone Cuba"" production notes. All dialogue is very badly dubbed (even worse than in ""Red Zone Cuba"") and the movie is entirely narrated with sentence fragments that shed no light on the onscreen action whatsoever, but do serve to provoke paroxysms of laughter when things like ""man's inhumanity to man"" are brought up. The editing is also what you would expect from Coleman, which is to say, use every scrap of celluloid exposed, but arrange all the scenes in a random order with no explanation of what is being viewed or why. The entire film appears to have been made in the same locations, and with the same props and people, largely, as ""Red Zone Cuba"" (and ""The Skydivers"") down to the same mangy Cessna 182 (which MST fans will recognize as ""Petey the Plane"") and cars of the ""ponderous hugemobile"" variety.

This is one of the most ineptly crafted films of all time, and helps Coleman Francis hold onto his title of worst director ever in my book. ""Plan 9"" is a well-crafted Oscar contender by comparison.

I give the film three stars. This was a tough call, because the film deserves a ranking far into the negative integers, but most people will watch the movie intentionally to see how truly awful it is. Because it really is quite unexpectedly horrendous, even for hardened fans of bad cinema, I compromised on three stars, but beauty, and in this case, ugliness, is in the eye of the beholder. Decide for yourself. At least it is mercifully short at 54 minutes running time.

I recommend this film to people who have successfully made it through ""Red Zone Cuba,"" with the warning that it has the potential to take away your will to live.",1132790400,5,3146,4.702359346642468

No, not G.W. Bush, it's Tor Johnson!

There are some true quandaries in this 'movie' such as:

1.  The narrator slurs his words, is he drunk?

2.  Whenever Tor moves he looks in pain, did he have a back problems?  And if so how long did it take him to get off the toilet?

3.  When Tor mouths something, are they real words? `I ugh Tor ugh.' Or `Tor crush ugh.'

4.  Is Tor Johnson even human?  What the hell are those knots on his head?

5.  How much did Tor get paid for this movie? $10, $20 maybe $50?

6.  If you start running will some one shoot you?

I saw this two nights ago by myself, after getting it in a box collection.  I beg of you not to make the same mistake I made!  The movie should come with a warning:

Warning: 'Watching this movie alone can cause physical harm!'

I mean...it...was...painful.  Like swallowing broken glass or a box of tacks.  But the story doesn't end there. A friend of mine came over to watch some movies, to get into the upcoming Halloween spirit.  And after several attempts to try and get him to pick something I threatened him with the worst movie ever made and he said, 'Worse than Plan 9?'.  I told him Plan 9 was like Citizen Kane compared to this movie.  He wouldn't heed my threats or warnings, so the night after I saw it by myself, I ended watching it again but this time something amazing happened...it was hilarious.  It was absolutely hilarious, we laughed so hard our sides hurt.

The movie itself deserves a zero but fun the factor is off the scale for the veteran sfi-fi/fanatasy/horror fan that is quick with a witty remark and can embrace the carnival bizarre.

The Beast of Yucca Flats is easily more inept than anything Ed Wood ever did (and, appropriately, one of the stars of Yucca Flats is Tor Johnson, who is better known as one of the monsters in Wood's legendary Plan 9 From Outer Space).  But even though the movie is less than an hour long, it's staggeringly boring for most of that time, with only a few enjoyably awful things to keep the attention of the bad movie fan.  One is that no microphones were used to make the movie -- all the soundtrack is done by voice-over, even the dialogue.  Francis narrates the movie in a grim, ponderous monotone, repeatedly making random comments involving the word ""progress"".  The most hilarious of these comes when two young boys ""not yet caught in the whirlwind of progress, feed soda pop to [some] thirsty pigs"" (I am not making this up).  Francis also has a fascination with parachuting (a subject he explored in his next film, ""The Skydivers""), despite the fact that it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot.  Another fun touch is that because of the lack of microphones, whenever characters do speak to one another the camera studiously avoids looking at their faces.  But in general, this movie is a waste of time for anyone who isn't a very hard-core bad movie fan.  You have been warned.",1092787200,,1350,4.568464730290456

This film was shot without sound for whatever reason. There is just some voice over hear and there. Our narrator sounds like your favorite high school teacher who spoke in monotone. I have not counted how many times he said the word 'progress', but whenever he spoke you knew it was coming.
There is no acting in this film at all except for people pretending to die. 99% of this movie is people walking around aimlessly. The housewife probably didn't even know she was being filmed half the time. People have asked about the rabbit at the end. Simple. Someone aimed in the camera on a rabbit running along. Someone thought it would be a good idea to get some interaction with Tor and the rabbit. Effective? Hardly. Thought provoking? Uh-uh. Pointless? Absolutly.

985956,1,6305161518,"Yawn. I love 'bad' monster movies, but this one is very dull. The DVD packaging suggests a color film. The actual film is black & white - so what, just fine with me. (I'm not picky with my Z-flicks...) What I am picky about is fun. As stupid & inept as this film is, I was too bored to laugh or even chuckle after the first 10 minutes. Boring images of a monster and his chasers running around in a drab hilly desert. With only scraps of  narration and ho-hum music. Sounds dull? It really is, capturing none of the inspirational desert horror of 'Eegah!'. (Oh my 'Eegah!', still my vote for the 'Lawrence of Arabia' of awful monster/desert movies...)
I never dreamed I would write this, but Tor Johnson's work in this film is sub-par in comparison with his loftier garbage-bag films for registered trash icon Ed Wood. Tor's Monster has no flimsy tombstones to knock over, no drugged Bela Lugosi to attack, no dialogue to destroy. Without Ed Wood's brave inept hand, Tor seems lost.
'The Beast of Yucca Flats' is boring. A dull film with almost no sound is about as worthwhile as a kid's home movie. You wouldn't watch that, and you shouldn't buy this.",1015545600,7,1152,4.511961722488039
985957,4,6305161518,"Where does one begin in describing this movie? I must second all the other reviewer's comments on this one. Even fans of Ed Wood films will find their mouths dropping open in astonishment at the ineptness of this movie. Count how many ways they (hilariously) try to hide the fact that there's no synchronized sound; decide for yourself if Tor or the heroine is more hideous; thrill to the leaden pacing (even at 54 minutes, you'll be checking your watch); listen in horror as the narrator urges ""our hero"" to hunt down and kill an innocent man; imagine why the producers chose to open what is essentially a ""kiddie matinee""-type movie with a rape/murder (??) featuring frontal nudity; and cringe at the same annoying stock music cues heard in numerous no-budget productions (Atomic Brain and Astounding She Monster leap to mind), recycled here once again. Cataloging this movie's deficiencies would take, well, about 54 minutes. But is it entertaining? Even though I tried to warn her off, my wife (whose tolerance for this sort of thing is not as highly developed as my own) sat in with me on this one, laughed hysterically throughout, and at one point, when I tactfully suggested she make her escape, declared,""No, I'm really enjoying this one."" An unsolicited (and completely unexpected) testimonial. If you're a bad film fan you really owe it to yourself to see this one before you die.
The DVD presentation, spare though it is (no trailers, chapter stops only), still amounts to overkill in this case. The print used is pristine (as claimed on the DVD box). If you watch closely you will find some very light speckling and scratching here and there but otherwise the print's sharp and clean, with good tonal values and detail. Kind of compares to hanging some old stinky sneakers in the Louvre. A commentary would have been welcome (somebody has some 'splainin to do), not to mention a trailer or two, but just the fact that this rarely-seen movie (and I use the word loosely) has been preserved for future generations is reason enough to thank Image for showing the love.

7884876,2,6305161518,"UGH!

The best part of this stinker is Lanell Cado's short nude scene at the very beginning. It lasts about 90 or seconds and yes she is fully nude. You can't really see anything but her breasts but since I had never seen this scene it really caught my attention.

Of course WHY this movie even has a short nude scene is not the only question about this movie. The biggest one is how did they raise the $34,000 or so to make this pile of crap.

But I digress - this very short movie (barely 54 minutes) is about a famous and 'respected' Soviet scientist defecting to the USA with moon flight, etc secrets. He, somehow, ends up close to a nuclear bomb test site and instead of being killed by the radiation he changes in a killer beast (ALA to a great extant The Hulk). He then wonders around killing a few people then is shot and the movie is over. Very little happens- very little is explained - in fact there is very little dialog. There is far too much narration that made no more sense than the rest of the movie unless it's goal is to irritate the viewer.

If that's the case then the voice over is successful.

The only good thing about this movie is I can now say I've seen it and warn other people to avoid it. Watching paint dry in a pitch black room by yourself would be better - in fact far better.

The nude scene was kind of intriguing and there VERY short snippets that were almost interesting. So maybe 3 to 4 minutes out of 54 minutes were worth while. The other 50 or so minutes were completely of no value.

At least I can say I've watched this pile of crap but I will never re-watch this like I have for Plan 9, etc..

I would rate this a 2.75 to 3.25 out of 10. The picture was fairly good - sound was bad to fair. I watched this on Amazon Prime with no real problems.",1477008000,,1788,4.103151862464183

There are so many plot holes, people who die and come back to life; cheap camera angles of an airplane that are obviously filmed from the ground; lengthy chase scenes where people run away from nothing; pointless and run out plot loops. Hell, they didn't even film with audio, they dubbed it later. This was common back in the day, but they get around the lip syncing issue by simple making everyone speak away from the camera.

This is an hour of your life that you won't get back, and getting paid to watch it would still leave you feeling cheated. Just don't bother watching this... thing.
