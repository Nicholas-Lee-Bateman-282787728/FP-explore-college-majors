But considering that the latest release from the studio is double the price of the last release, and that they're parcelling them out in minescule amounts so they make themselves even more money, this is worth the guilt! This collection furthers the story line with Ichigo and the others still after Aizen,and does include Ichigo's entire battle with Grimmjaw, which is epic. It is well worth the money!",1242000000,,445,5.027027027027027
