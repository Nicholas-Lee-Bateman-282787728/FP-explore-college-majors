8272389,3,B00197XF7S,This was good when it actually was filmed but not in todays time. But the information they were telling was worth listening to. This is a classic because of the time though.,1391126400,,173,4.4375
8272390,5,B00197XF7S,Loved this set.  It has all the beauty and elegance of a concert.  Photography is gorgeous and very well done. Great set to have for any family.l,1390608000,,145,4.333333333333333
8272391,5,B00197XF7S,"In contrast to the other guy who bought this DVD set I happen to enjoy this stuff. These were episdoes made by John Stoneman and his crew the Team For Ocean Research. The quality is what you would expect for a late 80's and ealier show but you get over 10 hours of film at this low rate and that is a bargin. The other great thing about it is the interaction and educational aspects of things you see. No ofcourse this is not blu ray or high def in anyway but you have to consdier the time period he did this in. Also you have to consider that what my colllegue over here is saying are overlapping episodes are actually not. This man travels around the world and often does several expeditions (epidsodes) in the same area but on very different things. I will agree this is not up to Discovery channel standards of today with all the high tech stuff. But for what you pay for it, it's a great deal and I found no problem with how the item was boxed. This is very educational and great stuff. It really got me back into Discovery channel stuff and dvds of the ocean and sharks and all kinds of stuff that I use to like when I was a kid, but just forgot about as an adult and lost time for. I think it's worth it's price. Hope you enjoy it.",1245110400,9,1238,4.098765432098766
8272392,4,B00197XF7S,"My first impression of this set was not so good.  Picture and sound quality show their age  - this show originally aired in the mid to late 80's, therefore the information presented is also dated.  Over the years though, I've come to develop a fondness for this series - when warm weather comes around and I bring out my collection of marine life documentaries this one is one that I look forward to viewing.  If you like this set, also check out another Madacy set, Predators of the Deep.",1219622400,8,489,4.46067415730337
