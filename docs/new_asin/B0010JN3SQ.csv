8237913,3,B0010JN3SQ,"This is a trivial little movie, and it's no wonder it never was released in the US, because we have many of the same kind of movies.  A piecemeal plot that is strung together with unlikely reasoning.  If any of the characters actually thought this through then there wouldn't be so many plot holes.  It is hard to believe most of the way through the film.

It is delightful to watch Dylan Moran play so many different roles, but the comedy is hit or miss.  Although I must say that Michael Caine and Dylan Moran play off each other very well.

This is a good movie to watch if you want to watch something which doesn't make much sense, but want to go along for the ride, because you like the character actors that are involved, Michael Gambon, Lena Headey, Miranda Richardson, and, of course, the two leads, Michael Caine and Dylan Moran.",1385942400,,838,4.444444444444445
8237914,5,B0010JN3SQ,"This is an excellent movie. If your from America and don't have a region 2 player, I recomend you get one so you can watch this movie. Michael Caine and Dylan Moran deliver stunning performaces. The overall premise is painfully funny. Very good!",1213747200,2,245,4.72093023255814
