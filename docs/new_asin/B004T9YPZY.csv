Taking place in Paris immediately following the Franco-Prussian War, the show is steeped in the mores of the period, and it does well in transporting you into that world. The story is centered around a particular government-run bordello, or ""maison close,"" named Paradis (I don't know if ""Paradis"" existed in history, but the characters at times mention a competing brothel, ""le Chabanais,"" which did exist in Paris, and was quite famous).

There is a fair amount of depth to the plot, and if you are paying attention to the subtitles instead of the subtleties, it's easy to miss the facial expressions and mannerisms that help to tell the story, and you're likely to miss some understanding of why characters behave as they do towards one another. At times Maison Close resembles a sophisticated soap opera, but there is an insightful intelligence to it that usually lifts it well above lesser dramas. This series could have been so bad, but the quality of the acting, the sets, and sometimes the dialogue ended up with me giving the season 5 stars.

It's distressing to watch how Rose (Jemima West) is forcibly inducted into the bordello; I imagine how this scenario could have happened given the circumstances in 1871, so I don't have any reason to doubt the portrayal by the screenwriters as anything but realistic for the period.

While the adult nature of the premise ensures nudity, the sexual content here isn't more graphic than what is seen in a typical HBO drama. Speaking of HBO, Maison Close is on par with that level of programming (it aired on Canal+, a French premium cable TV channel).

There isn't much room for humor in Maison Close, but they still manage to pull it off tastefully on random occasions. The most memorable example is a visiting Dr Lombardi who pokes and prods our heroines and then informs them of some conclusions from his research; the good doctor gets his just desserts after presenting his biased, half-baked findings.

Overall, this first season of 8 episodes is a forbidding yet addictive show to delve into. Despite murder, mayhem, and the unfortunate exploitation of prostitution, Maison Close doesn't leave you in a pool of misery after indulging in it.",1413504000,,2281,4.865979381443299
