The name is in the yellow star and you click on the name to get to the individual combos. Also on the root menu is extras. Clicking on the name leads you into a page that has the combo's and performance. Each instructor has 5 combinations.

The combo's have included in them

Demonstration- a demonstration of the combination being taught.

 Instruction- the breakdown of what was in the combination. In this section you also get a chance to practice  before moving into the follow along section which is pretty brief.
  Follow along- The combination is performed a couple of times with you following along. There is nothing said. No one counts out steps or anything like that, you just dance along to the music as they are doing on screen.
  The demonstration,instruction, and follow along are not broken down in any menu section but if you press the forward or backward button on your dvd player you can hit each one.
 Followed by a complete performance. The performance did not include the combination taught but was an entirely separate  performance. The total running time of the dvd is 157minutues. That is a lot of instruction. Some of the combinations were longer than others but each one was a decent length with a lot of moves thrown in. Ava had the longest combination sections.

  In Ava's first combination she had a variations section. I would describe Ava's section and her dance style as sharp then fluid. If you have ever seen Ava dance then that is exactly what you are getting in her combo's. I did not care for the performance piece  and only enjoyed combo's 3 and 4 but I did get something different from every combination she taught. Ava's performance was cabaret style .

  In Sadie's combo one and two, she has a front view and back view in the follow along. Sadie offers you floorwork, drum solo and veil work in her pieces. I loved her performance and I must say the costume she wore was gorgeous. I enjoyed combo's 2 and 3. Sadie uses her signature style, but for some reason most of the combo's seemed softer more cabar-ish than normal. Still enjoyed them. Sadies performance was a cabaret style performance .

  Kaya also uses a veil and she stays true to kaya and Sadie pops, locks and shimmies style fusing it a bit with hip hop but not enough that you will notice offhand. Her musical selections were different than Sadie's and Ava who both used more traditional music. Kaya used 80's and very funky music in her pieces. Kaya reminds me of Suhaila Salimpour, you can see that the technique is there but its more of a loose joyful technique than a precise technique and its good they put her in the mix to add something different. Kaya's performance was a drum solo and it was okay.

  I liked this dvd. Every person had something different to offer  but the technique is still there. Ava's teaching style was okay but Sadie and Kaya used there signature teaching styles and were more in depth than Ava's. They told about the music and rhythms that were used in some pieces; that I really enjoyed. In some of Sadie's and Kaya's combo's some of the moves were in performances that I have saw before but that was okay because the content never once overlapped with combinations from their previous dvd's. I do not have any of Ava Flemings dvd's so I cannot tell you whether the combo's overlap with other ones.

  This is not a beginners dvd and I would say it's for a strong intermediate to advanced. Things are not precisely broken down and even though they explain things very well some of the layers will be hard to get and every combo in this dvd has layers. This is a dvd that you will need to cut off and drill. I enjoyed this dvd and think its  worth the money if you enjoy all of their styles and wanted some fresh combo's to use in your dance. For the most part they stayed true to their signature styles. This is not a drill dvd. If you are looking for a dvd that will help with technique this is not the dvd to get. I think this dvd is worth it, and I am happy to add it to my collection.

In the extra's section there are
