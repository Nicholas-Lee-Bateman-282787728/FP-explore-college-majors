7664473,4,B01BN52ZIU,I wish it had more Elmo. My daughter loves anything with Elmo but is bored by all the clips that didn't have Elmo in it. Its not bad but we have to skip through about 1/2 of the clips since they don't have Elmo.,1467158400,,211,3.8181818181818183

8750802,3,B01BN52ZIU,"I bought this for my daughter who now likes Elmo. There are definitely some parts where she ""checks out"" and others which engage her a lot. She enjoys music so this video provides more of that than other Elmo videos.",1503273600,,216,4.425
8750803,1,B01BN52ZIU,Waste of money. It starts off with singing and newer looking Elmo clips and ends up in a mash up of old Sesame Street episodes from the early nineties and has hardly any singing. My toddler lost interest within 2 minutes.,1497312000,,221,4.414634146341464

8750810,1,B01BN52ZIU,"I bought this video for my 16-month old son because it has the word ""sing"" in the title.  He hates the car, and the only thing that keeps him semi-happy are videos with lots of music.  I was so disappointed to find that most of the music is concentrated at the beginning of the movie, and the rest is just random Sesame Street scenes put together to make a ""movie.""  He hates it.  NOT worth $10.",1481155200,,395,4.157894736842105
