8038802,3,B00065BENG,"A good intro to this art. It does demonstrate standing forms. However some of it is hard to understand. It does not go into great depth, I think more information would have been helpful for the price.",1394582400,,200,4.4324324324324325
8038803,5,B00065BENG,"He likes it!

Having watched the video, I can attest that Li Jiang Yu has a lot of power and fighting skill.  I actually felt sorry for the guy he was demonstrating on.
  In terms of the quality of the video, the best analogy for it is:  You're exploring a cave and come across a wall carved with instructions for the art of Yiquan.  Everything is as concise as can be: just some images and terse instructions.
  Master Li covers all aspects of the art as best as anyone could in 57 minutes.  The biggest omission is a lack of discussion on ""Internal"" principles.  All I heard was a quick mention of ""Soong"" (Relax); but these principles could be picked up in any good book on genuine Internal Martial Arts.
  About the excessively repetitive movements (Mo Ca Bu/Stepping, etc), Master Li covers all the details and important aspects of the movements but only once for the most part.  If you think these details and applications aren't important then just try fighting without them!
  This video is probably best for a person already learning from an Yiquan teacher as a concise overview of the art or for the person who wants a concise overview of the art.  If you're looking to train and master Yiquan from this video then you have A LOT of work ahead of you.",1215043200,2,1261,4.488986784140969
8038804,3,B00065BENG,I found this DVD useful in understanding the basics of Yi Chuan. There are many exercise that can be used to develop Chi Power and that in and of itself makes it a worthwhile buy.,1173312000,,179,4.142857142857143
8038805,5,B00065BENG,"This offering is likely to be of limited benefit for people just starting out in the internal martial arts as explanations are kept to a minimum. People with a more substantial background will be in a better position to appreciate the nuances of Master Li Jiang Yu's demonstration and to learn from them. Even so, an attentive and open-minded beginner can expect to gain just by attending to the external details of Master Li's performance and modeling on them. Traditional training in internal gong fu proceeds on much this basis, with the teacher providing occasional input as the student appears ready with much practice and inner research. Even then, however, the old Confucian adage applies: ""When I have presented one corner of a subject to any one, and he cannot from it learn the other three, I do not repeat my lesson.""

NO DVD or video presentation can be expected to substitute for the living presence and input of a qualified teacher. Still, it's always to the serious student's great good fortune to be able to watch someone of Li Jiang Yu's caliber demonstrate their art. For that reason, five stars.",1169596800,2,1114,4.832460732984293
8038806,1,B00065BENG,"I wish the prior review had been here before I ordered this dvd.  There isn't any instruction here just a demonstration.  This is a really poorly done dvd as well.  I have no doubt the instructor knows what he is doing and can exact a great deal of damage but he doesn't teach you how to do it.  The internal martial arts have many subtle movements and explanations that are completely missed without at least some discourse.  If you know what the instructor is doing you don't need this dvd; if you don't know exactly what this instructor is doing then you won't learn a single thing here.  Save your money and try to find a qualified teacher, though it's next to impossible in the u.s. .",1169251200,10,689,4.3858267716535435
8038807,2,B00065BENG,"The only thing that might be useful in this DVD is watching the movements performed by a very experienced person. But why spend your money on that single fact? the narrator gives a terrible overview of the martial art's history. Yi Quan is supposed to view martial arts as a science, and there is too much of a mystical tone in health section. When the master speaks, you don't understand a word he says. There is no explanation to anything; the postures are just shown (no suggestion on how long to do it, a normal person would hold hat for 5 seconds like him, or what to work on during those postures), and during motsapu, the master just repeats 1,2,3 like a million times. not very illuminating... during fa li he does about 2 different movements, and repeats the a million times, no wonder the video lasts an hour, there are many more movements than that. same thing for the apllications part. It's an internal martial art!! one cannot teach that with such little explanation. anyway, much more to say, but what's the point. i'll try one of the DVD's of the school in beijing,  hope they are more proffessional.",1169078400,3,1116,4.58
8038808,5,B00065BENG,"Master Li Jiang Yu's DVD ""Tao of Yi Chuan"" is probably the cream of the crop in Martial Art DVDs. It is such a treat to learn from one of the rare surviving 2nd generation Yi Chuan master.

Yi Chuan is a rare martial art noted for its simplicity,  tremendous health benefits and stunningly powerful fighting techniques. However, with the passing away of founder Wang Xiang Zhay and most of his students, this art is quickly become an endangered species.  Master Li Jiang Yu's DVD will help to preserve this art.

I personally am not fortunate enough to learn from Master Li Jiang Yu.  I learned  Yi Chuan, first from the late Master Lee Ying-arng in Hong Kong and then from the late Dr. Yu Peng Si and his wife Min Ouyang in San Francisco, all were senior students of Wang Xiang Zhay.

Master Li Jiang Yu's DVD contains everything in Yi Chuan, including Standing Meditation, Testing of force, Footwork, Push hands, Power release or Issuing force, Animal Play and many self defense techniques. Master Li is very generous in sharing Yi Chuan's secrets. Nothing is left out! The DVD is also enjoyable to watch. It has beautiful music background, set in the scene of an oriental garden in Beijing, with Master Li standing in the rain. Master Li gives instruction in English and Mandarin Chinese, with further clarification in English by a narrator. Master Li's demonstation of using relaxation and no muscular force to neutralize and uproot an opponent much heavier is very impressive.",1143417600,6,1481,4.784313725490196
8038809,5,B00065BENG,"I've been practicing Kung Fu and internal arts for about 41 years. After watching this video I realized that I had learned bits and pieces of Yi-chuan from three teachers. This put it all together.

Master Li is a perfect example of an old school master: very well trained and, at near 80 years old, phenomenal. He is an inspiration to any martial artist.

The video is an excellent reference on basic Yi-chuan, but better suited to advanced students with some background in internal arts. The reason I say this is because little explanation of the moves, chi circulation, breathing, etc. is provided. Experienced practitioners will understand the nuances from watching it...

This is one of the best videos on internal arts that I have seen in years. A definite buy.",1125619200,12,767,4.8396946564885495
8038810,5,B00065BENG,"I do not have access to a teacher of Yi Chuan/i Chuan/ Da Cheng Quan. This movie is a good reference for people like me. Master Li is very impressive for someone 40 years old, even though he is almost 80 in this video. He speaks in chinese and english, but it is hard to understand a lot of what he says because he has a mic taped to him. He covers all of the basics in the video. The health stances, the combat stances, the stepping and moving, the fa li and he shows pushing hands and applications with a partner. The video was remade from a VHS video so the quality is not DVD, but it is still very good. I wish there were some more videos of Master Li, especially more instructional explanations. But this video is still very good.

If you are like me, and do not have access to a good teacher, then I highly recommend this video for your reference. I would also recommend Sifu Fong Ha's Yiquan DVD for you as well.",1124582400,11,919,4.134078212290503
