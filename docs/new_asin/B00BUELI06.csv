5674934,2,B00BUELI06,".and by that that I mean, do not miss a a cameo by my favorite French actress Fanny Ardant. It's worth the rental.",1394668800,,114,4.0
5674935,3,B00BUELI06,"The best I can say is, it could have been less confusing if it had more character development. More believable if they had checked how much damage the sniper rifle depicted would really do. By the looks of that rifle, and the shear size of the bullet and casing, a lot more damage than depicted (or) the special effects were just shabby?",1394668800,,337,4.451612903225806
5674936,4,B00BUELI06,"if you like french films and police action dramas this is very entertaining

note a famous french actress has a surprise cameo",1392595200,,126,4.7272727272727275
5674937,1,B00BUELI06,"Let me start by saying that Daniel Auteuil is one of my very favorite actors, and I do watch violent material (for instance, I watched and loved the 1st two seasons of Spiral). However, even with good acting, this movie was too violent for me. I  don't think the violence was gratuitous, but the whole movie was negative and violent. I can't say it was a bad film, but for me it was not a good experience (though I did watch it to the end).",1392508800,11,440,4.176470588235294
5674938,5,B00BUELI06,Well thought out. gave it a good rating because I liked it. acting was good. nice twist and turns to the movie.,1391299200,,111,4.090909090909091
5674939,1,B00BUELI06,Moved slow. The movie had the feel of a whole bunch of five minutes skits tied together.  I am a big heist-movie fan.  I just didn't enjoy this one.,1390694400,,148,4.068965517241379
5674940,5,B00BUELI06,"Great French movie, excellent acting, Mostly filmed in Paris, Both sides have equal time and if you love subtitles (which I do) this film is a thrilling experience! Excellent et tres bien.",1390089600,,188,4.90625
5674941,4,B00BUELI06,"A heist, a sniper. a police officer is about to cath the team, something is out of control. Then inside the gang, someone steals the money, and behind the doublecrosses and betrayal, the spiral of violence is about to grow.

Well edited and better directed, Daniel Auteil makes a worthy acting as well as the rest of the cast.

The plot runs about 85 minutes. There's lot of memorable sequences. Don't miss it.",1387152000,3,410,4.602739726027397
8574021,3,B00BUELI06,"The plot is weak and the story confusing with many twists that just come out of the blue for no good reasons.
It's difficult to follow who are the characters.
And besides the 3 main actors, all the others are  pretty much indistinguishable from one another.
In the end we had a good time making fun of the movie as we were watching it as the story jumps around and stops making sense.",1523836800,,384,4.260273972602739
8574022,1,B00BUELI06,Yawn!,1518307200,,5,5.0
8574023,5,B00BUELI06,"Awesome, tons of plot twists, with an earnest glimpse into both the most debased and most moral nature of human behaviour. Gripping and beautifully acted and shot.",1495411200,,163,5.074074074074074
8574024,4,B00BUELI06,good french action flick ....surprising how good most of them are now that I see them on amazon....a little hard to follow the plot but maybe that is the french names ..who is who doing what etc ...but it was first class stuff,1483142400,,226,4.27906976744186
8574025,4,B00BUELI06,"Very good ""French film""!  Deep and dark and suspenseful! Daniel Auteuil at his best!",1433116800,,84,5.0
8574026,2,B00BUELI06,"Poorly written, even worse directed, with flashy unjustified plot points, contrived and ultimately pretty obviosus plot. Daniel Aueteuil is miscast, Kassowitz performance couldn't be outstiffened by a wooden mannequin. Characters don't stay in character... What a mess. Two starts only because of the uncredited Fanny Ardant cameo, which is not particularly good, but in the total desolation of this move felt like a breath of fresh air.",1423353600,,437,5.537313432835821
8574027,5,B00BUELI06,"a great human interest story, character driven, worthwhile watching.",1418860800,,68,6.666666666666667
8574028,2,B00BUELI06,"Lots of guns, guts, blood, car crashes.  The stuff of which Americans call entertainment, which is why I generally prefer foreign movies.  Less gore.

Not so this one plus the 'plot' was thin, which upped the 'ho-hum' factor for me.

I would not buy it, rent it or watch it again.

Disappointing since I do like Daniel Auteuil",1401062400,,326,4.551724137931035
8574029,5,B00BUELI06,"A gritty, bank robbery, crime-driven drama with lots of plot twists that will keep you guessing until the end.  What did I like about this movie?  For one, the acting and direction is outstanding -- believable, realistic and uncompromising.  The plot is original and has many layers and themes (greed, betrayal, revenge, duty, justice, acceptance.) It is a dark movie with a few graphically violent scenes, (shooting, stabbing, killing and brief nudity) which in my opinion were not gratuitous, but seem rather expected in a movie of this genre.  Overall, a thrilling ride and worth the price of the rental.  You may like this movie if you are a fan of French cinema, or enjoy crime dramas, are a Daniel Auteuil fan or are looking for engaging adrenaline rush. This movie is in French with English subtitles.",1399593600,4,808,4.868613138686132
8574030,2,B00BUELI06,"the movie is closer to 4 stars as it mixes 3 genres which i've never seen combined before:  robbery, sniper & serial killer

more background info would have been helpful as to the 3 special ops & what happened to the 3rd & was police rifleman killed by auteuil, etc

the dvd quality is really only 1 star as the entire movie is made up some of the worst digital artifacts i've seen outside of intentional special effects like disaster movies or cronenberg's naked lunch, etc  - it was extremely distracting to have buildings & scenery constantly vibrating as if watching an earthquake so hopefully if this company makes any more dvd's they will improve their digital process & stabilize immobile objects.  of course, that unfortunate digital transfer accidental addition could have been an interesting dimension if the buildings & scenery really had been shaking by intent since then a 4th genre of film would have been in play!",1399593600,,928,4.811320754716981
