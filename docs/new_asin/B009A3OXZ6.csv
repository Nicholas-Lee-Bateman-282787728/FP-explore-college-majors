I was so happy when I found it on Amazon because I searched everywhere for a version that would 1) work in the U.S. and 2) have Japanese audio with English subtitles but couldn't find one. So, I resorted to watching lower quality, and sometimes incomplete versions online.  I'm so happy now that I own my own personal version and can watch it whenever I want in great quality! Also, Asian Mall was very quick with sending out the DVD. I ordered this movie Feb. 4th and it arrived Feb. 6th. Awesome! If you're in the U.S. it 100% works with your DVD player. From the menu go to ""Set up"" then select Japanese under ""Sound"" and then select English under ""Subtitle"", then select ""Play Movie"" and your all set! If you've never seen this movie, I highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed! So beautiful.",1487203200,,943,4.419540229885057
