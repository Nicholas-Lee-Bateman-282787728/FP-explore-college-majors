7601336,2,B01AHNJQIQ,This was an OK DVD to remember the Denver Broncos win Super Bowl 50.  I was a bit disappointed in the extra features.  Not a lot of substance there.  I was also disappointed that you don't get the whole Super Bowl game.  You get very few highlights of each game played.  Sound and picture were fine.  The quality of content was not worth the price at all.,1484956800,,355,4.223880597014926

7601346,2,B01AHNJQIQ,"Although I appreciated the recap pf the Super Bowl Season I wanted more footage of the actual Super Bowl.  It was well put together by NFL films, every Bronco Fan will appreciate watching this video.  I would have given it 4 1/2 stars except for some reason it is formatted such that the picture does not fill my entire screen on my 75"" TV.  It is in a 16:9 format and during playback the picture is displayed no larger than 65"" on my 75"" Samsung 4K Ultra UHD TV (with a black border filling in the rest of the screen).  Maybe I should buy a new Blue Ray DVD player and buy this video in Blue Ray and see if the picture fills the screen on my TV.  Can't explain it.  Good video though",1474848000,,684,4.067164179104478

7601350,5,B01AHNJQIQ,thank you so much for delivering the product on time.  the dvd summed up the broncos season with good defense.  what I did not realize was the part that showed that the panther players were saying the broncos defense was pretty good.,1474329600,,233,4.523809523809524

I bought this for a party I had for my tailgate this weekend, and didn't realize it until we put the DVD in.

There are about 15 minutes of Super Bowl 50 outtakes and highlights and about 5 - 10 minute outtakes and highlights from all previous games in the season. If that is what you are looking for, then look no further. If you want to watch Super Bowl 50 in its entirety, you have to wait for the NFL Network to air it as a rerun.",1462320000,3,391,3.962025316455696

7601403,2,B01AHNJQIQ,"There were some genuinely nice moments captured from behind or Mic'd up that couldn't have been gotten during the game. HOWEVER, that said I missed part of the Super Bowl due to being a cruise in International waters so parts were not broadcast. As such I wanted to get a copy of it.  I have yet to see the game all the way through as it was broadcast and I would like that.  I also don't understand why we didn't get much behind the scenes such as seeing Kubiak doing locker room talk to the guys after the game or something.  It was underwhelming.  And the added features of Broncos Super Bowl Sound Archive was from previous Broncos Super Bowl not this one so I don't even get the point of it being on here.",1459641600,11,710,4.237037037037037

7601405,3,B01AHNJQIQ,"This review is based on the content of this presentation, being a Broncos fan obviously the outcome of the season was fantastic.  I would have rated this DVD 2  stars if Amazon gave that ability in rating.  Before I start, why is there not a Road to (Super Bowl 50) with the playoff games and Super Bowl like with previous seasons?

So the last time I purchased and watched an NFL Films packaging of a Super Bowl season was for the Broncos Super Bowl XXXII season.  Sadly NFL Films has not improved on their styleat all.  Im glad there are DVRs so fans can keep games recorded (if they did so).  So the style of the highlights of the season are typically disjointed with odd camera angles with unwanted close-ups of crowd reactions and sideline antics, super slow motion, etc.  The highlights don't get into a rhythm or tell the story well. Each game is hardly a highlight as we would typically enjoy from ESPN, etc. and usually doesnt put the context of the game in perspective, but only a key play(s) that resulted in the outcome of the game.  The narration is mainly from the Broncos radio broadcast, thankfully the guys don't get too obnoxious like some local commentators.  The added music in as cheesy as always, but without the classic NFL Films music.  As I mentioned most of the games are disjointed and leave out some plays and facts that were important to a game, or over-emphasize a play or two.  With many of the highlights I was getting irritated saying what about that one play that happened that (resulted in something important)?  Is there a set time limit?  Surely there was enough space to make the highlights more comprehensive and longer.  Basically the season in review was anything but a few bad angles of some key plays that look much better on TV.  If you want to take a trip down memory lane, this is not the best format for you.  Laughable are things like Peytons bad game against the Chiefs and the narration, after kickoff with Manning breaking the all-time yardage record, jumps forward to he was pulled from the game due to injury.  Yes he was, but also because his injuries affected his passing and he threw four picks.  Lost in translation is how the season was almost lost and the Patriots losing as well helped the Broncos.  There certainly was not enough significance placed on the unexpected (but very welcome) return of Peyton Manning as the starter during the season finale against San Diego.  The AFC Championship game and Super Bowl were pretty well done, but Ill take the TV broadcast any day over the odd, lazy style of NFL Films.  The DVD also contains some okay featurettes, but I am very glad they included the trophy presentation since my DVR stopped recording before that.  Its odd that the only TV highlight was the trophy presentation.

NFL Films needs to go back to the drawing board with these Super Bowl Champion videos.  It is a big deal when your team wins it all, and the DVD should pay a very good tribute to that.  I cant say enough their style of reviewing the season pretty much sucks.  I rather have every highlight from ESPN if I could than this.  Again, why is there not a Road to Super Bowl 50 DVD?  I could not have been happier with the outcome of the season for the Denver Broncos and Peyton Manning, but with all the memorabilia I have collected to commemorate this Super season, this video is the worst.  Id say for die-hards only, but I am one, so I guess pay the inflated price for the video for the good and the bad, and the ugly of this presentation.",1459209600,3,3523,4.50236220472441

7601414,5,B01AHNJQIQ,"This DVD was produced by NFL Films and documents the 2015 Denver Broncos season that culminated in their Super Bowl 50 victory.

The DVD traces the path the Broncos trod in their hunt for a third championship. The season was full of ups and downs, but the constant theme is of a defensive unit that consistently outplayed their competitors and anchored the team when the offense was struggling.

Each game during the season is highlighted with film clips and commentary with the usual NFL Films narration, excellent film footage and stirring original music. Unlike the Americas Game series, there are no interviews, but there are a lot clips where a player (Peyton Manning, DeMarcus Ware, Von Miller) was miked up and you get their words while the action was hot and heavy!

I thought it was a balanced production that didn't focus on offense or defense or one player. It correctly highlighted the complete team nature of a season that seemed to have a different hero for each and every game from defensive backs to running backs, QBs (both of them!) to linebackers and every position in between.

Every Broncos, Manning, Ware, etc. fan will love this DVD as I did! The DVD is about one hour and forty minutes long. For those wanting the relive the 2015 Broncos quest for the Lombardi Trophy, this is a must have! Five stars!",1457740800,15,1325,4.7229437229437226

7601425,1,B01AHNJQIQ,"Ok, so there really is no way any review counts since this has not been released. That being said all of the other reviews did not address one important thing, why the hell is Ronnie Hillman on the cover! Should have at least Von Miller, MVP or CJ Anderson if they really wanted a running back. Nothing against Hillman at all, but really? No Von?",1455667200,4,346,4.338461538461538

7601427,5,B01AHNJQIQ,"I'm a hardcore Giants fan and whenever my team is out of it (alot lately) I root against the teams I hate. Out of all the teams this year I hated no one more than the Panthers - smug, immature, and intimidating players on teams with threats of violence via a baseball bat who they felt posed a challenge to their ""perfect"" season. Odell Beckham Jr. was just one of those they went after. Each week of the playoffs the Panthers won I lost more and more hope of them loosing. That all changed when they faced the Broncos!!! It was greast to see a humble team like the Broncos  beat them on the world stage!

CONGRATS TO THE BRONCOS PLAYERS, STAFF, AND
FANS...ON BEHALF OF ALL THE TEAMS THE panthers CHEATED AGAINST THIS YEAR WE ARE TRULY GRATEFUL! This dvd will be in my shelf right next to the one that The Patriots ASSUMED they won before they played! GO BRONCOS! Sorry about XXI",1455321600,76,879,4.321212121212121
