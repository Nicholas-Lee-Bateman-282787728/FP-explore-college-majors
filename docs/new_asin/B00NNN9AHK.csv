The artistic direction toward the end of the movies reminded me the style of August Rush. Although the blind pianist has the predominant interest, but I think Jie's storyline really balance well. Her friendship with Huang gave her the courage and strength to overcome her own obstacles. Instead of just touting this blind pianist as a phenom, the story tells how someone with a disability can excel and be the best that he or she can become.  And that person has plenty of worth to influence the lives of others. Fantastic message for a family to watch, Even though the film is not rated, it is easily a PG rated movie. There is one brief scene when the roommate tried to show him a magazine cover with a lady in a bikini. It is not a porn magazine though. Also later on in one scene, the same roommate referencing a girl's chest.",1516838400,,996,4.533333333333333

It sheds light on what it means to overcome challenges, embrace the situation, and persevere.  Highly recommend watching this film.",1425772800,,283,5.534883720930233
8679317,3,B00NNN9AHK,"Touch of the Light (Ni guang fei xiang) is a 2012 Taiwanese drama based on the life of a blind piano prodigy Huang Yu-Siang (played by himself). Leaving his home behind, he enters a Taipei university to learn music, where he befriends slightly eccentric but musically talented students to form a band Super Music. But it seems there is some sad memory that haunts him.

In the meanwhile, Huang meets Xiao Jie (Sandrine Pinna), an aspiring dancer working in a drink shop, whose life is not going well. She is almost giving up her dream, but Huangs personality inspires her to pursue it once more.

With a half-documentary-like photography Touch of the Light avoids being overly sentimental, opting for more realism. There is a romantic aspect to the story, but emotions are always subdued. Chang Jung-Chis direction works to some extent, with some inspired use of camera capturing how Huang feels things around him.

But I was not impressed with the film, especially the overused shaky camera that gets annoying. Another problem is that the story of Xiao Jie is far less interesting than that of Huang Yu-Siang. After all the latter is inspired by the real events, and played out by the very person who experienced them.

Perhaps my complaint has something to do with the fact that the film originally started as a 2008 short documentary The End of the Tunnel about Huang Yu-Siang. Considering the potential of the subject matter, Chang Jung-Chis feature debut is promising but a bit disappointing.",1393804800,,1497,4.905138339920948
