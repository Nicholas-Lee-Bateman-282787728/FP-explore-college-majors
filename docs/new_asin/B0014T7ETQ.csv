3134197,3,B0014T7ETQ,"I, too, saw this clever piece on Oxygen this past week. It's entertaining, and I'd like to see it as a whole, rather than over two nights and broken up by seemingly infinite commercials.

It doesn't pretend to be yet another remake of P&P, so one can have fun with it; like ""Bride and Prejudice,"" in a way.

No collection of visual Austen artifacts is complete without it! (Or at least having it available at a nearby well-stocked library.)",1231891200,11,440,4.556962025316456
3134198,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I watched this on Oxygen, and it is delightfully done and thought provoking.  The tired-of-her-modern-world protagonist yearns for the world of Jane Austen, when she inadvertently goes through a portal in her bathroom to find herself not only back in time, but in the imaginary world of Pride and Prejudice.  This is a wonderful addition to anyone hungry for more Austenmania.",1231891200,63,376,5.147540983606557
3134199,4,B0014T7ETQ,Fairly funny take on an old favorite. It probably went on a bit longer than it needed to. Thankfully it was interesting enough that you don't get bored. The main actress they chose is also pretty annoying. But it's something I will probably watch again.,1505174400,,253,4.644444444444445
3134200,1,B0014T7ETQ,"If I could give this less stars I would. I LOVE Jane Austen, my Pride and Prejudice novel is falling apart and I love new spins on our beloved book. This however was a dumpster fire that should've never been made. There is only one good thing, it makes you think about what it this. what if that. But I hated it!!! Gave all the characters a bad rep, and I literally couldn't read or watch Pride and Prejudice for a year until this was fully out of my head, I tried and was miserable. Don't watch this.

3134204,3,B0014T7ETQ,"Austen fans will (mostly) love this silly movie, although there are a few inconsistencies with plot.  Who cares - Mr. Darcy is in it!  (Which is probably exactly what the director thought when it came to the final cut).  If you don't mind Jemima Rooper's distracting bangs, the story offers little factoids into life in the Jane Austen era (like brushing your teeth and unusualness of making pubic topiaries).",1495670400,,409,4.898550724637682

3134209,5,B0014T7ETQ,"Love love love this movie! I watch it as much as Pride and Prejudice ( The good one with Colin Firth) now. The story is about a modern day Amanda Price from Hammersmith (not sure if it's spelled correctly) and is obsessed with Jane Austen. Her boyfriend is a turd and I was glad he had a small part. One night, Elizabeth Bennet somehow ends up in the real world through a door in Amanda's bathroom. They switch places. On Amanda's end it seems in the beginning she's going mad and wants to leave. Yada yada yada, and Amanda brings chaos and change to the story. I loved it so much simply because what Austen fan wouldn't want to step into Pride and Prejudice, into Austen's world? It's funny, sweet, painful (Bingley and Janes) And lovely. Mr Collins is not as good as P&P but still is disgusting. I want to step into this novel and I think that if you'd like it as well, this is an interesting and great movie to watch. Darcy is obviously not Colin Firth Darcy, but he's still good. There are subtitles and behind the scenes with interviews with the actors. And let me get this out of the way, Lydia is FAR less annoying and so beautiful. I think they made a risk with this type of twist for P&P, but one that actually worked out. I love the intelligence, the writing is very good. Wickam is redeemed. The only thing I was iffy about was how it came to happen with Darcy's little sister Georgiana. She'd kept the truth a secret and first meeting Amanda she tells all? Hmmunbelievable to tell a stranger the great secret. Still it was very well done. It came on time and perfect condition. First time I saw it on hulu( which btw it's still on there if you want to give it a try first) I knew I needed to add it to my Austen collection.",1481587200,3,1735,4.260606060606061

A renduring of what happens when modern London-ite, Amanda Price trades places with 1800's Elilzabeth Bennet of Hertfordshire is a wonderful mangling of events and people. Everything goes sideways. A must watch for Janites!",1466812800,,289,5.444444444444445
3134228,1,B0014T7ETQ,"So disappointing...not that the directors and producers will care a wit about my opinion, since they've already made bank off this film. I love Jane Austen's novels, and I love many of the riffs on her work, and thought I'd enjoy this one, but at 3 hours it's way too long and at about the 3/4 mark I just had to start fast-forwarding to get through it to the end.

Miss Price, as she's called by the Austen-era characters, can't possibly have read ""Pride and Prejudice"" given that she doesn't appear to have the ability to edit her words or her actions as she rampages through the characters' world. She'd be considered an amazingly irritating loose-cannon of a houseguest even today. At one point she excuses something Darcy says when he appears briefly in the 21st century and comments on a bus passenger as ""Tourette's""; Miss Price herself appears to suffer from this condition throughout the entire movie.

The tone of the humor is set early on when she flashes the camera she thinks must be hidden in her Regency room. Austen's characters are twisted beyond all recognition. There are bits of sly humor--Darcy appearing in a white shirt in a pond at Miss Price's request is amusing--but I kept feeling the presence of a certain void, that somehow the writers were missing out on great opportunities. There just wasn't the deft touch that this sort of spin on Austen needs to make it one for the ages. I guess they just wanted one for the quick box-office revenue.

It was fun to see Hugh Bonneville as Mr. Bennett, though.",1466035200,2,1528,4.651851851851852

3134245,4,B0014T7ETQ,"Let me start off by saying this movie was wonderful. It certainly felt that they could have continued this story with a sequel that would be equal enjoyable. However, I took away one star in my rating and only have it a four for some of the language that was used. Jane Austen's work is honest and innocent and to mesh gritty and in seemingly words with her brilliance is almost sacrilegious. Yet the movie was an exciting journey for movie goers alike and does allow the audience to are inside Austen world even for a brief moment that will have you wanting to never come back.",1459036800,3,578,4.411214953271028

3134261,2,B0014T7ETQ,"I love Jane Austen books and movies; was an English lit major and own nearly every version of every Jane Austen book/movie that exists -- seriously, have 3 versions of Price & Prejudice (Keira Knightley, Colin Firth & Lawrence Olivier) plus own humorous spoofs like Austenland with Kerri Russell which is a hoot. HOWEVER, this movie wasn't good. The idea is good -- most women would love to step into a Jane Austen romance so I couldn't wait to watch it, but the main character Miss Price is obnoxious, annoying and unattractive (and not very smart), and Darcy is mean-spirited and rude, not romantic or inspiring and he never gets there. It's way too modern, with people sleeping around and other inappropriate, overly sexual topics that just veer too far from what makes Jane Austen stories great. It just takes it way too far and comes out crass too many times. For Jane Austen purists who love the romance/courtly love in the stories, this one misses the boat. I will never watch it again; bought it at a guy friend's recommendation. Instead, I highly recommend Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility (especially BBC version but also Kate Winslet version), Emma, Persuasion, Austenland, Miss Austen Regrets, etc.",1449360000,,1216,4.907766990291262

3134272,2,B0014T7ETQ,"**SPOILERS** I've read many reviews on here complaining about this production because of its anachronisms or because of the poor acting or because of the many changes to the original story line: Jane with Collins, Lydia with Bingley, Caroline as a lesbian, Wickham as a good guy at heart, Charlotte in Africa, etc. - all complaints I can understand, though honestly, I could've dealt with, maybe even enjoyed. What ruined this production for me completely was the ending. Now, I don't consider myself a purist when it comes to Austen. I enjoy remakes and changes and even some sexy times when retelling Lizzy and Darcy's story, but in the end, that's what it should be: LIZZY AND DARCY'S STORY! And this is my biggest complaint, and the one I couldn't get past with this ""retelling"" of Pride & Prejudice: It's no longer Elizabeth and Fitzwilliam's story. Amanda is now the heroine, and while I understood and accepted this throughout most of the production and could even put up with Darcy TEMPORARILY falling in love with Amanda, in the end, I need Lizzy and Darcy to end up together. In that, I suppose I AM a purist. And a production or a book or any sort of media where Darcy and Lizzy don't end up together CANNOT EVER work for me.",1445904000,2,1236,4.622727272727273

Maybe Jane but if Amanda pursued Darcy Jane wouldn't be allowed to get marriage annulled. Even if she did, they had to run away to America. In all honesty, there was only a second of chemistry between Amanda and Darcy that was hardly believable. She was better suited for Wickham.

3134327,3,B0014T7ETQ,"Hugh Bonneville of Downton Abbey and Notting Hill always worth watching even the case he makes in the bonus footage for this film's highly desirable vicarious premise & potential it fails to fulfill since the writers & casting agents didn't learn from Grimm's Cinderella and Austen's Mansfield Park to successfully merge social classes by having an inherited upper class elevate someone worthy from a lower class who though lacking social standing & resources is abundant in goodness of character, and in Cinderella's case--unlike Mansfield Park or Lost in Austen--also in beauty & grace.

Yes, Hugh, we understand this film was made to bridge Britain from when it was Great down to the level it has now sunk down to today, with England's uncouth youth ignorant of her once glorious acme of polite mannered Christian society instead glorifying this film's sordid heroine's crassness & promiscuity as engaging ingenuousness & earthy frankness though this Neanderthal-jawed, straw-haired, coarse heroine is not entertaining, and Austen would be mortified and saddened by the low level King Arthur's Camelot, ""this sceptred isle, this England,"" has eroded down to today--below see level.

Ironically throughout the film the characters say it for me: Mr. Darcy speaks of the ""sewers outside polite society"" whence both this actress & her character derive, rightly calling her an ""abomination"" (Bible Book of Ezekiel adjacent to ""polluted"" & ""profane"").  The Bennett siblings complain of the over-exaggeratedly ""repugnant"" ""grisly"" ""ghastly"" Mr. Collins portrayed more like a character from Austen's Northanger Abbey than a country parsonage in Pride & Prejudice.  Even the repellent low-class heroine says Jane Austen must be atwirlin' in her grave--but not because of the heroine's repellent intrusion into the most beloved Austen classic via a shower door failing to cleanse her from polluting Austen's world and my consciousness.

Other actors & the portions of the script befitting Austen as well as the visual historical recreations are so good I viewed the film again.  US TV ""ER"" Alex Kingston is too tanned, strong & menacing for haplessly harmless Mrs. Bennett, and Mr. Darcy pales in comparison to other incarnations; but Miss Jane Bennett & Lady Catherine de Burgh are the best I've ever seen, Mr. Bingley shows more spark of life than usual (notice he looks like Barry Manilow?), and Miss Jane Bingley & Mr. Wickham are more charming than usually portrayed, which better justifies their sway over others.

The disjointed & unengaging plot is difficult to follow & aggravated by filming inconsistencies like visibly cold breath in summer attire & sets, and men in long-sleeved shirts topped by vests & wool coats with women in short-sleeved muslins without so much as a scarf or shawl draped from their elbows.  The Britishness we seek in all things Austen is excessively diluted by other nationalities as Mr. Darcy notes.  I've realized the secret to enjoying this film is to ignore the lead character & her low-life modern friends as much as possible, and employ her trick of inserting oneself into the story instead! Ahhhhhhh. Now that's more like it ;)",1423958400,2,3163,5.222879684418146

Then five minutes later he decides to marry her after all and her lack of virginity is never brought up again. The plot doesn't make sense (and there are about a million different plots, all of them nonsensical), the characters and the way they behave doesn't make sense, the acting is AWFUL, the writing for the most part makes me cringe. The main character would have been locked into an asylum in less than a week with the way she acts in this.

3134370,5,B0014T7ETQ,"Lost in Austen originally aired as a miniseries in the UK. The series heroine, Amanda Price, is a P&P obsessed 20-something who discovers Elizabeth Bennet in her bathroom getting handsy with her underthings, fresh from a portal linking her world to Amanda's modern-day London flat. You'll have to suspend disbelief as Amanda chooses to step through the door, leaving Elizabeth in 21st century London as Amanda emerges into the Bennet house to take Elizabeth's place in the story, clad in pleather leggings and a tunic top. Initially excited to find herself right at the beginning of the novel, her beloved tale quickly begins to fall apart as she realizes her presence is skewing things in ways she can't control.

This version turns a LOT of the Austen canon on it's head, which I gather upset a lot of viewers when it first aired, but for some reason I loved it. The characters are introduced exactly as you'd expect them to be and then deviate in ways that, to me, feel organic. Some of them even serve to satisfy issues readers might have with the original characters. Bingley, in this version, is forced to deal with the consequences of his weak-minded foolishness. Darcy, in turn, gets a very satisfying comeuppance for his presumptuous meddling. It's honestly the sexiest Bingley's ever been (also helped by the fact that Bingley here is played by Tom Mison, now of Sleepy Hollow and your dreams). Jane, too, gets the chance to exhibit some strength after finding little reward in the virtue of obedience when it lands her in miserable circumstances that benefit everyone but herself. The result is actually a more satisfying love story between Jane and Bingley, with both of them really having to jump some hurdles to end up together, as opposed to the tepid B-pairing they formed in Austen's original novel.

George Wickham, too, gets a refreshingly redemptive story line as a bastard with a heart of gold. The only problem is that, as a result, he comes off better than Darcy, who never deviates from the book version and suffers because of it. With all the supporting characters suddenly so vibrantly fleshed-out, choosing to maintain Darcy's aloofness renders him less a romantic hero and more of a curmudgeonly turd. Still, I've seen this movie countless times and it's always charming, funny and enjoyable, so it's definitely on my list of favorite adaptions.",1415491200,7,2373,4.915211970074813

3134410,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I had such a good time watching and laughing with this movie. It was really cute. It is about a girl named Amanda who switches places with Elizabeth Bennet. It reminded me a little of Bridgette Jones 's Diary. I think it was because of the inner dialog and the humor was really similar. Amanda carries herself as a carefree character as Bridgette did too.

I was laughing so much during this movie with the modern thought pattern trying to convert into the time period. Amanda is a huge Jane Austen fan and lives, breaths and eats P&P. Then when she finds herself with all the characters struggles to keep up with the JA dialog. One of the best parts for me was when Bingley confesses feelings for Amanda and not wanting to interfere with one of her favorite stories lies and tells Bingley she likes women. The look on his face. I lost it. There's also a scene where Darcy confesses feelings for Amanda and she asks him to do something for her. The next thing you know he's standing in a pond with his white shirt clinging to his body. We all remember that part in the 1995 P&P. Too funny.

It is well worth the time and money as it is a lighthearted romantic comedy with a surprise ending that pleased me very much. We are all this Amanda Character in the story and if you watch it in that frame of mind it is so much more enjoyable. No one is as JA wrote them but we've already read her version it's always a good time to read or see another. For those who like JA authenticity you may not like this story. There are some off colored comments but nothing too strong. I also would recommend Austenland if you enjoy this.",1407715200,4,1621,4.294117647058823

If you have ever dreamed of going back in time with Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice characters, this is the movie for you.  Usually I cannot except anyone but Colin Firth as Darcy, but Elliot Cowan won me over.

It's the part were Amanda trys to play the piano after dinner for Mr. Darcy, Bingley and his sister. She doesn't know how to play the piano and ends up singning ""Downtown"" by Petula Clark.

3134463,1,B0014T7ETQ,"The only reason I can come up with for this ridiculous movie being made, is that the writers hate Pride & Prejudice and wanted to ruin every character in it. Well they did.

****SPOILERS****

-Elizabeth walks away from her family and doesn't care to show up when Jane gets married, and even at the fact of her father near death she cares more about turning off appliances.
-Jane marries Mr. Collins.
-Charlotte goes to Africa alone as a missionary.
-Mr. Bingley is distraught at Jane getting married so he becomes a drunk, runs off with Kitty, and almost kills Mr. Bennett.
-Caroline is gay.
-Georgiana is a liar who threw herself at Wickham, and was rejected.
-Mr. Wickham is a good guy.
**-And finally, the worst of them all was Mr. Darcy. He is NOTHING like Austen's Mr. Darcy, and if he was, he wouldn't have fallen for someone like Amanda (main character). She is crude and ridiculous. For claiming to love the world presented in P&P, along with knowing the book line by line, she doesn't even try to fit in. And when she does finally try, she is still horrible at it. There was nothing funny or likable about her to me.

I like how the story makes Darcy Amanda's. Lost In Austen is very sweet and well written.

So her witty banter invariably includes a few modern English swear words; when walking in a beautiful gown, she not only fails to float but plods around more like a plow horse.  Meanwhile, she's enamored and frustrated with the time period and people's pride and prejudices.  Absolutely loved this movie, however, before you watch it, you MUST either watch the Hollywood 2 hr. pride and prejudice or better yet the 10 hr.

The writer was able to create a hilarious mix stirring together archaic British grammar and contemporary slang.

The gemische is spiced up with symbolism, twisted plot lines, and unexpected character developments eg perversions in Zeal of the Lord Collins, the generous honorable side of womanizer Wickham, sneaky 15 year old Georgiana, the perceptive Lady Catherine de Bourgh. And new characters born of Elizabeth's comment ""I may be fortunate enough to meet another Mr Collins!""

Familiar speeches from Austen books and movies weave sparkles into the appreciation for this farce.

Some viewers could not believe that Amanda Price could be an Austen fan and yet not fit into the Georgian period more smoothly. I enjoy reading Asian novels, however the reality of living in ryokan finds my tatami cluttered with suitcases, clothes, toiletry paraphernalia, my voice unacceptably loud, grammar not predictably gracious enough, clothes not appropriately combined and draped, my legs too stiff for sitting without central heat or central plumbing. It takes a while to fit in, and adapt to the lack of toileting and bathing facilities, the bias against women speaking, and unfamiliarity of finding oneself in another culture. Amanda Price took a while to find her feet in Georgian England as well given her upbringing in Hammersmith, a formerly industrial region, and her spunk.

5 star enjoyable romp. I compiled the following list to help with comprehension.

3134509,1,B0014T7ETQ,"No really, I don't. I completely fail to understand how this managed to get a 4-star rating. It wasn't funny. It wasn't witty. It wasn't even written or performed particularly well. The premise had promise, but I just can't seem to wrap my head around where it went from there. In all honesty, it came off like bad fan fiction. *Really* bad fan fiction. It's not like I went into this expecting to watch another version of ""Pride and Prejudice;"" I expected things to get mixed up and crazy, for Amanda to be a total fish out of water and for hilarity to ensue. I suppose I can even understand her completely mucking the 19th century manners up ... or at least I could have if she hadn't claimed to have had most of the book memorized. If you've really read a book that many times, you'd at least have some vague idea of how to comport yourself in the world of said book, right? I mean, unless you're a total idiot... like Amanda. The girl didn't even try. Anyway, it was a mess. The ""heroine"" has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and neither does her supposed love interest. The only bit of charm in this whole debacle was a few of Elizabeth's scenes in modern times; she managed her time-swap much better than Amanda, and frankly I'd rather have watched a show about Elizabeth Bennet making her way as a nanny in modern London than what I actually sat through.",1383609600,15,1363,4.456

3134527,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I rarely review what so many others have, but ""Lost in Austen"" has to be an exception.  Not realizing it had begun as a television series,  I was surprised how long the DVD played, but I was mesmerized until far into the night.  Others have commented on the superb casting and fast-moving pace.  This is not just another chick flick!

The idea of some kind of portal inside a home, leading to another world, is not a new theme.  The young people's ""Twitches"" films, earlier though far less significant,  used the portal theme to good effect.  Finding a secret door leading to another reality is the fantasy of many children, though most surely don't expect to look for it in a bathroom!

Neither is the concept of jumping into a book unique, not so much the fantasy of children, but of avid-reading adults.  Jasper Fforde has a well-written, entertaining novel series beginning with ""The Eyre Affair,""  based on a British government literary detective who jumps in and out of a variety of classic novels, occasionally including those of Austen.  While we get a brief glimpse of classic novel settings and wonderful characters in these literary excursions, the main focus remains Fforde's protagonist and her goal of solving a mystery or bringing back her ""eradicated"" husband. In ""Lost in Austen,"" the classic novel is the central reality.

The magic of ""Lost in Austen"" is ""Pride and Prejudice"" itself, and the desire so many of us have to experience more of it, lamenting that Austen's life was rather brief, only enough time to create a handful of superb novels.  Protagonist Amanda is perfectly representative of those of us who have read and reread, watched and re-watched all that has been published or presented, thirsting for more.  THIS IS MORE!

There is a certain frustration for those of us who are sure the plot of Austen cannot be altered.  Amanda herself suffers just such emotion, creating a tension that is both upsetting and intriguing, as she tries to force each character to do the right thing.  How could we as viewers not expect that when a writer inserts a modern character into an antique setting (as in ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"") the potential is created for something original, quite different than Austen herself envisioned?  Because it is Jane Austen's enduring masterpiece, we all know what characters are like, who marries whom, and how it ends...Or do we?

I particularly liked the portrayals of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett, Jane, Elizabeth, D'Arcy and his sister, reveled in the twists of character and plot that were contrived but consistent with the facts presented in the book.  This is the best Lady Catherine of the four movie versions of this story that I've seen, with an intensity that shines from the screen.  A very fine addition to the venerable works of Jane Austen that should be enjoyable for a wide audience.  The main character Amanda Price grates on you at first, but warms up if you watch the movie more than once.

If that's true, she appeared dreadfully uninformed about how to behave after entering the 19th century. Her constant fumbling and screwing things up was beyond ridiculous, and her crass crudity was just wrong. She was a stupid and witless character with a bucket-mouth. Her crudity and stupidity was no doubt gratuitously done, given modern audiences and films, but to do this with Pride and Prejudice? It isn't even worthy of being called a joke, much less a fantasy.

3134561,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I'm a dyed in the wool, bonafide Jane Austen fan and don't typically enjoy contemporary spins on the classics. BUT THIS MOVIE is as genuine to the Austen spirit (as can be expected if a woman from the 21st Century were truly portaged back in time) and found herself amidst the more genteel customs and lack of modern convenience.

Jemima Rooper plays it believably and all I can say is I hope the writers, producers & players are willing to go the distance and bring all the other titles to life! Alex Kingston does a marvelous portrayal of Mrs Bennet and the writers give an insight and depth to her dire position of mother to five girls that allows for her overwhelming emotionalism. Don't get me wrong, she's a basket-case but we've all known a few of those and obviously so did Miss Austen! Hugh Bonneville's character, Mr Bennet, is even more delightful and witty but the biggest surprise in madcap is Wickham! Here we find a plausible extension to his fiber (both moral and/or otherwise) that rounds out his personality. I found it hard to believe that a young man so evil could have gained the trust of old Mr Darcy (being that readers are led to believe that he is so discerning) and wise a judge of character.

Contemporary viewers may think of Regecy life as a slower pace but Jane Austen moves plots along like a freight train and this movie keeps up the pace. All in all- a delightful romp that I love to surprise and share with my friends who need a good diversion from our reality and technology.",1367712000,,1510,4.507299270072993

The cast of characters are BRITISH PERFECT, when it comes to producing something equivalent to Downton Abbey, but here, they are all inversted into to Austin's greatest work. Reading Pride and Prejudice beforehand is an absolute necessity, as the dialogue is extracted, twisted and repackaged in this funny and beautifully realistic depiction of Austen's novel of early 19th century English gentry.  OK, you can get away with NOT READING, but to see how the script writers have cleverly reshaped the characters and even extracted dialogue from Austen's other works is truly an added delight.  Amanda Price is our 21st century ""Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.""  She is also independent, very sharp (like Elizabeth Bennett) and comes into the story at the very beginning. Her opportunity to be IN her favorite novel early on in the plot is so much the adventure of a lifetime.  Little does she realize the equally frightening potential to screw everything up!

So when I saw Lost in Austen on Netflix a few years ago I was completely skeptical and a little afraid of what I was about to watch.  Turns out my fear was for nothing!  What a little gem of a movie this was and I enjoyed it so much I watched it a few more times before I canceled my Netflix subscription.  So of course when I saw it for sale here on Amazon I had to get it!

I'm sure there are plenty of synopis's here in the review section so I won't bore anyone with another, suffice to say all of the main characters were a joy to watch and while the focus is on Amanda Price and Mr. Darcy (both exceptional, I really enjoyed them together), I was most drawn to Jane and Mr. Bingley.  The pain, torture and longing between the two was played by way of both actors that you really felt the emotions.  I feel its always a sign of a great movie or book when you can really ""feel"" what the characters are feeling.

It was a disappointment. SPOILERS below.

I didn't like how the movie played out. It sends out the wrong message: If you hate your real life love life--maybe a magic door will appear and you'll nab the fictional man of your dreams while ruining everyone else's life in the process. Forget about your real life and just abandon that guy who wants to marry you in the real world!

I didn't find the Amanda Price character to be likeable at all. I can understand how her presence can alter events but it didn't explain why all the characters were making out-of-character choices. I don't understand what was so appealing about her and why every character was falling in love with her.

Lastly, If you love the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth, then don't watch this movie. It's nonexistent here.

The only thing I liked about this movie and why I gave it 1 star was Tom Mison as Charles Bingley. Adorable. :)",1362096000,11,1060,4.647058823529412

THE GOOD

1. The casting is excellent.
Jemima Rooper and Elliot Cowan bring serious sizzle to their roles of Amanda Price and Mr. Darcy, respectively. I love spunky, emotional Amanda, who tries her best to stay close to the premise of P&P, but mucks up everything. At first, I didn't warm to Cowan (too much squinting and glowering I felt at first) but the repressed passion and UST he delivers is ridiculously off the charts. Consider the scene where he tells Amanda she repels him. On one level, everything he says is correct, but on another, she clearly affects him in a way he finds most uncomfortable and that feeling repels him even as it attracts him to her (parsonage scene). Lovely bit of acting in both parts. The wet shirt scene is drool, freeze-frame worthy, I mean seriously, the man is gorgeous!!!! Alex Kingston shines as the motherly but ditzy Mrs. Bennet, while the others bring alive what I've always considered to be two-dimensional characters, in particular Morven Christie (Jane Bennet) andTom Mison as Mr. Bingley (more on them below)

2. Plot twists are unconventional, but work (for the most part)
The Jane and Charles twist was excellent! I've always thought of Jane and Bingley in the original P&P as plot devices rather than fully fleshed out characters. Here, it's a delight to see two essentially weak people having to come to terms with hard life choices. Excellent acting, so much so, it almost stole the screen time of the two main characters, Amanda and Darcy. The Wickham/Georgiana reveal was nicely played as well. Again Wickham/Georgiana more of a plot device in the original text, but here there are many shades of grey. Love it!

3. The little LOLs count
Amanda furiously brushing her teeth on her return to her time. That's exactly what I would've done. Mrs. Bennet sinking into a deep curtsy for Mr. Darcy at Pemberly, so deep it was as if she was greeting royalty. Mr. Bennet examining what looked suspiciously like a marijuana leaf. Amanda singing Downtown and Darcy's smirk of reluctant appreciation; Amanda's post-modern moment :) I know and concur!

There's much more I can say, but I have to get to...

THE NOT SO GOOD

1. The ending.
While I wanted Amanda to have her happy moment and the love of her life, I mean it's canon. Darcy and Elizabeth belong together, fullstop the end. It was a risky ploy having her end up with Darcy, and I actually would have preferred her to love and lose Darcy (in that time I mean) and have her go back to her time and meet her own Darcy (a descendant of the original delicious Darcy).

2. Mr. Bennet
The actor was fine, but the character was written as a little too easygoing. He just trusts Amanda because Lizzy says so? No concern over his favourite daughter going off apparently in the middle of the night to Hammersmith? Brushing off Mrs. Bennet actual legitimate concerns? Nah.

3. Caroline's reveal
Well played by the actresses, but a little too soapy for me. No thanks.

4. The pacing between Amanda and Darcy
He hated her, apologised for being wrong, confessed his love rather quickly after that, and then withdrew it after finding out Amanda wasn't a virgin, proposed to Caroline, followed Amanda to the future, said he loved her again, then decided to try with Lizzy, then back to Amanda. Phew, it was too much back and forward and I blame the writers here. Overly complicating things just made it more difficult to understand exactly how, why and when he had fallen in love with her, even to follow her to another time.

5. The comment about negroes on the bus. That was just really awkward. We know he was from a different time but there were many other ways that could have been shown.

All in all, it's worth it to watch it over and over again, as I have, and it's a good show, just not worth 5 stars.",1360627200,2,3990,4.61212976022567

Since it was a mini-series, it is several hours long, but it is enjoyable. If you like Austen adaptations like Bridget Jones or Austenland, British actors, and yummy Elliot Cowan, you might like it.

If you are willing to see this film as a fun take on the original novel and not be one of those stick in the muds who get all hot and bothered that someone played with the idea of Darcy and Elisabeth then this is worth watching.

3134599,3,B0014T7ETQ,"I usually don't appreciate Jane Austen fan fictions, but I will make a guarded exception for this movie. The whole plot of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has been changed here, but I thought the reasons for the changes have some merrit, and so I found myself willing to TEMPORARILY suspend my love of this classic book and entertain an alternate reality for the Bennett Family. THIS IS NOT ""PRIDE AND PREJUDICE"", but a commentary on how sometimes ""the grass is greener on the other side of the fence"". The foundational point of this storyline is simple and well taken, the story is interesting and tolerably well acted, I rooted for the characters, and found the ending to be satisfactory for this ""alternate reality"" tale.

The writer(s) of LOST IN AUSTEN are not trying to do a modernized remake of Jane Austen's beloved story, but are instead, pointing out the irony of how multitudes of modern women are in love with Austen's period tales of romance, when Jane herself, hated the suffocating constraints that were placed upon women in the society of her day. These very novels that have captivated women of today were actually a scream of frustration from a woman who would have dearly loved to find a door to the freedom that comes along with living in our modern times. In her novels, Jane Austen was able to become mistress of the fortunes of her heroines, but Austen's personal stark reality was that she was stuck in a cultural trap from which she never escaped. Some of today's women may well wish they could escape the harsh realities of our life and times, but the Regency era was rife with problems of it's own and freedom was reserved for only a privledged few women who were lucky enough to ""catch the right husband"". It could be argued that the fantasy world of Jane-mania is foolish, and that most of us wouldn't like it if we could actually go to Jane's world and cope with the situations we would find ourselves in.

To make it tolerable for Amanda Price, a few unrealistic concessions to the ""Modern"" outlook had to be incorporated into the story. I will not spoil it by telling what these concessions are, but will only warn you that if you watch this movie hoping for another remake of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, you will be sorely disappointed - just be prepared to enter into a story where everything is changed from the novel that you love. This was very thought provoking to me and I think it reminds us that we don't know what we are craving when we wish for a different reality than has been given us.

BOTTOM LINE????  I love Jane Austen stories and have read/watched each one many times over.  Just like Amanda Price, they are always new to me.  These stories never get old and I am sure that there will always be days when nothing but a ""True Jane"" will do.  While LOST IN AUSTEN is very watchable and I liked it for a one time fling, it will never be in the same class as a real Jane Austen.  Once was enough, and I doubt if I will ever watch it again.  The true test of a really REALLY great story is when you still love it after years and years of re-reads.  I cannot say that about LOST IN AUSTEN, or about any other Jane Austen fan fiction I have ever encountered.  There is simply nothing like a ""True Jane"".",1356220800,,3228,4.454237288135594

Mr and Mrs Bennett are played as well as they were in the supreme 1980 version; here they are not clownish, yet still funny.  A very good balance of the real and the fantasy story. I think a viewer MUST be pretty familiar with the printed novel and at least one of the previous films, to get the best out of this.  It is long --- three hours? --- and the very end seems a little drawn out, but I was enchanted all the way through. Jemima Rooper pulls off the difficult task of fitting in to the early 1800's without either clashing or making fun of it; a very believable performance.  A lot of time and money and preparation must have gone into this excellent production.  You will not be disappointed --- but make sure you are familiar with the story first!",1355270400,,844,4.24375

3134611,1,B0014T7ETQ,"I am all astonishment at the positive reviews of this dreadful mess. The plot has been described, so I will only say I was intrigued by the idea and went in with a positive attitude. Alas, hope died quickly. I could go with Amanda and Lizzie switching places via some rip in the fabric of time located in Amanda's bathroom wall, although it's not one of the more elegant time travel scenarios.  But would the Bennetts have demonstrated such a complete lack of concern upon discovering that Lizzie had run off to stay at the home of people who were complete strangers to them?  NO. They would have been horrified! Did she have a suitable chaperone? Were her hosts respectable? But they just accept it and welcome into their lives Lizzie's oddly-dressed new friend, Amanda. Being a huge fan of the manners of Austen's time, Amanda naturally tries to fit in by smoking, getting drunk, and lunging at Bingley to kiss him - with tongue. Yes, this is SO Austen-esque.  Later, for reasons too ridiculous to explain, she tells Bingley she's a lesbian. Then she becomes engaged to Mr. Collins. Help us all.  Then Collins breaks it off with HER  (reflect on that for a minute - I mean how big of a loser would you have to be to get Mr. Collins to dump you?) at the Netherfield ball, after hearing a rumor that she is the daughter of a fishmonger. Amanda responds to his rejection by kneeing him in the crotch, which gets her kicked out of the ball in disgrace by Mr. Darcy. If any of this somehow sounds like it might be funny, I must disillusion you. It's all squirmingly uncomfortable and idiotic. I threw in the towel when Darcy declared his mad love for Amanda. This was a howler, as it made no sense even in the context of this stupid movie. Just a few scenes earlier, he told her she was ""an abomination"" - ouch! - but then, with hardly any additional interaction between them, he is supposed to be so besotted that he overlooks the minor quibbles that she is the  hard-drinking, bi-sexual daughter of a fishmonger.

None of the characters seemed charming or to have that spark of life to them that makes us enjoy all the characters of Pride and Prejudice even while knowing all of their faults. Besides, if at the end of the movie you like Wickham more then Mr. Darcy...something is deeply wrong. Seriously, I questioned my nature as a female when I had this epiphany. Amanda is...I don't know, a bit clumsy and bland; and I think I have enough respect for us women that most of us who have read Pride and Prejudice would have done better then her in this situation.

Character isn't remotely convincing as someone who has read P&P but perhaps merely watched movie versions.  The only bright woman in this story is the one who wisely escapes most of it.  Messed up on some of the details of the period which would have helped to make it believable but perhaps only Austen fans will notice. Don't expect Austen style wit and subtlety--this is like a period situation comedy. Three stars is a fair rating for this.",1347148800,,756,4.7846153846153845
3134619,2,B0014T7ETQ,"Let me start off by saying I've never read Pride and Prejudice, nor really any literature written around this time. A travesty, I know, but the point is that the only exposure I've had to this world is one of the movie adaptions. I loved it, and so when I heard that there was a miniseries out about a modern girl switching places with Elizabeth, I was really excited to watch it. Obviously with a plot like this, things were not going to go the way of Austen's novel at all, but I was okay with that and prepared for it.

Now, I'm not a purist of any fandom. I like different adaptions, theories behind a characters ""real"" motives, whatever (heck, bring on the fanfiction even). So I'll say that I'm okay with changing things--to a point. What Lost in Austen did to the characters in this world is just reprehensible. I understand that the world had to be expanded and different scenes would occur because of the main character, Amanda's, presence, but some of it was just so entirely unbelievable that I found myself actually getting angry. Some of these characters--which, I admit, I myself don't know very well--just seemed to be so far off from what I remembered them being, and even what they started off as in the beginning of the series!

I think my biggest problem by far was the main character. I could not relate to her in ANY way other than the fact that I, too, would love to be transported into the world of my favorite book. She was rude, crass, refused for the longest time to try to fit in to the world around her, and bumbled around throughout the course of the series making everything and everyone around her infinitely more miserable. I know why she loved Darcy--she'd already decided she loved him from the start, despite hours of complaining about how awful he was--but I have absolutely NO idea why Darcy loved her. It honestly seemed to come out of nowhere and felt really forced.

Mr. Darcy was horribly cruel and stubborn, Amanda was vulgar and intent on doing the exact opposite of what was considered ""proper"", Bingley was pathetic, and every other character just completely unrecognizable after awhile. Amanda literally made everyone's life worse until--magically--everything was fixed right at the end to give that happy ending. The show was painful, uncomfortable, and tiresome. I gave it two stars because there were a few redeeming scenes and laughs, and the acting was actually fairly good. It was a really intriguing, wonderful idea, but the execution was just awful. Perhaps this is a bit harsh, but I was so excited to watch this and ended up only being frustrated and bitterly disappointed.",1347062400,8,2629,4.698481561822126

The premise is weird, it follows Amanda Price a sweet modern woman who loves ""Pride and Prejudice"". Then one day in her bathroom she discovers Elizabeth Bennet. At first Amanda thinks it's a dream, but soon Elizabeth shows Amanda a door in her bathroom that leads to that other world set 200 years ago.

Amanda steps inside, directly into the hall of the Bennet house, when suddenly the door connecting the two worlds closes shut. So she is stuck in the world of Elizabeth Bennet.

What I liked about this series are the unexpected twists. I liked how all the characters grew throughout the story. I really liked Mr. Wickham in this version. I loved Mr Darcy as he grew throughout the series, he was also the handsomest Darcy I have seen yet. I liked how most of the characters got their HEA by learning to follow their heart, and to shed unfair prejudices and rules. I was glad that Amanda Price got her happy ending too, I was rooting for her. Last but not least, I enjoyed the comedic approach.

The one drawback is that the ending felt rushed. They should have added a scene with a montage showing snippets of everyone's life, after they ended up with who they wanted. I also wished they had given Mr. Wickham a love interest.

This girl, Amanda Price, gets thrown back in time to this story and ends up messing everything up. Instead of Charlotte ending up with Collins, she goes to Africa and Mr. Bingley at first ends up falling for her instead of Jane! Much hilarity ensues when she wildly professes she can't be with him because she likes girls, after being backed into a corner by him. The plot has many twists and turns and is quite believable as to what might actually happen if someone from this time got plopped into the middle of a Jane Austen book. It was delightful and funny and I highly recommend it, especially if you've seen one too many bad movie renditions of Pride and Prejudice.

One of my worst remembrances of college English, in fact, was being forced to write an essay, through gritted teeth, on Pride and Prejudice.  However, I have to say that Austen's stories make very good movies or, as in this instance, tv series.  The producers have managed to remain true to the spirit of Austen's story while adding the novel twist of a modern London girl being transported back to Austen's era. Wisely the story does not dwell on the time travel aspect,and does not become a science fiction tale.  There is just a simple door in a bathroom wall through which the modern heroine goes back in time while Elizabeth Bennett enters contemporary England. It then closes, locks and plays very little role thereafter.  Virtually all of the story takes place in the earlier era with only a small segment where the heroine and some of the Austen characters end up in contemporary London. Probably the most surprising aspect of this story is that it is exceedingly funny and I for one don't laugh easily. Very few things make me laugh out loud but this story often had me laughing to the point of tears. Because this is based on tv series I had expected to watch this over a number of days, Instead my family and I sat and watched it from start to finish, all three hours in one sitting.

After watching it several times, my admiration has grown exponentially.  The dialogue is marvelous, the language sublime- that's what's most noteworthy, in my estimation.  I loved the language so much I watched it one time through with English captions on, so I wouldn't miss a syllable.

The characters are fully fleshed out [with one exception, below], their actions in keeping with the original, yet they grow, develop, partly as a result of their contact with 21st century Miss Price, partly as a result of the absence of Lizzie.  We come to know them much better.  They're funny, wry, clever- all perfectly in character- phenomenal.

ALL the actors are wonderful.  I especially liked the characterizations of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Wickham, & Mr. Bingley- their development, the greater understanding we gain of them.  For me, this definitely rounds out, deepens, the P&P experience.

Only a few small quibbles do I have (SPOILER ALERT- DON'T READ AHEAD IF YOU WANT TO BE SURPRISED).  I'm no prude (for example, thought the ""landing patch"" bit funny), but I thought the sniffing fingers business was gross, repulsive- moreover, a distraction, because in every subsequent scene with Mr. Collins you're waiting to see if he does it or not, rather than attending to the dialogue and his wonderful acting.  Annoying.

Secondly, although the story is jam-packed, Darcy doesn't have enough to do, as compared to the original.  He mostly just looks stern and dubious, one eyebrow arched.  We don't see much of an evolution over time, as we did with Colin Firth's Darcy- wrestling with his emotions, taking action to correct things, etc.  [Granted, many of Firth's actions occurred off-camera, but we learn of them- in subsequent viewings we know what he's up to, been up to.  This Darcy does a lot less in front of the camera, AND behind the scenes.]  His softening/metamorphosis comes almost entirely at the end, with little precedent (or build-up of dramatic tension, I thought).

There could've been dynamite scenes in which Darcy learns the truth about Wickham, or, spearheads the effort to rescue Lydia, or, orchestrates the Collins's anullment.  The script neglects him, or renders him incidental in many scenes (perhaps some scenes ended up on the cutting-room floor).  The focus was on Miss Price, and I think the plot would've been better served, the end even more satisfying had Darcy played a more active role throughout, would have provided greater justification for her falling head over heels in love with him.  Indeed, Mr. Wickham's character was much better developed, it wouldn't have surprised me if she'd fallen for him.

I have other small gripes, such as the fact that she's a smoker, has only one cigarette left, takes one puff and then tosses it away (would never happen), and noted several missteps in the plot (they could've expanded on Darcy's experience in modern day London, for example, or could've had Mr. Bingley and Lydia go off in search of Utopia instead of for an apparent tryst), but oh well.  The missing Downtown scene, though brief, was endearing and humanizing, softened her brashness, too bad it was left out.

But, these are relatively minor gripes.  The music was great, the lighting and sets gorgeous, the acting uniformly superb.  And kudos to the lead actress- she got it just right- perfectly natural, never a false note, at first like a bull in a china-shop, but gradually becoming more at home in her surroundings, more attuned to others (and 18th century sensibilities), more in love, more luminous.

Well-done, a keeper!",1331510400,2,3874,4.95046439628483

This could have been a good movie if Amanda spent her time trying to get the book back on track rather than falling in love with Darcy herself.  I think it's ridiculous that every man that comes into contact with Amanda instantly falls under her spell even though she's everything men of that period would dislike and disapprove of.  I thought Mr. Darcy of all men would have better sense. I believe in creativity, but I also believe in characters remaining true to their original character, and the characters in this movie do not.  I did not cheer when Lizzie stayed in the future, and Amanda stayed with Darcy.  It was a big disappointment.

3134644,5,B0014T7ETQ,"You can't take this movie too seriously, especially if you take P&P seriously. Having said that this movie does not trash or disrespect P&P in any way. The central theme of the movie is preserving something that has already been errecably changed, and imagining hiden depths to all the characters, which doesn;t at all slight JA in her own characterisation, but makes the watcher realize that everyone that Miss Austen created can be looked at a little differntly.

The basic premis has been discussed, and having seen clips focusing on the potential of a romance between Amanda the heroine and Darcy, I was of course skeptical that I would like this movie. First the only way that a romance could work is if the romance that we all love, Elizabeth and Darcy is destroyed, second I don't really want to spend three hours getting involved with a love story just to see it fall apart, so it's no win, they get together and you've just ruined one couple, they stay apart and you've just waisted your time. I spend most of the begining of the movie worrying about this, until I realized that without the romance the movie was fun and thoughtful. I got to see the train of events we all know get derailed, and watch Amanda try to put them together.

I won't give the ending away, but I will say it was satisfying. This movie is really something that all P&P fans can appreciate, I doubt if non P&P fans will find as much funny about this movie, nor will they appreciate the charcter shifts. My favorite scene in the movie is when the Benetts are rescued by non other than George Wickham, and the dashing charming Captian is set down right away by Amanda who isn;t going to have any of his charm.

Yes, I know it had swearing, smoking and some other things like that, but It's not meant to be a a classic and classy Jane Austen story because it's a MODERN Jane Austen comedy and SUPPOSED to be set in today's world mixed in with the Jane Austen era. Of course it's going to be crazy and the casting not all that fantastic. They deliberately intended with this as it's not meant to be a 'serious' drama, so of course the actors will be made to act not as professionally as they usually would.

I thought it was funny, romantic and very well made. 'Amanda' is not exactly your standard Jane Austen film 'pretty girl' with manners, she is an ordinary girl who swears and seems a bit of a dreamer which made it more likable as she was realistic, and not this gorgeous and perfect girl. It was hilarious seeing the reactions of her going into the 'Jane Austen' world with her modern clothes, modern language and appearance!

I also liked how the other characters looked more as they would've looked back in Jane Austen's time, not just with clothing, but in appearance as they looked quite 'natural' and not with so much make-up on as other films. In other Jane Austen films, the girls are always stunningly beautiful girls, nice to see a difference in this film, same with the men.",1322956800,3,1384,4.377431906614786

I am, however, inordinately diverted by the antic caperings of the haters. After you've read a couple, you can almost recite the next one on autopilot. Miss Price being repeatedly slated as being vulgar is particularly mystifying. She was just normal. Anyone would think a chavvy ladette had rushed the stage clutching a half-empty bottle of cider...

I also have a particularly soft spot for those who miss the point completely. Bless.

This was an excellent, witty take on P & P. All the right elements were there, and all the right references even to the Firth / Ehle BBC version (a rival network, at that). The music was spot on. Also, if you are a Brit, there was the extra amazement factor of ITV, of all things uncorking something with anything resembling class. A rare thing indeed.

The acting was all top drawer with everyone stealing scenes all over the place. Hugh Bonneville was especially larcenous.

The scripting and delivery of the language also worked well. Everyone has seen the BBC one and you could feel instantly at ease with the rhythm and vocabulary. It worked because it was instantly understandable, and you felt it was authentic. (Well BBC authentic... That's all that matters.) If they had fouled the script up, then the whole thing would have just collapsed in a heap.

I can do no more than recommend this unreservedly. If you do end up hating it, you were probably predisposed to doing so, in which case why did you bother? If you objected to them playing ducks and drakes with the plot, I think you were probably aiming to buy the real thing, and picked up the wrong DVD box.",1319414400,9,1807,4.596273291925466

It is hilarious! As mentioned by other reviewers, the end does sort of fizzle out in a lame way, but in general I was surprisingly satisfied with the tone of the movie. I didn't find it at all disrespectful to the original literature, it's just innocent speculation on whether or not finding yourself in your ideal fantasy world would indeed be ideal. I would definitely recommend it, though I must say that you probably won't fully appreciate the jokes and characters if you're not really familiar with the novel.

A modern day girl sent through time...but sent inside of a novel! What I enjoyed most was the continuous unexpected moments and humor. See what would happen if the characters switched partners, or someones real character were made known! Some areas that weren't in the book are in here. Some areas from the book are in here.

However, when she actually was given the chance to enter that world, she repeatedly showed herself to be unworthy of it.  She is crude, she gets drunk at a party, and she teaches Lydia bad things.  She had once professed to know and love the world of the Austens, but when she doesn't get her way in the matter of marriage she presumes to lecture a heartbroken Darcy about the lack of ""emotional integrity"" she sees in the Regency culture.  Very offensive.  Clearly she doesn't belong in his world.  She should have gone back where she came from once she had brought Lizzie back to her rightful time.",1316304000,,881,4.560509554140127

3134656,4,B0014T7ETQ,"I had read the negative reviews of this movie and watched it seeking out things that would irritate me. Did I find them? Yes, but I feel they were inconsequential as I was caught up in the story right from the start and ended up liking the movie! It seems those who hated this movie just didn't get it. It's not purported to be an adaptation of P and P, it's the story of Amanda's fantasy of being plunged into the book and the plot twists and characterizations are all her doing. Contrary to what some thought, it seemed to me that Amanda did a good job adapting to her environment. Sure she reverted to 21st century expression at times, but think about it: She lived 20-some years in the modern world and like 5 minutes in the 19th century. Who could possibly achieve a complete character overhaul instantly? As for the twisting of the original story of Pride and Prejudice, I found it intriguing. Why not take all of those characters and say, What If? How might they have behaved under different circumstances? Again, while you may not agree with the directions they went, this is how Amanda crafted it in her fantasy world. Personally I thought the snobby haughty rude character being outed as a closet lesbian was hilarious. One thing that did bug me was the absence of Bingley's other sister and her husband. I know they were not critical to the storyline, but considering that Amanda claims to have read the book over and over till it was almost a part of her, you would think there would be at least a mention of 2 characters who were present in many scenes of the original book. All in all, I think the folks who hated this movie have got some prejudice of their own to examine. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The reason it only deserves 4 stars is that it's a bit long to sit through and because there are little annoyances throughout, but overall it's good entertainment.

3134657,3,B0014T7ETQ,"The premise of this was a fun one.  Too bad they pretty much screwed it up.  First off it was extremely difficult to have an empathy for the lead actress and her character.  As other reviewers said, if she liked the era so much in the book why didn't she try to adapt more. And personally I found her uninteresting and crude.  I couldn't believe she was really an Austen fan.  The rest of the plots were either silly or made no sense.  Yes she would have some affect on the characters but I found it very hard to believe they would accept her and her appearance so easily.  The other actors/actresses were okay, even though their characters' personalties were changed from the book.  I'm not going into plot details, you can read othe reviews that have done good jobs of that.

All that said, the only good thing about this mess was Elliot Cowan as Darcy.  He had the perfect arrogant good looks and that passion just beneath the surface.  And he's a hunk.  His personal emotional versus rational inner fight was portrayed perfectly.  So many of the Darcy actors either over-do one or the other.  I gave it 3 stars for the attempt and for Cowan.

 I watched it and copied it on cable.  But I pretty much only watch the last half over again.  I would never buy it.",1315699200,6,1263,4.370689655172414
3134658,2,B0014T7ETQ,"Well.  It has been said, but I will agree with the other haters: poor execution of a good idea.  The fatal flaw is, sadly, the main character.  I have nothing against the actress, but the character is totally unlike-able, uncouth, dirty-mouthed, and stupid. The accent alone would probably get her shunned in Austen society, let alone the AWFUL HAIR that I wanted to fix the entire series.  She also wanders around without a bonnet throughout - totally unacceptable, and as others noted, kind of odd for a supposed Austen devotee. (and I guess she packed a flat-iron). I suppose the idea was that someone casually tuning in, with no particular knowledge of Austen, can see that she ""doesn't belong"".  Well that kind of visual cue is unnecessary for probably 90% of the audience and does irreparable damage to the whole premise, if we are actually to believe that a modern person is inhabiting a lifelike version of Regency England.

I did like some character alterations (Wickham's character), although some (like toning down Mrs Bennet's neuroticism) seem possibly due to just being lazy/not understanding the original.

Outside of the main character, I thought all the characters were exceptionally well-cast.  To bad it was wasted on the poor script.

Oh, and the ending was execrable.  I can see why Elizabeth wants to stay in the 2000s, but I can't see either the attraction of Darcy or his for Amanda, and it reveals that this movie (as probably should not have been in doubt) is about as intelligent as your average chick-flick providing wish-fulfilment for the masses.",1314489600,6,1576,4.9356060606060606

3134669,1,B0014T7ETQ,"I read all the glowing reviews and looked forward to this DVD.  I was never so disappointed. The girl, Amanda, is dropped into the late 1700's in leggings & Black leather jacket with a modern hairdo, and no one notices. Her presence changes everything about the story.  Amanda doesn't even try to act like she belongs in that time.
I thought she would get everything back on track before she went back to her time, but no.
Spoiler Alert.
Wickham is a good guy!
Jane marries Mr. Collins!!!!!
Bingly runs off with Lydia!!!!
Elizabeth stays in the future!!!!
And Amanda stays with Darcy!!!!!!!
The only thing that is corrected is Jane and Mr. Collins never consumate the marriage so she gets out of it, and is able to marry Bingly (who didn't seduce Lydia).

This dvd did a good job of answering that I liked that both women switched places so the viewer could see both scenarios and how each fit.  I wish they would have focused a bit more on what Lizzie did in the real, current time.
I liked how they made the viewer think about how there could be more to scandal or event (Mr. Whickam and Darcy's sister) then what was told.
The only thing I could have done without was the language was a bit much in certain areas and I wish they would tone that down. I wish the main character would have gotten into the time period and at least in one scene put her hair up but besides thatI felt it was very well done.",1303344000,,945,4.026595744680851

3134674,5,B0014T7ETQ,"THANK YOU!

I am totally grateful to be absolutely FREE of any and all tendency to compare this movie with the original novel and be disappointed as a result. The original Austen novel serves as fodder.

Think of it this way: Amanda is thrust ""back in time"" to a FICTIONAL WORLD: in other words, a world that simply never existed except in her own mind! What makes the movie so enjoyable is that it is truly Amanda's story and not some crappy thing being shoehorned into Austen's original work. The revelations are about Amanda, how she thinks, how she reacts, how she adapts. It is not about Pride and Prejudice any more. Suspend your disbelief and be Amanda for a short while.

As for wishing you could see Amanda bumbling around in a story that more closely resembled Pride and Prejudice, gosh, I would not wish that on the most forgiving of Austen fans. It is much more fun to watch Amanda struggle in a ""fictional reality"" that does not at all resemble her expectations.

Austen makes Henry Tilney say in Northanger Abbey that a novel is ""only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the best-chosen language."" For Austen, that meant one thing. For this movie, it means something entirely different, and as far as I am concerned, they succeeded quite well in that quality that matters most in a movie: it entertained me.

Yes. I expected to dislike the movie. But I liked it quite a lot.",1302998400,6,1587,4.613475177304965

So I watched this mini-series and immediately it was not what I thought it was going to be. The more I watched this movie, the more I wished I hadn't. It was the largest waste of time. There are no words to describe how horrible this was. If I want to read about some random OC hooking up with Darcy than I can read some crappy fanfiction and only wasted five maybe ten minutes of my life. I also hate the absolute assumption that any woman who stand up to Mr. Darcy and speak back is instantly going to win his heart. It's distasteful and a major slap to Jane Austen's work. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth had a connection and it has been that connection that has inspired and awed millions. It's disrespectful and completely horrible. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone and I would warn them ahead of time before they watched it. It was worse than the third Harry Potter which was a complete disaster. I wouldn't recommend to my worse enemy and I certainly would sue if any lawyer would take my case. It was horrible and I hope no one who completely utterly loves the relationship and romance of Darcy and Elizabeth waste their time on their horrible piece of medium that some one called a movie.",1301702400,7,1295,4.377593360995851

This movie is for that person.

It is possible to do lighthearted, very funny parody while retaining affection and respect for the source material; indeed, with the wonderful job the BBC has done with various adaptation of Austen works, that's the tone I expected. Ironically, the protagonist of this work is a young modern lady who uses Austen for escapism - but, when ""lost in"" the world of Austen's characters, does her best to re-make her surroundings in the image of her own pointless and vulgar twenty-first century life.

Individual scenes are somewhat amusing, but not often enough to redeem the short-sighted, mean-spirited arrogance of the work as a whole.  Buy this as a gift for your own favorite vulgar harpy - then ask yourself why you HAVE a favorite vulgar harpy at all.",1301097600,16,1199,4.805825242718447

3134680,3,B0014T7ETQ,"This movie/miniseries could've been good in so many ways.  The concept is intriguing; after all, what Jane Austen fan would NOT like to be magically transported into one of the greatest love stories of the era?!  There are a lot of positives going for this:  many of the characters have been wonderfully cast (this is my favorite Mr. Wickham & Mr. Bingley by far!), the settings are lovely, the costumes are exquisite, Mr. Darcy smolders just as he should.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of negatives as well:
1. Mr. Darcy --as wonderfully disdainful and moody as he is-- wears on his face the most comical look of disapproval for most of the movie.  Uncock that eyebrow a wee bit, won't ya?  It makes you look silly.
2. Amanda Price...oh dear, where do I start?!  Even I --an uncouth and unrefined American-- would've been able to bluff my way around Jane Austen's England better than this character!  She's crass, she stands there with mouth gaping open for most of the movie.  I agree with previous complaints:  for someone who'd been well-versed in ""Pride & Prejudice"" since she was 12 years old, Amanda Price should've just KNOWN BETTER!  She sounds like a blithering idiot for most of the time.  She lies and manipulates; she says and does the most ridiculous, cringe-worthy things!
3. Given #2, how is it comprehensible that Mr. Darcy would fall in love with Miss Price?  It's just silly! There is nothing redeemable in her character, except that she is obviously fond of the Bennett's.  She shows no great substance in the movie, nothing that sets her apart as decent or worthy of his affection.  Just baffling.
4.  Elizabeth Bennett--what the what?!  How on earth, since we know the great affection with which she holds her sister Jane and father, can she so suddenly and completely abandon them?  Does not compute.

So there are obviously some flaws in the portrayals of the characters, though not (in my opinion) as many as some reviews would have you to believe.  I was entertained by the further delving into some aspects that Jane Austen never touched (Mr. Collins brothers, LOL!, Lady Catherine de Bourgh as an ally, Miss Bingley's secret, hehe).  These do not fit with the *original*...but I don't feel they do much harm to the integrity of the classic.  Artistic license and pretty funny, at that.

Overall, the movie is entertaining, but not one that I think I can watch over and over (after the first time through, I had to fast-forward through all of Miss Price's social blunders and verbal diarrhea to make it tolerable.)  But...Mr. Darcy (as portrayed here) is smoldering and moody and very, very engaging to watch!",1300147200,3,2638,4.785398230088496

3134685,5,B0014T7ETQ,"Expectation is everything.  The Buddhists remind us that there is danger in attachment, and so it is with this film.  If you are too strongly attached to one set of ideas regarding Pride and Prejudice, then this film is not for you.  To completely enjoy all it has to offer one must be willing to abandon prefigured expectation.

I have been an ardent student and fan of Jane Austen for just over fifty years now and this experience has given me my own set of ideas.  My first encounter with Jane was in a book, not on the screen.  In fact there was only one film of a Jane Austen novel way back then, and that original version of Pride and Prejudice was much more Hollywood than Jane Austen.  If you wanted to read a book you had to have a book, not an e-reader.  Letters were written on paper and went snail mail, and there were no mobile phones or portable computers.  A lot has changed in fifty years, so we must be mindful of the change that has occurred in two-hundred years.  This change is part of the fun of Lost in Austen.

As a rule I don't care at all for the current industry of producing Jane Austen ""sequels"" although not for the most obvious reason.  Jane Austen has taught me to look for more than just a story when I read any novel.  Most of the ""sequels"" are thin and do little more than attempt to capitalize on the perceived ""romance"" in the original novels.

Lost in Austen is not a ""sequel"" nor is it a parody.  It strikes me as being occasionally satirical, but of a certain set of Jane Austen fans, not of Jane's work.  I think we have a mistaken idea of who Jane Austen was, and that largely from the picture her family took great pains to shape for us.  If one reads the six major biographies and the remaining letters (most of the letters were likely destroyed by her family) a fuller picture of Jane emerges.  Jane was not an uptight, isolated, old spinster as has been suggested.  Were Jane to step into our world, she would likely adapt every bit as well as Lost in Austen's Lizzy Bennet does.  It is easier to adapt to a barrage of ""new"" things than it is to tolerate a lack of ""old"" things we have come to take for granted.  This is one of the messages of the film.

It is my firm belief that Jane would seriously enjoy this film once she had adapted to our time and its oddities.  Certainly Amanda Price is profane and crude, as are we all compared to the people of Jane's world.  That is one of the points of the film.  The original novel is often very biting in its criticism, always ironic, occasionally satirical, frequently funny, but rarely romantic.  The other films try to sell us romance, and the better ones also present us with Jane's detail allowing us to see contrasts, folly and conceit.

I think some folks object to this film because of multiple factors.  Perhaps they misunderstand Jane.  It seems clear they misunderstand the novels.  They forget that Jane wrote novels not scripture and was hopeful of making money at it.  And finally I think the complainers misunderstand this film.  It does not poke fun at Jane or her novel.  It does clearly poke fun at us, and attempts to remind us all that we should not take her work too seriously after all.  For any who know the novel well, there are many plays in the film on events or dialogue in the book.

I highly recommend this film, and do agree that a refresher viewing of the 1995 Colin Firth film is essential as is a thorough understanding of the novel to the greatest enjoyment of it.  Just remember, Coleridge's ""willing suspension of disbelief"" is also quite helpful to the maximum enjoyment of Lost in Austen.  As a note, I have noticed on IMDB that there seems to be another Lost in Austen in the works for this year.  It will be interesting to see what they do with a second one.",1298332800,5,3791,4.347578347578348
3134686,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I LOVE this movie!  I know the whole time-travel, enter-into-your-favorite-book fantasy thing has been done over and over again, but I love it anyway!",1298332800,,150,5.25
3134687,4,B0014T7ETQ,"Okay, when I first watched this film, I have to be honest: the Austenite in me was absolutely horrified and hated it! But, like a horrible automobile accident, I couldn't stop watching it. And, at the conclusion, I realized that somewhere along the journey in this convoluted,  mixed-up Austen fantasy world, I fell in love with ""Lost in Austen""! Now, I laugh out loud at the things our modern day heroine, Amanda Price, goes through in Austenland, and the modern twists she brings to this familiar story are hilarous!

My tip: make SURE to pause the movie right before Caroline Bingley asks Amanda to sing, then pull up any You-tube video that shows the next, missing scene: Amanda singing ""Downtown"". HILARIOUS! I think I watched that scene 50 times. Then, go back to the film. I think they couldn't procure the rights to the song for the DVD, so they had to cut that scene... but it NEEDS to be in the story. Watching Darcy's face while she is singing is priceless.

So, in short: throw aside all your Pride & Prejudice expectations or Austenite prudishness and simply enjoy this funny film for what it is. Is it perfect? No. But it's very enjoyable. And, like if you, too, like Elizabeth Bennet, ""dearly love a laugh"" and delight ""in any thing ridiculous"", you will enjoy this film!",1298246400,,1286,4.656387665198238

The pop culture references are really amusing (wet shirt Darcy...'nough said). However, I really, really didn't care for the lead actor and actress. They didn't sell their performances very well. Here and there I was pleased with them, but over all Darcy was not just proud but he was angry and grumpy or something and Amanda was just not very likable. A major draw for the novel is that Elizabeth is very likable to the reader--the reader relates to and connects with Elizabeth. That is not AT ALL the case with Amanda. I think if they had picked a different lead actress, I would have liked the character more. Also, I was not expecting the ending. I'll not say anything more because I don't want to spoil anything for those who have not watched it, but the ending threw me off.
All in all, this movie just rubs me the wrong way, and no true Austen P&P fan will like this for more than a couple of viewings--just for the novelty of it. Watch it once so you can say you saw it, laugh at the funny bits, and then pass it along to someone else.",1297900800,,1220,4.285714285714286

- Amanda Price: ""Oh, Miss Bennet, I'm afraid I've made an absolute cockup of things. I have upset the apple cart. If only I hadn't met you in my loo that night and gone thru that damned magical door!""

- Elizabeth: ""But, Miss Price, I had thought this your fondest prospect, to escape the ennui of your modern-day existence and so inhabit that of your most beloved book.""

- Amanda: ""Bob's your uncle, Lizzie. May I call you Lizzie? Too soon? Okay. To answer, Miss Bennet, I very much fear I shan't ever get the hang of it, living in the Georgian era, talking couth, behaving with grace and decorum. I'm all out of sorts, y'see, and color me envious. I see you, on the other hand, have adapted quite well to my 21st Century. I've always reckoned you were a girl ahead of her time, Miss Bennet, and I was right. Cor, is that your mobile?""

- Elizabeth: ""I confess I exceedingly favor your London and its remarkable advances, Miss Price. And, yes, this is indeed my mobile. Kindly pardon me as I perform a rash of these text messages. There, a round of LOLs to all. And yet believe me when I say, Miss Price, that you retain my utmost attention with regards to your unfortunate plight. Pray, say on.""

- Amanda: ""Well, I've well and truly bollocksed it up, y'see. It's smack-dabbed in the middle of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice I've landed in, except that the plot's now gone completely off the rails, and it's all to do with my crass blunders and cluelessness and lack of proper elocution. The other night, Mr. Bingley, in avowing Mr. Darcy's utter disdain for dancing, stated that ""Mr Darcy regards all forms of sudden locomotion as a mark of ill breeding."" Oh, the wonderful language. I am rendered awestruck at the ease with which elegantly couched diction trips off these characters' tongues. It's bloody brilliant. I've read Pride & Prejudice so many times, I thought I'd fit in quite seamlessly. It turns out, I'm completely at sea, Miss Bennet, with your era two hundred years a-gone. But the dramatis personae are not whom I thought they were. And, most unfortuitous of all, Miss Bennet, Mr. Darcy, that elegant, prideful man you were destined to marry has fallen for someone else... because you're not here, y'see? And poor Mr. Bingley! The poor gentleman has resolutely taken to drink. Oh, I wish we had not swapped places! I make a poor substitute for you, Miss Bennet.""

- Elizabeth: ""My dear Miss Price, you do yourself a great disservice. Surely the state of affairs could not be so horrid. But I profess, I do not know this Mr. Bingley of whom you are lamenting. As for your Mr. Darcy, I also have not had the pleasure of meeting the grand gentleman. And yet, oh, your declaration of my marital prospect does fill me with perturbation. Do you believe my dear Papa would think it amiss if I were to once more consider a protracted turn in your contemporary London? In your bustling world, Miss Price, I feel... unconfined.""

- Amanda: ""Oh, that's right, duh. We swapped places just when Austen's story was starting. And your presence is sorely marked by its absence. Tell me, Miss Bennet, do you know who Colin Firth is? He looks a bit like Mr. Darcy.""

- Elizabeth: ""Yes, I have seen Mr. Firth admirably ensconced in - what do you call those? - ah, moving pictures, and regard his countenance as most pleasing and not without an air of nobility. Sir Laurence Olivier is another whose not unhandsome features I have glimpsed in your cinema. I cannot believe that your Mr. Darcy is in any form superior to these two inestimable persons.""

- Amanda: ""Whatever. My biggest concern, Miss Bennet, is that I am simply not you, everyone's beloved and timeless heroine! How will people accept me? By standards of the Georgian period, I am not fit for polite company. I evidence indelicate manners and demonstrate lewd and vulgar conduct, a modern girl utterly out of her element. Oh, the subversiveness of it. I mean, I got caught smoking a ciggy! How will anyone like me? I'm lively like you, but, I'm afraid, lively in all the wrong ways. Please, Miss Bennet, dissuade me from these anxious thoughts or, if you are of like mind, be so kind as to concur with three dots.""

She reads Pride and Prejudice over and over with some teasing from friends.  Through a quirk of fate she is switched to the past and changes places with Elizabeth Bennett.  What fun to watch Amanda as she tries clumsily to adapt to Regency England culture!  Amanda tries to manipulate events for the Bennett family but things don't go as she expects. The plot twists and turns satisfyingly.  I Loved the references to Colin Firth's Pride & Prejudice,too.  As a fan of Austen's, I wasn't keen on watching this but was delightfully surprised.

She switches places with Elizabeth Bennett and events start going wrong immediately for Ms Price.

In essence, the movie turns the story on its ear.  Characters from the novel are not acting as Ms Price knows they should, and she tries to set things aright--with very limited success.  We learn that Austen had somewhat misjudged some of the characters, Wickam in particular.  All that adds to the enjoyment.

But if you've ever sat and read the book, saw an Austen movie, and closed your eyes and wished a thousand times that you could go back in time and live in Jane Austen's day, this is great entertainment. How many of us wish we could be part of Darcy's world? Meet a man with manners or live in a world without TV's, iPods, computers and learn what the true intercourse of conversation meant? How true it would be that our modern lifestyles would actually make it very hard for us to adapt into a time and place we merely romanticize over and over again. How odd those characters would think our mannerisms were in return!

The series does just that, only Amanda's arrival sort of ""buggers"" up the story, if you get my drift. Nothing goes like it should and she tries to fix it all to the way it's suppose to be written in the book. Darcy, of course, is wonderfully attractive, the absolute snob, who can't figure out why he's ""tormented"" and attracted to a woman he frankly considers vulgar. It's fiction living inside of fiction - a phenomenal idea.

All I can say to the die-hard Austen fans, is lighten up folks! It's meant to be fun and enjoyable, not a perfect rendition of the original. It's called creative liberty. What always amazes me about obsessed fans of certain genre, is that they treat the originals as if they were written by the finger of God on stone and we're not to change, alter, or enjoy it in any other manner.

3134716,5,B0014T7ETQ,"What girl has read or seen Pride and Prejudice and not fantasized being Elizabeth Bennett?
A brief synopsis:  The current heroine, 21st century Amanda, is enthralled with Pride and Prejudice; through a time portal in her bathroom, she gets to change places with the novel's heroine Elizabeth Bennett. The filmmakers take this in two directions simultaneously....

* First,  Amanda creates a butterfly effect in that all the novel characters behave as one might expect but the outcome is quite different than what Jane Austen wrote for her characters.
* Second, Amanda is a fish out of water as she navigates a 200 year old society, while Elizabeth is coming to terms with the 21st century.

There are lots of little fun takeoffs and surprises.... For instance,
* The pond scene from the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice (Colin Firth version)is mimicked.
* The Charlotte Lucus character goes off in an entirely different direction.... literally
*  Jane's marriage is not what one would expect
* Amanda's virginity becomes an issue
* Mr. Darcy pays a visit to 21st century London (another fish out of water)
* The 18th century characters are properly impressed with Amanda's income of 25,000/year.
* Elizabeth is asked to play at the piano, she apparently played Petula Clark's Downtown

3134719,5,B0014T7ETQ,"Lost In Austen was a British mini series directed by Oscar winner Sam Mendes and written by Guy Andrews, and it was one of the most popular offerings on British television in 2008.

In fact, it was so popular that they brought it to the big screen. This charming homage to Pride and Prejudice and Jane Austen herself is an absolute delight.

Jemima Rooper is Amanda Price who steps through the portal between her reality and the fictional world inhabited by the Bennet family. Elliot Cowan is the smoldering Mr. Darcy. Hugh Bonneville is paternal as Mr. Bennet.

Florence Hoath is Kitty Bennet. Alex Kingston is Mrs. Bennet. Morven Christie is Jane Bennet. Perdita Weeks is Lydia Bennet. Tom Mison is Mr. Bingley. Ruby Bentall is Mary Bennet. Christina Cole is Caroline Bingley, and Gemma Arterton is Elizabeth Bennet. Tom Riley is Mr. Wickham, and Guy Henry is Mr. Collins.

The story goes like this. . . .

Amanda Price is an ardent Jane Austen fan who has read Pride and Prejudice too many times. Saddled with a boozy boy friend who has no shred of romance in his soul, she longs for the genteel world inhabited by Elizabeth Bennet.

When Amanda finds Elizabeth Bennet standing in her bathtub one night, her world as she knows it changes. Elizabeth tells her she stepped through a doorway in her attic, a door that had never opened before, and ended up in Amanda's bathrub. Before you can say alternate reality, Amanda is trapped in Jane Austen's world of mannered courtship and matchmaking intrigue.

Of course, Amanda's presence changes the course of Austen's novel so the poor girl ends up trying to keep the story on course. I won't spoil the story. Suffice it to say that you'll be surprised. It's an affectionate homage that will enchant you and make you glad to be Lost In Austen.",1280707200,,1790,4.681528662420382
3134720,5,B0014T7ETQ,"This film is a great mix of witty British humour and Jane Austen's classic masterpiece. If you like both of those, you'll probably enjoy ""Lost in Austen"". It's sympathetic to the original story, and rather than mocking it (like some other Austen take-offs) I felt it paid homage to the timelessness of the themes in ""Pride and Prejudice"". Two hundred years later, people still have the same feelings, despite the way they might speak, dress and pass their days. It's a testament to both Austen's writing and the writers/producers of this film.

(I won't recount the plot here, as it's been covered many times elsewhere.)

Aside from being an entertaining twist on the original story, I found it very interesting to see how the ""original characters"" were portrayed in comparison to earlier versions of P&P. It's not just silly comedy - these characters are well-developed and well-acted and not what you may have been programmed to expect. Mrs. Bennet in particular was played in a very different, yet still relevant and believable light, than in the 1995 version. Jemima Rooper did a great job as Amanda, skillfully blending the comedic aspects of the role with the dramatic elements of the story line.

I suspect a few jokes and comments here and there will be lost on non-British viewers, and I think it's a shame that a few scenes from the original series (as aired on TV in the UK)were cut.",1280448000,3,1394,4.8

Elizabeth and Darcy are meant to be together, and I sat up thinking over and over about whether I would chose Mr. Darcy for myself if given the chance.

The main appeal is that it speaks to a secret fantasy of what would happen if YOU could enter ""Pride and Prejudice""?  Jane Austen's work is so finely crafted that it seems impossible that society doesn't exist.  Surely you could actually be there, you must be able to step into Longbourn and meet the Bennet family.  So when this movie depicts that very thing of going back in time and reality, it gives you permission to explore the idea.  What if you could gaze into Darcy's eyes and hear his voice?  What would you say, how would you react??  What about trading places with Lizzy Bennet??

There are moments that are poignant & heartbreaking but then others so funny it's hard to find room for them both.

I must have seen that version a good 50 -100 times I should think!  I have since rented a few other versions of the movie just for comparison sake.  So yes, I do love the story.

I love the costumes of the day and the manners.  I too have imagined myself in the story...and I am good friends with Jane and Lizzie, and I end up with Colonel Fitzwilliam.  Lol!  So I loved the premise of this story.

I loved how the characters didn't duplicate the A&E version exactly.  Although I do have to admit that Mr. Collins was truly awful - more awful than I would have imagined him.  I liked to see how things changed because Lizzie was not there and because Amanda was.  It reminds me of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" when George Bailey sees how everything changes when he is not there.  It's remarkable what can happen all because of one person.  And I honestly liked the twist that they made with Mr. Wickham.  It was refreshing not to dislike him.

Mr. Darcy is just magnificent and his character is played the same way it has been played since Laurence Olivier did it in 1940 with his haughtiness and incomparable benediction. The only downside to an otherwise great version was that a very funny scene in which Jemima sings ""Downtown"" has been cut and leaves the viewer scratching its head because of the conversation followed right after.

3134734,4,B0014T7ETQ,"Watching `Lost in Austen', starring Jemima Rooper and Elliot Cowen is a great way to while away your afternoon if you are craving for a continuation of Darcy and Elizabeth's story.  But wait!  This isn't your typical sequel.  For that matter this isn't your typical movie.  At almost three hours long, 'Lost in Austen' gives Historical Romance fans of these modern days exactly what we've been craving, a hysterical adaptation of the BBC's 1995 rendition of 'Pride and Prejudice'.

Amanda Price, a cute red head in her mid-twenties, lands in the 19th-century world of author Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice.' She does this through what appears to be a bathroom cabinet door.  Already a huge fan of Austen, Amanda has at least some knowledge of the characters on the book, but is a fish out of water when it comes to customs and vernacular of the time period.

From the start, we must suspend belief.  This is a movie where the entire premise is based upon time travel into early 1800's.  Once you allow yourself to let go of science and reality, you are ready for an enchantingly wild ride.  Honestly, whoever made `Lost in Austen' realized we were ridiculously spoiled by the length and utter indulgences with character development we received with the BBC's rendition of `Pride and Prejudice.'

Miss Price is stuck in the past and Miss Bennet is trapped in the future.  In her attempts to fix the fact that she's bungling the story line, Amanda's first act is to send Jane through the rain to Netherfield.  This seems to be the only thing from the book that goes to plan.

Casting was a bit spotty for the movie, with some characters being wonderfully done and others physically lacking.  Wickham's treatment is fabulous and I'll probably be flogged for saying it, the most transformed and most enhanced character of the movie.  Bingley is, as always, simply adorable.  Kitty and Mary were cast perfectly.

I think there were problems with Lady Catherine, Mr. Bennet, Mrs Bennet and Miss Bingley.  Although Miss Bingley was as vapid and cruel as she reads, her looks didn't seem to match how I pictured her in my head.

We're wonderfully thrown off course and taken down a wild set of events that have Amanda fending off the advances of more than one man and even accepting a proposal.

The period people's reactions to our modern everyday non sequiturs are completely adorable.  During an intimate, almost sisterly moment, when asked by Jane what Amanda Price thinks of Mr. Darcy her response is pretty humorous.  `He's not Colin Firth, but even Colin Firth isn't Colin Firth.'

There are parts of the movie, where in modern times; Amanda's character would have been arrested for being considered a stalker.  Saying fantastical things and knowing intimate details.  As it is, she is considered eccentric and behaves `rather oddly familiar' with her friends.

As someone who cans and preserves actively, there is a wonderful scene where Mrs. Bennet brings Jane a bunch of jars of goodies when she visits her in her new home.

The treatment of Bingley and Jane is especially juicy because he has always been a conundrum to those of us who have `type A' personalities.  The writers for `Lost in Austen' really could have focused more of the film on them and not lost an ounce of their audience.  I was pulled into their struggled and wanted to see more of their plot line unfolding.

As it is, we do see it develop and a very satisfying resolution, but is any Austen fan really ever satisfied?  If you are reading this column, you are clearly not!  Sequels were made for people like us and will continue to be as long as we rant and rave about it!

Is it sacrilegious to toy with the base morals of the main characters in the original novel for the purpose of moving the story forward?  If it works, no.  For `Lost in Austen' it worked very well.  Admittedly this doesn't work all the time and sequels can become utter failures if done poorly.  However, we may be predisposed to allow it in this instance because we are already set in a `modern' tone for the romp.
individually to retain this template's appearance. Mr. Darcy in 'Lost in Austen'

There are parts of the movie where the bottom of your stomach drops out because of how the original plot of `Pride and Prejudice' has been so terribly muddled.  Characters you've put so much faith in have turned so far from the path you've known them to walk upon you fear the worst, but fear not.  It turns out for the best in the end.

I really highly recommend watching this movie.  If you have watched it, watch it again.  WARNING:  It is NOT for purists.  There are characters that are turned completely OUT of character, but as I've mentioned, it works.

Watch it simply for the few balls it shows.  I'll admit to the ridiculous joy in watching and enjoying those.  I'm a little like Lydia in that regard.

I did not purchase it but went to the local video store to rent it.  I am so glad I did because I took it back that night after I watched it. This movie took the wonderful story of Pride & Prejudice and ripped it to shreds, making Mr. Bingley a drunk, sending Charlotte abroad as a missionary and having Mr. Wickham as a victim of Georgiana Darcy. I could not stand the main character or the actress who played her and did not find Mr. Darcy handsome or appealing. If you like Pride & Prejudice, avoid this movie.

Darcy decides he loves that sleazy, lying goofball Amanda, then changes his mind, then he loves her again, then changes his mind...and on it goes.  And Amanda walks around in some sleazy outfit, while the Bennett girls barely bat an eyelash...as if they wouldn't be completely scandalised by her lack of appropriate clothes.  The whole idea is so insane.

3134744,4,B0014T7ETQ,"OK. Now, everyone calm down. No, this is not a faithful adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice."" Hint: It's not supposed to be. It's the crazy story of a modern-day woman who falls into the pages of her favorite Austen novel and screws everything up. Is it the best thing I have ever seen? No. Was I glued to my seat for the entire three hours? Yes. Did this movie have issues? You bet'cha. Do I recommend it? In the immortal words of Mr. Bennett in ""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""read on"":

The hits:
1.) I loved the casting of Darcy. Not only was Elliot Cowan swoon-worthy (a pre-requisite in any Darcy casting), but the man could smolder with the best of them. Although, it must be said that this guy looks a lot like Stephen Moyer from ""True Blood.""

2.) I loved the twists and turns in this movie. You never knew where they were going to go next. There are three OMG bits, two oh-no-you-didn't parts, and a seriously loud screaming at the top of your lungs while clapping at the same time scene. (Believe me; you will know when you get to that last one especially.)

3.) I loved the interaction between the new heroine, Amanda Price, and Mr. Darcy. I loved how she not only seemed to get beneath his skin (like Elizabeth in the book), but she dug even deeper than that. She could make that man scream at her and lose his composure completely. Now, I have always been of a mind that the person who can make you that nuts is the one you should marry. Yes, Elizabeth and Darcy were much wittier in the book, and it was a pleasure to the senses and all that, but it was refreshing to see Darcy knocked for such a loop that he would yell at a woman he barely knew. It was nice to see him come down off his pedestal a little quicker than he does in the book.

4.) I loved that they made Miss Bingley is lesbian. It was totally inappropriate and wrong for her character, but I loved it nonetheless.

The misses:
1.) The fact that so many of the manners of that time period were ignored and, at times, bulldozed over by Amanda---all with no one seeming to care. It seemed out of place to me that she would show up in modern clothes and it would take that long for anyone to make her change. There are also the copious amounts of make-up she wears, the overall lack of couth on her part, and her ignorance of the common manners of the time. This is supposed to be a woman who has practically memorized ""Pride and Prejudice."" She should know what the right thing to do is as well as the wrong. Then, there is the fact that a large number of these wrong things are not even commented on by anyone. Common trollops wore make-up back then, not proper misses. Ms. Bingley (as much as she disdains anyone without good breeding) would have publically chastised Amanda about this if no one else. And don't get me started on Amanda's hair . . .

2.) The on-again/off-again engagements/weddings weren't realistic or even possible. That Mr. Collins would become engaged with Amanda and then just end it at the Netherfield ball is ridiculous. A man was pretty much cemented into an engagement once his proposal was accepted. A woman had a little more wiggle room here, but both parties would be subjected to harsh sanctions by society by ""crying off"" without some just and public cause. Then, there is the quick engagement between Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley. (which is never really talked about again later now that I think about it.) How is it that Miss Bingley, a woman whose sole mission was to secure Darcy, would blithely let him go to be with someone else? Why would a man such as Darcy make such a reckless proposal in the first place? Plus, there is the fact that, once someone as prideful and correct as Darcy popped the question and was accepted, he would follow through on the marriage. There would be no choice. Last, the marriage between Mr. Collins and Jane is utterly moronic. That the man would not consummate the marriage is contrived (as much as the fact that he would happily dissolve the marriage just because Lady Catherine told him to). Parts like these seemed to be written in simply for shock value. It cheapened the movie overall, and irritated the crap out of me.

3.) The idea that Bingley would fall for Amanda first is ludicrous. In the book, Bingley is beguiled at first by Jane's beauty, but falls in love with her sweet, gentle demeanor and overall generous presence. Since Amanda hasn't any of these qualities to recommend her, it felt a little foolish that Mr. Bingley would become enamored with her. Then, when you add the fact that Amanda gets drunk at the first assembly and makes out with Bingley in a darkened alley, you accelerate from ludicrous to the repeatedly-slapping-your-head-against-a-brick-wall-for-fun kind of stupid. I found myself screaming, ""What the hell are you doing?"" during that scene especially.

4.) I hated how they turned Wickham into a good guy. C'mon! Everyone knows Wickham is the unrepentant bad boy, and, honestly, I love him because of that. If you notice, there is a bad boy in every one of Austen's novels. I think she, like the rest of her sex, had a tendre for them. Who doesn't? So, making him into the nice guy is akin to taking a stud horse, cutting off his Johnson, and putting him out in the paddock with all the mares. What is the point? (And, while I am pointing it out: Why make Georgiana---in the two scenes they gave her---into a lying brat? I hated that one especially).

So, what is my recommendation? Well, if you are looking for a movie that is ""faithful to the original classic tale"" or some other such nonsense, look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you are looking for a rollercoaster ride of fun, shock, and laughs, I highly recommend this piece of fluff. You will not believe the three hours have gone by this quickly and, whether you have issues with it or not, I guarantee you will be clapping at the end.",1269216000,4,5871,4.474323062558357

""Lost in austen"" is the first thing I've seen that I haven't turned off in disgust. It's saving grace is that the main character, the girl who gets ""lost"" in Austen, is also a P&P snob with regards to the book and the A&E version. This matters because she comments on the fact that its not ""the original."" Her acknowledgment makes it okay somehow. For example, when she first meets Mr. Darcy, she says ""Well, he's no Colin Firth."" As she's screwing everything up, she realizes it.

I loved it and was excited to buy it on DVD when it was made available in the US.  It is still a great movie, but I was rather disappointed that one of my favorite scenes was cut.  I love when Amanda sings ""Downtown"" and feel it is an important part of the movie, but was sad and disappointed it was not included.  It makes the rest of that scene rather awkward because the audience does not know what she sang or did to entertain them.  One wonders if they were too cheap to pay the copyright on the song and therefore felt American audiences could do without one of the best scenes of the movie.

The premise of what would happen if you could step into the book and meet the delicious Mr Darcy has many clever twists and outright laughs.  It also enticed my 17 year old to put down Twilight and pick up P&P. We caught this movie on BBCA, and immediately ordered it from Amazon. We have watched it several times, and have given as gifts.  The clever takes on many of the iconic scenes from P&P (favorite: Mr Darcy and the pond) invite you to join in on the fun the modern day Amanda is having with all of Miss Austen's characters.

I expected to hate it and turn it off before the end, especially since it is three hours long- but I loved it!  I am a HUGE P&P fan, have researched the book extensively and even wrote my masters thesis on it.  I know the characters, plot, scenes, and dialouge inside out and backwards.  The screen writer took everything we know about P&P and re-interpreted it.  IT WORKED!  Granted, there are somethings for which you will have to suspend your disbelief- the fact that a secret door to the Bennet's home magically opens in Amanda Price's bathroom for one- but that is what give the movie a lot of it's charm.  It is a re-invention of the story, the answer to the ""I wish I was Elizabeth Bennet!"" day dream!  No one can replace Elizabeth, the story DOES get botched without her, but it is a very funny journey to watch!  Especially with the references to the 1995 BBC mini-series.
I give 4/5 stars because the development of Darcy and Amanda's relationship is supposed to mirror that of Darcy and Elizabeth's, but misses the mark slightly for me.  However, this is the absolute BEST portrayal of Bingly I have ever seen, hands down, Tom Mison absolutely nails it.  Its definitely a different Bingly than the novel, but I think the new story line lends itself well to an otherwise shallow character.  We get a bit more depth to him, and he is no less loveable!
If you are a P&P fan and go into this move knowing that it is not supposed to be a faithful re-telling, then I think you will enjoy it!  If you don't like straying from tradition, perhaps this is not the film for you!",1261267200,,1659,4.382352941176471

I was able to get the British mini-series as shown on TV (PAL) and boy what a difference editing with a chainsaw makes!  While the one sold here is funny, the original is really the best since it provides more insight into Amanda's relationship with her boyfriend, etc., things that really didn't make sense.

They are more like family dramas where people are trying to get on with the business of life. Love is more of an accident than a goal.

That being said, I found this movie very interesting. I really liked the actress who played Elizabeth, as she had an incandescence that Darcy would have found intriguing had he had the chance to know her. Much as I found myself rooting for the modern girl, she couldn't hold a candle to Elizabeth. But I did love how well Elizabeth adjusted to the present, from her haircut to her earrings to her using the computer.

Two things that bugged me? Amanda's hair! She never puts it up! She's in the Regency clothes but it never dawns on anyone to give her a bobby pin? So aggravating. Second, Mr. Collins was downright repulsive. He's a buffoon, not a pervert.

Otherwise it was a fascinating take on Austen's tale. Some parts were a little too melodramatic (Mr. Bennet dueling made me roll my eyes) and Amanda was far too modern in clothes and attitude to strike me as a rabid Austen fan. I think it would've been interesting if she'd been forced to read the book for a college course then found herself in the story.",1260230400,2,1299,4.404166666666667

3134785,5,B0014T7ETQ,"There's nothing deep or literary about Lost in Austen. It's a time travel tale that incorporates all the standard glitches, as 21st century Amanda tries to navigate her way around the style and conventions of the 19th century. Because she curls up with Austen every time she feels stressed, Amanda knows what should be happening in this strange new (old) world, but somehow, the characters simply won't behave as planned.

If not taken too seriously, this foray into Pride and Prejudice is delightful. It's genuinely entertaining to watch well known and loved  characters adopt wills of their own. Jemima Rooper as Amanda is spot on, as she struggles to speak and conduct herself in accordance with Regency mores. Elliot Cowan makes a fine Mr. Darcy, although at times he seems to be channeling Heathcliff instead, and Tom Mison as Mr. Bingley threatens to upstage Darcy at several points. Supporting cast members are equally true to form. The scenery is stunning, and costumes reflect proper period detail, despite their rather muted colors.

Interestingly, our heroine is a modern day Londoner who is in love with the world of Austen's creation. Specifically, Pride & Prejudice. I can get being so into a book that you read it over and over. But wanting to live in that time period? Why would any modern woman want to go back to that time? Yet I did believe that Amanda was truly in love with the book, the characters, that world.

I love the faithfulness to Austen's original work with little bits tweaked just enough to fit Amanda in. It really draws you into the story - so much so that I watched the entire thing in (mostly) one sitting - and was annoyed when I had to pause to go do other things briefly.

I agree with other reviewers that it was a good idea, but horrendously done.  All the original ""Pride and Prejudice"" characters are distorted, unrecognizable.  Why can't our time traveler meet characters that are true to the way Jane Austen described them?  And why do they all so easily accept Lizzy's absence?  And why would Darcy ever fall in love with such an unlikable woman?

3134794,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I caught this series on the Ovation channel. I was disdainful but curious and watched the show ready to hate it. I ended up loving it instead. The actors are outstanding, the story is very creative and there are little twists and changes in some of the characters that we have come to love and hate from Pride and Prejudice. I was ready to hate Amanda (the modern, dropped in character) and ended up falling in love with her. She was combination of softness and strength and had the brashness of a modern girl, I often fantasize about when reading a period novel. Not quite in your face but very straightforward.

I apologize to P&P die-hard fans, but I was very glad that Elizabeth was not in the series that much. I have always found her to be irritating but the actress that plays her is quite lovely and what I imagined Elizabeth to look like. If you are into Lizzie, this may not be the series for you.

Word of advise though. When purchasing, check you DVD asap. I'd purchase this DVD straight from Amazon and my copy is missing Amanda's performance of ""Downtown"". It wasn't a skip, but a complete cut of this scene. I stopped watching it because I frankly did not want to find any other scenes missing.

However, I did give the series a 5 star rating because the series itself is sensational.

If you are a die-hard fan of P&P, I hope you are open because this is a lovely fantasy for anyone that has ever wanted to be with Mr. Darcy.",1254268800,2,1441,4.365671641791045
3134795,5,B0014T7ETQ,"We are living through a great age of Jane Austen inspired prequels/sequels and revisions.  Would she be amused or insulted that her works, Pride and Prejudice in particular, have inspired so many others to project what their vision is or what they feel was not stated on the written page?  Who can say, but I personally like to think that somewhere she feels a bit bemused and a bit chagrined, winking and enjoying the whole lot all the same.

Amanda Price (charmingly played by the ever talented Jemima Rooper) is a 21st century London girl, unsatisfied with her life and eager to escape her world through the pages of her favorite novel - Pride and Prejudice.  She visualizes the written world of Pemberley, Longbourne and Rosings in her mind and longs for the romance of it all.  Always be careful what you wish for, my dear, for you just might get it and it may turn out to be far more complicated that what you've envisioned.  Enter Elizabeth Bennet (rising star Gemma Arterton) through a doorway portal and commence the hijinks.

The entire cast works well together, but the Wickham turnaround in the hands of the excellent Tom Ripley was a particularly witty plot twist that worked well.  The classically trained Elliot Cowan was a marvelous Mr. Darcy and had excellent screen chemistry with Ms. Rooper.  I'm a Janeite and have either read or watched marvelous adaptations as well as lackluster interpretations.  This is, most assuredly, the former and not the latter.",1254009600,4,1475,4.817460317460317
3134796,2,B0014T7ETQ,"It was with a bit of trepidation that I decided to watch this movie. I figured it was likely to be stupid, but I was in the mood for a bit of mindless fun, so I went with it.
Don't get me wrong, there is mindless fun to be had - but this film has no artistic merit whatsoever (which must be why so many people seem to love it).

At the start, I thought it might be okay - I mean, here's this girl Amanda, her favorite book is Pride and Prejudice, she's disappointed with modern life, and she gets a chance to go back in time and see what life was really like - not her romantic idealization of the whole Elizabeth-Darcy courtship.
She goes back and finds out that society was very rigid, restrictive, there were a lot of rules to follow and you couldn't even get a decent toothbrush!
Right up till about the point when Darcy tells Amanda he could never marry her, I felt like the film had some integrity - even if some of the liberties taken with the characters and their conversations were incongruous with the times in which they were set.
But then after that, consumed with the need to give everyone a happy ending, the plot becomes so ridiculous and contrived - as well as stretching the characters past recognition - that it is impossible to have any respect for the film or take any pleasure in the outcome for the characters.
All we Austen fans love Pride and Prejudice - I've read it a number of times, and the love story is always satisfying. But the truth is, Jane Austen wrote that book for the same reason so many novels get written: to create a world the way it should be, rather than the way it is. In real life, Darcy likely would not have married Elizabeth, even if he wanted to, for just the reasons stated clearly by him in the book. After all, Jane could not marry the man she loved because she lacked a fortune.
And even if Darcy and Elizabeth had married, there's no proof that they would have been as happy as Austen tells us they intend to be.
Women tended to have baby after baby, not a lot of freedom, and in Elizabeth's world, despite the money and status, quite a lot of tedious obligations to fulfill as part of her role.
I think a movie about a modern woman coming to realize just how unromantic the Regency period really was would have been far more compelling. Sure, the clothes were pretty - and the English countryside ravishing, but really, what modern woman would actually choose to live in a world where she had few rights or choices, marriage was a mercenary undertaking and she was entirely dependant on a husband or father for her support?
But I digress.
About the only character I thought was materially improved was Wickham. Am I the only one who's ever thought Austen was a little too harsh on him for enjoying having sex with women? Oh, I know, it was a different time and place, and the indulgence of a man's pleasure could ruin a woman, both financially and socially. So a man who toyed with women that was WAS truly a cad - but again, it comes back to the advantages of living in modern times, when sex and sexuality are more free and open - so it fits with the thesis of disillusionment with Austen romances...

And really, doesn't it strike anyone else as a little disappointing, that our heroine, who is trying to make right what she has screwed up, makes her promise to Lady Catherine, then runs back to Darcy?
It takes a little of the pleasure out of the moment to think that now Jane gets to stay stuck in her marriage to the hideous Mr. Collins.
I guess when it comes right down to it, I'm not really equipped for mindless fun - which this totally is. If you don't think about any of what it means and aren't bothered by a plot and characters that don't stay true to themselves - even as reinvented here - then I think you will enjoy this film.",1253923200,3,3797,4.3090909090909095

There are some moments when you slap your palm to your face and go, ""What the heck?""

I didn't like it.

it just seemed weird and odd that these character I love, their personalities are different & they're doing things they wouldn't do and things were twisted.

It's hard to explain :P

Mr & Mrs Bennet have an unhappy marriage.
Mr Wickham is actually good? And Caroline Bingley is a lesbian? Mr Bingley becomes a drunk? That is not what Jane Austen wrote. they can't just change that! It is supposed to be about a girl who stumbles into the world of Pride & Prejudice. Not a world where the Pride & Prejudice characters are not what they seem.

I also hated when they wanted to get a cheap laugh out of us in some parts. Like when Mr Darcy is on the bus and sees a child reading a tellytubbie book & then later sees a telly tubby doll and exclaims ""Tinky Winky!"" Not a very Mr Darcy thing to do. And the lesbian scene where Caroline Bingley confesses she is a lesbian.

I hated the ending. Elisabeth run off to the modern world unstead of being with Darcy, Amanda agree to marry her boyfriend & then run off with Darcy leaving him broken & without an explanation & Lady Catherine miraculously promises to Divorce Mr Collins & Jane.

The whole thing felt so strange that by the time Mr Bennet gets stabbed in the neck and is dying I realise I no longer care & I feel like switching it off. These were not the characters I've loved since my teens. Theses were modernised, depressing, twisted, cheap, cast offs and I didn't care about them one bit.

The only character I still liked was Jane. That was only because they didn't change her in anyway & that she was missing for half the show!

It was truely a strange experience watching this. It was a good idea and I looked forward to it and shunned bad reviews that I read before I watched it and I was even more keen about this than the idea of ""Pride & Prejudice an zombies"". But now I'm disapointed.

She scored because I rolled with laughter at this quirky Brittish tale where a modern day Londoner who is equally obsessed with Austen finds that a magical door into the world of Elizabeth Bennet opens up in her bathroom and Elizabeth herself walks out. Then, things happen and our new friend from modern day London winds up staying with Elizabeth's family while Elizabeth stays in London. Many many laughs come about from the various fish-out-of water scenarios and I happily recommend this to anyone who both loves period pieces and needs a good laugh!",1251072000,3,683,4.896551724137931

I happened to catch this series when it aired on PBS.  I had no idea what it was when I started watching it, but I soon realized that it was going to be something to do with Pride and Prejudice.  And so it was.  But it wasn't Pride and Prejudice as I'd ever seen it before!

Of course, the costumes, setting, and acting are all lovely (the British really know how to film these period pieces).  But I liked the way that Jane Austen's original story was turned on its head, allowing us to see the characters in a refreshing new light.  This is basically a story of ""what ifs"", and we get to see what might have happened had the characters made different decisions.

Purists probably won't like this series.  But I don't think it takes anything away from the original.",1250467200,2,974,4.302197802197802

3134816,1,B0014T7ETQ,"I was ready to go with it, I really was. I am not an Austen purist. I can take it when things are changed for movies, and obviously for this film things would be completely changed. So I went into it ready to just go along for the ride. Try as I might, I just couldn't do it. This was horrible! Terrible! I couldn't believe how many great reviews this got. I got about an hour and fifteen minutes into it, then I just couldn't take it anymore and started fast-forwarding so that I could see what happened without actually having to watch the thing anymore (I have to admit that I was curious as to where they were going to go with it). From what I saw it didn't get any better. Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books, and this in no way resembled any of it. Other than the name, I didn't recognize any of the characters. Mrs. Bennet was downright menacing, but not fun. Darcy was mean. Bingley was just pathetic. The things that these characters ended up doing were totally out of character for them (Jane marry Mr. Collins? She has far too much sense for that). It was as if the writer was focused on what he could make the characters do, rather than looking at what, if a stranger was dropped in their midst and Elizabeth wasn't there, the characters would naturally do. I felt like they just simply tacked the character name onto a character of their own making.

There were a lot of vulgar things in this movie. I am not a prude, but there are some things that I don't think are necessary (like Amanda flashing Lydia and discussing pubic hair). I had the feeling that Amanda was supposed to be the everywoman living out the fantasy of the Jane Austen addict (a chance to meet Mr. Darcy), but I feel really bad for modern women if she is truly representative. She is crass, crude, and, I am sorry to say, rather stupid. She bumbled through most of the movie, making no attempt to fit into the society in which she found herself. If she had truly read Pride and Prejudice as many times as she says she had, she would have known what was acceptable at the time and tried not to act as if she was in her own time.

I just simply couldn't bring myself to like Amanda. Apparently both Bingley and Darcy thought that she was very attractive, but I couldn't figure out why. I understand that Bingley got to see some leg (she was wearing pants) and down her shirt when she courtseyed, but I thought that he should have been better than that. Seeing him oggling her was disappointing. At the time, either one of them should have been embarrassed at the thought of bringing her into polite society. Why would they think of marrying her (Elizabeth and Jane's family was objectionable, but they never were)?

Overall, I was very disappointed in this. Crude and laughable without being funny, I felt that it was horrible. After I found out the ending (which, by the way, I won't reveal, but I don't get how that is supposed to be a happy ending for the viewer) I had to get out the original book to redeem the characters. At least I didn't buy this movie; I got if from the library.",1249430400,54,3081,4.336221837088388

This charming four-part ITV mini-series has been streamlined into a three hour film starring Jemima Rooper as Amanda Price and Elliot Cowan as the broodingly handsome Fitzwilliam Darcy and a delightful turn by Alex Kingston as Mrs. Bennett.  In keeping with the new millennium's revisionist takes on everything from Cinderella to Robin Hood to Sherlock Holmes, writer Guy Andrews has created an interesting ""what if"" screenplay.  What if a modern day woman named Amanda went thru a door in her bathroom and ended up in Regency England living with the Bennett family? What if Jane married badly?  What if Wickham wasn't a villain?  What if Mrs. Bennett had honest grievances? What if Elizabeth wanted a different life?

And gentle readers, I give it four stars instead of five because: there are no natural breaks in the lengthy one disc story, the script is very ironic and exhibits prochronisms such as antibiotics and lip gloss; and worst of all, we aren't privy to a major plot point because of a copyright issue.",1249430400,4,2262,6.485049833887043

One word: hilarious. I pretty much laughed my way throughout much of video. I had no idea what to expect, and I loved the amount of suspense throughout the entire show. Amanda knows the story by heart, and it was hilarious watching her trying to desperately keep things going the way they are written. How many times have you found yourself wishing that you had the chance to live in a different time? I know I've had a dream or two about that. Watching Amanda get the chance to do that was almost just as good!

Purist will not like how Jane Austin's classic is jumbled by Amanda.

Things start to fall apart at the end. Time portals start popping up all over and characters travel between the two at will.  A character's ""need"" drives the time portals but it becomes too sloppy a device for me.  The way Amanda kept pulling 21st century items, as needed, from her clothing seemed a bit much.

3134821,4,B0014T7ETQ,"""lost in austen"" is charming and lots of fun. at three hours long (it was originally four episodes on british tv) i never really felt the length. the plot was a clever blend of plot surprises (the ""wrong"" people falling in love) and character surprises. lady catherine is almost likable in this version and wickham, miss bingley and even lizzie have unexpected character changes.

you may not like all the changes and so many surprises, but this is a time travel fantasy so i parked all notions of verisimilitude outside and let my suspension of disbelief run wild. there was just so much fun to be had. and you can always go back and watch an authentic version or even reread the book. my 19 year-old daughter who has only seen the keira knightly film version (once), got completely hooked just walking by and sat down to watch the fun. she got an amazing number of the inside jokes, too, so you probably only need to know the basic plot to enjoy it. i really liked mr. bennet, who seemed to grow as the film wore on. i never really warmed to this darcy that much, but he wasn't allowed the dramatic interventions that showed us another side of him. instead, we see an even harder side of him. lizzie, in a severely shortened role, is remarkable and her character really ""worked"" for me. and i really enjoyed the creation of the other collinses, from lizzie's random remark in the novel where she wonders in mr. collins has a cousin. and this really is the ""worst"" (or best worst) collins ever.

i also liked the modern girl, amanda, who longs for civility an charm so lacking in her life and times. it's also cool that she's a working class girl and not privileged in any way except in her heart.

i enjoyed it enough to buy it after i'd watched it on a rental. that's becoming rarer and rarer, i think, so that's a considerable compliment in itself. i've now watched it five or six times since my purchase and i still find it charming. the writer seems to have had quite a lot of fun and you can tell that in almost every scene.",1249084800,3,2031,4.410666666666667

Being a Jane Austen fan I looked forward to seeing a movie of a modern-aged Jane Austen reader being trapped in the works of Jane Austen.  I wonder, however, how a woman so indecent, so crass could read the works of Jane Austen, and it not affect her behavior in a positive manner.  This woman, was in her conversation, so repulsive that she would have probably been arrested, or at the very least, shunned.  What an insult this movie is to anyone who watches it.

By the end of the film she has messed up everything with just about everyone and realizes that she has done so.  As she returns to current day London she realizes that she has learned a lot about herself and is able to do things she hadn't thought of doing before like getting rid of the dead beat boyfriend on her couch.  Best of all is Darcy who wins her heart!
The film was entertaining.  Was it a better than the real story of Pride and Prejudice? Definitely not. Was it a refreshing look at the Bennett family? No. I liked the original characters from Pride and Prejudice much better than in this film (though Wickhams character in this movie is much nicer than in Pride and Prejudice).  However, if you were to view this movie as a stand alone story and not constantly compare it to the book Pride and Prejudice, you will enjoy it.

The thing I found most disappointing (and revolting) is this idea that movie-makers seem to have that they must introduce sexual vulgarity in order to make a historical movie interesting. This movie reminded me a lot of the ""Mansfield Park"" movie (1999), which introduced slavery and rape--that's NOT in the book! In ""Lost in Austen"" I was disgusted when learning about Mr. Collins' habits. And when Jane starts to show partiality to him, I turned off the movie.
The other thing that was disappointing was the blind credulity of the Bennett family and others of Amanda's modern language, manners and clothing. Her modern clothes are ""otter-hunting"" garb?!?
Part of the appeal of the book, for me, was Elizabeth's ability to overcome the social blunders of her family and help Mr. Darcy to see her as she truly was. Amanda's crudeness should have had her shunned from good society of the Austen era.",1245974400,28,1147,4.8274111675126905

The main character, Amanda's behavior was shocking and awkward in a Regency England setting (like wearing the wrong clothes, swearing outloud, and predicting the future), but the staple Pride and Prejudice characters react right in character. They actually behave more like themselves than the original characters, if that's possible. At first Amanda's outbursts were startling, but after a while I enjoyed them. She said what any modern reader would say outloud as she read her favorite book.

Because I am an Austen fan, the twisting of the Pride and Prejudice love stories made me queasy and worried for the final outcome of my favorite characters. Would Darcy and Elizabeth still be able to fall in love? I kept wanting Amanda to go back to modern life and leave my characters alone, but yet, I couldn't stop watching.

When unlikely heroine Amanda Price switches places with her favorite heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, she falls into the middle of the novel, Pride and Prejudice. She starts at the beginning and does her best to keep the novel-come-to-life true to its form. But despite her best efforts, or maybe because of them, things go terribly, and usually hilariously wrong. I was laughing almost hysterically when her actions accidentally cause Jane to marry Mr. Collins, instead of Bingley.  I loved the fact that it was essentially Pride and Prejudice, yet I had no idea what would happen next or how it was going to end. It was like reading the book for the first time. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend this movie to fans of Jane Austen as well as non-fans. But fans would appreciate the humor better, as having a knowledge of the novel is, in my opinion essential to truly enjoying and appreciating this gem of a movie.",1245110400,,1010,4.706214689265536

3134842,1,B0014T7ETQ,"I will admit that the idea of a modern girl going back in time sounded like a great story line. But ""Lost in Austin"" re-writes the story of pride and prejudice is poorly done. It starts off great and it seems wonderful, but slowly the script becomes messy and the story line is messed up. I tried to think of ways to fix the script and came up with a few improvements, but in the end the story line is weak and not enjoyable. I hate to say this but it kind of ruined pride and prejudice for me. Overall it's an okay movie. I would not recommend it for pride and prejudice fans. It almost came off as a mockery of pride and prejudice. The acting is a bit over done, but believable. The costumes are well enough and the locations are beautiful. The lighting is okay it could have been better in a few scenes. The director did a great job with the camera angles and the editing is fast past. Overall, I think most people will be happy with this movie. I was hoping for a more gentle version, such as the girl that would go back in time would be of the gentle type and would fit in more naturally, but than we would lose the comedy. I do believe that some pride and prejudice fans will find this movie enjoyable. That is they will like the oddities the movie shows and the odd plots twist and turns. But in my opinion i thought the script predictable and a little vulgar. I'm not trying to hurt anyones feelings.  If i was the script writer; I would focus the story line to be more comical and romantic. That no matter what the character would not interferer with the story of Dacey and Lizzy, but would add to it, by falling in love with another character within the story that could be introduced as a brother or a friend for example the cousin of Mr. Darcey.

Please don't send me hate mail, because i didn't love this movie. I wanted to like it, but i couldn't because of how predictable it is. But I'm sure that many people will enjoy this movie sine it has a fun twist to it.

I would have to think that this was done to fit the entire series on one disk, but the makers should realize that if I am willing to commit 3 hours, I would  give up 3.5 to see all of it. Same with the cost, I would have paid a few extra dollars to have a second disk if needed.

Still I recommend it. Very cute rendition. My 9 year old sat through all 3 hours last night and at the end stated that she hoped they would make another!",1244678400,2,608,3.934959349593496
3134844,1,B0014T7ETQ,"Based on other reviews and the trailer, it appeared to be an affectionate modernizing of a beloved story.  Instead it was crass and crude and has little redeeming quality to it at all.  The ""heroine"" purports to adore Pride & Prejudice, and to have read it often, yet when she finds herself in that world, she makes it clear she learned nothing of manners and genteel behavior in all her readings of it.  She uncaringly bashes around making no effort not to shock or offend everyone around her as she heavy-handedly messes in everyone's lives without any thought to their feelings.

The plot is convoluted and several times things happen ""just because"" but for no logical reason in the course of the story.  (Granted Elliott Cowan is very handsome soaking wet in a clinging shirt but it made absolutely no sense for it to happen and certainly not for him to agree to it as Darcy.)

If you're absolutely desperate to see this, rent it.  Or better yet borrow it from some poor sap (like me) who actually bought it.  Mine?  It's going straight in the rubbish bin.  I'll certainly never give it a second viewing.",1244592000,28,1108,4.607142857142857

I guess a little fantasy such as enabling to enter into the core of those past times we all (Austen's lovers) once had while reading the novels. Because of this reason, I trully loved this movie and all the actors, who were so perfectly cast. My DVD-copy which I purchased from a diffrent web site than Amazon.com specifies on its backcover that it runs aprox. 3 hours. I was totally disappointed to find out that there are a several scenes missing (ex. ""Amanda's singing [Downtown!] in front of Darcy, Bingley and Caroline Bingley"", and ""Amanda is scoleded by Mrs. Bennet and ordered to leave her residence"", etc.) I'm wondering if any one can help me out to answer my inquiry: does the Amazon's DVD contain the entire movie scenes as it was broadcasted on TV Channels like (Ovation, PBS, MPTV,...), with no cuts whatsoever?

3134847,3,B0014T7ETQ,"Originally a 4-part British miniseries, Austen's timeless story is given a modern twist - Amanda Pryce, a modern day British woman is thrust into the mannerly world of the 18th century Bennett family, while just about every gentleman falls for her.  As she tries to return home (Elizabeth Bennett has taken her place in modern day London, which unfortunately is not explored), all the characters take paths not prescribed by Austen, much to Amanda's dismay, and it is up to her to right the wrongs.

While the plot is inventive and at first intriguing, it quickly gets old as the story drags on nearly 3 hours and starts to become redundant; it could have easily been trimmed by an hour and still told a compelling and entertaining story. The acting is outstanding, and Darcy is at his pompous best. The production values and cinematography are also first rate. A huge missed opportunity was not following Elizabeth's journey into the future filled with cars, televisions, mobile phones, and property rights for females. Definitely recommended for Austen fans.",1244592000,,1060,5.017045454545454
3134848,1,B0014T7ETQ,"This is truly one of the worst films I have ever tried to watch.  I left the room after the whole pubic hair incident and accusing Lydia of being a lesbian.  It was all absolutely unnecessary and ruined any chance of me finishing the movie.  I can accept bad acting and some liberties being taken to keep Jane Austen's work afresh today, but this was beyond a disgrace.  Trash like this movie makes me appreciate works devoid of modern filth used in order to attract a larger audience.  Sex has become a perversion and I am really outraged that anyone who has the power to give permission to Jane's work being used allowed her name and characters to be associated with this movie.  Nothing Jane Austen about it other than beloved characters being stripped down and degraded.  Words cannot begin to describe how awful this movie is.

Things to note with this edit:  1) It was Lydia and not Jane as I had incorrectly stated earlier that was in the bed.  2) I stand by my original review but will add that it was not only the missuse of Jane Austen's ORIGINAL work that ignited my dislike, but how uncomfortable I felt trying to watch it.

If you like silly, poorly scripted rip offs of popular characters and movies this is the film for you.  While the movie may be clever and original in taking a modern girl into the world of Jane Austen it lost all merit in not appreciating the world of Jane Austen.  Sure us modern folk would scoff and roll our eyes at men courting women and not jumping into bed with them, but some of us still like our women to be ladies.

This movie did not add up.  If the heroine had been thrown into the times not already knowing the novel then I could understand her crudeness and stupidity.  However she did and thus is subject to my scathing and unsymphathetic review.",1244332800,36,1797,4.416413373860182

Amanda Price, our heroine, longs for romance and the refined manners of Austen's era.  She knows all the characters of the book almost better than her own friends.  When Amanda finds herself trading places with Elizabeth Bennett the events of book start changing and Amanda works very hard to get the right couples together.  She keeps telling Darcy about Elizabeth (who is living in modern day England)and tries not to fall in love with him herself.  The characters are well developed and all the twists and turns make for a great story.  If you are a ""Pride & Prejudice"" fan you will love it, but it is also fun for those who don't have all the dialogue between Elizabeth and Darcy memorized.
It is pure delight and the extra footage on the making of the show is a great plus.

The only part I was disappointed in was when they cut out the scene where Jemima Rooper's character was singing ""Down Town"". I watched it online. On the DVD, the characters wanted to hear her sing and that next thing you know, there applauding and commenting on her singing, without her ever singing. I don't know if it was omitted because of copyright laws on the song or what. But it would have been nice to have left it in. Otherwise, I had no other complaints.",1243987200,,804,4.33112582781457

Amanda drops into the P&P story complete with the Bennet family and Bingley and Darcy. She is dismayed to discover that when she's entered into the mix instead of Elizabeth, nothing seems to be working out quite the way it does in the book. Because she knows the plot after having read it millions of times, she tries to fix things with disastrous results -- story lines get mixed up, people marry the wrong people, etc.
When Darcy turns out to be even more of a prig than she had imagined, she still can't stop herself from falling in love with him. There's a hilarious scene with Darcy emerging from a pond (at Amanda's request) with a wet shirt clinging to his chest that should make fans of the 1995 P&P movie giggle.
Another fun part of the story is how Elizabeth is taking to modern times complete with computer and iPod. After what she's seen, she has a hard time going back to her old life.

3134859,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I'm holding up my credentials to verify that I am an Austen-phile and a huge fan of Pride and Prejudice. I even found fun in the Bollywood version (""Bride and Prejudice"")! That said, I can state that this was a lovely twist on the classic novel, as well as an amusing take on what it means to be addicted to P&P, as so many of us are!

As Amanda's actions in old time England started to turn the standard plot on its ear, I found myself enjoying not so much the plot turns themselves as the take on each character. Those of us who have read the book many times and seen all the incarnations expect certain things of each character. It was fascinating to watch how they would react to new events (even though the characters were unaware of how things SHOULD have gone.) Like other reviewers, I don't want to give these twists away. Some played better than others, I suppose, but I'll bet all of us Austen fans will like different things - and different takes on character - from other Austen fans. Still, the acting was fine, the ladies were charming, the men suitably hot.

And speaking of us Austen fans, not only was it fun to put myself in Amanda's shoes (which would not fit me well), but I liked the amusing in-jokes aimed at Austen addicts. And if I'm including a little bit of a SPOILER here, the moment when Mr. Darcy jumped in the lake was delicious on many levels and showed us that the screenwriters were not only lovers of P&P, they possessed a devilish sense of humor. Post-modern indeed!

I recommend this one as a fine way to spend a rainy afternoon. It made me want to form a club: we read the book out loud together, then watch all the incarnations, one after another, fortifying ourselves with a feast fit for Bingley's table!",1243296000,3,1744,4.393188854489164

Amada continues to push the characters in the direction she knows they should be going, but alas, it isn't working. And that is the fun of the film.

Originally aired as a four-part series on BBC, the DVD combines all four parts into a very decent film. I did not see the original four parts, I cannot tell you if anything was cut, I can only say I found the film neither too long nor too short. I did find it very entertaining.

I would say the film would be better enjoyed if you have watched the excellent Colin Firth version within the last year or so. Or be very familiar with the tale.

3134869,5,B0014T7ETQ,"Hold on tight, this English mini-series walks a precarious line between being part very funny comedy, part drama, part romance, part fantasy in it's own right versus simply being outright offensive to Austenphiles and their beloved memories and characters.

The plot is fantastic: modern girl, Amanda Price, no apparent relation to Fanny, pines for genteel age of 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Mr. Darcy'.  Somehow, she exchanges places with a very willing, flesh and blood Elizabeth Bennet.  What ensues becomes total chaos and unpredictability as Amanda's wish disrupts all that is sacred in the Austen world, and try as may to fix it- it just gets worse.

How do the new characters compare?  The parents and the sisters are fine giving us more indepth details of who they truly are, Mr. Bennet- reasonable, Mama- unreasonable, a tigress for her family security.  Caroline Bingley(Christina Cole- soon to be in another English TV series-""Emma"".  Can you believe it!) is one of my favorites.  Of course, she's sharp tongue and brilliantly malevolent.  Mr. Collins probably the best Collins yet, more slimy and stupid; Wickham- handsome and really not what he seems; Lady Catherine(Lindsay Duran- remember her as Lady Burtram in 'Mansfield Park'-1999)stalwart as the grand matriarch.  And Darcy?  Elliot Cowan stays true to the misunderstood but noble hero's image. Tough boots to fill. My wife thinks he's great.  Must be.

Finally, the heroine(Jemima Rooper- don't know her- lots of TV work): to like or not to like?  That is the question.  She's no Elizabeth Bennet.  But she definitely says what's in her head whether she wants to or not.  She's awkward and out of place in both worlds, a bit obnoxious and uncouth.  She desperately wants to do the right thing.  Most of the time, she can't help herself let alone anyone else; lovesick and vulnerable, we couldn't help but root for her.

This miniseries is very well shot with all the beautiful trappings of locations and costumes and good actors.  Three hours long with a very good 40 minute ""making of"" segment in the special features.

Tried and true, stick to the story, Austen fans will probably be put off by the changes and the slight offensiveness.  But we laughed immensely. 'Lost in Austen' is it's own creation. Each episode is a surprise.  Where is this story going?  What unbelievable yet still somewhat reasonable actions do the characters intend to pull off?  How will they wrap this all up?

I'd give 4- 4 1/2 stars because I'm not very discerning at times about things of the heart, but this series has lots of heart and believe it or not, romance.  My Elizabeth says to give it 5.  Ok.",1242864000,4,2654,4.901123595505618

But she's about to get a rude awakening as one fateful evening, she is propelled into the scheming 19th century world of Pride and Prejudice while that book's Elizabeth Bennet is hurled into hers. As the book's familiar plot unfolds, Amanda triggers new romantic twists and turns within the Bennet family circle as she clumsily tries to help the sisters nab husbands and even captivates the tantalizing Mr. Darcy herself.

Of course my favourite rendition of Pride & Prejudice is the Colin Firth BBC-1, A&E version...But to be lost in the novel? And really, Ladies? Who does not want to see Darcy again in a wet shirt?

The main character was annoying to begin with and continued to worsen throughout the movie.  The soundtrack becomes burned on one's memory, with tendrils of smoke wafting through the air.  Many of the most witty lines are often rushed and mumbled so that you cannot understand them.  The plot was unbelievable and as the movie progressed, the characters would seemingly flip mid-stream as to their convictions.  My family and I all enjoy P&P and all of us feel betrayed by this farce.  We did find it rather fitting that the second portal between the two worlds happened to be a Port-a-Potty - and perhaps, this movie should remain there.
If you are to watch this ""spoof,"" please bear in mind that it is not like the original.  One of the lines uttered by Amanda Price is ""Jane Austen would be rolling over in her grave like a cat in a spin cycle,"" could not be more appropos.",1242518400,10,1233,4.459821428571429

Think Space Balls to Star Wars-Galaxy Quest to Star Trek, Blazing Saddles to westerns or Legally Blonde to all those pitiful jokes about  dumb blondes!

This is not to be taken seriously.

It had some very funny parts. Loved when Amanda tells Lydia ""not to get her hopes up"" about Mr. Collins! I just about rolled off the couch when she said that!

The only reason I give this story 4 stars instead of 5, is because Lizzy and Darcy were not together at the end as they should have been.",1242518400,,539,4.297029702970297

Jemima Rooper as Amanda has very funny lines and predicaments that she lands in that were extremely funny and from which she has to extricate herself with wit and hilarious results. She commands an excellent portrayal of her lovable character with candid comedic facial expressions that did me in. One must listen carefully to her 21st century mind trying to download into 19th century England. I loved the dialogue and particularly enjoyed Mr. Bennet's exasperated demeanor and humorous anecdotes about his life. All in all, the actors are all wonderful, and you will love Jemima Rooper's character.

For all that the main character was an Austen fan, she had little or no concept of how to handle herself in that time.  Her clothes were way off the hook and the families acceptance of some strange, oddly  dressed stranger just appearing was unbeleiveable.  Plus her hair bothered me.  I am sorry but young unmarried women in that time did not go about with their hair down!  I couldn't even watch the whole movie, just got p$^&ed off and advanced through the scene selections to the end.  Kind of a cool idea, lost a lot in the reality!",1241740800,5,693,4.444444444444445

I am also a huge fan of all the sequels that have come out about what happens after Elizabeth and Darcy wed.  With that said, I was honestly very excited when this movie came out to see what sort of variation this had taken on.  I really cannot express my level of disdain and discontentment when this movie ended.  I'm sorry, but changing the ending of Pride and Prejudice is unforgivable.  It wasn't the director or producers right to take away Elizabeth and Darcy's happy ending in favor of a stupid main character that the viewer wishes would disappear the entire movie.  Kudos to the supporting cast who did their best to act successfully around such a weak lead.  Please don't waste your time or energy (or money for that  matter) watching this video.  If you truly love Austen, pick up a copy of your favorite novel of hers instead.  It's time much better spent.",1241308800,12,1005,4.527777777777778
3134900,1,B0014T7ETQ,I can describe this movie in one word: Obscene. What began as a clever idea ended as a complete waste of time. A bitter and cynical take on most of our favorite characters and vulgar language makes this film anything but attractive. It was all in very poor taste and I think that Miss Austen really is rolling over in her grave at the preposterous antics of the writers. It drug on for three hours and yet the audience is left with little understanding of these new characters posing under familiar names.,1241308800,36,505,4.5
3134901,5,B0014T7ETQ,"If there is anyone out there who loves Pride and Prejudice that HASN'T dreamed of being Elizabeth Bennett and being magically transported into Jane Austen's classic novel, I would be greatly surprised.

This is the ultimate fantasy: girl hates her life, wishes for romance and adores Jane Austen, and somehow gets stuck in the novel herself. She is sucked into the daily life of the characters as they go through the events in the novel right from when Charles Bingly moved into Netherfield Park. Of course, this isn't real Austen. Our heroine does more damage than she intends, and Charles Bingly falls in love with her instead of Jane. Her actions totally throw the story of the novel out of sequence, leaving the audience to wonder how anything will ever be straightened out.

Ever since I first read Pride and Prejudice, I wished that I could be Elizabeth, and I thought of many different ways the novel could go. What if I could convince Mr. Collins to marry Mary Bennett? What if I managed to get Wickham to fall for Caroline Bingly? What if Charlotte Lucas married Colonel Fitzwilliam? There are so many different endings, and this is a wonderful way to imagine yourself in Elizabeth Bennett's shoes. I do hope they make more like this!

I am really surprised that so many people liked it.  It was terrible.  I rented it from Netflix because of the good reviews.  Where do I start with where it went wrong?  I don't mind if someone changes the story line a bit, but if it is supposed to be Austen's world, please, please retain the integrity, good character, wit and kindness of the main characters as well as the cultural norms of the time.  That is all lost.  Darcy is just plain mean.  Why Amanda likes her is a mystery.  Amanda is vulgar, unlikeable and a liar.  Why Darcy likes her is a mystery.  She also has this annoying habit of speaking in slang which must be used just in England, because I didn't understand some of the phrases she used.  I could tell enough by the context to know they weren't very nice.  Bingley is a drunk and unlikeable.  Georgiana is immoral.  Jane is weak, pathetic and willing to compromise her principles.  Elizabeth is absent.  Miss Bingley and Mr. Collins are changed from being just foolish and arrogant to being downright creepy and perverted. Ugh!  Can I say enough that it was terrible?  Can someone please take the charming idea of stepping back into Austen's world and retain the character, wit, likeability and kindness of the main characters?",1241049600,58,1382,4.586065573770492
3134903,3,B0014T7ETQ,"I REALLY, REALLY wanted to love this series. After reading other reviews I just knew I would because I generally love all things Austen and English. I wanted to love it so much that I bought the DVD from Amazon because it was a ""very long wait"" in my Netflix queue. However, I was a bit disappointed in the end. I understand that it takes a drastic turn from the Pride & Prejudice novel I know and love, but I totally get what it is trying to be. I just didn't find that I liked the main character or Mr. Darcy very much. I found humor in certain scenes (the wet shirt/lake scene was absolutely hilarious), but other scenes made me cringe a bit (the ""landing strip"" comment at the beginning for example). In general I feel that Lost in Austen is an interesting idea and look forward to another Lost in Austen which I hear is coming out in the next couple of years (hopefully Sense & Sensibility). However, I feel this particular series just didn't live up to my expectations and I doubt I will ever watch the DVD again.",1240790400,5,1019,4.3125

Going into details will give the whole story away, but if you are a true Austen fan (as I am), it's difficult to find anything to like in this movie.  The explanation for Amanda's presence/Elizabeth's disappearance is spurious, at best.  Mr. Darcy is borderline evil, and his and Amanda's attraction to each other is a complete mystery.  The only reason I gave it two stars is for the few humorous moments that can be found (for example, Amanda kneeing Mr. Collins in the groin - so satisfying!).  Other than that, it was way too long, and the point (if there even was one) was completely lost on me.  It's only redeeming feature is that it has served to remind me why I have consistently refused to read Austen sequels since that first horrible one many years ago.

3134906,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I love the books that continue Jane's stories, but this modern movie is a terrific idea. Elizabeth in present-day England is something I've never wondered about, but I have thought of all the women in love with Colin Firth/Darcy wanting to go back in time. To before-Netherfield Derbyshire. Our heroine Amanda from present-day London is one of these. There is a scene where she asks this Darcy to go in the pond and get his shirt wet..... well. Hot and hysterical. Amanda tries to direct all the Austen characters in the way the book would go, but you'll have to check out the results yourself. It wasn't just a happy romantic or funny movie, I also caught myself feeling anxious for the outcome of the movie. Thus it became even more enjoyable, with tension in the plot that makes it great.",1240617600,2,791,4.617021276595745
3134907,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I have watched this ""mini-series"" now 4 times since receiving the DVD from Amazon immediately after its release and each time the production gets better and more brilliant. Excepting the few tiresome references to today's world of PC the writing is brilliant and very Austen-esque in style and therefore very believable. The casting was great, Mr & Mrs Bennett, great and I would say, regarding the Bennett sisters, they are the best to date, e.g., Jane,  Lydia, Kitty and Mary and although ""Lizzie"" had a fairly small part she would have been a great Elizabeth in any of the past P&P productions. I would have to say that Mr. Collins' character was a bit over the top and his ""habit"" detracted from an excellent script. Wickham seemed to be much more spot on had a Lydia/Wickham relationship developed in this ""what-if"" production. Also, Lady KDB, Mr. Bingley, sister Caroline Bingley and Charlotte Lucas all very well cast.

Mr. Darcy might be construed by some who view this production as a bit too harsh, but his character seemed to be more ""in character"" for the ""landed aristocracy"" of the period of English history being depicted and true to the novel, softens as the romantic interest develops.

Amanda, simply a great casting choice and a brilliant and believable performance!! Hope to see Ms. Rooper again.

I will say that the premise of this mini-series could not have been pulled off in any less than the 3 hours the DVD runs. However, be forewarned that there is heavy, if not total use, of ""hand-Held"" cameras which produce an annoying and distracting bobbing and weaving effect of the filmed image. Also, a minimum 5.1 audio track would have been nice to have.

All in all this production is a very well executed and respectable ""what if"" adaptation of Jane Austen's most famous novel and well worth the price to add to anyone's Jane Austen video collection. I highly recommend this DVD.

Oh, I too am disappointed that the scene in which Amanda sings ""Downtown"" has been cut. That edit creates  a huge continuity issue due to the several references to Amanda's singing ability later in the movie. I can only believe that leaving the scene in the DVD would have served to renew interest in an old, somewhat forgotten song and consequently renewed sales. So, the deletion of the scene results in the score movie fans 0, music retailers 0, lawyers 0, a no win for all involved. Badly done, badly done!!",1240617600,5,2416,4.76555023923445

My biggest complaint is that one of the best scenes from the original television airing is not included on this dvd.  After dinner with Darcy, Bingley and Miss Bingley, Amanda is asked to entertain them by singing a song.  She sings ""Downtown"" and it is so hilarious.  I was really disappointed that it was taken out.  You can catch the deleted scene on YouTube.  But if you don't mind great liberties taken with the original P&P you will enjoy this.  Go into it knowing it's just for fun.",1240531200,4,635,4.469565217391304
3134910,5,B0014T7ETQ,"The movie is about this chic (Amanda) who is a huge Pride and Prejudice fan. One night while reading, she hears a sound in her bathroom, only to walk in and discover Lizzy Bennett standing in her shower! Lizzy explains she came through a door in the wall (One which was originally home to pipes and such) but when they open it this time, you see into the upstairs of Longbourne! Amanda wanders in out of curiosity, and the door shuts. She's trapped in P&P, and Lizzy is in her world.

Amanda quickly learns she's essentially landed in the beginning of Pride and Prejudice with the arrival of Mr. Bingley in town. Amanda introduces herself as a friend of Lizzy's, saying they did a swap and Lizzy is at her house. The family takes her in, and she accompanies them through all of the events of the story.

Amanda desperately tries to communicate with Lizzy to get the door back open (Which has sealed itself). Due to the lack of Lizzy, much of the story is being altered. Characters are falling for the wrong people, events are changing, and much more. Amanda makes and effort to influence the story to keep in on track with the writings of Jane Austen, but is overwhelmed by how badly the story has gone awry.

I won't give away anymore! I will say this though- I laughed A LOT, and I loved the movie as a whole! It was 3 hours long, but worth every minute. What P&P fan hasn't fantasized about actually meeting Mr. Darcy??? I wish... How awesome would it be to read oneself into our favorite stories? Too cool!",1240358400,2,1510,4.424460431654676
3134911,4,B0014T7ETQ,"I'm a huge P&P/Jane Austen fan, and I enjoyed how the movie (directed by Dan Zeff) changed much of the plot and dialogue while still capturing the period flavor and wit of P&P (on at least one occasion it also recalls ""Emma""). I'm sure many of the female fans love the Darcy character, and the ""Colin Firth wet puffy pirate shirt"" scene (okay, it's not a puffy pirate shirt, but close enough), but for me, the wit of the movie is the charm; it captures much of the spirit of P&P without copying it, so that I found myself laughing often throughout the movie.

One caution is that if you are not familiar with 18th/19th century British culture and the Austen canon, you may not appreciate some of the humor.

I assume anyone reading this review is probably familiar with one or more of the P&P's on DVD, but my favorite is the BBC version with David Rintoul and Elizabeth Garvie, my favorite Darcy and Lizzie. I also liked the Keira Knightley version (Keira Knightley is one of my favorite actresses), although the 5-hour Colin Firth version is objectively even better. Also highly recommended is Bride & Prejudice (with Aishwarya Rai), the Indian takeoff of P&P which should not be missed if you like a good, fun spectacle with great music and dancing. Surprisingly, the 1940 version of P&P with Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson is probably the weakest of the major movie versions, although it is still quite entertaining. If you have seen one or more of these movies, or read P&P the novel, it should greatly enhance your enjoyment of Lost in Austen.

And now, having written this review, I am quite at leisure.",1240272000,,1613,4.6328671328671325
3134912,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I ordered this with some hesitation as some of what has followed in the wake of the rising interest in all things Austen has been rather ugly.  I really enjoyed it though.  There was enough ""real"" Austen that you recognized the characters for who and what they were. Even when they deviated from the plot, it seemed to be quite in step with the way the characters had originally been written.  ****(spoiler alert) who couldn't believe it of Lizzie to want to head out on a big adventure in modern London ~ or that she would adapt very well once she found herself there?  To be honest, she was always way before her time in many ways.*****

Of course Darcy and Lizzy both were willing to do what ""duty"" called for -- but how much more fulfilling was the ending that was supplied.  There was also so much laughter and real affection between the characters (and who didn't love the water scene?)

I thought that this was just going to be my ""girl"" indulgence, but my husband and son actually joined me for the last two thirds of the movie and really liked it as well.  I am usually one who loves the idea of staying true to the book.  This is one of those examples that kept the spirit of the book - instead of the letter of the law (as it were.)

It was a wonderfully fun movie and I look forward to watching it again and again.",1240185600,3,1326,4.268
3134913,5,B0014T7ETQ,"This very modern spin on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is both brilliant and funny.  Jemima Rooper is a fiesty 21st century Austen fan who suddenly finds herself in the middle of her favorite novel. Her attempts to keep the plot of the novel on track are amusing and touching.  Elliot Cowan's Darcy seems a bit too stiff, even for Darcy. The supporting actors are all very good.  Much like Austen's own writing, the dialogue is fast and witty.

I am a long time Austen fan and love that this series does not hesitate to tweak and alter some of the core characters and events within the novel.  My favorite changes involve the ""truths"" about Wickham.  I've spoken to a few other Austen followers who don't like the liberties that ITV takes with characters and plot.  Some viewers might be shocked by an annuled marriage, references to lesbianism, and the radical alteration to the ending we've known and loved for two centuries.  I found the proposed annulment to be rather unbelievable, but I'm willing to suspend some reality in a movie that's already asked me to accept time travel into a fictional book.

I watched all four episodes straight through, and I'm going to buy the DVD.  If you're willing to watch some big changes to Austen's novel, I highly recommend this laugh-out-loud program.",1240185600,,1299,4.758928571428571

Austen purists may look down their nose at the film, but to the plain ole' Austen enthusiast it is simply another wonderful twist on the best possible story.

3134917,1,B0014T7ETQ,"Supposably an adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" with the insertion of a modern day character.  The modern woman through a fanciful plot twist has to substitute for Elizabeth Bennett.  This in its self could make an engaging alternative telling.  HOWEVER, this ploy is used to denigrate this classic novel.  The characters completely turn the plot on its head in an attempt to substitute late 20th Century liberal mores.  The movie has the modern character inform Mr. Bingley that Jane Bennett is a lesbian.  This completely ignores the perfectly valid customs and culture of the English country Folk of the early 1800s. It goes on to infuse Elizabeth Bennett with a modern ""career woman""  mentality. Even a cursory knowledge of Jane Austen's letters would refute the intentions sometimes ascribed by modern feminist Literature professors to this work.  Save your time and money, instead pick up A&E's ""Pride and Prejudice"". Better yet, savor once more Jane Austen's original novel.",1239840000,16,997,5.226415094339623
3134918,4,B0014T7ETQ,"Imagine that once upon a time in the early  21st century, a devout  ""Pride and Prejudice"" fanatic and unintentional time traveler named Amanda Price  wandered through the door behind her Hammersmith bathtub and switched places with Elizabeth Bennet, only to discover that most of the romantic principals in Austen's story were set on hooking themselves up with the wrong people.

Imagine, too, that while trying to fix this muddled mess, she inadvertently drove Bingley to drink, found herself engaged to Mr. Collins and just in the nick of time discovered a savior and ally in one of Austen's most despicable villains. Toss in assorted other wild and crazy contrivances, throw in a new variation on the famous Colin Firth wet shirt scene, cast the whole thing well nigh perfectly--with special  kudos for  Jemima Rooper as Amanda, Tom Riley as Wickham,  Lindsay Duncan as Lady Catherine, and Alex Kingston and Hugh Bonneville as the best pair of Bennet parents ever!--and wow!  What fun!

Warning: This wonderfully well imagined, over-the-top variation on one of literature's great classics  should not under any circumstances be critically compared with or considered a valid substitute for genuine Austen.  But for everyone who's ever fantasized about going back in time and grabbing Darcy for herself (which pretty much means all of us, right?) this is three hours not to be missed!

Kudos to the cast. Very well done. Mr. Darcy is just as smoldering and sexy as he was in the Colin Firth and Keira Knightley versions.

3134921,4,B0014T7ETQ,"I had no idea there was such a production until I stumbled on this show on Youtube of all places. Of course, the format was in parts, and so my viewing experience was quite choppy, but all the same I enjoyed it, and am definitely getting the DVD.

Austen purists will probably revile this witty adaptation/revision of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, but fans of Austen who aren't too particular and enjoy some liberties taken with Austen's works [in the interest of fun and entertainment] will find lots to enjoy in ITV's four-part series ""Lost in Austen"".

Jemima Rooper stars as Amanda Price, who is an avid fan of Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice and who yearns for the romance experienced by Darcy and Elizabeth. One day, she is flabbergasted to find Elizabeth Bennet[Gemma Arterton] herself facing her in her bathroom. Apparently, there is a 'magical' door through her bath wall that is able to transport Lizzie from Meryton to contemporary London. Before long, Amanda gleefully wanders through the portal into Lizzie's house with all its chaos, and life as Amanda knows it will never again be the same.

Amanda tries her best to get the other characters from P&P to follow through on the novel's plot, a situation made difficult by Lizzie's absence [glibly explained away as visiting Hammersmith, Amanda's home]. Mr Bingley in the meantime finds Amanda more interesting than Jane, and things get more complicated when Amanda meets Mr Darcy[a suitably brooding and haughty, yet drool-worthy Elliott Cowan]. Though Amanda finds Darcy interesting and attractive, his rudeness towards her is irksome, and the pair are soon engaged in witty verbal sparring.

The dialogue is part of what makes this production so entertaining. At one point, Jane is ill and ensconced in Bingley's country estate, and Darcy asks that Amanda leave. Bingley protests, saying 'She has paracetamols!' [paracetamol being the British equivalent of our Tylenol, or other fever-reducing medications]. There are lots of anachronisms in this series,which is to be expected given the two distinct time periods.

The cast is excellent - Alex Kingston [of ER] plays a very different Mrs Bennett, portraying a woman who has steely determination and can be downright nasty when she feels her interests threatened. Hugh Bonneville makes a livelier Mr Bennett than we are used to in the other adaptations. Guy Henry plays the greasy Mr Collins to a ""T"", and his performance actually made me shudder in revulsion. George Wickham's role here is quite surprising, with a twist in his story that was unexpected.

All in all, this is a fresh, revisionist approach to P&P, and though it does not follow the traditional plot of P&P, it is fun and entertaining, and with a mostly likable cast that carry this production through. Final verdict - fun and fresh, not to be taken too seriously.",1239062400,12,2853,5.021141649048626
3134922,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series, but its charms are probably best appreciated by Austen fans with a working knowledge of the Pride and Prejudice story. A lot of the fun of the series is seeing how the P & P plot is derailed when Elizabeth Bennett exits and modern-day Austen fan Amanda Price enters the 19th century world of Austen's novel. Although I am an ardent admirer of Colin Firth's Darcy, I think that Elliot Cowan acquits himself well in the role, and Jemima Rooper brings the right combination of insouciance and insecurity to her modern, fish-out-of-water heroine. At times, the execution is uneven. Amanda is often unnecessarily clumsy in her attempts to influence the other characters, and some of the resolutions seem contrived. Overall, though, I thought the series was ingenious and I was kept in suspense to the very end wondering how Amanda and Elizabeth would ""fix"" the perverted plot.",1238544000,6,905,4.9605263157894735

I can relate to Amanda when she says, ""every time I have been with someone, it was you (Darcy)..."" to paraphrase.  I know that I have longed for a modern man who could be more like Mr. Darcy, so I'm so glad that this was made.  If I can't find my own Mr. Darcy, at least I can revel in Amanda's escapades!

Mr. Cowan's performance as Mr. Darcy puts Mr. Firth's slightly wooden version to shame.  He has an exquisitely mobile face and piercing eyes, utilizing both to perfection when giving us a Mr. Darcy who is mannerly and elegant (that ""aristocratic languor"" Amanda speaks of) but inwardly passionate.  Sublime performance.  Very enjoyable and completely believable.

I, myself, am an anglophile and die-hard Austen fan, and I have to say that this one wasn't worth the time I spent watching it.  I can see by the reviews that many have liked it.  My disappointment could be that anything other than the original work is a poor substitute.  I thought the story line was lacking, unbelievable, and boring.  Simply put, I thought it was pretty stupid.  I watched it for about an hour or so, and then switched to the gameshow network.  Even THAT was better than sitting through this awful awful movie.  I give it 2 stars, because the actors seemed to be very talented.  It's too bad that they now have to be forever associated with this piece of work.",1236729600,7,748,4.36231884057971
3134927,3,B0014T7ETQ,"I heard about this show and watched it online (sidereel.com) expecting to hate it, but I must admit that it sucked me in and forced me to watch it! Was it the handsome Elliot Cowan sizzling around as Darcy, the spunky if misguided heroine, or the unpredictable plot twists caused by a modern Austen fan bumbling through the world she'd only dreamed of? I can't be sure, but I have to say that I couldn't wait to see where the story would go next. Is it ridiculous? Absolutely. Will you feel foolish trying to describe it to your seriously literary friends? Believe it. Will you be embarrassingly hooked on it and want to see it again? Maybe. Whenever I engaged my brain I felt like I was watching some pretty crazy fan fiction, but nonetheless watch it I did. While some may find it a hack job that butchers their favorite book, it seemed to me more of a musing on the idea of what would it REALLY be like to be in this world so many of us like to read about. I will admit I wasn't crazy about the ending, but I don't want to put up a spoiler. So my final analysis is that I didn't really admire it but I did enjoy watching it. UPDATE: I ordered the dvd from Amazon and am pleased with my purchase. I did find the dvd at a local bookstore, but the price was double Amazon's, so I recommend getting it here, folks. The dvd contained two extras: an interesting ""making of"" feature and a trailer. I did notice that the dvd version was edited differently than the version I saw on sidereel, namely the loss of a scene where the heroine sings the 60's pop song ""Downtown."" That was a bummer. I can't say what else may be different, but apparently this version isn't exactly the same as what was broadcast in the UK. That being said, it's a good buy for a fun movie that comes in at about 3 hours, so that's two movie nights at my house!

3134928,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I first started hearing about this at a favorite fanfiction sight.  I ended up buying a Region 2 DVD from England and buying a multi-region DVD player just to satiate my curiousity. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. The premise of modern day Pride&Prejudice fanatic, Amanda, finding herself swapping places with Elizabeth Bennet is right out of a sci-fi, paranormal flick-- but once the story gets rolling in Regency England, the pace is fast and one better not blink!  The quick, cheeky conversations, and the twists & turns far flung from Jane Austen's original are entertaining and LOL funny. Elliot Cowen as Mr Darcy is outstanding. I think Jane Austen herself would have cast him! He had just the right amount of haughtiness, pride, arrogance, disdain, and finally tenderness.  He gave me chills when he gave Amanda a proper set down at Netherfield; so believable. The escape from Austen's usual canon was surprisingly refreshing and the play with characters was delightful. If you are expecting Austen's masterpiece P&P, this is not it. However, my Austenite sensibilities were not in anyway offended by this blatant & somewhat contrived story. Not wanting to give anymore away, let's just say that the entire ensemble was perfectly cast. It is all done in good humour and very  tongue-in-cheek. But I must admit that had I been in Amanda's shoes, I am certain I would have behaved better! And yes, I'll probably pre-order the Region 1 DVD, too!",1234656000,195,1441,4.966804979253112

Just like I believe we can love the Colin P & P as well as the MacFadyen P & P, so too can we love this version.  We can love them all, as it is the story that we love, and these are merely different interpretations!  Jemima Rooper is a joy to behold; no one else could have pulled this tricky role off but her.  Please no one spoil the ending for those who have not seen it, but the ending to Lost in Austen is a big and wonderful surprise.  I personally would love to see a sequel in which we see how Lizzy is doing in her adventure.  Shh.  Don't give it away!!!  A delight.

One night, Elizabeth Bennet somehow ends up in the real world through a door in Amanda's bathroom. They switch places. On Amanda's end it seems in the beginning she's going mad and wants to leave. Yada yada yada, and Amanda brings chaos and change to the story. I loved it so much simply because what Austen fan wouldn't want to step into Pride and Prejudice, into Austen's world? It's funny, sweet, painful (Bingley and Janes) And lovely. Mr Collins is not as good as P&P but still is disgusting. I want to step into this novel and I think that if you'd like it as well, this is an interesting and great movie to watch. Darcy is obviously not Colin Firth Darcy, but he's still good. There are subtitles and behind the scenes with interviews with the actors. And let me get this out of the way, Lydia is FAR less annoying and so beautiful. I think they made a risk with this type of twist for P&P, but one that actually worked out. I love the intelligence, the writing is very good. Wickam is redeemed. The only thing I was iffy about was how it came to happen with Darcy's little sister Georgiana. She'd kept the truth a secret and first meeting Amanda she tells all? Hmmunbelievable to tell a stranger the great secret. Still it was very well done. It came on time and perfect condition.

A renduring of what happens when modern London-ite, Amanda Price trades places with 1800's Elilzabeth Bennet of Hertfordshire is a wonderful mangling of events and people. Everything goes sideways. A must watch for Janites!",1466812800,,289,5.444444444444445
3368725,1,B0014T7ETQ,"So disappointing...not that the directors and producers will care a wit about my opinion, since they've already made bank off this film. I love Jane Austen's novels, and I love many of the riffs on her work, and thought I'd enjoy this one, but at 3 hours it's way too long and at about the 3/4 mark I just had to start fast-forwarding to get through it to the end.

Miss Price, as she's called by the Austen-era characters, can't possibly have read ""Pride and Prejudice"" given that she doesn't appear to have the ability to edit her words or her actions as she rampages through the characters' world. She'd be considered an amazingly irritating loose-cannon of a houseguest even today. At one point she excuses something Darcy says when he appears briefly in the 21st century and comments on a bus passenger as ""Tourette's""; Miss Price herself appears to suffer from this condition throughout the entire movie.

The tone of the humor is set early on when she flashes the camera she thinks must be hidden in her Regency room. Austen's characters are twisted beyond all recognition. There are bits of sly humor--Darcy appearing in a white shirt in a pond at Miss Price's request is amusing--but I kept feeling the presence of a certain void, that somehow the writers were missing out on great opportunities. There just wasn't the deft touch that this sort of spin on Austen needs to make it one for the ages. I guess they just wanted one for the quick box-office revenue.

It was fun to see Hugh Bonneville as Mr. Bennett, though.",1466035200,2,1528,4.651851851851852

However, I took away one star in my rating and only have it a four for some of the language that was used. Jane Austen's work is honest and innocent and to mesh gritty and in seemingly words with her brilliance is almost sacrilegious.

HOWEVER, this movie wasn't good. The idea is good -- most women would love to step into a Jane Austen romance so I couldn't wait to watch it, but the main character Miss Price is obnoxious, annoying and unattractive (and not very smart), and Darcy is mean-spirited and rude, not romantic or inspiring and he never gets there. It's way too modern, with people sleeping around and other inappropriate, overly sexual topics that just veer too far from what makes Jane Austen stories great. It just takes it way too far and comes out crass too many times. For Jane Austen purists who love the romance/courtly love in the stories, this one misses the boat. I will never watch it again; bought it at a guy friend's recommendation. Instead, I highly recommend Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility (especially BBC version but also Kate Winslet version), Emma, Persuasion, Austenland, Miss Austen Regrets, etc.",1449360000,,1216,4.907766990291262

What ruined this production for me completely was the ending. Now, I don't consider myself a purist when it comes to Austen. I enjoy remakes and changes and even some sexy times when retelling Lizzy and Darcy's story, but in the end, that's what it should be: LIZZY AND DARCY'S STORY! And this is my biggest complaint, and the one I couldn't get past with this ""retelling"" of Pride & Prejudice: It's no longer Elizabeth and Fitzwilliam's story. Amanda is now the heroine, and while I understood and accepted this throughout most of the production and could even put up with Darcy TEMPORARILY falling in love with Amanda, in the end, I need Lizzy and Darcy to end up together. In that, I suppose I AM a purist. And a production or a book or any sort of media where Darcy and Lizzy don't end up together CANNOT EVER work for me.",1445904000,2,1236,4.622727272727273

Maybe Jane but if Amanda pursued Darcy Jane wouldn't be allowed to get marriage annulled. Even if she did, they had to run away to America.

3368824,3,B0014T7ETQ,"Hugh Bonneville of Downton Abbey and Notting Hill always worth watching even the case he makes in the bonus footage for this film's highly desirable vicarious premise & potential it fails to fulfill since the writers & casting agents didn't learn from Grimm's Cinderella and Austen's Mansfield Park to successfully merge social classes by having an inherited upper class elevate someone worthy from a lower class who though lacking social standing & resources is abundant in goodness of character, and in Cinderella's case--unlike Mansfield Park or Lost in Austen--also in beauty & grace.

Yes, Hugh, we understand this film was made to bridge Britain from when it was Great down to the level it has now sunk down to today, with England's uncouth youth ignorant of her once glorious acme of polite mannered Christian society instead glorifying this film's sordid heroine's crassness & promiscuity as engaging ingenuousness & earthy frankness though this Neanderthal-jawed, straw-haired, coarse heroine is not entertaining, and Austen would be mortified and saddened by the low level King Arthur's Camelot, ""this sceptred isle, this England,"" has eroded down to today--below see level.

Ironically throughout the film the characters say it for me: Mr. Darcy speaks of the ""sewers outside polite society"" whence both this actress & her character derive, rightly calling her an ""abomination"" (Bible Book of Ezekiel adjacent to ""polluted"" & ""profane"").  The Bennett siblings complain of the over-exaggeratedly ""repugnant"" ""grisly"" ""ghastly"" Mr. Collins portrayed more like a character from Austen's Northanger Abbey than a country parsonage in Pride & Prejudice.  Even the repellent low-class heroine says Jane Austen must be atwirlin' in her grave--but not because of the heroine's repellent intrusion into the most beloved Austen classic via a shower door failing to cleanse her from polluting Austen's world and my consciousness.

Other actors & the portions of the script befitting Austen as well as the visual historical recreations are so good I viewed the film again.  US TV ""ER"" Alex Kingston is too tanned, strong & menacing for haplessly harmless Mrs. Bennett, and Mr. Darcy pales in comparison to other incarnations; but Miss Jane Bennett & Lady Catherine de Burgh are the best I've ever seen, Mr. Bingley shows more spark of life than usual (notice he looks like Barry Manilow?), and Miss Jane Bingley & Mr. Wickham are more charming than usually portrayed, which better justifies their sway over others.

The disjointed & unengaging plot is difficult to follow & aggravated by filming inconsistencies like visibly cold breath in summer attire & sets, and men in long-sleeved shirts topped by vests & wool coats with women in short-sleeved muslins without so much as a scarf or shawl draped from their elbows.  The Britishness we seek in all things Austen is excessively diluted by other nationalities as Mr. Darcy notes.  I've realized the secret to enjoying this film is to ignore the lead character & her low-life modern friends as much as possible, and employ her trick of inserting oneself into the story instead! Ahhhhhhh. Now that's more like it ;)",1423958400,2,3163,5.222879684418146

Completely unlikeable characters except for the main character's best friend (who we see 3 times tops) and weirdly enough Elizabeth's mother, of all people (but she was!). At one point Mr Darcy (who is a complete snobbish classist PRICK in this and unattractive to boot) says he can't marry the main character because ""she's not a maiden"". Then five minutes later he decides to marry her after all and her lack of virginity is never brought up again. The plot doesn't make sense (and there are about a million different plots, all of them nonsensical), the characters and the way they behave doesn't make sense, the acting is AWFUL, the writing for the most part makes me cringe. The main character would have been locked into an asylum in less than a week with the way she acts in this. I *love* fanfiction,and I love fandom, so I don't understand why only the most s***ty fanfiction (and this is definitely self-insert Mary Sue stuff) is the stuff that gets attention from Hollywood or whatever England's equivalent would be.

3368867,5,B0014T7ETQ,"Lost in Austen originally aired as a miniseries in the UK. The series heroine, Amanda Price, is a P&P obsessed 20-something who discovers Elizabeth Bennet in her bathroom getting handsy with her underthings, fresh from a portal linking her world to Amanda's modern-day London flat. You'll have to suspend disbelief as Amanda chooses to step through the door, leaving Elizabeth in 21st century London as Amanda emerges into the Bennet house to take Elizabeth's place in the story, clad in pleather leggings and a tunic top. Initially excited to find herself right at the beginning of the novel, her beloved tale quickly begins to fall apart as she realizes her presence is skewing things in ways she can't control.

This version turns a LOT of the Austen canon on it's head, which I gather upset a lot of viewers when it first aired, but for some reason I loved it. The characters are introduced exactly as you'd expect them to be and then deviate in ways that, to me, feel organic. Some of them even serve to satisfy issues readers might have with the original characters. Bingley, in this version, is forced to deal with the consequences of his weak-minded foolishness. Darcy, in turn, gets a very satisfying comeuppance for his presumptuous meddling. It's honestly the sexiest Bingley's ever been (also helped by the fact that Bingley here is played by Tom Mison, now of Sleepy Hollow and your dreams). Jane, too, gets the chance to exhibit some strength after finding little reward in the virtue of obedience when it lands her in miserable circumstances that benefit everyone but herself. The result is actually a more satisfying love story between Jane and Bingley, with both of them really having to jump some hurdles to end up together, as opposed to the tepid B-pairing they formed in Austen's original novel.

George Wickham, too, gets a refreshingly redemptive story line as a bastard with a heart of gold. The only problem is that, as a result, he comes off better than Darcy, who never deviates from the book version and suffers because of it. With all the supporting characters suddenly so vibrantly fleshed-out, choosing to maintain Darcy's aloofness renders him less a romantic hero and more of a curmudgeonly turd. Still, I've seen this movie countless times and it's always charming, funny and enjoyable, so it's definitely on my list of favorite adaptions.",1415491200,7,2373,4.915211970074813

3368907,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I had such a good time watching and laughing with this movie. It was really cute. It is about a girl named Amanda who switches places with Elizabeth Bennet. It reminded me a little of Bridgette Jones 's Diary. I think it was because of the inner dialog and the humor was really similar. Amanda carries herself as a carefree character as Bridgette did too.

I was laughing so much during this movie with the modern thought pattern trying to convert into the time period. Amanda is a huge Jane Austen fan and lives, breaths and eats P&P. Then when she finds herself with all the characters struggles to keep up with the JA dialog. One of the best parts for me was when Bingley confesses feelings for Amanda and not wanting to interfere with one of her favorite stories lies and tells Bingley she likes women. The look on his face. I lost it. There's also a scene where Darcy confesses feelings for Amanda and she asks him to do something for her. The next thing you know he's standing in a pond with his white shirt clinging to his body. We all remember that part in the 1995 P&P. Too funny.

It is well worth the time and money as it is a lighthearted romantic comedy with a surprise ending that pleased me very much. We are all this Amanda Character in the story and if you watch it in that frame of mind it is so much more enjoyable. No one is as JA wrote them but we've already read her version it's always a good time to read or see another. For those who like JA authenticity you may not like this story. There are some off colored comments but nothing too strong. I also would recommend Austenland if you enjoy this.",1407715200,4,1621,4.294117647058823

It's the part were Amanda trys to play the piano after dinner for Mr. Darcy, Bingley and his sister. She doesn't know how to play the piano and ends up singning ""Downtown"" by Petula Clark.

However, if you're looking for the exact story, watch the Colin Firth BBC version. This is NOT Pride and Prejudice. This is what would happen if someone like me got transported into the book to take Elizabeth's place... the whole thing would get messed up. I found the story hilarious and wonderful. Is it a little melodramatic? Yes. However, the characters are fun, the story takes on a mind of its own and you find yourself loving these versions of Jane Austen's beloved characters.

3368960,1,B0014T7ETQ,"The only reason I can come up with for this ridiculous movie being made, is that the writers hate Pride & Prejudice and wanted to ruin every character in it. Well they did.

****SPOILERS****

-Elizabeth walks away from her family and doesn't care to show up when Jane gets married, and even at the fact of her father near death she cares more about turning off appliances.
-Jane marries Mr. Collins.
-Charlotte goes to Africa alone as a missionary.
-Mr. Bingley is distraught at Jane getting married so he becomes a drunk, runs off with Kitty, and almost kills Mr. Bennett.
-Caroline is gay.
-Georgiana is a liar who threw herself at Wickham, and was rejected.
-Mr. Wickham is a good guy.
**-And finally, the worst of them all was Mr. Darcy. He is NOTHING like Austen's Mr. Darcy, and if he was, he wouldn't have fallen for someone like Amanda (main character). She is crude and ridiculous. For claiming to love the world presented in P&P, along with knowing the book line by line, she doesn't even try to fit in. And when she does finally try, she is still horrible at it. There was nothing funny or likable about her to me.

Amanda Price is funny, Elliot Cowan is wonderful as Mr. Darcy very handsome and believable in the part. Because you have to look under all make up to see that Mr. Darcy is very handsome. I like how the story makes Darcy Amanda's. Lost In Austen is very sweet and well written. There were a few things that Amanda's says that I wish the writers would have left out but only small changes.

Then it's like a dream.  You know the kind where you're doing everything wrong!  Because face it no matter how much you read about genteel society, it's just not hardwired into the reaction part of our brain.  So her witty banter invariably includes a few modern English swear words; when walking in a beautiful gown, she not only fails to float but plods around more like a plow horse.  Meanwhile, she's enamored and frustrated with the time period and people's pride and prejudices.

The gemische is spiced up with symbolism, twisted plot lines, and unexpected character developments eg perversions in Zeal of the Lord Collins, the generous honorable side of womanizer Wickham, sneaky 15 year old Georgiana, the perceptive Lady Catherine de Bourgh. And new characters born of Elizabeth's comment ""I may be fortunate enough to meet another Mr Collins!"" All the characters are richly women and more three dimensional than the 1995 version&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice-The-Special-Edition-A-E-Miniseries/dp/B00005MP58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E Miniseries)</a>&nbsp;with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth which is referenced repeatedly throughout the movie.

Familiar speeches from Austen books and movies weave sparkles into the appreciation for this farce.

Some viewers could not believe that Amanda Price could be an Austen fan and yet not fit into the Georgian period more smoothly. I enjoy reading Asian novels, however the reality of living in ryokan finds my tatami cluttered with suitcases, clothes, toiletry paraphernalia, my voice unacceptably loud, grammar not predictably gracious enough, clothes not appropriately combined and draped, my legs too stiff for sitting without central heat or central plumbing. It takes a while to fit in, and adapt to the lack of toileting and bathing facilities, the bias against women speaking, and unfamiliarity of finding oneself in another culture. Amanda Price took a while to find her feet in Georgian England as well given her upbringing in Hammersmith, a formerly industrial region, and her spunk.

5 star enjoyable romp. I compiled the following list to help with comprehension.

3369005,1,B0014T7ETQ,"Not only is it clear that the screenwriter has no understanding of the difference between Elizabethan and Regency English dialogue, but it's also clear that everyone involved in this production (except maybe Morven Christie) holds Austen fans in extreme contempt.",1383696000,3,263,5.6
3369006,1,B0014T7ETQ,"No really, I don't. I completely fail to understand how this managed to get a 4-star rating. It wasn't funny. It wasn't witty. It wasn't even written or performed particularly well. The premise had promise, but I just can't seem to wrap my head around where it went from there. In all honesty, it came off like bad fan fiction. *Really* bad fan fiction. It's not like I went into this expecting to watch another version of ""Pride and Prejudice;"" I expected things to get mixed up and crazy, for Amanda to be a total fish out of water and for hilarity to ensue. I suppose I can even understand her completely mucking the 19th century manners up ... or at least I could have if she hadn't claimed to have had most of the book memorized. If you've really read a book that many times, you'd at least have some vague idea of how to comport yourself in the world of said book, right? I mean, unless you're a total idiot... like Amanda. The girl didn't even try. Anyway, it was a mess. The ""heroine"" has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and neither does her supposed love interest. The only bit of charm in this whole debacle was a few of Elizabeth's scenes in modern times; she managed her time-swap much better than Amanda, and frankly I'd rather have watched a show about Elizabeth Bennet making her way as a nanny in modern London than what I actually sat through.",1383609600,15,1363,4.456
3369007,5,B0014T7ETQ,"Elliot Cowan makes the best Darcy since Colin Firth.  I never thought I'd find another actor who could ""be"" Darcy.  The story is fun and witty with enough inside jokes for those who have seen every TV/movie adaption of the book.  Hugh Bonneville gives Mr. Bennet just the right amount of sardonic wit and Alex Kingston has just the right amount of irritation in the role of Mrs. Bennet.  This story will never replace the original, but it is thoroughly enjoyable.  I am giving a copy to my daughter, who also loves P & P.",1383609600,,521,4.442105263157894

For my older, very proper Aunt's, there is only ONE comment that is made that is crude, but it flies by & they never noticed. It is a great movie, well done with fantastic sets & cinematography.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, though in order to fully appreciate it you have to have seen one of the movies based more on the book - otherwise you won't understand what's going on & get a lot of the humorous situations.  Still, if you haven't seen the movies based on the book (I like Keira Knightley's movie because of the locations used, and it's only 2 hours.)  Anyway, I highly recommend adding this movie to your collection. =)",1381622400,,724,4.421052631578948

3369024,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I rarely review what so many others have, but ""Lost in Austen"" has to be an exception.  Not realizing it had begun as a television series,  I was surprised how long the DVD played, but I was mesmerized until far into the night.  Others have commented on the superb casting and fast-moving pace.  This is not just another chick flick!

The idea of some kind of portal inside a home, leading to another world, is not a new theme.  The young people's ""Twitches"" films, earlier though far less significant,  used the portal theme to good effect.  Finding a secret door leading to another reality is the fantasy of many children, though most surely don't expect to look for it in a bathroom!

Neither is the concept of jumping into a book unique, not so much the fantasy of children, but of avid-reading adults.  Jasper Fforde has a well-written, entertaining novel series beginning with ""The Eyre Affair,""  based on a British government literary detective who jumps in and out of a variety of classic novels, occasionally including those of Austen.  While we get a brief glimpse of classic novel settings and wonderful characters in these literary excursions, the main focus remains Fforde's protagonist and her goal of solving a mystery or bringing back her ""eradicated"" husband. In ""Lost in Austen,"" the classic novel is the central reality.

The magic of ""Lost in Austen"" is ""Pride and Prejudice"" itself, and the desire so many of us have to experience more of it, lamenting that Austen's life was rather brief, only enough time to create a handful of superb novels.  Protagonist Amanda is perfectly representative of those of us who have read and reread, watched and re-watched all that has been published or presented, thirsting for more.  THIS IS MORE!

There is a certain frustration for those of us who are sure the plot of Austen cannot be altered.  Amanda herself suffers just such emotion, creating a tension that is both upsetting and intriguing, as she tries to force each character to do the right thing.  How could we as viewers not expect that when a writer inserts a modern character into an antique setting (as in ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"") the potential is created for something original, quite different than Austen herself envisioned?  Because it is Jane Austen's enduring masterpiece, we all know what characters are like, who marries whom, and how it ends...Or do we?  Watch this with all your preconceived notions, as well as with an open heart.",1379030400,,2485,4.85748218527316

But I rented from my library and I didn't think I would like it and my sister thought it would not be any good either. We first watched Pride and Prejudice and then we watched Lost in Austen. I tell you truly this was not only funny, but not to funny that it becomes ridiculous.

Some parts made you cry, like Pride & Prejudice and Darcy is just as much pompus which we all love. Mr. Collins is a little bit weirder and pretentious as ever. BUY IT TODAY WITH NO REGRETS.",1377388800,,844,4.017857142857143

This is the best Lady Catherine of the four movie versions of this story that I've seen, with an intensity that shines from the screen.  A very fine addition to the venerable works of Jane Austen that should be enjoyable for a wide audience.

If that's true, she appeared dreadfully uninformed about how to behave after entering the 19th century. Her constant fumbling and screwing things up was beyond ridiculous, and her crass crudity was just wrong. She was a stupid and witless character with a bucket-mouth. Her crudity and stupidity was no doubt gratuitously done, given modern audiences and films, but to do this with Pride and Prejudice? It isn't even worthy of being called a joke, much less a fantasy.

3369058,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I'm a dyed in the wool, bonafide Jane Austen fan and don't typically enjoy contemporary spins on the classics. BUT THIS MOVIE is as genuine to the Austen spirit (as can be expected if a woman from the 21st Century were truly portaged back in time) and found herself amidst the more genteel customs and lack of modern convenience.

Jemima Rooper plays it believably and all I can say is I hope the writers, producers & players are willing to go the distance and bring all the other titles to life! Alex Kingston does a marvelous portrayal of Mrs Bennet and the writers give an insight and depth to her dire position of mother to five girls that allows for her overwhelming emotionalism. Don't get me wrong, she's a basket-case but we've all known a few of those and obviously so did Miss Austen! Hugh Bonneville's character, Mr Bennet, is even more delightful and witty but the biggest surprise in madcap is Wickham! Here we find a plausible extension to his fiber (both moral and/or otherwise) that rounds out his personality. I found it hard to believe that a young man so evil could have gained the trust of old Mr Darcy (being that readers are led to believe that he is so discerning) and wise a judge of character.

Contemporary viewers may think of Regecy life as a slower pace but Jane Austen moves plots along like a freight train and this movie keeps up the pace. All in all- a delightful romp that I love to surprise and share with my friends who need a good diversion from our reality and technology.",1367712000,,1510,4.507299270072993

The cast of characters are BRITISH PERFECT, when it comes to producing something equivalent to Downton Abbey, but here, they are all inversted into to Austin's greatest work. Reading Pride and Prejudice beforehand is an absolute necessity, as the dialogue is extracted, twisted and repackaged in this funny and beautifully realistic depiction of Austen's novel of early 19th century English gentry.  OK, you can get away with NOT READING, but to see how the script writers have cleverly reshaped the characters and even extracted dialogue from Austen's other works is truly an added delight.  Amanda Price is our 21st century ""Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.""  She is also independent, very sharp (like Elizabeth Bennett) and comes into the story at the very beginning. Her opportunity to be IN her favorite novel early on in the plot is so much the adventure of a lifetime.  Little does she realize the equally frightening potential to screw everything up!

So when I saw Lost in Austen on Netflix a few years ago I was completely skeptical and a little afraid of what I was about to watch.  Turns out my fear was for nothing!  What a little gem of a movie this was and I enjoyed it so much I watched it a few more times before I canceled my Netflix subscription.  So of course when I saw it for sale here on Amazon I had to get it!

I'm sure there are plenty of synopis's here in the review section so I won't bore anyone with another, suffice to say all of the main characters were a joy to watch and while the focus is on Amanda Price and Mr. Darcy (both exceptional, I really enjoyed them together), I was most drawn to Jane and Mr. Bingley.  The pain, torture and longing between the two was played by way of both actors that you really felt the emotions.  I feel its always a sign of a great movie or book when you can really ""feel"" what the characters are feeling.

Worth watching if anyone likes Jane Austen!",1362873600,,1116,4.110599078341014

3369072,1,B0014T7ETQ,"Like many others, I was interested in the concept of the switch between a modern day girl and Elizabeth Bennet. This could be interesting! But...

It was a disappointment. SPOILERS below.

I didn't like how the movie played out. It sends out the wrong message: If you hate your real life love life--maybe a magic door will appear and you'll nab the fictional man of your dreams while ruining everyone else's life in the process. Forget about your real life and just abandon that guy who wants to marry you in the real world!

I didn't find the Amanda Price character to be likeable at all. I can understand how her presence can alter events but it didn't explain why all the characters were making out-of-character choices. I don't understand what was so appealing about her and why every character was falling in love with her.

Lastly, If you love the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth, then don't watch this movie. It's nonexistent here.

The only thing I liked about this movie and why I gave it 1 star was Tom Mison as Charles Bingley. Adorable. :)",1362096000,11,1060,4.647058823529412

3369076,3,B0014T7ETQ,"By now, you know the premise of Lost in Austen. On many levels it works excellently and on some it...just doesn't and those bad moments take away from the picture on a whole. (Spoilers ahead)

THE GOOD

1. The casting is excellent.
Jemima Rooper and Elliot Cowan bring serious sizzle to their roles of Amanda Price and Mr. Darcy, respectively. I love spunky, emotional Amanda, who tries her best to stay close to the premise of P&P, but mucks up everything. At first, I didn't warm to Cowan (too much squinting and glowering I felt at first) but the repressed passion and UST he delivers is ridiculously off the charts. Consider the scene where he tells Amanda she repels him. On one level, everything he says is correct, but on another, she clearly affects him in a way he finds most uncomfortable and that feeling repels him even as it attracts him to her (parsonage scene). Lovely bit of acting in both parts. The wet shirt scene is drool, freeze-frame worthy, I mean seriously, the man is gorgeous!!!! Alex Kingston shines as the motherly but ditzy Mrs. Bennet, while the others bring alive what I've always considered to be two-dimensional characters, in particular Morven Christie (Jane Bennet) andTom Mison as Mr. Bingley (more on them below)

2. Plot twists are unconventional, but work (for the most part)
The Jane and Charles twist was excellent! I've always thought of Jane and Bingley in the original P&P as plot devices rather than fully fleshed out characters. Here, it's a delight to see two essentially weak people having to come to terms with hard life choices. Excellent acting, so much so, it almost stole the screen time of the two main characters, Amanda and Darcy. The Wickham/Georgiana reveal was nicely played as well. Again Wickham/Georgiana more of a plot device in the original text, but here there are many shades of grey. Love it!

3. The little LOLs count
Amanda furiously brushing her teeth on her return to her time. That's exactly what I would've done. Mrs. Bennet sinking into a deep curtsy for Mr. Darcy at Pemberly, so deep it was as if she was greeting royalty. Mr. Bennet examining what looked suspiciously like a marijuana leaf. Amanda singing Downtown and Darcy's smirk of reluctant appreciation; Amanda's post-modern moment :) I know and concur!

There's much more I can say, but I have to get to...

THE NOT SO GOOD

1. The ending.
While I wanted Amanda to have her happy moment and the love of her life, I mean it's canon. Darcy and Elizabeth belong together, fullstop the end. It was a risky ploy having her end up with Darcy, and I actually would have preferred her to love and lose Darcy (in that time I mean) and have her go back to her time and meet her own Darcy (a descendant of the original delicious Darcy).

2. Mr. Bennet
The actor was fine, but the character was written as a little too easygoing. He just trusts Amanda because Lizzy says so? No concern over his favourite daughter going off apparently in the middle of the night to Hammersmith? Brushing off Mrs. Bennet actual legitimate concerns? Nah.

3. Caroline's reveal
Well played by the actresses, but a little too soapy for me. No thanks.

4. The pacing between Amanda and Darcy
He hated her, apologised for being wrong, confessed his love rather quickly after that, and then withdrew it after finding out Amanda wasn't a virgin, proposed to Caroline, followed Amanda to the future, said he loved her again, then decided to try with Lizzy, then back to Amanda. Phew, it was too much back and forward and I blame the writers here. Overly complicating things just made it more difficult to understand exactly how, why and when he had fallen in love with her, even to follow her to another time.

5. The comment about negroes on the bus. That was just really awkward. We know he was from a different time but there were many other ways that could have been shown.

All in all, it's worth it to watch it over and over again, as I have, and it's a good show, just not worth 5 stars.",1360627200,2,3990,4.61212976022567

Since it was a mini-series, it is several hours long, but it is enjoyable. If you like Austen adaptations like Bridget Jones or Austenland, British actors, and yummy Elliot Cowan, you might like it.

THIS IS NOT ""PRIDE AND PREJUDICE"", but a commentary on how sometimes ""the grass is greener on the other side of the fence"". The foundational point of this storyline is simple and well taken, the story is interesting and tolerably well acted, I rooted for the characters, and found the ending to be satisfactory for this ""alternate reality"" tale.

The writer(s) of LOST IN AUSTEN are not trying to do a modernized remake of Jane Austen's beloved story, but are instead, pointing out the irony of how multitudes of modern women are in love with Austen's period tales of romance, when Jane herself, hated the suffocating constraints that were placed upon women in the society of her day. These very novels that have captivated women of today were actually a scream of frustration from a woman who would have dearly loved to find a door to the freedom that comes along with living in our modern times. In her novels, Jane Austen was able to become mistress of the fortunes of her heroines, but Austen's personal stark reality was that she was stuck in a cultural trap from which she never escaped. Some of today's women may well wish they could escape the harsh realities of our life and times, but the Regency era was rife with problems of it's own and freedom was reserved for only a privledged few women who were lucky enough to ""catch the right husband"". It could be argued that the fantasy world of Jane-mania is foolish, and that most of us wouldn't like it if we could actually go to Jane's world and cope with the situations we would find ourselves in.

To make it tolerable for Amanda Price, a few unrealistic concessions to the ""Modern"" outlook had to be incorporated into the story. I will not spoil it by telling what these concessions are, but will only warn you that if you watch this movie hoping for another remake of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, you will be sorely disappointed - just be prepared to enter into a story where everything is changed from the novel that you love. This was very thought provoking to me and I think it reminds us that we don't know what we are craving when we wish for a different reality than has been given us.

BOTTOM LINE????  I love Jane Austen stories and have read/watched each one many times over.  Just like Amanda Price, they are always new to me.  These stories never get old and I am sure that there will always be days when nothing but a ""True Jane"" will do.  While LOST IN AUSTEN is very watchable and I liked it for a one time fling, it will never be in the same class as a real Jane Austen.  Once was enough, and I doubt if I will ever watch it again.  The true test of a really REALLY great story is when you still love it after years and years of re-reads.  I cannot say that about LOST IN AUSTEN, or about any other Jane Austen fan fiction I have ever encountered.  There is simply nothing like a ""True Jane"".",1356220800,,3228,4.454237288135594

Mr and Mrs Bennett are played as well as they were in the supreme 1980 version; here they are not clownish, yet still funny.  A very good balance of the real and the fantasy story. I think a viewer MUST be pretty familiar with the printed novel and at least one of the previous films, to get the best out of this.  It is long --- three hours? --- and the very end seems a little drawn out, but I was enchanted all the way through. Jemima Rooper pulls off the difficult task of fitting in to the early 1800's without either clashing or making fun of it; a very believable performance.  A lot of time and money and preparation must have gone into this excellent production.  You will not be disappointed --- but make sure you are familiar with the story first!",1355270400,,844,4.24375

3369108,1,B0014T7ETQ,"I am all astonishment at the positive reviews of this dreadful mess. The plot has been described, so I will only say I was intrigued by the idea and went in with a positive attitude. Alas, hope died quickly. I could go with Amanda and Lizzie switching places via some rip in the fabric of time located in Amanda's bathroom wall, although it's not one of the more elegant time travel scenarios.  But would the Bennetts have demonstrated such a complete lack of concern upon discovering that Lizzie had run off to stay at the home of people who were complete strangers to them?  NO. They would have been horrified! Did she have a suitable chaperone? Were her hosts respectable? But they just accept it and welcome into their lives Lizzie's oddly-dressed new friend, Amanda. Being a huge fan of the manners of Austen's time, Amanda naturally tries to fit in by smoking, getting drunk, and lunging at Bingley to kiss him - with tongue. Yes, this is SO Austen-esque.  Later, for reasons too ridiculous to explain, she tells Bingley she's a lesbian. Then she becomes engaged to Mr. Collins. Help us all.  Then Collins breaks it off with HER  (reflect on that for a minute - I mean how big of a loser would you have to be to get Mr. Collins to dump you?) at the Netherfield ball, after hearing a rumor that she is the daughter of a fishmonger. Amanda responds to his rejection by kneeing him in the crotch, which gets her kicked out of the ball in disgrace by Mr. Darcy. If any of this somehow sounds like it might be funny, I must disillusion you. It's all squirmingly uncomfortable and idiotic. I threw in the towel when Darcy declared his mad love for Amanda. This was a howler, as it made no sense even in the context of this stupid movie. Just a few scenes earlier, he told her she was ""an abomination"" - ouch! - but then, with hardly any additional interaction between them, he is supposed to be so besotted that he overlooks the minor quibbles that she is the  hard-drinking, bi-sexual daughter of a fishmonger.

None of the characters seemed charming or to have that spark of life to them that makes us enjoy all the characters of Pride and Prejudice even while knowing all of their faults. Besides, if at the end of the movie you like Wickham more then Mr. Darcy...something is deeply wrong. Seriously, I questioned my nature as a female when I had this epiphany. Amanda is...I don't know, a bit clumsy and bland; and I think I have enough respect for us women that most of us who have read Pride and Prejudice would have done better then her in this situation.

Character isn't remotely convincing as someone who has read P&P but perhaps merely watched movie versions.  The only bright woman in this story is the one who wisely escapes most of it.  Messed up on some of the details of the period which would have helped to make it believable but perhaps only Austen fans will notice. Don't expect Austen style wit and subtlety--this is like a period situation comedy. Three stars is a fair rating for this.",1347148800,,756,4.7846153846153845
3369116,2,B0014T7ETQ,"Let me start off by saying I've never read Pride and Prejudice, nor really any literature written around this time. A travesty, I know, but the point is that the only exposure I've had to this world is one of the movie adaptions. I loved it, and so when I heard that there was a miniseries out about a modern girl switching places with Elizabeth, I was really excited to watch it. Obviously with a plot like this, things were not going to go the way of Austen's novel at all, but I was okay with that and prepared for it.

Now, I'm not a purist of any fandom. I like different adaptions, theories behind a characters ""real"" motives, whatever (heck, bring on the fanfiction even). So I'll say that I'm okay with changing things--to a point. What Lost in Austen did to the characters in this world is just reprehensible. I understand that the world had to be expanded and different scenes would occur because of the main character, Amanda's, presence, but some of it was just so entirely unbelievable that I found myself actually getting angry. Some of these characters--which, I admit, I myself don't know very well--just seemed to be so far off from what I remembered them being, and even what they started off as in the beginning of the series!

I think my biggest problem by far was the main character. I could not relate to her in ANY way other than the fact that I, too, would love to be transported into the world of my favorite book. She was rude, crass, refused for the longest time to try to fit in to the world around her, and bumbled around throughout the course of the series making everything and everyone around her infinitely more miserable. I know why she loved Darcy--she'd already decided she loved him from the start, despite hours of complaining about how awful he was--but I have absolutely NO idea why Darcy loved her. It honestly seemed to come out of nowhere and felt really forced.

Mr. Darcy was horribly cruel and stubborn, Amanda was vulgar and intent on doing the exact opposite of what was considered ""proper"", Bingley was pathetic, and every other character just completely unrecognizable after awhile. Amanda literally made everyone's life worse until--magically--everything was fixed right at the end to give that happy ending. The show was painful, uncomfortable, and tiresome. I gave it two stars because there were a few redeeming scenes and laughs, and the acting was actually fairly good. It was a really intriguing, wonderful idea, but the execution was just awful. Perhaps this is a bit harsh, but I was so excited to watch this and ended up only being frustrated and bitterly disappointed.",1347062400,8,2629,4.698481561822126

The premise is weird, it follows Amanda Price a sweet modern woman who loves ""Pride and Prejudice"". Then one day in her bathroom she discovers Elizabeth Bennet. At first Amanda thinks it's a dream, but soon Elizabeth shows Amanda a door in her bathroom that leads to that other world set 200 years ago.

Amanda steps inside, directly into the hall of the Bennet house, when suddenly the door connecting the two worlds closes shut. So she is stuck in the world of Elizabeth Bennet.

What I liked about this series are the unexpected twists. I liked how all the characters grew throughout the story. I really liked Mr. Wickham in this version. I loved Mr Darcy as he grew throughout the series, he was also the handsomest Darcy I have seen yet. I liked how most of the characters got their HEA by learning to follow their heart, and to shed unfair prejudices and rules. I was glad that Amanda Price got her happy ending too, I was rooting for her. Last but not least, I enjoyed the comedic approach.

The one drawback is that the ending felt rushed. They should have added a scene with a montage showing snippets of everyone's life, after they ended up with who they wanted. I also wished they had given Mr. Wickham a love interest.

This girl, Amanda Price, gets thrown back in time to this story and ends up messing everything up. Instead of Charlotte ending up with Collins, she goes to Africa and Mr. Bingley at first ends up falling for her instead of Jane! Much hilarity ensues when she wildly professes she can't be with him because she likes girls, after being backed into a corner by him. The plot has many twists and turns and is quite believable as to what might actually happen if someone from this time got plopped into the middle of a Jane Austen book.

3369126,5,B0014T7ETQ,"Count me as a big fan of this series even though I regard Jane Austin's own writing as a boring or worse. One of my worst remembrances of college English, in fact, was being forced to write an essay, through gritted teeth, on Pride and Prejudice.  However, I have to say that Austen's stories make very good movies or, as in this instance, tv series.  The producers have managed to remain true to the spirit of Austen's story while adding the novel twist of a modern London girl being transported back to Austen's era. Wisely the story does not dwell on the time travel aspect,and does not become a science fiction tale.  There is just a simple door in a bathroom wall through which the modern heroine goes back in time while Elizabeth Bennett enters contemporary England. It then closes, locks and plays very little role thereafter.  Virtually all of the story takes place in the earlier era with only a small segment where the heroine and some of the Austen characters end up in contemporary London. Probably the most surprising aspect of this story is that it is exceedingly funny and I for one don't laugh easily. Very few things make me laugh out loud but this story often had me laughing to the point of tears. Because this is based on tv series I had expected to watch this over a number of days, Instead my family and I sat and watched it from start to finish, all three hours in one sitting.

3369130,5,B0014T7ETQ,"The first time I watched this it didn't quite compute.  A friend gave me the DVD, I'd heard nothing about it, and was non-plussed that it was seemingly such a departure from the original P&P.  Odd, since I'm a fan of both Austen's and time travel stories.  But there's a lot to digest, a LOT going on.

After watching it several times, my admiration has grown exponentially.  The dialogue is marvelous, the language sublime- that's what's most noteworthy, in my estimation.  I loved the language so much I watched it one time through with English captions on, so I wouldn't miss a syllable.

The characters are fully fleshed out [with one exception, below], their actions in keeping with the original, yet they grow, develop, partly as a result of their contact with 21st century Miss Price, partly as a result of the absence of Lizzie.  We come to know them much better.  They're funny, wry, clever- all perfectly in character- phenomenal.

ALL the actors are wonderful.  I especially liked the characterizations of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Wickham, & Mr. Bingley- their development, the greater understanding we gain of them.  For me, this definitely rounds out, deepens, the P&P experience.

Only a few small quibbles do I have (SPOILER ALERT- DON'T READ AHEAD IF YOU WANT TO BE SURPRISED).  I'm no prude (for example, thought the ""landing patch"" bit funny), but I thought the sniffing fingers business was gross, repulsive- moreover, a distraction, because in every subsequent scene with Mr. Collins you're waiting to see if he does it or not, rather than attending to the dialogue and his wonderful acting.  Annoying.

Secondly, although the story is jam-packed, Darcy doesn't have enough to do, as compared to the original.  He mostly just looks stern and dubious, one eyebrow arched.  We don't see much of an evolution over time, as we did with Colin Firth's Darcy- wrestling with his emotions, taking action to correct things, etc.  [Granted, many of Firth's actions occurred off-camera, but we learn of them- in subsequent viewings we know what he's up to, been up to.  This Darcy does a lot less in front of the camera, AND behind the scenes.]  His softening/metamorphosis comes almost entirely at the end, with little precedent (or build-up of dramatic tension, I thought).

There could've been dynamite scenes in which Darcy learns the truth about Wickham, or, spearheads the effort to rescue Lydia, or, orchestrates the Collins's anullment.  The script neglects him, or renders him incidental in many scenes (perhaps some scenes ended up on the cutting-room floor).  The focus was on Miss Price, and I think the plot would've been better served, the end even more satisfying had Darcy played a more active role throughout, would have provided greater justification for her falling head over heels in love with him.  Indeed, Mr. Wickham's character was much better developed, it wouldn't have surprised me if she'd fallen for him.

I have other small gripes, such as the fact that she's a smoker, has only one cigarette left, takes one puff and then tosses it away (would never happen), and noted several missteps in the plot (they could've expanded on Darcy's experience in modern day London, for example, or could've had Mr. Bingley and Lydia go off in search of Utopia instead of for an apparent tryst), but oh well.  The missing Downtown scene, though brief, was endearing and humanizing, softened her brashness, too bad it was left out.

But, these are relatively minor gripes.  The music was great, the lighting and sets gorgeous, the acting uniformly superb.  And kudos to the lead actress- she got it just right- perfectly natural, never a false note, at first like a bull in a china-shop, but gradually becoming more at home in her surroundings, more attuned to others (and 18th century sensibilities), more in love, more luminous.

I have no idea why they did it, but they cut out some scenes from the original tv release.

It was a great scene and shouldn't have been cut! If it was due to space limits, I'd rather they cut some of the behind the scenes or here's an idea, add a second disc.",1328054400,2,841,4.191358024691358

3369139,1,B0014T7ETQ,"I'm of the belief that great literary characters should not be ripped apart.  Why Darcy would ever fall in love with this crude girl is beyond me.  Elizabeth is one of my favorite characters, and she's nearly completely absent.  Amanda DID NOT make up for her absence.  This could have been a good movie if Amanda spent her time trying to get the book back on track rather than falling in love with Darcy herself.  I think it's ridiculous that every man that comes into contact with Amanda instantly falls under her spell even though she's everything men of that period would dislike and disapprove of.  I thought Mr. Darcy of all men would have better sense. I believe in creativity, but I also believe in characters remaining true to their original character, and the characters in this movie do not.  I did not cheer when Lizzie stayed in the future, and Amanda stayed with Darcy.  It was a big disappointment.  Also, it's bizarre that Lydia is the youngest yet looks older than all the sister put together.  Basically, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.  Just stay with the original Pride & Prejudice.  It's MUCH, MUCH better!",1324252800,12,1138,4.691919191919192
3369140,3,B0014T7ETQ,"An entertaining, if slightly improbable story, that centers on a young women's obsession with Jane Austen's book characters. This movie is best suited for those who have actually read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice or seen one of the movies based on it. While the actors did a good job in their roles, the storyline was a bit far-fetched and hard to follow at times, even for an Austen enthusiast. A definite plus was the beautiful countryside where the movie was filmed.",1324252800,2,474,4.7926829268292686
3369141,5,B0014T7ETQ,"You can't take this movie too seriously, especially if you take P&P seriously. Having said that this movie does not trash or disrespect P&P in any way. The central theme of the movie is preserving something that has already been errecably changed, and imagining hiden depths to all the characters, which doesn;t at all slight JA in her own characterisation, but makes the watcher realize that everyone that Miss Austen created can be looked at a little differntly.

The basic premis has been discussed, and having seen clips focusing on the potential of a romance between Amanda the heroine and Darcy, I was of course skeptical that I would like this movie. First the only way that a romance could work is if the romance that we all love, Elizabeth and Darcy is destroyed, second I don't really want to spend three hours getting involved with a love story just to see it fall apart, so it's no win, they get together and you've just ruined one couple, they stay apart and you've just waisted your time. I spend most of the begining of the movie worrying about this, until I realized that without the romance the movie was fun and thoughtful. I got to see the train of events we all know get derailed, and watch Amanda try to put them together.

I won't give the ending away, but I will say it was satisfying. This movie is really something that all P&P fans can appreciate, I doubt if non P&P fans will find as much funny about this movie, nor will they appreciate the charcter shifts. My favorite scene in the movie is when the Benetts are rescued by non other than George Wickham, and the dashing charming Captian is set down right away by Amanda who isn;t going to have any of his charm. In fact the Wickham storyline is many ways the highlight.",1323043200,,1748,4.511041009463723
3369142,5,B0014T7ETQ,"As soon as I saw this when it first came out on tv about 3 years ago, I instantly fell in love with it.

Yes, I know it had swearing, smoking and some other things like that, but It's not meant to be a a classic and classy Jane Austen story because it's a MODERN Jane Austen comedy and SUPPOSED to be set in today's world mixed in with the Jane Austen era. Of course it's going to be crazy and the casting not all that fantastic. They deliberately intended with this as it's not meant to be a 'serious' drama, so of course the actors will be made to act not as professionally as they usually would.

I thought it was funny, romantic and very well made. 'Amanda' is not exactly your standard Jane Austen film 'pretty girl' with manners, she is an ordinary girl who swears and seems a bit of a dreamer which made it more likable as she was realistic, and not this gorgeous and perfect girl. It was hilarious seeing the reactions of her going into the 'Jane Austen' world with her modern clothes, modern language and appearance!

I also liked how the other characters looked more as they would've looked back in Jane Austen's time, not just with clothing, but in appearance as they looked quite 'natural' and not with so much make-up on as other films. In other Jane Austen films, the girls are always stunningly beautiful girls, nice to see a difference in this film, same with the men.",1322956800,3,1384,4.377431906614786

I am, however, inordinately diverted by the antic caperings of the haters. After you've read a couple, you can almost recite the next one on autopilot. Miss Price being repeatedly slated as being vulgar is particularly mystifying. She was just normal. Anyone would think a chavvy ladette had rushed the stage clutching a half-empty bottle of cider...

I also have a particularly soft spot for those who miss the point completely. Bless.

This was an excellent, witty take on P & P. All the right elements were there, and all the right references even to the Firth / Ehle BBC version (a rival network, at that). The music was spot on. Also, if you are a Brit, there was the extra amazement factor of ITV, of all things uncorking something with anything resembling class. A rare thing indeed.

The acting was all top drawer with everyone stealing scenes all over the place. Hugh Bonneville was especially larcenous.

The scripting and delivery of the language also worked well. Everyone has seen the BBC one and you could feel instantly at ease with the rhythm and vocabulary. It worked because it was instantly understandable, and you felt it was authentic. (Well BBC authentic... That's all that matters.) If they had fouled the script up, then the whole thing would have just collapsed in a heap.

I can do no more than recommend this unreservedly. If you do end up hating it, you were probably predisposed to doing so, in which case why did you bother? If you objected to them playing ducks and drakes with the plot, I think you were probably aiming to buy the real thing, and picked up the wrong DVD box.",1319414400,9,1807,4.596273291925466

Having read literally every novel that Jane Austen wrote, I wasn't amused by the idea of this story being butchered for the modern-day viewer. Having said this, I was so pleasantly surprised. It is hilarious! As mentioned by other reviewers, the end does sort of fizzle out in a lame way, but in general I was surprisingly satisfied with the tone of the movie. I didn't find it at all disrespectful to the original literature, it's just innocent speculation on whether or not finding yourself in your ideal fantasy world would indeed be ideal. I would definitely recommend it, though I must say that you probably won't fully appreciate the jokes and characters if you're not really familiar with the novel.

I actually enjoyed this movie, because it was not another person's rendition of the Austen's classic, it was an original comedic change from the normal Austen. A modern day girl sent through time...but sent inside of a novel! What I enjoyed most was the continuous unexpected moments and humor. See what would happen if the characters switched partners, or someones real character were made known! Some areas that weren't in the book are in here. Some areas from the book are in here.

3369151,4,B0014T7ETQ,"Very compelling story and often funny - quite unpredictable as well.  I found myself caring about what would happen to the characters, especially poor Jane.

I liked Amanda at first.  I liked her love for Pride and Prejudice, and her longing for a world of manners and true love.  However, when she actually was given the chance to enter that world, she repeatedly showed herself to be unworthy of it.  She is crude, she gets drunk at a party, and she teaches Lydia bad things.  She had once professed to know and love the world of the Austens, but when she doesn't get her way in the matter of marriage she presumes to lecture a heartbroken Darcy about the lack of ""emotional integrity"" she sees in the Regency culture.  Very offensive.  Clearly she doesn't belong in his world.  She should have gone back where she came from once she had brought Lizzie back to her rightful time.",1316304000,,881,4.560509554140127

3369153,4,B0014T7ETQ,"I had read the negative reviews of this movie and watched it seeking out things that would irritate me. Did I find them? Yes, but I feel they were inconsequential as I was caught up in the story right from the start and ended up liking the movie! It seems those who hated this movie just didn't get it. It's not purported to be an adaptation of P and P, it's the story of Amanda's fantasy of being plunged into the book and the plot twists and characterizations are all her doing. Contrary to what some thought, it seemed to me that Amanda did a good job adapting to her environment. Sure she reverted to 21st century expression at times, but think about it: She lived 20-some years in the modern world and like 5 minutes in the 19th century. Who could possibly achieve a complete character overhaul instantly? As for the twisting of the original story of Pride and Prejudice, I found it intriguing. Why not take all of those characters and say, What If? How might they have behaved under different circumstances? Again, while you may not agree with the directions they went, this is how Amanda crafted it in her fantasy world. Personally I thought the snobby haughty rude character being outed as a closet lesbian was hilarious. One thing that did bug me was the absence of Bingley's other sister and her husband. I know they were not critical to the storyline, but considering that Amanda claims to have read the book over and over till it was almost a part of her, you would think there would be at least a mention of 2 characters who were present in many scenes of the original book. All in all, I think the folks who hated this movie have got some prejudice of their own to examine. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The reason it only deserves 4 stars is that it's a bit long to sit through and because there are little annoyances throughout, but overall it's good entertainment. Just keep your mind open!",1315958400,,1902,4.484149855907781
3369154,3,B0014T7ETQ,"The premise of this was a fun one.  Too bad they pretty much screwed it up.  First off it was extremely difficult to have an empathy for the lead actress and her character.  As other reviewers said, if she liked the era so much in the book why didn't she try to adapt more. And personally I found her uninteresting and crude.  I couldn't believe she was really an Austen fan.  The rest of the plots were either silly or made no sense.  Yes she would have some affect on the characters but I found it very hard to believe they would accept her and her appearance so easily.  The other actors/actresses were okay, even though their characters' personalties were changed from the book.  I'm not going into plot details, you can read othe reviews that have done good jobs of that.

All that said, the only good thing about this mess was Elliot Cowan as Darcy.  He had the perfect arrogant good looks and that passion just beneath the surface.  And he's a hunk.  His personal emotional versus rational inner fight was portrayed perfectly.  So many of the Darcy actors either over-do one or the other.  I gave it 3 stars for the attempt and for Cowan.

 I watched it and copied it on cable.  But I pretty much only watch the last half over again.  I would never buy it.",1315699200,6,1263,4.370689655172414
3369155,2,B0014T7ETQ,"Well.  It has been said, but I will agree with the other haters: poor execution of a good idea.  The fatal flaw is, sadly, the main character.  I have nothing against the actress, but the character is totally unlike-able, uncouth, dirty-mouthed, and stupid. The accent alone would probably get her shunned in Austen society, let alone the AWFUL HAIR that I wanted to fix the entire series.  She also wanders around without a bonnet throughout - totally unacceptable, and as others noted, kind of odd for a supposed Austen devotee. (and I guess she packed a flat-iron). I suppose the idea was that someone casually tuning in, with no particular knowledge of Austen, can see that she ""doesn't belong"".  Well that kind of visual cue is unnecessary for probably 90% of the audience and does irreparable damage to the whole premise, if we are actually to believe that a modern person is inhabiting a lifelike version of Regency England.

I did like some character alterations (Wickham's character), although some (like toning down Mrs Bennet's neuroticism) seem possibly due to just being lazy/not understanding the original.

Outside of the main character, I thought all the characters were exceptionally well-cast.  To bad it was wasted on the poor script.

Oh, and the ending was execrable.  I can see why Elizabeth wants to stay in the 2000s, but I can't see either the attraction of Darcy or his for Amanda, and it reveals that this movie (as probably should not have been in doubt) is about as intelligent as your average chick-flick providing wish-fulfilment for the masses.",1314489600,6,1576,4.9356060606060606

Jane marries Mr. Collins!!!!!

Elizabeth stays in the future!!!!

I am totally grateful to be absolutely FREE of any and all tendency to compare this movie with the original novel and be disappointed as a result. The original Austen novel serves as fodder.

Think of it this way: Amanda is thrust ""back in time"" to a FICTIONAL WORLD: in other words, a world that simply never existed except in her own mind! What makes the movie so enjoyable is that it is truly Amanda's story and not some crappy thing being shoehorned into Austen's original work. The revelations are about Amanda, how she thinks, how she reacts, how she adapts. It is not about Pride and Prejudice any more. Suspend your disbelief and be Amanda for a short while.

As for wishing you could see Amanda bumbling around in a story that more closely resembled Pride and Prejudice, gosh, I would not wish that on the most forgiving of Austen fans. It is much more fun to watch Amanda struggle in a ""fictional reality"" that does not at all resemble her expectations.

Austen makes Henry Tilney say in Northanger Abbey that a novel is ""only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the best-chosen language."" For Austen, that meant one thing. For this movie, it means something entirely different, and as far as I am concerned, they succeeded quite well in that quality that matters most in a movie: it entertained me.

Yes. I expected to dislike the movie. But I liked it quite a lot.",1302998400,6,1587,4.613475177304965

There are no words to describe how horrible this was. If I want to read about some random OC hooking up with Darcy than I can read some crappy fanfiction and only wasted five maybe ten minutes of my life. I also hate the absolute assumption that any woman who stand up to Mr. Darcy and speak back is instantly going to win his heart. It's distasteful and a major slap to Jane Austen's work. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth had a connection and it has been that connection that has inspired and awed millions. It's disrespectful and completely horrible. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone and I would warn them ahead of time before they watched it. It was worse than the third Harry Potter which was a complete disaster.

3369174,1,B0014T7ETQ,"I suppose there IS a sort of Austen reader (or at least Austen movie fan) who's in love with the costumes, and attracted by the personalities of the characters - but who really thinks that the Regency era would be much improved by a shrill, vulgar modern harpy, bossing everyone around, and that Austen novels ought to have included bitter hostility towards the Church, and a bit of lesbianism for good measure.  This movie is for that person.

It is possible to do lighthearted, very funny parody while retaining affection and respect for the source material; indeed, with the wonderful job the BBC has done with various adaptation of Austen works, that's the tone I expected. Ironically, the protagonist of this work is a young modern lady who uses Austen for escapism - but, when ""lost in"" the world of Austen's characters, does her best to re-make her surroundings in the image of her own pointless and vulgar twenty-first century life.

Individual scenes are somewhat amusing, but not often enough to redeem the short-sighted, mean-spirited arrogance of the work as a whole.  Buy this as a gift for your own favorite vulgar harpy - then ask yourself why you HAVE a favorite vulgar harpy at all.",1301097600,16,1199,4.805825242718447

I must say that it was cool seeing Elizabeth Bennet with short hair and wearing modern day clothing, not to forget seeing Darcy in present day London as well. If your a Jane Austen fan like I am, then for sure you will enjoy this film with big twist from the orginal Pride and Prejudice.",1300406400,,740,4.21830985915493
3369177,3,B0014T7ETQ,"This movie/miniseries could've been good in so many ways.  The concept is intriguing; after all, what Jane Austen fan would NOT like to be magically transported into one of the greatest love stories of the era?!  There are a lot of positives going for this:  many of the characters have been wonderfully cast (this is my favorite Mr. Wickham & Mr. Bingley by far!), the settings are lovely, the costumes are exquisite, Mr. Darcy smolders just as he should.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of negatives as well:
1. Mr. Darcy --as wonderfully disdainful and moody as he is-- wears on his face the most comical look of disapproval for most of the movie.  Uncock that eyebrow a wee bit, won't ya?  It makes you look silly.
2. Amanda Price...oh dear, where do I start?!  Even I --an uncouth and unrefined American-- would've been able to bluff my way around Jane Austen's England better than this character!  She's crass, she stands there with mouth gaping open for most of the movie.  I agree with previous complaints:  for someone who'd been well-versed in ""Pride & Prejudice"" since she was 12 years old, Amanda Price should've just KNOWN BETTER!  She sounds like a blithering idiot for most of the time.  She lies and manipulates; she says and does the most ridiculous, cringe-worthy things!
3. Given #2, how is it comprehensible that Mr. Darcy would fall in love with Miss Price?  It's just silly! There is nothing redeemable in her character, except that she is obviously fond of the Bennett's.  She shows no great substance in the movie, nothing that sets her apart as decent or worthy of his affection.  Just baffling.
4.  Elizabeth Bennett--what the what?!  How on earth, since we know the great affection with which she holds her sister Jane and father, can she so suddenly and completely abandon them?  Does not compute.

So there are obviously some flaws in the portrayals of the characters, though not (in my opinion) as many as some reviews would have you to believe.  I was entertained by the further delving into some aspects that Jane Austen never touched (Mr. Collins brothers, LOL!, Lady Catherine de Bourgh as an ally, Miss Bingley's secret, hehe).  These do not fit with the *original*...but I don't feel they do much harm to the integrity of the classic.  Artistic license and pretty funny, at that.

Overall, the movie is entertaining, but not one that I think I can watch over and over (after the first time through, I had to fast-forward through all of Miss Price's social blunders and verbal diarrhea to make it tolerable.)  But...Mr. Darcy (as portrayed here) is smoldering and moody and very, very engaging to watch!",1300147200,3,2638,4.785398230088496

It is total fantasy to think that a modern woman could actually find herself in the Pride and Prejudice story, and that is part of what makes it so much fun.

I know she had an image the producers wanted but it didn't work for me. I loved the other characters and the plot, but not sure about the ending.",1298937600,4,435,4.443037974683544
3369182,5,B0014T7ETQ,"Expectation is everything.  The Buddhists remind us that there is danger in attachment, and so it is with this film.  If you are too strongly attached to one set of ideas regarding Pride and Prejudice, then this film is not for you.  To completely enjoy all it has to offer one must be willing to abandon prefigured expectation.

I have been an ardent student and fan of Jane Austen for just over fifty years now and this experience has given me my own set of ideas.  My first encounter with Jane was in a book, not on the screen.  In fact there was only one film of a Jane Austen novel way back then, and that original version of Pride and Prejudice was much more Hollywood than Jane Austen.  If you wanted to read a book you had to have a book, not an e-reader.  Letters were written on paper and went snail mail, and there were no mobile phones or portable computers.  A lot has changed in fifty years, so we must be mindful of the change that has occurred in two-hundred years.  This change is part of the fun of Lost in Austen.

As a rule I don't care at all for the current industry of producing Jane Austen ""sequels"" although not for the most obvious reason.  Jane Austen has taught me to look for more than just a story when I read any novel.  Most of the ""sequels"" are thin and do little more than attempt to capitalize on the perceived ""romance"" in the original novels.

Lost in Austen is not a ""sequel"" nor is it a parody.  It strikes me as being occasionally satirical, but of a certain set of Jane Austen fans, not of Jane's work.  I think we have a mistaken idea of who Jane Austen was, and that largely from the picture her family took great pains to shape for us.  If one reads the six major biographies and the remaining letters (most of the letters were likely destroyed by her family) a fuller picture of Jane emerges.  Jane was not an uptight, isolated, old spinster as has been suggested.  Were Jane to step into our world, she would likely adapt every bit as well as Lost in Austen's Lizzy Bennet does.  It is easier to adapt to a barrage of ""new"" things than it is to tolerate a lack of ""old"" things we have come to take for granted.  This is one of the messages of the film.

It is my firm belief that Jane would seriously enjoy this film once she had adapted to our time and its oddities.  Certainly Amanda Price is profane and crude, as are we all compared to the people of Jane's world.  That is one of the points of the film.  The original novel is often very biting in its criticism, always ironic, occasionally satirical, frequently funny, but rarely romantic.  The other films try to sell us romance, and the better ones also present us with Jane's detail allowing us to see contrasts, folly and conceit.

I think some folks object to this film because of multiple factors.  Perhaps they misunderstand Jane.  It seems clear they misunderstand the novels.  They forget that Jane wrote novels not scripture and was hopeful of making money at it.  And finally I think the complainers misunderstand this film.  It does not poke fun at Jane or her novel.  It does clearly poke fun at us, and attempts to remind us all that we should not take her work too seriously after all.  For any who know the novel well, there are many plays in the film on events or dialogue in the book.

I highly recommend this film, and do agree that a refresher viewing of the 1995 Colin Firth film is essential as is a thorough understanding of the novel to the greatest enjoyment of it.  Just remember, Coleridge's ""willing suspension of disbelief"" is also quite helpful to the maximum enjoyment of Lost in Austen.  As a note, I have noticed on IMDB that there seems to be another Lost in Austen in the works for this year.  It will be interesting to see what they do with a second one.",1298332800,5,3791,4.347578347578348
3369183,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I LOVE this movie!  I know the whole time-travel, enter-into-your-favorite-book fantasy thing has been done over and over again, but I love it anyway!",1298332800,,150,5.25
3369184,4,B0014T7ETQ,"Okay, when I first watched this film, I have to be honest: the Austenite in me was absolutely horrified and hated it! But, like a horrible automobile accident, I couldn't stop watching it. And, at the conclusion, I realized that somewhere along the journey in this convoluted,  mixed-up Austen fantasy world, I fell in love with ""Lost in Austen""! Now, I laugh out loud at the things our modern day heroine, Amanda Price, goes through in Austenland, and the modern twists she brings to this familiar story are hilarous!

My tip: make SURE to pause the movie right before Caroline Bingley asks Amanda to sing, then pull up any You-tube video that shows the next, missing scene: Amanda singing ""Downtown"". HILARIOUS! I think I watched that scene 50 times. Then, go back to the film. I think they couldn't procure the rights to the song for the DVD, so they had to cut that scene... but it NEEDS to be in the story. Watching Darcy's face while she is singing is priceless.

So, in short: throw aside all your Pride & Prejudice expectations or Austenite prudishness and simply enjoy this funny film for what it is. Is it perfect? No. But it's very enjoyable. And, like if you, too, like Elizabeth Bennet, ""dearly love a laugh"" and delight ""in any thing ridiculous"", you will enjoy this film!",1298246400,,1286,4.656387665198238
3369185,3,B0014T7ETQ,"I'm a die hard Austen fan, so I was really excited when I heard about this BBC series. Watched it, and really enjoyed parts of it. But, there are parts that I REALLY hate, too. The pop culture references are really amusing (wet shirt Darcy...'nough said). However, I really, really didn't care for the lead actor and actress. They didn't sell their performances very well. Here and there I was pleased with them, but over all Darcy was not just proud but he was angry and grumpy or something and Amanda was just not very likable. A major draw for the novel is that Elizabeth is very likable to the reader--the reader relates to and connects with Elizabeth. That is not AT ALL the case with Amanda. I think if they had picked a different lead actress, I would have liked the character more. Also, I was not expecting the ending. I'll not say anything more because I don't want to spoil anything for those who have not watched it, but the ending threw me off.
All in all, this movie just rubs me the wrong way, and no true Austen P&P fan will like this for more than a couple of viewings--just for the novelty of it. Watch it once so you can say you saw it, laugh at the funny bits, and then pass it along to someone else.",1297900800,,1220,4.285714285714286

- Elizabeth Bennet: ""My dear Miss Price, may I be so bold as to inquire: How fares your disposition in Longbourn?""

- Amanda Price: ""Oh, Miss Bennet, I'm afraid I've made an absolute cockup of things. I have upset the apple cart. If only I hadn't met you in my loo that night and gone thru that damned magical door!""

- Elizabeth: ""But, Miss Price, I had thought this your fondest prospect, to escape the ennui of your modern-day existence and so inhabit that of your most beloved book.""

- Amanda: ""Bob's your uncle, Lizzie. May I call you Lizzie? Too soon? Okay. To answer, Miss Bennet, I very much fear I shan't ever get the hang of it, living in the Georgian era, talking couth, behaving with grace and decorum. I'm all out of sorts, y'see, and color me envious. I see you, on the other hand, have adapted quite well to my 21st Century. I've always reckoned you were a girl ahead of her time, Miss Bennet, and I was right. Cor, is that your mobile?""

- Elizabeth: ""I confess I exceedingly favor your London and its remarkable advances, Miss Price. And, yes, this is indeed my mobile. Kindly pardon me as I perform a rash of these text messages. There, a round of LOLs to all. And yet believe me when I say, Miss Price, that you retain my utmost attention with regards to your unfortunate plight. Pray, say on.""

- Amanda: ""Well, I've well and truly bollocksed it up, y'see. It's smack-dabbed in the middle of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice I've landed in, except that the plot's now gone completely off the rails, and it's all to do with my crass blunders and cluelessness and lack of proper elocution. The other night, Mr. Bingley, in avowing Mr. Darcy's utter disdain for dancing, stated that ""Mr Darcy regards all forms of sudden locomotion as a mark of ill breeding."" Oh, the wonderful language. I am rendered awestruck at the ease with which elegantly couched diction trips off these characters' tongues. It's bloody brilliant. I've read Pride & Prejudice so many times, I thought I'd fit in quite seamlessly. It turns out, I'm completely at sea, Miss Bennet, with your era two hundred years a-gone. But the dramatis personae are not whom I thought they were. And, most unfortuitous of all, Miss Bennet, Mr. Darcy, that elegant, prideful man you were destined to marry has fallen for someone else... because you're not here, y'see? And poor Mr. Bingley! The poor gentleman has resolutely taken to drink. Oh, I wish we had not swapped places! I make a poor substitute for you, Miss Bennet.""

- Elizabeth: ""My dear Miss Price, you do yourself a great disservice. Surely the state of affairs could not be so horrid. But I profess, I do not know this Mr. Bingley of whom you are lamenting. As for your Mr. Darcy, I also have not had the pleasure of meeting the grand gentleman. And yet, oh, your declaration of my marital prospect does fill me with perturbation. Do you believe my dear Papa would think it amiss if I were to once more consider a protracted turn in your contemporary London? In your bustling world, Miss Price, I feel... unconfined.""

- Amanda: ""Oh, that's right, duh. We swapped places just when Austen's story was starting. And your presence is sorely marked by its absence. Tell me, Miss Bennet, do you know who Colin Firth is? He looks a bit like Mr. Darcy.""

- Elizabeth: ""Yes, I have seen Mr. Firth admirably ensconced in - what do you call those? - ah, moving pictures, and regard his countenance as most pleasing and not without an air of nobility. Sir Laurence Olivier is another whose not unhandsome features I have glimpsed in your cinema. I cannot believe that your Mr. Darcy is in any form superior to these two inestimable persons.""

- Amanda: ""Whatever. My biggest concern, Miss Bennet, is that I am simply not you, everyone's beloved and timeless heroine! How will people accept me? By standards of the Georgian period, I am not fit for polite company. I evidence indelicate manners and demonstrate lewd and vulgar conduct, a modern girl utterly out of her element. Oh, the subversiveness of it. I mean, I got caught smoking a ciggy! How will anyone like me? I'm lively like you, but, I'm afraid, lively in all the wrong ways. Please, Miss Bennet, dissuade me from these anxious thoughts or, if you are of like mind, be so kind as to concur with three dots.""

- Elizabeth: ""...""

- Elizabeth: ""Er, I understand that the DVD accommodates one with the movie trailer and the 43-minute-long Making Of featurette?""

In essence, the movie turns the story on its ear.  Characters from the novel are not acting as Ms Price knows they should, and she tries to set things aright--with very limited success.  We learn that Austen had somewhat misjudged some of the characters, Wickam in particular.  All that adds to the enjoyment.

3369211,5,B0014T7ETQ,"If you're obsessed with accuracy and looking for a perfect Jane Austen rendition, move on. But if you've ever sat and read the book, saw an Austen movie, and closed your eyes and wished a thousand times that you could go back in time and live in Jane Austen's day, this is great entertainment. How many of us wish we could be part of Darcy's world? Meet a man with manners or live in a world without TV's, iPods, computers and learn what the true intercourse of conversation meant? How true it would be that our modern lifestyles would actually make it very hard for us to adapt into a time and place we merely romanticize over and over again. How odd those characters would think our mannerisms were in return!

The series does just that, only Amanda's arrival sort of ""buggers"" up the story, if you get my drift. Nothing goes like it should and she tries to fix it all to the way it's suppose to be written in the book. Darcy, of course, is wonderfully attractive, the absolute snob, who can't figure out why he's ""tormented"" and attracted to a woman he frankly considers vulgar. It's fiction living inside of fiction - a phenomenal idea.

All I can say to the die-hard Austen fans, is lighten up folks! It's meant to be fun and enjoyable, not a perfect rendition of the original. It's called creative liberty. What always amazes me about obsessed fans of certain genre, is that they treat the originals as if they were written by the finger of God on stone and we're not to change, alter, or enjoy it in any other manner.

3369213,5,B0014T7ETQ,"What girl has read or seen Pride and Prejudice and not fantasized being Elizabeth Bennett?
A brief synopsis:  The current heroine, 21st century Amanda, is enthralled with Pride and Prejudice; through a time portal in her bathroom, she gets to change places with the novel's heroine Elizabeth Bennett. The filmmakers take this in two directions simultaneously....

* First,  Amanda creates a butterfly effect in that all the novel characters behave as one might expect but the outcome is quite different than what Jane Austen wrote for her characters.
* Second, Amanda is a fish out of water as she navigates a 200 year old society, while Elizabeth is coming to terms with the 21st century.

There are lots of little fun takeoffs and surprises.... For instance,
* The pond scene from the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice (Colin Firth version)is mimicked.
* The Charlotte Lucus character goes off in an entirely different direction.... literally
*  Jane's marriage is not what one would expect
* Amanda's virginity becomes an issue
* Mr. Darcy pays a visit to 21st century London (another fish out of water)
* The 18th century characters are properly impressed with Amanda's income of 25,000/year.
* Elizabeth is asked to play at the piano, she apparently played Petula Clark's Downtown

3369216,5,B0014T7ETQ,"Lost In Austen was a British mini series directed by Oscar winner Sam Mendes and written by Guy Andrews, and it was one of the most popular offerings on British television in 2008.

In fact, it was so popular that they brought it to the big screen. This charming homage to Pride and Prejudice and Jane Austen herself is an absolute delight.

Jemima Rooper is Amanda Price who steps through the portal between her reality and the fictional world inhabited by the Bennet family. Elliot Cowan is the smoldering Mr. Darcy. Hugh Bonneville is paternal as Mr. Bennet.

Florence Hoath is Kitty Bennet. Alex Kingston is Mrs. Bennet. Morven Christie is Jane Bennet. Perdita Weeks is Lydia Bennet. Tom Mison is Mr. Bingley. Ruby Bentall is Mary Bennet. Christina Cole is Caroline Bingley, and Gemma Arterton is Elizabeth Bennet. Tom Riley is Mr. Wickham, and Guy Henry is Mr. Collins.

The story goes like this. . . .

Amanda Price is an ardent Jane Austen fan who has read Pride and Prejudice too many times. Saddled with a boozy boy friend who has no shred of romance in his soul, she longs for the genteel world inhabited by Elizabeth Bennet.

When Amanda finds Elizabeth Bennet standing in her bathtub one night, her world as she knows it changes. Elizabeth tells her she stepped through a doorway in her attic, a door that had never opened before, and ended up in Amanda's bathrub. Before you can say alternate reality, Amanda is trapped in Jane Austen's world of mannered courtship and matchmaking intrigue.

Of course, Amanda's presence changes the course of Austen's novel so the poor girl ends up trying to keep the story on course. I won't spoil the story. Suffice it to say that you'll be surprised. It's an affectionate homage that will enchant you and make you glad to be Lost In Austen.",1280707200,,1790,4.681528662420382
3369217,5,B0014T7ETQ,"This film is a great mix of witty British humour and Jane Austen's classic masterpiece. If you like both of those, you'll probably enjoy ""Lost in Austen"". It's sympathetic to the original story, and rather than mocking it (like some other Austen take-offs) I felt it paid homage to the timelessness of the themes in ""Pride and Prejudice"". Two hundred years later, people still have the same feelings, despite the way they might speak, dress and pass their days. It's a testament to both Austen's writing and the writers/producers of this film.

(I won't recount the plot here, as it's been covered many times elsewhere.)

Aside from being an entertaining twist on the original story, I found it very interesting to see how the ""original characters"" were portrayed in comparison to earlier versions of P&P. It's not just silly comedy - these characters are well-developed and well-acted and not what you may have been programmed to expect. Mrs. Bennet in particular was played in a very different, yet still relevant and believable light, than in the 1995 version. Jemima Rooper did a great job as Amanda, skillfully blending the comedic aspects of the role with the dramatic elements of the story line.

I suspect a few jokes and comments here and there will be lost on non-British viewers, and I think it's a shame that a few scenes from the original series (as aired on TV in the UK)were cut.",1280448000,3,1394,4.8

Elizabeth and Darcy are meant to be together, and I sat up thinking over and over about whether I would chose Mr. Darcy for myself if given the chance.

I have decided against it. The movie itself isn't bad, but the ending will leave P&P lovers upset. The greatest love story ever told ended up not being told..",1279497600,6,630,4.241666666666666

The main appeal is that it speaks to a secret fantasy of what would happen if YOU could enter ""Pride and Prejudice""?  Jane Austen's work is so finely crafted that it seems impossible that society doesn't exist.  Surely you could actually be there, you must be able to step into Longbourn and meet the Bennet family.  So when this movie depicts that very thing of going back in time and reality, it gives you permission to explore the idea.  What if you could gaze into Darcy's eyes and hear his voice?  What would you say, how would you react??  What about trading places with Lizzy Bennet??

I must have seen that version a good 50 -100 times I should think!  I have since rented a few other versions of the movie just for comparison sake.  So yes, I do love the story.

I love the costumes of the day and the manners.  I too have imagined myself in the story...and I am good friends with Jane and Lizzie, and I end up with Colonel Fitzwilliam.  Lol!  So I loved the premise of this story.

I loved how the characters didn't duplicate the A&E version exactly.  Although I do have to admit that Mr. Collins was truly awful - more awful than I would have imagined him.  I liked to see how things changed because Lizzie was not there and because Amanda was.  It reminds me of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" when George Bailey sees how everything changes when he is not there.  It's remarkable what can happen all because of one person.  And I honestly liked the twist that they made with Mr. Wickham.  It was refreshing not to dislike him.

Jemima Rooper is just magnificent as the quintessential Jane Austen aficionado who gets to be the heroine in her favorite story something many of us would love to do I am sure. Mr. Darcy is just magnificent and his character is played the same way it has been played since Laurence Olivier did it in 1940 with his haughtiness and incomparable benediction. The only downside to an otherwise great version was that a very funny scene in which Jemima sings ""Downtown"" has been cut and leaves the viewer scratching its head because of the conversation followed right after.

3369231,4,B0014T7ETQ,"Watching `Lost in Austen', starring Jemima Rooper and Elliot Cowen is a great way to while away your afternoon if you are craving for a continuation of Darcy and Elizabeth's story.  But wait!  This isn't your typical sequel.  For that matter this isn't your typical movie.  At almost three hours long, 'Lost in Austen' gives Historical Romance fans of these modern days exactly what we've been craving, a hysterical adaptation of the BBC's 1995 rendition of 'Pride and Prejudice'.

Amanda Price, a cute red head in her mid-twenties, lands in the 19th-century world of author Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice.' She does this through what appears to be a bathroom cabinet door.  Already a huge fan of Austen, Amanda has at least some knowledge of the characters on the book, but is a fish out of water when it comes to customs and vernacular of the time period.

From the start, we must suspend belief.  This is a movie where the entire premise is based upon time travel into early 1800's.  Once you allow yourself to let go of science and reality, you are ready for an enchantingly wild ride.  Honestly, whoever made `Lost in Austen' realized we were ridiculously spoiled by the length and utter indulgences with character development we received with the BBC's rendition of `Pride and Prejudice.'

Miss Price is stuck in the past and Miss Bennet is trapped in the future.  In her attempts to fix the fact that she's bungling the story line, Amanda's first act is to send Jane through the rain to Netherfield.  This seems to be the only thing from the book that goes to plan.

Casting was a bit spotty for the movie, with some characters being wonderfully done and others physically lacking.  Wickham's treatment is fabulous and I'll probably be flogged for saying it, the most transformed and most enhanced character of the movie.  Bingley is, as always, simply adorable.  Kitty and Mary were cast perfectly.

I think there were problems with Lady Catherine, Mr. Bennet, Mrs Bennet and Miss Bingley.  Although Miss Bingley was as vapid and cruel as she reads, her looks didn't seem to match how I pictured her in my head.

We're wonderfully thrown off course and taken down a wild set of events that have Amanda fending off the advances of more than one man and even accepting a proposal.

The period people's reactions to our modern everyday non sequiturs are completely adorable.  During an intimate, almost sisterly moment, when asked by Jane what Amanda Price thinks of Mr. Darcy her response is pretty humorous.  `He's not Colin Firth, but even Colin Firth isn't Colin Firth.'

There are parts of the movie, where in modern times; Amanda's character would have been arrested for being considered a stalker.  Saying fantastical things and knowing intimate details.  As it is, she is considered eccentric and behaves `rather oddly familiar' with her friends.

As someone who cans and preserves actively, there is a wonderful scene where Mrs. Bennet brings Jane a bunch of jars of goodies when she visits her in her new home.

The treatment of Bingley and Jane is especially juicy because he has always been a conundrum to those of us who have `type A' personalities.  The writers for `Lost in Austen' really could have focused more of the film on them and not lost an ounce of their audience.  I was pulled into their struggled and wanted to see more of their plot line unfolding.

As it is, we do see it develop and a very satisfying resolution, but is any Austen fan really ever satisfied?  If you are reading this column, you are clearly not!  Sequels were made for people like us and will continue to be as long as we rant and rave about it!

Is it sacrilegious to toy with the base morals of the main characters in the original novel for the purpose of moving the story forward?  If it works, no.  For `Lost in Austen' it worked very well.  Admittedly this doesn't work all the time and sequels can become utter failures if done poorly.  However, we may be predisposed to allow it in this instance because we are already set in a `modern' tone for the romp.
individually to retain this template's appearance. Mr. Darcy in 'Lost in Austen'

There are parts of the movie where the bottom of your stomach drops out because of how the original plot of `Pride and Prejudice' has been so terribly muddled.  Characters you've put so much faith in have turned so far from the path you've known them to walk upon you fear the worst, but fear not.  It turns out for the best in the end.

I really highly recommend watching this movie.  If you have watched it, watch it again.  WARNING:  It is NOT for purists.  There are characters that are turned completely OUT of character, but as I've mentioned, it works.

Watch it simply for the few balls it shows.  I'll admit to the ridiculous joy in watching and enjoying those.  I'm a little like Lydia in that regard.

The hits:
1.) I loved the casting of Darcy. Not only was Elliot Cowan swoon-worthy (a pre-requisite in any Darcy casting), but the man could smolder with the best of them. Although, it must be said that this guy looks a lot like Stephen Moyer from ""True Blood.""

2.) I loved the twists and turns in this movie. You never knew where they were going to go next. There are three OMG bits, two oh-no-you-didn't parts, and a seriously loud screaming at the top of your lungs while clapping at the same time scene. (Believe me; you will know when you get to that last one especially.)

3.) I loved the interaction between the new heroine, Amanda Price, and Mr. Darcy. I loved how she not only seemed to get beneath his skin (like Elizabeth in the book), but she dug even deeper than that. She could make that man scream at her and lose his composure completely. Now, I have always been of a mind that the person who can make you that nuts is the one you should marry. Yes, Elizabeth and Darcy were much wittier in the book, and it was a pleasure to the senses and all that, but it was refreshing to see Darcy knocked for such a loop that he would yell at a woman he barely knew. It was nice to see him come down off his pedestal a little quicker than he does in the book.

4.) I loved that they made Miss Bingley is lesbian. It was totally inappropriate and wrong for her character, but I loved it nonetheless.

The misses:
1.) The fact that so many of the manners of that time period were ignored and, at times, bulldozed over by Amanda---all with no one seeming to care. It seemed out of place to me that she would show up in modern clothes and it would take that long for anyone to make her change. There are also the copious amounts of make-up she wears, the overall lack of couth on her part, and her ignorance of the common manners of the time. This is supposed to be a woman who has practically memorized ""Pride and Prejudice."" She should know what the right thing to do is as well as the wrong. Then, there is the fact that a large number of these wrong things are not even commented on by anyone. Common trollops wore make-up back then, not proper misses. Ms. Bingley (as much as she disdains anyone without good breeding) would have publically chastised Amanda about this if no one else. And don't get me started on Amanda's hair . . .

2.) The on-again/off-again engagements/weddings weren't realistic or even possible. That Mr. Collins would become engaged with Amanda and then just end it at the Netherfield ball is ridiculous. A man was pretty much cemented into an engagement once his proposal was accepted. A woman had a little more wiggle room here, but both parties would be subjected to harsh sanctions by society by ""crying off"" without some just and public cause. Then, there is the quick engagement between Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley. (which is never really talked about again later now that I think about it.) How is it that Miss Bingley, a woman whose sole mission was to secure Darcy, would blithely let him go to be with someone else? Why would a man such as Darcy make such a reckless proposal in the first place? Plus, there is the fact that, once someone as prideful and correct as Darcy popped the question and was accepted, he would follow through on the marriage. There would be no choice. Last, the marriage between Mr. Collins and Jane is utterly moronic. That the man would not consummate the marriage is contrived (as much as the fact that he would happily dissolve the marriage just because Lady Catherine told him to). Parts like these seemed to be written in simply for shock value. It cheapened the movie overall, and irritated the crap out of me.

3.) The idea that Bingley would fall for Amanda first is ludicrous. In the book, Bingley is beguiled at first by Jane's beauty, but falls in love with her sweet, gentle demeanor and overall generous presence. Since Amanda hasn't any of these qualities to recommend her, it felt a little foolish that Mr. Bingley would become enamored with her. Then, when you add the fact that Amanda gets drunk at the first assembly and makes out with Bingley in a darkened alley, you accelerate from ludicrous to the repeatedly-slapping-your-head-against-a-brick-wall-for-fun kind of stupid. I found myself screaming, ""What the hell are you doing?"" during that scene especially.

4.) I hated how they turned Wickham into a good guy. C'mon! Everyone knows Wickham is the unrepentant bad boy, and, honestly, I love him because of that. If you notice, there is a bad boy in every one of Austen's novels. I think she, like the rest of her sex, had a tendre for them. Who doesn't? So, making him into the nice guy is akin to taking a stud horse, cutting off his Johnson, and putting him out in the paddock with all the mares. What is the point? (And, while I am pointing it out: Why make Georgiana---in the two scenes they gave her---into a lying brat? I hated that one especially).

So, what is my recommendation? Well, if you are looking for a movie that is ""faithful to the original classic tale"" or some other such nonsense, look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you are looking for a rollercoaster ride of fun, shock, and laughs, I highly recommend this piece of fluff. You will not believe the three hours have gone by this quickly and, whether you have issues with it or not, I guarantee you will be clapping at the end.",1269216000,4,5871,4.474323062558357

""Lost in austen"" is the first thing I've seen that I haven't turned off in disgust. It's saving grace is that the main character, the girl who gets ""lost"" in Austen, is also a P&P snob with regards to the book and the A&E version. This matters because she comments on the fact that its not ""the original."" Her acknowledgment makes it okay somehow. For example, when she first meets Mr. Darcy, she says ""Well, he's no Colin Firth."" As she's screwing everything up, she realizes it.

Not sure if that came across as I meant it to. The main point is that this series gave me more of P&P (which is always good), without making me want to hunt down those that made it and lecture them on how they need to keep their mitts off anything Austen.",1268352000,,981,4.438888888888889

There were a couple of twists I didn't like-Bingley falling for Amanda. I mean seriously? Thankfully the writer did not continue on that.

But some of faves were

-Wickham turning out to be a good man after all. That was refreshing.
-And the best of all was Caroline Bingley being a lesbian. I mean really. Who saw that coming?

However, the writers take this way too far.  The characters are suddenly not at all like Austen wrote them.  I understand the outcomes would be different with this movie but I would imagine the characters should remain true to how they were originally written (and intended).  Instead you have Lizzie, who while is never seen, seems to think it completely acceptable to abandon her family and leave them to worry about her whereabouts.  Then there's Caroline Bingley who, as we all know, is after Darcy for marriage.  Spoiler alert here...What we might not have known is she is apparantly only interested in women but wants to marry Darcy because that's how it should be.  Not to mention that Georgiana is a brat who throws Wickham's name and character under the bus just to save her own skin because apparently he refused her advances and not the other way around.  And Darcy is just blind to it all...This is taking Jane Austen's work completely too far.  I wanted so badly to like this movie but I simply could not.

I don't know why I choose to pick this up, but I am SO glad I did: maybe because in my mind I already seperate books and movies...movies are often inspired by books or are edited versions of books, or are completely different, so I think of them seperately. 'Lost in Austen' was a hilarious & refreshing Jane Austen romp: you just have to have fun with it!

As far as content goes, I will watch it again shortly and come back & update this, but I don't recall much beyond a little language and maybe some sensual sitations: things like an unmarried couple living together in the modern world, etc. It's reasonably family-friendly:

The actors were great, Darcy was absolutely smoldering at times: when Amanda takes Lizzie's place, her modern clothes, language, actions & that song (you know what I mean!) are quite funny! If it were I that was pulled back into that world, I feel I would have fit in better: the twists on characters stories, and on their character itself, was more amusing than disturbing: just think of this as a fun, random, not-true film and you won't mind that the story is a bit skewed: you'll be too busy rolling on the floor laughing ~ definitely recommend!",1265414400,,1434,4.59375

Less those be fighting words for some, I loved what this movie offered and found Jemima Rooper in the lead as Amanda Price to be delightful in all of her ""modern girl steps into fictional period times where mishaps occur underfoot wherever she arrives.""

I am a HUGE P&P fan, have researched the book extensively and even wrote my masters thesis on it.  I know the characters, plot, scenes, and dialouge inside out and backwards.  The screen writer took everything we know about P&P and re-interpreted it.  IT WORKED!  Granted, there are somethings for which you will have to suspend your disbelief- the fact that a secret door to the Bennet's home magically opens in Amanda Price's bathroom for one- but that is what give the movie a lot of it's charm.  It is a re-invention of the story, the answer to the ""I wish I was Elizabeth Bennet!"" day dream!  No one can replace Elizabeth, the story DOES get botched without her, but it is a very funny journey to watch!  Especially with the references to the 1995 BBC mini-series.
I give 4/5 stars because the development of Darcy and Amanda's relationship is supposed to mirror that of Darcy and Elizabeth's, but misses the mark slightly for me.  However, this is the absolute BEST portrayal of Bingly I have ever seen, hands down, Tom Mison absolutely nails it.  Its definitely a different Bingly than the novel, but I think the new story line lends itself well to an otherwise shallow character.  We get a bit more depth to him, and he is no less loveable!

Much as I found myself rooting for the modern girl, she couldn't hold a candle to Elizabeth. But I did love how well Elizabeth adjusted to the present, from her haircut to her earrings to her using the computer.

Two things that bugged me? Amanda's hair! She never puts it up! She's in the Regency clothes but it never dawns on anyone to give her a bobby pin? So aggravating. Second, Mr. Collins was downright repulsive. He's a buffoon, not a pervert.

Otherwise it was a fascinating take on Austen's tale. Some parts were a little too melodramatic (Mr. Bennet dueling made me roll my eyes) and Amanda was far too modern in clothes and attitude to strike me as a rabid Austen fan. I think it would've been interesting if she'd been forced to read the book for a college course then found herself in the story.",1260230400,2,1299,4.404166666666667

3369282,5,B0014T7ETQ,"There's nothing deep or literary about Lost in Austen. It's a time travel tale that incorporates all the standard glitches, as 21st century Amanda tries to navigate her way around the style and conventions of the 19th century. Because she curls up with Austen every time she feels stressed, Amanda knows what should be happening in this strange new (old) world, but somehow, the characters simply won't behave as planned.

If not taken too seriously, this foray into Pride and Prejudice is delightful. It's genuinely entertaining to watch well known and loved  characters adopt wills of their own. Jemima Rooper as Amanda is spot on, as she struggles to speak and conduct herself in accordance with Regency mores. Elliot Cowan makes a fine Mr. Darcy, although at times he seems to be channeling Heathcliff instead, and Tom Mison as Mr. Bingley threatens to upstage Darcy at several points. Supporting cast members are equally true to form. The scenery is stunning, and costumes reflect proper period detail, despite their rather muted colors.

Interestingly, our heroine is a modern day Londoner who is in love with the world of Austen's creation. Specifically, Pride & Prejudice. I can get being so into a book that you read it over and over. But wanting to live in that time period? Why would any modern woman want to go back to that time? Yet I did believe that Amanda was truly in love with the book, the characters, that world.

I love the faithfulness to Austen's original work with little bits tweaked just enough to fit Amanda in. It really draws you into the story - so much so that I watched the entire thing in (mostly) one sitting - and was annoyed when I had to pause to go do other things briefly.

I agree with other reviewers that it was a good idea, but horrendously done.  All the original ""Pride and Prejudice"" characters are distorted, unrecognizable.  Why can't our time traveler meet characters that are true to the way Jane Austen described them?  And why do they all so easily accept Lizzy's absence?  And why would Darcy ever fall in love with such an unlikable woman?
I love Jane Austen.  I love science fiction, historical fiction, and especially time travel.  I love the idea of a 21st Century woman suddenly finding herself in a good Jane Austen/Regency Era plot.  This movie should have been a dream come true for me.  But it is apparently too much to ask for a dignified, likable 21st Century heroine.

3369291,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I caught this series on the Ovation channel. I was disdainful but curious and watched the show ready to hate it. I ended up loving it instead. The actors are outstanding, the story is very creative and there are little twists and changes in some of the characters that we have come to love and hate from Pride and Prejudice. I was ready to hate Amanda (the modern, dropped in character) and ended up falling in love with her. She was combination of softness and strength and had the brashness of a modern girl, I often fantasize about when reading a period novel. Not quite in your face but very straightforward.

I apologize to P&P die-hard fans, but I was very glad that Elizabeth was not in the series that much. I have always found her to be irritating but the actress that plays her is quite lovely and what I imagined Elizabeth to look like. If you are into Lizzie, this may not be the series for you.

Word of advise though. When purchasing, check you DVD asap. I'd purchase this DVD straight from Amazon and my copy is missing Amanda's performance of ""Downtown"". It wasn't a skip, but a complete cut of this scene. I stopped watching it because I frankly did not want to find any other scenes missing.

However, I did give the series a 5 star rating because the series itself is sensational.

If you are a die-hard fan of P&P, I hope you are open because this is a lovely fantasy for anyone that has ever wanted to be with Mr. Darcy.",1254268800,2,1441,4.365671641791045
3369292,5,B0014T7ETQ,"We are living through a great age of Jane Austen inspired prequels/sequels and revisions.  Would she be amused or insulted that her works, Pride and Prejudice in particular, have inspired so many others to project what their vision is or what they feel was not stated on the written page?  Who can say, but I personally like to think that somewhere she feels a bit bemused and a bit chagrined, winking and enjoying the whole lot all the same.

Amanda Price (charmingly played by the ever talented Jemima Rooper) is a 21st century London girl, unsatisfied with her life and eager to escape her world through the pages of her favorite novel - Pride and Prejudice.  She visualizes the written world of Pemberley, Longbourne and Rosings in her mind and longs for the romance of it all.  Always be careful what you wish for, my dear, for you just might get it and it may turn out to be far more complicated that what you've envisioned.  Enter Elizabeth Bennet (rising star Gemma Arterton) through a doorway portal and commence the hijinks.

The entire cast works well together, but the Wickham turnaround in the hands of the excellent Tom Ripley was a particularly witty plot twist that worked well.  The classically trained Elliot Cowan was a marvelous Mr. Darcy and had excellent screen chemistry with Ms. Rooper.  I'm a Janeite and have either read or watched marvelous adaptations as well as lackluster interpretations.  This is, most assuredly, the former and not the latter.",1254009600,4,1475,4.817460317460317
3369293,2,B0014T7ETQ,"It was with a bit of trepidation that I decided to watch this movie. I figured it was likely to be stupid, but I was in the mood for a bit of mindless fun, so I went with it.
Don't get me wrong, there is mindless fun to be had - but this film has no artistic merit whatsoever (which must be why so many people seem to love it).

At the start, I thought it might be okay - I mean, here's this girl Amanda, her favorite book is Pride and Prejudice, she's disappointed with modern life, and she gets a chance to go back in time and see what life was really like - not her romantic idealization of the whole Elizabeth-Darcy courtship.
She goes back and finds out that society was very rigid, restrictive, there were a lot of rules to follow and you couldn't even get a decent toothbrush!
Right up till about the point when Darcy tells Amanda he could never marry her, I felt like the film had some integrity - even if some of the liberties taken with the characters and their conversations were incongruous with the times in which they were set.
But then after that, consumed with the need to give everyone a happy ending, the plot becomes so ridiculous and contrived - as well as stretching the characters past recognition - that it is impossible to have any respect for the film or take any pleasure in the outcome for the characters.
All we Austen fans love Pride and Prejudice - I've read it a number of times, and the love story is always satisfying. But the truth is, Jane Austen wrote that book for the same reason so many novels get written: to create a world the way it should be, rather than the way it is. In real life, Darcy likely would not have married Elizabeth, even if he wanted to, for just the reasons stated clearly by him in the book. After all, Jane could not marry the man she loved because she lacked a fortune.
And even if Darcy and Elizabeth had married, there's no proof that they would have been as happy as Austen tells us they intend to be.
Women tended to have baby after baby, not a lot of freedom, and in Elizabeth's world, despite the money and status, quite a lot of tedious obligations to fulfill as part of her role.
I think a movie about a modern woman coming to realize just how unromantic the Regency period really was would have been far more compelling. Sure, the clothes were pretty - and the English countryside ravishing, but really, what modern woman would actually choose to live in a world where she had few rights or choices, marriage was a mercenary undertaking and she was entirely dependant on a husband or father for her support?
But I digress.
About the only character I thought was materially improved was Wickham. Am I the only one who's ever thought Austen was a little too harsh on him for enjoying having sex with women? Oh, I know, it was a different time and place, and the indulgence of a man's pleasure could ruin a woman, both financially and socially. So a man who toyed with women that was WAS truly a cad - but again, it comes back to the advantages of living in modern times, when sex and sexuality are more free and open - so it fits with the thesis of disillusionment with Austen romances...

And really, doesn't it strike anyone else as a little disappointing, that our heroine, who is trying to make right what she has screwed up, makes her promise to Lady Catherine, then runs back to Darcy?
It takes a little of the pleasure out of the moment to think that now Jane gets to stay stuck in her marriage to the hideous Mr. Collins.
I guess when it comes right down to it, I'm not really equipped for mindless fun - which this totally is. If you don't think about any of what it means and aren't bothered by a plot and characters that don't stay true to themselves - even as reinvented here - then I think you will enjoy this film.",1253923200,3,3797,4.3090909090909095

There are some moments when you slap your palm to your face and go, ""What the heck?""

There's an old saying that is very applicable here: be careful what you wish for.

I didn't like it.

it just seemed weird and odd that these character I love, their personalities are different & they're doing things they wouldn't do and things were twisted.

It's hard to explain :P

Mr & Mrs Bennet have an unhappy marriage.
Mr Wickham is actually good? And Caroline Bingley is a lesbian? Mr Bingley becomes a drunk? That is not what Jane Austen wrote. they can't just change that! It is supposed to be about a girl who stumbles into the world of Pride & Prejudice. Not a world where the Pride & Prejudice characters are not what they seem.

I also hated when they wanted to get a cheap laugh out of us in some parts. Like when Mr Darcy is on the bus and sees a child reading a tellytubbie book & then later sees a telly tubby doll and exclaims ""Tinky Winky!"" Not a very Mr Darcy thing to do. And the lesbian scene where Caroline Bingley confesses she is a lesbian.

I hated the ending. Elisabeth run off to the modern world unstead of being with Darcy, Amanda agree to marry her boyfriend & then run off with Darcy leaving him broken & without an explanation & Lady Catherine miraculously promises to Divorce Mr Collins & Jane.

The whole thing felt so strange that by the time Mr Bennet gets stabbed in the neck and is dying I realise I no longer care & I feel like switching it off. These were not the characters I've loved since my teens. Theses were modernised, depressing, twisted, cheap, cast offs and I didn't care about them one bit.

The only character I still liked was Jane. That was only because they didn't change her in anyway & that she was missing for half the show!

It was truely a strange experience watching this. It was a good idea and I looked forward to it and shunned bad reviews that I read before I watched it and I was even more keen about this than the idea of ""Pride & Prejudice an zombies"". But now I'm disapointed.

I loved the turns & twists, but also the way each character is developed based on their own characteristics (for example: I've always liked Bingley as a character because he is described as a very nice, loyal, gentlemanlike and amiable man but he is also weak) so it is interesting, once knowing each charcaters' qualities and flaws to see them developed in a ""what if"" scenario such as this.

I can take it when things are changed for movies, and obviously for this film things would be completely changed. So I went into it ready to just go along for the ride. Try as I might, I just couldn't do it. This was horrible! Terrible! I couldn't believe how many great reviews this got. I got about an hour and fifteen minutes into it, then I just couldn't take it anymore and started fast-forwarding so that I could see what happened without actually having to watch the thing anymore (I have to admit that I was curious as to where they were going to go with it). From what I saw it didn't get any better. Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books, and this in no way resembled any of it. Other than the name, I didn't recognize any of the characters. Mrs. Bennet was downright menacing, but not fun. Darcy was mean. Bingley was just pathetic. The things that these characters ended up doing were totally out of character for them (Jane marry Mr. Collins? She has far too much sense for that). It was as if the writer was focused on what he could make the characters do, rather than looking at what, if a stranger was dropped in their midst and Elizabeth wasn't there, the characters would naturally do. I felt like they just simply tacked the character name onto a character of their own making.

There were a lot of vulgar things in this movie. I am not a prude, but there are some things that I don't think are necessary (like Amanda flashing Lydia and discussing pubic hair). I had the feeling that Amanda was supposed to be the everywoman living out the fantasy of the Jane Austen addict (a chance to meet Mr. Darcy), but I feel really bad for modern women if she is truly representative. She is crass, crude, and, I am sorry to say, rather stupid. She bumbled through most of the movie, making no attempt to fit into the society in which she found herself. If she had truly read Pride and Prejudice as many times as she says she had, she would have known what was acceptable at the time and tried not to act as if she was in her own time.

I just simply couldn't bring myself to like Amanda. Apparently both Bingley and Darcy thought that she was very attractive, but I couldn't figure out why. I understand that Bingley got to see some leg (she was wearing pants) and down her shirt when she courtseyed, but I thought that he should have been better than that. Seeing him oggling her was disappointing. At the time, either one of them should have been embarrassed at the thought of bringing her into polite society. Why would they think of marrying her (Elizabeth and Jane's family was objectionable, but they never were)?

Overall, I was very disappointed in this. Crude and laughable without being funny, I felt that it was horrible. After I found out the ending (which, by the way, I won't reveal, but I don't get how that is supposed to be a happy ending for the viewer) I had to get out the original book to redeem the characters. At least I didn't buy this movie; I got if from the library.",1249430400,54,3081,4.336221837088388

Imitators (the sincerest form of flattery) have also scored major successes ranging from d. 1855 Elizabeth Gaskill's North & South&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-South/dp/B000AYEL6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North & South</a>&nbsp;to d. 1996 Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones' Diary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridget-Jones-s-Diary-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0002W4SWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridget Jones's Diary (Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and now, Lost in Austen!

This charming four-part ITV mini-series has been streamlined into a three hour film starring Jemima Rooper as Amanda Price and Elliot Cowan as the broodingly handsome Fitzwilliam Darcy and a delightful turn by Alex Kingston as Mrs. Bennett.  In keeping with the new millennium's revisionist takes on everything from Cinderella to Robin Hood to Sherlock Holmes, writer Guy Andrews has created an interesting ""what if"" screenplay.  What if a modern day woman named Amanda went thru a door in her bathroom and ended up in Regency England living with the Bennett family? What if Jane married badly?  What if Wickham wasn't a villain?  What if Mrs. Bennett had honest grievances? What if Elizabeth wanted a different life?

And gentle readers, I give it four stars instead of five because: there are no natural breaks in the lengthy one disc story, the script is very ironic and exhibits prochronisms such as antibiotics and lip gloss; and worst of all, we aren't privy to a major plot point because of a copyright issue.",1249430400,4,2262,6.485049833887043

When she trades places with Elizabeth Bennet she does everything she can to keep things on track. But what happens when things start to go horribly wrong? And how is Amanda supposed to survive without electricity or toothpaste?

One word: hilarious. I pretty much laughed my way throughout much of video. I had no idea what to expect, and I loved the amount of suspense throughout the entire show. Amanda knows the story by heart, and it was hilarious watching her trying to desperately keep things going the way they are written. How many times have you found yourself wishing that you had the chance to live in a different time? I know I've had a dream or two about that. Watching Amanda get the chance to do that was almost just as good!

The character's were great. When they get thrown into these really weird situations, it was funny to watch them try to figure everything out. I definitely recommend Lost in Austen to those who are ready for a good laugh and willing to not take anything too seriously. :)",1249257600,9,1120,4.485294117647059

But things soon become complicated when characters in the novel do not act as Jane Austin intended.  Amanda tries her best to fix things and the movie moves along at a jaunty pace.  Purist will not like how Jane Austin's classic is jumbled by Amanda.

Things start to fall apart at the end. Time portals start popping up all over and characters travel between the two at will.  A character's ""need"" drives the time portals but it becomes too sloppy a device for me.  The way Amanda kept pulling 21st century items, as needed, from her clothing seemed a bit much.

3369318,4,B0014T7ETQ,"""lost in austen"" is charming and lots of fun. at three hours long (it was originally four episodes on british tv) i never really felt the length. the plot was a clever blend of plot surprises (the ""wrong"" people falling in love) and character surprises. lady catherine is almost likable in this version and wickham, miss bingley and even lizzie have unexpected character changes.

you may not like all the changes and so many surprises, but this is a time travel fantasy so i parked all notions of verisimilitude outside and let my suspension of disbelief run wild. there was just so much fun to be had. and you can always go back and watch an authentic version or even reread the book. my 19 year-old daughter who has only seen the keira knightly film version (once), got completely hooked just walking by and sat down to watch the fun. she got an amazing number of the inside jokes, too, so you probably only need to know the basic plot to enjoy it. i really liked mr. bennet, who seemed to grow as the film wore on. i never really warmed to this darcy that much, but he wasn't allowed the dramatic interventions that showed us another side of him. instead, we see an even harder side of him. lizzie, in a severely shortened role, is remarkable and her character really ""worked"" for me. and i really enjoyed the creation of the other collinses, from lizzie's random remark in the novel where she wonders in mr. collins has a cousin. and this really is the ""worst"" (or best worst) collins ever.

i also liked the modern girl, amanda, who longs for civility an charm so lacking in her life and times. it's also cool that she's a working class girl and not privileged in any way except in her heart.

i enjoyed it enough to buy it after i'd watched it on a rental. that's becoming rarer and rarer, i think, so that's a considerable compliment in itself. i've now watched it five or six times since my purchase and i still find it charming. the writer seems to have had quite a lot of fun and you can tell that in almost every scene.",1249084800,3,2031,4.410666666666667

I've learned that to watch a modern movie, you may have to turn your head and politely ignore a few moments of dialogue.  This movie, however was sprinkled with such disgusting bits and pieces that I finally had to say ""Enough!"" and turned it off forever.  It had such promise. Being a Jane Austen fan I looked forward to seeing a movie of a modern-aged Jane Austen reader being trapped in the works of Jane Austen.  I wonder, however, how a woman so indecent, so crass could read the works of Jane Austen, and it not affect her behavior in a positive manner.  This woman, was in her conversation, so repulsive that she would have probably been arrested, or at the very least, shunned.  What an insult this movie is to anyone who watches it.  I am surprised that it has such good reviews by others, all I can say is that they were cheated, and don't even know it.",1248998400,16,934,4.364161849710983

In the movie, Miss Price constantly says how Darcy and Elizabeth are destined for one another and are the greatest love story ever told, yet Miss Price takes Darcy for herself at the end. I feel the ending would have been much better if Miss Price had returned to her own time (2008) and discovered that her boyfriend Michael was, in fact, her own version of Mr. Darcy and that she loved him.

Other than the ending, I found the DVD greatly amusing and found myself laughing out loud, gasping, and extremely interested in the plot.

Elizabeth has been waiting for her chance to sneak over to current day London and so the swap is made.  The film then carry's on in the 1800's with a modern day woman trying to adapt to it.  By the end of the film she has messed up everything with just about everyone and realizes that she has done so.  As she returns to current day London she realizes that she has learned a lot about herself and is able to do things she hadn't thought of doing before like getting rid of the dead beat boyfriend on her couch.  Best of all is Darcy who wins her heart!
The film was entertaining.  Was it a better than the real story of Pride and Prejudice? Definitely not. Was it a refreshing look at the Bennett family? No. I liked the original characters from Pride and Prejudice much better than in this film (though Wickhams character in this movie is much nicer than in Pride and Prejudice).  However, if you were to view this movie as a stand alone story and not constantly compare it to the book Pride and Prejudice, you will enjoy it.

The thing I found most disappointing (and revolting) is this idea that movie-makers seem to have that they must introduce sexual vulgarity in order to make a historical movie interesting. This movie reminded me a lot of the ""Mansfield Park"" movie (1999), which introduced slavery and rape--that's NOT in the book! In ""Lost in Austen"" I was disgusted when learning about Mr. Collins' habits. And when Jane starts to show partiality to him, I turned off the movie.
The other thing that was disappointing was the blind credulity of the Bennett family and others of Amanda's modern language, manners and clothing. Her modern clothes are ""otter-hunting"" garb?!?
Part of the appeal of the book, for me, was Elizabeth's ability to overcome the social blunders of her family and help Mr. Darcy to see her as she truly was. Amanda's crudeness should have had her shunned from good society of the Austen era.",1245974400,28,1147,4.8274111675126905

The main character, Amanda's behavior was shocking and awkward in a Regency England setting (like wearing the wrong clothes, swearing outloud, and predicting the future), but the staple Pride and Prejudice characters react right in character. They actually behave more like themselves than the original characters, if that's possible. At first Amanda's outbursts were startling, but after a while I enjoyed them. She said what any modern reader would say outloud as she read her favorite book.

Because I am an Austen fan, the twisting of the Pride and Prejudice love stories made me queasy and worried for the final outcome of my favorite characters. Would Darcy and Elizabeth still be able to fall in love? I kept wanting Amanda to go back to modern life and leave my characters alone, but yet, I couldn't stop watching.

It starts off great and it seems wonderful, but slowly the script becomes messy and the story line is messed up. I tried to think of ways to fix the script and came up with a few improvements, but in the end the story line is weak and not enjoyable. I hate to say this but it kind of ruined pride and prejudice for me. Overall it's an okay movie. I would not recommend it for pride and prejudice fans. It almost came off as a mockery of pride and prejudice. The acting is a bit over done, but believable. The costumes are well enough and the locations are beautiful. The lighting is okay it could have been better in a few scenes. The director did a great job with the camera angles and the editing is fast past. Overall, I think most people will be happy with this movie. I was hoping for a more gentle version, such as the girl that would go back in time would be of the gentle type and would fit in more naturally, but than we would lose the comedy. I do believe that some pride and prejudice fans will find this movie enjoyable. That is they will like the oddities the movie shows and the odd plots twist and turns. But in my opinion i thought the script predictable and a little vulgar. I'm not trying to hurt anyones feelings.  If i was the script writer; I would focus the story line to be more comical and romantic. That no matter what the character would not interferer with the story of Dacey and Lizzy, but would add to it, by falling in love with another character within the story that could be introduced as a brother or a friend for example the cousin of Mr. Darcey.

Please don't send me hate mail, because i didn't love this movie. I wanted to like it, but i couldn't because of how predictable it is. But I'm sure that many people will enjoy this movie sine it has a fun twist to it.

Instead it was crass and crude and has little redeeming quality to it at all.  The ""heroine"" purports to adore Pride & Prejudice, and to have read it often, yet when she finds herself in that world, she makes it clear she learned nothing of manners and genteel behavior in all her readings of it.  She uncaringly bashes around making no effort not to shock or offend everyone around her as she heavy-handedly messes in everyone's lives without any thought to their feelings.

The plot is convoluted and several times things happen ""just because"" but for no logical reason in the course of the story.  (Granted Elliott Cowan is very handsome soaking wet in a clinging shirt but it made absolutely no sense for it to happen and certainly not for him to agree to it as Darcy.)

I will be so thankful to get reliable information regarding this matter.",1244592000,,1047,4.7845303867403315
3369343,5,B0014T7ETQ,"This is a great adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.  It is about a girl from our time who changes places with Elizabeth Bennett.  At first she tries to keep the story going but in the end the story takes her over.  As a huge Austen fan, I loved this movie.  I thought it was a clever and fresh take on a story that many people try to remake.",1244592000,,340,3.9558823529411766
3369344,3,B0014T7ETQ,"Originally a 4-part British miniseries, Austen's timeless story is given a modern twist - Amanda Pryce, a modern day British woman is thrust into the mannerly world of the 18th century Bennett family, while just about every gentleman falls for her.  As she tries to return home (Elizabeth Bennett has taken her place in modern day London, which unfortunately is not explored), all the characters take paths not prescribed by Austen, much to Amanda's dismay, and it is up to her to right the wrongs.

While the plot is inventive and at first intriguing, it quickly gets old as the story drags on nearly 3 hours and starts to become redundant; it could have easily been trimmed by an hour and still told a compelling and entertaining story. The acting is outstanding, and Darcy is at his pompous best. The production values and cinematography are also first rate. A huge missed opportunity was not following Elizabeth's journey into the future filled with cars, televisions, mobile phones, and property rights for females. Definitely recommended for Austen fans.",1244592000,,1060,5.017045454545454
3369345,1,B0014T7ETQ,"This is truly one of the worst films I have ever tried to watch.  I left the room after the whole pubic hair incident and accusing Lydia of being a lesbian.  It was all absolutely unnecessary and ruined any chance of me finishing the movie.  I can accept bad acting and some liberties being taken to keep Jane Austen's work afresh today, but this was beyond a disgrace.  Trash like this movie makes me appreciate works devoid of modern filth used in order to attract a larger audience.  Sex has become a perversion and I am really outraged that anyone who has the power to give permission to Jane's work being used allowed her name and characters to be associated with this movie.  Nothing Jane Austen about it other than beloved characters being stripped down and degraded.  Words cannot begin to describe how awful this movie is.

Things to note with this edit:  1) It was Lydia and not Jane as I had incorrectly stated earlier that was in the bed.  2) I stand by my original review but will add that it was not only the missuse of Jane Austen's ORIGINAL work that ignited my dislike, but how uncomfortable I felt trying to watch it.

If you like silly, poorly scripted rip offs of popular characters and movies this is the film for you.  While the movie may be clever and original in taking a modern girl into the world of Jane Austen it lost all merit in not appreciating the world of Jane Austen.  Sure us modern folk would scoff and roll our eyes at men courting women and not jumping into bed with them, but some of us still like our women to be ladies.

This movie did not add up.  If the heroine had been thrown into the times not already knowing the novel then I could understand her crudeness and stupidity.  However she did and thus is subject to my scathing and unsymphathetic review.",1244332800,36,1797,4.416413373860182

Amanda Price, our heroine, longs for romance and the refined manners of Austen's era.  She knows all the characters of the book almost better than her own friends.  When Amanda finds herself trading places with Elizabeth Bennett the events of book start changing and Amanda works very hard to get the right couples together.  She keeps telling Darcy about Elizabeth (who is living in modern day England)and tries not to fall in love with him herself.  The characters are well developed and all the twists and turns make for a great story.  If you are a ""Pride & Prejudice"" fan you will love it, but it is also fun for those who don't have all the dialogue between Elizabeth and Darcy memorized.
It is pure delight and the extra footage on the making of the show is a great plus.
I recommend it most highly.  Perfect for the Jane Austen fan!!!!",1244160000,,1016,4.554945054945055

It would be interesting to see what that would be like for a day or more. The only part I was disappointed in was when they cut out the scene where Jemima Rooper's character was singing ""Down Town"". I watched it online. On the DVD, the characters wanted to hear her sing and that next thing you know, there applauding and commenting on her singing, without her ever singing. I don't know if it was omitted because of copyright laws on the song or what. But it would have been nice to have left it in. Otherwise, I had no other complaints.",1243987200,,804,4.33112582781457

3369355,5,B0014T7ETQ,"Imagine a 21st century girl who switches places with Elizabeth Bennet in P&P and finds herself trying to make her way in early 19th century England with all of its proper manners. Amanda drops into the P&P story complete with the Bennet family and Bingley and Darcy. She is dismayed to discover that when she's entered into the mix instead of Elizabeth, nothing seems to be working out quite the way it does in the book. Because she knows the plot after having read it millions of times, she tries to fix things with disastrous results -- story lines get mixed up, people marry the wrong people, etc.
When Darcy turns out to be even more of a prig than she had imagined, she still can't stop herself from falling in love with him. There's a hilarious scene with Darcy emerging from a pond (at Amanda's request) with a wet shirt clinging to his chest that should make fans of the 1995 P&P movie giggle.
Another fun part of the story is how Elizabeth is taking to modern times complete with computer and iPod. After what she's seen, she has a hard time going back to her old life.
It's lots of tongue-in-cheek fun that I recommend for a long plane ride or a rainy afternoon.",1243468800,3,1172,4.430555555555555
3369356,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I'm holding up my credentials to verify that I am an Austen-phile and a huge fan of Pride and Prejudice. I even found fun in the Bollywood version (""Bride and Prejudice"")! That said, I can state that this was a lovely twist on the classic novel, as well as an amusing take on what it means to be addicted to P&P, as so many of us are!

As Amanda's actions in old time England started to turn the standard plot on its ear, I found myself enjoying not so much the plot turns themselves as the take on each character. Those of us who have read the book many times and seen all the incarnations expect certain things of each character. It was fascinating to watch how they would react to new events (even though the characters were unaware of how things SHOULD have gone.) Like other reviewers, I don't want to give these twists away. Some played better than others, I suppose, but I'll bet all of us Austen fans will like different things - and different takes on character - from other Austen fans. Still, the acting was fine, the ladies were charming, the men suitably hot.

And speaking of us Austen fans, not only was it fun to put myself in Amanda's shoes (which would not fit me well), but I liked the amusing in-jokes aimed at Austen addicts. And if I'm including a little bit of a SPOILER here, the moment when Mr. Darcy jumped in the lake was delicious on many levels and showed us that the screenwriters were not only lovers of P&P, they possessed a devilish sense of humor. Post-modern indeed!

I recommend this one as a fine way to spend a rainy afternoon. It made me want to form a club: we read the book out loud together, then watch all the incarnations, one after another, fortifying ourselves with a feast fit for Bingley's table!",1243296000,3,1744,4.393188854489164
3369357,5,B0014T7ETQ,"Imagine entering the pages of your favorite book, walking with and speaking with literary characters you know so well, then finding the story moving in new directions because you are there. That is exactly what happens to Amanda when she finds herself in Jane Austen's Pride And Predjudice. Amada continues to push the characters in the direction she knows they should be going, but alas, it isn't working. And that is the fun of the film.

Originally aired as a four-part series on BBC, the DVD combines all four parts into a very decent film. I did not see the original four parts, I cannot tell you if anything was cut, I can only say I found the film neither too long nor too short. I did find it very entertaining.

I would say the film would be better enjoyed if you have watched the excellent Colin Firth version within the last year or so. Or be very familiar with the tale. Those not familiar with the story - and there must be a few - should aquaint themselves with the story before watching this film. Otherwise, they miss the fun.

However, once inside the story, things don't go exactly as Jane Austen planned! The results of Amanda's interference are both funny and heartbreaking. . I don't think this show is meant to be taken seriously as a period piece. It seems to be more tongue in cheek with many inside jokes for lovers of all things Jane Austen. If you try to take this as a direct adaptation or a strict period piece you will be disapointed.

3369366,5,B0014T7ETQ,"Hold on tight, this English mini-series walks a precarious line between being part very funny comedy, part drama, part romance, part fantasy in it's own right versus simply being outright offensive to Austenphiles and their beloved memories and characters.

The plot is fantastic: modern girl, Amanda Price, no apparent relation to Fanny, pines for genteel age of 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Mr. Darcy'.  Somehow, she exchanges places with a very willing, flesh and blood Elizabeth Bennet.  What ensues becomes total chaos and unpredictability as Amanda's wish disrupts all that is sacred in the Austen world, and try as may to fix it- it just gets worse.

How do the new characters compare?  The parents and the sisters are fine giving us more indepth details of who they truly are, Mr. Bennet- reasonable, Mama- unreasonable, a tigress for her family security.  Caroline Bingley(Christina Cole- soon to be in another English TV series-""Emma"".  Can you believe it!) is one of my favorites.  Of course, she's sharp tongue and brilliantly malevolent.  Mr. Collins probably the best Collins yet, more slimy and stupid; Wickham- handsome and really not what he seems; Lady Catherine(Lindsay Duran- remember her as Lady Burtram in 'Mansfield Park'-1999)stalwart as the grand matriarch.  And Darcy?  Elliot Cowan stays true to the misunderstood but noble hero's image. Tough boots to fill. My wife thinks he's great.  Must be.

Finally, the heroine(Jemima Rooper- don't know her- lots of TV work): to like or not to like?  That is the question.  She's no Elizabeth Bennet.  But she definitely says what's in her head whether she wants to or not.  She's awkward and out of place in both worlds, a bit obnoxious and uncouth.  She desperately wants to do the right thing.  Most of the time, she can't help herself let alone anyone else; lovesick and vulnerable, we couldn't help but root for her.

This miniseries is very well shot with all the beautiful trappings of locations and costumes and good actors.  Three hours long with a very good 40 minute ""making of"" segment in the special features.

Tried and true, stick to the story, Austen fans will probably be put off by the changes and the slight offensiveness.  But we laughed immensely. 'Lost in Austen' is it's own creation. Each episode is a surprise.  Where is this story going?  What unbelievable yet still somewhat reasonable actions do the characters intend to pull off?  How will they wrap this all up?

I'd give 4- 4 1/2 stars because I'm not very discerning at times about things of the heart, but this series has lots of heart and believe it or not, romance.  My Elizabeth says to give it 5.  Ok.",1242864000,4,2654,4.901123595505618

Being released soon on DVD....Pre-Order from Amazon!? Yes! Yes! Must. Have. NOW! WANT!

""Amanda Price is sick of the modern world. She yearns for the romance and elegance found in the books by her favorite author, Jane Austen. But she's about to get a rude awakening as one fateful evening, she is propelled into the scheming 19th century world of Pride and Prejudice while that book's Elizabeth Bennet is hurled into hers. As the book's familiar plot unfolds, Amanda triggers new romantic twists and turns within the Bennet family circle as she clumsily tries to help the sisters nab husbands and even captivates the tantalizing Mr. Darcy herself. But what about Elizabeth...and what will become of one of the world's greatest love stories?""

Of course my favourite rendition of Pride & Prejudice is the Colin Firth BBC-1, A&E version...But to be lost in the novel? And really, Ladies? Who does not want to see Darcy again in a wet shirt?

So, whether tis good or tripe....I shall order this and with the eager delight of a guilty pleasure watch a modern girl enter the pages of a beloved novel..and yes, kisses ....ardently so...with Mr. Darcy!

The only redeeming part of this movie was the character of Mr. Bennett, who happened to remain a constant.  I was excited to watch this, being an Austen enthusiast, but wish I could have my three hours returned to me.  I enjoy a good adaptation, but this was not one of them.  The main character was annoying to begin with and continued to worsen throughout the movie.  The soundtrack becomes burned on one's memory, with tendrils of smoke wafting through the air.  Many of the most witty lines are often rushed and mumbled so that you cannot understand them.  The plot was unbelievable and as the movie progressed, the characters would seemingly flip mid-stream as to their convictions.  My family and I all enjoy P&P and all of us feel betrayed by this farce.  We did find it rather fitting that the second portal between the two worlds happened to be a Port-a-Potty - and perhaps, this movie should remain there.

Jemima Rooper as Amanda has very funny lines and predicaments that she lands in that were extremely funny and from which she has to extricate herself with wit and hilarious results. She commands an excellent portrayal of her lovable character with candid comedic facial expressions that did me in. One must listen carefully to her 21st century mind trying to download into 19th century England. I loved the dialogue and particularly enjoyed Mr. Bennet's exasperated demeanor and humorous anecdotes about his life. All in all, the actors are all wonderful, and you will love Jemima Rooper's character.

Her clothes were way off the hook and the families acceptance of some strange, oddly  dressed stranger just appearing was unbeleiveable.  Plus her hair bothered me.  I am sorry but young unmarried women in that time did not go about with their hair down!

I really cannot express my level of disdain and discontentment when this movie ended.  I'm sorry, but changing the ending of Pride and Prejudice is unforgivable.  It wasn't the director or producers right to take away Elizabeth and Darcy's happy ending in favor of a stupid main character that the viewer wishes would disappear the entire movie.  Kudos to the supporting cast who did their best to act successfully around such a weak lead.  Please don't waste your time or energy (or money for that  matter) watching this video.

A bitter and cynical take on most of our favorite characters and vulgar language makes this film anything but attractive. It was all in very poor taste and I think that Miss Austen really is rolling over in her grave at the preposterous antics of the writers. It drug on for three hours and yet the audience is left with little understanding of these new characters posing under familiar names.,1241308800,36,505,4.5

This is the ultimate fantasy: girl hates her life, wishes for romance and adores Jane Austen, and somehow gets stuck in the novel herself. She is sucked into the daily life of the characters as they go through the events in the novel right from when Charles Bingly moved into Netherfield Park. Of course, this isn't real Austen. Our heroine does more damage than she intends, and Charles Bingly falls in love with her instead of Jane. Her actions totally throw the story of the novel out of sequence, leaving the audience to wonder how anything will ever be straightened out.

Ever since I first read Pride and Prejudice, I wished that I could be Elizabeth, and I thought of many different ways the novel could go. What if I could convince Mr. Collins to marry Mary Bennett? What if I managed to get Wickham to fall for Caroline Bingly? What if Charlotte Lucas married Colonel Fitzwilliam? There are so many different endings, and this is a wonderful way to imagine yourself in Elizabeth Bennett's shoes. I do hope they make more like this!

I am really surprised that so many people liked it.  It was terrible.  I rented it from Netflix because of the good reviews.  Where do I start with where it went wrong?  I don't mind if someone changes the story line a bit, but if it is supposed to be Austen's world, please, please retain the integrity, good character, wit and kindness of the main characters as well as the cultural norms of the time.  That is all lost.  Darcy is just plain mean.  Why Amanda likes her is a mystery.  Amanda is vulgar, unlikeable and a liar.  Why Darcy likes her is a mystery.  She also has this annoying habit of speaking in slang which must be used just in England, because I didn't understand some of the phrases she used.  I could tell enough by the context to know they weren't very nice.  Bingley is a drunk and unlikeable.  Georgiana is immoral.  Jane is weak, pathetic and willing to compromise her principles.  Elizabeth is absent.  Miss Bingley and Mr. Collins are changed from being just foolish and arrogant to being downright creepy and perverted. Ugh!  Can I say enough that it was terrible?

I wanted to love it so much that I bought the DVD from Amazon because it was a ""very long wait"" in my Netflix queue. However, I was a bit disappointed in the end. I understand that it takes a drastic turn from the Pride & Prejudice novel I know and love, but I totally get what it is trying to be. I just didn't find that I liked the main character or Mr. Darcy very much. I found humor in certain scenes (the wet shirt/lake scene was absolutely hilarious), but other scenes made me cringe a bit (the ""landing strip"" comment at the beginning for example). In general I feel that Lost in Austen is an interesting idea and look forward to another Lost in Austen which I hear is coming out in the next couple of years (hopefully Sense & Sensibility).

Going into details will give the whole story away, but if you are a true Austen fan (as I am), it's difficult to find anything to like in this movie.  The explanation for Amanda's presence/Elizabeth's disappearance is spurious, at best.  Mr. Darcy is borderline evil, and his and Amanda's attraction to each other is a complete mystery.  The only reason I gave it two stars is for the few humorous moments that can be found (for example, Amanda kneeing Mr. Collins in the groin - so satisfying!).  Other than that, it was way too long, and the point (if there even was one) was completely lost on me.  It's only redeeming feature is that it has served to remind me why I have consistently refused to read Austen sequels since that first horrible one many years ago.

Elizabeth in present-day England is something I've never wondered about, but I have thought of all the women in love with Colin Firth/Darcy wanting to go back in time. To before-Netherfield Derbyshire. Our heroine Amanda from present-day London is one of these. There is a scene where she asks this Darcy to go in the pond and get his shirt wet..... well. Hot and hysterical. Amanda tries to direct all the Austen characters in the way the book would go, but you'll have to check out the results yourself. It wasn't just a happy romantic or funny movie, I also caught myself feeling anxious for the outcome of the movie. Thus it became even more enjoyable, with tension in the plot that makes it great.",1240617600,2,791,4.617021276595745
3369404,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I have watched this ""mini-series"" now 4 times since receiving the DVD from Amazon immediately after its release and each time the production gets better and more brilliant. Excepting the few tiresome references to today's world of PC the writing is brilliant and very Austen-esque in style and therefore very believable. The casting was great, Mr & Mrs Bennett, great and I would say, regarding the Bennett sisters, they are the best to date, e.g., Jane,  Lydia, Kitty and Mary and although ""Lizzie"" had a fairly small part she would have been a great Elizabeth in any of the past P&P productions. I would have to say that Mr. Collins' character was a bit over the top and his ""habit"" detracted from an excellent script. Wickham seemed to be much more spot on had a Lydia/Wickham relationship developed in this ""what-if"" production. Also, Lady KDB, Mr. Bingley, sister Caroline Bingley and Charlotte Lucas all very well cast.

Mr. Darcy might be construed by some who view this production as a bit too harsh, but his character seemed to be more ""in character"" for the ""landed aristocracy"" of the period of English history being depicted and true to the novel, softens as the romantic interest develops.

Amanda, simply a great casting choice and a brilliant and believable performance!! Hope to see Ms. Rooper again.

I will say that the premise of this mini-series could not have been pulled off in any less than the 3 hours the DVD runs. However, be forewarned that there is heavy, if not total use, of ""hand-Held"" cameras which produce an annoying and distracting bobbing and weaving effect of the filmed image. Also, a minimum 5.1 audio track would have been nice to have.

All in all this production is a very well executed and respectable ""what if"" adaptation of Jane Austen's most famous novel and well worth the price to add to anyone's Jane Austen video collection. I highly recommend this DVD.

Oh, I too am disappointed that the scene in which Amanda sings ""Downtown"" has been cut. That edit creates  a huge continuity issue due to the several references to Amanda's singing ability later in the movie. I can only believe that leaving the scene in the DVD would have served to renew interest in an old, somewhat forgotten song and consequently renewed sales. So, the deletion of the scene results in the score movie fans 0, music retailers 0, lawyers 0, a no win for all involved. Badly done, badly done!!",1240617600,5,2416,4.76555023923445

My biggest complaint is that one of the best scenes from the original television airing is not included on this dvd.  After dinner with Darcy, Bingley and Miss Bingley, Amanda is asked to entertain them by singing a song.  She sings ""Downtown"" and it is so hilarious.  I was really disappointed that it was taken out.  You can catch the deleted scene on YouTube.  But if you don't mind great liberties taken with the original P&P you will enjoy this.

3369407,5,B0014T7ETQ,"The movie is about this chic (Amanda) who is a huge Pride and Prejudice fan. One night while reading, she hears a sound in her bathroom, only to walk in and discover Lizzy Bennett standing in her shower! Lizzy explains she came through a door in the wall (One which was originally home to pipes and such) but when they open it this time, you see into the upstairs of Longbourne! Amanda wanders in out of curiosity, and the door shuts. She's trapped in P&P, and Lizzy is in her world.

Amanda quickly learns she's essentially landed in the beginning of Pride and Prejudice with the arrival of Mr. Bingley in town. Amanda introduces herself as a friend of Lizzy's, saying they did a swap and Lizzy is at her house. The family takes her in, and she accompanies them through all of the events of the story.

Amanda desperately tries to communicate with Lizzy to get the door back open (Which has sealed itself). Due to the lack of Lizzy, much of the story is being altered. Characters are falling for the wrong people, events are changing, and much more. Amanda makes and effort to influence the story to keep in on track with the writings of Jane Austen, but is overwhelmed by how badly the story has gone awry.

I won't give away anymore! I will say this though- I laughed A LOT, and I loved the movie as a whole! It was 3 hours long, but worth every minute. What P&P fan hasn't fantasized about actually meeting Mr. Darcy??? I wish... How awesome would it be to read oneself into our favorite stories? Too cool!",1240358400,2,1510,4.424460431654676
3369408,4,B0014T7ETQ,"I'm a huge P&P/Jane Austen fan, and I enjoyed how the movie (directed by Dan Zeff) changed much of the plot and dialogue while still capturing the period flavor and wit of P&P (on at least one occasion it also recalls ""Emma""). I'm sure many of the female fans love the Darcy character, and the ""Colin Firth wet puffy pirate shirt"" scene (okay, it's not a puffy pirate shirt, but close enough), but for me, the wit of the movie is the charm; it captures much of the spirit of P&P without copying it, so that I found myself laughing often throughout the movie.

One caution is that if you are not familiar with 18th/19th century British culture and the Austen canon, you may not appreciate some of the humor.

I assume anyone reading this review is probably familiar with one or more of the P&P's on DVD, but my favorite is the BBC version with David Rintoul and Elizabeth Garvie, my favorite Darcy and Lizzie. I also liked the Keira Knightley version (Keira Knightley is one of my favorite actresses), although the 5-hour Colin Firth version is objectively even better. Also highly recommended is Bride & Prejudice (with Aishwarya Rai), the Indian takeoff of P&P which should not be missed if you like a good, fun spectacle with great music and dancing. Surprisingly, the 1940 version of P&P with Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson is probably the weakest of the major movie versions, although it is still quite entertaining. If you have seen one or more of these movies, or read P&P the novel, it should greatly enhance your enjoyment of Lost in Austen.

There was enough ""real"" Austen that you recognized the characters for who and what they were. Even when they deviated from the plot, it seemed to be quite in step with the way the characters had originally been written.  ****(spoiler alert) who couldn't believe it of Lizzie to want to head out on a big adventure in modern London ~ or that she would adapt very well once she found herself there?  To be honest, she was always way before her time in many ways.*****

Of course Darcy and Lizzy both were willing to do what ""duty"" called for -- but how much more fulfilling was the ending that was supplied.  There was also so much laughter and real affection between the characters (and who didn't love the water scene?)

I thought that this was just going to be my ""girl"" indulgence, but my husband and son actually joined me for the last two thirds of the movie and really liked it as well.  I am usually one who loves the idea of staying true to the book.  This is one of those examples that kept the spirit of the book - instead of the letter of the law (as it were.)

It was a wonderfully fun movie and I look forward to watching it again and again.",1240185600,3,1326,4.268
3369410,5,B0014T7ETQ,"This very modern spin on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is both brilliant and funny.  Jemima Rooper is a fiesty 21st century Austen fan who suddenly finds herself in the middle of her favorite novel. Her attempts to keep the plot of the novel on track are amusing and touching.  Elliot Cowan's Darcy seems a bit too stiff, even for Darcy. The supporting actors are all very good.  Much like Austen's own writing, the dialogue is fast and witty.

I am a long time Austen fan and love that this series does not hesitate to tweak and alter some of the core characters and events within the novel.  My favorite changes involve the ""truths"" about Wickham.  I've spoken to a few other Austen followers who don't like the liberties that ITV takes with characters and plot.  Some viewers might be shocked by an annuled marriage, references to lesbianism, and the radical alteration to the ending we've known and loved for two centuries.  I found the proposed annulment to be rather unbelievable, but I'm willing to suspend some reality in a movie that's already asked me to accept time travel into a fictional book.

I watched all four episodes straight through, and I'm going to buy the DVD.  If you're willing to watch some big changes to Austen's novel, I highly recommend this laugh-out-loud program.",1240185600,,1299,4.758928571428571

The modern woman through a fanciful plot twist has to substitute for Elizabeth Bennett.  This in its self could make an engaging alternative telling.  HOWEVER, this ploy is used to denigrate this classic novel.  The characters completely turn the plot on its head in an attempt to substitute late 20th Century liberal mores.  The movie has the modern character inform Mr. Bingley that Jane Bennett is a lesbian.  This completely ignores the perfectly valid customs and culture of the English country Folk of the early 1800s. It goes on to infuse Elizabeth Bennett with a modern ""career woman""  mentality. Even a cursory knowledge of Jane Austen's letters would refute the intentions sometimes ascribed by modern feminist Literature professors to this work.  Save your time and money, instead pick up A&E's ""Pride and Prejudice"". Better yet, savor once more Jane Austen's original novel.",1239840000,16,997,5.226415094339623
3369415,4,B0014T7ETQ,"Imagine that once upon a time in the early  21st century, a devout  ""Pride and Prejudice"" fanatic and unintentional time traveler named Amanda Price  wandered through the door behind her Hammersmith bathtub and switched places with Elizabeth Bennet, only to discover that most of the romantic principals in Austen's story were set on hooking themselves up with the wrong people.

Imagine, too, that while trying to fix this muddled mess, she inadvertently drove Bingley to drink, found herself engaged to Mr. Collins and just in the nick of time discovered a savior and ally in one of Austen's most despicable villains. Toss in assorted other wild and crazy contrivances, throw in a new variation on the famous Colin Firth wet shirt scene, cast the whole thing well nigh perfectly--with special  kudos for  Jemima Rooper as Amanda, Tom Riley as Wickham,  Lindsay Duncan as Lady Catherine, and Alex Kingston and Hugh Bonneville as the best pair of Bennet parents ever!--and wow!  What fun!

Warning: This wonderfully well imagined, over-the-top variation on one of literature's great classics  should not under any circumstances be critically compared with or considered a valid substitute for genuine Austen.

Austen purists will probably revile this witty adaptation/revision of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, but fans of Austen who aren't too particular and enjoy some liberties taken with Austen's works [in the interest of fun and entertainment] will find lots to enjoy in ITV's four-part series ""Lost in Austen"".

Jemima Rooper stars as Amanda Price, who is an avid fan of Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice and who yearns for the romance experienced by Darcy and Elizabeth. One day, she is flabbergasted to find Elizabeth Bennet[Gemma Arterton] herself facing her in her bathroom. Apparently, there is a 'magical' door through her bath wall that is able to transport Lizzie from Meryton to contemporary London. Before long, Amanda gleefully wanders through the portal into Lizzie's house with all its chaos, and life as Amanda knows it will never again be the same.

Amanda tries her best to get the other characters from P&P to follow through on the novel's plot, a situation made difficult by Lizzie's absence [glibly explained away as visiting Hammersmith, Amanda's home]. Mr Bingley in the meantime finds Amanda more interesting than Jane, and things get more complicated when Amanda meets Mr Darcy[a suitably brooding and haughty, yet drool-worthy Elliott Cowan]. Though Amanda finds Darcy interesting and attractive, his rudeness towards her is irksome, and the pair are soon engaged in witty verbal sparring.

The dialogue is part of what makes this production so entertaining. At one point, Jane is ill and ensconced in Bingley's country estate, and Darcy asks that Amanda leave. Bingley protests, saying 'She has paracetamols!' [paracetamol being the British equivalent of our Tylenol, or other fever-reducing medications]. There are lots of anachronisms in this series,which is to be expected given the two distinct time periods.

The cast is excellent - Alex Kingston [of ER] plays a very different Mrs Bennett, portraying a woman who has steely determination and can be downright nasty when she feels her interests threatened. Hugh Bonneville makes a livelier Mr Bennett than we are used to in the other adaptations. Guy Henry plays the greasy Mr Collins to a ""T"", and his performance actually made me shudder in revulsion. George Wickham's role here is quite surprising, with a twist in his story that was unexpected.

All in all, this is a fresh, revisionist approach to P&P, and though it does not follow the traditional plot of P&P, it is fun and entertaining, and with a mostly likable cast that carry this production through. Final verdict - fun and fresh, not to be taken too seriously.",1239062400,12,2853,5.021141649048626
3369419,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series, but its charms are probably best appreciated by Austen fans with a working knowledge of the Pride and Prejudice story. A lot of the fun of the series is seeing how the P & P plot is derailed when Elizabeth Bennett exits and modern-day Austen fan Amanda Price enters the 19th century world of Austen's novel. Although I am an ardent admirer of Colin Firth's Darcy, I think that Elliot Cowan acquits himself well in the role, and Jemima Rooper brings the right combination of insouciance and insecurity to her modern, fish-out-of-water heroine. At times, the execution is uneven. Amanda is often unnecessarily clumsy in her attempts to influence the other characters, and some of the resolutions seem contrived. Overall, though, I thought the series was ingenious and I was kept in suspense to the very end wondering how Amanda and Elizabeth would ""fix"" the perverted plot.",1238544000,6,905,4.9605263157894735
3369420,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I have seen this twice on Oxygen and each time I find something new and funny and wonderful about this remake of Pride and Prejudice.  While I love the Austen novels and feel that the Colin Firth version was quite close to the book, this one is so much fun! I can relate to Amanda when she says, ""every time I have been with someone, it was you (Darcy)..."" to paraphrase.  I know that I have longed for a modern man who could be more like Mr. Darcy, so I'm so glad that this was made.  If I can't find my own Mr. Darcy, at least I can revel in Amanda's escapades!  I hope you love this movie as much as I do!",1238371200,5,608,3.9186991869918697
3369421,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I finally bought my own copy and was disappointed that several things were left out, such as Amanda singing Downtown, one of my favorite parts of the series. I wonder why it was edited out?",1238284800,3,189,4.428571428571429
3369422,5,B0014T7ETQ,"What an entertaining tale! I found myself laughing at ""Amanda"", burning with embarrassment for her at times, and being completely GREEN with envy because she was doing what *I* have always wanted to do, ever since I first read ""Pride and Prejudice"" -- BE Elizabeth Bennett.
Mr. Cowan's performance as Mr. Darcy puts Mr. Firth's slightly wooden version to shame.  He has an exquisitely mobile face and piercing eyes, utilizing both to perfection when giving us a Mr. Darcy who is mannerly and elegant (that ""aristocratic languor"" Amanda speaks of) but inwardly passionate.  Sublime performance.  Very enjoyable and completely believable.
WELL worth the watch, more than once.  (Thank you, DVR. lol) Heartily recommended.",1238198400,7,719,5.336283185840708
3369423,2,B0014T7ETQ,"I caught some of this on tv recently, can't remember the net work.  I, myself, am an anglophile and die-hard Austen fan, and I have to say that this one wasn't worth the time I spent watching it.  I can see by the reviews that many have liked it.  My disappointment could be that anything other than the original work is a poor substitute.  I thought the story line was lacking, unbelievable, and boring.  Simply put, I thought it was pretty stupid.  I watched it for about an hour or so, and then switched to the gameshow network.  Even THAT was better than sitting through this awful awful movie.  I give it 2 stars, because the actors seemed to be very talented.  It's too bad that they now have to be forever associated with this piece of work.",1236729600,7,748,4.36231884057971
3369424,3,B0014T7ETQ,"I heard about this show and watched it online (sidereel.com) expecting to hate it, but I must admit that it sucked me in and forced me to watch it! Was it the handsome Elliot Cowan sizzling around as Darcy, the spunky if misguided heroine, or the unpredictable plot twists caused by a modern Austen fan bumbling through the world she'd only dreamed of? I can't be sure, but I have to say that I couldn't wait to see where the story would go next. Is it ridiculous? Absolutely. Will you feel foolish trying to describe it to your seriously literary friends? Believe it. Will you be embarrassingly hooked on it and want to see it again? Maybe. Whenever I engaged my brain I felt like I was watching some pretty crazy fan fiction, but nonetheless watch it I did. While some may find it a hack job that butchers their favorite book, it seemed to me more of a musing on the idea of what would it REALLY be like to be in this world so many of us like to read about. I will admit I wasn't crazy about the ending, but I don't want to put up a spoiler. So my final analysis is that I didn't really admire it but I did enjoy watching it. UPDATE: I ordered the dvd from Amazon and am pleased with my purchase. I did find the dvd at a local bookstore, but the price was double Amazon's, so I recommend getting it here, folks. The dvd contained two extras: an interesting ""making of"" feature and a trailer. I did notice that the dvd version was edited differently than the version I saw on sidereel, namely the loss of a scene where the heroine sings the 60's pop song ""Downtown."" That was a bummer. I can't say what else may be different, but apparently this version isn't exactly the same as what was broadcast in the UK. That being said, it's a good buy for a fun movie that comes in at about 3 hours, so that's two movie nights at my house! (The dvd version is not separated into episodes.)And the movie looks much lovelier on my tv than it did on my little computer screen. The colors and sets are very nice, and Elliot Cowan is a very handsome Darcy indeed!",1236038400,96,2050,4.245524296675192
3369425,5,B0014T7ETQ,"I first started hearing about this at a favorite fanfiction sight.  I ended up buying a Region 2 DVD from England and buying a multi-region DVD player just to satiate my curiousity. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. The premise of modern day Pride&Prejudice fanatic, Amanda, finding herself swapping places with Elizabeth Bennet is right out of a sci-fi, paranormal flick-- but once the story gets rolling in Regency England, the pace is fast and one better not blink!  The quick, cheeky conversations, and the twists & turns far flung from Jane Austen's original are entertaining and LOL funny. Elliot Cowen as Mr Darcy is outstanding. I think Jane Austen herself would have cast him! He had just the right amount of haughtiness, pride, arrogance, disdain, and finally tenderness.  He gave me chills when he gave Amanda a proper set down at Netherfield; so believable. The escape from Austen's usual canon was surprisingly refreshing and the play with characters was delightful. If you are expecting Austen's masterpiece P&P, this is not it. However, my Austenite sensibilities were not in anyway offended by this blatant & somewhat contrived story. Not wanting to give anymore away, let's just say that the entire ensemble was perfectly cast. It is all done in good humour and very  tongue-in-cheek. But I must admit that had I been in Amanda's shoes, I am certain I would have behaved better! And yes, I'll probably pre-order the Region 1 DVD, too!",1234656000,195,1441,4.966804979253112
3369426,5,B0014T7ETQ,"What a joy this was!  I am usually a P & P purist, and just watched it so I could be a watchdog and critique it.  Boy was I surprised.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, waiting to see what would happen next.  Elliot Cowan equals if not surpasses Colin as Darcy, and, well they are both great.  Just like I believe we can love the Colin P & P as well as the MacFadyen P & P, so too can we love this version.  We can love them all, as it is the story that we love, and these are merely different interpretations!  Jemima Rooper is a joy to behold; no one else could have pulled this tricky role off but her.  Please no one spoil the ending for those who have not seen it, but the ending to Lost in Austen is a big and wonderful surprise.  I personally would love to see a sequel in which we see how Lizzy is doing in her adventure.  Shh.  Don't give it away!!!  A delight.  PLEASE EVERYONE WRITE TO IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT (they are releasing the US version) and make sure they hear that we all will not be satisfied with a product that does not deliver the Downtown scene.  Strength in numbers so everyone please write, because word is, that it WILL be deleted from the US version, and we all know how crucial this scene is!!",1234310400,12,1232,4.037190082644628

There's a brilliant homage to it in one particular scene, which I didn't expect and just blew me away!

Also, you can catch the deleted scene where Amanda sings ""Downtown"" on YouTube, as well 5 behind the scenes clips. I read on the Amazon UK reviews that the ""Downtown"" scene was deleted from the UK dvd version as well, probably due to copyright issues.",1232236800,5,685,4.569105691056911

The late 2000s ""it"" girl Jemima Rooper stars as Amanda Price who is obsessed with P&P. Now I have to stop here.. look at her. Does she look like someone obsessed with Jane Austen? Nope. More like Pink. So one day, Amanda discovers a door in her home to the Bennett house and she and Elizabeth Bennett change worlds. Amanda now gets to live her favorite story for real. That is when it all goes to heck. First, Amanda makes zero effort to fit in and no one else seems to notice. She doesn't change her hair and she goes around kissing Bingley. If Darcy had problems with Lizzy no way could he ever tolerate this crass awkward fool. But yet, somehow at one point he falls in love with her. Then it makes the mistake all these shows do, instead of the character just being blunt with people they try to give them hints and end up failing miserably. Soon the story it taking all kinds of left turns that no one wants to see. Jane marries Collins, Wickham turns out to be a honorable guy and Georgiana is the scheming one.  There is just no wit or cleverness here. Just a large turd who mucks up the story badly. Why would anyone want to see that?",1510790400,3,1268,4.231404958677686

Not well known in the US but not to be missed! One you will watch multiple times!!
The six episode British series closely follows the 6 episodes of the classic British dramatization of Pride and Prejudice (with Collin Firth as Mr Darcy) with a few notable exceptions......
An Austin lover falls through her shower into the Bennet house while Elizabeth hightails it off into modern London. Which leaves a lot of questions like without Elizabeth playing matchmaker who will Mr Bingley marry? And how about Mr. Collins? The characters aren't acting the way they should - as you discover a hidden depth to characters that wasn't included in the book. Meanwhile, how to get Elizabeth back into her own story?
