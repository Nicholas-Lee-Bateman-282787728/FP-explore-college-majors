8545486,5,B009Z3PX0U,"Even though this is billed as a slapstick comedy, there are a lot of really smart jokes and subtle social commentary contained this film.  Loved it!",1474416000,,148,4.6923076923076925
8545487,3,B009Z3PX0U,Bought this because my grandson had a very small part in the movie and some of the filming was outside my office building.  Not the best movie ever but .....,1467072000,,157,4.233333333333333

8545490,5,B009Z3PX0U,"I watched The Whole Truth on a short domestic flight in India and it was just the perfect humor after a day trip.  The main character is so ridiculously over down it's brilliant.  I was laughing pretty loud and I'm a pretty good frequent flyer to my co-travelers but this was funny!  On a more serious note, I certainly left feeling like such a story line (won't give it away if you hopefully choose to watch it) is very likely happening all around us.  The truth does set you free.",1378166400,3,482,4.322222222222222
8545491,1,B009Z3PX0U,"This has got to be the worst movie ever created. I understand slapstick comedy but whomever wrote and directed this needs to be ashamed. Huge fan of all 3 stars...maybe it was a slow period for gigs for them, maybe they wanted to try something new or maybe they decided to stick with their commitment to this movie....I am trying to figure out why they would do it. Please note that it took years to get the movie out the door ...that speaks volumes. Please save your money and do NOT purchase this. Don't even bother with a bootleg version. smh",1368057600,2,545,4.405940594059406
8545492,5,B009Z3PX0U,I really enjoyed it - there's a lot more to this film than just laughs. It's satire and screwball with a little slapstick on the side.,1361664000,,134,4.1923076923076925
