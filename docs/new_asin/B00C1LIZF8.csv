5685379,5,B00C1LIZF8,"Lab Rats: Every Family Has Its Glitches is a 2013 Disney DVD compilation of the newest Disney XD sitcom. This DVD has seven episodes of the series that tells the tale of Leo(Tyrel Jackson Williams) and his mother Tasha(Angel Parker) moved in with Leo's step-father and Tasha's new husband Don Davenport(Hal Sparks, The Stepanie Miller Radio Show), a brilliant inventor who secretly has a trio of super-powerful cyborg teenagers, Adam(Spencer Boldman), Bree(Kelli Berglund), and Chase(Billy Unger). Each has an amazing meta-human ability. So when Leo learns of the trio, Don and Tasha needs to let Leo know it is a secret but it is really hard to keep the trio under wraps as they learn the life of a average teenager, with hilarious results. The DVD only has one special feature, and that is the sneak peeks of upcoming Disney DVD favourites like the Muppet Movie Anniversary Edition, The Little Mermaid, and Planes. Lab Rats is the best breakout Disney comedy any family will enjoy and it is perfect for fans of Hal Sparks!",1377734400,27,1024,4.890804597701149
