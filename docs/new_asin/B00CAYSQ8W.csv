5710196,5,B00CAYSQ8W,"I enjoyed this program.  It is a panel discussion with several members of the Young and the Restless cast, including Jeanne Cooper.  It must have been only a few months before she passed away. Also included are the actors that play Victor, Nikki, Phyllis, Nick, Neil, and Maria Bell.  They talk about different topics and take a few questions from the audience.",1389830400,,361,4.790322580645161

I was hoping Fire TV would make it possible to watch the daily airing in the evening.  Unfortunately I couldn't find that.

5710271,5,B00CAYSQ8W,"This is the only soap opera I watch.  I started watching it when I was thirteen with my sister.  Since I knew who the characters were, it just sort of stuck.  There were times when I would miss about a year or so for a while because there weren't any good story lines at the time, or my life would get busy, but I always come back.  I especially enjoyed their tribute to Jeanne Cooper.  I like the specials where the actors tell about things that happen behind the scenes.  I almost feel like I know the people on the show.  I would say the best years were in the eighties when Brad had the crazy ex-wife with the long beautiful hair, and Sheilas mother had aphasia and Victor was being poisoned with chocolates.  I liked the one where there was a gun in a big ice cube and it was set to shoot as the ice melted, but I think my favorite was the plastic surgeon that carved the word Murderer into the mans forehead, because I was guessing that when his faced was unveiled, it would be David Hasslehof returning to the show (since he told the plastic surgeon he wanted to look like him).",1401148800,6,1085,4.207729468599034
