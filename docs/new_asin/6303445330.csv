652304,5,6303445330,"I recently ordered this DVD. I was surprised when I found out that it had been released on DVD. You have no idea. I went nuts. I used to watch this over and over again when I was younger. My mother had bought a VHS copy of this at Wal Mart. Watched it all the time, and then it accidentally got sold at a yard sale. Don't know how that happened, but it did. Anyways, ever since then, I had always looked for a copy, but could never find one until now.

This is one of the best children's films ever produced, and the best claymation production ever...well, this and The Nightmare Before Christmas. It may look dated, but we have to remember that it WAS made in the '50s. Anna Russell still cracks me up as the voice of Rosina Rubylips, the witch. The entire vocal cast is excellent! I LOVE THIS FILM!

The only problem with the DVD is this: It looks as though someone took a VHS and transferred it over to a DVD. The sound isn't that great at times, either. Since this is the only version available at the moment, it will have to do. When (and if) they do finally remaster it and clean it up, I'll buy a new version of it. As of now, I'll settle with this one.

There is also a ten minute ""making of"" feature on here. Pretty interesting. If you grew up with this, and you love it like I do, buy it. I don't see any signs of a new DVD version coming out any time soon.",1171411200,6,1367,4.055555555555555
652305,4,6303445330,"This is not an opera, nor a cartoon version of an opera.

What it is, is an animated film of the story of Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel, presented in the style of Walt Disney's Fantasia.  The artists made little figures, with such amazing detail that it allows for facial expressions and movement, and then took more than 140,000 pictures of them to give them movement and life.  It makes for a very unusual presentation--neither cartoon nor real people.

It appeals to mainly two groups:  those looking for an introduction to the opera or story of Hansel and Gretel, and those interested in a movie like Disney's ""Fantasia.""

Oh, I should have said THREE groups:  there is also a growing interest in this as a camp movie (like the Rocky Horror Picture Show).  Most of this comes as a result of love for the great operatic comedienne, Anna Russell, who was in this production the delightfully camp voice of the witch, Rosina Rubylips.",1163635200,11,936,4.734567901234568
652306,5,6303445330,"Mother took me to see this film when I was a child.  Loved it then and I still do. Have been searching for this video a long time.  I have a German heritage.  This is one of my favorite fairy tales and favorite operas.  Learned to sing several of the arias.  Danced the part of one of the 14 angels and later the dew fairy in OKC productions of this opera.  Beautiful music performed in the opera comic style with singing and speaking.  Wonderful visuals.  Am preparing lesson plans which include this video and Bergmann's subtitled Magic Flute for a unit on opera. Unfortunately, this move  is not for everyone.  Today's audiences have been brought up on very shallow popular entertainment which is geared to the lowest common denominator.  This lovely little piece of video art requires some cognitive activity on the part of the viewer and an attention span of more than 20 minutes.",1151625600,8,885,4.645161290322581
652307,5,6303445330,"Takes you back to the early 60's watching this on WPIX Channel 11 as a TV special. It is nice to have for your collection, younger children may not enjoy it today.",1142035200,8,163,4.125
652308,3,6303445330,"This somewhat abridged version of the Opera offers a jewel of a translation by  celebrated poet Padraic Colum, a far cry more poetic and evocative than the German original. The puppets, a Czech develoment, got moved and reset 140,000 times between clicks of director Meyerberger's shutter. The effect's intriguing, the music's classic, the orchesta's first rate, the singing's skilled. I've seen and heard the orginal. It bids fair to be a legacy and any child's  happiest introduction to opera. But . . . .  It's not. This DVD didn't come from from a master, not even a first generation print. More likely a third or fourth level copy of a copy. The video suffers some but the sound stands just this side of obliteration. You can even hear the needle chatter of a vinyk record. It's too good a classic to lose this way. Go back and do it right.",1108598400,26,845,4.62
652309,4,6303445330,"If you've ever tried making your own animation using dolls or what-have-you, you may have found it an impossible trick to do at all, let alone well.  Imagine then, a feature-length film produced this way, one painstaking frame at a time, while keeping all the little nuances of character and charm. A Herculean task indeed.  But the producers of this film did exactly that.  There are moments when these doll-actors seem to live and breathe.
The characters are beautifully and beguilingly designed. Gretel and her mother look VERY much like ""Lost in Space"" actress June Lockhart, and the witch looks like an amalgamation of Carmen Miranda, Tallulah Bankhead, and Lucille Ball.  Anna Russell provides the campy, kooky witch voice, sung with operatic bravado.
Nice touches: at times the witch acts totally out of her mind, and surprisingly it makes her more convincing; Hansel is protective of his little sister, calming her when she's terrified and brushing dirt off her skirt. The father has a good singing voice and his optimism plays well against the mother's listlessness. For all her strictness, we can relate to her feelings of helplessness.
The visual backdrop to this story is a forest full of shadows and light, delightful and yet forboding. The entire film floats on the magnificent musical score by Humperdinck, and the lyrics to the music are very well translated.
Nowadays, films like ""Gone with the Wind"" get royal DVD treatment: they seek out and clean up the original camera negatives, correct any color problems and re-record the soundtrack digitally, cleaning up the noise.  I wonder if anyone knows where the camera negatives are for THIS film?  Think of the gorgeous DVD that they could make with this enchanting classic.  I saw this film about 4 times in a theater in 1966, and I remember it looking stunning.  This film deserves to ALWAYS look that great!",1078876800,6,1876,4.9712460063897765
652310,1,6303445330,"Don't buy it.  I have wonderful memories of seeing this film at the movies when I was a child.  I loved it so much that I even had the record album.  I couldn't wait to get it on DVD to share with my children.  What a disapointment!  It looks like the same print they showed in the theaters back in the early 1970s.  The colors are washed out and faded.  Even worse, the image looks soft.  I knew this was an old film and I wasn't expecting a ""Snow White"" quality restoration, but this was so bad that my family and I couldn't even finish watching it.
 The dismal quality becomes even more apparent when you watch the ""Making Of"" promo included on the disc.  Filmed in Black & White back in 1953, it looks crisper and sharper than the film itself.
 I knew I was in trouble, though, when I opened the DVD case and there wasn't a chapter list inside.  I sensed that if View Video (the distributor) didn't care enough about their product to include a chapter list, they wouldn't care about getting the best possible print (let alone striking a new one).  And I was right.
 Again, despite whatever fond memories you might have of this film, save your money.  Don't buy it.",1013731200,59,1168,4.317972350230415

652312,1,6303445330,"Purchasers who are looking for the ""real"" Hansel and Gretel by Humperdinck should NOT by this video.  This video is an adaptation which uses MOST of the music from the original but not all of it; and what IS  used is not always used in the original order.  This results in some  sections being recast in different keys; unexpected cuts; and other  anomalies (including some new vocal lines where there was previously just  orchestra).
The text is sung in English and the translation is very good  (almost word for word); but the concept is all wrong.  Very little is  actually sung:  Hansel and Gretel sing about 50% of their material; the  Mother sings none of it.  Major set pieces like the ""Children's  Prayer"" are spoken through with words that have nothing to do with the  original.
The casting and scripting suffer from their 1950s/60s style.  The worst offender in this is Constance Brigham's dual role as Hansel and  Gretel.  Gretel is portrayed as an airheaded giggler who is prissy, reacts  to all adversity by crying, and has no control over her emotions.  Hansel  is rude, treats adults with disdain and his sister with contempt.  (Just  watch any of the classic TV sitcoms produced around this time and you'll  see the same thing).  The fact that the father sings all of his lines (and  sings them well) and the mother speaks hers (when she isn't gasping or  crying out ""oh"") only further adds to the incongruity.
The only  thing that saves this performance from total disaster is the performance of  Anna Russell as the  Witch.  Even with all of the impediments previously  mentioned, this is the best performance of this role I have ever heard.  I  almost hate to say this, but the film is worth watching for her performance  alone.
But for those looking for an introduction to opera or those  familiar with it, be aware that this is a good film of its genre, but opera  it is NOT.",947376000,34,1896,4.63939393939394
652313,5,6303445330,"This version of the opera of Hansel and Gretel is accessible to children of all ages because it is visually intriguing.  Animated puppets, called the Kinemins by the producer back in 1954, are believable even though they  lack the sophistication of the movement seen in Toy Story.  The settings,  colorful, sometime frightening, and always imaginative, are perfectly  matched to the symphonic score of the opera and to the fanciful nature of  the story.  Of course, the witch is the centerpiece of the story, and Anna  Russell's incomparable interpretation of the witch both unnerves and  entertains at the same time.  She is obviously having fun--as is the witch  herself until her untimely demise in the oven.  I saw this film in a  theatre when I was only five years old, fell in love with the score as a  result, and have loved classical music ever since--thanks to Hansel and  Gretel.  I still cherise this film and recommend it to anyone with  children.  Actually, this film is delightful entertainment for people of  all ages.",944956800,42,1033,4.901162790697675

652529,5,6303445330,"I remember seeing this film a few times as a child probably in the late 1950s -- it was beautiful, really magical, with lovely music. Later, I saw the opera many times and realized that this little film hewed very closely to it in every way, including the ""staging."" Seeing this claymation -- or is it stop-motion? -- version after having purchased it, I was enchanted all over again. The ""puppets"" are sweet, really, the singing excellent. I could be wrong, but I remember reading somewhere that Padraic Colum wrote the screenplay.

652533,5,6303445330,"This sweet 1954 stop-animation feature is reminiscent of many such features I enjoyed in my childhood.
  Featuring the music of the famous  children's operetta  by Engelbert Humperdinck, Anna Russell leads the cast of vocalists as Rodina Rubylips, the witch who stalks  the innocent titular characters of the story.
 Hansel and Gretel, both vocalized by Constance Bingham live in a little  hut in the forest of the Harz Mountains of Germany. Their careworn mother(Mildred Dunnock) and broom salesman father(Frank Rogier) are away, and the two children, in the company of their pals, Susan, the goose, and Gingi the bear are shirking their household chores in favor of amusement , as children sometimes will.
 When their mother comes home, she shatters the pitcher containing cream, the only thing left for their supper in a fit of rage caused by the children's idleness.
 She sends them to gather strawberries in the woods, specifically in the Ilsenstein.
 Soon her husband comes home after a successful day of selling brooms, and there is now food to spare.
 But the children's father is horrified at the revelation of their being in the Ilsenstein because of the presence of the witch. Both parents immediately set off to find them.
 In the meantime, Hansel collects the strawberries in the darker areas of the forest and Gretel is happily diverted by picking wild flowers  and playing with Susan and Gingi.
 As it grows darker, the children regret having eaten the berries they were supposed to have brought home, and Gretel begins to have night terrors until a sweet little old sandman( Delbert Anderson)arrives.
 He makes the siblings sleep in a flower bed as they dream of angels amid beautiful vocalizing by the Apollo Boys' Choir.
 In the morning, amid the sound of the Dew Fairy(Helen Boatwright) they will discover the magical gingerbread house that leads to their fabled confrontation with the witch...
 60 years later, this beautiful and emotionally powerful production is still a joy to watch.",1415232000,,2006,5.067073170731708

It looks like someone took a handcam of a VCR tape playing a third-generation copy of the original. One day whoever owns the masters to this will hopefully put up the bucks to give a decent issue. I'm not talking an expensive restoration... unless the master tapes are a complete mess, it should be possible to get something watchable that's better than this mess.

Anna Russell as the witch is great, with her cackling and laughing until she snorts!

I must agree with several other reviewers that the quality of this particular company's dvd is not the best, but it appears to be the only version available. It isn't terrible, as some reviewers claim, however. Unfortunately, it appears to come down to a miss it or accept it situation. I had a VHS copy for years, so I went to Netflix and ordered a copy of this dvd just to see how bad the quality was before buying it. It's a bit fuzzy here and there, and it certainly would be wonderful if someone remastered it from the original, but saying it is unwatchable is going too far.

652693,2,6303445330,"The View Video edition of HANSEL AND GRETEL (alas, the only one available as of 2008) features a video transfer that looks suspiciously like a copy from a VHS master.  The overmodulated, fuzzy audio is no better.  In short, this DVD is very nearly unwatchable.  Only a few extras here, including a brief ""making-of"" short for 1950s television.

As for the film itself, it's an odd little curio but no masterpiece, certainly not as good as the Engelbert Humperdinck opera it's (loosely) based on.  The animation is generally lifeless and inexpressive, and the various attempts at cuteness come off as creepy.  But Anna Russell's spry turn as the Witch injects some much-needed vigor into the proceedings, and Irish poet Padraic Colum's translation of the German libretto is excellent -- when you can understand it.

RKO Pictures commissioned HANSEL AND GRETEL in 1954 as a low-budget alternative to Disney features -- a necessary move, since at the time the Disney studio was making plans to distribute its product through an in-house company.  The film was animated in sequence and rushed through production, which explains why earlier scenes are smoother than later ones.  It doesn't approach Disney caliber, on a technical or a narrative level.  Even though the film garnered some respectful reviews on its initial release, and seems to have performed adequately at the box office, RKO didn't care to repeat the experiment.",1212278400,4,1425,5.103448275862069

7847600,5,6303445330,"I'm an artist. But even if I wasn't, since I was a boy I always found this animated version fabulously creepy. For a film that was made some sixty years ago, the hand done animation rivals King Kong or Mighty Joe Young. You have to keep reminding yourself that the little stars aren't children, but animated puppets!",1486684800,4,316,4.56140350877193
7847601,2,6303445330,"Interesting stop-gap filming of dolls (rather than claymation).  The quality of the visuals is fair to poor.  The music track is also marginal.  The idea behind the program is more dramatic than musical, and its cuteness softens, probably too much, the story's harsh underpinnings.  I was disappointed in the video quality more than in the ""screenplay,"" but not all that happy with the latter, either.  Nevertheless, I am happy to have this in my collection as an interest item, but I doubt I will play it again.  I don't think it would appeal much to my great grandchildren, for that matter.  Maybe I'll try reading the story to them -- now there's a thought!",1481587200,,660,4.7368421052631575
7847602,5,6303445330,I use to watch this as a kid and I sill love it. I know some people are upset with the quality of the film but for me that's part of the charm.  Considering when it was made I think it's awesome and I am so glad to have a copy on dvd to share with my family and friends for years to come.,1473465600,2,288,3.5
