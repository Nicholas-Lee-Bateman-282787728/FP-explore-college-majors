It's tedious, not the least bit interesting, scary, funny, or ... anything. It's just a bland, banal tale of a dysfunctional family that somehow has a dummy thrown in. Cheesy camera angles, lame music, and run-of-the-mill dialogue and acting (though the lead actor has had some good performances in other films - don't get suckered in here). I can't get across strongly enough how lame this thing is.

Complete waste of time and money.",1452124800,20,673,4.743589743589744

7453454,2,B015XC8ABU,"Based on a true so this is not as good as CHUCKY which was based on ROBERT before it was made.

I am not going to insult you by even mentioning the plot...the boy likes the doll, mom is on meds and dad doubts both mom and the boy who may both be mentally unstable.

Robert lacks the charisma of Chucky. Suzie Frances Garton is not Catherine Hicks either. The sound is choppy in the beginning, something that they later fixed. The early kitchen scene has the shadow of the microphone on the wooden cabinet...yes I saw it Andrew Jones if you didn't or cared. And what was with the American Flag flying over the neighbors place outside of the window? Where was this filmed anyway? I don't believe the inside of the house was the same house we saw from the outside. Not that it's a bad thing, only when it is obvious.

Outside of that, ROBERT is another in a serious of stories where puppets or wooden dolls overpower adults 3-4 times their size. If you haven't seen one of these before, this one is not a bad flick. Unfortunately I don't know anyone who meets that description over the age of 5. There is a ""real story"" of Robert Eugene Otto on Wikipedia. Acting could have been better too.

Also of course no one else knows about it except for the obviously distraught wife (who of course has psychological issues and her logic can't be trusted, duh) and the husband who never knows until it's too late and takes a baseball bat to the head courtesy of creepy doll. The only thing that was a surprise was the ending where the director completely  ripped off Halloween 4 and the seemingly innocent kid becomes the new killer because his pops single handedly killed the doll by majestically throwing a knife at it. This movie took a very non original idea, added some cheaply done low budget effects, sprinkled in some s*** acting and then took people's money so that these people could watch this regrettable cinematic disappointment.",1456617600,,958,4.505747126436781

Okay, let me just start by saying that I grew up in the early 90s when the kill doll craze was in its prime. We had Childs Play, Dolly Dearest, and the master of the genre, Charles Band was bringing out Puppet Master, Demonic Toys, Dolls, etc. I remember rewinding Oh Goody, were going for a ride numerous times on my Dolly Dearest tape. Now were over 20 years later and with the Conjuring it looks like the doll flicks are making their comeback. Charles Band has brought Blade back, Don Mancini gave us a terrific Childs Play sequel, and Annabelle was a box office hit! How do Robert stack up to the pros? Well, lets begin.

***Spoilers Below***

Our movie starts with a disgruntled nanny, Agatha (Judith Haley) who has just been fired from her job. She decides to end her stay with a parting gift for young Gene (Flynn Allen) but this doll isn't just a toy, hes more, something evil, something hellbent on destroying this young family. When Genes mother finds the new house guest she isn't too fond of him, threatening to place him in the attic until Gene steps up. Night falls, mom decides to go for a drink and there is literally a 5 minute suspense scene of her walking throughout the house with the most bland suspense music Ive ever heard. The big pay off? The Doll is in the chair! As the film trickles along, things start happening, is it Gene, or is it Robert? Watch until the endIf you dare!

*End Spoilers*

Okay, first things first, I have to get this off my chest. Is it just me or does Robert look like a rejected Glen doll from Seed of Chucky mixed with an Annabelle doll? Hes designed to be scary, he looks terrifying all in all. Like I said during the beginning of this review, I was a major fan of most killer toy flicks of the 80s-90s. As this one starts off it seems to meld into the Childs Play type flick without any of the scares or building suspense. As we dig further into the flick I start to get a sense that the boy is showing his emotions through Robert like the young girl in Pinicchios Revenge. As far as acting goes, our mother Jen (Suzie Garton) is about as bad as they come, when shes not overreacting, shes as stiff as a board! I know the mother is written in a way that shes depressed, she plays the part well, but I cant tell if its acting or if shes just bored. Our father Paul (Flynn Allen) is about as wooden as they come, when he briefly appears on screen hes literally falling asleep as he attempts to read his lines. Martha, the new nanny is easily the most talented of this crew, she shows emotion, and is genuinely scared of Robert. Gene, the young boy is someone I just cant gauge, hes barely in the movie, and when he is, hes usually in bed or begging his mum to keep Robert out of the basement.

Final Thoughts

You know what this movie lacks? The subtle queues that keep us entertained. There is little to  no backstory to Robert that makes us want to cheer him on, hes about as bland as they come when it comes to our killer dolls. If you're going to make a male Annabelle clone, atleast have the guts to give us some history on the doll! If hes going to look as scary as he does, the movie itself has to mimic what were seeing with our eyes. I was insanely bored with this flick, nothing happens with the first half of the movie and when Robert does start to do his damage, its blatently obvious that the filmmakers didn't have enough money to utilize the doll in a way that most would have enjoyed. The final minutes of the movie see mom playing as detective and Robert playing in the trees, the build up to our grand finale is looking dim. I know that the UK is giving us grand flicks, like The Babadook, but after seeing this one, I recommend avoiding it at all costs. Is it worth a RedBox rental? No! Is it worth the risk of getting caught illegally downloading it? No! The movie has no heart, its as bland as can be and literally put many to sleep who was watching with me. The finale? Dont wait for it, its not worth it.",1454803200,8,4060,4.25
