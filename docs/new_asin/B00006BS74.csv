But this is the ONLY DVD of the original group playing live, so I cherish it.  These guys were incredibly tight playing live, and I love their music, especially from the earlier years with all four original members.  So, if you are a Barclay James Harvest fan, then this DVD will be your only chance to hear the original group play live, unless you were fortunate to have heard them back in those days.",1457913600,,542,4.5

7966901,1,B00006BS74,"Unfortunately the quality of this DVD is sooo Bad... the sound could not be any worse, and since these guys are not that great to look at anyhow, why bother? I don't see any qualities for anybody to enjoy...so spend your money on their CDs...",1048118400,4,242,4.4
