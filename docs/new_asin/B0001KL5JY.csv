2010559,5,B0001KL5JY,This Profiler series is well worth the money spent. I enjoyed the weekly program when it was on t.v. and was pleased to find the season on dvd. Two to three times a month I will pull out the collection and watch at least one of the titles on the dvd series. It never gets old to me.,1208217600,,282,3.8793103448275863
2010560,3,B0001KL5JY,"Chloe ages with no explanation. Angel all but disappears. They out right copy ""Silence of the Lambs"" after ""Jack s captured, even to the point of stealing a line right from the movie. Sam remians insecure and unable to carry on an adult conversation. Malone's daughter disappers after we have watched two seasons of family struggles.",1190419200,2,333,4.964285714285714
2010561,4,B0001KL5JY,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this show.... it's amazing. However, it turned in the season. Instead of the dark lighting, wardrobe, and intriguing way we were seeing things as they developed in the first two seasons.... now we're stuck with the ""lightened"" version, and now we know who the killer is in the first 10 minutes. We see much less of Sam and the VCTF agents, and much more of the killer and their lives.... it takes the fun out of it. We used to be kept in suspense until the last moments of the show, as we figured things out as Sam was.... not only that, but she lost some of her brilliance and perceptiveness, and falls for alot of things that season 1 and 2 sam wouldn't have.. ****SPOILER**** i.e. in Otis, California when we meet the sherriff, and it's blatantly obvious that his voice is the same as Jack's..... Sam would've known his voice the second she heard it... but anyway, yeah it lost its appeal, but I still love it because Ally Walker is amazing in this show.",1139184000,12,974,4.386740331491713
2010562,5,B0001KL5JY,"Much darker than almost any series you'll ever watch and Ally walker, robert davi, and the rest of the cast are perfectly cast.  I just wish it would have stayed on longer than it did.",1081814400,5,184,4.257142857142857
2010563,2,B0001KL5JY,"I ordered this DVD set with great excitement. I waited VERY impatiently for it to arrive. When it finally did I tore open the box and happily placed the first disc into my DVD player. That's when my emotions hit rock bottom. None of the episodes are captioned, that's bad news to a deaf t.v. junkie. The fact had not even entered my mind that they wouldn't be captioned so it was a great shock to me. The television shows are all captioned, all the several t.v. shows I own on DVD are all captioned. Why would such a well know distributor of fine shows like A&E release a show without captioning it? They are the final losers though. Take a look at the percentage of deaf and hearing impaired in our nation. A&E are shooting themselves in the foot by not making it available to those hundreds of thousands. Yes, not just a few, a multitude.",1080777600,37,840,4.356687898089172

8013908,1,B0001KL5JY,"I bought this for the above reason and that particular episode was of considerable interest. However, the concept of the programme is so lame that I am amazed that it reached a 3rd series and gave James Franco a chance.",1361750400,,219,4.5
8013909,1,B0001KL5JY,"I ordered Profiler, Seasons 3 and 4.  I received the package in the mail today.  Instead of the items that I ordered, I received 2 used library books.  Amazon sent me a return label for the items (the library books!) so that I could send them back to receive a refund.  Fingers crossed that I receive the refund!",1343779200,,312,4.327586206896552
8013910,3,B0001KL5JY,"SPOILER ALERT:

Season 3 of Profiler immediately started out as a terrible disappointment because of the ""capture"" of Jack-of-all-Trades, an integral character to the series.  I lost interest once Jack was arrested, but not for just the obvious reason that many of the first two seasons' shows centered on him, but because it was clear that the Jack who was caught was not the same Jack we had been treated to from the beginning of the series.  I was upset that TPTB in this show thought we as viewers to were too dim to realize that whoever that guy was, he was not Jack.  Moreover, the delightful little girl who played Chloe was recast an older, less interesting actress with no explanation given, we also saw the essential elimination of the character of Angel, Sam's best friend from childhood, and the person who had been living with her since the death of Sam's husband.  Although the writers corrected the Jack problem towards  the end of the season, IMHO, it was too little too late, because the faux capture wound up making Sam and the rest of her team look like fools for not realizing what we the audience knew -- that whoever they had caughat, it was not Jack.  While I don't know if this change in story was a result of a dispute with the actor who played Jack, the dawning that the audience was not fooled, or the realization that Ally was leaving and a possbile long-term plan had to be altered, the show was effectively done in with the first few episodes of the season.",1258243200,,1487,4.526119402985074
