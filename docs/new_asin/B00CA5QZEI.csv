5708992,1,B00CA5QZEI,"Kevin.  How can you write a review on a  DVD that is not even out yet.  I too have been waiting for this DVD since 2013 only to see the release date put back more times than I can remember.  This time it looks like it might actually  release being only two more days from now.
Since the release has been put back for at least two Christmases maybe my husband can finally get this for Valentines day.
Keep your fingers crossed everyone!",1421971200,4,435,4.192771084337349
5708993,2,B00CA5QZEI,"I have had this 3D DVD on pre-order since March 2013. So, 23 months of release postponements, I'm playing a game as well as others. But I look forward to getting this DVD some day. The other 3D Media have been worth the wait. However, the current delay represents 10% of my life expectancy from almost 2 years ago.",1410307200,8,314,4.338983050847458
5708994,1,B00CA5QZEI,"Super boring and the 3D is not impressive.  Waste of money.  You would expect a lot of exciting helicopter angles that would *pop* on 3D, but nope.",1385856000,16,147,4.407407407407407

8579101,1,B00CA5QZEI,"For the price, it was just ok.  Too much of the scenery was from only a couple of locations.  Because the 3d had nothing in the forefront, it didn't even look 3D.  There were helicopter shots that were not even HD, so they were distracting.  We love Grand Canyon and go there several times a year.  This movie did it an injustice.  I would not recommend it.",1459728000,,357,4.253731343283582
8579102,1,B00CA5QZEI,"This feature not only lacks substance (explaining the geological structure of the base of the canyon while showing images of the rim), but the photography is worse than amateur.
Picture this: shots that are washed out that look like still photographs but aren't, and when they finally show motion the film looks like it was shot in 8mm and last less than a few seconds.
This IS a budget 3D Bluray but even if it was just a regular documentary it lacks cohesiveness as well professional photography (and videography).
Absolutely DO NOT buy this feature.",1455148800,,552,4.821052631578947

8579104,1,B00CA5QZEI,Repetitions of the same scene. Poor value.,1441152000,,42,5.142857142857143
8579105,2,B00CA5QZEI,"A bit amateurish. Same scene filmed repeatedly - wide, zoom a little, zoom in more, zoom in some more, pan 30 degrees, repeat. The narration often didn't match the scene. Any 3D effects were almost unnoticeable.",1439424000,,211,4.888888888888889
8579106,1,B00CA5QZEI,"After waiting months for the release, was very disappointed in the results. Instead of the camera actually moving, it would just sit in one spot for an amount of time then, show another spot. There was no motion except for an occasional bird flying by. When the camera did move the picture looked like an old 16mm film not high digital. The camera movement was very seldom most of the time it just stayed stationary on one scene. The most annoying part was that it kept showing the same scene over and over again. I counted one scene repeated 10 times. I did not find the DVD very interesting and got tired of watching after 20 minutes of the 60 minute video. I would not buy this DVD again nor recommend it to anyone.",1433721600,3,718,4.365671641791045

8579108,2,B00CA5QZEI,"Ordered July 2013 - Delivered May 2015. Packaging states ""Real 3D (3D Blu-Ray and 2D Blu-Ray)"". On startup, movie defaults to 3D with no way to  select 2D. One very long hour of repetitive video and still shots taken from locations around the rim. Many of the same scenes are from the same location, just taken from a slightly different angle and / or cropped or zoomed differently - over and over again. Ack!

There are no images from down in the canyon itself. The back of the package shows a waterfall, horses, etc. The only animals in the video were ravens in a few shots.  The very short Slide Show simply repeats a few stills from the movie.

The 3D effect is by far the worst we have seen. It just doesn't look right on our StudioTek 130 110"" screen, using a Sony HW40ES PJ and Sony PS3 glasses. The video is consistently washed out and the few blurry airborne shots are definitely not even HD.

Giving it two stars for the very good (sparse) narration, the interesting geological information and the decent background music.

We will not watch this movie again and will probably not waste the time to return it to Amazon for $9.89.",1430956800,5,1139,4.478260869565218
