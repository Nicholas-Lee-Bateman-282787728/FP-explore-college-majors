1879190,4,B0000950W1,I was getting ready for my first trip to Holland and wanted to watch something in Dutch.  I enjoyed this well enough and would recommend it.  It may be my American sensibilities but I thought it needed some editing to tighten up the story a bit but it does depict regular Dutch people living their lives which I found interesting.,1373155200,,330,4.483333333333333
1879191,3,B0000950W1,"I really liked the movie. It was cute, but the sisters and their relationships were a bit difficult to follow. It moved pretty fast, and for me personally, watching it on my computer screen made it hard to keep up with the visual AND the English subtitles.",1367625600,,256,4.468085106382978
1879192,1,B0000950W1,This movie was hard to watch and did not complete watching it.  IT was subtitled in English. Was hard to read the subtitles and therefore did not watch the movie entirely.,1367366400,,171,4.516129032258065
1879193,2,B0000950W1,"I don't mind quirky, but I need to feel some sympathy or interest in the characters. Couldn't find that here even by the half way point. Boring movie.",1360454400,,150,4.392857142857143
1879194,3,B0000950W1,"Halina Reijn is a wonderful actress, so I bought the film.  However this movie genre is not my favorite.  I didn't find the movie particularly funny, nor scandalous.  I would watch the movie again though.",1230249600,,204,4.771428571428571
1879195,2,B0000950W1,"Back when I was considering a move to Holland or Belgium and was immersing myself in the Dutch language, I got my hands on this film, hoping for the best.  Generally, I have enjoyed Dutch cinema, so this was actually quite disappointing. It is not that this was a terrible film; the story was actually fairly interesting. A group of busy, very different sisters conspire to sabotage their brother's upcoming nuptials in order to safeguard a family property (he will inherit it if he marries). Having believed for years that the property was safe (because the brother was widely perceived to be gay) the sisters are shocked and band together, despite their very obvious and frequent differences. Overall not a one of the characters here is very likeable, and though I applaud films that take a candid look at real people with real personalities (likeable or not), this one just rubbed me the wrong way. It's watchable but not great by any means.",1110585600,7,944,4.791411042944786
1879196,5,B0000950W1,"Three witch-like sisters, One annoyed little-gay-brother fighting for independence, a beautiful bride and two very special husbands (the witches's), all wrapped up with the best showcase of dutch culture and way of life. Two best things: The simplicity of the script, always going straightforward to the bottom of the topic: a simple story on a complex society; and a beautiful portrait of everyday's life. If you've been around these wonderful nation, you'll love this movie, otherwise, keep always in mind that dutches live some years ahead of the rest of the world. I loved Sarah Bettens on the closing credits.",1098230400,4,614,5.15
1879197,4,B0000950W1,"Three sisters are in a predicament about their beloved gay brother, Nino, who has decided to marry a woman.  Nino has also decided to sell the family hotel Paraiso which is located in Portugal, and this upsets the sisters as it is a haven of family memories.  The marriage is planned to take place within three weeks at the family hotel, which gives the sisters a very limited time to find a way to sabotage the wedding as they want to keep the hotel in family.  In the quest for sabotaging the marriage the sister's own relationships undergo revelations.  Zus & Zo is a fun drama that offers both entertainment and thought, which in the end provides a good cinematic experience.",1080691200,4,679,4.586776859504132
1879198,3,B0000950W1,"While Zus & Zo is not a movie that will make you laugh out loud or cause a downfall of tears it is a mildly touching and quietly entertaining portrait of life.  It is an interesting and at times smirk-inspiring film, but with an all-to-tight ending that leaves too many questions about the future.  The acting is fine and the cinematography is unobtrusive, but the emotional connections are few and far between.  Once you begin to identify with a character, they are ripped away from you by an evil act, or quick phrase that turns your stomach.  A beautiful montage, a great song over the closing credits (Sarah Bettens' ""Someone to Say Hi To"") are not enough to lift this movie to the heights of top ten lists for the year.  This Acadamy Award Nominee, deserves a look, but for most one will be enough.  My advise: Rent before you Buy.",1060473600,6,836,4.503311258278146
7989428,3,B0000950W1,it was just ok.  i did however feel like i needed to go get my eyes checked looking at this fuzzy movie.,1468454400,,104,3.727272727272727

7989430,5,B0000950W1,Love this window into this non traditional Dutch family who love each other and the travails of sibling rivalry.,1455580800,,112,4.947368421052632
7989431,1,B0000950W1,Hard to watched like an old damaged VHS tape.,1436745600,,45,4.111111111111111

7989433,4,B0000950W1,Love a happy ending.  Though the subtitles were a little tough for me it was still enjoyable.,1422144000,,93,4.470588235294118
7989434,2,B0000950W1,"The subtitles do not keep up with the video so unless you're a native speaker, it's very choppy and broken.",1410912000,,107,4.4
7989435,1,B0000950W1,"Got tired of reading the subtitles, pretty boring anyway.. I find most of the foreign films long and no action. I never finished the film.",1386806400,,138,4.56
7989436,5,B0000950W1,"I loved this movie. I think most of the bad reviews are due to the other viewer's inability to step out of their own culture enough to even understand the comedy. Conclusion, if you are a parochial American, don't watch this film.  If you have a sense of adventure? You will love it.",1379116800,,283,4.339622641509434
7989437,3,B0000950W1,"I managed to make it all the way through to the end, but it was tough. None of the characters were sympathetic, and it was tough to stay interested in their story. I'm not sorry I watched the film, but can't recommend it.",1375747200,,221,4.162790697674419
