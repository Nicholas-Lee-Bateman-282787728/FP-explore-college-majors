8430842,5,B004ILO91S,"Temple Grandin thoroughly explains how Autism affects a person's life.  She explains what parents can expect with an Autistic child.  This video was the first time that I have ever heard ""people with Autism"" be referred to as ""Autists"".  Temple Grandin's advice is always good to hear.  I especially liked her advice to be sure and get your children vaccinated against diseases.  Then Temple Grandin adds that giving some vaccines to children at a later date, after their brains have more fully formed, might be one way to combat your child's developing autism.  I don't know if that would help any, but it is an interesting thought!",1337385600,9,633,4.869158878504673

8430844,5,B004ILO91S,This documentarty is a must see for anyone that is affected by autism.  I am a parent of an autistic child.  He was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrom.  There were times while watching the interview that I just slapped my forehead and asked myself why I never thought of that!  The flip side of the film was being able to see a person on the spectrum living in the real world and being successful doing so.,1299801600,32,405,4.36
