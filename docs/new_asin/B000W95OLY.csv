8221851,1,B000W95OLY,Old movie bad copy.  Couldn't hear or see it very well.  Didn't seem to follow the book from what I could tell.  One of my favorite stories.,1486425600,,140,4.111111111111111
8221852,1,B000W95OLY,"There was no subtitle option, so the fact that I could barely understand the dialog in most places in the film, and at some points not at all, was not of any help. I am a big Hitchcock fan, but regret this purchase.  I tried watching the first 20 minutes, and then skipped to all the chapter beginnings, and it seemed the same throughout with some spots where the dialog was Ok.  Also a factor is the fact that the characters are speaking in dialect, and I am a Yank.  This is not a problem for me in his other films.",1486252800,,517,4.099009900990099
8221853,5,B000W95OLY,"JAMAICA INN from 1939 was Alfred Hitchcock's last directorial effort from his ""British Period"" before coming to America to direct REBECCA for David O. Selznick. Interestingly both films are based on Daphne Du Maurier novels. A costume period piece JAMAICA INN attracted Hitchcock because of the Du Maurier angle which would prep him for REBECCA. Alfred Hitchcock was never enamored with costume pieces as he latter admitted to Franois Truffaut in their famous discussions when refereeing to his ill made choice to direct UNDER CAPRICORN.

Sidney Gilliat and Joan Harrison's screenplay based on Du Maurier's novel seems more conventional and less gothic, if that is an appropriate categorization, than Du Maurier's protraction of her story. This straight forward approach seems to work well for Maureen O'Hara, Charles Laughton and Robert Newton and their roles making the film more intriguing and beguiling and less atmospheric. In all this is a thoroughly entertaining film if somewhat atypical Hitchcock.",1415059200,3,1006,5.448717948717949
