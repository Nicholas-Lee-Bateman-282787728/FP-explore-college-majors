6479511,4,B00LC4VNYK,"The Sugarfoot and Bronco Western series were moved in temporarily to replace the Cheyenne series when Clint Walker had a dispute with Warner Brothers studio.  The Bronco series was not very good, but The Sugarfoot series was well done, due to the boyish charm of Will Hutchins as the lead character.  It is interesting to see a hero who chooses a law book instead of a gun, and is no match physically for the big, bad guys.  The stories are interesting, as Tom Brewster, the main character, uses his wits and likeability to solve the problems he encounters each week.",1412985600,7,567,4.65
6479512,5,B00LC4VNYK,"Sugarfoot together with Cheyenne, Maverick and Bronco were standard fare each Saturday night at our house. Great to see 'em again.",1410480000,3,130,5.238095238095238
6479513,5,B00LC4VNYK,"The old Warner Bros westerns are all very good, and Sugarfoot is no exception.  A very good series especially for those of us who grew up during those years.  If WB would release others like 77Sunset Strip, Hawaiian Eye, The Roaring 20's and Surfside 6, I would look forward to purchasing those also.",1410220800,7,300,4.6415094339622645

8665157,5,B00LC4VNYK,"Sugarfoot was nothing like Cheyenne.

It could be debated that Sugarfoot was the opposite of the character of Cheyenne.  Clint Walkers Cheyenne was large, tall, rugged, and was fast to use a gun, never without provocation.  He was the quiet, loner cowboy whereas Will Hutchins Sugarfoot was rooted in Will Rogers and Jimmy Stewart as Destry.

Sugarfoot is the would-be pacifist hero as opposed to Cheyenne, the shoot quick and stay alive hero.

Watching these Sugarfoot  Season 3 episodes, I had not recalled how effective Will Hutchins was in the role.  He is extremely likeable, a quick, easy, genuine smile but able to showcase a steely strength when situations turn dark and hostile.

The show often does have him refrain from solving problems with a gun.

Warners casting people really had a sharp eye for talent and an understanding of the type of actor needed for a title role.  It shows in so many of their titles from that time period.

With the first episode of the Season 3, Sugarfoot starts a guest star list that won't only invest in continuity from previous Sugarfoot seasons, or with cameos from characters in other Warner TV series, but the show will also feature guest stars famous for iconic roles in other shows on the air in the late 50s, from non Western genres encompassing some of the best contemporary dramas of the time to sit-com favorites.
One might even see Batman as Doc Holiday.
