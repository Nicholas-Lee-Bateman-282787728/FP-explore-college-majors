6440445,2,B00KQJRZ8U,Depressing. An overload of poverty without end. If this film doesn't convince you that something is rotten in the us&a then nothing will. Billions of $ for things that kill. In this rich rich country we have robbed the many to fatten the few. A stunning example of how capitalism grinds poor folks even further down into hopelessness.,1407542400,3,334,4.775862068965517

6440449,5,B00KQJRZ8U,This is what is happening to America.  The middle class is becoming much like these people.  Our politicians setup trade agreements that an idiot would do better.  We are a importing country now.  We used to make everything here.  Now greed and immoral people move their company to a third world country that leaves no jobs and hopelessness for people.  Yes these kids don't care of an education.  They have no one to prove to them that any of it works.  I went to school.  I served in the Military.  I got a degree.  Here I sit for the last 8 months with no job.  With thousands of applications I have sent online.  All my training and education is doing nothing for me.  I am about to lose my home.

6440453,1,B00KQJRZ8U,"I really don't get why this is considered one of the top docs of 2014. There is no narration...there is no hints as to what story is attempting to be told. As someone who grew up in rural Kentucky, I feel like I am watching a clumbsily spliced together presentation of people's home videos. There is no story arc.

6440461,5,B00KQJRZ8U,"This has been pigeonholed as a ""documentary,"" probably because there's no category into which it would fit.  Rich Hill is a beautiful video essay containing no narration, its characters tell their own stories.  What is astounding is how this film is edited into a cohesive whole, it clearly is shot over a period of many months (years?) but the scenes flow together seamlessly.  When you see the credits roll it's easy to understand the complexity of this effort.  Watch it once, and you'll want it permanently added to your library.  A magnificent effort.",1428796800,,556,4.935483870967742
6440462,2,B00KQJRZ8U,"I'm as open as the next person to understand the plight of the poor, what it ""looks"" like and the why and wherefore that leads someone to such a place. But I agree with others that this film does not enlighten on that score -- rather, it confuses the picture with details it never explains. What drug is the mom taking? Where's the dad? Why is the place filthy? Which kids are whose? While I appreciate the up-close and personal portrait of the three boys I don't believe it would have violated this intimacy by having their stories put in context. Let's hear from the doctors treating Harley, Andrew's mother or Appachey. Let's get some background from the principal, teachers, family members outside the homes, from the prosecutors or defense lawyers. Why not talk to others in the town? I witness a mother hitting her son, a son hitting his sister, a mother lost in a fog of some drug, a dad out of touch with reality -- at least Andrew has a dad -- and an overwhelmed grandmother. There's nothing here that could be solved by gobs of money. As one reviewer said, give these families each a million and they'd still have the same issues that would lead them right back to the pit they're in. (In fact, I thought Appachey's mom and the woman in ""The Queen of Versailles"" had a lot in common.) This movie made me angry but not at a society that's forgotten these kids and their families -- it makes me mad at the choices parents make and their inability or unwillingness to pass along any wisdom of their life experiences to their kids. And I'm not a little mad at the filmmakers who, as another reviewer put it, mistake access for intimacy. It's not enough to look at a mess. To bring about real change, you have to understand the mess. Rich Hill did not help me understand poverty in America.",1427932800,6,1795,4.458966565349544
6440463,4,B00KQJRZ8U,"Rich Hill's film makers wisely chose to shine a tentative beam of hope onto the youngsters in the documentary rather than focusing too heavily on their parents.  Hope has roots, and dreams can take flight when they exist in a young person, regardless of the foregone conclusions perpetuated by ""cycle of poverty"" statistics.

Andrew Jewell represented a fine example of what is possible with the right attitude. Despite his father's ""rolling stone"" lifestyle, I was struck by the cleanliness and orderliness of the Jewell home.  Granted, the house held few belongings (moving every six months can do wonders for eliminating clutter), but the family appeared to adhere to a  daily routine that could only serve to benefit their childrens character. That labor-intensive bath, for instance, seemed to suggest that the parents had instilled some self discipline in their kids.  Although poor, Andrew always looked clean, neat and well groomed.  He also demonstrated the discipline required to work out, a reflection of his healthy sense of self pride. From what I later read about Andrew, not too long after filming ended he moved out of the family home and into a small trailer by himself, while continuing his education.

With respect to Harley, I thought I detected in him more than a flicker of promise.  Besides his endearing personality, the boy came across as intelligent and insightful.  He also possessed a sparkling sense of humor despite the abuse in his past. It's possible he could avoid a bare-bones adult life if his grandmother stays committed to seeing him well into young adulthood.

I felt most concerned for poor Apachee and his mother.  No, the house would not qualify for the pages of ""Better Homes and Gardens,"" but this downtrodden woman has obviously circled down to the nadir of despair that defined her perception of self.  This is her life, she implies, the only one she has ever known, and the only one she will have on this earth. Her complacency and resignation over her situation casts a dark cloud on Apachees future.

Finally, it would have been interesting to hear a bit more about Andrew's mother's issues but, as it were, I could barely understand what she said in her explanation of the night Andrew found her in a stupor. If the documentary covered the boys' reality, I would think that serious parental issues would be addressed, even marginally, considering the impact parental behaviors have on their offspring.",1426982400,,2450,4.99017199017199
6440464,5,B00KQJRZ8U,"I'm not even sure I can describe why the movie ""Rich Hill"" had such an impact on me. I started watching it today over lunch and dropped everything to finish it. Perhaps asking why I want my teenage daughter to see this film, despite rough language and troubling subject matter, is a good start. I want her to better understand:

- Not everyone grows up with parents encouraging them to go to college, let alone finish high school. In fact, some parents/guardians will buy you cigarettes. Having involved, loving parents is a real advantage in life.

- For many kids, the very idea of a ""vacation"" is absurd.

- There are not many charming small towns. Reality is much different.

- Even if you have nothing, you can be really awesome to your sister.

- Wealth is being able to buy anything you want at Walmart, anytime.

- Her father was not the only boy who spent hours in a knife shop.

- The system can't fix a broken family. Be grateful if you have even a moderately stable home.

- Some kids grow up with no hope. They don't read career books wondering what they will become. The thought of raising above their circumstances doesn't even occur to them.

- Most people, particularly the ones we call ""bad,"" are often a product of their environment. We don't have to excuse their behavior, but we should try to understand where it comes from.

- Many parents, particularly the ones we call ""bad,"" are often a product of their environment. We don't have to excuse their behavior, but we should try to understand where it comes from.

I can't express how emotional I became halfway through the film. I grew up in a small town less than an hour away from Rich Hill. Those boys were my friends and all I wanted to do was help them. They were not bad... they just didn't know what to do and had all the wrong incentives.

I want to express gratitude to the filmmakers. Rich Hill was very, very well done. It told these boy's stories in context, from multiple viewpoints, without judgement. The film didn't have to manipulate the participants--it just listened. What the people said was more revealing than any narration.",1426204800,3,2118,4.544736842105263

6440475,4,B00KQJRZ8U,"Abject poverty, dysfunctional families, and perpetual struggle plague three young men in Rich Hill, MO.  There's Andrew, the insightful and optimistic teenager who has the maturity and strength to rise above his dreary existence, but who ends up being a better parent than his actual parents.  Next up is Appachey, an angry, chain-smoking 13-year old whose home life is summed up by the condition of his house: disorganized and chaotic.  Lastly we have Harley, a socially inept misfit who can't seem to follow the rules and makes them as he goes along.  All three are connected through their shared pain, angst, and uncertain futures.

One doesn't have to look too far to see where things have gone wrong for these guys.  Andrew's mom is a drug addict (who eventually dies from an overdose) who is more doped-up than present.  His dad always has a get-rich-quick scheme but lacks motivation, so they are without basic necessities (i.e., water and lights) or moving dodging rent or moving just because.  Appachey's dad left the family when he was six, and his mother'a job as Pizza Hut  driver  leaves her overworked, temperamental, and struggling to raise her brood of children. Harley's mother attempted to murder his sexually abusive stepfather,  which left Harley to live with his grandmother as his mom serves her sentence.  It is clear throughout the documentary that Harley has severe anger issues, but his real issues are being a lost child trying to find his place in the world.

This isn't a story of how these kids have irresponsible parents who are to blame for their woes (but some are totally to blame).  Rich Hill is a portrait of how these young men are faring under such grime circumstances, and how they must cope in their familial environments and in their communities, one where people view them as nothing more than trash.  It's a hard reality and one that holds little promise that they will ever rise above their own predicaments.

Rich Hill is a documentary any person who is poor or grew up can relate to.",1420329600,5,2029,4.820809248554913

The boys portrayed are truly between a rock and a hard place through poor life choices of the parents.  I  admire Andrew's resiliency and optimism given the situation and the closeness of Andrew's family.  However poor life choices and lack of money management and life skills depicted in the film cannot be overlooked particularly the SMOKING.  Seems practically EVERYONE in the film has a cigarette in their hand.  In addition to cigarettes  they can afford cell phones, junk food and  even  FIREWORKS. Doesn't exactly demonstrate sympathy for their plight.  At least one of the mothers admitted that getting married and having kids at 17 may have not been the best choice.

They come from generations of poverty with a very slim chance that things are going to get better, but yet there is this amazing boy named Andrew in the movie that is so loving and positive that you keep asking yourself how does he do it. Poverty has no race, it can affect anybody. This documentary really depicts what it's like to wake up everyday with not enough money for food, shelter, clothing, and how this effects everything in in a persons life. It's almost impossible for most individuals not to lose direction and hope in life when your born into this kind of poverty.

It's simply about the nuance and hardships of existing in the struggle of day to day life in an income bracket those who have never been privy to likely do not even know a huge and growing percentage actually do exist in.  The team of Andrew Droz Palermo and his cousin Tracy Droz Tragos did a stellar job on this doc and it's won a few awards including The Sundance Grand Jury Prize.  I share the last name Palermo so of course I had to see who these two were and upon finding Andrew's site I must report in my opinion he is extremely talented! Worth searching and seeing for oneself. Have not gotten around to looking further into Tracy's other works however from this doc alone and the fact talent seems genetic in this family I am sure her's is as stellar as I perceive his to be. Unfortunately I don't think there is a genetic link in their branch of the Palermo's to mine and this is likely obvious in the fact I can't even finish a creative thought larger than will I cut my cheeseburger in half today.

6440490,3,B00KQJRZ8U,"Not being a big documentary-watcher, I have to remind myself sometimes that the purpose of the documentary format is different than a feature film. There are little to no boundaries on style, content or approach. And the purpose is normally educational or historical, rather than entertainment. With that said, many elements overlap genres.

One of the most important goals of a feature film is to convince the audience of its reality. The characters must be relatable, and the actors must convince us that they're not acting. That can be easier to achieve in a documentary, and the most powerful thing about Rich Hill is how intensely real the people are. Many moments are captured with such raw honesty that it is painful to watch.

Which isn't wrong, because this is an honest look at three struggling families in an impoverished, rural American town. People make poor choices, things don't always work out and to some extent, we all are the characters in this film. As far as education goes, Rich Hill informs very openly, not only about financial or economic issues, but it allows us to understand the people it highlights.

No, this isn't a fun film to watch, but it accomplishes its mission far better than a lot of documentaries I've watched. And if you're like me, and study the real stories behind everyones lives, Rich Hill is an amazingly honest, painful, and fascinating look into a few of those stories.",1415836800,4,1417,4.847107438016529
6440491,4,B00KQJRZ8U,"What is it to grow up? Some kids have helicopter parents who provide for their children at every turn. And some kids, well, have parents who are just completely lost. There is a level of economic deprivation all over this movie, but some of the houses were fine if they were fixed up. I credit this movie for exploring a dimension beyond poverty.

The movie is really built around a rather charismatic boy, Andrew, whose mother seems to be unable to function. His father can't make money because he can't handle any responsibility, apparently, and they move around just to move around, or because they are broke. Nothing in this movie is really explained, it just a movie about how the kids move along as best they can.

I thought the music was competely overdone. These stories are simple. They are interesting, but not compelling because the movie doesn't offer much hope. The music seemed to be scored to create drama, but this is not a dramatic movie, it is a downbeat one, probably a sad one. I wish the movie was simpler, I guess, just the kids. The movie creates empathy for the kids, so I would say it succeeds.

I thought the ending was outstanding. I was afraid something horrible would happen, but it ended on the note that things would continue down the same morose path, probably forever. I guess no one in this movie has any aspirations, beyond finding a lot of gold somewhere, maybe Alaska. This is not a very efficient society.

6440494,1,B00KQJRZ8U,"This is an email letter that I sent to the director of the documentary, I will paste a copy here, because this is THE TRUTH about the documentary!!

Hello, I will start out by saying that I am not writing this to be hyper critical or to be simply mean, I am writing this because it is the TRUTH. You made this documentary, Rich Hill, and are sending out the message that this is showing ""poverty"" in America, that this is showing the ""poor people"" left behind in America.
This is an ABSOLUTE lie, and you absolutely down deep know it is a lie. This was a documentary on mental illness and the suffering and consequences that occur to the children of parents that are mentally ill. Andrews situation had NOTHING to do with being poor, his Mother was a Junkie pill head and his Father was a lazy, delusional metally ill man. The two parents should NEVER have been allowed to take care of those two children. Harley's Mother was a mess, you try so HARD to make it look like the step father created the whole problem, NONSENSE, to be honest the mother probably told Harley to say those things to help her when she went to trial, you could CLEARLY see that his mother was a methamphetamine junkie that had lost all her teeth. Appachey's Mother was out of her  mind, the house was so disgusting that humans should not have been allowed to live there. She was clearly not capable of parenting or raising a healthy child. You could give ANY of these parents a million dollars in cash and it would NOT help them one bit. This documentary HAD NOTHING to do with poverty in America, AND YOU KNOW IT, if you don't know it then you should not be making documentaries!! There are many poor people that still raise decent kids and can keep their house clean and not move every  two months. EVERY one of those kids problems were directly related to the mental state of the parents. The parents were actually close to being mentally retarded (and I don't say that jokingly), so if you want to live with yourself as a liar, then continue on as your are, if you want to live in honesty, then start telling people your documentary has NOTHING to do with being poor!!!!

6440496,5,B00KQJRZ8U,"This deep look into rural America is well needed. The poverty that these families endure is heartbreaking, and is a story that is not uncommon in small towns across the country. Director Tracy Droz Tragos in an interview for The Daily Show says this about the socioeconomic situation in Rich Hill, MO.

Theres a distinct sting to rural poverty, which is your isolation. Your car breaks down, you don't have enough money for gas, you're really stuck. In Rich Hill, they're just now getting 911.

But where other films have focused on those trying to pay their bills and feed their families, this film focuses on the affected youth. These boys have no control over their situations and, for two of the three boys, have emotional instabilities as well, including bipolar disorder and depression.

There are moments in the film where your heart stops as details of the boys pasts are revealed. There is some especially devastating news just before the credits roll that practically unhinged my jaw as it dropped to the floor. It is a seemingly dismal portrayal of rural life for the young, but at its root is hope. Droz Tragos continued to say this in her interview with Jon Stewart.

Its intense, and its also not without hope. The problem is complex, but there are solutions. There are things that we can do to lift up families who have hit a bump in the road.",1413244800,4,1358,4.669456066945607

Rich Hill is a wonderful endeavor that contains meaningful storytelling, beautiful cinematography, and a lingering discomfort after seeing this level of poverty. Likewise, this documentary stands out because of the access to children. These kids show and tell a heartbreaking lack of financial means. At one point, a young boy says he's learned that he can never predict the future. It's a chilling reminder of the instability in poverty.

I was shocked when I went to write this, and found a review that said, ""...I saw a story about parents who were losers and whose children suffered as a result."" This insensitive and unsympathetic remark is what I fear we think about the impoverished. We assume they're just too dumb to succeed, when in reality they are struggling just to sustain. America makes it difficult to excel, and this movie profiles that.

One star removed because the silent cinematic moments are, at times, a bit lengthy. Would've liked a quicker pace, but otherwise, a great documentary.",1409702400,2,1254,4.850467289719626

While it may be easier for the average middle-class viewer to identify with some of the families over others, the directors present each child equally and without obvious bias.  My one criticism of the film is its running length.  It's just too short!  Maybe this is a result of the film's origins as a Kickstarter project, but I feel like there is so much more that could be said about these kids' lives.  93 minutes only gives us a cursory glance.  In a lot of ways, the film felt very similar to a PBS Frontline documentary called ""Poor Kids"" that came out a few years ago.

I would love to see the directors do a longer sequel that picks up on the subjects four years later, as they enter young adulthood.  It would also be nice to see the directors spend more time with the young girls in the film.  I don't quite understand the reasoning behind the primary focus on the three male subjects.",1409529600,,1044,4.53475935828877

Could it be that their predicament is part of the human condition that allows the freedom for motivated genius on one end and must allow for the abject failure of those on the other end.  Does anyone really think that they can have a significant impact on the children of those who are not capable of raising children?  Orphanages and foster care are not the answer.  Many people have tried to help in situations like these and have cried because they have miserably failed.  If you are writing about how bad you feel, you are only selfishly concerned with the film's impact on your emotions.

There were a lot of amazing on the spot shots that blew my mind. Specifically, the shot where Andrew is slouched back on the bed explaining a situation. That whole frame was perfect for that moment and seemed very lucky to get. I was taken back by it.

This documentary shows the cycle that the ""poor"" in this society are basically stuck there, and really have nowhere to go in many cases.  These children would not have had an audience without the makers of this film, and I hope that it brings enough attention to them that they (and others like them) may receive some sort of help to get out of the conditions that they are in.

I sympathize but I also teach adult learners who are trying to pull themselves out of that hole, and many of them (not all) are succeeding. The poor kid who thought God was in charge of turning his life around and was just waiting and hoping for this to  happen -- this was kind of like his dad.

8660849,5,B00KQJRZ8U,"Three poor teenage boys in a rural Missouri town, each with serious family challenges entangled with issues of poverty and location. One moves every few months since his parents don't hold steady jobs. Another has social and behavioral difficulties staying in school after his mother goes to prison for trying to protect him from her boyfriend. A third is sent to an extended stay in juvenile detention after his overwhelmed single mother can't manage his ""attitude"" or behavior in school. These interwoven stories show how the boys' challenges compound. Each boy brings a remarkably different personality to his situation. In such tough circumstances, I think it was a great idea not to impose any narration, which lets the participants speak for themselves and lets their personalities shine through in what, for them, are normal circumstances. The three story lines keep the film moving and hold viewer interest even as the film focuses on everyday scenes that do a beautiful job of capturing the culture of the place.
