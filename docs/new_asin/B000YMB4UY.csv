8431653,3,B000YMB4UY,"When it says its for begginers, it really means beginners. The first 4 or 5 lessons are all about how to hold the guitar, how to tune it, finger placement and stuff like that. I consider myself a beginner but not to that level. There are about 8 lessons and I only really got information from the last 2 lessons. If you have ever held a guitar and know the basic chords (A-G), you can skip this DVD and go to the 2nd one.",1314230400,3,421,4.023809523809524
