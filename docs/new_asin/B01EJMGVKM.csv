7736342,4,B01EJMGVKM,"Would be 5 stars but season (2) DVD is missing one show No. 25 ""One in a Hundred""from Dec. 23,1953 and they substitute one from season (3) No. 52 ""Death Valley Scotty"" April 29 1955 .It's a real shame that this is missing one show. Hopefully they will include the missing one in Volume (3) . I heard that they donated the complete series to the Library of Congress Archives. Shame it's taken them years to start to put this on DVD. Hopefully they will offer them in a more timely manner than just 2 a year. I would like to see all 18 seasons done before the world ends. This is one of the best western anthology series that was on Tv. I would buy every season of the show. I recommend this even with the missing show!!!",1476489600,27,719,4.179856115107913
7736343,5,B01EJMGVKM,"Death Valley Days season two continues with a great mix of stories that are well written and acted. Remastering on these is good, and the narration accompanying the shows is folksy. Unlike other long running western series that gradually come to DVD as groups of episodes are chronologically remastered, Death Valley Days has already had all 450 episodes restored. Fans like me would like to purchase the complete program now, as we might be quite old by the time the last season is released gradually, akin to the decade(s) it is taking to put out Bonanza and Gunsmoke in entirety.",1476144000,8,582,4.83

7736348,4,B01EJMGVKM,"The episodes are at times entertaining, surprising, heart-warming, amazing or mysterious.  During the introduction to each episode, The Old Ranger declares the story to be ""true,"" yet the internal evidence suggests the episodes are highly fictionalized versions erected upon slim foundations of truth.  It's obvious virtually all the dialogue is made up, for no diary, autobiography, biography, or newspaper article--even if such were extant--would contain such detailed dialogue.  Death Valley Days eschews revealing its documentary sources, if any.  In one ""true"" episode, 4 men lift a box of pennies weighing 3400 pounds, an impossible average of 850 pounds each, and then a lone man counts the 500,000 pennies in one night without losing count!  In another ""true story"" Death Valley Scotty is presented as a nice, friendly, generous, inexplicably rich man who spends up to $10,000 in the blink of any eye, over and over, and concludes that it remains a mystery what was his source of money.  Wikipedia contradicts all this, revealing Death Valley Scotty was a con man, fraudster, swindler, and thief who made at most $5,000 dollars per transaction and spent time in jail.",1517875200,,1175,5.25668449197861
