8092320,4,B000BT9TRK,"Good film with a thorough mix of people, motorcycles, and scenery. Enjoyable recreation viewing. Meaning it almost gives you the feeling of being there.",1348358400,,152,5.375
8092321,5,B000BT9TRK,"interesting view for those interested in Sturgis. This movie has some cool scenery, lots of racing footage and some history of sturgis.",1233705600,3,135,5.181818181818182
8092322,2,B000BT9TRK,"It's OK if it's the only movie you have access to and want to get a glimpse of what Sturgis is all about.

Too little time spent on the bikes and the riding, too much time spent on the racing and night life. I love night life but this was supposed to be a movie about bikes and riding (or so I thought.)

This is a low budget, low quality, and boring movie.",1228262400,5,357,3.8767123287671232
8092323,2,B000BT9TRK,It shows Harley riders as a totaly different breed of motorcyclist. As a keen biker for over 35years i must say that i am slightly embarrased to say that i own a harley as most of the bikers in the dvd are plain show offs. There seems to be a large amount of credit card riders and not true bikers who ride for the shear enjoyment and freedom of the road.,1182816000,9,355,4.014084507042254
8092324,3,B000BT9TRK,"The DVD is pretty low quality and the narrator is boring. Some good shots of the city and what goes on, as well as some good riding shots. They spend a little too much time on the racing (drag/dirt) aspect.  This is an okay movie that gives a pretty good idea of what you'll find at sturgis.",1176336000,6,291,4.105263157894737
