8521151,5,B007R3A2I8,"The Fania All Stars last full tour in '94 made this recording at the Hiram Bithorn stadium in San Juan,Puerto Rico. And what an amazing concert it was. This would be the last time that CeliaCruz Ray Barretto,Juancito Torres and Pupi Legaretta would play with the all stars since they all have since passed away. What a treat to see and hear them doing their thing with the FAS! Check out the unbelievable piano solos from Eddie Palmieri, Papo Luca and Larry Harlow on the one track they all play together. It will knock your socks off! All the singers are outstanding as well. Ismael Miranda,the late great Pete""conde"" Rodriguez. Ismael Quintana, Cheo Feliciano,Adalberto Santiago Celia Cruz all have their spotlight. This concert swings like nobody's business!  Video quality could have been much better but show was well directed. Sound is regular stereo but excellent. Wish they would have put this out in 5.1 multichannel but I digress. At any rate get this unbelievable concert now and enjoy!",1379203200,2,997,4.934523809523809
