5992282,5,B00FGVS06E,"Season 3 is split into two arcs, the first of which takes a breather from battle city due to foes from Kaiba's past wanting revenge with a tournament of their own, aided by someone who wants what Kaiba has and he will do whatever it takes to get it.

Following this, the action in battle city heats back up with the finals, including several high tense action duels including a six part duel between Yugi and Kaiba that can not be missed.

If your a Yugioh fan i'd definitely get this for sure.",1389744000,3,494,4.301075268817204
5992283,4,B00FGVS06E,"Now that the price is right I say go for it. I love the old school Yugioh. I do wish they had multiple languages and a couple features though, only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars.",1383523200,2,190,4.026315789473684
5992284,5,B00FGVS06E,"I can't wait until season 2 & 3 comes out on dvd I already collected season one, just waiting for november 5th for season 2 and than It'll be out. :)
I know season 3 won't be out for months but Im really excited I grew up watching Yugioh and will always be a fan of the original classics. :)",1381795200,3,291,3.8666666666666667
5992285,5,B00FGVS06E,"I imagine this set will be exactly the same as  Season 1 & 2's DVD sets, minus the aesthetics of the box & DVD arts, obviously, but CAN'T WAIT. I think this set will contain the Virtual World filler arc, to the end of the Battle City arc ""Part 2,"" as I'm referring to it as. I honestly can't wait to own this release, as well as the other seasons & series' when Cinedigm releases them. As I've said in my season 2 review, these releases are godsends from Cinedigm & 4K Media & I can't wait to own them all.

This is one of my favorite anime franchises of all time, it's up there with DBZ, Naruto, & the 1st 8 seasons of Pokemon, when 4Kids had the dubbing rights to it. Yes, I'm being as serious about that  statement as I can be. If you want my full thoughts on these products, as I don't think my opinions will change much from season set to season set, as they're basically the same thing, minus aesthetics of the packaging, as I've already stated, go to my review of season one's box set & read my thoughts on that & I'll update this review, when I get the set & have had a chance to look at it thoroughly.",1381363200,12,1110,4.059360730593608
5992306,3,B00FGVS06E,last 2 episodes on the second disc of vol 1 the audio gets choppy and echos and couple of disc look like there's water damage under itself but it works,1451865600,,151,4.066666666666666
5992307,4,B00FGVS06E,good packaging and its a great show and all but i didn't think season 3 was all that. the first 2 seasons are better but its still fun to watch,1449360000,,143,3.8

5992310,5,B00FGVS06E,"*SPOILERS AHEAD*

This is a personal favorite season of mine and includes my favorite story arc in the anime, the Virtual World arc, where Yugi Muto and his friends, even this ones that don't typically duel (i.e. Joey's sister Serenity, Tristan Taylor, ect.) duel against the Big Five, who want to control their bodies in order to escape the Virtual World. One by one the Big Five fail to defeat the gang, with the exception of Nezbitt who defeated Tristan before being defeated by Serenity Wheeler and Duke Devlin. In possibly the most awesome duel of the arc, Yugi and Joey take on the Big 5 in the body of Tristan while risking all their friends bodies to get back Tristan's. I see this arc as being focused heavily on Seto Kaiba, with heavy amounts of his past being revealed and being a complete world-beater in his duel against Noah. The duel between Yugi and Noah is cool too, but I feel Seto's half is better overall in dueling and emotion. Dragon's Rage is still one of my favorite cards to this day and Kaiba almost wins with it. In the end, Noah's father Gozaboru reveals his master plan to use his satellite missile to destroy the Earth, so Seto confronts him and they duel for the freedom of everyone imprisoned there. Gozaboru's Necross-deck is a nice callback to Seto's first duel with Yugi, and Seto narrowly loses, but manages to play his signature Blue Eyes White Dragon in combination with Soul Demolition to destroy Exodia Necross.
The arcs best character was easily Serenity Wheeler in my eyes, as she got to avenge Tristan after he saved her during the duel with Nezbitt.

The rest of the season resets with the Semi-Finals of the Battle City Tournament where after an entertaining 4-Way duel between the remaining finalists, Joey is paired up with Marik in the Semi-Finals, and Seto with Yugi. I was way more excited about Joey Vs. Marik tbh, but Kaiba Vs. Yugi is cool too. Joey spends the majority of the duel losing LP due to Marik's Coffin Seller+Helpoemer combo, which would've gotten even worse if Marik had activated his facedown Malevolent Catastrophe, but thankfully Joey managed to play Jinzo through Question and kill that combo. The final moments of the duel are some of the most powerful ever, and when Marik realizes he was about to lose the duel and Ra, it was just perfect.

Get this set, especially if you love Joey, Serenity, or Kaiba.",1439078400,,2376,4.665871121718377

5992376,3,B00FGVS06E,Now don't get me wrong i really enjoy yugioh and every episode is here in this package. the issue i have with this box set is there is no directory which means you only know what episodes are on which disc by putting it in your player and switching if you wanted to watch a different episode. there are no sub-titles which means no yugioh for the deaf and even hulu has subtitles for the show. all in all im glad i bought the box set but it seemed a little on the cheap side to me but this is the only option for the seris as of now,1395187200,2,532,3.889908256880734

5992384,4,B00FGVS06E,"I love the Battle City arc of Yu-Gi-Oh!. This third volume continues the excellent standard set by the first two seasons in terms of quality, menu, and sound. However, one thing I've noticed: some episodes (Episode 40: Battle For the Bronze Part III) have a very echoey sound, and intermittent beeps, as though the sound is incorrectly transferred or the actors were too far from the microphone. There's just a lot of reverb in the sound on this particular episode.

But on the whole, this is a fantastic collection. Looking forward to the releases of Seasons 4 and 5!",1390435200,2,568,4.737373737373737
