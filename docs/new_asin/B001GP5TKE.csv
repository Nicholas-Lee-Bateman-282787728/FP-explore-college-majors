3616981,4,B001GP5TKE,"I bought this because of the reviews comparing it to Lotte Berk, one of my favorites. This is a workout based on those dance/pilates/yoga moves with some barre work, here done with a chair. The arm section is particularly good. I like this workout, and the variations on standard ballet plies (with a towel between your knees, for instance)are an inovative change,especially if you've been doing ballet barre exercises for awhile, as I have. I didn't give it five stars because I find it a little tedious, but it is definately worth buying.",1232323200,16,540,4.817204301075269

3616987,4,B001GP5TKE,"I am reviewing this workout after doing it one time. I am 55 years old and I am a fairly regular at-home exerciser. I own over 200 exercise DVDs and I am quite familiar with Kathy Smith's offerings. She is an experienced instructor and very comfortable in front of a camera. Her form and form pointers are typically spot on and that is why I keep buying and using Kathy Smith's workouts.

In this workout, Kathy is joined by two excellent background demonstrators. One of them shows more beginner modifications and the other shows advanced modifications. Kathy stayed somewhere in between. Sometimes she would stop doing the workout and just instruct, using the demonstrators as her examples and showing/pointing out form and how-to issues.

The warm-up is five minutes and it gets you moving in all the right places!

The next section is the upper body (13 minutes). I started out with 3 pound dumbbells and ended the workout with 2 pounders. I'm so glad I lowered by weights, because my triceps are still sore three days after the workout! (But sore in a good way. ;)) This is a non-stop workout where you do one exercise and move on to the next without a break. If you are accustomed to doing sets and resting between, you will definitely feel this! The time flew quickly, though, and she ended the section with a nice upper body stretch.

After that we did legs (13.5 minutes). This DVD, I should say, is a barre or ballet-style workout and it's quite obvious in this section. You'll be on your toes for part of the section and will feel it most in your quads and hamstrings.

Next up is butt work (15.5). There are some one-legged squats and then...hmmm....I don't remember! LOL I must have blocked it from my memory!! But, seriously, it was a nice overall butt toner. Some of the exercises reminded me of the lower body workout from her Project:You set, if you are familiar with that.

Core work is the last section (13 minutes). While I previewed the entire section, I confess I didn't actually do most of it, as I have back issues that force me to stick to my at-home prescribed physical therapy exercises. There were a few exercises that were very similar to my p.t., so I only followed along for those. From my preview, most of the exercises were Pilates/barre-style, I'd say.

There is no cool down section. Kathy stretches you out for a couple of minutes after each strength section, which I thought was a nice change of pace from most DVD workouts where you do most of your stretching at the end of the workout. Oh, I should also mention that you can choose which sections you want to do. It is chaptered, so it would be convenient to just do the warmup and core, for example, if that's all you wanted to do.

I'd rate this workout as intermediate. You should preview it first, as there are a few exercises where you can't easily look at the screen and Kathy doesn't always cue the reps all that well. (She is too busy instructing you on your form!)

Overall, this is a good effort by Smith (and her choreographer, Madeleine Lewis!). I have a feeling that I will be using this workout often.",1421280000,6,3104,4.538461538461538

3616998,1,B001GP5TKE,"I purchased this video from the Amazon market place as brand new video,on my vacation in the USA. When I returned home (overseas) to watch and make use of the video, it was faulty and my returning deadline was expired. So it was a waste of money for me and a lack of one exercise video. I purchased  six brand new exercise videos from Amazon marketplace. Two of them was faulty and both was Kathy Smith video. I like her, but  I am afraid to purchase her videos again online. Thankfully I have her other videos at home which I use often.",1379030400,,537,4.254901960784314
3616999,5,B001GP5TKE,"I used to do Kathy Smith's workouts all the time when I was in my 20's and she got me in great shape.  I'm in my 40's now and I am finding that strength work outs are not just a nice to have so I can have a better body. They are a need to have, because as you get older you lose strength, literally.  I noticed it was harder to get up off the floor, and also my posture is starting to suffer.  Also, I am just so out of shape, period.  As I get older, I am only going to lose more strength and suffer from more back and joint issues at this rate.  I wasn't having it.

So I started Kathy's Total Body Lift workout this week and I won't kid you, it's hard, BUT dang, it does work.  I can already see definition starting in my arms and my back is stronger.  I carry myself with much better posture than I did.  I have more energy, too.  This workout really works.

I like that there are four separate workouts, in addition to the warm up.  Arms, legs, butt and abs.  They are each very short and do not involve a lot of moves.  Kathy chooses the exercises that are the most effective and that is what keeps each work out short.  I am pressed for time so I like a short workout.  I was sore as heck the next day after doing these workouts, but not crippled.  I will say that really focusing on keeping your abs tight and when you do the arms, your shoulders dropped, makes all the difference.  Out of all the workouts I found the combination of the legs and butt (I do those two together) the most challenging.  Once I can do that one without my muscles trembling like noodles I will feel like I really accomplished something.

For sure, you can expect overall strength, a stronger core, nice arms and a butt lift from this workout.  Kathy knows what she's doing.

UPDATE FOUR MONTHS LATER:  I've done this workout religiously since May and it has changed my body.  Especially my butt.  I had a typical 40 something behind, hit hard by gravity, having a sit down job, and 2 kids.  I didn't think I'd ever have the round, high bubble butt I had in my 20s doing this video, but I do.  I did not expect that at all.  I am no longer embarrassed wearing a swimsuit and my  jeans look great.  This workout gave me a different body and more confidence.",1368057600,14,2242,4.122685185185185

3617001,5,B001GP5TKE,"I love this one.

It's easy on my body but it really works my muscles and I'm so happy that each routine is brand new! The moves are new and it is great on variety when you mix this video with any of your other video workouts.",1332460800,,226,3.8085106382978724
3617002,5,B001GP5TKE,"This video really kicked my butt, literally!  Each section was perfectly suited to a particular muscle group so you can choose what you want to work on for that day.  This video added a little something different to each routine, that really kicked it up a notch.  I thought this was a really good buy, and all you need are some weights, a chair, and a towel, no fancy equipment.",1310860800,2,379,4.385714285714286
3617010,5,B001GP5TKE,"I have worked out to Kathy Smith videos for years. I believe that this one is the most effective workout that I have ever had. It is VERY challenging. All of the movements target specific areas that I struggle with. It doesn't seem like it should be as hard as it is by how little you actually move but these small movements target these areas very effectively!

I had NO idea that my hips in the spare tire area would hurt so badly after a short 10 minute workout! I actually didn't know I had worked that area during the workout.

As usual, Kathy Smith offers detailed hands on information about how to target the specified area and do the workout with correct form. I never feel like I'm going to injure something while doing her workouts. You can also follow one of the three people for a more basic workout, a medium workout or an advanced workout. I like knowing that I can keep working out with this DVD as I progress in my fitness level.",1303689600,9,945,4.333333333333333
3617011,5,B001GP5TKE,Excellent tape it is segmented into body part sections which mean you can do the whole tape or if you are injured just the sections you want.  I am a regular gym junkie and was surprised at the amount of muscle fatigue and lactic build up I got from doing this tape.  Highly recommend.,1302393600,2,285,4.2592592592592595
3617012,4,B001GP5TKE,"Total Body Lift is a great workout and the only reason I gave it four stars is that it lacks an aerobic section - and I really wish Kathy Smith had included one. The enitre hour is a bit challenging but it has become one of my favorite DVDs - love the upper body segment especially (light, and I mean light, as in 2 lbs., weights needed - and you will feel the burn!!!!) - the lower body segments are effective (yes, take care of your knees and watch your alignment as always) and the abdominal one will make you wonder if you can get through it, but you can and you will really feel a sense of accomplishment. After each ""big burn"" section Kathy stretches you out - instead of waiting for a cool down - there is no designated cool down but there is a warm up. I walk several miles a day and workout 3 times a week with a DVD such as this. I took ballet for 18 years as an adult but find this regime is effective yet less stressful on my body. (I also taught aerobics back in the 80's - fitness has always been a big part of my life - but am no longer into over exercising or punishing my body as with boot camp style workouts.) Does Kathy Smith look a little like Barbie in this? Maybe, but it doesn't interfere, so enjoy an excellent and effective workout in the privacy of your own home. My other favorite DVDs are ""Peel Away the Pounds Pilates"", ""Body Boomers"" (the ""Moving thru Menopause"" aerobics, weight lifting and yoga segments which are nurturing and effective and help you get back on your feet espeically if you're just getting back on track/had an injury/etc)- all from Kathy Smith. Her DVDs are clear, easy to follow and as challenging as you allow. I have tried many others - including Denise Austin, several pilates and ballet inspired workouts but always come back to Kathy Smith.",1294704000,19,1797,4.319526627218935
3617013,5,B001GP5TKE,"Kathy Smith is very professional, gives clear instructions, shows ""how not to"" incl. corrections shown on models. She tells you which muscle groups the movements are for, the ones you should be feeling. Great full body workout!",1273017600,2,227,5.162162162162162
3617014,2,B001GP5TKE,"It's very rare that I finish a new Kathy Smith workout and feel disappointed, but I'm just not a fan of this one. I have very little time to workout each day and after trying this workout yesterday and again today I feel I've wasted two exercise days.

I enjoyed the warm-up to Total Body Lift and wish the rest of the workout could have followed the format of the warm-up (large flowing, stretching, toning moves), but it didn't. The first section (arms) had some great exercises and was the only section where I really felt any benefit, but it's short and there aren't a lot of repetitions. The legs and butt sections seemed like watered down versions of the Lift Weights to Lose Weight workouts (which are much more intense and effective than this one). I turned the abs section off midway through, as I just wasn't enjoying it and felt like I was wasting my time.

I don't know if I was just doing all the moves wrong or what, but my heartrate was never at all elevated, I never felt much isometric resistance, and I didn't feel sore or ""worked-out"" after this DVD, just annoyed. I love Kathy's Matrix method DVD's, but will be returning this one.",1267747200,15,1151,4.476190476190476
3617015,5,B001GP5TKE,This is one of my favorit strength and toning workouts (and I have many)!  I was so surprised that I could get such a challenging workout by using such light weights!  Definitely great for solid toning without bulking up too much!  I also train for/compete in triathlons--this DVD is great for my in-season training when training with heavy weights can really wear me down.,1259280000,6,373,4.796875
3617016,5,B001GP5TKE,I thought this DVD was just what I needed. Some of the repetitions are too fast and some there just aren't enough of them. Good body alignment also needs to be stressed with some of the poses. Otherwise I'm glad to have this DVD in my library....,1256169600,3,246,4.25531914893617
3617017,5,B001GP5TKE,"This is a wonderful departure to the strength DVD's I currently own. I enjoy the isometrics. As always Kathy instructs the proper technique and reminds you to keep good form though out the pose/exercise. The first time I did the DVD I could feel the areas I worked on (good new)!
This is a great addition to an all around workout regimen.",1242345600,13,338,4.467741935483871
3617018,4,B001GP5TKE,"This along with the Maxtrix DVD are my favorite Kathy Smith fitness videos.  The moves are very challening and if you are un-coordinated like me, you may have to view/practice a couple times before you get it down.  I will say that I feel sore right where we worked the muscles.  I do this once a week on my ""toning"" non-cardio days.  A great addition to my fitness library!",1237420800,15,374,4.3768115942028984
3617019,4,B001GP5TKE,"I believe I've done about ninety percent of all of Kathy Smith's videos, and for a good reason. Her workouts are well thought out and well planned, and the most effective.

I believe this video was more challenging than most of her other muscle toning videos because of the intricacy of the movements. The movements are very slight, but they are more intense and the angles are more awkward.

Because the exercises are more unconventional than other videos, it provides a nice change. However, one must be careful about hurting themselves while doing this workout (i.e., knees). The individual workouts themselves are not long, but they are intense. They work your muscles in directions they don't normally go.",1233619200,45,710,5.008474576271187
8306420,4,B001GP5TKE,"I've had some interest in this DVD since it was released several years ago, so I finally borrowed it from my library.  It is a barre-style routine (i.e., lighter weights, higher reps, ballet-type movements) which I tend to like as an occasional alternate to traditional strength routines.  It's led by veteran fitness instructor Kathy Smith.  Smith, who was born in 1951, is in her EARLY 60s at the time she filmed this video--and she looks amazing!  Definitely a testament to regular exercise.

Smith is featured here with two female background exercisers.  She teaches barefoot and live, alternately doing the moves herself and walking around to assist the other two.  The Main Menu of the DVD offers three options, Workouts, Customize, and More from Kathy Smith.  There are five different workout segments listed on that menu, and the ""Customize"" option allows you to play them in any order--an nice feature.  For each segment, there is the option to exercise with Smith's instruction or music only.  I have broken down the workouts in detail below.

WARM-UP (5:11)
This simple flow segment features moves such as feet tapping forward, reach for the knees, knee lift, twists, knee circles, stretch and reach, side lunge with reach, and side bends.  Smith finishes off with a low-back stretch.

UPPER BODY LIFT (12:49)
Smith starts in plank and then proceeds with four sets of push-ups, 10 reps each (not my favorite thing!).  She concludes the floorwork with alternate arm/leg supermans and floor tricep dips.  The standing segment uses light weights and has a strong emphasis on the shoulders.  It includes both front and side delt raises with various tempos/pulses, bicep curls in an extended position, and straight arm triceps work.  Smith uses a towel to assist with stretching at the end.

THIGH LIFT (13:31)
Smith uses both a chair and a towel for this segment.  The towel is placed between the thighs (I used a squishy ball instead) and the chair is used for balance.  The moves are a series of ballet-style exercises, almost all performed on toes and including parallel plies (ending with pulses and ""spring ups""), v-stance plie (with dips and pelvic tilts), and wide plies with pulses and alternating heel lifts.  To focus more on the hamstrings, Smith places the towel behind one knee for one-legged bent knee presses.  The final sequence is a pelvic lift series performed with the heels of the feet on a chair.  Smith again uses the towel for a reclined leg stretch, and she concludes in a seated wide leg stretch.

BUTT LIFT (12:25)
Here Smith again uses a chair, first for balance, then for bent over work.  She begins with a single leg squat, adding a knee lift.  The bent over work includes straight leg rear pulses, both back and out to the side.  The next series includes bent leg rear lifts, finishing with a side push.  Smith then does a short series of stretches from a lunge position (low lunge, twist, runner's stretch).  She finishes lying on the floor for pelvic lifts and then seated for pretzel lifts.

TUMMY LIFT (12:44)
The moves in this section are a cross between barre abdominal work and Pilates.  Smith starts by establishing a c-curve to the back for seated ""scoop"" work; several different sets are performed.  She then moves onto the back with the legs in a tabletop for a move somewhat similar to the Pilates hundred plus taps, toe dips, bicycles, and leg lowers.  She stretches with bridge, cobra, and a cat release, concluding with a side elbow plank with hip dips.  The final stretches are a wide leg seated pose and seated spinal twist.

This is a generally nice DVD with a good variety of options; the segments are sufficiently difficult and can be made even more so by using higher weights.  I would have preferred 10-minute segments (all here are 12-15 minutes) to use these more effectively as add-ons, but that's just me.  Overall, I would recommend this DVD.",1522108800,,3906,4.8459214501510575

8306425,4,B001GP5TKE,"Kathy Smith is cute and funny and has a very encouraging instruction style. She knows how to get you to do those last few reps and helps you overcome workout challenges.

For this workout you will need a towel, mat, chair and 2-3 pound weights. I used three pounds and that seemed fine. This workout works the whole body - arms, legs, butt, abs and core. I would say it is an intermediate workout because the pace is faster in some places. There is no cool down at the end but the exercises are normally followed by some stretching in each section.

Kathy Smith keeps the exercises precise so they work well and tone what needs to be toned. No move is wasted. You might ""mist"" but not really sweat a lot. Still for beginners this will be a challenge. There is positive motivating music the entire time so it keeps you focused.

You can customize your workout too if you don't want to work your whole body. I enjoyed this workout and will do it again as I can really feel this the next day.
