The funny, self-deprecating, expressive Jackie we know appears here as an archeologist, and the actor plays a stern-faced Qin General. The connection between the two characters is the Qin Emperor's tomb. This is thought to be located in a pyramid so enormous that it has, at times, been mistaken for a natural feature. Among the many legends about it is that it contains a three-dimensional map of China, with the mountain ranges, valleys, plains and cities of China laid out as it was then, and even the rivers traced in flowing mercury. According to this story, the Emperor's mausoleum is set in the location of his capital, protected by the usual dire curses and, less usually, his Imperial Army. Of course, in our less credulous age this all seems a bit too fantastic to be taken seriously. At least it did, until we found the army; rank upon rank of terra-cotta soldiers, each one unique, looted of their weapons long, long ago (most likely by the forces of Han, a Qin successor state), now a national treasure with their very own museum. So what's really in the tomb? No one knows for certain, but finally we have an adventure film that speculates.

As suggested above it has two main threads: a Qin-period storyline (in which the movie begins) and a contemporary one. There are breathtaking stunts, dangerous heavies, blurring-fast moves. With her wistful, elfin beauty Kim Hee-Seon plays a Korean princess one might be reasonably expected to die - and return from the dead - for. Andy Leung's character is an ambitious physicist who seeks his archeologist friend's help because he has begin to suspect that there may be an empirical truth behind the old legends - myths - about levitating Indian holy men. Their search takes them to an ancient city in India where they encounter Mallika Sherawat, who is everything an Indian ""princess"" (her status is never made entirely clear in the film) should be, and where they find a startling connection with ancient Qin.

Production values are good, and although the special effects are not always quite A-list (King Kong, Titanic), they generally work well (say, ""Sci-Fi Channel original""). There are times when the dialogue and action are clearly driven by plot rather than by character. The pacing is somewhat uneven, with grim scenes that appear pointlessly long, and tender ones that seem cut off short of fulfillment. Leaving in some of the deleted scenes (included on the Special Features disk that comes with it) wouldn't have lengthened the film by much and would have cleared up several points. At slightly over two hours it's already fairly long and the extra ten to fifteen minutes may have been worth it, especially considering that the viewer can stop the DVD anytime for a quick intermission. Despite these comments, the movie works as a whole; sad, funny, beautiful, bittersweet, entertaining. And the Qin tomb? Maybe it's not quite the way I described it, and maybe you should see for yourself.",1137974400,,3127,4.87593984962406
