8756233,4,B01DKXEWYS,"Just a PSA: you can find this set cheapest at Right Stuf Anime or Saekano.com.

Show review: 4 stars
Without going into any spoilers, this show is a self-aware harem anime about friendship, relationships, and the Gal-ge/Dating sim doujinshi market in Japan. I found that Saekano's appeal relies mostly on its character design and development (namely the girls in the series). The characters are sort of cliche and fall into some typical anime tropes, but in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way. Although this is ""not rated"", I'd say it's a PG-13 rated show. There's a lot of sexually suggestive content in the show but it's not overdone.

Just a heads up, season 2 (Flat) is the conclusion of the show, if you are looking for closure. I could see the show continuing (although at this point, it's not likely) but season 2 is the end of the first arc.

Blu ray features: 2 stars
Very bare bones, as is the Aniplex of America style- sub only (no dub), and practically no extras on the discs. Furthermore Season 1 is split into 2 sets, which is a rip-off if you ask me, but that seems to be the current trend of blu ray anime releases in the West.

Packaging & physical bonuses: 4 stars
The disc ""set"" is really just 1 blu ray in a cardboard slipcase (soft cover). The blu ray I received is clear plastic with crescent shaped disc release buttons, unlike the blue plastic shown in the picture (personally I prefer the clear version for this set).

The box art is fantastic, even though the box construction has a lot to be desired, and features art by Kurehito Misaki- Eriri Spencer Sawamura on one side, and Megumi Kato on the other. The actual art has a gloss finish, with the background being matte, which is a nice distinction. The outer box has an obi which is typically found only on Japanese releases.

The set comes with a postcard set (sealed in plastic). The case outer sleeve art is wonderful and features Eriri Spencer Sawamura, Utaha Kasumigaoka, and Michiru Hyodo on the cover, while Megumi Kato is featured on the back. The design is minimalist but well made, in my opinion. The inner sleeve is designed like a scrapbook with a lot of handwritten text(in Japanese, with English annotations) and some photos. The disc art is designed to be like a release from Blessing Software.

Value: 3 stars
Depending on how much you are paying for this set the value may vary. At $60 I consider it an OK value, although it's bordering on ""rip-off"" (again synonymous with Aniplex of America) with each disc containing only 3 episodes each. This is very common in Japanese releases, but given the amount of information a single disc can hold, it's almost insulting that only 3 episodes are put onto 1 disc.

Overall rating: 4 stars
This isn't a show for everyone. If you don't like the character designs, I'd say you could pass on this one. I really liked the character designs, although our protagonist is somewhat generic. Worth checking out if you are interested in harem anime, the Gal-ge/dating sim market, or you find the characters are interesting and want to see how they develop.",1508025600,,3079,4.636697247706422
