8165768,3,B000M2DMT2,"If you are looking for strictly Tiger material and footage, this video isn't for you.  The DVD covers the popular tank range that the Germans produced in WWII. There is of course footage of Tiger's in action but not as much as I would have expected.  Other tanks are included such as the Panzer I, II, III, IV, Panther, Tiger I, II, and Maus.  The title is after all ""Tiger! German Heavy Tanks"". Perhaps the video should be called ""Panzer! German Tanks in WWII"".  The computer animation is not very good but does help to show tank tactics.  The Bovington Tiger is shown during it's restoration with some really nice interior shots.  A few other tanks at Bovington are also shown.  It would have nice to show some of the other surviving Tigers that are in France and Russia.

The most annoying thing about this video is the commentator.  His voice many times starts at an acceptable sound level and trails off to a whisper.  A number of times I had to back up and turn up the volume.",1230336000,6,982,4.435754189944134
