8015966,1,B0001PCCEG,"Sent back.  Not aware the dvd came in a worn, torn sleeve.  This was meant to be a Christmas present.  Not at all what I expected.",1483660800,,130,3.923076923076923
8015967,3,B0001PCCEG,"Though this is Vol I, the woodworking instructor already knows the basics as he builds simple designs, but before you buy this, you should already know the basics of woodworking; I was therefore disappointed; I want to learn basics like how to use a hand plane, how to use a router, how to use a table saw, what measurement tools are necessary, etc. If you are at the beginning stage like me, this video will probably be beyond your present knowledge. Otherwise, it is excellent instruction for those who have been doing woodworking for a while and have the tools and layout. It's just that this book is not for beginners, as the title 'Vol I' implies.",1358294400,,652,4.581196581196581
8015968,4,B0001PCCEG,"super great book to effectively educate any child about safety and ""stranger danger"", a story told well -we recommend it",1355961600,,120,5.05
8015969,2,B0001PCCEG,"As noted by other reviewers, You should own a shopsmith or equivilent for these videos.  I got them from a reseller and I am glad I did. I have many DVD's and wood working videos. You can see my other reviews. These are commercially made, but slightly deceptive????

Many others to choose from, depends on what type of woodworking you are doing.",1235088000,3,345,4.548387096774194
8015970,5,B0001PCCEG,"The reviewer who slammed this as a Shopsmith commercial sold the DVD in my case. This and volume two are filled with good, simple woodworking techniques, the fact that they are using a Shopsmith doesn't make any of them less useful or unsuited to standalone woodworking equipment. On the flip side, getting to see live woodworking done on a Shopsmith is a boon to me. My recently acquired second hand Shopsmith cost me very little, and while I don't use it for a table saw, all the other functions are saving me a ton of money and shop space!",1206316800,2,542,4.484848484848484
8015971,1,B0001PCCEG,"I bought this and Vol.#2 from Amazon's site but from the cheaper alternative Do It Yourself Videos....man I'm sure glad I did. I can't comment on Vol.#2 as #1 is nothing but a bad sales pitch for the shopsmith,I just turned it off after skimming through the first 5 chapters,still have Vol.#2 in the wrapper. I'm sure glad I only paid about $10.00 to get them as they're not even worth that.",1144454400,29,391,4.444444444444445
