3914065,1,B002DYKPRY,"Meandering, plotless and ugly mess with no redeeming values whatsoever. the picture quality of the DVD was like it was transferred from an old VHS tape filmed without any appropriate lighting. I could not ever understand how this film ever got funding in the first place.",1255305600,2,271,4.913043478260869
8366405,5,B002DYKPRY,I like the film because the actor is very appealing. Although the ending was kind of confusing. Lots of scenes with the actor only in his birthday suit and complements the various scenic spots in Panama.would love to go there with him. Wishful thinking!,1462147200,,253,4.7727272727272725
8366406,5,B002DYKPRY,Matthew Leitch is an amazing actor ! Movie was great,1457136000,2,52,4.3
8366407,4,B002DYKPRY,Didn't know whether I would like this film but it was much better than I thought it would be eventhough the ending is somewhat confusing and upsetting. The masturbation scene is not that erotic but helps the story line. Glad I have added it to my collection of male erotic films.,1360454400,6,279,4.490196078431373
8366408,1,B002DYKPRY,A boring film by a self-indulgent writer/director/producer -- whoever's responsible for this mess.  What a pity we can't rate negative stars.,1322092800,,141,5.714285714285714
8366409,5,B002DYKPRY,"A friend told me about this film. I bought it, and was pleasantly surprised. Well worth the money, and well worth the time involved watching it.",1318291200,,144,4.576923076923077
8366410,1,B002DYKPRY,"This movie wanders and can't decide if it's the story of the principal character, Brian, or a travelogue about Carnival in Panama.  I noted that Matthew Leitch is one of the producers on this film, so he certainly can't say ""I didn't know what I was getting in for.""  Leitch is a fine actor though one wonders if his career is in the toilet which is why he chose to do multiple nude scenes along with the most brazen full-frontal [...] scene even undertaken outside of a porno flick.  His character is obviously a troubled and confused young man, though this film does nothing to resolve his issues, or really tell you what they are.  This is truly a film that leaves the viewer with ""Huh?""",1293667200,,690,4.4523809523809526
8366411,5,B002DYKPRY,"An adventurous travelogue through the eyes of journalist/ tourist Brian.  Highly recommended. This film has many unexpected twist and turns.  At first, it seems like a documentary selling Panama as a tourist destination. but it goes far beyond that as the story evolves.  Don't wanna give too much away because giving too much would spoil it for u.  The message of this docu film should not be taken for granted.  Educate yourself and know the culture you are about to visit.  Matthew Leitch does a fantastic portrayal of the very socially inept Brian while Ameer's direction is fluid and gripping.  This director is definitely evolving and I look forward to seeing many more fresh, original stories coming from him. I noticed on imdb he's working on a new film D'agostino that looks quite disturbing.  Can't wait to see it!.  One of my favorite scenes were of Carnaval Las Tablas.  A well crafted festival of color, culture and tradition.  This film made we want to start making my reservations for next year.  Raw, violent and disturbing it is, but well recommended!.",1280793600,4,1069,4.877777777777778
8366412,5,B002DYKPRY,"This film really drew me in and it is not at all what it first appears to be. I completely believed in the characters, so much so that I actually took it for a travelogue with a few quirks. Matthew Leitch has the most convincing breakdown on screen I think I've ever seen. You'll be horrified by him, but really care about him at the same time. The story is violent, stark, raw, and heart-wrenching, despite being set against such a colorful and celebratory event as Carnival, and it doesn't spoon feed the plot to the viewer. The direction is so subtle that you won't notice the dialog; it feels like these are real people. I liked it even more the second time I watched it. Jose Rosete is also remarkable as a man Leitch's character encounters in Panama.",1275523200,4,756,4.446043165467626
8366413,2,B002DYKPRY,"This is one trashy and raunchy movie, although it does capture the underbelly of Carnaval in Las Tablas Panama.  Plenty of gay/bi-sexual encounters.  I'm sure the Panamanian censors (they do exist) won't (and probably don't) like this less than glamorous portrayal of Carnival but there it is.  In plain sight!",1266105600,,310,5.16
8366414,3,B002DYKPRY,"not sure if this is a documentary or what
quite beautiful as far as the parade footage. nice beaches and hotels.
not bad for this type of film.",1255910400,2,143,4.142857142857143
