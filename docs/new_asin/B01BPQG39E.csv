7665326,5,B01BPQG39E,"Once again I was on my search to find a good horror movie on Amazon Video, when I came across this title. The description sounded interesting and being that it was aired on TV (which we'll get to in a sec) made it even more worth watching.

So I booted up Amazon Video and clicked ""Watch this"" and only to see the classic VHS static screen and footage that was from the 80's. The movie starts off as a news segment  about Halloween and the news casters feed off one another with cheesy jokes (much like the TV anchors today). The anchors advise the viewers of a Halloween Special that comes on after the news and it's about a haunted house where a son has murdered his parents because he was playing with a spirit board and the evil spirits told him to do it. Now a reporter, camera man, 2 paranormal experts (and their cat) and a priest enter the home to hopefully not only catch the paranormal experience on TV but also try to get rid of the evil spirit that haunts the home.

I honestly thought this was an actual TV special until I looked up the TV station WNUF Channel 28 (which there is a station close called WDNU Channel 28). The commercials, the news cast and the halloween special are so well done in the film, you actually start to believe it's real footage. The movie even goes to the length of fast forwarding and the static screen with authentic VHS sounds. The actors in the film deserve an award (he'll, the film does too!) because they play their roles so great, you not only feel apart of the experience but you don't feel like it's forced much like other horror movies today. The ending can be predictable but can also be shocking to some.

Overall, I'm giving this a 5 star rating. I absolutely love this movie! It was such a breathe of fresh ideas and originality. Loved the classic 80's feel, the VHS style footage, the acting and story.

This is definitely a movie to watch for anyone who is looking for something fresh. I could only hope that they consider a part 2 which there are so many ways they can do this.",1470787200,5,2036,4.333333333333333
7665327,5,B01BPQG39E,"This is my all-time favorite found footage horror movie.  In fact, it's my favorite found footage movie of any kind.  Since the first time I watched it three years ago, I've made a point to rewatch it on Halloween night every year since.  It's become a personal tradition.

Now, take that statement with a grain of salt.  Found footage horror is a genre I typically detest.  I love horror movies of all types, but Found Footage will 9 out of 10 times not give me anything I find interesting, just jump scares and/or an evening of boredom.  I have little affection for The Blair Witch Project (sacrilege, I know,) Cloverfield, the V/H/S franchise, or even Trollhunter, and outright hate stuff like The Pyramid and Unfriended.  I didn't even bother to watch any of the Paranormal Activity movies (gasp!)  With all respect to horror fans of every stripe, this really isn't a movie for those types of fans.  Honestly, I'd barely even count it as a horror movie.  I'd say above all it's a very, very high concept horror-comedy, and spends next to none of its runtime attempting to be scary at all, and just barely any more of it attempting to be what could conventionally be considered funny.  Hopefully, my next claim puts fine enough of a point on my meaning:

THIS MOVIE IS NOT SCARY.

If it was attempting to be, it's a complete failure.  But my gut tells me it was trying to accomplish something completely different than that.

This is a meticulous, hand-stitched love letter to Local TV news broadcasts, small-time and small-town advertisements and media, old-fashioned Halloween kitsch, and the very experience of being a horror film fan from childhood in itself.  If you've ever deliberately watched a local public access horror host broadcast a public domain horror film all the way through (Robot Monster, for example,) if you got more excited about Halloween TV specials than you did about getting Christmas presents (that may sound like an exaggeration for you, but I'd say that that's how I felt,) or have ever watched a YouTube compilation of vintage commercials longer than twenty minutes, you're much more likely to be part of this movie's intended demographic than if you're simply a fan of the [REC] franchise.  In fact, I'd say there's a 50/50 shot you'll enjoy the movie based simply on whether you know who Count Gore DeVol is without having to look him up or not (Leanna Chamish is part of WNUF's cast, even.)  If you are part of that more media-fascinated, theoretically-leaning, multiple-DVD-editions-of-the-same-film-owning horror community than someone who cares more about whether or not your horror movies are scary, you might enjoy this one.  Hell, you might even LOVE it, the way I do.  But, caveat emptor.  If you are part of the target demo, you'll understand that the commercials in this movie aren't in the movie's way, they're the reason the movie exists.

TL,DR; This movie is not scary in the least, but it may be one of the most unique movies ever made  for horror fans, and maybe even one of the best.",1467676800,5,3036,4.7942307692307695
7665328,4,B01BPQG39E,"For a lover of Halloween who came of age in the 80s this ""found-footage"" experiment is a treat. I was impressed by the generally flawless interpretation of an 80s local news program (with commercials). I have scads of old VHS tapes I recorded from the television in the early 90s that are a lot like this. They must have pored over old VHS dubs for months to fashion such a faithful reproduction. There are a few disappointments. There are a few bits of dialogue that I feel takes the viewer out of it/exposes the ruse. The ending is not quite what I would have wanted. I think they missed the opportunity to slip a few sight gags and easter eggs in, though I suppose that would have endangered the realism that they worked so hard to capture.

Got to see this little gem the other week.  If you are in a Halloween kind of mood...you will enjoy it.  The special is filled with a fake news cast before the actual ""TV Special"" happens along with fake TV commercials that do look real from back in the 80's.  The special itself is really good also.  The lead reporter that takes you inside of the house reminded me of actor J.K. Simmons.  They have a psychic couple that mimic the Warrens along with their psychic cat...lol.  It's funny.  There is also a reluctant priest who is there if an exorcism is needed however he keeps repeating to the Reporter that he can't do an exorcism without the Church's approval.  Keep watching to you see the end credits.  This special is fun and hilarious.  The actors in it are great!  This is not a film loaded with jump scares or a lot of gore.  It is a dark comedy that lets those of us who grew up back in the 80's re-live those news broadcasts that tried to keep the Halloween spirit alive.

And as others have stated, whether or not they were going for realism, the amount of commercials really padded out what could've worked better as a 20-30 minute short. This didn't need to be 82 minutes long.

7665341,3,B01BPQG39E,"I really do have mixed feelings about this one. I suppose I'll start with a brief synopsis first.

It's Halloween, 1987. WNUF report Frank Stewart is going to lead a team of paranormal investigators into the supposedly haunted Webber house, the site of a double murder decades ago. Live on the air, Frank and his team will attempt to contact the spirits that possess the Webber house. The broadcast starts off just fine, but things quickly go sideways once the team enters.

What I really enjoyed about this movie, was how real it seemed. It does not play out like any other movie you've ever seen before. There are no credits, the picture quality is that of a grainy VHS tape from the 80s, you're treated to numerous commercial breaks, and news stories. It really does feel like you're watching a taping of the news. The first ten or fifteen minutes is the anchors covering news unrelated to the movie. The commercials, unlike the satirical 'Media Break' commercials in Robocop, are serious, and reminiscent of commercials you may have seen on TV when you were a kid. The realism of this movie is what really did it for me. I actually began to feel uncomfortable and anxious once the team enters the Webber home. Everything about the movie's execution leads you to believe that what you're watching is 100% real. This is how a ""found-footage"" film should be done.

As for the downside, there were two things that really hurt this movie for me. As much as the commercials really drove home the realistic feel of the movie, it also bogged down the entire process. You'd get a series of commercials every six-to-ten minutes, depending on what was going on during the broadcast. Some commercials were alright, some commercials were boring, and others drove you nuts because they'd show it a half dozen times. At one point the movie fast forwards through a couple interviews, and a few commercials. I think that feature should have been used a few more times to help speed things along. There were numerous points where Frank and his team start experiencing strange phenomena only for a commercial break to kick in and kill the momentum. I got to the point where I began fast forwarding the commercials myself. As much as I feel they were a great tool to establish realism. Had it not been for the constant commercial breaks, this movie's run time could be cut in half. Instead, it's an hour and twenty-two minutes, and you feel every single second of it.  I really feel that in this case, less is more.

Now, I'm not going to post any spoilers, because that would be terrible. All I will say is I was quite disappointed with the ending. After a strong build up and the creation of actual fear, I felt that the ending was a real let down. That's just me. Maybe you'll watch it and thing the ending was fantastic.

That being said, I'm glad that I watched the WNUF Halloween Special, but I probably won't watch it again. Instead, I'll probably try to find a copy of the BBC1 ""Ghostwatch"" hoax from 1992, which this movie was obviously based on.",1506643200,,3039,4.618518518518519

The WNUF Halloween Special replicates what it was like to tape shows off TV in the 80's. There aren't any beginning or ending credits. The aspect ratio is that of an older TV. Tracking and static are all over the place. The commercials are the high energy, colorful monstrosities. One series of commercials shows a escalating Senate smear campaign between  The news program is full of transitional puns, over the top banter, and cutesy local stories. One of the stories is pretty serious as a soldier with PTSD shot and killed a trick or treater a year ago. All of it was created in 2013. The way the 80's is perfectly captured amazed me. It was like stepping into my childhood.

The special itself involves a reporter from WNUF going to a supposedly haunted house along with his camera crew (actually filming live) and a ""psychic"" couple similar to the Warren's with their helpful kitty Shadow. A crowd surrounds the front of the house in costume, hoping to see something creepy. The house was the place of a gruesome murder by a disturbed boy years ago. Mysterious things happen in the house including unexplained sounds, a smashed EVP recorder, and the poor kitty being killed. The story takes quite a turn from being Halloween fun to an actual threat emerging in the house, revealing the manufactured parts of the broadcast in the process.

I absolutely love the ending. Throughout the movie, signs of the bullshit Satanic panic in calls and protests from Christian extremists called HARVEST, stating that Halloween is evil and people who celebrate it will go to hell. I was afraid that it would end in some sort of Satanic ritual, but the filmmakers turn it around. Those same Christians the ones who brutally murder everyone in the house. It's a way to acknowledge that the Satanic panic was a huge travesty that had no truth to it at all. So many innocent people were blamed for awful things because of the music they listened to or the way they dressed or just because of general hysteria. The ending is perfect and I will watch this movie every Halloween.",1510531200,,2074,4.720994475138122
