8723931,3,B0119T9Y6Q,"A great movie to honor Ramon Navarro as a dashing young actor, but the storyline is rather weak compared to many movies, But we must remember that the ""censors"" interfered with many movie stories and trampled over the original value the movies may have presented. Understandably, many movies did not seem to have a clear storyline as censor interference messed with many a story in the movies Thankfully, as the years have passed so has the influence of a vocal minority lost its potency. Americans should always have had the choice to see the movies as intended Those who do not like, appreciate or condone certain movie content always have the wonderful option of not watching. We will never know how much great movie content was lost to accommodate ""censors."" I believe our movie rating system is finally in a reasonable and realistic condition with actual explanations for the rating in the boxes which used to remain empty and always made me wonder why they did not put the values there in the first place.
Clearly, this movie conveyed in ambitious young man who made his way up only to end up the only way criminals of his stature could end up according to movie values The bad guy always loses. Not always realistic, but a good moral message Engaging in dangerous behavior can endanger those dear to you. Beware!",1459468800,,1319,4.739130434782608
