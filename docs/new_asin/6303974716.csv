747439,4,6303974716,"VCI Entertainment and The Rank Collection presents ""DOCTOR AT LARGE"" (1957) (98 min/Color) -- Starring: Dirk Bogarde, Donald Sinden, Muriel Pavlow, James Robertson Justice, Shirley Eaton, Derek Farr, Michael Medwin, George Coulouris, Anne Heywood, Lionel Jeffries, Mervyn Johns, Ernest Thesiger

Directed by: Ralph Thomas

VCI has restored and brought from their vaults another great film from the British Invasion.

James Robertson Justice is at his acerbic best in this installment, and it's great to see Joy (Muriel Pavlow) make a welcome return.
and the predicaments Dirk Bogarde gets himself into in the rural practitioners are hilarious.

'Doctor At Large' sees the series go back to their basics, with a return to St Swithin's and a reunion with all the main cast of 'Doctor In The House' (with the single exception of Kenneth More).

Without much plot, this is a light film, except that Simon comes up against Benskin (Donald Sinden), his rival at St. Swithins, who gets the position that Sparrow wanted. It's humorous without being riotous.

Check out the scene where Simon and Nan McPherson (Shirley Eaton) stay overnight at an inn. The proprietress puts them on different floors, and when Simon attempts to sneak downstairs into Nan's room, the woman comes out into the hall. ""I was looking for the bathroom,"" he says. ""It's on your floor,"" she says. ""The door is marked 'Bathroom.'"" Then she sits in the hall, thus thwarting further attempts.

Though not as good as the first (Doctor In The House), but much better than the second,

Doctor In The House was so successful that it spawned not only six sequels, but also a television spin-off.

Richard Gordon: The author of the original books (and of the screenplay here) is on screen hidden behind the anesthetist's mask in the ""patient wakes up"" scene. Gordon did the job in real life before turning to writing.

Karlovy Vary International Film Festival 1957 Nominated Crystal Globe (Ralph Thomas)

747441,3,6303974716,"Doctor at Large represents a typical light-hearted British comedy of the 1950s: Plenty of banter, lots of tomfoolery between the sexes, and a slew of comical episodes connected only by the barest of plots. It is all quite delightful and amusing, if not particularly sophisticated. This particular genre of films continued with a number of additions to the Doctor series, and is kind of a precursor to the Carry On films, which managed to take the level of humour down a couple of notches further.
Afficianados will take great pleasure in the supporting cast, which is positively overflowing with familiar names and faces from British films.",1040256000,2,640,5.047169811320755

The whole series is funny, big fan of Bogarde & James Robertson Justice, but hope I never get sick... LOL A must for anglophiles.",1424390400,,358,4.609375
7857713,4,6303974716,Humor was accomplished when artistic creation was restricted by public morality of the time.  Few if any movies could attain this in the 1950's.  Beauty being present for both males and females contribute to the enjoyment of the movie.  It's worth a look.  Dirk Bogarde and Muriel Pavlov excel in their roles.,1424390400,,309,4.884615384615385
