8416663,1,B0045FXD32,"This is a wonderful series of baseball vignettes, mostly in color, and I was enjoying it immensely -- until I came to disc 3. The first episode of this disc (#10 in the series) was fine, but beginning with episode 11, the material became increasingly unplayable -- pixilation, audio drop-out, freezing. The ensuing episodes were not even accessible. In despair, I ordered a second set, trusting that the first one was just a fluke. No such luck. The second set was faulty at the very same spot. Beware of this shoddy product. Such a shame -- because the documentary itself is brilliant.",1350345600,4,586,4.754901960784314

8416665,5,B0045FXD32,"This is a wonderful compilation of life and the influence baseball had in the 30's through the 60's.

Each episode makes me well up with pride of the character that once was America, and I wonder where that courageous country went.

The soundtrack of the music that is used and the narration of Alec Baldwin are worth the price of this DVD series alone.",1280620800,15,353,4.5
