1744834,1,B00006FD94,"This movie is all too typical of the slasher film, and evidence that film makers in Germany/Czechoslovakia have no more creativity than our own American ilk. With copious accents, Heineken advertisements and the typical ""coming of age meets coming of death"" plot, plodding through THE POOL is an exercise in pleading.
The movie starts with your typical SCREAM beginning: girl chats on phone whilst making dinner, gets a spooky call, runs outside, finds her boyfriend dead, and then dies herself. To make matters worse, the killer looks like a reject from Saturday Night Live's ""Sprockets"" (""now is the time on Sprockets WHERE WE KILL!""). Cue the Dawson's Creek / Felicity soft rock, and we're going down hill within the first five minutes. From there, we follow our cast as they stage an illegal party at the local pool resort.
There are some relatively decent aspects as the movie is expertly filmed with good scenery (it is Europe after all) and some slight twists on expectations: instead of the opening fodder grabbing a knife, she attempts a shotgun, instead of one car playing [bad] music, an envoy of student vehicles engage in synchronizing [awfulness], and instead of using CDs, these supposed ""rich kids"" use cassettes.
Deaths are nothing too inventive, but two in particular ""succeed"" visually: the death of the poor girl, Kim (Isla Fisher), is held a bit longer than you'd expect, and the vent killing of Martin (Jason Liggett) is decently conveyed by blood running down his hands as its clenched by a helpful Sarah. The most inventive scene is spoiled before the movie even starts - ""knife to water sliding female crotch"" is the DVD's flipping menu intro, for God's sake.
With no nudity besides a quick flashing, the standard ""heroine overcomes her fear"" sub-plot resolves, and the remaining survivors create a love triangle of ""you cheated on my boyfriend, but it's ok because WE'RE ALIVE!"". The most telling aspect of THE POOL is a line at the end of the movie, ""I know what you did last summer..."", whose only decent viewer response is ""yer goddamn right!"".
The 16:9 widescreen DVD includes ""Behind the Scenes"" (10:37, consisting of clips from the movie, mini-interviews, shots of the water slide kill, etc.), a photo gallery (30 images), filmographies of the directory and cast, Spanish subtitles, and the expected trailer (1:17, Voice over: ""It was their last day of term. When you've been there, done that, you need somewhere special to go... but it's about to become a night they'll never forget... because someone is watching, waiting, and ready... to KILL! Now, the only way to stay alive, is to follow the rules."" On screen: ""Now Running. No Diving. No Splashing. Welcome to the Deep End."").",1050278400,11,2714,4.953947368421052
1744835,2,B00006FD94,"I bought this one because my cousin is in it, top-billed and the only American, no less.  It was shot on location in Czechoslovakia and has a lot of Germans on both sides of the camera.  There are a few nice shots of beautiful downtown Prague; but otherwise it is indistinguishable from a hundred other ""mad-slasher"" (or, in Roger Ebert's terminology, ""dead-teenager"") movies.
A bunch of students at the so-called ""International High School of Prague"" decide to spend the night after final exams at a huge swimming pool-spa complex (Aquapark Babylon Centrum in Liberec, CZ, according to the credits: looks like a fun place), where they are picked off one-by-one by the inevitable bad guy, this time in skin-tight black and a white skull mask, wielding a machete.
You haven't seen so many ""wandering-down-endless-corridor"" tracking shots since ""The Terror"" with Boris Karloff and Jack Nicholson (1963).  Other theme ripoffs include crawling through ventilation ducts (""Aliens""), and stabbing through the walls of enclosed spaces (""Terminator II"").  I'm not an expert on this genre, but I'm pretty sure all the traditional mad-slasher-movie cliches are repeated here as well.  Even the obligatory bumbling police inspector makes his appearance.
Heineken's beer is apparently very popular in Prague (they get a promo credit at the end), and everybody except my cousin smokes like crazy.
The bad guy is ultimately revealed to be--surprise!--one of their own group, and naturally he turns out to be very hard to get rid of.  My cousin kicks him in the privates, throws liquor bottles at him, sets him on fire, and cuts his throat with a broken Smirnoff bottle; and after all that, he still has to be shot.  Eat your heart out, Sigourney Weaver....
The DVD case promises ""brief sexuality/nudity,"" but it turns out to be very brief.  One of the minor female characters flashes, ""Girls Gone Wild"" style, for about 1.5 seconds.  (I was hoping for at least some good steam-bath scenes.)  Don't get it for the nudity.
""The Pool"" is not a serious contender for any major awards.  On the other hand, as I told my cousin, this is where Jamie Lee Curtis got her start.
Gets two stars only because my cousin is the star.",1050192000,2,2204,4.94579945799458
1744836,4,B00006FD94,"I was actually suprised by this film.  Many people hated it because they felt that it was just a carbon copy of Scream.  Well, it is, and not a really good on at that, but, it is still fun to watch.  While the plot isn't all that great (well this is a slasher film after all), it still was enjoyable enough, and set up everything for the kills.
And lets talk about the kills.  They are VERY extreme.  Limbs are chopped off, and people are cut in half.  If this movie succeded in anything, it was in being gooey.  That is whats needed for a slasher film, buckets of blood.  Many of the new ones forget that important ingrediant, but this one has it in gallons.
Also of note is the cast.  Most of which have THICK European accents.  Someone mentioned them being dubbed over, but I only noticed one moment were the dialogue seemed dubbed, otherwise everyone was speaking on their own.  This is good and bad.  It is good because it saves the dialogue from seeming kind of seperate from the film, or to clean.  It is bad because some cast members (namely one girl) are near impossible to understand at times.  Eh, who is listening to the dialogue any way.
For a good slasher film that really pays off in the slash department, grab this movie.  If you want some deep film that delves into the human psychie, well what the hell are you looking at a slasher film for.  Go rent Session 9 or something.  I totatally recomend this one.  Oh, and look for Mary Jane from Scooby Doe as the red head who bombs her exams.  Her accent may through you off though.",1042502400,,1545,4.302083333333333
1744837,4,B00006FD94,"THIS MOVIE DESERVES SOME RESPECT. IT FEATURES SOME OF THE MOST UNIQUE MURDER SEQUENCES EVER SEEN IN HORROR SLASHER MOVIES. I REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE AND I THOUGHT THE STORY WAS VERY GOOD.

1744838,1,B00006FD94,"One of the most boring horrorflicks ever. All the actors are much too old and much too untalented. The plot is just a joke, the entire film is completely redundant.",1034553600,3,164,4.5
1744839,4,B00006FD94,"I reanted this movie on a Friday night. I always rent good horror movies, especially slasher ones. Since i have aleady seen all there is to see (and the world is running out of slasher movies) i rented this.
The movie began with a good murder with a great mask and a very cool weapon (the mashetty (don't know if spelled right)). Also, there are plenty of teens that could be the killer, so it keeps you guessing till the very end.
This movie also has some pretty good on-the-edge-of-your-seat killer scenes, and they're all different. For example, one is in the woods, then one is in the air-conditioning ducts.
This movie was awsome, until you find that the killer's motive was kind of dull and not worthy of a mass serial killing.",1034467200,,733,4.518796992481203
1744840,2,B00006FD94,"I love slasher films and will forever love slasher  films, but there are some that you want to remember a little more than others. My case in point ""sleepaway camp "" classic and gets better more times you watch it but ""the pool"" on the other hand of which this is true not the worst of the slasher genre but far from the best in the crop of so many horror titles having a mask wearing pyscho. The acting not all that bad but the plot drags so much you find yourself wanting to fast forward to when the good stuff starts. This feels like any movie you have seen a 100 times before it's way to predictable and the character development is terrible even for a slasher film .It does have one memorable killing on the covered water slide but other then that not much going on here that has not been done to death and fails miserably! If this would have taken place at a public pool not even the lifeguard would have wanted to save this dud of a slasher!",1034121600,2,948,4.180327868852459
1744841,5,B00006FD94,"This movie was great. I bought the region 2 (UK) Version and I was really surprised. To me a movie can have the worst plot and as long as the killings are plentiful then Im happy, but this was an exception to that rule. The Pool had a cool plot about some graduating seniors who break into a new swimming facility to party on graduation night. Of course there is a mystery killer lying in wait to ensure that none of the students live to tell about the wild party that they threw. The setting is very unique and is not wasted with the same old murder scenes. This movie has some of the coolest death scenes I have ever seen. All I have to say is imagine sliding down a tube slide, legs spread apart, and seeing a knife come through the floor of the slide right in front of you....OUCH cant even begin to describe it. All things aside this was a surprisingly unique horror film that shows that maybe we haven't seen all that slasher films have to offer and it reaffirms that its possible to create an original and thrilling movie. Brilliant",1033344000,3,1039,4.3061224489795915
1744872,4,B00006FD94,it lacks  originality and has  a weak plot but its still good. tones of blood and gore. and a cool ass pool. better than other cheap slasher movies. worth watching.,1089244800,,164,4.433333333333334
1744873,3,B00006FD94,"Perhaps no better way exists to compare the gradual dominance of Hollywood over all foreign film markets than to look at the horror genre. Once upon a time, European horror films developed their own intriguing mix of gory scares, with directors like Dario Argento and Mario Bava leading the pack into a brave new world of shriek cinema. Argento started out with the Hitchcock themed ""The Bird With the Crystal Plumage"" but managed to invent the giallo film in the process, that unnerving cinematic style involving stalk and slash carnage committed by a black-gloved madman. Bava's ""The Twitch of the Death Nerve,"" arguably the first modern slasher film, inspired countless imitators in the form of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" and Sean Cunningham's ""Friday the 13th."" Those halcyon days are now over; replaced with films like ""The Pool,"" a German slasher piece that sets no new precedents and covers no new ground. In fact, this movie by director Boris von Sychowski is an extremely derivative horror picture whose antecedents are ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" more than Argento's or Bava's masterpieces. Obviously, film buffs could advance compelling exceptions to this thesis, but the central premise holds solid. Tinseltown now dominates the world horror market.
If you must think of ""The Pool,"" think of a Eurotrash cast with a sprinkling of Americans and South Americans thrown in for good measure. Set in Prague, the movie follows a group of students graduating from the International High School. Since all these kids will soon go their separate ways, the official leader of the group, Greg (Thorsten Grasshoff), decides to throw one last alcohol fueled bash. Rather than do something boring like party at someone's house or apartment, Greg approaches a friend about getting the gang into an aquatic park in town. Doing so requires breaking into the place, a risky proposition that could involve jail time if the police catch the kids. But how much fun it could be! Romping around the water slides and the pools while drinking the night away sure sounds like fun. Besides, the setting gives the director the chance to put his young cast into skimpy swimsuits. You can guess what happens next: the kids turn up at the pool, start having fun, and then begin expiring in hideous ways. It's stalk and slash time at the water park, and only a few might make it out alive.
The chap hunting down the gang wears a black outfit while wearing a skull mask. He's got his work cut out for him; I think at least a dozen cast members are hanging around the water park when the party begins. The most important characters include Sarah (Kristen Miller), an American worried about her future; Carmen (Elena Uhlig), a German snob harboring a few secrets from her other friends; and the aforementioned Greg. You've also got Kim (Isla Fisher), Svenja (Linda Rybova), Diego (Maximilian Grill), Mike (James McAvoy), and Mel (Cordelia Bugeja) waiting in the wings. A few more characters are present as well. At least you know the body count will be high. A bunch of subplots pop up from time to time, such as hidden relationships, one of the students languishing because she failed her finals, and a cop on the outside methodically tracking the killer to the swimming pool park. Two scenes of carnage take place outside the aquatic environs, one at a house of a mutual friend that recalls the opening scenes of the first ""Scream"" and another one in the forest. The conclusion, following one extended chase scene after another, made me wonder if the killer was somebody these people knew or Superman. Only the man of steel could take such a pounding and pop back up for more.
The single biggest problem I have with ""The Pool,"" the one thing that really had me grumbling under my breath, is the huge number of cast members. Director Sychowski simply does not possess the skills to juggle this many major and minor characters in a film of this length. It's not a poor reflection on him; many directors could not achieve such a balancing act either. Too, once the bodies start falling it gets even harder to remember who is who. A scorecard with names matched to pictures of the actors might have helped. At first, I thought the various accents of the characters would act as label for figuring out who was who. I was wrong. With the exceptions of the Americans and the Aussie, the voices of the other nationalities began to blend into an unidentifiable Eastern European patois. I halfway expected the murderer to pull off his mask and identify himself as Gavrilo Princip. If you think the murders will save the movie, think again. Sure, a few imaginative incidents take place. The waterslide disaster looks like it draws the most attention from viewers. You know what I thought when I saw it? Dario Argento would have done it better, and done it in a way that would have truly made us cringe. Instead, the scene ends up being a pale imitation of what it could have been.
The DVD from Artisan Entertainment contains a few extras. Trailers, a photo gallery, and a few interviews with cast members all appear on the disc. The picture quality is good, too. It's tough to recommend ""The Pool"" to horror fans. Slasher film fans will probably like it to some extent, as much as they like any of the other hundreds of similar films out on the market, but viewers seeking a unique experience should probably look elsewhere. ""The Pool"" deserves three stars for a few good scenes and an occasionally effective stab at atmosphere. Just don't expect to be wowed.",1086652800,2,5548,4.798328108672936

1) Obtain sponsorship and money to produce it;

3) Persuade actors to accept such stupid roles;
4) Manage to be released in DVD, instead of being sheleterd forever;",1082332800,,478,4.569767441860465

The teenagers are like usual, idiots listening typical Punk Rock music. The plot ... Is there one in it ?

1744877,3,B00006FD94,"This movie has the most clichs of any horror film I have seen, but here are some thoughts to consider:
1.  The pool setting, Prague, and cinematography are all great!  Even the acting is good.  You can sit there and play identify the accent since it is difficult enough to tell the actors apart having no variety in outfits, hair color, or race to help us out.
2.  They don't get killed unaware of what is going on, there is a struggle for survival that makes it all fun and exciting to watch.
3.  You can spot the incongrueties with reality and ponder such questions as ""Are there no umrella in the Czech Republic?"", ""How can he not climb into a vent 6 feet of the ground?"", and so many more.
4.  Some great death scenes worth seeing involving air vents, water slides, and bathroom stalls.  Many tributes to classics such as Scream, Aliens, the Poseidon Adventure, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and so on.  And it is not predictable, I challenge anyone to identify who will die in the movie before hand (and not 2 minutes before they bite it).
If they had someone rework the script for the clichs and incongrueties, this could have been a classic.  Knowing what you are getting into before hand, this is still worth watching as an exciting slasher (they know they are trapped and in danger, unlike many slashers where only the lead ever figures it out and the rest get killed walking aimlessly around the house) or a game with friends in the evening as you explain why each scene makes no sense (it is not always blatant or easily spotted).",1059350400,,1544,4.446808510638298
1744878,1,B00006FD94,The Pool is actually pretty decent considering the loads of bad movies these days. I guess this German made film learned from some other films mistakes. The movie is about a group of kids partying after High School Graduation and deicide on an upscale indoor pool which unknowingly lurks a killer.

The film had a Scream-esque opening and two well known stars with early roles in this film. The death of Isla Fisher's character in the film got me interested getting it on dvd. The most interesting thing about it is that it's from Germany even though it was dubbed in the United States. The Pool is a pretty good slasher film with perfect wit, interest and most importantly, a fun-to-watch vibe.

7967463,2,B00006FD94,"This is the typical B grade slasher pic that rips off Friday The 13th. It's basicly putting Jason Voorhees (A guy in a mask with a machette knife) into a situation where he can slaughter a bunch of college grads who have broken into a rec centre for the graduation party.

The acting is mostly terrible, the scares are stupid, the horror is not there, and the chill factor is in the minus 10 area. About the only kill in the movie that was any good was one of the kids coming down a water slide...but it didn't show anything memorable for the effect to work to its maximum potentiol.

7967464,3,B00006FD94,"A not particularly original but still solid entry in the 'lurk, chase, and kill' section of horror, ""The Pool"" covers familiar territory but does it well.  A group of students from an international private school creep their way into a private building with an Olympic-size swimming pool for an end-of-the-year bash, only to find themselves preyed upon by a black-clad assasin.  What the basic premise lacks in originality is made up for somewhat in the details; there are some innovative and jolting moments and pursuits, and it attains an unnervingly real feel in places.  Not a classic of the field but good, and it came along at a time (2001) when it was desperately needed - ""Friday The 13th"", ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"", et al. were temporarily in limbo, replaced, mostly, by parodies.  2001 was the year, internationally, when movies like ""Dagon"", ""Jeepers Creepers"", ""Valentine"", ""The Devil's Backbone"" and ""Bruiser"" were starting to kick the door back in for horror movies to become hugely successful again, beyond the loyal following that stayed with them all through the latter half of the 90s, and ""The Pool"" was a solid little part of that long-awaited rennaissance.

  It did well enough theatrically in Europe that a sequel is apparantly coming out soon.  I liked the first chapter, and I think the potential exists to get significantly better in any future installments.  As it is, ""The Pool"" is a fine movie, recommended to fellow fans of F13, ""Halloween"", NOES and similar greats.",1136419200,,1499,4.9879518072289155
