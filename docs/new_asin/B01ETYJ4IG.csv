7739928,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"There is something compelling about the movie version To Hell And Back which I first viewed as a boy in the 1950s.  Perhaps it was the fact that the star was the hero himself ""replaying"" some of his own wartime  experiences.  Over the years, the movie has appeared repeatedly on  television, and almost routinely on the History Channel.  I've watched it  many times.  The movie, however, pales by comparison to Murphy's actual  Medal of Honor citation.  Now that I finally have read his book, the  citation itself seems to offer only a fraction of the story behind his  guts,determination, and eventually the horrible memories he endured until  his untimely death in a plane crash. It makes me shutter to think of myself  as a combat veteran from Vietnam compared to what men like Audie Murphy had  to endure for the duration of their tours in World War II. But, it also  makes me realize that war for frontline troops has changed little from one  generation to the next.  This ought to be REQUIRED READING for everyone who  send others to war!",928195200,16,1044,4.6740331491712706
7739929,5,B01ETYJ4IG,I just loved this tale of one man's account of America in Europe during WWII.  Maybe I'm just an old softy for Audie Murphy but I'd call it a must read for anyone.,924220800,3,163,3.9393939393939394
7739930,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"I first read this book as a young man before entering high school.  The book and Audie Murphy became a symbol of not only what one man can do, but what one man can stir in the friends and comrades around him.
Murphy's  acts, thoughts, and efforts described in this book make him an absolute  hero not only during the war, but should be displayed for generations to  come as a man that believed in our country and the American Cause.  It is  the ideals that he fought for, and the American people that he believed in  that make this book a must read for all types of people that would want to  feel good about the United States of America and to be personaly uplifted  and moved by the challenges that this soldier endured and overcame.",919987200,7,735,4.306569343065694
7739931,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"A fantastic war movie, especially for 1955; I expected something more easy on the emotions, something more careful in its war scenes, but there was none of that.  The film rivals Saving Private Ryan in its tense, confusing,  violent battle sequences, although the gore is not there.  The humanness of  the soldiers is a nice touch to the movie as well; getting to know the  characters and understanding the big heart of Audie Murphy forced me to  stand up and cheer when the troops, or should I say friends, accomplished a  difficult task. One of the most tense scenes in the movie occured when the  3rd division soldiers attempted to take a farmhouse in Anzio, a scene  nothing short of nail-biting.  The direction of Jesse Hibbs is tight and  keeps you on the ground with the soldiers, and Audie Murphy, having been a  great soldier to say the least, is actually rather good as himself, playing  well off the other actors and showing feelings through subtle facial  expressions.  He commands the power of nuance in his performance.  A  good, patriotic film.  Short, tense, impressive. For anyone interested in  WWII.  One of the best in its genre.",912384000,9,1149,4.76530612244898
7739932,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"I read this book not too long ago and while I was reading it, I wanted to  tell everyone everything that Audie Murphy did. It was especially good  because I am a scholar in World War Two history, and I have been an Audie  Murphy fan for quite a while.  Some of the great things about this book is  how many think of war as being an honorable thing to do, but this book  opposes that thought.  This book is about his experience in the Second  World War and explains how hellish it was for himself. I suggest anyone who  gets a chance, should read this fine book.",909360000,4,561,4.12037037037037
7739933,1,B01ETYJ4IG,"Read the book, which is excellent. This movie is poor quality and has little to do with the book. Although this was the highest grossing movie for Paramount until Jaws, it has little to do with the man who deserved better. I would love to see a remake of this movie with the real story as written by Mr. Murphy. I would not recommend this movie. Read the book for the true account of America's Greatest Hero. This movie was little more than very fake battle scenes with fake explosives and no blood. As a Vietnam veteran, I can tell you this is as far from reality as one can get. Also, things happen in the movie that never happened in the book. Because of his stature, would love to have seen a young Tom Cruise portray the leading character with adherence to the book. Need a young, short, relatively small actor to star in a remake to understand the true heroism of this man that the Marines and paratroopers turned down. Don't waste your time watching this movie. He has so little to do with the book you will wonder why it was made. Could have been so much better. And it's not the actor in the lead role, it is the way he is portrayed. They tried to make it seem as if war was just a fun game, not the ""Hell"" it really is.",1532736000,,1229,4.189873417721519

These stories should never be forgotten and I highly, highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading about the Greatest Generation and the terrible price they paid to guarantee the world that we inherited from them.

7739988,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"To Hell And Back

This 1949 book was a top best-seller for many months. It is dedicated to his two friends who were killed in action at Anzio and near Ramatuelle France. Chapter 1 starts at the invasion beaches of Sicily. A shell explodes, another soldier picks up a mans ammo. He won't be needing it. The Murphy family were very poor share-cropper farmers in Texas. Our situation is not to be blamed on the social structure he wrote. [But there were no Homestead Laws then.] His father deserted the family, then his mother died. The three youngest children were put into an orphanage. Audie worked at a filling station and a radio repair shop. [Training or education for his future?] He often got into fights at school. Being undersized, he was rejected by the Marines and the Army paratroops before joining the infantry. [Did combat classification mean higher pay?]

On a scouting patrol he shot two retreating army officers. Next he was promoted to corporal. The actions in battle are recorded. They advance and take casualties. Some descriptions are sanitized for the general public, but you can read between the lines. The soldiers comment on others and tell about their own lives. They advance and take casualties. Life in combat is no picnic, they are often short of food and sleep. But they push on, day after day. Chapter 4 finds them in southern Italy near Mignano. Wounded enemy soldiers are carried to relative safety, little help is possible for them. The enemy retreats, they advance to Cassino. Then they are sent to the rear for a short vacation. They spend time in Naples (Chapter 6). Audie suffers from malaria (Chapter 7). One soldier is shot in the night because he didn't identify himself (Chapter 9). One man is a deserter (Chapter 10). Another of his friends is killed (Chapter 12).

His best friend Brandon is killed (Chapter 14). German resistance grows stronger near the Vosges mountains (Chapter 16). Audie gets a sniper (Chapter 17). Audie is promoted to lieutenant (Chapter 18). A bullet hits his hip. Delayed treatment resulted in gangrene. The Army is now in Germany (Chapter 19). Audie directs artillery fire against the enemy troops and tanks. Then uses the machine gun on the burning tank destroyer against the enemy. [Medal of Honor.] They continue to advance (Chapter 20). They cross the Colmar canal (Chapter 21). There is a close call when three German tanks pass by. The troops are sent to a rest camp. Audie is transferred to liaison duty (Chapter 22). The men march through the Siegfried Line unopposed. They cross the Rhine. Audie is on a rest leave when they hear about VE day. Images of the past play in his mind.

There are 22 chapters in this 274 page book (which has no Index); it is a personal memoir. The last sentence in the book says I will learn to live again. This book does not mention that he was the most decorated soldier in the Army. Or any of his post-war traumatic stress disorders. Audie Murphy, like some others, was cast in Hollywood movie in the late 1940s and 1950s, mostly westerns. The 1955 movie To Hell And Back was the top money-making film until Jaws in 1975. Given the lowered value of the dollar and the higher admission price, THAB is probably still first by paid admissions. This movie seems to have been banned from TV after Audie Murphy died in 1971 at age 46.",1519776000,,3337,4.699145299145299

7740000,4,B01ETYJ4IG,"To Hell and Back, was with and about Audie Murphy.  It was worthwhile for historical reasons, but it turned out surprisingly good.  Murphy died in a plane crash flying with a private pilot. This was unfortunate, and probably unnecessary.  My first experience with these types of accidents was in the late 1950s, when another airmen of my acquaintance died flying with a buddy, who just obtained his license.  Since then, I have seen many friends and associates experience the same fate, flying with some fly by night pilot who thought he was much better than he actually was.  I had a boss in the 1970s who asked me again and again to fly with him, because he knew I flew in the Air Force.  But thats precisely why I consistently refused to do so. One day, he caught me with my horns crossed, and I flat out told him. Im a professional.  I am not about to get into an aircraft with an amateur.  And that was the end of that friendship?",1515974400,,935,4.395348837209302

7740002,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"Yes ""To Hell and Back"" is one of the best most honest account of what WAR was really like by a man (how they say today) who has 'been there-done that'.
The movie should actually be re-made. Not because Audie Murphy's version was not good. He did a marvelous job in playing himself. But because the movie version of Audie's book was not hard hitting enough. It's been accused of being rather 'suger coated'. Too many censors were probably involved in the making of that film in 1954 - 55.  Beut I'm not sure if there is an actor who is man enough to play AUDIE MURPHY out there today. They would have to get an unknown.  Well maybe - just maybe  Matt Damon would be a good AUDIE.",1515715200,,678,4.24031007751938
7740003,5,B01ETYJ4IG,I was born in 1945 so I grew up watching Audie in many of his movies.  There was always a calmness in his demeanor so for me that explains why he was calm under fire and this movie gives you a taste of that by the guy that actually was the central character!!,1515024000,,259,3.8867924528301887

To Hell and Back reads like a novel with great characters, lots of action, a sympathetic main character, moments of humor, and moments of sadness,  what makes that astonishing is that it is a true story and more than that it is a memoir.

The reader is taken on a riveting firsthand account of some of the most fierce fighting of WWII with a humble normal guy who turns out to be an incredible soldier and war hero.

The story is possibly as close to the thoughts and feelings of combat that anyone who has never been in combat can experience.

Personally I would like to see a series about Gabe's now Dante's Daughter. To find out what happens next in Dante's world. Learn what kind of power the daughter of a Necromancer and a Skinfint (?) will have. Will sh take after her mom or  both. Or be some thing new. What with her potential being near as high as Dante's.

7740029,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"To Hell And Back

This 1949 book was a top best-seller for many months. It is dedicated to his two friends who were killed in action at Anzio and near Ramatuelle France. Chapter 1 starts at the invasion beaches of Sicily. A shell explodes, another soldier picks up a man's ammo. ""He won't be needing it."" The Murphy family were very poor share-cropper farmers in Texas. ""Our situation is not to be blamed on the social structure"" he wrote. [But there were no Homestead Laws then.] His father deserted the family, then his mother died. The three youngest children were put into an orphanage. Audie worked at a filling station and a radio repair shop. [Training or education for his future?] He often got into fights at school. Being undersized, he was rejected by the Mariness and the Army paratroops before joining the infantry. [Did combat classification mean higher pay?]

On a scouting patrol he shot two retreating army officers. Next he was promoted to corporal. The actions in battle are recorded. They advance and take casualties. Some descriptions are sanitized for the general public, but you can read between the lines. The soldiers comment on others and tell about their own lives. They advance and take casualties. Life in combat is no picnic, they are often short of food and sleep. But they push on, day after day. Chapter 4 finds them in southern Italy near Mignano. Wounded enemy soldiers are carried to relative safety, little help is possible for them. The enemy retreats, they advance to Cassino. Then they are sent to the rear for a short vacation. They spend time in Naples (Chapter 6). Audie suffers from malaria (Chapter 7). One soldier is shot in the night because he didn't identify himself (Chapter 9). One man is a deserter (Chapter 10). Another of his friends is killed (Chapter 12).

His best friend Brandon is killed (Chapter 14). German resistance grows stronger near the Vosges mountains (Chapter 16). Audie gets a sniper (Chapter 17). Audie is promoted to lieutenant (Chapter 18). A bullet hits his hip. Delayed treatment resulted in gangrene. The Army is now in Germany (Chapter 19). Audie directs artillery fire against the enemy troops and tanks. Then uses the machine gun on the burning tank destroyer against the enemy. [Medal of Honor.] They continue to advance (Chapter 20). They cross the Colmar canal (Chapter 21). There is a close call when three German tanks pass by. The troops are sent to a rest camp. Audie is transferred to liaison duty (Chapter 22). The men march through the Siegfried Line unopposed. They cross the Rhine. Audie is on a rest leave when they hear about VE day. Images of the past play in his mind.

There are 22 chapters in this 274 page book (which has no Index); it is a personal memoir. The last sentence in the book says ""I will learn to live again"". This book does not mention that he was the most decorated soldier in the Army. Or any of his post-war traumatic stress disorders. Audie Murphy, like some others, was cast in Hollywood movier in the 1940s and 1950s, mostly westerns. The 1955 movie ""To Hell And Back"" was the top money-making film until ""Jaws"" in 1975. Given the lowered value of the dollar and the higher admission price, ""THAB"" is probably still first by paid admissions. This movie seems to have been banned from TV since Audie Murphy died in 1971 age 46.",1503964800,,3344,4.730703259005145

I was constantly amazed as his story advanced, about how he (or any GI) survived the war and came back to make something of the life our Lord gave to him.  He did suffer for many years with PTSD, but he kept moving forward, gained a family of his own, and found a new career as an actor.  It was our sorrow to lose him in a plane crash, at an early age (his 40s).  I can't offer enough praise about this book, which, is of course, about his life.

I kept wondering how he got through this without losing his mind, much less his life.  I'm sure he suffered PTSD after the war, they just did not have a name for it yet.

Anyway, I have liked Audie Murphy as an actor (B-rated westerns but also To Hell and Back itself).  He never seemed to think he was a better actor than he actually was (for example, like Sylvester Stallone).  He definitely had PTSD as did many other war veterans (including 2 of my uncles) and I believe maybe the book and its corresponding movie helped him with it?  I want to think so.

I only realized half way through that Audie Murphy is playing himself.  He is a very good actor and seemed like a good man. This would be appropriate for teens and up.  There is a small amount of kissing and men talking about being with women all night, but it is brief.

I've even seen the movie, but somehow thought there would be nothing more to learn by reading it. This is just a fantastic book written by a fantastic man. He was talented but also quite fortunate to make it through given the commitment he had to get the job done. I think I am most impressed with him because his humility is what I've always believed true Americans were all about. That belief has been so badly shaken in the current events, but reading this book told me I was right, that is what America is supposed to be about. America's heroes are real people, humble yet can-do, willing to sacrifice everything for decency and what is truly right... and do it while maintaining total honesty.

His heroism  during the war  was something  that came to him naturally. His goal was to fight the Germans and to protect his men. He never considered himself as a hero. He only did want his job was.  Kill the enemy at the same time keep his men alive. He went beyond the call of duty to achieve his mission.,1484092800,,445,4.2

Murphy's writing is intelligent. He creates the personalities of his fellow soldiers. And I don't think I've ever been so affected by the loss of life in any other war memoir or novel (and I've read most of them including James Jones' trilogy, Mailer - even Tolstoy). This is not about heroics - his description of fear is too real for that. Humour helps the soldiers get through their hell. The enemy, though naturally hated, is treated with admiration and respect. It's not black and white. A real soldier's story.",1481846400,,669,4.36

I've read the negatives and positives for reviews, so basically I'll leave you all with this..... it's definitely a ""guy"" movie. It's crass, ill humored, lots of one liners that I found giving me an ab workout with laughter. For those who didn't like the movie (which was mostly female reviews), HEY! IT'S A MOVIE FOR DUDES.

My father was a WWII veteran (South Pacific, USMC) so I knew that in this war, you were in for the DURATION.  No one knew how long that would be.  Maybe into the 1950's or until there just weren't anymore men left alive to fight.  It may be hard to understand that concept.  He truly went through hell.  It's a miracle that he lived through it.  Lieutenant Murphy does not go beyond the war and the presentation of the Congressional Medal of Honor, nor does he mention receiving any of the medals he was bestowed upon for bravery.  I regret that he didn't tell of the hell he experienced long after the war.  But for this book, I had a hard time putting it down.",1469145600,7,836,4.267515923566879

7740177,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"To Hell And Back

This 1949 book was a top best-seller for many months. It is dedicated to his two friends who were killed in action at Anzio and near Ramatuelle France. Chapter 1 starts at the invasion beaches of Sicily. A shell explodes, another soldier picks up a man's ammo. ""He won't be needing it."" The Murphy family were very poor share-cropper farmers in Texas. ""Our situation is not to be blamed on the social structure"" he wrote. [But there were no Homestead Laws then.] His father deserted the family, then his mother died. The three youngest children were put into an orphanage. Audie worked at a filling station and a radio repair shop. [Training or education for his future?] He often got into fights at school. Being undersized, he was rejected by the Marines and the Army paratroops before joining the infantry. [Did combat classification mean higher pay?]

On a scouting patrol he shot two retreating army officers. Next he was promoted to corporal. The actions in battle are recorded. They advance and take casualties. Some descriptions are sanitized for the general public, but you can read between the lines. The soldiers comment on others and tell about their own lives. They advance and take casualties. Life in combat is no picnic, they are often short of food and sleep. But they push on, day after day. Chapter 4 finds them in southern Italy near Mignano. Wounded enemy soldiers are carried to relative safety, little help is possible for them. The enemy retreats, they advance to Cassino. Then they are sent to the rear for a short vacation. They spend time in Naples (Chapter 6). Audie suffers from malaria (Chapter 7). One soldier is shot in the night because he didn't identify himself (Chapter 9). One man is a deserter (Chapter 10). Another of his friends is killed (Chapter 12).

His best friend Brandon is killed (Chapter 14). German resistance grows stronger near the Vosges mountains (Chapter 16). Audie gets a sniper (Chapter 17). Audie is promoted to lieutenant (Chapter 18). A bullet hits his hip. Delayed treatment resulted in gangrene. The Army is now in Germany (Chapter 19). Audie directs artillery fire against the enemy troops and tanks. Then uses the machine gun on the burning tank destroyer against the enemy. [Medal of Honor.] They continue to advance (Chapter 20). They cross the Colmar canal (Chapter 21). There is a close call when three German tanks pass by. The troops are sent to a rest camp. Audie is transferred to liaison duty (Chapter 22). The men march through the Siegfried Line unopposed. They cross the Rhine. Audie is on a rest leave when they hear about VE day. Images of the past play in his mind.

There are 22 chapters in this 274 page book (which has no Index); it is a personal memoir. The last sentence in the book says ""I will learn to live again"". This book does not mention that he was the most decorated soldier in the Army. Or any of his post-war traumatic stress disorders. Audie Murphy, like some others, was cast in Hollywood movier in the 1940s and 1950s, mostly westerns. The 1955 movie ""To Hell And Back"" was the top money-making film until ""Jaws"" in 1975. Given the lowered value of the dollar and the higher admission price, ""THAB"" is probably still first by paid admissions. This movie seems to have been banned from TV since Audie Murphy died in 1971 age 46.",1464048000,,3343,4.7289879931389365

7740186,2,B01ETYJ4IG,"Fifth and last, but for a short story, in the Dante Valentine urban fantasy (in an alternate world) series and revolving around a necromance and demon assassin.

My Take
Thank god this is the end, because I am so fed up with Dantes wishy-washyness. To Hell and Back takes place mostly in Dante's head and is an excellent example of why the author really needs to work in what happened in the past stories. Although I suspect most of the problem is that I let too much time elapse between Saint City Sinners , 4, and To Hell and Back  turns out I didn't even remember having read this the first time.

Saintcrow does provide driblets of backstory, but not nearly enough to bring back memories of what occurred. I felt lost throughout most of this. It probably didn't help that Dante kept whining. Over and over again. It's a recurring theme throughout as she whines about the traitor she released, Japh betraying her, her own pain.

Nor does it help that Dante simply can't make a move (in a dangerous situation) without lots of questions and too much thinking. The one recurring situation in which Dante doesn't bother with questions is whenever she and Japh set out on an action. Wouldn't that be the time to force some answers? Although, I do like this one bit of insight from Dante:

""There aren't any geographical features that can stop you [no mountain so high as]  the faults, fissures, and peaks inside your own skull that bring you up hard and short.""

She can't exercise practical caution. She's ""trapped"" in a fabulous, well-stocked apartment in Paris, dogged by a bounty set on her head by Lucifer, supposed to be staying low to avoid attention, and her only thought is to get out and walk the streets. Uh-huh.

It's possible that all of this disjointed thinking and writing is meant to emulate Dante's emotional state, but Dante has the advantage over us. She knows her past history.

Saintcrow has an interesting perspective on religion in this series viewing Christianity, Judaism, and Islam as Religions of Submission; Id never consciously thought of them that way but it does make sense. The religion in Dantes day is more personal with individuals speaking directly to their particular god. Other than that*eye roll*it's an interesting world Saintcrow has created with its hovers and magicks.

The Story
Lucifer threw Dante out of Hell when he was done torturing her. Now Japh has plans for her. Plans that depend on Dante escaping the bounty hunters, mercenaries, and demons hunting her down.

Plans that include killing Lucifer.

The Characters
Dante ""Danny"" Valentine is a a demon hunting necromance, a psion, who was once Lucifer's errand girl wearing his Gauntlet and is now half-demon. Before Saint City Sinners , she had served the god of Death, Anubis, unreservedly. But the most important role Dante plays is as Japh's hedaira. Eve also calls her the Key to the throne of Hell. Fudoshin is the name of her katana.

Eve, a.k.a., Omega and Lucifer's Consort, Aldamrimel, the Morning Star, is Doreen's daughter (Dante also thinks of Eve as her daughter), a demon, an Androgyne. Vardimal Santino created Eve using demon genes. Velokel the Hunter is a demon working with Eve.

Tierce Japhrimel ""Japh"", a.k.a., Kinslayer and Eldest, is Lucifer's assassin, Dante's familiar, and a Greater Flight demon, who has fallen in love with Dante and yet betrays her over and over. He died and has come back with his full demon Power.

Japh's team includes
the Hellesvront agents McKinley with his metal hand; Vann, the agent obsessed with throwing the bones; the gorgeous Tiens, a Nichtvren (vampire) and the primary pilot; and, Leander Beaudry, a Necromance sent to keep an eye on Dante.

Lucas ""the Deathless"" Villalobos is a powerful psion of whom other psions are terrified. He's also under contract. Anton Kgembe, a Left Hand theorist, is a ""dead"" Magi and the most powerful one in the world. He formulated Kgembe's Laws, four principles of dealing with Left Hand (blood) magick used by the Hegemony and Putchkin Alliance to deal with miscreants.

Lucifer is the Prince of Hell and was Japh's Maker. Sephrimel was the third Fallen, and his beloved hedaira, Inhana, was assassinated by Japh. The Knife of Sorrow is a weapon, which can kill a demon with but a touch. Anhelikos are sexless pretty spies. An a'sharak is a worm Lucifer implants in a woman to control her. The now-destroyed White-Walled City is in Tibet and was the home of hedaira, women who were beloved of a Lord of Hell  and Lucifer wants them all killed. A Glaive can strip glamour from any demon. The Hedairae Occasus Demonae is an ancient demon-written book.

Demons of the Greater Flight rebelling against Lucifer include Zag and Semma.

Jason ""Jace"" Monroe had been her boyfriend, before he died. Lewis had been Dante's social worker before he was killed by a Chill junkie. Doreen and Gabe Spocarelli (killed by a traitor) had been Dante's friends while Eddie, Gabe's husband, was betrayed by his sedayeen research partner. Jado was Dante's sensei. Polyamour is a sexwitch transvestite in Saint City who is raising Gabe's little girl. Selene is the consort of the Prime of Saint City.

Hegemony is a world superpower with the Putchkin Alliance the other. I think the Hellesvront might be a joint law enforcement agency of both and all are controlled by Lucifer. The Awakening is when people began to be able to speak directly to the gods they worshipped.

The Religions of Submission include
the Gilead Evangelical, led by Kochba bar Gilead, was the previous theocracy which ruled the the North Merican (North America) empire, the Republic. The Gilead was quite Nazi-like in its death camps and persecutions of anyone not them. Christer is the Catholic religion. Islum is Islam.

Hajia Sofya is the Hagia Sophia. Paradisse, Franje, is Paris, France, and had declared itself a sanctuary for psions during the Gilead reign; Notra Dama is a now-buried Notre Dame. Caracaz is Caracas. Sudro Merican is South America. The Vegas Waste was Las Vegas.

Psions collect the power generated by the beliefs of an individual gods believers. A Magi is a psion who has undergone basic training. A Necromance is an accredited psion who can bring a soul back from the Death. A sedayeen is a healer psion incapable of aggression. Shaman is a catch-all term for a psion who doesn't fall into a particular specialty. Clormen-13, a.k.a., Chill, is a drug. I think flits are ghosts.

The Cover and Title
The cover is a stark black-and-white of Dante's head, her eyes looking off to our left with the title in a gruesome red against the black of Dante's hair. The author's name is also in white.

The title is literally and figuratively where Dante has been, To Hell and Back where ""Only a demon can take down the Devil"".",1460764800,,6783,4.830888697152718

7740199,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"Sure wish every adult could read at least some of this book.  The movie is tremendous (wish it had a much bigger budget), but there is so much more in the book.  I am aware that some people will not want to read a few of the graphic sections, where we see through Audie Murphy's eyes what high explosives and machine guns can do to the human body.  Still, Audie Murphy takes a humble, humane approach to his service to America.  Not truly looking to hurt anyone, but understands what war is, and wants to end it as soon as possible.  His primary devotion is to those immediately around him, whom he protects to the absolute best of his ability, even if that means facing the enemy alone.  Maturity beyond his teenage years, but I suppose that comes with being orphaned and having to care for younger siblings.  Most importantly, in the heat of battle, Audie Murphy understands what ""calm fury"" means, and he practices it even when it would be much easier to take a different approach.  It truly is unbelievable that he survived.  A measure of the man is that this book focuses almost exclusively on relationships, strategies, team objectives, etc., only mentioning his personal promotions when necessary, and never mentioning the numerous honors he received.  I'm very grateful this book was written and that I had the opportunity to read it.  Update:  I went back through the book and tried to estimate the number of US soldiers who were killed within a few yards of Audie Murphy, and it is somewhere around 400.  If we include those who were grievously wounded near him, it would be over 1,000.  Of his original platoon that started in North Africa, he was the only one standing at the end of the war.  Of the seven officers involved in the Colmar Pocket battle where Audie earned the Medal of Honor, he was the only officer who survived.  I also tried to estimate the number of Germans he killed in direct combat, and that is somewhere around 90, with a lot of them being killed in one-on-one, cat-and-mouse duels.  He even volunteered to go after snipers.  He went forward, when the rest of his unit was holed up or moving toward the rear.  He grabbed machine guns from crews that were hiding, pulled them into the open, and took the fight to the enemy.  Many times, bullets were hitting so closely that they knocked dust into his eyes.  If you count the air strikes he called in around his positions, he accounts for a total of about 250 enemy deaths, extremely conservatively speaking.  To say it's a miracle he lived through 3 years of this type of fighting is an enormous understatement.  Even among miracles, it's miraculous.  Read the book!",1455926400,14,2650,4.613247863247863

7740201,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"Audie Murphy grew up dirt poor during the depression. His father was a Texas share-cropper and drunkard who would eventually abandon his family. To put food on the table for himself and his 12 siblings, he took to hunting. Coming from a family too poor to own a rifle, he learned how to stalk up to within feet of a rabbit and dispatch them with a slingshot. When he could borrow a rifle, he learned to never waste a bullet. If he fired, he killed. If he got nothing, he went hungry.

The lessons learned from his tough childhood made Audi Murphy one of the most dangerous American in the US Army during WWII. His skill and heroism made him the most decorated soldier of the war. When he returned to America, he became a star of the silver screen. His masterpiece was To Hell and Back, the movie that told the true story of his service in WWII. According to numerous authors, much of Murphy's actual real-life daring was toned down for the movie. It was thought that audiences of the time simply wouldn't believe what this guy did.

Entering the service too young (so he could help provide for his fellow orphan siblings), rejected by the Marines and the Navy as being too wimpy looking, serving in WW2 for only about 2 years, and still earning every US award for combat valor (several of them multiple times),  as well as French and Belgian awards for valor, America's enemies were probably very thankful Audie Murphy was not born a few years earlier.  If he had been born in 1922 instead of 1925 (or 1926 depending on whose story one believes), their butts would have been in a sling within a few weeks after Pearl Harbor, before they could have even gotten a foothold anywhere.  He was a very kind-hearted young man with the unique ability to perform heroic acts of single-handed mass destruction in the most adverse of conditions.  Several rifle companies of Germans and 5 battle tanks?  No problem when you have one Audie Murphy and one disabled, burning piece of US hardware with a machine gun on it.  Truly, Audie Murphy was a walking self-contradiction, quietly describing himself as just another dogface, which is why he wanted his grave in Arlington Cemetery to look no different from anyone else's.  Yet, his is the second most visited gravesite, after JFK's.  Awesome movie, and it should have had 3 or 4 times the budget, to catapult it into being the panoramic epic the man deserved.",1448323200,5,1519,4.789272030651341

This Movie changed me in a way that actually motivated my perspective mindset when I signed up for the Military. So, in retrospect, Audie Murphy actually gave me the drive & motivation to serve as a Combat Vet. with the 75th Rangers Regiment during the Vietnam Campaign, of which I served 2 Tours out of the 6 years that I had served. In retrospect, I would like to summarize that, Audie Murphy was and is to this very day one of my favorite Iconic War Hero's & Western Motion Picture Actors of all time! Therefore,  it is my opinion that after having read his autobiography & viewing, ""To Hell And Back"", one of the best wartime Movies of its time, will undoubtedly give you a different outlook about true Heroism and others like, the Legendary, Audie Murphy.

It's in a way, a cheesy 50s movie, but in another way, one of the more important movies ever made since it's about Audie's efforts in Italy and France that won him so many decorations. Must see for all kids. We've watched it a few times and now will give it to the library so others can see it too. Audie was the kind of Hero that is needed in the world, a humble person who got the job done, a much better role model than what is called a ""hero"" in modern culture.

As far as I know there is only one other World War 2 movie that stars the actual person portraying what he did in WW2 and that is ME Clifton James in the movie 'I WAS MONTY'S DOUBLE',  this is the true story of one of the greatest deceptions of WW2,  ME Clifton James looked so much like GENERAL MONTGOMERY.

The takeaway is that WWII front line men had to essentially see other soldiers as a thing that needed to move forward. The enemy was also not a group of people; they were barriers that needed to be dropped. Rarely does the term ""shot him"" come up. There are so many words used besides the ultimate ""I killed him."" My father was an infantryman. I understand him so much better than I ever thought I could. I did keep waiting for something to happen, to read the other side of the soldiers' lives, but that didn't happen. It is grit from beginning to end. No wonder WWII vets never talked. Their battle fatigue was real. They learned too well how to compartmentalize.",1430265600,7,822,4.3441558441558445

On the 70th anniversary of Audie Murphy's Medal of Honor action I obtained a Kindle edition and reviewed the book and the movie. There are critical differences, and the review highlights these. In fact, the book is a more gripping narrative of Murphy's action in battle and the story of the Third Division. Hollywood was unable to do the story justice.

7740321,4,B01ETYJ4IG,"Urban fantasy follows a known trajectory most times, particularly the romance variation. There's a connection between a human female and some version of an alien male, sometimes an actual alien and other times simply alien as in other. The male is insufferable, manipulative and abusive. The woman is strong but succumbs because deep down she wants to be held by the strength of a strong man. The abuse and manipulation is ignored for safety. There's variations on this but essentially most cover over the horrific connection with heaps of romantic cliches.

This story take that premise and removes the cliches, at least most of them. Gone is love conquering all. Gone is redemption. Gone is overlooking abuse. This is brutal unmitigated destruction at every level imaginable. What would truly happen in a human/alien union with such a ridiculous difference in power and a lack of understanding? What would happen if the manipulation and abuse were not falsely diminished by emotionalism?

The answer is this series. The sheer scope of the lies and manipulation and abuse are not removed. They come into fruition and death results.

7740323,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"I made the mistake of seeing the movie first, and assumed for many years that the book would also be 100% ""Hollywood"" too.  I was wrong.  If you're like me, you will soon start to skip the yuckety-yuk ""Hey Mac!"" dialogue between the characters, and just read Murphy's tale of what actually happened.  That alone makes it simply great.  This unit saw more sustained, daily combat than any other unit in American history.  It was exhausting to read, knowing that they still had so far to go.  Murphy and his co-writer describe and acknowledge PTSD long before it became commonplace.  Few WWII memoirs describe the real horror of the situation like this one.  My father served in the same unit during the war, and this book helped me understand just what he'd been through, and why he'd not speak of it. As heroic as these men were, I look at them all as victims of a true horror.  Murphy has a unique respect for humanity in his tale, and I love how he speaks of seeing the uniform as his enemy, not the man.  It's a must-read for any WWII history buff.  And this is especially true for the history relating to Salerno, Anzio, Rome (or Southern France).  You don't see many memoirs out there for this campaign.",1426204800,,1208,4.490825688073395

I also read a couple other books written by other veterans of the 7th Infantry Regimant in the 3rd Division.  Some of their experiences were even shared.  Murphy's book was written closer to the times, however and ""felt"" different.  Maybe that made the events feel more real and made the details a little more complete.

7740378,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"To Hell and Back, 1955 film

The movie begins with marching soldiers and band music. General Walter Bedell Smith talks about soldiers, some perform beyond the call of duty. This is the story of Audie L. Murphy. At age 12 he was a good shot. His father deserted the family. Audie, the oldest son, worked to support the family and quit school. Then the war began. There is bad news: their mother went peacefully. The younger children must go to a church orphanage. Now Audie will join the military. The Marines, the Navy, and the Paratroopers reject him; the Army doesn't. Audie was acting sergeant on the ship coming over, he inspects the troops. There is rough humor among the troops. Murphy wants combat, he has spirit. He sent his pay back to his family. When the Germans surrender in Tunisia the Third Division is then sent to Sicily. They walk along a road until a German machine gun opens fire. It is neutralized. Sicily was taken in 38 days. Murphy was promoted to corporal.

Next they go to Italy. Corporal Murphy carries a Tommy gun. The bridges across the river were destroyed. Murphy's squad crosses the river at night for an attack. German 88s open up in the morning. The Army continues to advance. After two months they are sent back for a rest. Some soldiers start a fight in a bar. A joint operation? Murphy finds a home-cooked meal. They take part in Anzio, German 88s fire on the troops. They have to retake a tall farmhouse. The rain makes mud, this keeps German tanks away. They take the farmhouse. The artillery observer calls in the tank position so they are stopped and the road is blocked. The old soldiers don't make new friends. They must stop the repair of that damaged tank at night. Murphy is recommended for a decoration. They retreat from the tall farmhouse when enemy tanks advance. Armor and reinforcements allow them to advance. They reach Rome. Then they report for amphibious training. They will land is southern France next.

Murphy's friend Brandon was careless. Murphy knocks out three enemy machine gun nests! They are held back by an observation post. Sergeant Murphy is promoted to Second Lieutenant. They advance until they come under fire. They are near Colmar. It must be taken ""at all costs"" to open the road to Germany. German tanks advance against them so they retreat. Murphy stays to call in the enemy's position, the shells drive the tanks back but their infantry advances. Murphy climbs on to a burning tank to uses its machine gun against the advancing Germans. But he is wounded in the hip. This will disqualify him from West Point. [Murphy's wound did not receive prompt attention, gangrene set in so more damage resulted. Modern medical treatment would have prevented this.] In August 1945 Lt. Audie L. Murphy received the Congressional Medal of Honor and many other medals. He was the most decorated American soldier of WW II.

His book was more informative than this movie. After the war he acted in Hollywood movies, like some other veterans. This movie was the highest grossing movie until it was surpassed by ""Jaws"" in 1975. Movies are rated by the amount taken in, not the number of paid admissions. Given the rise of admission prices, this could be the most popular movie ever. There were other WW II movies made in the 1950s; their tone is different from the wartime movies of the 1940s. Note the commercial in the beginning, where a neighbor recommends joining the military and becoming a ""lifer"" because of the retirement benefits after twenty years.",1415232000,,3514,4.746317512274959

7740390,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"This book by Audie Murphy (and ghost written by David McClure) was published in 1949.

It is one of the best first person World War II narratives I've ever read. Heck, only now I know from where Sven Hassel took a lot of his narratives ideas, the idea of getting soldiers talking histories and anecdotes, including some really funny quotes, instead of filling page fter page with gory battle scenes.

But the battle scenes here, when Murphy narrates them, are indeed violent, bloody, cruel. The writer gives some perspective of on which offensive the skirmish is included, but there is not mention of grand strategy all around, not names of division generals, Army generals, battalion commanders, nothing like that. The only superior officer whose name is mentioned is company commander Captain Hogan.

Also interesting is the fact that Murphy does not mention one single decoration he ever received. Talk about humility (this is in unison with his desire to be buried in a common graveyard in Arlington).

The books focus solely in Murphy's war exploit (with only a brief mention of his very harsh upbringing), and, of course, nothing about his acting career or the personal demons he faced after the war (after all, the book was published soon after the war - 1949).

By the time he was discharged due to his wounds at the age of 19 he had been promoted to Captain and received every medal for valor, some of them more than once, awarded by the United States and two of France's highest honors.

I was fortunate to have my brother-in-law, who was an Air Force veteran, explain to me who Audie Murphy was, and how this was not an ordinary war movie.  I have heard the term 'hero' thrown about for everything from teachers to sports figures, but in my eyes, the definition best applies to those individuals who put their lives on the line to protect others, or to further advance a greater good.  Audie was not the only hero of that war and this movie serves as an example of what our heroes in all our wars are all about.  A real good patriotic movie.  In addition, Mr. Murphy has his story in book form, under the same title, which is also excellent reading.  As an actor,  he has many fine roles and appeared as a lead actor whose genre was mostly westerns.  For this I would recommend ""Seven Ways from Sundown"".",1394755200,,872,4.339506172839506

He was short and too young but showed everybody he was true Hero. For it's time it's not a bad movie. If you like true war stories this one is mostly true.

This isn't a true review because I'm not going to buy the book. Based on the reviews it would be wasting my money as I have to buy 3-5.

I am disappointed that the reviews aren't raving. And yes, I should read it for myself. I'm afraid. Yea, that's how much your characters had stayed with me. I'll read this story if it's free. Might make a trip to the library and see if they have  it.

7740472,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"The book, written by Murphy himself, is very interesting, action packed, and shows the reader the darker side of war. (The darkness of a soldiers mind, when he has given up on living through the war)

Murphy tells the tale of his time during WWII, his missions, the men he fought with, and the thoughts he had through out the war.  Never once does he draw attention to himself in a ""look at me manner"".  The missions he was awarded medals for appear as just another day in the life of a soldier, and i had to go online to other places to read about his heroism.

I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in WWII, Audie Murphy from a personal point, or just the camaraderie of soldiers fighting together in a bleak situation.

One thing I have noticed from most of the books I've read about people awarded the medal of honor, is that they don't seem to dwell on the actions of themselves.  They seem to see it as they just doing their jobs, and most feel like they don't understand how they were the ones to survive.  This book is no different.

7740481,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"""To Hell And Back"" is a fictionalized account of Audie L. Murphy's service in WWII which led him from North Africa to Italy, France and finally Germany. Audie Murphy was the most decorated soldier of WWII who was wounded on several occasions. This movie is, again, a fictionalized account of his service during WWII.

The movie begins with the young Audie, as oldest child, stepping into the shoes of the ""man of the house"" when his father abandoned the family in Depression Texas. Many of the traits of Audie as a leader in combat were fostered during this period when he learned to assume responsibilities and get things done without having to be told. The movie is perhaps simplistic in its portrayal of Murphy's reasons for joining the Army.

The movie itself uses highly fictionalized episodes of his heroic service in many battles in several countries as Audie rose in rank as a result of his own willingness to lead, his courage and his shooting ability - something shared with many rural Americans such as Alvin York, hero of WWI. The movie does a fairly good job of showing the kind of combat men like Audie found themselves in during the war in Europe.

The movie itself is a product of it's time without the overly bloody special effects the ""Saving Private Ryan"" generation is used to. Instead, it often focuses on the bonds between men in deadly combat. There is a scene where Murphy loses his best friend and compares favorably with the real-life loss of Lattie Tipton, Murphy's real best friend. This is an idealized portrait of an American hero without the modern tendency to ""make them more human"" - a euphemism for dragging their memories through the mud.

This is a fine film that, while not historically correct in every way, is representative of the best of American heroism by a man who paid for his bravery with what we'd today diagnose as PTSD. This is a fine film and well worth the viewing.",1386028800,2,1916,4.6765578635014835

Unfortunately, the love only lasted through that first book and never really returned. This final installment had glimmers of hope that the original kick-ass Dante would be back, but in the end it was just a disappointment. I really wanted to know more about Japh and more about demons and the non-human characters & species; so many questions were left unanswered. I also never really understood why Japh fell for Dante or even why she loved him in return (he's a cool character in a non-romantic way, but the way he treats Dante is condescending and emotionally and physically abusive).

The world that is created is amazing. The writing paints a full picture, but tends towards repetitiveness in both Dante's thoughts and in specific word choice (for instance, we all know that Japh has a ""saturnine"" face since we're told so often). The characters are fully drawn and certainly full of flaws like real people.

On a side note, Mr Murphy identified w/Post Traumatic Stress Disorder---PTSD and was a big advocate for research and support for veterans. He suffered from alcoholism, something that many vets who are plagued w/PTSD struggle with. I appreciate this film and am thankful that it exists.

I still watch good war movies like Saving Private Ryan.",1371686400,,468,4.153846153846154
7740521,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"Reading this book for again for the first time in many years, having now seen ""Saving Private Ryan"", as well as the numerous other real atrocities the world throws at you, the battle descriptions in this book are almost photorealistic.  The title says it all -- war is Hell, and that's clear from this book.  Though not an ""anti-war"" book, I don't see how any sane person could read this and not be horrified at what the ""Greatest Generation"" endured in WWII. I admired the stoicism and grit of the author and characters in this book, and I was even delighted at the way Murphy captured the banter and language of the 1940's.  These characters' dialogue sound like they are right out of a Humphrey Bogart movie!

Audy Murphy was assisted, based on what else I've read, by an uncredited co-author for much of this book, though some sections were written by Murphy himself.  Apparently Murphy dictated and the co-author polished.  Also, as with many memoirs, the story is not a history and is not necessarily meant to be 100% factual.  I gather that some of the characters are fictional representations of perhaps several different men, and the names were changed as well.  This does not detract from the book, in my opinion -- in fact, I was surprised that an self-admitted poorly educated individual could write this well, and knowing he had a little help actually lent some credibility to the book, in that it made the whole thing add up better.

The book is a fast read -- more like a 40's detective novel, and less like Faulkner.  I can't explain how the book is able to inspire an admiration for what soldiers endure while at the same time repudiating warfare itself, but somehow it does this.  War is Hell -- if you want to know why, read this book.",1371081600,,1754,4.589743589743589

7740541,3,B01ETYJ4IG,"Lilith Saintcrow came into my life with her ""Jill Kismet"" series. Then I went and read her YA series, ""Strange Angels"", which she writes as Lili St. Crow. I really enjoyed her writing and decided to give this series a chance. Since the series was already over, I felt it would be nice to go through beginning, middle and ending in one reading, without having to wait months for each book. You guys probably know what I mean, right?

From GoodReads:
""Necromance-for-hire Dante Valentine is choosy about her jobs. Hot-tempered and with nerves of steel, she can raise the dead like nobody's business. But one rainy Monday morning, everything goes straight to Hell.
The Devil hires Dante to eliminate a renegade demon: Vardimal Santino. In return, he will let her live. It's an offer she can't refuse.
There's just one catch. How do you kill something that can't die?""

Well, Dante's world is a very different from our own and the same at the same time. Her story takes place around 600 years in the future, where the ""awakening"" has happened. The ""awakening"" was when the world was finally clued in to the existence of Psions, who are humans with psychic talents, such as: Necromances, Shamans, Skinlin and so on..
After the ""awakening"", people were also aware of the existence of Vamps, Shifters and Demons. As well as the Devil, who is the main villain throughout the whole series.

Dante is a necromance, one of the best in the world, and she is also a bounty hunter that goes after psions that use their talents for crimes. She has had a harsh past, abandoned by her parents for being an ""abomination"", raised in a psions school and abused by the headmaster and lost people she loved at an early age. Dante is a broken woman in many ways, people that love her might be able to glue her together, but she is still broken and pieces just keep falling off.

Her world is a world of a very dark past and present. Psions are viewed as abomination by some normals and as a constant danger by others. They were treated as such right after the ""awakening"" and confined to Death Camps. This cruel period of time is reminiscent of the ""Holocaust"" and it is as usual, a very disturbing image to be had.

Besides the dark, there is also the technological aspect of the world. There are hovers, slicboards, Holograms and much more. Lilith has created a very interesting world and plenty lovable for any ""Back to the Future"" fan out there :P

Each book was a struggle on itself. Dante goes through unimaginable obstacles and difficulties and watching her was heartbreaking at times.

There is a love story in the series and it is a very unsual one. That story brought many questions in my head. The first one was: Is this Love or Obsession? - Because it is pretty hard to see the line between those two, it got extremely blurred a lot of the time.

I went through the first 3 books pretty quickly, however the 4th and 5th were a huge struggle for me. Despite liking Dante, she pissed me off many of times, by making a huge deal out of a situation and then getting over it easier than I would. Meaning that whenever she was over it, I wasn't and that made it hard for me to relate to the rest of it. The secondary characters are very interesting and many times much more likable than Dante. I cried for her, whenever she got even more broken and that made me connected to her.

Dante's story is full of betrayals, doubts, darkness, faith, lack of faith, pain, love, hurt and fighting. She a tough and dark character that I felt was interesting to follow, though she did get tiring at times.

I recommend this series if you are a Lilith Saintcrow fan and if you are ready for a read that not at all light.

7740556,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"On January 26, 1945, near Holtzwihr, France, six German tanks and waves of infantry, attacked Company B, 3rd Infantry Division, under the command of Second Lieutenant Audie L. Murphy. Ordering his men to withdraw, Lieutenant Murphy remained forward at his command post, climbed up on a burning tank destroyer and employed its machine guns against advancing enemy soldiers, alone and exposed to their fire from three sides. For an hour, the enemy tried to eliminate Murphy but he continued to hold his position in the single-handed battle until the enemy was forced to withdraw. He then made his way to his company, refused medical aid for a leg wound, and organized a counter-attack that forced the Germans to withdraw further.
Lieutenant Murphy's courage and refusal to give an inch of ground saved his company from encirclement and destruction and enabled it to hold its position until reinforcements came.
Lieutenant Murphy was credited with partipating in nine battle campaigns entitling him to nine Bronze Stars, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star with oak-leaf clusters, many other impressive awards, and his country's highest honor, the Congressional Medal of Honor.
He returned to the US to star in 33 films, most of them westerns because he liked working outdoors. Those who knew him say he was a far better actor than he allowed himself to believe.",1359244800,,1372,5.129464285714286

7740560,3,B01ETYJ4IG,"I've read all five books in this series now and at the end of them my over all feeling is of being betrayed by the author. The books started out with a very likeable, kick ass heroine who had a strong sense of honor and fast paced, action filled adventures. Books 1 and 2 were enjoyable enough that I bought books 3, 4 and 5 for my Kindle together. Book 3 was a disaster. The heroine whinged her way through a repetitive, action-less half plot that actually lifted whole paragraphs from the previous books. Book 4 was back on track, though the heroine still took a lot of abuse from her lover that didn't make much sense, she also seemed to have lost her sense of honor.

For the most part, the other reviews of this book (5) are spot on. There's a lot of action (which is well written and addictive to read) and the author creates a increasingly interesting and well developed futuristic world. However, the main character has been getting progressively less likeable throughout the series and the kick ass, intelligent heroine from the first book has now become a self-pitying beserker, who accepts physical and emotional abuse as a normal part of her romantic relationship. The plot leaves a LOT of unnaswered questions, introduces threads that are simply abandoned, and leaves us with a stunningly unsatisfying ending (I mean...it's WTF bad).

So, whilst the book was readable enough to give 3 stars, I won't be buying any more books by this author. I simply don't trust her any more, if that makes sense.",1358726400,,1509,4.647940074906367

7740568,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"""I am well acquainted with fear. It strikes first in the stomach, coming like the disemboweling hand that is thrust into the carcass of a chicken. I feel now as though icy fingers have reached into my mid-parts and twisted the intestines into knots."" -Pg. 96.

I assume this vivid description was probably written by a ghost writer who helped Audie with the book, but it graphically describes what vivid accounts are contained in Audie' recounting his experiences on the battle field. I roomed in graduate school with a student who had been an officer of a roving band of fighters in the Vietnam war. I would ask him about his experiences and some of his stories of killing prisoners and keeping a small gun in case he was captured in order to take his on life so that he wouldn't be tortured, were chilling. He finally said, ""I cannot explain war to you, you have to have been there to experience it first hand in order to understand war."" His words rung true in reading Audie Murphy's memoir ""To Hell and Back"", and seeing from Audie's eyes, the incredible story of his life on the front line. His division lost 4,500 men over a 7 month period. His friends and companions that he started off with were all killed. At times his determination and drive turned him into a one-man killing machine and his own personal war.

I grew up not caring for Audie Murphy's movies, as this clean-cut young man, with the boyish face, he did not look like the Medal of Honor winner that I pictured in my mind and didn't fit in with the movie roles that he was in as the lead hero. But after reading his book, I watched his movie of the same title of his war experience with a renewed fascination and appreciation for his accomplishments and what he endured. To those that watched the movie too, the book is more in depth and the accounts of the casualties are more graphic. I have never been to war, but I have a better appreciation for those that have given their all after reading his account. We are fortunate to have the latest Medal of Honor recipient, Dakota Meyers, from the adjoining county. After reading Audie's book, I have ordered Dakota's book ""Into the Fire"". This is a true hard-to-put-down book with riveting action. One wonders that if Audie had lived, if he may have beaten Reagan to the Commander In Chief position!",1356134400,9,2320,4.521428571428571

7740575,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"Audie Murphy was an amazing soldier. Think of movies you've seen that showed the exploits of fictional war heroes. Murphy was the real thing. Yet, he chose to write not about his heroics, but about the daily travails of the men in the trenches. It was sobering to read about what he and his fellow soldiers went through as they lost friend after friend. It's almost impossible to put this book down until you've reached the end.",1355616000,,428,4.571428571428571
7740576,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"I have always bee fascinated by WWII and the battles.  Some have said Americans never defeated the Germans when they  had the most men. But to see how we defeated an entrenched enemy that had the high ground and was dug in and fighting to defend their country shows that we were the better fighters.  Men like Audie Murphy gave their all and then some. He grew up having to hunt for food for his family to survive, sometimes only having one bullet meant he couldn't afford to miss.  That skill saved his life when so many of his company were killed in action. Great combat action from the man who was there.  If this was fiction it would be a great story of a coming of age but this is a true story of an American hero. I think its about time for a remake of the Movie to Hell and Back.  The only thing missing from the book is the list of medals he was awarded.",1355356800,,862,4.101190476190476

I have a paper copy that is over 20 years old and to say the least it has seen its finest hour been read many times and needed a replacement, thanks Amazon. I find the comments about Murphy interesting and I feel that most of those that are bad have never seen combat. For those that think he didn't earn the medals he was awarded I recommend you read what is required for them to be awarded, as one reviewer mentioned to receive the Medal of Honor the action MUST be viewed by at least two individuals. I spent 20 years in the Army and I am an Army Brat besides with two tours in Vietnam, not infantry. I am proud to have served in the Army that took a young man like Murphy and turned him into one of the finest soldiers this country has produced.",1354233600,,808,4.088050314465409
7740581,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"After WWII the army realized how few Audie Murphy's it had. Many soldiers just wouldn't shoot at enemy troops, who knew that killing one's fellow man would be so hard. So they adjusted their training. This book while full of what feels like conversations I would have had if I had been thinking it through afterwards, ""would'a said"" etc. is a great read. First because it tells us how the WWII army just kept throwing it's soldiers at the front until they died or were wounded out. Second what it was like to be one of those guys and to see your buddies fall day after day until you become numb and can't even remember people's names. And how with only the minimum of training how short the lifespan of the replacements was. If you lived a week, you might make it out.

Still if you watched ""Saving Private Ryan"" and listened to the banter between Tom Hanks and his Sargent, when they are siting around one night in that farm house reminiscing about past buddies you'll swear the text was lifted right from this book.

This book is not for those who need the big overview map, none are provided, nor those interested in battle tactics, ie why this or that front was opened up, why the Anzio landing was a disaster. It's for those of us who don't have a relative who fought in the war to tell us the stories of that war and this book does that job very well.

7740591,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"Murphy was the son of poor Texas Sharecroppers. His father abandoned the family and Audie's mother was often ill. He was forced to quit school after the 8th grade and work. His mother died and left the family with Audie the oldest boy. Murphy enlisted to help his family. His size would have normally kept him out of the infantry (he was 5'6"" and about 140lbs). One of the greatest stories in the history of the military is that Audie Murphy would fight from Sicily to Anzio to France with the third infantry, spend over 300 days on the front lines and become the most decorated enlisted soldier in American Military History. Murphy would rise to the rank of Lt. on battlefield commissions and the men who fought and served with him said he deserved every medal he won and more. I have met many of these men at ""Audie Murphy Days"" in Greenville,TX. and they all say Audie deserved every medal and more(It is ashame that some reviewers have questioned Audie's medals on this site). Murphy won the medal of honor for holding off a company of 6 german tanks and infantry standing on top of a burning tank destroyer,firing a .50 caliber machine gun, killing over 50 germans and single handedly turning back a german attack. Murphy was on the burning destroyer over an hour and called in artillery fire right on his position. I would suggest going to the Audie Murphy website and reading the actual eyewitness accounts of this herioc action. Audie would go on to Hollywood and make 40 movies including playing himself in ""To Hell and Back"" which until ""Jaws"" came out was the most successful movie ever made at Universal Studios. Audie also wrote songs with Scotty Turner and had country and western hits with ""Shutters and Boards"" by Jerry Wallace and ""When the wind blows in Chicago"" by Roy Clark. Along beside ""With the Old Breed"" by Eugene Sledge, ""To Hell and Back"" is probably the finest personal memoir of World War Two from the view of the fighting infantry soldier. Co-written by David McClure (himself a veteran) the book was completely taken from hand written pages by Murphy. Murphy never mentions his medals and the book is not gory or vulgar(it was written in 1947). Still, ""To Hell and Back"" stands on it's own as one of the great books ever written on a war from the foot soldier's eyes. A must read for the true student of WW Two.",1339113600,,2342,4.591885441527446

I listened to the Audible Audio version of the book and found it to be very well done. Murphy's war-time exploits are almost too much to believe but his story comes across as genuine and the book's style (criticized by other reviewers)is very effective in developing the various characters who served with Murphy. The reader actually gets to know those men better than Murphy himself. Interestingly, the reader would have no idea that Murphy won numerous awards. He does not mention so much as a Purple Heart in the book. Don't read this book for insights into Allied strategy or operational history of the campaigns in Italy and France. Read it for what it is, one exceptional soldier's account of his war. Highly recommended.",1335484800,,875,4.651612903225806

7740600,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"Universal Pictures presents ""TO HELL AND BACK"" (1955  106 min/Color) -- Starring: Audie Murphy, Marshall Thompson, Charles Drake, Jack Kelly & Gregg Palmer

Directed by Jesse Hibbs

Audie Murphy delivers his best screen performance as ""himself"" in Universal's To Hell and Back. Based on the star's autobiography, this is the story of how Murphy became America's most-decorated soldier during WW II. After dwelling on Murphy's hard-scrabble Texas upbringing, the story moves ahead to 1942, when, at 18, Audie joined the army. Within a year, he was a member of the 7th Army, serving in North Africa, Italy, France and ultimately Germany and Austria. One by one, the members of Murphy's Company B are killed in the war, until only three men from the original company are left.

The bulk of the film is given over to Murphy's conspicuous acts of combat bravery, and is highlighted by excellent battle sequences.

From a script by Gil Doud

*  Special footnote: -- Audie Murphy originally declined the opportunity to portray himself in the movie, not wanting people to think that he was attempting to cash in on his role as a war hero. Murphy initially suggested his friend Tony Curtis to play him. They had worked together on three Westerns, Sierra, Kansas Raiders and The Cimarron Kid.

7740601,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"This was one of the best books that I ever read! To read the actual accounts of the most decorated Soldier in World War II, was amazing. I've seen the movie many times, but the book was even more in depth.",1317513600,,205,4.024390243902439
7740602,5,B01ETYJ4IG,this has always been my favorit movie..someone so young with so much courage to do the things he did. even at the end of his life he was a true hero.,1316736000,,149,3.838709677419355
7740603,5,B01ETYJ4IG,I don't think I have ever read a more gut-wrenching account of what it was like to be an infantryman in combat during World War II.  Audie Murphy's style is simple and to the point.  He doesn't brag but simply tells what happened.  The reader is immersed in his experiences from the first page to the last.,1316649600,,306,4.333333333333333
7740604,5,B01ETYJ4IG,Great movie would sugest every one to see it. Great tribute to our men in the service. Audi murphy was only one of the many heroes in WWII but what a great classic.,1316044800,,164,4.0
7740605,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"I bought a copy for us and one for my son in law. This movie is a true story. It tells  Audie Murphy's experience in the war, it is serious with some humor mixed in. It is interesting no one wanted him and he came out the most decorated man.",1309564800,,241,3.82
7740606,4,B01ETYJ4IG,"...Many reviews here... cover most of the ground.  I thought that I would make a few comments on some other issues involved...

...First, Hollywood tried to destroy this film... They wanted to cast Van Johnson in the lead role!  A decade before Johnson looked too old to play the role... and otherwise a hideous miscasting... Murphy still looked like a kid a decade after the fact (check out Google for WWII photos of Murphy to see just how much like a child he really looked)

...Murphy had blown most of the money that he had made in Hollywood... bad loans, investments... other...  He had a strong feeling that this was the role of a lifetime with some of the best money...  For once he disciplined himself and used the money from this film wisely...

...Murphy made countless ""B"" westerns (his comment was, ""Same westerns... different horses..."")  But he could act when given decent material... in an ""A"" western as Jimmy Stewart's kid brother... and most notably with Bill Mauldin (look it up) in The Red Badge of Courage.",1308355200,,1027,4.730337078651686
7740607,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"I just bought the new paperbook edition of this book, I know that I must have read it casually many years ago, likely when I served in the US Army.  But now all these years later, with more wisdom, I really could appreciate the real battle experiences portrayed in the book, the misery, the fight to stay alive, this is a great portrayal and thankfully not a military recruiting book, and thankfully not an anti-war book either in my opinion.
I read this book rather fast, two evenings, and I have a real problem reading books that I buy all the way through.  I was especially interested in his supposed choice of weapons, seems I have a more vested interest in all things m1 carbine, the nice little rifle that shot the non rifle cartridge "".30 m1 carbine"" to be not confused with the M1 Garand.  The m1 carbine was given to support personnel and it seems in the book we find out that Audie Murphy had an M1 Carbine alot, likely due to his stature of only five foot six inches tall, or it could likely have been that was due to his ever increasing rank, but he did use the carbine alot.  Since I am also the same height, and strangely half of my family came from Texas as well from that same time period, I too would likely have been issued an m1 carbine in ww2, it was a popular weapon with a removeable 15 round box magazine, and soldiers carried more than just one mag.  Seems Audie Murphy, not mentioned in the book, actually killed seven snipers with an m1 carbine, though in the book it does mention some work on several snipers with an m1 carbine, to include the day he was shot in the hip and just barely shot the german sniper in time with his carbine when he raised it up with one arm and shot pistol style, of which he was taken to a medic tent for three days before casualties could be evacuated, by that time he formed gangreane in the wound and for a month they pumped him full of penicillin and carved away dead flesh, GASTLY details, he actually returned to combat after that!
You find out in the book that it almost seems his survival for three years of combat was sure luck of the draw, and the acts he performed were nothing anyone else couldn't have performed.  The more I read of the book, I feel that there was a fact one can pick up to combat tactics, it seems alot of the guys that got picked off either exposed themselves, or were not in a good position to keep from catching shell fragments from artillery, and oh that is so true supposedly, one must not expose themselves and must take cover, and the parts in the book about keeping his mouth open for explosions is to prevent concussion death/injury, like popping lungs like a ballon instead of squeezing the air out of an open mouth, I learned that in the army.
So yeah, if a young or older person is in the miltary or considering military service, this book could in theory save their life by learning basic combat survival skills.
I guess I will need to read another book or account of the records of how or for what he received all his medals, just for good reading, cause it aint covered in his book, but that is good, cause those who likely seek glory get it posthumously anyway, I mean, seems all CMH awardees in the last ten years got it awarded after death.  Its good that his awards and suffering got him a movie career, though by the time he died in a plane accident, his career was in decline and the vietnam war was in full swing(1971), you could say that the cmh and his awards left him dead prematurely, where as he could have become a humble farmer or such and died much later a regular citizen.  People should read the book along with seeing the movie, since the movie is a little different, but hey, it's Audie Murphy himself in the movie, a priceless treat never again to likely ever be repeated, soldier to actor, later portraying himself.",1307577600,,3838,4.335654596100278
7740608,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"Reading Audie Murphy's account of his World War II experiences in ""To Hell and Back"" is a surreal experience. I've seen the movie many times, but I only recently bought the book. It always amazed me watching him on-screen realizing he really did these things. Many of the characters in the book seem like stereotypes. They were all real.

Much of this book would seem cliche being written today. What we have to keep in mind is the fact that most stereotypes began as types. The reason these characters appear in so much fiction about war is because they appeared in the reality of Audie Murphy's war. Writers and film makers have copied Audie Murphy's story repeatedly over the years. He set the standard. I don't think any book has ever been written that better captures what war feels like from the perspective of the men fighting it. It's a masterpiece.

There isn't a whole lot I can add. I will only say that this is a book that should be read by anyone with an interest in World War II or the men who fought it. I recommend it highly.",1306108800,,1041,4.445026178010472
7740609,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"I've watched the movie numerous times, and Audie Murphy doesn't need anymore virtues extolled by myself, the movie and his actions above and beyond the call of duty speak for him greatly.  Of course Audie Murphy was humble supposedly in his approach to what he was recognized for, and I for one feel that the movie needs a restoration and even transferred to blue ray, you can see in the dvd that there are little snippets of cut film, seems a little stretched out in many scenes, and I fear it could be because there was 16mm footage only available for some scenes apart from the 35mm originals cause 16mm is what happened to movies cut for television time slots and being able to be broadcast, and what a crime it would be if the entire original length reels were lost or damaged over time, ...don't think it hasn't happened to other movies from about the same era, they barely were able to find enough restorable footage for all the 40's 14 Shirlock Holmes movies with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, one of those movies was down to just one copy left in the world only supposedly able to be played once or twice more.
I'd like Audie Murphy more widely known among Americans, I think there ought to be memorial in Washington D.C., but something other than a statue cause he was a humble man who felt like he just was doing his duty, unless it was a statue of him surrounded by his friends with his arm out stretched protecting his buddies, maybe in a foxhole diaramma, but hey, I'm not an artist.",1304380800,,1499,4.450909090909091
7740610,5,B01ETYJ4IG,The classic All-American story about an authentic hero and a Medal of Honor winner of World War II. Audie Murphy stars in the true story of this young leader of men in the battle against Hitler's Nazi's across Europe. One of my all time military movie favorites.,1303171200,,262,4.595744680851064
7740611,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"To Hell and Back is a GREAT book. It is well written and easy to read. The book is written at the lowest tactical level the squad and then the platoon. The book does not cover the campaigns the 3rd Infantry Division fought in, what you get is the ground level fight. The book covers how the dog faced Soldier lived and fought. The relationships the Soldiers developed are the same as those between Soldiers today. The fighting covers Murphy's outfit from Sicily, through Italy and into France. If you are interested in how the Infantryman slogged on day after day then I recommend this book. What I enjoyed most was the way the Soldiers bantered amongst themselves, I kept visualizing my Father, who was a WWII vet, doing the same thing. The book also confirmed to me that a Joe is a Joe regardless of what generation he belongs too. While today's American Soldier my use different tactical terms, and the profanity has definately evolved, he is still the same as our Fathers and Grand Fathers were.",1303171200,3,999,4.617977528089888
7740612,3,B01ETYJ4IG,"I was a bit disappointed with this one. k I was hoping for some growth of the characters but found none. The ending of this series seemed a bit anticlimactic and I was expecting some big finale and instead I felt like there was something missing. We are left with quite a few unanswered questions. The ending was left open if the author wanted to write more later.

I had a hard time reading this series, the story is good and has kept me going through them all, but the writing was hard. So much detail that I found myself skimming through pages and pages of history detail to get to the story so I wouldn't loose focus. But the storyline was good, even if the ending of the series left something to be desired.",1302652800,,712,4.274074074074074
7740613,4,B01ETYJ4IG,"Ok here we are at book 5.  If you made it through 3 and 4 you probably want to punch Dante in the face.  In book 5 we have a lot of the same of book 3 and 4 but things do change. Let me list pros and cons

pros
-There's finally a conclusion!
-While Dante still doubts everything from the sun to the moon she at least stops whining about it so much
-plenty of action
-plenty of mystery and plot to keep this 5th installment going

cons
-Dante is still doubting everything. Mistrust has been an issue from starting back in book 2(book 3 and 4 having it be the central tone of the book)
-Some questions still unanswered and I would have liked more of a drawn out ending to fully get the bad taste out of my mouth.

SPOILER ALERT!!!

As mentioned Dante still doesn't trust Japh.  As another reviewer stated her loyalty to Eve is mind boggling as Eve has never done anything to prove that she even cared about Dante's life. Japh was always the one to save her.  She at least starts to doubt Eve more but it doesn't make up for the blind faith.

Japh isn't without flaws but he's never made a wrong move. To me that should have been enough for Dante by book 5. It was nice to see in the end things ""worked out"" but like I said I would have liked a little more expansion or a 6th book. I would have also liked that book 5 spent more than the last 5 pages with Dante back to being the same Dante we grew to love in book 1 and 2.

After muddling through book 3 and 4 I was glad I at least got a taste of joy at the end. I wasn't so utterly disgusted with Dante at the end but what I wanted more was a next book now that I saw Dante was back or at the very least a chapter devoted to Dante having her wits about her again.

In the end if you can make it through the plot and action of this series is marvelous.  Books 3 and 4 almost crushed the whole thing but I'm glad I was able to put that aside and finish.",1300838400,,1900,3.893782383419689
7740614,3,B01ETYJ4IG,"If it weren't for the fact that I wanted to complete the series, i would not have bothered, even the 4th installation was slow and painful.  I am left uncleared as to who is Eve's Mother, personally, I do not think Dante is, just a hook for both reader and the poor misguided Dante.  Worst yet, how discouraging that tierce Japh is left without a love you from Valentine, yep, we know she loves him, yes, we know he knows, after all he is a demon and can smell emotions, but would it have been so difficult for the author to put it in black and whte, gray if read on kindle.  Also,  find many great authors are simply extending the storyline in order to either extend the series or to have more profits.  This annoys me to no end, that's why laurel k hamilton is on by thumbs down list.  it certainly is not for lack of talent Litith, so next time write two or three books but make them as good a read asthe first.",1298851200,,914,4.135593220338983

7740616,4,B01ETYJ4IG,"Audie Murphy was a childhood hero of mine so I'm a bit biased.  I always recommend reading the book, that the movie was made from, first.  So read the book too.  It's very cool that Audie Murphy plays himself in the movie.  This movie is a great way to start a history discussion and exploration with your children.",1295136000,,315,4.379310344827586

7740620,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"This is a great war movie, made back in my youth. I grew up watching movies like this and this one is a true story and well made. Audie Murphy was always one of my heroes and he does a good job acting, too.",1292371200,,206,3.7045454545454546
7740621,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"What impressed and surprised me most about Audie L. Murphy's ""To Hell And Back"" is its total lack of strutting and bragging. It is, through all 274 pages, like no other soldier's memoir that I have ever read. Murphy was no strategic genius- the highest rank he ever attained was Major in the Texas National Guard, and he's best known for reaching 1st LT in the active Army- but that's not terribly important here. What Audie L. Murphy is known for, what makes him one of the greatest soldiers in human history, is the fact that he recieved two Bronze Stars, two Silver Stars, a Distinguished Service Cross, the Medal of Honor, Legion of Merit, and the French and Belgian Croix De Guerre along with over a dozen additional decorations. No other soldier in the history of the United States Army has ever been decorated so highly by not only his country but two others. This, the baby-faced young man who was turned away by the Marine Corps and US Army paratroopers because he simply didn't look man enough.

Coming from an extremely poor and broken home, Murphy ran into so much trouble, so much adversity, before he ever got to the battlefield for the first time that many, many lesser men would have at some point along the line said ""It's not worth it"" and quit. But Murphy kept going, and instead of becoming a cook he became a soldier who earned the kind of bragging rights most of us only dream of. But that's got a lot to do with his book, and my review. He never mentions any of that. Neither Croix De Guerre, none of his Silver Stars, not even his Medal of Honor is even mentioned. What I found so remarkable about the telling of ""To Hell and Back"" is that it is written by a man who sees himself as just another dog-faced grunt in the infantry. Not one of the most decorated soldiers in history. He tells of childhood and all its woes, of the early breakup of his family due to his father's desertion and his overworked mother's death, and then of his struggle to get to the fighting of World War II. His decision to ""stick by my guns"" from the very start saw him evade repeated attempts to ship him off somewhere where he'd never hear a weapon fired in anger, and he ultimately saw all the war anyone could've wanted and more.

Murphy writes of battles, of soldier's humor and bravado, of the tremendous bravery of ordinary men doing extraordinary deeds. He writes of good friends and comrades, too many of whom died before the war's end. He also writes of the German enemy, speaking of him with no particular hatred in his heart. The Germans wanted to go home alive, so did the Americans. The Germans were scared and hungry, and so were the Americans. Murphy recognized this. And while he does mention the actions that earned him so many decorations, he speaks of himself and his own deeds so rarely, with such humility, that it seemed he was saying, ""This is what happened, this is what my friends did, and if anybody was a hero, it was them. Me? I was there. That's all.""",1285459200,6,2983,4.451553930530165
7740622,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"One of the finest war films ever made. Cheesy at times but for the era that's to be expected. Audie Murphy can only be described as incredible. The guy makes it thru the war alive becoming the most decorated soldier of WWII. Then writes a book and re-lives the war again on film. Except for the guys in our armed forces, today's youth has no idea what it's like to fight for something.",1284249600,2,385,4.287671232876712
7740623,5,B01ETYJ4IG,Excellent.  Saw this in the 50's.  I viewed it and sent it to Iraq.  Sent it to the LT that has Audie Murphy's platoon(no joke).  He has his great soldiers will get a kick out of it.  Quick shipping also. --Jack,1281484800,,211,4.048780487804878

7740627,5,B01ETYJ4IG,THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING MOVIE. ACTORS WITH THE ABILITY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE OF A DYING BREED BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING HEROS AS IN THIS MOVIE ARE JUST ABOUT GONE. I THINK OUR COUNTRY AS A WHOLE HAS FORGOTTEN WHAT IT HAS TAKEN IN LIVES MOST ESPECIALLY AND ALL OF WHAT PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH TO GIVE US THE FREEDOM THAT WE HAVE TODAY.

7740628,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"I saw this movie on the Silver Screen when I was a kid.  A lot of us joined up for the Vietnam war so we could be like Audie Murphy.  This movie didn't have the cast of Thousands and all the Computer generated action of Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers.  What it did have was the REAL DEAL.

7740629,5,B01ETYJ4IG,To Hell and Back is an excellent movie about Audie Murphy's life. He is truly one of America's Heroes as shown by his actions on the battlefield. Audie is not only a good soldier but as it turns out he is a good actor as well. He holds his own with the other professional actors in the movie. The action scenes are good but could be more if you're into action. All in all it's a good choice to learn about the men who fought the second world war.,1277337600,,446,4.022471910112359
7740630,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"Sixty-one years ago, a young American who'd fought in the war published an unpretentious book, ""To Hell and Back.""  It was the story of his experience in World War II as a combat infantryman.  Nowhere in the book does the author mention that he was the most decorated US soldier in the Second World War, or that he'd won the Congressional Medal of Honor, along with 21 other medals.  He barely notes that he rose from buck private to lieutenant (though he never says if he became a First Lieutenant, though it's hard to imagine that he didn't).

On V-E Day, the author - Audie Murphy - was not yet 21, though he'd seen almost nonstop combat from the first wave of the Sicilian invasion to the end of the war outside of Munich two years later.  An orphan who grew up on a hardscrabble Texas panhandle farm during the dust bowl depression, he'd volunteered for the Marines as soon as he'd turned 18.  ""Too small,"" said the recruiter to the scrawny, baby-faced young man.  So he volunteered for the Airborne, and was again rejected.  ""Too small, Murphy.""  And he was small, but he wanted to fight - to fight for his country, and perhaps, to fight to prove that he wasn't really too small after all.

Having failed to enlist in the two ""fightingest"" units of the American military, Murphy joined the Infantry.  He arrived in North Africa right before the end, but the Germans and Italians surrendered the day he was going into the line to see combat for the first time, forcing him to wait for Sicily two months later.

There isn't an ounce of braggadocio in Audie Murphy's chronicle of war, and though he was scarcely educated, even by the standards of the day, he wrote his unpretentious memoirs in the most literate and evocative style I've encountered.  All of those fabled ""writers"" who went off to war, seeking to learn some deep inner truth and share it with the world, how they must have envied Murphy's honest, moving words.

Within minutes of landing on Sicily, his unit took their first fatality, courtesy of German artillery - and from the start, Murphy began learning the lessons that kept him alive.  He realized that the dead man had let his guard down, and in two years of hard fighting, Murphy never did.
In combat, Murphy soon had to fight two opposing forces - the need and want to be close to the men who shared life and death with him, and the need to remain distant from men who were doomed to die or be disfigured or dismembered.  Not one of the men Murphy landed with in Sicily were still in combat with him when his war ended in the occupation of Munich.  He lost so much - but he did not lose his soul.  He indeed went to Hell and Back, but the important thing is, he did come back.

As a soldier, Murphy was a hard man.  He knew that a wounded German was a dangerous German, and if they would not surrender, he had no qualms about shooting them as often as he needed to until the risk went away.  He could never forget that his best friend was gut-shot and murdered as he stood to take the surrender of eight German soldiers - men whose fanaticism was such that they'd betray that most basic of trusts, the one that allowed men to surrender to others who'd just tried to kill them - and whom they'd just tried to kill.  An instinctive shot, he seldom had to shoot them very often.  But he was not a war criminal, or a murderer in any sense of the word.  Germans who surrendered to him were treated honorably and well, and the wounded he took prisoner got the same rough-but-gentle medical care as did his own men.

Yet he was also a gentle man.  For those of his comrades who - after all the heroism and courage they could give - cracked under artillery fire, or after the sight of one more friend eviscerated by a German mortar shell, Murphy was solicitous, understanding and caring.  One man, who couldn't bear to be thought a coward, kept cracking, and being evacuated, then coming back.  To save his friend, Murphy called the Colonel and read him the riot act about sending this man back.  Lieutenants did not read Colonels the riot act, but to save a friend who'd given more than he'd had to give, Murphy would fight bureaucracy as sternly and as effectively as he'd fight the Germans.

In combat, Murphy earned 22 medals, including the Medal of Honor.  Yet the reader is left to guess which distinctive action won him that highest medal.  My bet is the time he mounted the rear deck of a burning and abandoned American Tank Destroyer - a kind of thin-skinned tank with no roof on the turret, but with a bigger main gun than could be carried by a more heavily armored tank.  On the turret's top was mounted a .50 caliber heavy machine gun, and standing with smoke swirling around him, and open flames warming his feet for the first time all winter, Murphy single-handedly stopped a German counter-attack.  They could never find him to shoot him, for the simple reason that no sane man would stand on the back of a burning TD, one packed with heavy artillery shells and filled with hundreds of gallons of high-test gasoline, all seconds away from fireballing.

But there were at least a half-dozen other incidents that could have won him that most honored of medals, and the reader is left to guess, and to wonder, because Audie Murphy never gives a hint.

In the bitter winter of 1944, while facing down fanatical Germans in the Vosges Mountains on the border between Germany, France and Switzerland, Murphy was shot - apparently the only serious wound he received.  He says he was shot in the hip, though his comrades joked that he'd gotten shot in the ass.  It took him three days to move from front line to aid station to field hospital, and by that time his wound had infected and turned gangrenous.  Doctors had to pump him full of antibiotics and carve away the dead, necrotic flesh as the gangrene ate it, for two full months.  This living hell was dismissed in a short paragraph, a few evocative but uncomplaining sentences.  All we do know is that, as soon as he could, two months from being shot, he was back in the line, freezing off what the Germans had failed to shoot off.

There were no easy battles for Murphy.  Some consider Sicily a cake-walk, but Murphy lost his first friend within minutes of going ashore.  Nobody considered Salerno, or the Gustav line, or Anzio a cake-walk, but many considered the invasion of the South of France to be a walk in the park. I should have known better - in 1973, right out of college, I worked with a man who'd won the Congressional Medal of Honor in the South of France when, as a sergeant, and after all of the unit's officers had been killed, he held together a company of Americans who'd been cut off and surrounded - and held them together as he'd held off the Germans for a week before relief came.  This wasn't Murphy, this was a man I'd known.

So I knew - or should have - that the late-summer 1944 invasion of the Riviera on the South of France wasn't easy, or safe.  It was in France that Murphy paid the highest price in lost friends - those few who were left from the men who'd left North Africa for Sicily 13 months before - of the entire war.  It was made more poignant because there were so few left, and because even the replacements of the replacements of the replacements were now so few in number.

At the time that Murphy's unit breached the Siegfried Line and entered Germany, Murphy had been taken out of combat and assigned as a courier, running messages between the Division's rear-echelon headquarters.  He was safe, secure, and ... and he ordered his driver to take him as close to the line as possible. Then dismounting, he walked through the Dragon's Teeth and bunkers until he found what was left of his own company, cowering in a ditch, as demoralized as he'd ever seen them.  Standing on top of the trench, in full view of any Germans who'd cared to look, he cajoled and prodded and kicked and cajoled again, and got the remnant of that battle-shocked company out of their safe trench and on the march.  Then he led them through the rest of the Siegfried Line and into Germany.  Once they'd accomplished their assigned task - only because of his leadership - he left them and marched back, unprotected, unafraid and unharmed, through the Siegfried Line, back to his jeep, and back to headquarters.  They'd never missed him.

Soon enough, he was back with his beloved company, leading them as part of the tidal wave that swept through Germany in the last 8 weeks of war.  Finally, he was given a furlough, and was on a train heading for the French Riviera when V-E Day was announced.  And it was in France that he forced himself to abandon cynicism and embrace the return of life - and to complete the journey he took, the journey to Hell and Back.

It would take a wonderful book to do justice to this hero's war, and I encourage you to read it, one of the best and most evocative war books I've read in more than fifty years of reading war books.  I grew up in that generation just after the war; I remember a legless friend of my father's coming over to use our backyard swimming pool for exercise. I can still see him - though the last time I saw him was the summer after the first grade - unbuckling his artificial legs, apparently unselfconsciously, crab-walking across the patio and plunging into the water.  I can still remember my uncle, whose ship had been Stuka'd in the Med - the scars of shrapnel and fire still mark his face to this day.  My father never told me of the four Kamikazes which had attacked his ship (or the one that hit - then bounced off - before exploding).  Men of that generation, those who didn't write books, didn't talk much about the war.  But as a kid, I saw the evidence of war carved into the bodies and faces of men I'd grown up around.  I have a sense of what they went through.

But Murphy leaves no doubt.  He saw no glory, no heroism worth banners and bugles, though a grateful nation showered him with awards he never even mentioned.  He did his duty, led his men, fought his battles, defeated his foes and did his part to win the war and protect the country he so clearly loved.  His book tells this story, and it is worthwhile.

After the war, the unquestionably handsome Audie Murphy became a Hollywood film star - even playing himself in the movie adaptation of his memoir.  Surely, that must have been surreal.  And tragically, after surviving all that the Germans had thrown at him, Audie Murphy was killed in a plane crash in 1971.  He was just 46.

That fact brought to mind another soldier - a paratrooper named Carter - who also began his war in Sicily, also fought in Italy and France and Germany - and who died of cancer, of all things, just a year or two after the war ended.  Before he died - before, I presume, he knew that he would die, Carter wrote an unforgettable book, ""Those Devils in Baggy Pants.""  That was a story of paratroopers, of men Audie Murphy was too scrawny to join.  Each man gave his all, and it was enough to defeat Germany, but not enough to live in peace for generations after the war ended.  They were all heroes, but none more consistently and effectively heroic than Audie Murphy, who fought for his country, gave his all more times than I could count, and indeed, went to Hell and Back.",1269907200,15,11286,4.4364694471387

7740639,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"An American Hero
I had read Audie Murphy's To Hell and Back many years ago and always marveled at the man's incredible unassuming nature.  After a recent POW-MIA commemoration I annually attend, I decided to revisit the heroism of Audie Murphy.  The autobiography is the essence of combat in World War 2.  It is even more poignant in that Mr. Murphy does not elaborate on his own heroic actions but rather simply tells the story of a front line combat solider and those who he had the honor to serve with.  Now don't get me wrong, the actions that caused him to be the most decorated American soldier of WW2 are all written about, but never once did Mr. Murphy state that he was awarded any medals for his extraordinary heroism.  Rather, Audie Murphy simply writes as one who was there.  He talks about his friends and fellow fox hole mates not just as gritty combat vets, but as men who were asked to do a very dangerous job and who accepted their nation's challenge with dignity and grace.  The personal battle scenes are gritty and graphic and not for the squeamish, but then that is the nature of war:  Ugly, messy, smelly, dirty, and stalked by the specter of death, yet boring and loving at the same time.  All of Audie Murphy's original company mates were either killed or grievously wounded, and sadly in the end only he survived to see VE Day on the field of combat.  Audie Murphy was a true American hero of mega proportion whose heroic feats will be long remembered.

This autobiographical book is a memoir of  Audie Murphy's World War 2 experiences only.  It does not cover his entire life before or after his heroic service during World War 2.  It covers all the battles that Mr. Murphy fought in but does not specifically delineate which awards he received for which battle.  This is in character with the unassuming nature of the man.  For more on which medal Mr. Murphy earned for which particular act of heroism, you will have to visit the various Audie Murphy web sites.  Needless to say, not delineating the specific medal to the specific battle does not detract from the excellent nature of this fine memoir.

Must Read for WW2 buffs.  Highly recommended for everyone else.  One of the very best personal combat sagas of World War 2.  In the same league as E.B. Sledge's With the Old Breed, Robert Leckie's Helmet for my Pillow, and William Manchester's masterpiece Goodbye Darkness.  Simply an American combat classic.",1253404800,5,2439,4.649532710280374

7740641,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"TO HELL AND BACK is arguably the one of the best  World War II movies ever made.  And what makes this classic film so very special is that it is a true story.  The events portrayed in TO HELL AND BACK are real, as they actually happened, without any Hollywood embellishment.

After the death of his mother and at the tender age of 16, Audie Murphy, received special permission to enter the Army infantry, after being turned down by the Marines, the Navy, and the paratrooper corp.  Young and small for his age, Audie's squad mates felt the need to watch out for him, but soon Audie was taking care of them.  His quiet commitment to doing what was right, to doing the best job possible at all times, along with his heroism led to a series of promotions, and finally a battlefield commission.  His final mission earned him the Medal of Honor and made him ""the most decorated soldier in America.""  Unfortunately, a leg wound from that final mission also ended his military career, and at the age of 19, after just 27 months of combat action, Audie Murphy was honorable discharged from military service.  After the war, Audie Murphy became a B-movie star, making over 30 Hollywood westerns and other films, including TO HELL AND BACK, his own biography.

TO HELL AND BACK is straight forward telling of Audie Murphy's life.  Simple and honest, TO HELL AND BACK portrays his affection for his comrades, his innate goodness, and his love of family and country.  I do not normally care for war movies, but this is one that I would watch again and again.  A story of outstanding heroism and bravery, TO HELL AND BACK is not to be missed.",1251590400,4,1629,4.556701030927835

7740647,3,B01ETYJ4IG,"I had originally read the first two books of this series years ago and loved them. After years of the remaining 3 books sitting on my bookcase I finally decided to complete the series. I was unfortunately very disappointed and was glad when I finally completed the series.

I really liked Dante's strong and honorable personality in the first two books and how she resolved the issues placed before her. However, Dante became more unlikeable as each book progressed, until I couldn't stand her in To Hell and Back. Dante is a rage filled, idiotic, untrusting, immature, hypocritical b*****. Dante seems to have no qualms about killing anyone and constantly has the desire to stab or kill people if they so much as talked when she was in a 'mood', her lover and teammates included. She has a very strong dislike for anyone who lies or betrays her. This is very understandable but she lies and betrays those close to her without a problem so she has no right to point fingers. She treats Japh horribly and doesn't trust him despite him constantly proving he would do anything to protect her. Granted, Japh doesn't explain everything that is happening but I don't recall an instant when he blatantly lied to Dante despite her insistence that he has. What I cannot comprehend and what horribly frustrated me is that Dante seems to believe whatever Eve says but won't even trust her lover who has proven his loyalty. Dante even goes so far in her trust with Eve that she is willing to fight and kill Japh to protect her.

Another issue I have with this series is all the things that were left unresolved and unexplained. I did like the overall plot of the series and I feel Saintcrow did a wonderful job in portraying a world where magic, demons, and gods are considered normal, but it seems like Saintcrow felt like the readers didn't deserve answers and closure. Why did Anubis ask Dante not to kill Mandy, what exactly is a Fallen and a Heidara(spelling?), who exactly IS Japh, why does Japh have a gray streak and wrinkles once he came back from hell, and what exactly is Vann and Maxwell? There are many other questions I have that were never answered but those are the main questions that come to mind. I really liked Japh as a character but it does not further your plot when the character with all the answers never reveals those answers. It almost seems like Saintcrow didn't know the answers herself so used the easy way out by using Japh.

Unfortunately, I was so utterly disgusted with Dante and the end of the series that I never plan to read a Lilith Saintcrow book again. The reason I have such strong negative feelings for the last few books is because I REALLY liked the first 2 books and feel very let down as a reader. The reason I gave To Hell and Back a 3 star rating instead of something lower is only because of the first two books in the series.",1243814400,17,2864,4.525096525096525

Murphy was, indeed, a hero. A hero who saw and experienced indescribable horror while still in his late teens. His persona was forged by many months of combat, and his eyes - the eyes of a man who'd seen too much - reflected that in all his films. I recommend the film as entertainment, and also as a piece of history. The story of a man from ""The Greatest Generation"" who gave so much. Perhaps too much.",1227571200,4,751,4.740458015267175

One of his wives once said that Murphy always slept with a .45 automatic under his pillow and would have nightmares where he called out the names of dead buddies.  SGT York is revered for basically one battle.  Audie Murphy was involved in every campaign from North Africa to Germany.  While the movie depicts real events, some are somewhat toned down.  While he did shoot down the German who killed his buddy in real life Murphy fired so many rounds into the guy that he literally blew him to pieces.  His final action, jumping on a burning tank and holding off a German advance does not quite show the incredible courage of this soldier.  He held off that attack for nearly an hour.

7740658,3,B01ETYJ4IG,"I was dying to read this book. I anticipated some amazing work on part of the author to bring her protagonist back from the emotional, physical and mental hell she had left her in. I wanted to see resolution of the many, many loose ends from the last four books. I wanted to a character who, literally, dragged herself from the depths of hell into triumph.

What did I get? More of the same from book four. Dante is still completely effed up. Still has no idea why Japh is with her, what's going on, what's happened to her, who's her friend, who's her enemy, what any of it means. So I was left with a character that is nothing less than pathetic. I just felt sorry for Japh, stuck with what amounts to an incredibly damaged permanent appendage.

I read and enjoyed the first 4 books but this one left me very reluctant to give time or space to any of the author's other books. I read Steelflower and enjoyed it also. However, its two main characters had many similarities to Japh and Dante. The similarities were enough that I wonder if this kind of damaged character and relationship is Saintcrow's ""writer's kink."" The kind of issue that shows up in the majority of an author's work.

As far as the writing style it definitely lacks flare and, at some points, you feel as though you need to put it down for a while just to take a break the from the abuse of English grammar.  However, this man's heroics and peril he endured during the course of his service is so compelling that it far overshadows any literative misgivings.

7740663,3,B01ETYJ4IG,"This is the 5th (and last) book in the Dante Valentine series by Lilith Saintcrow.  It was okay; not as good as some of the previous ones, but okay.

The book starts with Dante (Danny) being expelled from Hell in an alley; she has taken quite a beating from Lucifer and can't remember much of it.  Lucas comes to her rescue and Danny is soon reunited with Japh.  Danny finds that in her absence Japh has been tearing apart the world looking for her, and he has declared rebellion against Lucifer. In order to kill the devil Japh is determined to get a special knife that was made for hedaira to wield against demons.  He has determined that Danny will use it to kill the Lucifer.  Of course Japh, is also out to kill Eve and Danny is hell-bent on protecting Eve.  Danny exerts her independence against Japh and makes a ""hell"" of a mess out of everything...again.

There were a lot of things about this book that bothered me.  I don't understand why Danny is so blindly faithful to Eve; Eve jerks her around just as much (if not more than) Japh.  Danny is not blindly faithful to anyone; why should she be faithful to Eve? On the flip side Danny is horribly unfaithful to Japh.  I don't understand why.  Both characters lied to her a ton; yet only one of them was supportive of her.

By the end of this book I really, really disliked Danny as a character.  She was a physical and emotional mess the whole book.  She rarely took any action on her own.  When she did take action, the action she took seemed to be thoughtless and to just be an excuse to use power. Danny basically screwed up through this whole book.

While Japh is not a perfect character; he seemed to act at least consistently throughout the book.  It would have been nice to know a bit more about Japh and his past.  It would have been nice to know more about why Japh fell for Danny.  The only explanation he gave was that ""She treated him like a human""; you can't tell me that that has never happened before to him in all of the thousands of years he has existed.

For some reason a lot of this book kind of got under my skin and irritated me.  Maybe it was too drawn out or just too inconsistent.  It left you with more questions than answers.  While it was a decent ending to this series; I think it could have been better.  Maybe Saintcrow will write a series about Japh or Lucas; I think they were much more interesting than Danny.  I guess we will see.

How many times has he to prove her that he loves her, cares for her just to have her run away again just because she has this kind of infatuation with Eve? Even when she's proved who Eve really is, she still keeps running from Japh to her. And every time when she founds herself into trouble, she just begs for him to be there. Which he does. To be scorned again by her.

It get to its weights when (spoilers ahead) she prefers to jump from a tower and kill herself before going back to him because he's tried to pull a move on Eve and get her killed. She is gonna die when she impacts against the floor, and Japh just jumps after her saving her. He getas attacked, and then she goes mad because she loves him and tries to help him before losing concience. Japh tends to her lovingly, and when she gets up you expect her to behave better than just trying to smack him, hurt him and run from him just because she has to come back to Eve.

It worked ont he previous book, because it was understandable, but on this one... it became odd after half book like this. It looked like there wasn't enough plot to pull a whole book and all revolved around the above stated.

All in all, when I put all the five books onthe balance I found I'm in love with them and with the story they tell, and I don't regret having read this book, as it gives closure to the story. And I loved the work of Lilith Saintcrow so much that I'm waiting for her next book, NIGHT LIFE, to come out. This author is this good, after all! ;)",1204416000,6,1786,4.171014492753623
7740667,3,B01ETYJ4IG,"Overall an inspired series.  I enjoyed Dante Valentine, her transition into human into hedaria and the events following it kept you at the edge of your seats.  It was only towards this last two books that I found myself getting irritated at her.

Her blind faith in Eve--didn't Jeph deserve some of that?  She kept telling him she trusted him but negates it with her actions.  She totally cut loose of everything. Flaws I could swallow, she was trying to adjust to her situation and she had some hard knocks But blind stupidity was just too much.  Didn't Jeph's actions deserve much more credit? The bottom line is he went to hell and back for her.  Gave up everything.  Kept her alive.  In my book, that is a 5 star rating.

Who was Eve?  Consort?  Carrier of a smidge of Dante's DNA?  Didn't Dante realize that she was a DEMON too? Lies and deceit.  Couldn't she tell the difference in HER actions to those of Jeph?  Sheesh, It gets me worked up.  I'm not even gonna get started on the ending.  I truly WISH that there would be a follow up.  Just way too many loose ends.",1203465600,11,1073,4.3604060913705585

The Anibus/beleiver concept seems to give a hint at possible future events. I really can't wait for the next book!

The Eve storyline - whao! it's getting complex and that's a good thing considering how the demons are in the book. Keeps you guessing.

7740670,4,B01ETYJ4IG,"I gave this book four stars because I think it was a good book, but it might have deserved less. Saintcrow has been pretty consistent in everything up until this book. In the second book the main character did become whiny and that seemed unlike her, but it didn't last too long and in the other books Dante acted normal again. But in this book Dante seems so out of character. I understand she was tortured between books, but Dante makes horrible decisions that just messes up plans for everyone. She is being difficult for pointless reasons and, more times than not, her reasoning doesn't make sense. She's hooked on certain points throughout the whole book. Some points are justifiable but most of them are just foundless obsessions that don't seem to belong. And she's whiny again.

But this is a must read for the end of the series. I would recommend buying it, even if it's just to complete the series. It was good overall, and I will say that I will miss the series, and mourn its finish. I will read Saintcrow's other series, too.",1203033600,,1038,4.550802139037433

If you thought Dante to hard to tolerate in the prior books was painful, think about how unstable she is after spending six months a guest of the Prince of Hell.  She has been tortured within an inch of her life, and all because the Lucifer needs bait to rein in those rogue demons of his.

There is alot of violence in these books. There is also alot of ups and downs in the romance between Japh and Dante. We are left with a hint of the possibity of more to their story, which I would like to see.

I found myself drawn in to the story right away and eager to read the next book as soon as it came out. The story makes you care about Dante and company right away, and the supporting characters, Gabe, Eddie , ect are great additions to the back story of Dante's history and her personality.

Japh is a work in progress in the relationship department. As a demon there was no true gentleness in him before he fell. And it is hard to watch him struggle to be what  he is and what he thinks that Dante needs him to be.

7740678,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"In To Hell and Back, Dante starts out broken yet again, but this time the damage is so severe that she is barely holding it together consumed by rage and walking a knife edge of insanity.  Even as victimized as she begins in this book, this rage is so much better than the last books where Dante spent all her time whining. But even coming from this shattered place, somehow her survival instincts finally kick in and this time she's fighting back . It helped this book immensely that Dante's inner voice, toughened up and her fight to retain her sanity is ultimately what gives her the strength to resist being taken over first by Japh when he seeks to impose his will on her and later by the Devil in their final battle. It also helps that while Dante is still a piece in the game between Japh, Eve and the Devil - be it pawn or queen--Dante tries to make her own moves and that, even being heavily manipulated by all around her, she is still the one to make the winning move.

There is plenty of action in To Hell and Back but, as in the last several books, it is still Dante's relationship and interactions with Japh that intrigue me. Japh is not a romantic hero, he is demon and he is ruthless even though that is easy to forget during the times that he treats Dante with such care.  Though Japh's emotions are subtle and quite contained, we see more range and much more vulnerability from him here.  We see the anguished guilt he carries as Kinslayer - and now  we understand the full impact of  what he wrought in slaying all the Hedaira's.  An encounter with Sephrimel, a Fallen that has lost his Hedaira, really brings home the magnitude of Japh's love for Dante and the risk of being Fallen.  This means that though it looks like his relationship with Dante may never be the partnership Dante desires, Dante still does hold some power.  She has the ability to hurt Japh with her inability to trust and accept that he will always act though long reaching plots and subplots in order to keep her safe.  But as much as it pains him, he will risk her hate to ensure her survival, and trust that he has the rest of eternity to win back her love and forgiveness.

I am not ready for this series to end, Saintcrow has created such a detailed world and fleshed out characters so well and there are still elements of the story left to be explored and explained.  I would like to have a few more of the dots connected.  I would like to have been there when Japh finally explained everything to Dante.  Mostly I would have liked a slightly different ending than oddly unsatisfying epilogue, which left Dante with at best an uneasy happily ever after. But the ending was still open ended, so maybe someday we'll see Dante and Japh again as I still think that there is more of the story to be told for Hedaira and Fallen. With that hope, I will continue hunting for hints and trying to find my own answers. I enjoyed the book and the series. Goodbye, Dante.",1200182400,5,2954,4.366788321167883

My problem with the last two books, Saint City Sinner and this latest and I assume final book, To Hell and Back, was that they left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  There were too many questions left unanswered.  What was Eve?  Was she really Danny's daughter?  Why does Danny think Japh betrayed her?  Why is she full of such self-doubt and confusion about his loyalty?  He is fallen.  What doesn't she get?

The action and unraveling plot kept me glued to the pages. If you love the story between Dante and Japh as much as I do, you will love this book.

Now to the negative part. I was disappointed at how many open-ended questions the author left in the series. So many questions should have been answered, I think we deserved it--it being the last book and all.

But to my disappointment, many questions were left unanswered. Even more annoyingly, some new questions were created and left unanswered. Like (spoiler alert) why Japh appeared to have aged.

7740683,3,B01ETYJ4IG,"This review contains SPOILERS

I gave _The Devil's Right Hand_ two stars because that was the ""Dante gets whiny"" book, and I gave _Saint City Sinners_ three stars because she started doing things again, even though she was still whiny.  I keep this one at three stars because her state of mind was still irritating ('on the brink of complete mental and emotional collapse' is not particularly better than 'whiny'), and because it seemed to me that a) Dante's actions didn't make all that much difference, b) I didn't understand the climatic scene very well and c) too much important stuff seemed unresolved.

Maybe I'm dense, but I just did not get why Dante was only able to kill Lucifer by becoming the avatar of two gods.  She had the knife, she had shown the ability to wound Lucifer even without it.  Why did she not get her own moment of triumph?  Why were the gods even interested in the outcome?  Was there any connection with Anubis's request that she spare the villian from the last book?  That was the last time he really interacted with her, and it still seems a random request as far as I could tell.

It seemed to me that all of Dante's running and scheming was ultimately pointless, even her working of a ""Greater Magick"".  Things started to look promising when Eve's allies came onstage in the war conference, but then all that was thrown away because of some (unexplained) new bargain of Japh's with Lucifer.  In the end, if Dante had just gone along with Japh, he would have handed Eve over to Lucifer (possibly as a ruse, possibly in earnest) and Dante would have gotten a chance to kill Lucifer.  In the end, her actions lead her only to that same chance to kill Lucifer, and losing Eve anyway (even assuming 'Eve' ever really was ""Eve"" and actually had any residual humanity in the first place).

I still really liked the first two books, about Dante Valentine, kick-butt Necromance bounty hunter, but the last three books about Dante Valentine, emotionally battered demon-pawn, really didn't connect in the same way for me.",1198713600,31,2045,4.662952646239554
7740684,4,B01ETYJ4IG,"I've been anticipating this book for months, and was not disappointed by the action and the ending. The only reason there are four stars instead of five is because like other people have mentioned, I was left with unanswered questions. I didn't want every single one answered (altho it would have been nice!) and I didn't need an in-depth explanation of every plot from day one from Japh. What I wanted were answers to questions raised in the books...such as what Danny had wanted to ask Lucas (I assume it was about why Death had refused him, since she'd been staring at his cheek) and why Japh looked so much older, with gray hair and wrinkles, upon his return from Hell. There was mention of a new bargain with Lucifer, but what was the bargain, what were the terms? It's never explained, and that drives me crazy. Since he's aged, does that mean he's mostly human now? So many questions, but still a great book, and an even better series.",1198108800,7,942,4.547058823529412
7740685,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"It is sad to say that this is the last Dante Valentine book, but it sure went out with a bang!  Dante is back in the game and is set on trying to make the Devil pay for f***ing up her life.  Japh is back at her side and Dante wants to trust him but it is still hard to do so when he goes and pulls some things behind her back.  Eve is still planning a rebellion against Lucifier and wants Dante's help as well.

Dante is caught in the middle and doens't know who to trust or who to help.  Should she help Eve who might possibly be partly her daughter who wants to kill Lucifier and take over hell herself?  Or should she help her demon lover Japh who wants to use Eve as bait and may just leave her to her own fate while trying to kill Luicifer.  Dante has a hell of time trying to make decisions in the book, for she learns of more betrayals from the people she thought she could trust.

But all will be resolved, I won't tell you how, but it gets resolved.  The epilogue is one of those annoying little ones that gives closure and yet the hope for more, but of course there will not be anymore.  I still felt a few questions nagging at my brain at the end, but I guess they were not vital enough to the story and the answer is the obvious one.

I agree with another reviewer that I felt there were a lot of unanswered questions.  Some were unimportant, but there were times when I wanted to shout at Dante, ""Ask Japh what's up with ____!  He's actually talking, maybe we'll get some answers!""  lol  However, Saintcrow did a great job keeping the pace rolling, and in the end, perhaps it's really only my personal failings that leaving me wanting more.  :-)

Often as writers progress through a series - through their world - the work they produce grows weaker.  This is not the case with the Valentine series.

7740689,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"The fifth book in the Valentine series starts out with Dante bleeding and half-dead, a big black hole in her memory. She doesn't know what happened to her or where she's been, but she knows it was awful, so awful that she's holding on to her sanity by the barest of threads. The only thing keeping her going is the growing desire to wreak some well-deserved vengeance, and kill whoever, or whatever, has left her body, mind, and soul broken.

Once back in the arms of her Fallen, Japhrimel, Dante realizes she has a good idea of who's responsibile for her current condition, none other than Lucifer himself. And when Japhrimel promises to help her, she believes that this time, just maybe, with her Fallen's help she will be able to do what she's wanted to for so long...kill the Devil.

Thrown back into the bloody, violent game between demons, Dante is determined to come out the winner this time. After meeting another Fallen demon and ridding herself of one of the Devil's little ""gifts"" and retrieving the only weapon rumored to be able to kill Lucifer, Dante's quest to kill the devil truly begins. But once again she's forced to question the true loyalty and intentions of her  Fallen. Will Japhrimel really help her kill Lucifer as he promised, or is this just another one of his lies meant to distract her while he pursues his own agenda? Plots unravel, and so do the lies, and betrayals on betrayals. Dante comes to realize that she's just a pawn in the war between demons, even Japhrimel has manipulated her for his own gain and for his own reasons, and she gets the idea that Japhrimel's been planning this way before he ever met her. As all this is revealed, Dante begins to think the only person she can trust is herself, and if she wants to still be breathing, with the Devil lying dead at her feet, she's gonna have to make a move of her own in this twisted game.

This book is filled with adventure, action, emotional angst, and everything that makes a great story. There are plots within plots and nobody is what they seem. I admire Ms. Saintcrow's ability to weave this complicated plot full of intrigue, doubt, lies, and betrayal. Japhrimel's ability to reason out complex and far-reaching plots and counterplots, blew me away. That really drove home the point of how inhuman he was, to have waited and plotted and counterplotted with inhuman patience and intelligence for decades, centuries? It certainly kept me on the edge of my seat!

My only complaint is that the story does not quite feel finished to me. I still have a bunch of questions. Is Eve really Dante's daughter? That question was never truly answered. I can only assume Ms. Saintcrow's intention was that the question in the end became irrelevant because whoever her mother was (Dante or Doreen) that it didn't matter because Eve's humanity was burned away and she was fully demon, and that demons did not care much about such things. Also, in the end things still seemed uncertain between Dante and Japhrimel (did Dante ever get over the trauma that happened to her?), but I assume also that was Ms. Saintcrow's intent. To leave it open-ended. Can either one truly ever know the other? Can a human ever really understand a demon, and can a demon ever truly understand a human? The ending did not seem clear cut to me. Not a ""happily ever after"" ending, just a real one. Not black and white, but gray with all the uncertainty that entails.

Also, the implied rumors of problems in Hell at the end, and how Dante and Japhrimel may be drawn back into the bloody and violent politics of Hell, made it seem like there is more of Dante and Japhrimel's story to be told. I sincerely hope we get to see more of them in the future!

In addition, I wanted to know more about Lucas, the Deathless, who was he and why was he cursed by Death? Maybe Ms. Saintcrow will do a short story answering this.

Each time I read one of Dante's books I am blown away by Ms. Saintcrow's ability to create a believable and realistic world and all its depth. Amazed by the complex emotions,self-doubts, flaws, humanity, and inhumanity in all her characters that makes the reader able to relate to them. I am also amazed each time by the complicated demon politics and plots within plots. Ms. Saintcrow is truly a talented and wonderful author.

 One of the great things about reading the Audie Murphy bio is that you hear his voice in your head. You see him on every page, if you have seen his movies and remember his Texas drawl.
 What struck me as remarkable was how modest Murphy was in recalling his exploits. We are talking about the most decorated man of World War 2. His humility is probably the biggest drawback in the book. The first half of the book is really a tribute to the men that he served with in the war.
 Murphy was orphaned as a child and the state broke up the remaining family. He finds a new family in the army. When you read the first chapters you see his status in the group escalate until he is basically in charge of everyone, but he never mentions how this happened. The infantry does not choose young, short, baby-faced men to lead them into battle: obviously his courage and leadership have propelled him into that role. Instead of telling us how this has happened he recalls his conversations and interactions with his friends. It is not until every single one of them is dead or wounded that he turns his attention to describing his own efforts to win the war. It is really incredible. From that point on the book is non-stop action and you cannot help but wonder how he survives. Did he have a death wish after losing his buddies?

7740704,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"This book is not about the grand strategy of war nor is it specifically about the heroic actions of its author, Audie Murphy, who was, of course, America's most decorated soldier of  World War II.  On the contrary, the book is about the war as seen up close and personal by those who actually fought it in the foxholes, on the roads and in the forests, and many times on the open battle fields of North Africa and Europe.

It is a remarkable book which puts the reader right in the middle of the action, right there with the bone-weary dog faces wallowing in the mud at the bottom of their fox holes, right there with them as they slog toward the battle lines with trucks passing them bearing the corpses of those who went before.  And, if the reader listens carefully to their gallows humor, he or she can hear them joke with one another as they try to calm their nerves and still their fears.  Then, he or she can hug the ground right beside them as they are shelled by mortars and artillery or raked by machine gun fire and watch as the soldier, whom he or she has almost come to know, is picked off by a concealed sniper or killed by a mortar blast.

In other words, this book is about war and the men who fight it.  If I had to recommend one book by means of which a reader could fully understand what it is truly like to be a combat infantryman, this would be the one.",1170288000,4,1374,4.181818181818182

After Pearl harbor at 112 pounds, he was rejected by the marines and paratroops before enlisting in the infantry. In basic training at Camp Wolters in June, 1942 he passed out in close-order drill and his cmdr tried to shove him into cook's school. At Fort Meade an officer tried to make him a clerk. He then went to Africa, Sicily, Italy, France and Germany spending over 400 days in the front lines, receiving 21 medals for capturing, wounding and killing 240 enemy.  Published in 1949 before he was a movie star, Murphy said ""The main reason I wanted the book to be written was to remind a forgetful public of a lot of boys who never made it home."" Don Graham's biography ""No Name On The Bullet"" reports that of the original 235-man roster of Company B, only 2 remained at the end, Audie and a supply sergeant. Only a few had transferred, all the rest were wounded or killed.  By 1955 Murphy was the most popular western actor in America. I have over 40 of his films on DVD and VHS. Recommended viewing: To Hell and Back, Red Badge of Courage, Night Passage (with Jimmy Stewart), The Texican, The Unforgiven (with Burt Lancaster), and No Name on the Bullet. Watching these movies is not like watching a hero or movie star, Murphy embodies all of the 18 yr old guys that never came home from Tarawa, Normandy, Viet Nam and Iraq to have a career, family and enjoy old age.

7740708,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"Audie Murphy's screen autobiography is a much better film than it has any right to be... The Army provides a Depression-era kid from East Texas with a strong family structure that he has never really experienced...

In 1937, a young Audie Murphy (played by Gordon Gebert as a boy, by Murphy himself later) is forced to become the head of a family with an ailing mother and an absent father... He drops out of grade school and goes to work full time to provide for his younger siblings until, at roughly the same time, World War II starts and his mother dies...

By enlisting in, Murphy can provide more money for his brothers, but neither the Navy nor the Marines were interested in the small guy...

In the Army, Murphy is promoted to Corporal on the troop ship carrying him overseas where he joins the 3rd Infantry Division, B Company, 15th Regiment... It soon becomes apparent that the likable 'baby face kid,' hardly old enough to shave, has a genuine aptitude for soldiering...

After North Africa, his outfit takes part in the invasions of Sicily, Anzio and Southern France... In every engagement, Murphy steps up and excels as a soldier... At the same time, he becomes friends with Brandon (Charles Drake), Johnson (Marshall Thompson), and Kerrigan (Jack Kelly). He sees himself as part of a unit, and everything that he does is meant to advance the unit, not the individual... Murphy liked to work alone, putting only himself at risk...

The one long scene that moves away from the Military--an interlude in an Italian town where he meets Maria (Susan Kohner) and her family, is embarrassingly bad... As long as the focus stays on the platoon's activities on the battlefield, the film is in fine shape... Director Jesse Hibbs makes the cold mud and rain of the Italian campaign believably real, especially a series of scenes revolving around a farmhouse and a burning tank...

One might assume that Murphy's indomitable courage would be described as Rambo--like heroics, but in comparing the film with the official combat reports, it is clear that Murphy became an astounding soldier by skill, training, intelligence, and luck... He was an equal opportunity soldier, doing everything the front line combatant is required to do in order to take and hold ground through Sicily, Italy, France, and into Germany...

All of the events recounted in the film take place before Murphy was 19 years old... In that brief military career, Audie L. Murphy becomes one of the best fighting combat soldiers of the last century... He never really seemed to care about the medals or glory, just the men of his unit and friends who fall down in the European Theater of Operations...

Murphy died tragically on May 28, 1971, when the private plane in which he was a passenger crashed into a mountain near Roanoke, Virginia... He was 46.

His last film role was earlier that year, playing Jesse James in 'A Time for Dying.'",1168732800,6,2912,4.819639278557114

Some of the scenes were extremely annoying and disappointing. For one, was when they were doing the beach landing. The only thing that got wet was their helmets...not even the inside of the boat. Instead of actually doing a landing they used war footage, which I found irritating. Another thing was in the beginning their uniforms were neatly pressed and clean even after digging a 5 foot foxhole. Thirdly, it looked like a lot of the areas where they did some scenes were obviously sets. The whole idea of it makes it look war look so happy-go-lucky. It seemed like you have 50 to 1 odds of getting shot in real war...wow, all I can say is that it was pretty terrible. The movie didn't really portray Audie Murphy as the hero he was, it just turns him into hero, he never really does anything particularly heroic and he seems to just be randomly promoted. The plot is so choppy it barely makes sense, and even if it does; it's so boring I guarantee you probably won't know or care to know what's going on...in some of the battles they win they don't even fight, they just...don't do anything.  And the action is terrible...even for the 50's..read the book instead, don't waste your time.

I remember AMC showing this movie and the host commenting that Audie Murphy went thru a lot trying to get his book on the screen. Basically, they sanitized and cleaned everything up to the point where if you were young enough, you might think war is not that bad even if you get killed. I have had a copy of the book for about 20 years and have read it about 3 times, viewing the movie once ws enough for me. It is amazing how ""all is quiet on the western front"" made much earlier when standards were even more rigid was able to pack a bigger punch, make a point and be more satisifying than this watered-down mess. Get the book, wait for the movie to come on TV.",1156377600,5,773,4.025974025974026
7740715,2,B01ETYJ4IG,"OK, Audie Murphy fans, don't bash this review.  Audie Murphy was a great man, and a true American hero.  However, this much has to be said, all of the five star reviews of this movie here reflect a continuing admiration for the man, and not for the movie itself.

As a child, I had often heard about Audie Murphy, about his status as ""the most decorated soldier in America"", and his later career as a B-movie star in Hollywood westerns.  Whenever Audie Murphy was mentioned, ""To Hell and Back"", both the book and the movie, were usually also mentioned.

And so for all these years, I knew that this movie existed, but had never seen it.  One day, I finally read the book, and then checked out the movie at the local library.  And then I read some of Audie Murphy's biographies.

What to say about this movie except that it was almost certainly the high point in the life of Audie Murphy.  Murphy was the sixth of twelve children of desperately poor Texas sharecroppers.  The father would abandon the family and the mother would die when Audie was sixteen.  World War II intervened, and Murphy's natural wholesomeness and survivalist skills as a hunter-warrior would provide him a route to become a national hero and a life as a movie star.

""To Hell and Back"" was Murphy's most successful movie.  It was made in 1955, at a time when Americans wanted only to forget the dreadfully inconclusive Korean War, preferring to relive the simpler glories of WWII.  As a war movie, it has all the typical characteristics of that era - an unquestioning respect for the military (and all authority in general), and an unspoken acceptance of the concept (totally foreign to us today) that soldiers' lives are by nature expendable in a war.  Like other war movies of the 1950's, we never see any blood, nor are there guts spraying everywhere, and definitely no mortally wounded soldiers screaming in fear and agony.  Enemy soldiers who are killed fall quickly, silently and bloodlessly to the ground, like dummies.  American soldiers who are killed also fall silently and bloodlessly to the ground, but get more screen time - we get to see their faces contort in agony as they die from their phantom wounds.  Realism having long ago been lost, the heavy equipment of war - the tanks and other weapons - are also not quite right.  The burning M10 tank destroyer that Audie Murphy jumped on becomes a more readily procurable Sherman tank.  German tanks are substituted by the then prevalent M41 Walker Bulldogs.

No, this is not ""Saving Private Ryan"".  Nor ""Platoon"".  Nor ""Apocalypse Now"".  This is not even ""The Longest Day"".  War movies are never meant to be documentaries, and thus are always limited in their depiction of real war by the social constraints of the times, and the Hollywood need to put a spin on a story that will bring in the customers.

What I find most sad about ""To Hell and Back"", having read Audie Murphy's biographies now, is that his real story was much better:  Murphy's bravery, fighting skills, and exploits were even more astounding than what was depicted in this most sanitized and unrealistic of war movies.  Achieving all of that in the context of the poverty that he grew up in was even more amazing.  Much of this was because the ever modest Audie Murphy refused to allow his life and his exploits to be glamorized.

Yes, Audie Murphy's story needs to be remade.  But such a story would find no currency in today's Hollywood - imagine that, a movie about a young white man, pulling himself out of poverty by becoming a soldier for his country, fighting for over two years continuously, and excelling at the art of war.  And then returning home as a hero, and finding even more success in life as a movie star, thanks to the help of many fellow Americans (James Cagney among them).  ""To Hell and Back"" was indeed the product of a different time.",1155340800,18,3865,4.645066273932254
7740716,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"There are hundreds of great war films out there and probably many more that will be made, but it would be hard to find one that is as well put together and more authentic than To Hell And Back, the real life story of Audie Murphy and his adventures in World War II.

This true story, based on Audie's book of the same name, tells of a young boy's hardships as he grows up to see his mother pass away and left to take care of his brothers and sisters.  At the age of 16 he tries to enlist in the service, at which several turn him down until the Army takes him on.

In any event, Murphy goes to war and becomes one of this Country's most celebrated heroes.  He becomes, by the age of 21, the most decorated soldier in World War II.

We travel with Murphy and his outfit through the many battles that they must fight and endure as many of them are killed and wounded, including Murphy himself.

Tagging along with Murphy was Jack Kelly, who later becomes one of the TV Maverick brothers, and Marshall Thompson.

The movie is very realistic in both its movie making and story telling as Murphy goes through the ropes of becoming a soldier, meeting and fighting the enemy.

It is, by far, one of those enduring movies that, along with The Sands of Iwo Jima, Wake Island, Battle Cry and A Walk In The Sun, gives us an insight into the war and its horrors and life that a soldier must go through.

This book gave a very vivid description of front line combat.  What else can I say other than I really enjoyed reading it.  I can't say it was very educational because I just would never be capable of the quick witted reactions in combat that Audie Murphy had.  I developed a genuine admiration for his talent.  He was a genius on the battle field.  He could size up his situation immediately and react accordingly.  He wasn't a great mathematician or musician but in his own area, he was at the level of Newton or Mozart.  Just a whole different kind of talent.",1143504000,9,788,4.342465753424658

7740722,4,B01ETYJ4IG,"Audie Murphy, my first autobiographical read and film by the same name, when put to the cinema never left my consciousness. One of the most factual WWII film bios uniquely played by the actual man, makes this above-average fare. If you follow-up this film with one of Audie's biographies in print, you will realize that this film is ripe for a re-do. Audie had to be tamed and quieted down throughout filming in the Pacific Northwest considerably, while dramatizing in a climate contrary to the actual events. Audie's gun prowess is only suggested throughout, except in the final standoff. By today's standards, the action sequences are interrupted by too many male-bonding yack sessions, introducing up-and-coming stars like David Janssen and Jack Kelly. Very annoying today to see the German Army fighting our forces with our M-48 tanks. If Hollywood would only re-polish this lean script with contemporary special-effects and a new boyish lead, it could again deliver an exciting war biography exceeding ""Sergeant York.""",1129075200,5,1023,5.2439024390243905
7740723,3,B01ETYJ4IG,"This fairly standard WWII pic is saved from banality by the presence of Murphy himself, who brings a first-person immediacy to the story that such films are too often missing.  The ""big picture"" is provided by an army general who does voice-overs in present-time (that is, 1955, when the film was made) because, as we are reminded repeatedly, a foot soldier doesn't often know why he's doing what he does - just that he's got to do it.  Murphy's performance is spot-on, although the dialogue is often weak, the soundtrack cheesy, and the directing crude by today's standards.  In fact the biggest flaw of this film is really that it's rather dated; few films of the era gave a better, more intimate portrait of a fighting man - but many have been made in the decades since.

There's no room for doubt that Murphy was a fine soldier and a great American, and this outing shows him to be at least a competent actor - but on balance this is not all that great a film.  Because it's based on a real person's experiences, rather than a fictional concept, there's no real story to tell here.  So once you know that Murphy joined the army and didn't get killed, you already know the whole plot.  Absent plot, not to mention character development, what we're left with is kind of a documentary, recounting the exploits of a true American hero, but with such limited historical context that it doesn't make much of an educational tool, either.  Maybe this work can best be understood as a recruiting film; we see men we've come to know shot dead (as the violin music swells) but we never see the kind of gore that causes even the deaths of enemies to haunt men's dreams for the rest of their lives.

If you really like the WWII movies made during the 1950's, this one is certainly worth seeing, even though it may not be worth owning.  On the other hand, if you've grown accustomed to films that portray the ""Hell"" of war in a more grimly realistic way, then this one may seem puerile and insipid.",1128038400,3,1988,4.497222222222222

7740725,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"""To Hell and Back,"" by Audie Murphy, is a gripping memoir of ground combat in Europe during World War II.  The back cover notes that infantryman Murphy ""was the most decorated American soldier during World War II""; among the many decorations he received was the Medal of Honor.  The 2002 Owl Books edition features a brief foreword by Tom Brokaw, who declares, ""In all of the research I've done on World War II combat veterans I cannot recall another story that involves so much up close and personal fighting.""

The book's many vivid and detailed scenes of combat are impressive.  Murphy offers lots of information about military gear and tactics: camouflage, the mechanics of a river crossing, the way a mortar shell explodes, how one calls in artillery support, etc.  It's like a textbook of combat knowledge is blended into the text, making the book a compelling resource for military professionals.  The battle scenes are not romanticized or glamorized; rather, they are presented in a matter-of-fact, disciplined style that I found powerfully effective.

Murphy details the many hardships and risks that WW2 infantry troops faced in the European campaign.  These ranged from the annoying to the deadly: fleas, water deprivation, malaria, trenchfoot, frostbite, sniper fire, landmines, separation from family, and combat-induced mental disorder.  Murphy is explicit in his portrayal of the horror of war.  He shows bodies ravaged by injuries, lives snuffed out, minds broken.  He does not spare the reader from ""the smell of singed hair and burnt flesh.""  At times the book's grim tone and harsh representation of brutality has an almost antiwar flavor reminiscent of Dalton Trumbo's unforgettable novel ""Johnny Got His Gun.""

Murphy writes with respect and affection for the troops who shared the burden of war with him.  The book is full of soldier conversations, including playful insults and humor.  Murphy includes not only accounts of these troops in combat, but also anecdotes of soldiers during interludes of rest and play.  Another interesting aspect of the book is how it shows Murphy moving up the ranks and functioning as a leader in combat.  This is a powerful book that reads more like a novel than a memoir.  It's a truly impressive example of World War II literature.",1121558400,12,2288,5.104838709677419

Audie Murphy was just a private but he became field Lieutenant by his courage and his conduct in front of the enemy. it is certainly not the most spectacular movie but it is a good movie. A good souvenir in black and white about how hard and long was the war.

7740727,4,B01ETYJ4IG,"TO HELL AND BACK is a rarity of rarities.  It tells the story of `the most decorated soldier in the history of the United States,' as Gen. Walter Bedell Smith reminds us from behind a polished desk in the film's prologue.  The true story, of course, is Audie Murphy's, the B-movie star who also happened to be one of America's greatest war heroes.

  The CinemaScope/Technicolor movie begins with 12-year-old Audie leaving school to become `the man of the family,' substituting for a missing father who, presumably, is out looking for a job.  In any event, war breaks out and the under-aged Murphy is turned down by both the Marines and the Navy, finally finding billet with the Army.

  There's something a little strained and mawkish about the pre-Army scenes, as there will be a bit later when the troops are at ease and on leave.  Murphy doesn't come off as a saint by any means, but the story is pretty sanitized and standard issue.  Still, there are some relaxed bits that cut pretty sharp.  A meal Murphy shares with an Italian family is interrupted by air raid sirens.  The family goes to shelter, Murphy waits upstairs for the all-clear to sound.  The young woman of the family comes up to speak to him and asks him ""Are you afraid?""  ""All the time,"" he replies as soon as the words are out of her mouth.  It's a nice touch in a nice scene, weighted immeasurably by knowing that it's the real hero uttering them.

  TO HELL AND BACK really shines during its combat scenes, which are uniformly well choreographed and exciting.  When Murphy and the troops fight for a farmhouse in Anzio, or later when the troops are pinned down by a string of German machine gun nests and Murphy earns one of his many medals clearing them out, the scenes are plotted out in a totally comprehensible form.

  War movie fans who might shy away after suffering through a few of Murphy's lesser efforts should give TO HELL AND BACK a chance.  Highly recommended.",1114819200,6,1949,4.598837209302325
7740728,3,B01ETYJ4IG,"TO HELL AND BACK is a true rags-to-warrior story.  The wide-screen release presents this film the way it was meant to be screened.  TO HELL AND BACK is the film version of warrior-turned-actor Audie Murphy's best selling autobiography.  Murphy, the most highly decorated combat soldier in World War Two, was originally turned down by the US Marines and Navy.  Underage, Murphy needed special permission to enlist in the Army.

Murphy soon proved his mettle in combat.  He distinguished himself in combat time and time again through campaigns in Sicily, mainland Italy, and France.  It was not until the final months of the European Campaign that a severe wound took the fearless Murphy out of the line and into a field hospital.

A discussion about the film deserves a few comments on the original best selling book.  His autobiography almost did not make it to book store shelves.  Murphy was presented with a generous advance for his autobiographical war exploits.  Unfortunately, he found it very difficult to capture his experiences on paper.  Some have since speculated that Murphy was suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome.  Who could blame him?  After recovering from his war wounds, Murphy was decorated with the Congressional Medal of Honor.  As a hero he toured the United States as part of a war bond drive.  He turned down an opportunity to attend West Point and left active duty.  Screen legend James Cagney took an interest in Audie Murphy and sponsored Murphy's theatrical training.

Murphy soon found himself in, what were then known as, B-movies.  Most of the movies were westerns.  Still, he achieved fame that was very far removed from his impoverished days in Texas.

The book, TO HELL AND BACK, was still little more than a few poorly written pages when Murphy's publisher became impatient.  With a friend's help -- and reportedly the friend ghost authored the book for Murphy -- TO HELL AND BACK was completed, published, and became a best seller.

The transition to film was a bit more difficult.  Universal studios bought the rights to the film and opted to use one of its stars, Audie Murphy, to play himself in the title role.  The Department of the Army solidly backed this production.  Fort Lewis, Washington was basically put at Universal's disposal.  Any worries that Murphy might have difficulties reenacting -- and reliving -- the heroic moments of his life were dispelled on the first days of location shooting.  Murphy handled the film as both a fine actor and veteran.

The film itself is a bit dated.  The movie's introduction and occasional narration sometimes make it seem as though it is an Army training film.  What separates this undertaking from US Army Pictorial Center films is that it is in color, wide screen, and is one of the first World War Two movies to involve large scale infantry and tank attacks.  Some of the combat scenes in TO HELL AND BACK would not be matched until the war films of the mid 1960's such as TOBRUK, THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE, and so on.  TO HELL AND BACK is strong enough to stand on its own without an introduction, animated maps, and narration.

You might even see this film as sort of a western.  Indeed, the movie soundtrack sounds as if it was meant for a cowboy film. The soldiers are generally clean cut.  With the exception of a few muddy scenes, the uniforms always appear too clean and starched to have been worn by real soldiers in continuous combat.  The grit that you will find in movies like BATTLEGROUND and ATTACK is absent from this film.  The screenplay is only disappointing in the non-tactical scenes.  Murphy's token romance with a beautiful Italian girl has no place in this movie.  The bar room brawl is also a bit cheesy.

The soldier in Murphy shows through in this movie.  He salutes sharply, handles weapons like a veteran, and barks out commands as a real soldier.  In fact, in the beginning of the movie it is difficult to believe that Murphy is a green recruit.  His handsome youthful looks served him well in TO HELL AND BACK.  Though the film followed almost ten years after Murphy charged his last machinegun nest, he is believeable as a young soldier.

The wide screen version of this film was long overdue.  The battle scenes are great. The label on the disk itself has a sort of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN design to it.  Unfortunately, the only special feature on the DVD is the movie trailer.

My recommendation:  buy the DVD, the book, and Charles Whiting's biography of Audie Murphy, HERO.",1111708800,40,4501,4.77431906614786
7740729,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"I was moved by reading the positive reviews on Amazon of this book. I read the book many years ago , and it is confused in my mind with the movie based on it. As a young person I wondered how one became a hero, and wondered whether I would ever have the kind of courage that Audie Murphy displayed time and time again in the war. Now my own Army days are long gone and I have not ever been tested, and the question of what I might have been remains academic and now irrelevant. Murphy has courage which means the ability to put oneself in danger and take those actions which remove danger from one's own people, and in the process do injury to the enemy. His boyhood training in hunting no doubt helped him develop the instincts of a soldier . The reviewers on Amazon tell how movingly Murphy writes about his fellow soldiers, and their loss in battle. After the Second World War researches about combat came to center on the idea that what mattered in motivation in war was the small unit, one's nearby fellow soldiers. The loyalty to those nearby was more important than the grand ideal. It is also said that Murphy had luck , and that goes without saying. To survive a war one must not be in the place where the grenade explodes or the bullet hits. And one can never have absolute control on that. But Murphy it is also clear also made his luck . He was a true soldier with real instincts of the right action to take. No doubt part of this was his readiness to kill. He apparently was with all the glory heaped upon him a modest person, deeply traumatized afterwards by all he had gone through. One reviewer reports that Murphy died in a small plane crash when he was only forty- six. What is important is that he was a true hero, a man who fought for his country risked himself time and time again, and played a decisive role in the combat he was involved in. Every country and maybe every war needs its heroes. Sergeant York in the first world war, and Audie Murphy ( among others)in the Second.
And here I would add one point. A nation has its freedom and Jefferson understood this only because there are Audie Murphys, those who will fight for it. The least that can be done for them is that they be recognized( as many are not) and given some kind of thanks( though they may resist this) I think now of my own dear uncle Larry Leo Zeibert of Troy, New York who was an Army Ranger and in the first landing boat in General MacArthur's invasion of the Phillipines in the battle of Leyte Gulf. My uncle fought in the jungles of New Guineau. When he came home he said to never ask him about the war, and he never talked about it. I do not want to think about the things this quiet good man saw and did . He too went through this world in a humble, backseat way and never really built anything for himself. He had a joke and a story and a way of making everyone laugh all the time. And how deeply sad and broken he was inside only God knows. May his memory like Audie Murphy's too, be for a blessing.",1105833600,8,3002,4.213541666666667

Audie Murphy was born outside of Kingston, Texas in June 1925, grew up poor, was deserted by his father, and joined the US Army at the age of 17 in 1942.  His hunting skills as a boy served him well in hunting and killing an estimated 240 German and Italian soldiers in WWII.

An amazing aspect about Audie Murphy is that he was not limited to one feat of heroism in WWII.  For almost two years, he distinguished himself as one of the greatest combat soldiers of all time with repeated acts of heroism, earning every medal our country could give including the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, 2 Silver Stars, 2 Bonze Stars, and 3 Purple Hearts.

Audie Murphy was a humble man and a born leader who would rather put himself in harms way than to risk the lives of his men if at all possible.  Even though he didn't have a good father as a role model, he was a father to the men who served with him.  If a soldier under his command was afraid to do a job, he would do it himself.

He died tragically at the age of 45 in a small plane accident in the mountains outside of Roanoke, VA in May, 1971.

7740737,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"I read this account while in high school during the '60's. The impact this story had on me was overwhelming...I literally read this book a hundred times if I read it once. I put to memory many of the passages of humor and used them regularly.
Usually when a movie is made based on a best selling novel, I tend to enjoy the film version better than the book. Don't know why, just seems to play out that way. Such was NOT the case here. Even though Murphy played himself in the film, I enjoyed the book far better. Somewhere along the line, I thought the film lost the impact that the book retained throughout.
This story is a real page-turner. Whether you're a war buff or not doesn't matter....This is a story about people...people who were just like the rest of us, who were placed in a situation of life and death...kill or be killed, and how they struggled together to perform the task of delivering the world from aggression while always yearning for home.
It's ironic, though, after reading all that Audie Murphy went through during the war, how he was wounded, yet survived the conflict, and came home to be decorated beyond measure, only to be killed in an aircraft accident some years later.

7740739,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"It was interesting to read this account of Audie Murphy's travails in World War II (Murphy was one of the most highly decorated soldiers of that war) having read Ambrose's eulogy Band of Brothers .
  Murphy  received (every major medal, some more than once, that the army has to offer). He joined the army at age 17 to support six siblings after his mother died (his father had left the family earlier), and he doesn't talk about how the war haunted the rest of his life.
  He portrays a brutal, harsh struggle to survive, where the only thing that matters is keeping oneself and one's friends alive. There are moments of great poignancy, others of humor.  Once, hungry, dirty and wet, mired in their foxholes, they notice they are under a tree with ripe cherries.  Not daring to stick a head up, let alone climb out of the foxhole, Murphy's buddy gets the idea of shooting down the branches with his machine gun, and soon they are delighted to have cherry branches falling on them, making the day just a little brighter.
  Not once does Murphy mention his numerous awards, Clearly, Murphy believed that luck played as much a part in his survival as anything he did. He was however, the kind of person who tried to control his destiny, doing what was necessary and taking the initiative in order to get through the day.  A little piece of Murphy died every time a friend was killed, and soon almost all of his friends were gone. He was delighted if they received a wound that would return them to the rear, away from battle. He sympathized and worried for the lieutenant who had been badly injured and returned voluntarily to the front only to lose his nerve under the intense shelling.  It must have been horribly traumatic to develop such close bonds and to have them ripped apart.
  At the risk of sounding a little chauvinistic, I quote from the last lines of his book:
  "" When I was a child, I was told that men were branded by war. Has the brand been put on me? Have the years of blood and ruin stripped me of all decency? Of all belief?  Not of all belief. I believe in the force of a hand grenade, the power of artillery, the accuracy of a Garand. I believe in hitting before you get hit, and that dead men do not look noble.
  ""But I also believe in men like Brandon and Novak and Swope and Kerrigan; and all the men who stood up against the enemy, taking their beatings without whimper and their triumphs without boasting. The men who went and would go again to hell and back to preserve what our country thinks right and decent.
  ""My country. America! That is it. We have been so intent on death that we have forgotten life. And now suddenly life faces us. I swear to myself that I will measure up to it. I may be branded by war, but I will not be defeated by it.
  ""Gradually it becomes clear. I will go back. I will find the kind of girl of whom I once dreamed. I will learn to look at life through uncynical eyes, to have faith, to know love. I will learn to work in peace as in war. And finally - finally, like countless others, I will learn to live again.""",1035936000,160,3074,4.328097731239093
7740740,4,B01ETYJ4IG,"Audie Murphy's To Hell and Back is one of the quintessential front-line soldier accounts of the Second World War.  The book is not a memoir or autobiography, since Murphy wrote little of it himself and describes little of his life before or after his combat experiences.  Nor does Murphy even mention any of awards, including the Medal of Honor, or the fact that he served the entire war in B Company, 1-15th Infantry, 3rd Infantry Division. The book focuses entirely on the period July 1943 to March 1945, with most of the emphasis on the Anzio, Southern France and Vosges campaigns.  On the negative side, Murphy's account is extremely self-effacing and at times is more focused on his squad members, whose GI Joe conversations appear fake and silly.  Nevertheless, Murphy's comrades appear as real human beings and the reader will regret the death of each.  To Hell and Back is not particularly well written - it is in fact a rather pedestrian account that wanders at times - but what it lacks in style it delivers in frank reality.  Murphy's wartime account is often brutal - sometimes humorous - but it makes other more recent homogenized efforts like Band of Brothers seem contrived in comparison.
 Currently, the myth has been propagated that only highly trained specialists in peak physical and mental condition should engage in close infantry combat.  Audi Murphy, the scrawny, orphaned teenager from Texas who was rejected by the marines and paratroopers, stands to discredit that myth.  In combat, Murphy found his niche in life.  With a carbine in his hands, Murphy became a real killer.  Quick reflexes, common sense and a certain amount of luck gave him the edge and allowed him to survive all his original squad mates.  A great deal has been written and speculated about Murphy's psychology and motivations; there is no doubt that he sought out combat even when he could have avoided it.  Was he a war-lover or have a death wish?  No.  Murphy fought because he was good at it.  As the main character in the French film Capitaine Conan noted, ""millions were in the war but only a few thousand actually fought it.""  Murphy was one of those soldiers who was never content just to survive the war but rather, he was strongly motivated to play an active role.  While Murphy never cracked under the strain of nearly two years of combat, there is little doubt that the war marked him indelibly. By Anzio, Murphy had become imbued with a tough, no-nonsense set of values.  At the end of To Hell and Back, Murphy writes, ""when I was a child, I was told that men were branded by war.  Has the brand been put on me?  Have the years of blood and ruin stripped me of all decency?  Of all belief?  Not of all belief.  I believe in the force of a hand grenade, the power of artillery, the accuracy of a Garand.  I believe in hitting before you get hit, and that dead men do not look noble.""
 Unfortunately, the weakest aspect of To Hell and Back is the author's failure to paint a complete portrait of himself.  Important issues, like how did a combat-wise Sergeant Murphy deal with his inexperienced lieutenants in Anzio or France are virtually ignored.  The fact that Murphy rose from squad leader, to platoon sergeant, to platoon leader to company commander in the same company is never addressed, but would have been very interesting.  How did Murphy handle the transition from enlisted, to NCO to commissioned officer surrounded by his peers?  To Hell and Back is enhanced by the fact that it was written only shortly after the war when memories were still sharp, but the rush to publish a ""blood and guts"" account undermines the value of Murphy's story.  The brief introduction by Tom Brokaw also appears a blatant attempt to market a dead hero, as if his name was brand-name merchandise.  Brokaw says nothing of value in this introduction, and it should have been written by somebody who actually knew the man, rather than some publicity-hog talking head from NBC who never met him or served in the military.
 Hopefully, the reprint of To Hell and Back will help to keep alive the notion that America can produce fine soldiers from places other than West Point.  Murphy's book should also be compared with other war memoirs from other authors and other wars.  Recently, I read the Persian Gulf War memoir entitled The Eyes of Orion, and was struck by the authors' near-obsession with post-war graduate school plans while remaining virtually oblivious to their potential for battlefield death.  Murphy said, ""until the last shot is fired, I will go on living from day to day, making no postwar plans.""  Compared with the pretentious, homogenized, backbiting Band of Brothers, Murphy's book seems incredibly modest and civil.  Although Murphy's unit suffered heavy casualties and was often short of food in the front-line, the author never complained about his superiors or the US Army.  Murphy's unselfish and uncritical reflection of his wartime service should stand as an example of others who serve and write.",1021161600,79,5018,4.804195804195804

Nowhere in this book does Audie Murphy mention that he was ever decorated, the deeds speak for themselves. Because of several bios of Audie Murphy it is known that while Audie wrote, or told to a writer, the combat stories in this book are is own, Audie's ghost writer connected his first hand accounts with pages of banter from Audie's fictionalized platoon buddies.

7740742,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"This book is a classic of infantry warfare. It should be noted that Murphy wrote less than 10 percent of the book himself. In fact, the bulk of the book was written buy a fellow veteran and Hollywood screenwriter (and full-time alcoholic) David ""Spec"" McClure. Their collaborative process in writing the book is interesting. McClure would use Murphy's medal citations and Donald Taggart's classic ""History of the Third Infantry Division in World War II,"" for solid reference, then he would interview Murphy, that is, provided if he was so inclined to speak. If the session was fruitful, much was done. If it wasn't, it went slow. Murphy would then read over what was done and either he would approve it or send it back. Sometimes, McClure would get so annoyed when Audie would send a passage back he'd yell at Murphy, ""Well what DID happen?"" then Murphy would tell him. It took them a year, but they finally completed it. The result was a bestseller and a future movie adaptation.
One thing about this book for a more contemporary reader: this book is packed with a lot of dialogue much of which borders on the hokey. Still, that doesn't lessen the impact of Murphy's story. Also he never mentions his medals. His tone at times screams of modesty. Sometimes, you don't even know he's there, he lets his friends and comrades-in-arms do most of the talking (in here, their names are fictionalized). The book's dedication to two of his buddies who were killed in action should come off as no surprise.

7740743,4,B01ETYJ4IG,"This is one film that is ripe for a remake. But one thing should be kept in mind; even if you got Spielberg to direct it, Tom Hanks to produce it, and the most authentic WWII gear to make it look real, it would be missing the one thing the original movie has: Audie Murphy himself.
This cinematic treatment of his ghostwritten World War II memoir of the same name differs in many ways from the book. Novak is killed when Murphy was in the hospital according to the book, but in the movie, he dies before Murphy's eyes. Audie is seen at the film's beginning taking care of the family; in truth, he was in orphanages. But again, the movie has Murphy.
And for me, that's enough. Not too many heroes get to portray themselves on the screen. And Audie had enough acting ability to play himself on the screen (something Mickey Mantle or Jackie Robinson couldn't really do with all due respect).
Still, it's a fun movie and it does give viewers Murphy's war experiences in a nice digestible hour and a half. Heck, even if half of what is portrayed on the screen was true, Murphy's war experiences would eclipse 99% of all the others (the guys of E Company in Band of Brothers are included here too).
It's a good intro to Murphy's war career if somehow his book is too daunting or if one doesn't have the time.",1014681600,6,1302,4.362139917695473
7740744,4,B01ETYJ4IG,"Murphy doesn't glorify war or his own accomplishments ( he doesn't even mention his awards) He paints a stark landscape and a  brutal existence but still manages to draw the reader in with vivid descriptions of the only thing that matters to him at the time, his companions. Sometimes it's hilarious how they kid and pick on each other but then we're thrown back to reality when one of them loses his composure or is killed. The soldiers don't care about the next hill , they want to stay alive and keep their buddies alive. You feel a piece of Murphy die with each of his friends that are wounded or killed.
The best is left for the last lines where he becomes a philosopher; this should be read every Rememberance day.
""  When I was a child, I was told that men were branded by war.  Has the brand been put on me?  Have the years of blood and ruin stripped me of all decency? Of all belief?
  Not of all belief. I believe in the force of a hand grenade, the power of artillery, the accurancy of a Garand.  I believe in hitting before you get hit, and that dead men do not look noble.
  But I also believe in men like Brandon and Novak and Swope and Kerrigan; and all the men who stood up  against the enemy, taking their beatings without whimper and their triumphs without boasting.  The men who went and would go again to hell and back to preserve what our country thinks right and decent.
  My country. America! That is it. We have been so intent on death that we have forgotten life.  And now suddenly life faces us. I swear to myself that I will measure up to it.  I may be branded by war, but I will not be defeated by it.
  Gradually it becomes clear. I will go back. I will find the kind of girl of whom I once dreamed.  I will learn to look at life through uncynical eyes, to have faith, to know love. I will learn to work  in peace as in war.  And finally - finally, like countless others, I will learn to live again.
He doesn't know, even years after the war is over, if he has learned to live again.
A truly compelling story that speaks to anyone about what it means  to persever in the face of hardship.
What it doesn't tell you in the story is that he joined the army at 17 to support his 6 younger siblings after his father left and his mother died. It doesn't tell you that he won ever major medal the the USA  gives it's solders , some of them more than once. It doesn't tell you how he was haunted by post traumatic stress syndrom for the rest of his life but still managed to have a successful song writing and acting career including starring as himself in the movie about his war experiences ""To Hell and Back"" that was the highest grossing movie until ""Jaws"" came out in 1975.
OK , I'm obviously biased abut this story, but the only thing I can find wrong with this story is that it was too short. I still find myself rereading sections that I found particularily compelling.",997488000,10,2898,4.2025316455696204

I LIKE IT NOT BECAUSE I WAS BORN IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. BUT IT SHOW WHAT PEOPLE CAN DO IN ANY GIVING SITUATION........................................",976924800,12,310,4.7592592592592595
7740746,4,B01ETYJ4IG,"The single biggest reason to watch this movie is that the star himself was in fact the single most decorated war hero of World War Two, and he is convincing here playing himself with dignity, sincerity, and humility,  which, of course, Audie Murphy always had in spades. The movie was adopted  from his best-selling autobiography, which my Mom let me read after  blackening out all of the four letter slang (as she called it). Perhaps it  shows that he was my childhood hero, and I still have a personalized  autographed photo somewhere reading ""Thanks, Barry, for being my  fan"" that a friend's mom got for three or four of us ten year olds at  the time this movie was released in the mid 1950s. It was the first movie I  saw ten times. And I wasn't alone; Murphy was a national icon.
The  movie truly is a classic; tightly directed, poignant, honest, accurate, and  showing gripping combat without being gory or maudlin. It sometimes decends  into travelogue movie-theater type newsreel moments, but these are  thankfully rare and forgiveable. On the other hand, this is an interesting  and absolutely true story of a common and uneducated boy from rural Texas  who wanted more than anything to be a soldier and serve his country, and  his subsequent deeds and patriotism above and beyond the call of duty  inspired a whole generation of us who wanted to imitate his call to  country. Unfortunately we walked into another time and the miasma of  Vietnam. But that's another story for another time. Escape back to a time  when the moral choices were clearer, and a real live hero was available to  act his way memorably through an accurate recounting of his extraordinary  if abbreviated military career. He may be gone too soon, the victim of a  plane crash in the early 1970s, but his lifetime admirers remain. Enjoy!",964224000,164,1820,4.747603833865814
7740747,5,B01ETYJ4IG,"I read this book for the first time as a Sophomore in high school and am compelled to rank it as one of the top five books  I've ever picked up (Sakai's ""Samurai!"" and Galland's ""The First and the  Last"" being the only others that I'd dare compare to it).
  Audie  Murphy, the most decorated American soldier of World War II, was awarded  every medal for valor his country could give (The Congressional Medal of  Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, The Bronze Star Medal, The Bronze Star  Medal with a Bronze Service Arrowhead, the Legion of Merit, two Silver  Stars, the Purple Heart...the list goes on and on), yet he tells his story  in such an unassuming manner that it is hard  to believe it is written by a  war hero.  Audie seems more content to discuss his friends and their  impact on the war and on his life than to talk about himself.  In his  eyes, they are the heroes, and his book does a fine job of paying homage to  the footsoldier of World War II.
  His book is also a marvelously frank  and vivid account of combat through the eyes an ""everyman.""  A  poor farm boy from Texas, Murphy is perhaps in many ways the typical hero:  one who, when faced with a challenge, rises to a level beyond that which  could reasonably be expected under different circumstances.  Despite being  rejected by the Marines and the Navy for military service (""You're too  small, kid""), Audie refused to give up his quest to serve his country.  Faced with the horror of war (and the deaths of close comrades), Murphy  continuously and relentlessly rose to meet the challenges presented him  when those of lesser mettle would surely have cowered.  All the more  remarkable is that Audie accomplished all this before the age of twenty!
  No review could ever do this book justice.  It is wonderful, sincere,  sad, and true.  Rest assured, you will not be disappointed.  HIGHLY  recommended.",946684800,55,1882,4.621951219512195
7740748,4,B01ETYJ4IG,"This is one of my favorite war films for several reasons.  One is that it is always fascinating to see how a book is translated into film, and in this case, Murphy's story is told very well.  And I can't remember many  other films where the author plays himself!  Though not the best war film  ever made, it does tell the story the way Murphy wanted it told, through  the eyes of the everyday soldier.
What makes the film stand out to me is  that Murhpy gives a more gutsy performance than most people can realize.  It was learned many years later that he suffered from recurring nightmares  about the horrors he saw in war, and one can only imagine what it was like  to have to recreate so many painful memories, especially the scene where  his best friend(played by Charles Drake) dies in his arms.  Though the  character had a different name, the scene is almost exactly the way it  happened.
Perhaps what I take from this is how war can so drastically  change a person.  Murhphy entered the war as an underage oprphan who  initially was thought unfit for combat, and went on to become our most  decorated combat soldier.  While it does get a little cliched at times,  this movie is enjoyable because it allows us to see the real hero is the  common foot soldier, without whom the war could not have been won.",943315200,66,1312,4.428571428571429

Last summer I took a trip to Germany/France and stood on the very ground where Audie Murphy held off a very seasoned and determined German Battalion, singlehandedly.  The location and manner in which the French had honored the 3rd ID's stand against some of Hitler's best combat units was very touching - in our tour group not a dry eye among 40+ attendees.  I had not seen the movie and just had to get it -- so glad I did.  Audie Murphy represents the best of American and America's Warriors -- awesome movie!",1533600000,,541,4.489795918367347
