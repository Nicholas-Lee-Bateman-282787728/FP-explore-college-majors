6256947,4,B00ICR6SBI,Oh yes- I really like all of the Arrested Development- It just took me a long time to find them.

6256948,3,B00ICR6SBI,"I was so excited when I found out Netflix picked this up for another season, but this season 4 just doesn't feel like the same show. It still has some of the original humor in it, I just didn't like the direction they took with the show and the characters.

6256950,4,B00ICR6SBI,"Note: This is only a content review. Since Season 4 has not yet been released on dvd, I cannot rate this product, only the content of the show.
Arrested Development: Season 4 struck me as disappointing within the first six episodes. I thought it had forgotten what made it so downright brilliant within the first three seasons. My judgements were ill-conceived. The only reason I rate this at four stars is because it doesn't quite reach the insurmountable heights set by the previous season 3, but season 4 is every bit as clever, exciting, subtle, and hilarious as it has ever been, not merely playing to the nostalgia for long time fans but creating an entirely new atmosphere, lit up by our favorite selfish, spoiled rotten dysfunctional family. The Bluths are back and as despicable as ever.",1398643200,12,796,4.817518248175182
6256951,5,B00ICR6SBI,"After years of promises, the seemingly impossible happened: a fourth season of Arrested Development was released.  Easily one of the best and most critically acclaimed TV comedies, AD is the story of the Bluths, a severely disfunctional family who've managed to achieve fame and fortune through illegal and inmoral ways, and its one member who wants to fix things the right way but spectacularly fails.

If you're interested in this season, you know very well the story of the Bluths, so I won't waste any more time on it.  I'm going to speak about the fourth season.

The first thing you'll be pleased to know is that the entire cast is back.  No one has been replaced, which is quite important.  This is actually a big accomplishment, since most of the actors have been busy doing other things, so getting them together was a hard task.  That meant jumping through several hoops, and unfortunately, I have to say, sometimes it shows.  But more on that later.

The most obvious thing about this particular season is the curious way it's shown.  All episodes aren't set in an advancing timeline, but in the same one, with each episode shown from different perspectives.  For instance, in the first episode, told in the perspective of Michael, you'll see him visiting George-Michael's dormitory and finding Maeby there in a scene.  Later, in another episode told from Maeby's perspective you'll know why she's there and you'll see Michael visiting.

It's a strange way to set things, but it generally means that the more you watch the more you'll understand, the more jokes you'll get and the more invested you'll be.  On the other side of the coin, it means you need to have a little patience with the show.  Things will be confusing at first, but you need to stay with the show until you figure out how all the pieces are slowly fitting.  It's a trade-off.  People might be a little turned off at first, due to the non-linear nature of the storyline.  The previous seasons were steady in their development (no pun intended), but this one starts slow at first and slowly gains traction until halfway, in which it speeds up.  You need to stay with the show, watching only the first few episodes won't be enough to form your opinion.  You also can't start wathing in the middle and then watch the first episodes for the first time, because the show is structured to slowly reveal things that were mentioned before.

This, of course, means that the season severely benefits from repeated viewings.  Once you know what's going on, visiting older episodes will show them in a new light, and you'll get a kick of finding clues to later-revealed plot points.  This was already true in previous seasons, but it's far more intensive here.

Timeline aside, the show still retains the same brand of humor the previous seasons showed.  Still filled to the brim with running jokes, both old and new, and all characters are the same, unable to grow as persons, but wonderfully growing as characters.  This is specially noticeably with Michael, who liked to see himself as the straight man in previous seasons, despite the fact that he was as much of a Bluth as the rest of his family.  Things get more evident here, as he slowly realizes he's as much of a jerk as the rest.  There are also a few in-jokes that might be hard to get.  For instance, every flashback to previous seasons now carries a watermark.  Some people complained about this, believing the makers of the show wouldn't fork out money for the real software to strip the watermark away, not realizing it was done on purpose.

The plot involves Michael losing money in a spectacular way and being forced to do unspeakable things to get it back, GOB finding a friend for the first time and confusing it with love (since he's never experienced friendship before), Lindsay trying to get back to her ""ideals"" of saving the planet, Tobias dealing with the aftermath of an old Fantastic Four movie (curiously based on a real story), and Oscar being constantly fooled by his brother.  It's like all other seasons.  Seemingly unrelated things end up joining together to further complicate the Bluths' lives.

Now, I have to say, there are a few bad or strange parts, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention them.  I already talked about the slow start, so I won't dwell much on it, but this effectively means that the show might not seem that funny at first.  The first episodes don't seem to contain many funny moments, but that's because those moments only become funny once you've seen later episodes.  Again, please stay with the show.  Another weird thing is Portia de Rossi's looks.  This will throw people off at first, because she looks different.  As in, you might even think her character was recast.  This is sadly the product of plastic surgery in real life.  You might believe at first it's some joke about her character in the show and it's all make-up, but it isn't.  Other strange thing is that Ron Howard, the movie director, has a role in this series as himself.  This isn't a bad thing by itself, but since he's also the series narrator it can get confusing, since he makes no effort to mask his voice on either role.

Also, as I mentioned before, reuniting the actors for filming was no easy task, and in some cases it was not possible.  This means that in some scenes you'll notice quite clearly that the actors are not there at the same time.  This is specially noticeable in a few scenes in which a very obvious green screen effect is used, which takes you away a little.

But the one really bad thing about this season is the newly introduced character of Debrie.  She's a washed-up drug-addict ex-actress, who manages to capture the attention of Tobias, who completely misses all the signs and treats her as a regular person.  The real problem is that, well... she's just not funny.  She's sad.  I mean, the show pretends us to laugh at her desperately eating butter from a cup, frantically losing her faith as an actress and ending up passed out in the trash, but those moments are too realistic to be funny.  There's no exaggeration for the purposes of comedy, there's no actual jokes, the series simply shows the real consequences of a bad drug habit, and it just kills the humor of every scene she's in.  Fortunately, she's only around for a few episodes, but I really hope she doesn't come back for next season (or the movie).

Those things aside, this is still a great series.  It takes a while to get this season, but it's worth the wait.  If you loved the first three seasons, you'll love this one.  If you didn't love the first three seasons, where's your heart?  WHERE'S YOUR HEARTH, MONSTER?!?",1393113600,59,6669,4.6552609067579125

6256957,1,B00ICR6SBI,"This is an absolute travesty. Everything that made Arrested Development a strong series is gone, and is replaced by weak writing, contrived situations, lame characters, a ridiculous plot, and very weak editing. This last one is probably the biggest disappointment--the editing of the original three seasons was truly inspired, but here it's quite lame and very weak. It's evident from episode one that this is not the AR development of old.  The horribly contrived situation of Michael living in his son's dorm and being so completely stupid that he can't see that his son isn't okay with it makes me cringe as a viewer. And when he gets in a public shower with his son when there's a free one right next to it, well, that's just creepy in many, many ways. And the creepy things continue all through the season. We felt dismayed after the first two episodes, but we decided to watch the whole season just to see if things get better.  They don't--they actually get worse. This is a complete waste of time and effort and energy and money, and it all leads to one of the most stupid endings that I've ever seen to anything. I think the five-star reviews are from people who were so happy that the show was back that they didn't care about quality, but this is like a long-lost friend coming back into your life, only now he's into drugs and he smells bad and he constantly insults you and calls you names--he's not the same friend you used to have.",1492646400,2,1446,4.5576923076923075

Though it doesn't quite have the impeccable writing of Seasons 1 & 2 (season doesn't either for the most part), Season 4 was still a treat that delivered many of the goods that the series is known for: multiple layers of jokes for each line of dialogue, clever self-referencing call-backs, and frustratingly yet endearing characters. And though it doesn't quite deliver the quality of the earlier seasons, it did help to shape the new paradigm of ""TV"" production, made with the awareness that all of it can be watched in marathon sessions.

6256982,5,B00ICR6SBI,"Superb season of Arrested Development, both funny and painful.
Season 4 is noticeably slower in pace than the previous three seasons. It delves deeper into each character's story really giving the actors a chance to flex and the scenes a chance to breathe realistically.
The acting is as funny and compelling as ever.
The writing is sharp, complex, and hilariously convoluted. The context in many of the scenes change as the season progresses allowing for a continually evolving and enriching effect.
The pacing is a work of wonder. The music is jazzy in quirky scenes, watered-down in stranger scenes, and even speeds up and slows down in accordance with how quickly the characters are moving and walking; unnoticeable to most I'm sure but subconsciously the effects are very rewarding.
While I like the first three seasons and its iconic, outlandish, and even taboo humor, Season 4 brings something far more intimate and real to the table and for that I'm glad.",1470787200,,963,4.987577639751553

To me, for the first time the series felt like it was working a bit too hard for its weird and wacky outrageousness, and it's brilliant self-knowing 'meta' quality now feels a bit pat.

I think it may have been a major mistake to center each episode around 1 character.  These characters are wonderful, but too one note to stay with any single one for too long.  What worked so brilliantly in the original was the balance between this gallery of loonies, and thats diminished in this new format.  Also, while the actors are as terrific as ever, the character of Michael is now more of an out-and-out jerk, and George Michael is getting there, instead of being ""nice guys with an edge"".  So there's a bit less of that human presence at the center of the show to keep the empathy up.

Not that is bad, but you can tell that they couldn't get everyone together for every single episode so the next best thing was to make it based around each character and pool it together. Its not a horrible idea but if you only watch 1 episode here and there you might crack a smile but it wouldn't be anything special. When you watch it as a whole you pick up on the references and laugh out loud. Watching this was kind of like being part of an inside joke and not understanding it until you were filled in later on.

The first 3 seasons I would give a 5 stars. This one was more like a 3.5 but I hope they continue on with this show!",1436400000,,758,4.0198675496688745

6257032,5,B00ICR6SBI,"I originally hated this show when it first aired. And I mean HATED it. Aside from the Afternoon Delight joke in the Christmas episode, I hated everything about this show. Aside for the cast (Who even I had to admit was a great ensemble), I found the show to be too juvenile. It was years later when the show was in re-runs on HDNET, did I start enjoying it. I still found this show to be juvenile, but I just went with it. And if you just go with it and accept the show at face value, it's a goofy show. So when i heard there will be a season 4 7 years after the cancellation of the show, I was optimistically hesitant. When it finally premiered on Netflix, I watched it. And I actually liked it on the first viewing. The first three episodes are slow, but it needed to be so they can re-introduce the characters and explain where they are 10 years later. The format of the show is different than the original series and that's a good thing. Instead of a season arch, the entire season is told thru the eyes of one character in every episode. It's almost like a murder mystery that you find out slowly and thru flashbacks. And you get to see the same thing thru the eyes of different characters. Each episode is inter-linking and it's just great. I think the reason why some fans hate Season 4 is that it didn't live up to their expectations. After all, they had 7 years to think about what a Season 4 would be like. Which isn't a bad thing. But I went into the season with no expectations except seeing what the characters were like and I wasn't disappointed. I heard that Mitchell Hurwitz is re-editing Season 4 and I think that's a bad thing. Because the season is perfect as it is.",1431993600,,1685,4.252336448598131

6257048,4,B00ICR6SBI,"""Arrested"" fans know what a fantastic, beyond ""great"", show this is. It really is one of the top 10 comedies ever produced for television. Though it was canceled early, we were lucky to have the 3 seasons we did while it aired on Fox. This fourth season may not be as good as the best episodes of the previous 3 seasons, but it is a rewarding experience for any Arrested fans as the entire season is like one huge puzzle box of an episode.

My only complaint here is the lack of blu-ray release. Sure, the previous seasons were released in DVD and very few shows originally released in DVD have been released in blu-ray, but since this season has come out in the era of blu-ray, why no blu-ray release? Hmmmm...I think Fox Home Entertainment has ""made a huge mistake""!",1424390400,3,768,4.446808510638298

6257050,1,B00ICR6SBI,Wow I was really disappointed in season four. First of all what was this thing about not tipping a black person I thought that was way out of character considering they don't have black people in the show so why would you humiliate black people as working-class people and you didn't even tip them I Wiliwili had enjoyed season 12 and three but I've given up on season four it was a let down and kind of races with that black thing,1423612800,2,431,4.2682926829268295

Those recurring jokes that make the entire series so funny resurface here and become magnified.  After you watch season 4 once, you'll want to revisit it again and again to catch all the subtleties.  The special features in this set are a nice treat for fans, as well.  The interviews are funny but not particularly illuminating.  A must for lovers of the series.",1423440000,,585,4.523809523809524

6257056,1,B00ICR6SBI,"I just had to give this season a one star, because I HATED it.  It sucks, its crap, its just. Plain. BORING!

The original series was amazing. It was brilliantly funny, smart, densely scripted and PHENOMENALLY edited. But more importantly, it was ENTERTAINING! So, you could re-watch it over and over again and catch new things that you missed before because you were probably laughing so hard!  That was the amazing thing about the first three seasons.

This season just drops the ball.  Many reviews say that you have to finish the season and all the pieces make sense, then it becomes funny; but every episode Ive seen has been a chore to watch, so why would I waste my time with it again. Did the writers forget that the heart of a comedy show should be it being FUNNY?

Anyways, I am committed to finishing this season because I was such a fan of the original show, but I find it hard to believe that I will every want to re-watch it or even care too much for the rumored fifth season or movie.

I don't mind the new, single character structure.  It could have been good if they just made the show more interesting. It is just too boring to pay enough attention and follow anything.

In the end, season 4 is an artistic embarrassment compared to what the show used to be. They should have just left it alone, We had three amazing seasons, and the show wrapped up pretty nicely. If they are not going to do it right, have some artistic integrity and don't deliver a wholly sub-standard project.

In short, this season was a real swift kick to the Charlie browns.",1421020800,13,1566,4.425087108013937

6257065,4,B00ICR6SBI,"The original series on Fox ranks as one of the best sitcoms ever.  It just unfortunately did not get the kind of ratings that kept it on the air.  This series tried to recapture the magic of the original run, and while it could at times, it did not really consistently sustain it.  I do not think there was an episode in the original three seasons where I was not gut laughing through most of it.  I did not get that feeling with season 4.  And while I did like it better upon second viewing, I still cannot say I like it as well as the first three seasons.

The story picks up right after the events of the final episode, then tries to fill in the intervening year + time period.  But instead of telling it in chronological order, each episode tells the story from a different character's perspective.  So a joke would be set up in one episode and finished in another.  Or you would see the same scene from different angles.  Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it just took to long to get to the punchline or payoff.  I personally think they would have been better off just time jumping the full 8 years that the series had been off the air and telling the story of what happened to this crazy group of people.

As far as the discs go for those who get them, you only have the option of getting it on DVD.  The 15 episodes are spread over 3 discs, then all the bonus material is included on disc three.  Those consists of features on the story of arrested development, reassembling the cast, how the season was made, and then some of the actors discussing their characters.  It amounts to just about an hour's worth of bonus material.

All in all, the series is good, at some points very good, but falls short of the greatness it had when it was on TV originally.  But in my opinion even a ""not as good""  Arrested Development is better than a lot of what is out there.  I cannot say that everyone will like it.  You first have to like the kind of humor where almost nothing is off limits to make fun of.  Secondly, if you are a die hard fan of the series, and will accept nothing less than what you got during the FOX run, then this is probably not for you.  But if you are willing to accept the differences I do think it is still worth checking out.",1418860800,9,2251,4.210280373831775

It is different than the original 3, but they pretty much made that clear from the beginning.
