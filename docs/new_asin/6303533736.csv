7849239,5,6303533736,This is and was a great part of Black History Month. It has been years since it was aired regularly on PBS. It took me a week to tape it and I have threatened my entire family with death if anything happens to my only VHS copy.  Icheck every so often to see if it has finally made it to DVD. Until then I will continue to watch the copy I have and wait and see if it will return to the air-ways.,1232582400,2,395,3.7590361445783134
