8162056,1,B000KEG8SO,"This is a bad rape/abduction film that takes place in a body shop. Lisa ""I have legs and cleavage"" Stewart (Shannon Michaels) needs her car repaired after an accident. She keeps a ""journal"" which is a composition notebook. She returns at night, overly dressed to pick up her car and becomes a tool for the crew.

The film starts out claiming this is a true story that happened in 1994 Riverdale, Ga. There is a most irritating uncredited narrator who pointlessly describes what is in the journal. She takes long pauses while she puffs on a cigarette. The acting was bad and you wanted to see everyone die. The sound quality was poor. One of the mechanics, (Rob Rose) starts out with a Jersey accent and then switches to a southern accent. The script was rather Spartan. No character build-up.

Great title. Nice cover. Slightly inaccurate as Lisa wore a black bra and not white.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, no nudity, rape. girl/girl scenes.",1346457600,6,938,4.742331288343558
