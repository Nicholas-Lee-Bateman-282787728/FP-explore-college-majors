6683024,5,B00NWIFYQC,Great series and tremendous acting.  We bought season two and three after watching season 1.,1423267200,,92,5.133333333333334
6683025,5,B00NWIFYQC,Love it.,1423180800,,8,3.5
6683026,5,B00NWIFYQC,"This series about an elite national Danish police unit which is summoned to assist local police in tackling a variety of serious crimes such as arson, serial killers or murders when they lack manpower, resources or the local police want more expertise and objectivity is apparently based on real cases.  Another big plus for me was finding out about sentencing at the end of each episode.  I found the acting first rate.  This cohesive team is driven to solve crimes which often impacts badly on their personal lives and we see them make mistakes in judgment and live with the consequences of poor decisions as well as personal disappointments and stressors.",1422230400,7,658,4.90990990990991
6683027,5,B00NWIFYQC,"This Danish police drama reminded me a bit of the US show ""The Closer"" with Kyra Sedgwick. Like that show it has a strong female lead character ""Ingrid"" who is the right balance of strength, smarts, & sexiness. She has a team of cops around her who are all flawed, admirable, & complicated just like she is (the most familiar face being Mads Mikkelsen who starred in Casino Royal). I've become a big fan of Nordic crime shows in recent years (The Bridge, The Killing), and this show ranks right up there which is pretty remarkable considering the first season takes place in 1999. Americans will like the 'format' of this show because while the cops characters/backstories develop over the course of the whole first season, each episode features a homicide case that gets 'wrapped up' in 45 min. I highly recommend this show as a good first entry into checking out 'Nordic Noir'",1420848000,20,878,4.707792207792208

6683039,5,B00NWIFYQC,The Swedish/Danish crime series are really good and don't miss anything in the translation.  They are grittier than American crime shows but a bit more realistic.  I only ordered one season to be sure I would like it and subsequently ordered the other two.,1464220800,,256,4.795454545454546
6683040,5,B00NWIFYQC,I've enjoyed very much,1462492800,,22,4.75

6683042,5,B00NWIFYQC,"I needed a new crime series to watch while on the stationary bicycle, so I bought all the available seasons of Unit One. It's a terrific crime series, with a blend of interesting police work and personal stories that comes across much more realistic than most American productions. And for an older show, I think it holds up really well.",1460246400,,337,4.633333333333334

6683057,4,B00NWIFYQC,"01/09/16 - Very good show, although I didn't like episode 10 where the police condoned international kidnapping of a 9 yo boy. IP needs to get rid of that wife of his.  I liked this as much as the Swedish Wallander, which is one of my favorite police dramas of all time.  It's The Closer with smarter plots but the same amount of humor.  Very worth the money.",1452297600,,359,4.25

6683060,5,B00NWIFYQC,"I have watched part of this series before on a PBS channel, but the channel decided to cancel it, so when I found out Amazon had it in stock, I decided to order it!! It is an excellent series taking place in Denmark, and is really suspenseful and violent at times since it is a crime series.  I really enjoy it since I am Danish by birth, so I can follow what they are saying!  It is subtitled as well.  I highly recommend if you like crime shows!! I will be ordering seasons 2 & 3 as well.",1449014400,,490,3.979591836734694

6683063,5,B00NWIFYQC,Great show!!!,1447200000,,13,6.0
6683064,5,B00NWIFYQC,So far this is a great show...I really like watching European police/crime dramas and I don't mind the English subtitles...they are easy to follow. The European actors have so much more depth and give the characters they play realistic qualities...more like real life. American shows focus too much on the glitz and glamour of the actors making it not realistic at all...police officers do not ride around dressed up in party clothes and drive brand new sports cars. I'm looking forward to watching the other series.,1447027200,3,516,5.011627906976744
6683065,5,B00NWIFYQC,"Like the characters, direction, and the show in general is written so the sense of urgency is apparent without the unnecessary ""drama"" that most American shows incorporate into their series.",1446595200,,190,5.366666666666666
6683066,5,B00NWIFYQC,"Enjoyed. A good way to practice danish and experience the danish landscape, suburbs, cities and villages.  Fun to watch some of the same actors who were in Borgen and The Killing when they were first starting out.",1446249600,,213,4.756756756756757
6683067,4,B00NWIFYQC,Awesome. Much better than the crap US crime dramas.,1445472000,,51,4.777777777777778
6683068,5,B00NWIFYQC,excellent scan crime series,1444176000,,27,6.0
6683069,4,B00NWIFYQC,"Unit One tells the stories of a Danish special police unit investigating serious crimes that are beyond the capabilities of local police. the young mads Mickelson plays a secondary continuing role in the series period

The show is very well acted and provides a strong, dramatic, police procedural in an environment that is probably unfamiliar to most American viewers period. Denmark it is one of the most successful European countries. it's standard of living is very high, and it's tolerance for crime quite low. The show effectively portrays the enormous pressure placed upon police to meet the expectations of a political system and public intolerant of police failures. Well worth watching.",1443830400,,696,5.27027027027027
6683070,4,B00NWIFYQC,Good crime drama.  I like all the characters in this because they deal with real life issues.  Fischer and La Cour are my favorites.  They have a good balance between them.  La Cour is the sensible one and Fischer is the bad boy of the team.  (extra bonus that Mads Mikkelsen is Fischer)  He of course is super sexy as usual!,1443657600,,325,4.245901639344262
6683071,5,B00NWIFYQC,Every episode is interesting,1442361600,,28,6.25
6683072,3,B00NWIFYQC,"I purchased this series based on the review that compared this to THE CLOSER. While there may be a few similarities, this show was void of humor, bright lighting, or the fast pacing that is typical of TNT's hit crime drama. That certainly does not mean this show is without merits; the acting, camera work and story lines are decent. It is just that it doesn't really hook me in the way the THE CLOSER does. I wouldn't have bought it had I known.",1442102400,,446,4.321428571428571
6683073,5,B00NWIFYQC,Wonderful  acting and  great story lines!  I fell in love with the entire team.,1442016000,,79,4.5

6683075,3,B00NWIFYQC,"This was ok but not close to a show like Spiral or some of the Scandinavian shows.  I never saw any real great detective work.  Some of the acting seemed weak.  This might appeal to people who are not into a lot of sex or nudity in their shows.  I will watch Mads Mikkelson in anything.  All reviews of tv, movies, music and the like just friend on personal preferences.",1441411200,,370,4.228571428571429
6683076,5,B00NWIFYQC,Engrossing police procedural - the Danish way - Interesting to contrast American and British similar efforts. Police investigators seem less volatile and more reserved and each team member has a particular strength or talent.  Interesting to see various towns in Denmark as team travel to sites of homicide throughout the country. Denmark is surprisingly rural with cities more like towns.,1441238400,,389,5.483333333333333
6683077,1,B00NWIFYQC,"Boring--we watched one and a half hours of the first episode, and it was slow as molasses. They had to spice it up with a totally unnecessary sex scene, at which time we quit watching.  A waste of time and money.  .",1440979200,,215,4.095238095238095

6683087,5,B00NWIFYQC,"I am a big fan of Danish TV series. Love Borgen, and was excited when I heard about this one. We liked this series more with each episode. The character development makes the series more than just a crime series. The characters are all engaging, and at the same time dealing with their own flaws and foibles. The settings and camera work are interesting. The series is supposedly based on actual events so I am often amazed at the short sentences the criminals receive. But maybe more humane?????",1436832000,,496,4.6477272727272725
6683088,4,B00NWIFYQC,"Well acted series whose plots, acting, and production improves during the course of the season. In the later episodes, the cast seems more at ease and the stories are more exciting. Definitely up to the level of the Scandinavian crime and detective shows!",1436400000,3,255,4.953488372093023
6683089,2,B00NWIFYQC,Really could not get into this series. It didn't hold my attention like other police dramas have.,1435968000,,97,4.764705882352941
6683090,5,B00NWIFYQC,"Loving it!  Only have a couple of more episodes in Season 1 and then looking forward to starting Season 2.  Really good detective story with very interesting and likeable characters.  Each episode is a new mystery, except for a couple that take two episodes to complete.  I am really caught up in the characters and their on-going story lines as much as the individual mysteries they solve each episode.",1435276800,2,403,4.797101449275362
6683091,5,B00NWIFYQC,"An excellent Danish television crime drama, with superb performances from Charlotte Fich, Mads Mikkelsen, Lars Brygmann, Waage Sand, Erik Wederse, Trine Pallesen and Lars Bom.  Lighter in tone than the Danish/Swedish international smash The Bridge (Bron/Broen), Rejseholdet (Unit One)winner of the 2002 International Emmy Award for Best Dramais nonetheless a thoroughly engaging and highly compelling offering.",1435017600,4,410,6.321428571428571

6683098,5,B00NWIFYQC,"I know my American TV crime dramas, and this Danish crime drama is the best in the genre that I have EVER seen.  Everything is magical....The extraordinary ensemble cast blends so beautifully; the scripts are tightly woven and keep you on the edge of your seat.  I purchased this because I'm a fan of one of the stars, Mads Mikkelsen (TV's Hannibal), but I love all the actors and the characters they play.  Mads does not disappoint.

6683104,5,B00NWIFYQC,I enjoy the MHZ international mysteries.  Unit 1 is one of the best.  The acting is great and the plot is straight forward crime solving.  The show portrays quite a lot the personal side of the crime solvers.  The story plot and acting makes this show may more believable than American TV.  The Eagle is another Danish show that I like.,1424476800,5,336,4.442622950819672

8680774,5,B00NWIFYQC,Superior series from Denmark. Highly recommended,1519257600,,48,7.166666666666667
8680775,3,B00NWIFYQC,"Typical Danish TV show:
1) involves a detective/police/gov setting
2) a gory gruesome murder is shown in detail and up close (and repeatedly) each and every episode
3) people are getting in and out of bed with one another, having affaires, living together while having children as if there is nothing wrong with it
4) callous, indifferent attitudes toward sex
5) over the top sensational somewhat disgusting plots in their chase down the rabbit hole to hell (e.g the story about a rapist of old women who makes the women remove their false teeth first)
6) using the same 5 actors that the country smaller in population than my single state offers up
7) rehashing ""Forbrydelsen"" in some way, shape, or form
8) liberal proselytizing",1504656000,,730,4.848

8680779,3,B00NWIFYQC,"Unit One is the name of a Danish National Police unit specializing in supporting local police for crimes calling for expertise that the local forces don't possess. From their mobile headquarters in the back of a semi-trailer, they travel throughout Denmark to solve crimes. The cast is somewhat stereotypical: ambitious new unit head, her gruff boss, an outside-the-box, impulsive but effective rule-breaker, a computer/logistic geek, a physically tough truck driver, a cerebral, crime scene specialist who appears to have psychic powers, and an elderly and experienced detective who holds all the others look up to. Each of the 32 episodes are based on an actual crime and the criminal may or may not be known to the viewer right away. Time and place are labeled onscreen at the start of new scenes, just like the Law and Order franchise and, at the end of each episode, the results are noted, like the old Dragnet series. The light sentences consistently surprised me. If you're going to commit murder, do it in Denmark! It won an International Emmy for best drama in 2002 so it obviously has done some things right. It is well-written and well-acted. Mhz International Mystery viewers  will recognize Waage Sando and Lars Brygmann while Mads Mikkelsen, a James Bond villain (Casino Royale) would be the best known. There is lots of smoking, some nudity, a bit of gore and lots of swearing. Lots of swearing. Are Mhz translator adding f-bombs to shock provincial Americans? The frequent family backstories, no doubt to flesh out characters and show the toll crime-fighting takes on police, slows the otherwise decently pace police procedural. Four of the five men in the unit are cheating on their significant others which, I suppose, is meant to show how fallible they are. Popular enough to run for 32 episodes when most Scandanavian series seldom run one-third that long, it is a good but not great series.",1491436800,,1911,4.971875
