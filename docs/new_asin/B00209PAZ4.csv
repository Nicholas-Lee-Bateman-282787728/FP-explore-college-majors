8348478,5,B00209PAZ4,"This slide is cooler than a polar bear's toenails.

I don't play many slide only songs. It's a pain wearing a full tube slide and then trying to strum or fret regular notes with a big old tube on your finger.

Will Ray, in addition to being an amazing guitarist, is apparently a design genius as well, because this little ring slide is just the ticket around this problem for me.

For what you'd pay for just a slide in many cases, you get a ring slide and a great DVD showing some techniques to use with this accessory.

I can slide some notes, then fret some with the same finger with no awkwardness like before.

Heck, this thing even sounds cool on bass guitar.",1347580800,2,665,4.288
