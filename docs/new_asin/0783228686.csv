53533,4,0783228686,"This is one of those DRIVE hard action movies that has a couple of big rigs in it along with some cars.  A lot of vehicles get trashed in the process and there is driving action in the hills and on a freeway (and a town in between).

This is a ""good guy gets pushed into a compromising position (for his family) never seeming to get a break while everyone's against him"" type of movie where in the end it all comes out OK just fine!

It's not going to keep you guessing very hard during the movie so the end will not be much of a surprise either.  It ends OK for all but the bad guys (with one exception to that rule for one maybe good guy).

It's pretty clean and OK entertainment for all involved.",1459900800,,699,4.036231884057971

Here you have a total Baddass Played by Patrick Swayze, that could have been enough, yet they throw in Randy Travis as a trucker who coincidentally writes songs, and Meatloaf wearing Bolo tie. I'm sold on that but they also throw in top notch performances by Graham Beckel (the better, republican Beckel Brother!), the Bra lady from Seinfeld, The guy from Rudy, and I think Steve Perry (or at least someone who looks close enough to be Steve Perry).  This movie teaches the true meaning of what makes a good trucker (spoiler alert Swayze's character has it!) now when I drive down the highway I will always look out for the black dog and drive the way that Swayze does!",1441843200,,816,4.469798657718121

53639,3,0783228686,"I honestly wasn't expecting too much from this movie, but for what I got I was entertained and never bored. BLACK DOG is a fairly standard late-90's B-grade action movie, but its colorful characters help it to transcend the genre cliches and make it somewhat memorable. The basic plot is that Jack Crews (Patrick Swayze) is in need of some extra money and agrees to take a truck-driving job transporting some goods. Little does he know that it's some illegal guns, and soon he has people on his trail as he tries to make the delivery.

 I've never been too much of a Patrick Swayze fan, mostly because I don't think he can act that well. He has some charisma, for sure, but the only movie I've really enjoyed him in prior to this was ROAD HOUSE. Here, he doesn't get that kind of a role to play, but thankfully the supporting players pick up the slack and make the movie worth watching. Of those cast members, the most entertaining were Meat Loaf as a Bible-quoting madman, and Charles Dutton and Stephen Tobolowsky as a bickering FBI and ATF agent, respectively. Their short scene that opens the film is, in my opinion, the best part and sort of sets the tone for what follows, at least when they're onscreen. Randy Travis also has a supporting role, but all they can do with him is make jokes and references to his real-life career as a country singer.

 In general, the acting was decent for this type of movie. The action, of course, was well-done. By virtue of being produced before Hollywood became obsessed with CGI and shaky-cam, this film features real stunts, real explosions and crisp, clean action sequences done with some flair. Yes, having cars and trucks explode on impact in a collision is ridiculous, but it's also ridiculously entertaining to watch. Most importantly, the truck-driving sequences were filmed in an interesting way, and actually on the highway. Other positives I can think of are a suitably bombastic score and some gentle soundtrack cuts courtesy of Randy Travis. I don't really care for country music, but he's one person I can tolerate.

 The negative aspects I can mention are all fairly standard for the genre. There's a lot of plot holes, story threads that aren't followed up on (or at least satisfactorily), and of course the premise. Part of this can be chalked up to the run time. At 89 minutes, it is a little light on story and character development, but then again it didn't exactly need to be complex. Overall, this was much more fun than I was anticipating. It's by no means a good movie, but it's pretty entertaining for what it is. When all is said and done, there's a lot worse ways to spend your time. Also, they do explain what the title means, in case you were wondering.",1418428800,,2725,4.619834710743802

I had never heard of him  before this movie sadly however I knew who Randy Travis was so I gave the movie a shot! I am very glad that I did, This movie has plenty of action, explosions, and is not slow moving. The thing that I loved most about Swaze's character though was he took the old black Semi over the new red one with all the bells and whistles and showed that he was a real truck driver who was going to get the job done in a truck that had already been well used and proven itself.

I would recommend these three movies to any that wish to see Swayze movies. Black Dog, The outsiders, and Three wishes. If your a girl you will more than likely enjoy dirty dancing as well.

53726,3,0783228686,"With generous amounts of vehicular mayhem, Black Dog (1998) delivers what director Kevin Hooks (Passenger 57) intends, a violent, over the edge, high action ride.  It is soon established that realism isn't much of a concern, as persons unknown attempt to hijack a truck making a run from Georgia to New Jersey.

In a tragic accident, big rig driver Jack Crews (the late Patrick Swayze) struck and killed some people with his truck.  After doing time for manslaughter, and losing his truckers license, Crews now works as a mechanic.  Financially strapped, Crews accepts a job offered by his employer Mr. Cutler (Graham Beckel), to make an illegal run up from Atlanta.  Unknown to Crews, the truck is loaded with a shipment of weapons, and is the subject of a joint FBI and ATF investigation.

Down in Georgia, Red (Meat Loaf) the Bible quoting owner of R & H Trucking, lays down the law.  Crews and Earl (Randy Travis) will be in the rig, escorted by a blue Camaro containing Sonny (Gabriel Casseus) and Wes (Brain Vincent) as backup.  The crew are on the road for a short time, when the first attempt to hijack the load occurs.  Things get extreme really fast, as Crews leaves dead men and burning wreckage in his wake.  Discovering that the shipment includes assault weapons, hardens Crew's determination not to be stopped, but the stakes get even higher, when his wife (Brenda Strong), and daughter are taken hostage.

Once momentum is established, the level of violence remains high up through the finish.  Most of the action is vehicular, as cars, trucks, and motor cycles, bang, bump, skid, crash, spin, flip, and explode.  The stunts and action are the high points of the film, and they are for the most part, nicely executed.  The unstoppable truck has the starring role, and runs over, crushes, and obliterates, whatever gets in the way.  Swayze and Travis make a pretty good team, while Charles Dutton and Stephen Tobolowsky head up the law enforcement side.  Meat Loaf as the fanatical Red, and the wild-eyed Beckel as Cutler, make shallow, but colorful villains.

A straightforward action feature with bone-jarring hits, and heavy doses of vehicular destruction, Black Dog delivers a truckload of mindless fun.",1279670400,2,2221,4.911528150134048

53742,3,0783228686,"Black Dog is about Patrick Swayze being an outlaw trucker. Meatloaf and Randy Travis both star in this as well.

I have a fairly high tolerance for silly movies, and I really like Patrick Swayze. So I'm willing to cut this movie a lot of slack. This review gives away a few plot points - but don't worry, none of them will be a surprise to you when you watch anyway :)

Patrick is a guy who accidentally killed someone while driving a truck. He saw the ""black dog"" - he in essence was driving for too long, spaced out, and ran someone over. I want to make a side comment here that I once drove off the road because I pushed myself too hard and drove while sleepy. It is SO important to take regular breaks while driving and to stop if you're tired.

So anyway, Patrick goes to jail, comes out, and now his wife is about to lose the house. He needs money and his corrupt boss offers to bail him out in return for running guns. Everybody in this movie is pretty much ""all good"" or ""all bad"" so there is little question who you cheer for.

The movie has probably every car-chase cliche in the book. Cars that crash burst into HUGE fireballs a la a nuclear explosion. Many jumps are worthy of the Dukes of Hazzard. They throw in a lot (probably too much) of arcane trucker jargon to give something cool to the film.

The plot is both predictable and exceedingly silly. I'll give an example from near the end of the film. Everything looks like it's wrapped up even though Meatloaf is still on the loose. So of course the cops tell Patrick ""OK even though this huge criminal situation is wrapping up, we won't interview you or anything. Here, take this evidence-filled truck, with your wife and kid, and go drive around in it."" This struck us as exceedingly silly. Oh, they give him his license back too. So there the family is driving around and sure enough, Meatloaf shows up in his own truck.

So there they are, chasing each other around a train yard. My boyfriend goes ""OK so Meatloaf is going to die going head-on into a train"". I'm saying ""well given the nuclear level explosions of the past, he is going to die in a gigantic fireball"". A few seconds later, Meatloaf goes head-on into a train and bursts into a huge fireball. It was just too funny :)

This is not nearly as engaging at Swayze's other movies. His other characters had a past and texture. Here he is very one dimensional. His relationship with his wife seems forced. The buddy situation seems forced.

I'm glad I saw this once, but unlike Swayze's other movies, this isn't one I'll be watching repeatedly.",1208131200,,2571,4.38655462184874
53743,5,0783228686,as a truck driver there are lyths and legends this isn't one of them but it s a very good movie,1191974400,,95,3.5714285714285716
53744,2,0783228686,"I really wanted to like Black Dog I really did. Unfortunately it hovers between watchable and turn it off for most of the film. The few action sequences in the film are clever ideas however they do not leave the viewer with the same excitement as many action clips. I felt bad for the actors, almost all of which are very good, because the script is very bland even for an action. The characters are very 2 dimensional and are not very original. You have The Loner, The Feuding Cops, The Lovable Oaf, The Stupid Kid, Token Black Guy that will inevitably die, The Religious fanatic, The hostage mother and daughter, and the just plain rotten guy. Many plot details will seem very familiar as well. The fact is with so many road movies out there there is a high bar in which directors must compete with. Had a better Screenwriter at the helm and focused more on the characters with more and better action sequences this could have been a fantastic film but what we get is a very lackluster movie that you actually feel pity for. Pretty much a let down but if you must watch it give it a rental but don't spend your money as there is nothing here worth seeing again.",1184457600,2,1163,4.388888888888889

Red Dawn or Point Break? Watch them anytime. Road House or Next of Kin? Well, maybe not all the way through, but I can always make it to the next commercial break if I'm channel surfing and I see one of them. But this is so absurd, with such endless data dumps where Mr Swayze has to explain to the other characters his own back story or the inner workings of truck brakes (yawn on both counts), and with villains who are beyond comic relief to being just Darwin award winners, that it's impossible to sit through.",1175472000,10,677,4.338582677165355

53747,1,0783228686,"First off, we're given a character that we can't really like: a man who lost his CDL and just got out of prison because he got into an accident that killed someone. Accident or not, someone died through his carelessness and/or incompetence. So what do the filmmakers do? Put him back behind the wheel. Strike one.

Swayze, in addition to driving illegally, is smuggling. Despite his supposed remorse for his prior offense, he has no problem taking a job that any moron can see is a shady deal.  Big strike two.

One of the most ludicrous scenes is when his wife and daughter are kidnapped. The mom runs through the house screaming her daughter's name. The daughter turns around from the bathroom mirror with a blank-faced ""Huh?"" (uh...she totally missed her mom's panic-stricken screeching?). Then, as a reward for all this misadventure, the FBI cheerfully gives Swayze, the killer-behind-the-wheel, his license to drive again. Strike three, and bye-bye. I have no sympathy for this guy and his whiney family at all.

The director should have let Randy Travis sing for two hours; at least that would have given this film some entertainment quality. If you want to watch a halfway decent trucker movie, rent ""Smokey and the Bandit.""",1170979200,3,1231,4.903846153846154

53753,5,0783228686,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I bought the movie and the soundtrack is awesome. Excellent truck driving in the movie. Very exciting, it kept me intrigued through the whole movie as to what was going to happen next. The acting is very good. Patrick Swayze is such a handsome man, he was the best part of the whole movie, but everyone did a great job. Red and his men got exactly what they deserved. If you enjoy a good action movie....then you will enjoy this one. I would rate it a 10.",1073779200,4,514,4.099009900990099
53754,5,0783228686,"This is a good action movie. If you have never driven a truck, then some of the details of the film probably will be lost on you.

53755,5,0783228686,"The movie's plot is simplistic. Jack Crews (Swayze) and Earl (Randy Travis) must deliver a load of illegal weapons or the terrorists kill Jack's family. In addition, they must fend off Red (Meat Loaf), a fanatical, Bible verse- yelling madman, and his redneck thugs, who are attempting to steal the cargo. Anyone who enjoys explosions and big rigs will like this movie. Red's men try to hijack the guns several times, and each time their attempts fail, usually with some impressive crash. In fact, all of Red's crew are either blown up, splattered all over the pavement, or crushed within a truck cab. There are some good lines about how juice causes gas and what ATF really stands for. It's not the most intellectual movie out there, and Swayze's facial expression never does change, but with the number of explosions and huge trucks, who cares? In any event, you'll find out how deadly trucking really can be.",1061164800,7,911,4.808917197452229
53756,3,0783228686,"Cool sountrack...nowhere near Jerry Reed's heartfelt ""Eastbound and Down"" or ""Bandit.""  Most of the songs are covers.
This time around the hero is driving the truck while ""blocked"" by a Chevy Camaro.
This time around there actually is a country music star bigger than Jerry Reed as a co-star...Randy Travis.
This time around the FBI is the pursuer rather than a lowly and comical ""texas county mounty.""  'Corruption within the the machine' is quite evident.
The original additions that make this movie watchable is the fact that personal/family connections are emulated.  It's not just Cletus stopping in a roadside bar making a call....then gettin beat up for his efforts.  And there is no developing romance between the hero and a ""hitchess"" ( I miss Sally Field!).
The phone calls are reminiscent of the Alabama song ""ROLL ON""!  But with a different struggle for the ones at home.
And as for the Black Dog...well, he's the philosophical vehicle in this film.
Good flick...see it!

53757,5,0783228686,"What words describe truck drivers? Lonely, overweight, loaded up on reds?
When Patrick Swayze's behind the wheel, only one word comes to mind...hero.
In this masterpiece, Jack Crews (Swayze) must drive a truck to save his family from bankruptcy. But first he must overcome his troubled past. On his last haul, years prior, he ran over an elderly couple shopping at a roadside fruit stand.
Crews was sent to prison where he vowed to never drive a truck (or anything larger than a lawnmower) ever again.
Regardless, Crews needs the cash, so he agrees to drive a truck full of guns from Atlanta to New York.
The offer comes from the movie's villain, Meatloaf. Mr. Loaf gives a superb performance. The very gravy of his character has lumps...lumps of hideous greed.
The true crime is how many people have not seen this movie. Swayze proves heroes can exist beyond ""Road House.""
The journey into evil reminds me of ""Apocalypse Now"", while the cars and trucks remind me of ""Smoky and the Bandit.""
This movie has joy, sorrow and anger at every turn of the odometer, and is sure to be a classic. So brilliant is this film that, despite its complexity, you'll ask only one question at  the end. Where is the Black Dog, and is my turn to walk it?",1042070400,4,1236,4.592760180995475

The acting in this movie is terrible, especially Swayze's neverending wooden facial expressions.  The plot is equally bad, and is never very engaging.  However, the one thing that saves this B-movie from being so bad it's unwatchable are the scences with Meatloaf quoting Bible verses while trying to kill Patrick Swayze and the hilarious bits about the black dog.  So, don't expect a quality piece of cinema, but if you're bored and need a laugh, it's worthwhile.",987206400,2,641,5.066666666666666

53770,5,0783228686,"When this blockbuster smash first came out, critics labeled it a disappointment, assuming that Swayze had exhausted his luck following a string of successess (Next of Kin, Roadhouse, etc.)...WRONG!  This flick  rises the norm and breaks into an entirely new realm of success.  With a  dynamite cast featuring Swayze and the mulit-talented Randy Travis and Meat  Loaf, ""Black Dog"" confronts the viewer with a shockingly thick  plot in classic old-school style.  In doing so, director Kevin Hooks could  have a three-year-old ""hooked"" on his latest materpiece.  Believe  me folks, this one has plot has more twists than a bag of pretzels, and the  action is viciously gripping.  It is simply impossible for the viewer not  to drewl over the determination and unrelenting genius of Swayze, a  no-nonsense man of fantastic proportions.  His performance is so convincing  that the viewer would, without hesitation, wager his or her life on Swayze  to prevail in any situation...a true sign of a modern revolutionary hero on  the silver screen.  As for his supporting cast, the word sensational is  what comes to mind. While Randy Travis' performance is certainly  Oscar-worthy, Meat Loaf's portrayal of ""Red"" puts other actors in  the field to shame (with the exception of Swayze of course.)  Any watcher  remaining in his or her seat following Red's final deliverance should have  their pulse checked...and that is no exaggeration.  For fear of ruining the  movie's development to those shockingly naive people who have somehow  managed to avoid viewing ""Black Dog"" to this point, I will  conclude my analysis of this classic with one simple analogy...""Black  Dog"" is somewhat like an epidemic, for once it surfaces, it is nearly  impossible to contain.
