8727709,5,B013HOZJPG,"Wow, the Japanese really screwed up on their design.  Go figure, you would think Japan of all countries would be the most conservative.  Placing emergency power generators in the basement where they could be flooded, when the plant is next to a shoreline, was beyond dumb.  Program reveals that a critical relief value that could have averted the resulting chemical (hydrogen gas buildup) explosion lost its remote control ability and no provision for emergency manual operation existed.  Makes me glad I am not anywhere near a nuclear power plant.  If a conventional power plant has a disaster you can start rebuilding the next day.  If a nuke has a disaster wait 100,000 years, then okay to rebuild.  Not worth the risk.",1489708800,,722,4.917355371900826
