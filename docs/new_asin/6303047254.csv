542011,1,6303047254,"Tim ROth always accepted projects he judged would be different, that would have real potential to show his great talents as an actor. So, how he could have agreed to do this crap? MAlkovich is also in the same league.

542012,1,6303047254,"Conrad must have shuddered from yonder heaven when this miserable adaptation graced the screen. That such prestigious actors should prove so totally incapable of portraying with some semblance of integrity such great  characters and that the director could permit-or initiate- such a total  ""rape"" of this great work speaks volumes on the cultural level of  Film today. I had hoped to use it in my class but I will stick to  ""Apocalypse Now"".",954892800,11,442,5.013698630136986

542014,5,6303047254,"This film may differ somewhat from Conrad's book but hey the story isn't the thing it is the atmosphere that counts and this nightmare of a trip to the Heart of Darkness comes across just as Conrad intended it- that's for  sure! Tim Roth as Marloe is heartbrakingly fragile and John Malkovitch is  excellent, too. See this as an independent piece of art. Then it works.",928886400,12,369,4.575757575757576
542015,2,6303047254,"While watching Heart of Darkenss, it became clear to me that this movie was nothing like the book. I found the book to be interesting, and to have a faster pace than this movie.  This movie shows Marloe on a slow trip down  the Congo.  It tells us why he is going, and that the man hoarding all the  ivory is crazy. But, you have no idea why this man who is keeping all the  ivory went crazy.  The director tries to play out the length of the trip  down the river, but justs ends up making it more confusing.  You continue  to see someone with a bag of some sort over their head, killing people.  You have no idea who this person is, and why they are  killing Marloe's  men.  Random camera shots of nothing add to the confusion of the movie in  general.  The cinimatography in this movie is hard to follow, because  somebody will be talking about ivory, and it will show a white face, which  appears often.  I found this movie very confusing to watch, and would  recommend the book over the movie in a heartbeat.",923356800,8,1012,4.231578947368421
542016,4,6303047254,"Conrad's look at imperialism and the destruction of Africa was an allegory shown by the inner destruction of Kurtz. This film plays out the slow trip of the short novel -- as slow and monotonous as the trip up the river was  for Conrad -- an ocean sailor. But the Kurtz character gets lost in the  mystery -- and his dark machine-like ablilty to kill is shown only in the  contrived yet riveting scene with a pet monkey. Even the skulls are  downplayed. Here too Kurtz is allowed to die and be buried in his village  by those who ""love"" him rather than having him die on the way  back -- for affect? It is an uneven and, at times, a slow piece. We don't  find out much about Marlowe as well. But we get a true sense of Marlowe  wishing to spare Kurtz's lover with a lie -- just as those selling ivory  chose to lie about the circumstances.",914371200,15,839,4.19375

542118,4,6303047254,"This is a movie that I bought specifically to watch prior to reading the book.  With Conrad's writing being so dense and somewhat heavy, I felt it would help me to watch the story on film first.  I was pleased that I made that decision.",1402790400,,236,4.222222222222222
542119,4,6303047254,"Unlike many other reviewers I enjoyed this movie. I originally saw it televised and I watch it again every couple years. I think some viewers judge ""Heart of Darkness"" harshly when reflected alongside ""Apocalypse Now"" I think without the comparision, ""Heart of Darkness"" stands as a fine movie.

""Heart of Darkness"" is subtle, dark and beautiful. It does not offer commentary or explanation. It is a fascinating character study of Marlowe and Mfumu especially; along with DeGriffe, Gosse, Captain Fenard, and a fascinating mix of players. Great casting on many interesting side characters and the various roles they play in a complex business of human exploitation and greed. Some of them go mad from what they see.

I would give the movie five stars right away for Tim Roth as Marlowe and Isaach De Bankole as Mfumu. The friendship between the two is based on inner understanding between them. Roth plays Marlowe as a contained observer, something he does extremely well. In the midst of violence he (rightly for survival in this place) looks cool on the surface. He is just the sort of actor to play this. You can sense he knows how to endure without cracking in the moment but that the experience will never leave his inner world.

I don't even know how to explain Isaach De Bankole as Mfumu. I've never seen someone portrayed with such strong inner conviction. Mfumu comes from a whole different world. Marlowe says his people are still cannibals. Yet there is a strong morality within Mfumu. He tries to protect the wards under his care. Once he is dedicated to Marlowe, he is dedicated for life. Other people may judge Mfumu for beliefs and practices that the ""civilized"" world cannot understand, but his heart is true.

Like the book, by the time Marlowe finds Kurtz (Marlow's whole quest was based on finding him) the story seems somehow anti-climatic. I wonder that it is inevitable -- that the man Kurtz -- spoken about so often beforehand that he became somehow mythological -- is such a disappointment.

Marlowe finds Kurtz ill and close to death. I don't know what I was expecting from Malkovich in his role as Kurtz, but I was more troubled than enchanted about it. (also, perhaps the point) He  seemed off and not-present, speaking with disjointed pauses. When Tim Roth as Marlowe comes to see him it feels like there is no energy exchanging or real interaction between them.  Perhaps there is no other way it could be.",1259798400,3,2434,4.794749403341289
542120,5,6303047254,"This movie has to be seen only after reading the book.  If I truly feel the movie deserves five stars the book is six.  Often people confuse media. This is a movie it is not a book. The book is not a movie.  Yes, they will be different.  For one thing is you are going to watch the movie one time, forget it, you will probably not enjoy it and you will be utterly confused.  This movie requires several viewings.  The first viewing may be a silhouette of white noise, flat and static.  Further viewing, in the right frame of mind, adds dimension and clarity to the story.  Do not watch this movie with a sweet wine.  This will leave a terrible taste in your mouth by the finish.  This movie is best watched with a Sam Adams.  The wonderful bitter hops of the Sam Adams complements the story.  For Gosh sakes watch this movie all the way through three time.

542121,2,6303047254,"I caught this on Cinemax - a bad sign to begin with.  Given the cast and director one would expect a lot more.  Tim Roth wanders through the film giving an uninspired performance, spending most of the time looking exhausted and expressionless, occasionally rising to peevishness.  Malkovich - whatever happened to that very gifted actor?  It might have been around this film where he just started phoning it in.  He looks like Miss Favesham (Great Expectations) in drag (that would be a woman dressed as a man), listlessly mumbling, draped in tatters.  We know Kurz is on his last legs, but there is no sight of the greatness that Kurz supposedly embodies.  And I was quite surprised to see that it was directed by Nicolas Roeg - it seems that all involved were just in it for a paycheck and a trip to Africa, or wherever it was filmed.  The directing is flat, editing odd, though there is the occaisional cinematic sunset or sunrise shot - but how difficult is that.  The supporting cast provide good, if overly buffoonish at times characters.  Edward Fox is quite good, but is only in the film for a few scenes.  Perhaps Cinemax edited it - that is my guess, but from what I saw, this is a big miss.  Malkovich's rendering of the final famous words is so drab, so unremarkeable that it is almost laughable.  Brando's much maligned performance - quite unfair in my opinion - rises far above Malkovitch's anti-climatic appearance.  He looks like a disease ridden fop, slumming it in the tropics, unable to muster the energy or the interest to do anything but mumble and roll his eyes.",1245024000,,1584,4.630824372759856
542172,1,6303047254,"The negative comments by others some it up pretty well. A tedious film, badly acted and badly made. Boring. Good actors who made a turkey.",1172361600,3,138,4.56
542173,2,6303047254,"I sort of knew it wouldn't be good when I rented it and I didn't even know it was a Made-For-TV-Movie then (my bad). Well anyway, it's the movie adaptation of the classic novel which is also the basis for Apocalypse Now. It does have some good acting from Tim Roth, the main character, Isaach de Bankole as their black helper who is also a cannibal, Morten Faldaas as the harlequin (the hippie in Apocalypse), and John Malkovich as Kertz (Brando's character). The problem is that the directing is pretty horrible. For most of the movie nothing happens and then the actual exciting part (where he meets Kertz) is way too short. The movie is very confusing and it doesn't really show what's supposed to be so significant about Kertz.",1123286400,6,731,4.630769230769231
542174,4,6303047254,"I was curious about this film when I heard about it years ago. I love Nicolas Roegs early work but saw that his later movies were weaker and it seemed Roeg had lost his magic. ""Heart of Darkness"" is a Nicolas Roeg film and it's quite nice to see the old boy has still got it in him. The subject matter suits his odd style of film making. A good film. DVD please!!!",1029456000,8,364,4.0
542175,4,6303047254,"Lights!  Camera!  Action!  These are the three words which cause the distinction between books and movies.  When making a movie based on a book, there are additional factors to be taken into account, thus altering the movie from the book.  However, usually these changes just serve as tools to enhance the story, making it more interesting to the audience it is targeting.  The movie, ""Heart of Darkness"" is an excellent adaptation of the novel because everything matches up well with the descriptions used by the author, and it captures the true essence of the story on film.
  Set in the wild depths of Africa, the tale slowly unravels as a determined seaman, Marlowe, sets out on a journey to Africa, and soon finds himself on a dangerous expedition in search of a missing ivory manufacturer, who has deceived many people waiting for their ivory.  The fact that Africa is such an incredible place filled with fascinating cultures is clearly shown by the settings and casts chosen for the movie.  The story is told from Marlowe's point of view, as he is telling the story to group of sailors on a boat.  Although the time of day during which Marlowe told his tale was switched from evening to daytime, the same effect is produced because each scene in the movie is so vivid and engrossing, therefore each providing its own effects.  The setting for each scene perfectly suits the events which take place.  The setting has a very big impact on the plot of the story because one purpose of the story is to depict the true meaning of life in Africa, particularly the uncivilized nature of some of the people that live there, or that have been there too long.
  The catchy music chosen to accompany each scene, and the simple, but realistic costumes chosen for each character, set the ideal mood that is necessary in conveying the tale.  The music consists of rhythmic drumming mixed together with strange noises similar to those of a person gasping for air, or breathing loudly.  The drumming fits in with the African theme and like a drum roll, it adds a hint of suspense and foreshadowing to each scene, which is also expressed by the book.  An essential part of making of movie is choosing the ideal cast.  Each character fits his/her description in the book, allowing for the vague images in one's mind while reading the book to actualize and come to life.
  My favorite part of the movie was when Marlowe finally finds the place that Kurtz resides.  When he arrives, a crazy guy, who has gone mad from being in the jungle, welcomes Marlowe to the area.  I think that this scene is crucial to the plot of the story, because it is the point at which Marlowe finally finds Kurtz.  Once he reaches Africa and found out about the unjust doings of the mysterious Kurtz, he makes it his mission to find him.  Although the insane man standing at the entrance seems like a trivial character, I think that he actually represents one of the major themes conveyed in the book.  This idea is that people can often go mad from living in the jungle too long, which is what happened to Kurtz.  Kurtz finally reveals himself, much to Marlowe's relief.  However, due to Kurtz's sickliness and insanity, it was difficult for Marlowe to communicate with him.  During this scene, another important idea that is stressed is the uncivilized nature that is constantly shown throughout the book.  An example of this is when Kurtz nonchalantly breaks the neck of an innocent pet monkey, while it was affectionately draped around Kurtz's shoulders.  This part of the movie encompasses many ideas shown throughout the story, making it an important scene.
  My favorite character from Heart of Darkness is Marlowe.  I admire the determination he possessed when achieving his goals.  He deals with many tribulations as he finds himself in the thick of the jungle.  He becomes friends with an African man, Mutumbo, who soon suffers a painful death by a strange African tribe.  Nevertheless, Marlowe maintains perseverance as he gains strength from every obstacle he is faced with.  His bravery and fearlessness lead him to his ultimate goal of finding the mad ivory producer, Kurtz, and rectifying the ivory situation.  However, it is interesting to see that Marlowe did change during his time spent in Africa.  He completely went against his usual nature by lying to Kurtz's former fiance about something that Kurtz never really said.  I enjoyed seeing the story from Marlowe's point of view, and noting the good traits of Marlowe, that were somewhat tainted by his experience in Africa.
  I highly recommend the movie Heart of Darkness to anybody who likes adventure, particularly someone who read the novel as well.  The movie was adapted very well from the book, despite a few changes.  Each change helped to make the story more realistic and suspenseful.  The cast, the music, the costumes, and the setting, created an exceptional combination, perfectly fitting each description from the book.  Many details in the story are difficult to visualize, therefore the movie is helpful and informative to watch.  The themes are also more apparent and effective in the movie.  Although they each tell the same story, the book and the movie work together to complement one another in conveying the underlying messages of the tale.",1010016000,50,5300,4.829078801331853
542176,2,6303047254,"Starring John Malkovich and Tim Roth, this video was made for an HBO television special.  I was interested in it because I have always wanted to read the original Joseph Conrad novella, which was used as the basis of the very successful ""Apocalypse Now"".  I thought this might be a substitute for reading the book.  Well, it wasn't.  And it might turn just me off to the book forever.
The story takes place in the late 19th century and Marlowe, played by Tim Roth, is an English merchant who is sent to Africa to look for Kurtz, played by John Malkovich, a merchant who has disappeared deep into the jungle and has also stopped the very profitable ivory trade.  The tone of the video is morose and sad as Marlow travels further and further into the depths of the jungle and finds evil again and again, especially when he finally meets Kurtz.
I don't know why I continued to watch because I was totally bored throughout.  It also was difficult to understand some of the dialog. I guess I was waiting for the inevitable meeting between Kurtz and Marlow.  When it finally happened I just didn't care.  The acting was good but the performances were wasted.  My  recommendation:  Don't bother.",1008374400,7,1188,4.609523809523809
542177,2,6303047254,"There is an inherent difficulty in translating any novel into the film. Every reader's experience is unique and so, before the first film draft ever sees the light of the day, there already are thousands of movies in existence. To compete with them is often impossible. But, there are strategies some directors successfully use (see Milos Forman's version of One Flew Over The Cockoo's Nest). Unfortunately, Nicolas Roeq did not. While explaining/simplifying Conrad's masterpiece and repackaging it into a contemporary genre, he lost the plot. He neither remained close to the original text, nor moved away from it far enough to allow his own voice to be heard. As a result, we have ended up with a neither/nor situation that benefits no one. Rather than adding to our understanding of issues and concerns raised by Conrad over a hundred years ago ('the other', the parallels between the outer and inner worlds, the reciprocal impact of colonisation, actual or metaphorical...) Roeq's film, as other reviewer's efforts indicate, adds nothing, and thus falls short of its potential.",989712000,10,1081,5.182857142857143
