4690552,5,B00537T0LK,"At last on Blu-ray! There is a DVD version, a stereo audio DVD, with a much improved viewing and NOW this marvel on BD! It's region A, so I bought a multi region BD to be able to watch it here in Europe. I'll watch it every night for at least a month. This is not just a movie, it's an experience! Of what? Of LIFE! A world in itself, a blend of British and America US, a tender love story, an example of refined manners and exeptional good taste. Van Johnson's skill in playing the blind writer - able to perceive and understand what everybody around him can't,  along with his  looks  suggesting  fear, frustration, disappointment but also hope - is unsurpassed. The well-constructed plot is wrapped in the 50s London, a pub, cold foggy nights, badly lit street corners, all in sharp contrast with the warm and comfortably well furnished apartment, a character in itself, where V. Johnson, V. Miles, C. Parker together face and unravel a thrilling puzzle.",1489449600,3,957,4.578947368421052

4690555,3,B00537T0LK,"Pedestrian plot fleshed out by Vera Miles winsome performance and Van Johnson giving us the skinny after his blind playwright stumbles upon a murder/kidnapping plot while taking a break from his woes inside a typical English pub. Mounted with finesse by director Henry Hathaway, but lacking the expected chills and thrills, this one comes across as more melodrama than memorable thriller. Better suspense movies are out there. The Blu-ray, advertised as restored in 4K, while looking light years better than its DVD predecessor, lacks punchy colors and exhibits a queer fading on the right side of the screen, more obvious in certain scenes; also, suffering from Fox's teal bias, though not nearly as much as some of the other vintage Cinemascope catalog to come down its pike. Bottom line: vintage Color by DeLuxe DOES NOT look like this. Why can't Fox get it right for a change?!?",1488758400,4,882,5.006802721088436
4690556,5,B00537T0LK,"I'm sorry that Amazon does not separate out different media releases of films and television shows. Most of the low reviews you see for this film are due to 20th Century Fox's previous releases of this beautifully shot Cinemascope movie in pan-and-scan unrestored versions. Please note that this review is for the February 2017 Blu-Ray full HD release.

Taking place in 1950s England, the story concerns Philip Hannon, an embittered playwright living in a London flat and completing minor revisions to his hit US play for the British stage. Hannon was blinded some time before the film begins (the details are never specified), but although he gets around quite well with the help of a cane and certain other aids for the blind (a chiming watch, a tape recorder to dictate his plays), he has let the accident change him and break up his romance with his secretary Jean Lennox. For day-to-day ordinary tasks he has hired a factotum, Bob Matthews, an older man who silently accepts Hannon's bad attitude as ""part of the job."" One day Jean visits; while Hannon initially seems interested, he is eventually dismissive of her because he's no longer a ""whole man."" To walk off his frustration, he goes to a nearby pub, and while nursing a drink overhears some, but not all, of a conversation from the Ladies' Bar behind him, and what he hears galvanizes him enough for him to call the police: it sounds as if the man and the woman in the next room are planning to kidnap a child!

Since the police listen to his recreation of the conversation with little interest, Hannon begins to inquire into the possible crime himself, with Jean and a reluctant Bob as his allies, using the overheard conversation and the scent of a distinctive perfume used by the woman at the pub to guide him. What the police refuse to believe, however, really is going to take place, and by inquiring Hannon sets himself up for a great deal of danger.

This is not an action movie, but initially slow-moving and then more desperate as time progresses, like an early Hitchcock film or a British-made Agatha Christie presentation, with several instances of great peril to certain characters. The exteriors were filmed in London to add verisimilitude to the story and the Cinemascope lends itself to beautiful vistas of the Thames from Hannon's windows and the spooky lengths of fog-shrouded streets. The starring cast fits their roles well: Van Johnson as the moody Hannon, who comes alive when he realizes a blind man might be able to make a difference; Vera Miles as steadfast Jean, who throws herself into the investigation, happy to see that Hannon has found a purpose; and Cecil Parker as pragmatic Bob, who has an absolutely wonderful comic scene where he returns dripping wet from following a suspect and proceeds to give Hannon his report while pointedly commenting on the drenching he received during the surveillance.

I can't comment in audiophile terms about the soundtrack; it's Dolby 5.1, I believe, and to these old ears sounds crisp and clean, if perhaps the opening theme being a bit loud. The picture is GORGEOUS; I doubt it looked that good in some of the old-style movie theaters which hurriedly converted their screens for widescreen presentation in the 1950s. The color is so bright and crisp that I made out details in scenes I'd never noticed before and the panorama shots of the Thames are beautiful.

There is a commentary track by film historian Kent Jones, who undoubtedly knows his Henry Hathaway films and other classic movies as well; many interesting facts are presented, but his presentation is very dry, and his voice rather soft. While I'm glad it was included, I probably won't listen to it again. Pity that some remarks could not have been gleaned from Ms. Miles, but as she is in her late 80s, I have no idea if her health would have even allowed her to do so.

If you are a fan of this film and have never seen it in widescreen, you are indeed in for a treat! This is the release we've all been dreaming of. Indeed, the only bad thing about it is the cover, which portrays a scene that never happens in the movie: no woman in a low-cut red gown is ever grabbed from behind!",1487808000,3,4178,4.700819672131147
4690557,1,B00537T0LK,5 stars for the film. But how many times will we have to ask Amazon not to mix reviews for different editions? Will they go on forever to just ignore customers and their justified demands?,1487462400,4,188,4.4

4690560,4,B00537T0LK,"A wonderful film - great for those who like a little suspense! Typically ""noir"" style, although a little late for (1956) them while most where produced between the late 30's and mid 50's. Van Johnson, in the male lead, does a fine job, given this isn't his usual movie role.",1481846400,,274,4.5
4690561,3,B00537T0LK,"It is always fine to see Van Johnson and he is quite good in this, but, really, this is like a weak version of Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"".  The disabled protagonist finding out about a crime to be done soon and not quite the....well, not quite the compelling crime at that to put ones life in jeopardy for.  Ugh! quite the bad grammar there.
Oh well, it would have been better if this video had been released in it's original format.  This pan and scan of a CinemaScope format is dizzying.  There are some lovely shots of London and the Thames from the terrace and would have looked better like the film starts in CinemaScope for the credits and looks sharp and bright, but then when it reverts to pan and scan it looks faded and grainy.",1476489600,,736,4.389705882352941
4690562,5,B00537T0LK,"This movie gets better and better as it goes along.

A well-to-do, blind man (Van Johnson) overhears a plot to kidnap a child. He and his butler set out to discover the identity of the kidnapper, and work to prevent the kidnapping. Will he solve the clues? Will he be in time? How will he do this with his blindness?

It is interesting how this determined blind man goes about accomplishing things, which would be difficult for a sighted person. The title of the movie refers to the 23-paces the blind man has counted that it takes him to reach the pub from his apartment.

Shot on location in London (The department store is Barkers of Kensington, which closed in 2006). Vera Miles looks like Grace Kelly in this. She provides an element of friendship and possible romance.

The movie does not tell you that Van Johnson's character is blind until 15-minutes into the film, and it is not obvious before then. Van Johnson seems slow, and his vacant stare is mistaken for bitterness rather than blindness. You are much better-off knowing he is blind from the outset; otherwise, the first 15-minutes of the film is painfully boring.",1467590400,,1129,4.686868686868687
4690563,5,B00537T0LK,"PLOT: blind playwright helps solve a kidnap plot..... GREAT story.

American Phillip Hannon is a best selling playwright. He now lives in London.  He is also blind and bitter. He overhears a conversation in the local pub where a man ""threatens"" a nurse in a kidnap plot. When he reports it to Scotland Yard they doubt his story. Hannon becomes obsesses with it and soon out of desperation enlists both his ex fianc (VERA MILES) and his British Butler Bob. They follow the clues to Lady Surette who tells them about her EX children's Nurse....""Janet Murch"" and the Unity Domestic Bureau. The Unity Domestic Bureau is very 'unhelpful' so they in desperation take out an add with Janet Murch contact us......in the paper.....Janet is found floating in the Tames River and another Children's Nurse is drug into the plot....Bob the Butler follows McDonald the new nurse........to an empty building.....Hannon even has an attempt on his life.....and yet more clues....to Mary ""arriving on the 10th..."" finally Scotland Yard takes this seriously and using Hannon and his clues.....discover a real kidnapping.....but Hannon is being watched and followed by a man who wants him DEAD......great plot ending. Van Johnson is Phillip Hannon and does a very good with his performance of being blind. Vera Miles and Butler Bob are fun and help keep the story moving. Written by Phillip MacDonald. This copy is very good. NO subtitles in this DVD. Still a fun nifty little crime movie. 5 STAR all the way and the plot is excellent....and moves a long very well.",1464134400,,1545,4.961389961389961

4690572,4,B00537T0LK,"A very enjoyable suspense story only slightly dated. Van Johnson plays a blind author who overhears plans for a kidnapping and tries to investigate himself. There are several scenes where his blindness is either a blessing (he notices and hears things others miss) or a curse (he's led into a very dangerous situation because he cannot see it). The final confrontation is still well done and suspenseful no matter how many times I've seen it. Vera Miles does a good job as his would be girlfriend and I love Cecil Parker's manservent. The title doesn't really have much, if anything, to do with the plot.

I was excited to see that one of my favorite films was finally released on DVD.  I searched for it on Amazon.  There it was.  The cover even showed Van Johnson and Vera Miles - AND -- in very large print -- CHECK THE COVER IMAGE -- the very distinctive logo ""CINEMASCOPE"" right there on the lower right corner.  Of course, I immediately ordered the DVD.

Well, got me again.  Flip over to the back of the keep case.  In printing, I'd estimate to be about 4 points high, there it is:  ""(pan & scan).""  If I'd seen it before opening the package and placing the DVD in the player I would have returned it immediately.  But no, I put it in the player, got the disclaimer about ""edited to fit this screen""  uh-oh, and sure enough, after the initial credits in Cinemascope (black box all the way around) the opening sequence -- which is supposed to be a beautiful view of the River Thames and London Bridge -- is a chopped up mess that looks like a tourist's home movie from 50 years ago.

Really, Fox?  The opening credits are in correct proportion.  I could watch it that way or very easily use the zoom feature on either the DVD player or the TV and see the movie as it was made and meant to be seen.  So why chop up the rest of the film?

This is a very good film.  Good plot, acting, directing.  Doesn't assume the audience needs everything spelled out -- as is often the case in modern films.

I found a WIDESCREEN version for sale on Amazon UK -- Region 2.  It has a predominantly RED cover, and says ""The Hollywood Studio Collection"" on the front.  The best I can find for a company with this name is one registered with the California Secretary of State as an LLC with an address in Chatsworth and/or Northridge.

I have purchased the widescreen version.  After it arrives, I will play it I will come back  to this review to add a yea or nay on the Region 2 disc.

Fox needs to get with it.  The type of people interested in these old films want to see them the way they were made.  We are collectors and don't want JUNK copies in our collections.",1380672000,8,2106,4.208020050125313

He gets the assistance of an old girlfriend (Vera Miles) and the butler, tracks down the suspects and solves the crime..........I liked the movie but found Van Johnson's acting to be very annoying. He plays a headstrong theatre writer who can't accept the fact that he has some limitations because he is blind. Result is that he gets into trouble and others have to bail him out....story was good if you can overlook his portrayal of the writer.....for me it ruined a good picture.",1363564800,,735,4.6106870229007635

4690584,4,B00537T0LK,"Like many mystery movie fans, I've waited for decades for this wonderfully atmospheric film to be officially released in the U.S. on home video.  But rather than call it a ""remake"", let's just say it's a worthy ""tribute"" to Alfred Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW, from which it was unquestionably derived.

Although the film is loosely based on a 1938 novel by Philip MacDonald -- which may, in fact, have inspired Cornell Woolrich to write a similarly plotted suspenser in 1942 called ""It Had To Be Murder"" (a.k.a. ""Rear Window""), it nevertheless contains all the familiar elements that immediately identify Hitchcock's classic film as its primary inspiration:

(1) A bored but disabled protagonist who's highly respected in his professional field...who has relationship issues with his beautiful, steadfast, and devoted girlfriend...and who, mainly due to his disability, becomes dangerously vulnerable as a result of either eavesdropping on, spying on, or otherwise injecting himself - sometimes obnoxiously -- into the private business of a total stranger.

(2) A British manservant who provides comic relief -- and becomes the eyes and legs of the protagonist --  la Thelma Ritter's ""Stella"" character in the Hitchcock film.

(3) A law enforcement officer who reacts with smug skepticism to the protagonist's half-baked theories and demands for police action.

(4) A final, climactic, and frightening confrontation with the villain that leaves the hero at a decided disadvantage, again due to his disability, but which he overcomes by utilizing the tools of his profession to confound his attacker.

(5) A (seemingly) happy and sudden resolution of whatever problems had hindered the romantic relationship between the protagonist and his ever-loyal and devoted girlfriend.

The only drawback, of course, is that Henry Hathaway - a respected director of Westerns and a terrific director of film noir - is no Hitchcock.  Missing from BAKER STREET are all the subtleties and thematic nuances of the multi-layered REAR WINDOW, a masterpiece widely regarded as one of the greatest suspense thrillers ever to come out of Hollywood, made when Hitchcock was at the peak of his cinematic powers.

But don't let that stop you from enjoying this terrific ""tribute"" to a classic Hitchcock film.",1362182400,,2279,5.337988826815643
4690585,5,B00537T0LK,"The movie is based on the book Warrant for X by Philip MacDonald. So it has a lot of the same characters as in the movie The List of Adrian Messenger (1963).

The story has changed a tad form the book. Van Johnson plays a blind playwright (they never say how he got blinded) At first being blind seems like a gimmick but you soon get swept up in the film and the great acting by Van Johnson and it seems perfectly normal.

Phillip Hannon (Van Johnson) over hears two people plotting something sinister but being blind he does not know what they look like. He tells the authorities but they fluff him off. So with the help of his man Bob Matthews (Cecil Parker) and his ex-betrothed Jean Lennox (Vera Miles) they track down their only lead Miss Alice MacDonald (Patricia Laffan who played Devil Girl From Mars). We watch as Phil has to use his skills to find the plotters before it is too late.

I watch this movie about once a month like clockwork. I know most of the dialog by heart. At one point Phil tells Bob to call Miss Lennox a taxi; I cannot help myself and say Miss Lennox you are a taxi.

All kidding aside you will also find yourself watching it again and again for the nuances and some things that seem missing as if they cut something out here and there.

8471610,4,B00537T0LK,"If you like mysteries with that suspenseful Hitchcock vibe, then 23 Steps to Baker Street should do ya. It presents a neat twist for a premise, that of a blind man racing against time to solve a mystery. In a concrete way, it borrows plot elements from Hitchcock's Rear Window. Our guy is Phil Hannon (Van Johnson), a celebrated New York playwright who was stricken blind some time ago - the movie never does tell how - and so retreats to London where he spends days and days in private, dictating into a reel-to-reel tape recorder as he works out his next play. In London, he should've been basking in the success of his latest play, but he's become an awfully morose man, a brooding recluse. Not even a surprise visit from his ex-secretary and -fiance Jean Lennox (Vera Miles) could lift him from his low spirits.

You know what lifts his spirits? A visit to the local pub wherein he overhears an alarming conversation between two strangers. The partly drowned-out dialogue was sinister enough that he calls on the constabulary who then courteously dismiss what he has to say. An aggravated Hannon embarks on his own investigation, abetted by his ex-fiance and his butler (Cecil Parker). Hannon knows he's got one week from today before something terrifying happens. But how to scour for the unknown culprits in a concrete jungle crawling with nine million inhabitants? What fun!

This isn't the first - and won't be the last - to showcase a blind detective. At the end of this post, if I remember, I'll tag on a list of movies and books that feature such. Based on Phillip MacDonald's novel, Warrant for X (which was previously made as the British film The Nursemaid Who Disappeared (1938), 23 Steps to Baker Street (1956) has its slow burn moments but also its share of tension and thrills, with the latter bits lively enough that they overshadow the bits that lag. I haven't seen this movie in a while, but I still remember the highlights. Most notably, Hannon's eavesdropping scene in which sound technicians Bernard Freericks and Harry M. Leonard apply these auditory flourishes - muted words, muffled sobs, the pin-ball machine being played in the background - so that, in essence, we're put in Hannon's shoes, hearing what he's hearing so incompletely. There is also Hannon's being lured to a decaying, abandoned building and left there to die and, then, Hannon's having to outwit the big bad in a final showdown in the dark.

Van Johnson isn't my favorite actor here. His character was too prickly and unlikable for too long for my taste. On the positive, it's a refreshing change of pace for him as, mostly, he's known for playing characters with a good-natured disposition. Apparently, this surly playwright hewed closer to Johnson in terms of mood and personality in real life. Vera Miles is fine as the long-suffering ex, even though, mostly, she's stuck playing that girl of even temperament. She does get one late scene in which she's allowed to chew scenery. To me, it's illustrious British actors Cecil Parker and Estelle Winwood who deserve the most propers; they're the secret weapons. Distinguished by Parker's neat touches, his butler ends up being a memorable character and an active equal partner in the sleuthing. Winwood, in the meantime, is simply a joy to watch as the breezy and helpful barmaid. 3.5 out of 5 stars for this movie.

8471611,3,B00537T0LK,"A moderately interesting melodrama starring Van Johnson and Joseph Cotten. If you're a Henry Hathaway fan (raises hand) you may get more out of this than the average viewer. For a nice change, Fox Archive has released one of their widescreen movies in a NON pan/scan format. Though the image is contained in the full frame format, the top and bottom are blacked out. The result looks reasonably decent on my (smallish, admittedly) television. It's probably missing a little information on the sides, but compared to some of the horrible-looking garbage they've released in the past, this disc is not bad at all.",1508371200,,611,4.941747572815534
