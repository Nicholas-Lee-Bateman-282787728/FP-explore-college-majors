2598102,5,B000G1R4SY,"When Gilmore Girls first premiered seven years ago, I admit to watching it for the gorgeous small town scenery (albeit backlot sets). But episode one had not signed off when I was totally and ecstatically immersed in the lives of this gathering of quirky, loveable, diverse Stars Hollow residents. The casting for this show is nothing less than genius, from the main characters of Lorelai and Rory down to townspeople Taylor and Kirk. Sookie is a brilliant best pal for Lorelai, Scott Patterson as Luke Danes is every woman's dream, even Miss Patty played by Liz Torres is a gem of a performance every time she graces the set. Sally Struthers also shines as Babette, the completely eccentric next door neighbor lady married to the 'sexy' jazz icon wanna-be. There are no bad casting choices here...Edward Hermann and Kelly Bishop were made to play Emily and Richard Gilmore. But casting aside, it is the poignant and often times hilarious situations they all find themselves in on a daily basis as they go about their everyday lives in this pristine paradise in Connecticut. Relationship is the key here to every story that unfolds. No episode plays out without the underlying urgency to see some relationship either grow, change, or wither. There is always a metamorphises taking place of one kind or another, and while I am sorry to see the Palladino's say ""Goodbye"", I have faith that season seven will live up to the greatness of the previous seasons. Why? Because anyone who has watched this show with any amount of real attention, KNOWS which direction it should go, KNOWS the feelings and attitudes of the characters well enough to take them in a direction true to the last six years. I only hope in conveying the stories, the new team of writers has the ability to tackle those Gilmorisms for which the show is famous. I will be sad to ever see this show end, it will be like losing close and beloved family...and I will grieve! Thank God for syndication.",1152230400,9,1963,4.7595307917888565
2598103,5,B000G1R4SY,"First, I have to begin this review with what is simultaneously an expression of appreciation and concern.  Very late in Season Six it was announced that THE GILMORE GIRLS creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband Daniel Palladino had not reached an agreement concerning their contract and rather than accept a one-year contract rather than the two-year contract they were demanding, they decided to leave the show.  The contribution of these two individuals over the past six years has been immense.  Their fingerprints are all over the show.  Anyone who has seen or heard Amy Sherman-Palladino interviewed knows that Lorelei Gilmore is essentially an extension of Amy.  She and her husband created a wonderful show and as we head into Season Seven any fan cannot help but be a little nervous about things.  Amy and Daniel wrote by far the bulk of all the episodes and also directed many.  There is a sense in which Amy Sherman-Palladino WAS the show.  So even as I express a tremendous debt of gratitude for one of the finest quality TV shows of the past few years, I'll admit I'm scared about Season Seven.  Season Seven will almost definitely be the final year of the show.  The contracts of both Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel end at the end of next year and Lauren Graham, at least, has indicated that she doesn't see the show going past next year, though she hasn't absolutely ruled out accepting a new contract.

By any standard, Season Six was the oddest in the show's run.  One thing that especially perplexed me was the way that many of the show's opening credits characters barely appeared in the show for long stretches at a time.  In fact, except for Lorelei, Rory, and Luke, all of the characters on the show disappeared for significant periods of time.  More than that, for significant periods of time some characters didn't interact at all.  Until fairly late in the year, Lorelei barely talked to her parents.  I especially missed the dinners that Lorelei and Rory would have at the Gilmore mansion and all of the wonderfully bitchy interchanges between the women.

Season Five ended with Rory moving into the coach house at her grandparents, completely severing things with her mother.  This led to an odd period in Season Six in which Rory did community service (to atone for her legal misdeeds at the end of Season Five) and did some work with her grandmother's DAR chapter.  Meanwhile, Luke accepted Lorelei's proposal.  Things went smoothly until Luke discovered that he had a daughter he knew nothing about (April, played winningly by Vanessa Marano, who manages to do a convincing job of being a complete nerd and a very attractive teen at the same time).  Now, this is where the show lost me in Season Six, along with several friends I have who like the show.  Luke becomes inexplicably protective and secretive about his daughter April, not even revealing to Lorelei her existence for several weeks.  This rightfully bugs Lorelei but she reacts by assuming the worst that this portends somehow the end of their relationship.  Things go from bad to worse, eventually causing Lorelei to avoid Luke in the final couple of episodes, when she suddenly pops up at the diner and delivers the ultimatum that they go elope or end the relationship.  Luke quite reasonably declines such a suggestion from a woman who was acting somewhat hysterical, and the episode and season ends with Lorelei rushing into the arms of Chris, Rory's father.  So, Season Seven will end with Lorelei distraught (given the bleakness of her expression as she lay in Chris's bed in the final episode) and Luke perhaps thinking that their relationship had hit a rocky place but not knowing that she had cheated on him.  Most fans were left feeling that while Luke should have been less secretive about April and certainly shouldn't have kept them apart, Lorelei overreacted in a way that made her character somewhat unbelievable.  Lauren Graham has stated her own disagreements with the course the story in Season Six, so it is good to know that Lorelei herself agrees with the fans.

Oh, and some things happen between Rory and her boyfriend, but I can't be bothered to remember what.  Seriously, does anyone still care about Rory's boyfriends?  I really feel that the show missed multiple opportunities with Rory's love life.  Like most fans, I liked Jared Parecki's character Dean, but I have detested both Milo Ventimiglia's Dean (I don't care if they are a real life couple, they lacked chemistry onscreen) and Matt Czuchry's Logan.  More and more, this is a part of the show I tolerate more than enjoy.

Nonetheless, despite some strains in the plot lines this remained a first rate show.  There is a fictional work mentioned in some novel I once read (it may have been in THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE) entitled THE TRANSFIGURATION OF EVERYDAY LIFE.  In many ways, that describes the real subject matter of this show.  A whole universe of small, recognizable, familiar moments are transgured through their fictional representation.  The dialogue, perhaps not as razor sharp as on earlier seasons, is still about the best on TV.  And after six years, the characters are like a bunch of dear friends for whom we continue to pull.  I'll be honest:  I miss the old formula.  I miss the days when most episodes centered on Stars Hollow and Kirk and Taylor and Miss Patty and Sookie and Michel.  But I respect the way that they have striven to keep the show fresh and new.  That has meant taking the story to some places that might not have been my own first choice.

Let me close by saying that the seventh season will also be the first on the new CW network.  The early rumors are that THE GILMORE GIRLS is most likely to be paired on its usual Tuesday night with VERONICA MARS.  This is going to be a great night of TV.  As much as I love THE GILMORE GIRLS, I absolutely adore VERONICA MARS, which I think along with LOST the best show on TV.  For my money, this will be the best back-to-back hours of the week on TV.  Hopefully they will manage to give a very fine show a proper final season.  The rumor all along has been that they hoped to go seven seasons, ending the show with the graduation of Rory from Yale and the marriage of Lorelei and Luke.  Whether that happens or not, it has been a remarkable run for a very fine show.

Note:  each year Salon.com gives an award named after BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, the Buffy.  It is so named because although in the opinion of many TV critics and scholars BUFFY was one of the greatest television shows of the past ten or so years, and yet was almost completely ignored by the Emmys.  So each year The Buffy is given to the best show on TV neglected by the Emmys.  Last year the Buffy was given to VERONICA MARS.  I assume a show cannot receive the award twice.  If so, I hope that this year the award will go to one of the runners up from last year:  THE GILMORE GIRLS.  It is tragic the way that the rather conservative Emmys persistently ignores many of the best shows on TV to promote lesser shows that appear on the Big Four and HBO.",1149984000,30,7089,4.641252006420546
2598104,5,B000G1R4SY,"I have been a fan of the 'Gilmore Girls' since the second episode of the series (I never saw the pilot until the DVD release), and ever since that episode I had been hooked into this wonderful, magical, comedic, and heartfilled world with these characters.

Season six starts off on a much different note, taking the show in a direction that it has never been: What would things be like if Lorelai and Rory where no longer friends, and never spoke?  After the rift between mother and daughter at the end of the fifth season, Rory dropped out of Yale and moved in with her Grandparents, aliennating her mother, who was eccentially at a loss for words on the entire subject.

Trying to make up for each other's loss Rory starts to go down a path of wallowing and denial as her relationship with Logan gets more and more serious.  Lorelai on the otherhand has a wedding to plan and a new dog to take care off.

Season Six while not as good of an overall quality as season five, is still a very strong and entertaining as ever, and for long time fans of the show there are more than a few surprises including the return of two old cast members, A very special wedding (which is probably the best episode of the series thus far), and a bittersweat goodbye to the series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino who's final episode as an Executive Producer will the finale, fitting titled: ""Partings""

2598287,4,B000G1R4SY,"No need to go into all the details. If you want that kind of a review, you can read any of the others - or, better yet, watch the season! There's a thought! Anyhow, season 6 is really one of the best. Where it starts is just shocking. Things have never been so upside down. The show actually, for the first time, really becomes a darker drama. It looks so good on what is commonly a safe and predictable script. Definitely some of the best writing of the entire series is in the first half of the season. Sadly, after that, things get back to normal (ho-hum) and it slows down again. There's this long-lost daughter of Luke's who appears, which is simply a ""plot"" device to add drama and separate he and Lorelai, which leads into season 7 ... offering the exact opposite of the beginning of season six's brilliance (creator/executive producer Amy Sherman-Palladino purposely sabotaged her show when negotiations broke down with the new CW/onetime WB). Season six is ... nearly ... as good as it gets, but I would just stick with the first three, Rory's high school years, when it was a better show. Once the leads get separated, in season four, things will really never be the same again.",1428278400,,1188,4.55607476635514

Sometimes is silly and rudderless yet I do like most of the characters.  Logan is adorable but thinking Rory will not end up with him. We shall see.  Luke cute but beneath Loralai's social standing.

The dialogue and chemistry between Lorelei and Rory is great. You really get the feeling they are mother and daughter. I also really enjoy their interactions with Emily and Richard. You can really feel the emotional turmoil between Lore and Emily. Now add into the mix the supporting characters from the small town they live in and it is an AMZING show.

2598469,2,B000G1R4SY,"I loved this show and continue to re-watch it from start to finish at least once a year. However, whenever I get to season six, I start getting depressed and it really doesn't lift until midway through season seven. I don't know what the heck happened, but suddenly the character of Lorelai is not the entertaining, forthright, witty woman you know and love - but instead becomes an insecure, immature, and irritating version of her former self. Not only is the inability to communicate with Luke over her fears and worries completely unrealistic, and - SPOILER ALERT - the way he handles the introduction of his daughter is completely unrealistic as well. After Luke goes through all this crap and self-realization to get Lorelai, suddenly he forgets all that and can't talk to his fianc about his feelings or anything? Whatever! And Lorelai! It was her idea to call off the wedding and then she sulks like a brat because Luke agrees. She goes to see Anna and let her know she's ok for April to be around and (after Anna's completely ridiculous over-reaction - I mean come on, lady, being engaged is pretty damn serious) Lorelai just throws in the towel and doesn't bother to talk to Luke about any of it - instead she just gives him a crazy ultimatum and when he freaks out because as he's mentioned half a dozen times before he doesn't like to be pressured! Duh! and she just walks away and does the extreme thing. It's all so soap opera and stupid it just doesn't ring true and I ended up feeling irritated and disbelieving that a 38 year old woman would act that way!
Plus, April is the most irritating character in the history of the entire show - her and her nasally voice and the way they tried to make her into a little mini-Rory was totally annoying - if she had been a tomboy it would have been so much better and have made more sense. (Not to mention - Sherrilyn Fenn plays Jess's stepmother - did they think we wouldn't notice that she's suddenly April's mother??)
Anyway after all that build up for Luke and Lorelai's relationship - it was just horrible and sad to have it fall apart. I feel like there were so many other directions they could have gone with the show and they picked the worst possible route. It gets better in season seven, but not for a while -  and that's a whole other bad review.",1398902400,2,2315,4.472813238770685

2598628,3,B000G1R4SY,"I loved the relationship between Rory and Lorelai; every mother of a daughter (wishes for a daughter like Rory) but you have to watch this series with a big dose of salt.  It's FICTION, so don't believe that any but the luckiet of mothers will raise a Rory.  Nevertheless, it is fun watching their antics and their kookiness.  Occassionaly, Lorelai gets on my nerves.  She is just too flighty and irresponsible - sometimes still the rebellious 16 years old locked in a time loop.  I wish she'd grow up even a bit more.  It's hard to really appreciate her pain with the breakup with Luke because she is the one who pretty much dumped everyone else, except Christopher (whom I think she didn't really love anyway).  I so wished it would work with Luke because they really did ""get"" each other. It was so heartwarming watching their relationship grow. That is another thing that gets me about Lorelai; her anger is so destructive (like an out of control two-year old)! It was realistic thata Lorelai would get fed up with waiting,but once she did, like Rory said, there were other ways to work it out.  Using Christopher, though very human, was very cruel. Rory with Logan is cute, but you can see that there is no future.  Rory's relationships (in past seasons as well as this one) were the one thing in the show that seem realistic.  Good guy, bad boy, fun-but-no-future boy ,it's all in there.  All in all, it was a satisfying season.",1360368000,,1434,4.584313725490196

2598632,4,B000G1R4SY,"Since I first ordered season one I just couldn't wait to order the next season. But season 6 has less pizzazz and more yawns. It's become predictable. There are surprises in most episodes, some of which are the reactions of Lorelai and others. Sometimes Lorelai reacts in a way that is simply not her!
Finding out about April would be a shock, but the writers took her in the wrong direction.
Very poor writing this season, and long before it ends you can tell where they are going with Luke and Lorelai.
Rory has changed way too much! Every girl changes between 16 and 21, but not so much in their morals and values.
If you're a Gilmore Girls fan you have to watch it through to the end, but don't expect the wonderful writing of the early seasons, or the close relationship of mother and daughter (which is what the show is SUPPOSED to be about).
I hope you enjoy it more than we did!",1357776000,,886,4.343373493975903

She seems to be constantly drinking when they clearly say how she is only 20 at the time. She's drinking at a bar too! I love the show, and I get underage drinking happens, but, she seems to never get carded and no one seems to care at all.

I know it's probably trivial, but, I hated how casually they treated her underage drinking, like it wasn't a big deal or anything. Not only do they treat it causally, but, unrealistically.",1356134400,,531,4.31

2598656,5,B000G1R4SY,"A while back I entered into a giveaway on a blog and I won one of the prizes which was a $20 gift card from Walmart. I had completely forgotten about it until I received it several months later. I wasn't for sure what I was going to use the card for. Late one night, I surfed Walmart.com and found the sixth season of Gilmore Girls for fewer than twenty dollars. Of course I had to order it. I have been watching Gilmore Girls ever since I stumbled upon it on the late Soap.net channel earlier this year, but I watch it every weekday morning (if there isn't some kind of marathon) on ABC Family, which had just started airing the sixth season. I received the DVD set very quickly and just like season one and two (that I own on DVD); I flew right through each episode, taking in every bit of the Gilmore Wisdom.

The episodes on season six are:

Disc One:

Episode 1: New and Improved Lorelai (9/13/05)

Episode 2: Fight Face (09/20/05)

Episode 3: The UnGraduate (09/27/05)

Episode 4: Always a Godmother, Never a God (10/4/05)

Episode 7: Twenty-One Is the Loneliest Number (10/25/05)

Episode 8: Let Me Hear Your Balalaikas Ringing Out (11/8/05)

Disc Three:

Episode 18: The Real Paul Anka (4/11/06)

Episode 19: I Get A Sidekick Out of You (4/18/06)

Episode 20: Super Cool Party People (4/25/06)

Disc Six:

Episode 21: Driving Miss Gilmore (5/2/06)

Episode 22: Partings (5/9/06)

There is a lot of emotional baggage that occurs through the sixth season as Lorelai and Rory spend nine episodes apart. During these episodes Lorelai gets engaged to Luke (she is the one who asked), she gets a dog named Paul Anka, and has her house remodeled. Everything changes at the end of episode nine as Rory returns home and Luke finds outs that he has a daughter named April. Unfortunately Lorelai doesn't make it down the aisle, but Rory's best friend, Lane, marries her band mate, Zach.

Season six has a lot things going on in Star Hollows. I felt for Luke as he adjusted to being a father, but he had to push Lorelai away in the process. Did Lorelai overreact about all the April drama? Not really. All she wanted was to be part of April's life as she was going to be her step-mother. I didn't care for the last scene of the season with Lorelai in bed with you-know-who. Overall, I had a blast watching each coffee addicted episode.",1351728000,,2888,4.681908548707754
2598657,3,B000G1R4SY,"This purchase came in a timely manner so when I received it, I began watching it immediately. The very first disc I put in would not play from the beginning. It skipped the whole first scene then was choppy all the way through the second scene. The rest of the discs were fine until I got to the 6th one. The 6th disc skipped just like the first one did. It was very disappointing and frustrating because I had to skip whole segments just to get to a part that played smoothly. I was very annoyed.",1344556800,,497,4.1875
2598658,3,B000G1R4SY,"Season six of the Gilmore Girls is the season the show jumped the shark.  The introduction of a daughter Luke (Scott Patterson) never knew he had really sent the show off the rails.  The season starts with Rory (Alexis Bledel) taking time off from Yale & living in Hartford with her grandparents Emily & Richard (Kelly Bishop & Edward Herrmann) while Lorelei (Lauren Graham) tries to cope and move after Luke says yes to her marriage proposal.  Rory becomes involved in the DAR and Lorelei gets a dog she names Paul Anka and Luke has her house remodeled.  Rory finally goes back to Yale after she realizes that she is good enough to be a journalist despite what Logan's (Matt Czuchry) father said about her not being able to cut it.  Lorelei reconnects somewhat with Christopher (David Sutcliffe) after he comes into a large sum of money, but backs off after Luke becomes extremely jealous.  Luke calls of the wedding temporarily after he finds out about his daughter April (Vanessa Marano) and won't include Lorelei in his dealings with her.  This leads to tension between the two and final blow-up between them when Lorelei puts an ultimatum to Luke which causes them to break-up and the seasons ends with her in bed with Christopher.  In the meantime, Lane (Keiko Ageina) and Zack (Todd Lowe) get married and Logan graduates Yale and heads off to London to work for his father.  While the season still exhibits the sharp dialogue and rapid fire delivery, the transition of Rory towards being an adult and the ultimate break-up of Lorelei & Luke doesn't always ring true to the heart of the show.  Introducing April as a somewhat nerdy, super smart 12 year old (she's basically Rory but a math whiz instead of being into literature) who has a hip, smart talking mother (Sherilynn Fenn) seems ridiculous.  I guess it's meant to show that Lorelei is type of woman he's attracted to since April's mother is just like her.  The season still has its moments, but doesn't hold up to the prior seasons.",1339372800,2,1997,4.706896551724138
2598659,5,B000G1R4SY,"I've been in love with this series since it started all those years ago. I had every season, but this one, so I had to have it. It was brand new, so I was highly satisfied. Plus I got it in the mail very quickly.",1328659200,,212,3.7333333333333334
2598660,5,B000G1R4SY,"Gilmore Girls will always be one of my favorite TV shows. Lauren Graham is amazing in her role as single mom Lorelai Gilmore who over the seasons blossoms from a manager at a local inn to an entrepreneur running her own establishment with her best friend and business partner, Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy). Lorelai is devoted her young daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) who is pretty, intelligent, and confident, though a bit naive when it comes to matters of the heart. Both mother and daughter go through their ups and downs over the seasons, but Season 6 marked a major change in the series in that we see Lorelai & Rory having a huge disagreement, and how this affects their relationship and those around them.

For those new to the series, I'd definitely recommend watching it from Season One, otherwise there are too many blanks to fill in and one would be lost. In Season 6, Lorelai and Rory are estranged because Rory, against Lorelai's wishes, decides to take time off from Yale to think about her future. Lorelai and her boyfriend Luke (Scott Patterson) get engaged, and though their relationship seems very strong, there is a cloud on the horizon. Luke's discovery that he has a young daughter, April, brings him much happiness, but he finds himself unable to confide to Lorelai until it is almost too late. This also places a lot of stress on their relationship.

Despite all of the gloominess that permeates this season, I was still entertained by the various story arcs, the excellent writing, and of course, wonderful acting!",1327536000,,1543,4.818867924528302

Warner Brothers should be ashamed. I would love to get some activist group for disabled people to go after them. I am sure there are viewers that require English subtitles in order to enjoy this wonderful series. So I guess they will just have to miss out on an entire season.

Then besides the English subtitle issue, I too do not like the new packaging where it has 3 pages and one disc on each page is buried under the other, so you have to remove one to get to the other - very bad design and I can not imagine it was any cheaper to manufacture.

Still I could not give this 1-star because I love the series so much. The series is 5-star all the way but the packaging and lack of English subtitles makes me want to give this product 1-star.",1278460800,3,893,4.126436781609195

2598697,5,B000G1R4SY,"I am a big fan of the Gilmore Girls series despite what I see as some flaws.  Unlike some people I really despise most of the scenes involving the town meetings and most of the town's kooky characters except for Kirk, and even he is overdone most of the time.  The town troubadour seems to have no meaning at all and just takes up time.  Miss Patty - why there?  Not an appealing character.  Taylor - ok but gets boring too.  These side characters take time away from the main story too much and for what?  Then main characters whom we love just disappear and nothing is heard of them for a long time (i.e. Jess, Dean).  Whatever happened to Dean and his ex-wife - they are never seen anymore.  Then there is the boring Logan and the boring sappy gushy relationship with Rory which drones on and on without any chemistry between the two of them.  Jess with Rory was so much more interesting and kept us guessing.  Luke with Lorelai both seems right and wrong. What in fact do they have in common?  It's hard to see.  Then if they are so close and nearly getting married why would he hide his daughter from her for two months?  It doesn't make any sense.  I'm on to season 7 now and I won't give anything away but I feel like the show was a mix of great and not-so-great moments.  Much of the dialog is snappy and fun.  Overall I like it but it does have its flaws.",1255651200,,1364,4.204633204633205

2598699,4,B000G1R4SY,"Finally, the show gets a taste of reality.

Lorelai & Rory are on the outs. This happens in real life; Rory learns about herself, grows from the experience and in the end benefits.

Luke discovers he has a daughter. This seems forced, since you would think such a relationship might have been mentioned, at least in passing, in a previous season (more believable to bring back the Rachel character with the child). Still, Luke deals with the news in a stunned, inept, and believable manner. Lorelai doesn't know how she fits in with all this and realizes there may not be room for her. Very understandable. I have to say, the break-up is more believable, albeit sad, than a continued relationship between the two. Too much conflict.

2598749,2,B000G1R4SY,"Just 16 years apart, Rory Gilmore and her mother Lorelai are best friends. They share a love for breathless quip-filled conversation and coffee, frequenting Luke's Diner in the downtown of Stars Hollow, their fictitious Connecticut suburb.

In Season 1, 16-year-old Rory decides she wants to transfer from the public high school to Chilton, a ritzy private school in Hartford. To make it happen, Lorelai has to make the ultimate sacrifice -- beseech her parents Richard and Emily, with whom she hasn't been on good terms since she announced her teenage pregnancy. Although estranged with Lorelai, the elder Gilmores are more than eager to accept their young granddaughter into their lives. They agree to foot the bill -- on one condition. Both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the elder Gilmores' home every Friday evening.

Reluctantly, Lorelai agrees. The resulting Friday night dinners set the stage for much hilarity and snark throughout the seasons -- as well as the occasional glimpse into the Gilmores' sad past, hinting at everything that went wrong in their relationship, well before Rory's birth.

Also seen on the show are diner proprietor Luke, a quiet, loyal friend to both mother and daughter with a building crush on Lorelai; Lane, the Korean-American daughter of a stern single mother and Rory's best friend; Sookie, chef at the Independence Inn, which Lorelai manages; Kirk, a quirky ""townie"" who mysteriously shows up everywhere anyone's doing anything; dance instructor and romance expert Miss Patty; and many others. Rory's father Christopher is also around sporadically, as he and Lorelai fight an attraction which has intertwined throughout their lives, but never seems to work out.

In this season, Luke and Lorelai FINALLY become engaged...making the dreams of many fans become a reality after six years of flirtation. However, just as they've settled into a comfortable routine, Luke learns of a 12-year-old daughter he never knew he had. As if the plot weren't stupid enough, April is essentially a younger version of Rory -- smart, bookish, loquacious and endearingly geeky. Why couldn't they just have given more emphasis on the relationship between Luke and Rory? It's hard to figure out what on earth the writers were thinking -- IF they were at all, that is.",1175644800,6,2295,5.161290322580645

This was an ok season with the exception of the Rory/Logan relationship. I did not think anything could be worse than her last boyfriend but I was wrong! Logan is incredibly annoying, treats her poorly and Rory just lines up for more. Plus, I find it difficult to relate to the 'dynasty' rich crowd that Rory hangs out with. To me they seem foolish and obnoxious. I also hate that most of the major characters are paired up. I miss the 'dating' aspect of the Girls. Having every major character either married or in a long term relationship is boring.

I also think some of the characters need a bit of growth. Emily Gilmore needs to keep a maid, Lorelai needs to take responsibility for her actions, and please, have Rory grow a spine and stop acting like a snob. I liked her so much better when she wasn't acting so bratty.

This was an ok season but nothing that makes me want to stand up and shout.

2598765,5,B000G1R4SY,"You'd think that by the sixth season of a show, viewers would begin to get bored by the perfect relationship Lorelai and Rory have. Well, apparantely they haven't, but even so, it was time for something to change. And here, in this rather painful, difficult season, it all did.

So many people have complained that sixth season did not stay true to its original intention. They say it was a disappointment, that the characters didn't act the way they normally did, etc. They complain that this season was terrible, and that they have lost all hope when it comes to Gilmore Girls. Well, I disagree.

While it is impossible to say that sixth season wasn't different, it wasn't as incredible untrue to its core as some formerly devoted fans would like you to think. It did change, because it had to. How many years can we watch Rory the Golden Girl grow up in a world that is untouched by the ugly realities of the real world? How are we supposed to buy the fact that she hasn't grown or changed at all? While Rory is still our sweet little reader, she's also a college student. She's just as confused as anyone else who has had their hopes and dreams crushed. Her behavior in the beginning of the season WASN'T her. And that's what she soon realizes. All claims that say that Rory is acting out of character are untrue. Rory is a confused kid who doesn't know what to do.

Lorelai, too. She doesn't change. She's always been hot-headed and foolish when it comes to her personal choices. While perhaps this season DISAPPOINTED fans in her personal life, I don't see how the SEASON itself could disappoint someone. These trouble had been brewing for a long time, and all good things end eventually. Lorelai makes mistakes more often than not, and she usually regrets them, but too late. This season also shows her insecurity in some senses, her weaknesses, and most of all her faults. It expands on the things we've always knows, and brings them out to shine.

What is truly different about sixth season? Yes, perhaps it starts out with Lorelai and Rory not speaking, both believing that the other is wrong. Both are showing the childlike stubborness that is one of their character traits (or flaws, depending on who's speaking). Yes, maybe we start to see that Rory and Lorelai's perfect mother/daughter relationship isn't quite as perfect as we'd like it to be, or as it was when Rory was a girl. Yes, there is a touch of drama when a sudden newcomer hits the show and changes the things we love. On the other hand, how can you not love her? How can you not admit that there's something sweet and nice about it, because after all, you know the fear and panic would have come eventually?

In a nutshell, sixth season is about CHANGES. You can't have a show run for this long without keeping things running. Having the perfect daughter, the perfect boyfriend, and the perfect life is unrealistic and dull. Who wasn't shocked by this season? Isn't that the beauty of television? It's exciting and bold. It makes you think. While yes, it was a bit painful to watch the bad things happen and it was hard to watch the painful, inevitable happen, it had to happen, and it was wonderful and terrible at the same time.

To sum this all up, sixth season wasn't the best season, not even close. But it was important, and it was amazing in its own special way. There are still the great actors and actresses, wowing us with great acting. There are still the hilariously quick lines coming from our two lovely heroines. There are still those sad, touching moments you suddenly find yourself crying and hugging yourself. It is THERE that the show has stayed true to itself, and that is the only place it needs to be. It's still a wonderful show, even if things aren't going the way you want them to. You've just got to understand that it's about CHANGES, about growing up and growing old, about life, and most of all, it's about EVERYTHING. The show is still wonderful and running strong.

In regards to the set itself, it's also undergone a change that may not be for the better... The new box arrangement is ""nicer"", but also less practical. The lack of special features was also a bit disappointing, but they'd been disappearing for a while, with each season having fewer and fewer extras and special features.

Don't give up hope. Watch this season, and stick with it. Gilmore Girls is still the superb show you all know!",1171152000,,4409,4.579214195183777
2598766,5,B000G1R4SY,This was one of the best seasons so far. I can't wait for season seven to be available. I am so glad I went to the effort of sending away for it as we are really behind with the series in Australia.,1170201600,,198,3.738095238095238
2598767,1,B000G1R4SY,"I used to be addicted to the show, spending whole weekends watching it. However, season 6 (and also season 7) became a HUGE disappointment. Rory could be nicknamed ""Boring Rory"". Just because her boyfriend's father tell her she doesn't have ""it"" for journalism she jumps out of school, steals a boat and hides herself in her grandmother's house? Give me a break!!! That's the behaviour we expect from a stupid, spoilt and imature little girl, not at all what she used to be in the 5 previous seasons. And after that, it became really hard to imagine what brilliant, cute and funny Logan could possibly see in her to be in love with her. And, after making a complete fool of herself after stealing the boat and jumping out of school, she refuses to talk to her mother, which proved a heartless behaviour.

The non stopping talking, Lorelai's mark, became just annoying, besides the fact she and Luke have no chemistry, although she and Christopher have plenty.

To make it short, the caracthers lost their personality along the 6th and now 7th season. Even in other shows like Friends, when the plots weren't that funny anymore, the caracthers would have the same essence and their personalities didn't change like the ones in this season 6.

A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT",1169942400,6,1263,4.784403669724771

2598770,4,B000G1R4SY,"Let me start by saying this, I loved the other five seasons of Gilmore Girls, but this season has gone down hill a little bit.  The split between Rory and Lorelai killed the best thing the show had going for it, the tag team sarcasm that made the show truly hilarious. Needless to say, when they made up it was a huge relief, and the show improved quite a bit at that point.  The show still offers a ton of witty dialogue that will have you rolling on the floor laughing, but for some reason they decided to get a little more serious this season so that doesn't happen as often as it did in the past.  On the whole it is still a pretty good show, and fairly enjoyable, and  I will continue to buy any subsequent seasons that are released.",1169078400,3,738,4.176056338028169

It folds out and the DVD's sit in three rows of two, on top of each other.  There are NO extras.  Nothing.  Just a ""preview"" of shows on the CW.  No thanks.  Also, every other season offers you English captions (which I appreciate).  This season only gives you captions in French or Spanish.  That does not help me.

However, once reunited, mother and daughter seem to be stronger than ever but poor Lorelai then has to deal with Lukes long-lost daughter showing up out of the blue.  He puts Lorelai on the back-burner and Lorelai's hurt is felt by all as he pushes her away whilst coming to terms with fatherhood.

I won't say much about the storyline, aside from the fact that this season is very different from the others. I, personally, don't like the change, but some might. And in any case, it's GG, and even the worst episodes own my soul.

That said, the poor quality of the DVD set was a shock. The lack of English subtitles is insulting (do they no longer care about people with hearing problems?). Given that this set was priced the same as other sets, the absence of special features was just cheap.

(Hence, I only gave 4 out of 5 starts instead of the 5 that I would give to the other seasons' DVD sets.)

However, the familiar characters did not disappoint in delivering their individual trademark humor mixed into the storyline.  It was refreshing/relieving to see mother and daughter reunited and be able to exchange their daily banter again...

That and the fact that u no longer could choose to have subtitle in english. That was a huge minus in my book. Okay, it may feel a bit unnecessary to have english subtitle on an english serie, BUT if you want to watch it and you cann't use a high volume or so, it helps a great deal with the subtitle. And anouther reason, I'm swedish, and english isn't my mother thoug (hence all the spelling misstakes but deal with it) this means that I have a greater chans of learning new words and such in english, making my english eaven better than it is. :D Otherwise I LOVE this serie it's my favourite serie ever so nothing aganinst the serie in any way.

2598833,4,B000G1R4SY,"There is a wonderful irony in that there were more episodes of ""Happy Days"" after Fonzie jumped the shark than before that fateful episode that has become the iconic metaphor for when a television series jumps the shark, but that is the exception to the rule.  With half of the next season under its belt, I am convinced now more than ever that ""Gilmore Girls"" jumped the shark in the final scene of the final episode of the show's sixth season.  If fans thought they were not happy at the start of season six, with Lorelai and Rory estranged, that has proven to be nothing compared to their dissatisfaction at setting up yet another round of the Lorelai, Luke and Christopher triangle of disaster by season's end.  We start off being disappointed with Rory and end up shifting our disapproval to her mother.

""Gilmore Girls: The Complete Sixth Season"" begins with Rory having dropped out of Yale and into the pool house at her grandparents' house and Luke providing the obvious answer to Lorelai's surprise proposal (""New and Improved Lorelai"").  Things started going badly at the end of the fifth season when Rory fell apart because Mitchum Huntsburger was out to get her just like she thought he was when he told her she did not have it (despite all evidence to the contrary, a point that even Paris should have been eager to point out to Rory).  When Rory was standing in the pool house and turned her back on her mother was the point where I wrote her off as a character and she did not get back into my good graces in season six until she called Mitchum and read him the riot act regarding not coming to see Logan in the hospital (""Driving Miss Gilmore""), which means I was not happy with her pretty much the entire season, especially when she turned into mini-Emily to run the D.A.R. bash (""We've Got Magic to Do""), which is ironically the episode where her grandparents finally get a clue as to what Mitchum had done and that their daughter was (gasp!) right about everything.

Once mother and daughter are reunited the focus shifts to Luke and Lorelai on the road to matrimony, a trip that hits a massive detour when it turns out Luke has a daughter he never knew about (""The Prodigal Daughter Returns"").  But while Luke complains about Lorelai hiding her contact with Christopher (the father of her daughter) he refrains from telling her about April and the aforementioned road gets really rocky. For me the nadir of not only the season but the entire series is ""Super Cool Party People,"" when Lorelai goes to see Anna Nardini, who insists that April should not be around Luke and Lorelai because there is no guarantee they will be a couple.  I was so ticked off by the scene I had trouble sleeping that night because the whole conflict was so patently stupid (and that is without getting into the hypocrisy of the current season with Anna wanting to take April away from every relationship but one by moving to another state).  I can understand that Lorelai wanted Rory to decide she wanted to go back to college and I can understand that Luke did not want Lorelai stealing the spotlight away from him when he is trying to build a relationship with his daughter, but this nonsense about April should not get to know anybody else in Luke's life because there is no guarantee they will be there permanently is ridiculous (how did April ever deal with a new teacher or new classmates each year?).

The high point of season six for me is the montage at the end of ""Friday Night's Alright for Fighting"" (never underestimate the importance of a good sorbet), which I think is the funniest prolonged sequence in the entire run of the series.  The other scene that I find particularly important is when Luke is up on the roof yelling at Lorelai about how he told Rory they were engaged and how he is in the middle of their fight because it is a scene that shows the two of them can have a fight in which they are funny and caring at the same time.  You know, I thought the whole point of keeping the Luke and Lorelai relationship off the front burner for so many seasons was so that when it finally happened the show would continue to work (i.e., unlike the celebrated fiasco that ""Moonlight"" became when David and Maddie finally got together).  Here is where we get to the nub of the problem, because at the end of season six the show loses its creator, which is why we get from bad to worst over in Stars Hollow.

From the perspective of the current seventh season of  ""Gilmore Girls"" where the show has continued to decline it is now impossible not to look at the departure of creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, not to mention Daniel Palladino, as the major factor in the show's deterioration.  In fact, I now look at the final scene of the sixth season as a deliberate attempt by Sherman-Palladino to derail the show as she walked out the door.  Certainly the writers left behind have taken the implications of where Lorelia ends up and what she has just done and driven the show into the ground to the point where I would prefer it if this was the last season (current rumors are the CW wants an eighth season but Alexis Bledel is leaning towards no and Lauren Graham will not do the show without Bledel even if that is what the network wants).  Clearly the writers left behind cannot deal with the Gilmore girls in happy relationships, which is why the show has descended into the murky abyss of a soap opera instead of being the witty and wonderful series it had been before it jumped the shark.",1164067200,2,5501,4.521651560926485
2598834,1,B000G1R4SY,"The Gilmore Girls had such a close relationship that I thought a season full of tears would show how women can connect emotionally.  It wasn't.

Both characters lacked the characteristics all women admired in them: strong personalities, confidence, a sense of humor, and emotion-filled.  The whole Dean affair lowered my opinion of ""Rory"" and it was not redeemed.  Instead she drops her dream and decides to ""find herself"" which involved becoming part of upper class society and staying with a man who pulled a Ross ""we were on a break"" move.  She was a little Emily in the making.  It just fit the cliche of Logan's father and mother which she hates.  Lorelei and Luke didn't click on screen and she didn't open her mouth once to admit she was unhappy.

Characters can change and grow but the main personality characteristics need to remain some level of consistency.  Hoping for a better season 7!~",1163376000,9,900,4.792207792207792

Other than a short trailer for the new season there are special features ... ABSOLUTELY NONE!!!

This is such a step-back to old times that I could not even believe it at first. I mean ... all shows offer some bonus materials these days, be it featurettes, music videos, photo galleries, interviews, commentaries, or whatever else!!

I just think that is absolutely inacceptable to release a dvd set of such a popular tv show with no bonus materials whatsoever.

All the previous seasons had english subtitles.

About the stories in season 6: They truly rock! Rory is really growing up and the romance between Luke and Lorelai is cuter then ever! Amy Sherman Paladino is a true master of the comedy.

The regular TV captions take up too much space on the screen so it can be hard to see what is happening on the episode.

You have to take one out to put back the other all while balancing them both, and hoping you don't scratch them.  The only ""extra"" that they had was a glimpse of the new shows on CW, and a glimpse of the some of the new DVD seasons coming out.

At the end of Season 3, she pops up as Sasha, the earth-mother, hippie who is living with Jess' estranged dad in California - a strong, intelligent, caring woman with a quirky, super-smart, young daughter. And she's great, as is her daughter, and you're left wondering why you never get to see these great characters again, until Jess gets the old heave ho, and it becomes clear.

In Season 6, up pops Anna, the strong, intelligent, caring woman who has managed to have a child by Luke without his knowledge, despite living in a neighbouring town (as has been pointed out in another review). And what do you know, this daughter is also quirky and super-smart, like the last one, although without the propensity for hiding inside/under furniture. Ok, so this time Sherilyn's brunette not blonde, but hello people! Way to underline how little you care about the audience & just how long you think their attention span lasts.

And no, this was in no way similar to the way that Sean Gunn was written into the series as Kirk after his playful rendition of Mick, the cable guy in Episode 2 of Season 1.",1162080000,5,1346,4.623430962343096

I saw season six on TV and knew what I was getting into when I purchased this set (I even pre-ordered it).  I have no criticism for the episodes/season itself, but I don't like how they changed this box set from the previous ones.  For example, the way the DVDs are in the case.  They overlap, so you have to take the one on top (disc 2) out to get to the one on bottom (disc 1) which makes for unnecessary juggling.  Also, and my biggest complaint, NO EXTRAS!! This box set has no special features, deleted scenes, Gilmoreisms, etc.  Since i have already seen the episodes, this was one of my favorite things the box set offered.  I was sad to see they had done away with it.

If I was just reviewing the show, I would have given it 5-stars, hands down, but because I was disappointed with the set up of the box set, I had to give it 3-stars.",1161302400,4,1004,4.1179487179487175

Im from Australia and we are always the last to get any tv series. The 6th season of Gilmor Girls has not even aired down under yet so I am in love with Amazon for giving me the opportunity to buy this DVD to ease the GG cravings.

My beloved package arrived early on a Wednesday morning. I quickly called in sick to work so I could staRt watching immediatly. I was a little apprehensive as most of the reviews I read following up to this great day were quite negative.

But as I kept watching I was thoroughly surprised as it was still typical GG.

Rori was great, a lot more mature - I love logan, they mesh well together and I think with Rori's help he will be a great part of her life. Im glad Dean is no where to be found I always found him to be really boring and a bit weak. Paris is always fun to watch! and Richard and Emily always live up to form.

Lorelei and Luke relationship was not what I expected, it seemed to be a lot of hard work on both parts. The arrival of his daughter was a bit far fetched but she is here and I cant wait to see what is to come.

2598859,5,B000G1R4SY,"This is the most heartbreaking and difficult Gilmore Girls season to watch to date. The last ep. of Season Five set up the season to begin with Rory dropping out of Yale and moving in with her grandparents both moves a big slap in the face to her mother Lorelei and Lorelei's proposal to Luke. We were left all summer long wondering what would happen. Every ep. of Season Six was a must see t.v. and yet the end of each ep. I was left disappointed and drained. The split between Lorelei and Rory was difficult to watch and it dragged out far to long I think Lorelei should have at least tried to get Rory to listen to reason. I don't know if it was the writing or what but I found it very difficult to feel any sympathy for Rory during the split. It just seemed to come off as another rich spoiled brat then a girl who lost her direction. The writers have been pointing Rory into the richie rich world since season five to create conflict but for me its making it harder to care about Rory. I was happy wehn she finally realized the uselessness of her life and went back to her mother. I liked how Richard and Emily were taking the oppuntunty as a chance to fix the mistakes they made with Lorelei. Rory's always had a good relationship with her grandparents and rarely any of the problems Lorelei has until she experienced living with them. I was happy to see this. But I still feel Rory owes Richard and Emily an apology for the way she left no matter how difficult Richard and Emily are she made the choice to live with them. Their reunion was welcomed but I think Rory owed her mother an apology.

  Asside from her estrangement from Rory, Luke says yes to Lorelei's proposal without hesitation and plans their wedding. They remodel her house and she adopts a dog. But the wedding plans come to a halt when Luke learns he's a dad. I like many fans was skeptical of the long lost daughter angle. But the actress playing April is great and I really loved the new charactor. I liked April and Luke's relationship. What I didn't like was Luke's hiding the information from Lorelei after their argument about honesty and have Lorelei find out on accident. Its understandable for Luke to be thrown for a loop at learning has a kid and how to handle suddenly being a dad to an eleven year old but it was out of charactor for Luke to keep it from Lorelei and then procede to exclude Lorelei his daughter. I also can't see Lorelei not calling Luke on this instead we got a very sad Lorelei and no wedding.

  Rory and Logan's relationship contiuned to go up and down. I can't stand Logan and had hoped they would break up for good. All his drinking, partying, stupid friends and pranks. I hate the nickname ""ace"". His whining about how he's life's going to be over when June comes. I don't like the person Rory is when she's with him or forgiving him for being a jerk or cheating on her with half of a bridal party. I really thought this was going to end up being more about Rory's relationship with Christopher. The scene when Logan and Christopher are exchanging stories  about schools they were being kicked out of I thought this was it Rory was finally going to realize it but I was diappointed.

  I liked the evolution of Lane and Zach's relationship they became a welcome relief from all the sad and disappointing storylines. From Hep Alien's tour, to their breakup and to their two beautiful weddings. Lane and Mrs. Kim's relationship has become so wonderful. I love how Mrs. Kim supports Lane's decisions while keeping true to her own beliefs the same goes for Lane.  I loved Paris from her lunches with Lorelei, crappy and scary apartment, the way she ran the Yale Daily news like a dictator and when she became broke. Sookie and Jackson were great as always and so was Michel. I loved the big Gilmore fight in Friday Nights Alright for Fighting and the scarying insurence stories Richard told Luke and Lorelei in You've Been Gilmored.

Prior to watching every new dvd collection, I go through and watch the previous seasons so I can be up to date and ready for the new release.  With a fresh perspective of where the Gilmore Girls has been in the past coupled with the fresh viewing of this new release, it is very easy to compare and contrast the huge differences between the series up through season 5 with the newest release of Season 6.

On a positive note: The plot has never been more wicked.  Not only are there happy fuzzy moments that everyone incredibly enjoys, but there are also offbeat moments that are expected of characters that should symbolize real human beings.  The eb and flo of content is incredible and consistant in its own right with previous releases.

The continuation of the plot from the previous series makes fans ache in longing for the return to normalcy between the two estranged charachters Loralai and Rory, but it takes some time for them to come together.  But beyond the storyline, you could tell that the directors were just not ""in it"" as much as they had the previous 5 seasons.

The entire season 6 had a ""lacking"".  The music wasn't as on-beat with the plotline and the camera work was completely off the mark.  The story-line wasn't really the issue and could be left alone, but with the dynamic camera changes, lack of background music forethought, and uncomplete color ""mood"", it loses its crisp ""Gilmore"" uniqueness.

The music that was actually in the different scenes seemed to have less care put in, and instead just seemed like a sudden, ""Oh yeah, that's right.  There should be some music here.  What track should we play?  Hey Joe!  Spin the roulette table!"".  Previous shows have trademark seeming music specifically when Lorelai and/or Rory are up to something, when a scheme is taking place, when they're investigating or looking into an oddity (as they so often are doing) and even Kirk has a little music bit or two that typically plays when he's in a scene.  Either the music was on roulette randomness, or it was completely dead silent!  A pin dropping could have been heard in some of the scenes, the sound was so stark.

The camera angles have been completely off as well.  It seems almost like someone who is either unseasoned or used to amateur shots is in charge of the camera work.  I would have to give him/her props for the interesting use on the ""Friday Night's Alright for Fighting"" where the camera zips back and forth, but it was incredibly unclean and wobbly as though the tripod had broken and they couldn't afford to get a new one, so they decided to do it all by hand.  Very creative, but also very distracting.  It was so distracting that it took me right out of the plot and I missed a lot of what was said as I entrancingly observed the ""whoosh"" of the camera.  A suggestion?  Good clean picture-book flips back and forth between character close-ups, or the ever-present and beloved ambient scenes that have been so incredibly persistent in the previous 5 seasons where the camera is set up and shows the entire room or 2 sets of characters at a time.

The typical feel of the different scenes was white-washed with the lack of added color tone.  Most good video results include ambient mood tones.  Taking Firefly as a classic good example, the kitchen areas always used yellow, the engine room used red, and so on and so forth, Gilmore Girls has always had a certain tone to it that was missing in the 6th Season.  It was as though the show was done in a rush and the care taken to details was just entirely missed in the hustle and bustle.

The storyline itself didn't necessarily have any issues.  It was what kept me watching, but with these other distractions, the season just seemed entirely flat and unfinished.  The entire series had the feeling of a rough draft and had none of the polish that a finished product should.  The DVD collection had absolutely no extras either, which leads me to believe that there was a time-crunch and they just didn't have the time to give the show the polish that it needed, or maybe they just didn't take the time to give it polish.  It is still worth purchasing the collection, but don't expect it to be as awesome as the previous 5 seasons.",1159747200,6,4378,4.554987212276215

2598878,2,B000G1R4SY,"The general consensus is that the sixth season of the WB's critically acclaimed Gilmore Girls drama was less-than-stellar. Chintzy plot devices, ludicrous behavior by the much-loved Rory Gilmore...

The DVD box set is no different.

One of the best things about buying a television show on DVD is the special features. This box set contains no - and I mean NO - special features. It is packaged with a promotional DVD for the shows Warner Bros. produces, including Gilmore Girls, but also less family-friendly shows, such as FX's Nip/Tuck.

The sixth DVD in the set, typically loaded with sometimes-lame features (but features nonetheless), contains nothing except the final two episodes of the season and a CW ""trailer"", which is nothing more than clips from the sixth season with a voice-over about the rave reviews bestowed upon the show.

To top it off, the DVDs themselves are packaged in a difficult-to-use fold-out box, with two DVDs layered over each other. Not the brightest design.

I'm disappointed. Gilmore Girls was the first really great show I saw on television since Frasier, and it seems for all the world to me that the producers have thrown out many of the original values and goals they claimed to uphold.

For those like me, who don't want a gaping hole in their collection of Gilmore Girls seasons, this is a must. But it's definitely the most disappointing release of a TV show on DVD that I, personally, have ever come across - and there have been many.

As always, Amazon went above and beyond the call of duty. We preordered this box set, and it arrived long before the estimated delivery date. That's just about the only bright spot in this particular purchase.",1158883200,17,1688,4.840277777777778

Everyone was so out of character it became painful to watch. I'm all for soaps, but Gilmore Girls turned into a BAD one during season 6. As a result, this will be the only season I won't be buying. And from some of the reviews, looks like I am not missing anything since there are no extras.  There were a few good episodes, but not enough to get me to buy this. I sure hope season 7, with its new executive producer, rights the wrongs from season 6! The fans deserve at least that much.",1158883200,9,655,4.077519379844961

The mother-daughter girls fight was well needed no one can be that close and never have a big fight. I think they handled it very well it also made the reunion much better.

The show has the same funny lines, the same great cast and perhaps most importantly the same important life lessons.

We all continually strive for the betterment of our lives and I think this season brings to light the fact that just because things are wonderful or perfect (Rory's life) it doesn't mean they cannot go horribly wrong in an instant.  While it's frustrating and disappointing, it adds a bit of reality to the otherwise pristine life of Rory Gilmore.  It could easily been argued that her life was to unrealistic.

Regardless of whether your a new fan or an old one, I highly recommend this series and season to you for viewing pleasure.  There are very few shows that my wife and I watch and this one is a mainstay.  We've bought all the DVD seasons so far and will continue as long as the series goes on.

2598892,4,B000G1R4SY,"The show...

What is it about the 6th season? It's like a sophomore slump or something. The 6th season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was it's worst season ever. However, you did find your amazing episodes like ""Once More With Feeling"" and ""Tabula Rasa"". The 6th season of Gilmore Girls continues with this tradition. The 6th season is by far it's worst. With that said, even when it's at it's worst, just like Buffy, it's still better than almost anything else out there. So, naturally, I still picked up this season. It's still a good watch, even if it's main characters have drifted from what makes them the Gilmore Girls. I certainly don't like seeing Lorelai or Rory sacrifice themselves for the love, or lack of same. Yet, in life, this sometimes happens. I know I've been guilty of this in my own life. So, why should fictional characters be any different. Love makes you do the wacky. Just forgive the girls and watch one of the best shows on the air. I mean, it could be worse, they could be finding dead bodies and solving murders, talking to ghosts or eating bugs. I think we have it fairly good.

The DVDs...

What the heck!? No extras? To me, that just seems like a slap in the face. It was obviously a rush job. As for the packaging, I really loved the ""book"" style used before. I also like the new DVD housing set-up they are using now. They use this style with the Veronica Mars DVDs (another one of the best shows on the air). So, I can't complain there. The lack of extras is what really threw me. I just find it hard to believe they couldn't even give us a crummy ""Gilmore Goodies and Gossip"" episode. C'mon! Are they even trying? Also, what ever happened to those Gilmore Girls guide books they used to throw in to help the simple-minded with all of their obscure references. Those haven't been seen since the 4th season. The 5th season just included a little card that told us to look online for the guide. In the 6th season, we didn't even get that. It just seems like a lack of respect for the fans.

2598895,4,B000G1R4SY,"Season six of the critically acclaimed series had fans of the show split down the middle just like with season 4, although maybe less strongly. The reason?. Well, there's a couple. We'll get to that in a minute. Season six is a fine season for the series, but it hits some minor bumps along the way. It picks up right where season 5 left off, with Lorelai getting the call that Rory is in jail for taking out a yacht with Logan. ""New And Improved Lorelai"" is the season premiere, and it's a good one. The mother and daughter are on the outs, and Rory gets sentenced for her crime. The consequences for the crime are played out over the next few episodes. ""We've Got Magic To Do"", is a solid episode that will have you cheering for Richard and Emily, and Mitchum Huntzberger and his wife getting theirs. Richard comes to his senses about their arrangement with Rory in ""Welcome To The Dollhouse"", which includes a sweet gesture by Richard with the aforementioned dollhouse. Jess rears his head again in ""Let Me Hear Your Balalaikas Ring Out"", which has him speaking some sense into Rory over all of the recent drama. Mother and daughter are finally reunited in the fantastic ep, ""The Prodigal Daughter Returns"". The second half of the season has some great eps and moments, but it's the twist that divided the fans. Luke learns he is a dad, and the following revelation puts a damper on Luke and Lorelai's relationship. A lot of people hated this turn of events and April, but I love the character. She fits in with the GG lingo, and the actress is phenomenal in the role. But poor Lorelai. What will this mean in the long run between her and Luke?. What's a drama without conflict?. People also had a problem with the ongoing seperation between Lorelai and Rory during the first part of the season. While it wasn't always feel good, I liked it because it showed more conflict(there's that word again)in their relationship when things have always been pretty rosy. Other notable eps here include the Thanksgiving episode, ""He's Slippin 'Em Bread...Dig?"", ""The Real Paul Anka"", and ""I Get A Sidekick Out Of You"". The season finale, ""Partings"", sets up some interesting things, but I was not satisfied with it as I was with past season finales. Season six also includes a wedding(you'll find out who), and other goodies. Some story choices weren't the best, and the mother/daughter seperation, even tho I liked them trying something different, just felt wrong. For any of the flaws that season six has, they have just as many, if not more, great moments that totally make up for it. The writing is still top notch, and the cast is still one of TV's best ensembles. Season 7 starts on the new CW Network, and I hope everyone finds it.",1157760000,15,2730,4.6193415637860085
2598896,3,B000G1R4SY,"Like most of the people who have submitted their review, I love this show.

BUT, in regards to this particular season, I was let down.  Not for the same reasons as most of these reviewers (the drift between the girls, Luke's daughter, etc.) but because of the lack of the supporting cast throughout the entire season.

One of the things I love most about Gilmore Girls is that EVERY character on this show is quirky in their own way: Lane, Luke, Babette, Kirk, Miss Patty, etc...and these fantastic characters where practically non-existent throughout the entire season.  In fact one reviewer commented on how Lanes special episode was one of the best of the whole series...I couldn't agree more.  The episode was funny and heart-warming, just as this show has been from the beginning, but I loved it because everyone in Stars Hollow was present and that's when the show is at its best.

My only other issue with this season derives from the last 2 minutes of the season finale.  I love Lorelei because she is different, she is not afraid to speak her mind, she is not traditionally conservative...BUT she has strong values that were obviously very well instilled in her daughter.  I think she is a wonderful modern day example of how good a person can be, despite their lack of church instilled values.  And the final scene of that episode completely abolishes the character the writers had established for Lor...I'm intrigued to see how they will remedy that story, because the direction they took her character is an absolute shame.",1157500800,9,1535,4.806083650190114
2598897,2,B000G1R4SY,"When a show jumps the shark, that shows that is has gone downhill. An example of this can stem from Happy Days, when Fonzie jumped over a shark while water skiing. Thus Happy Days literally went down with that stunt (though some may say that Ted McGinley had something to do with the demise of Happy Days, or even Ron Howard's departure from the show).

Another example was in the last season of the Brady Bunch when Cousin Oliver (Robbie Rist) became a part of the cast. It showed that the kids were getting too old and the writers needed to get someone young to keep the viewers enthused.

I'm not a fan of Gilmore Girls (I'm more into Everybody Loves Raymond), but even I think that after season six this drama has fallen on hard times. But I think it jumped when Emily Gilmore stuck her nose in Lorelai and Luke's relationship. She had no business trying to meddle in Lorelai's lovelife. If Emily was anything like Marie Barone, she would accept Luke and Lorelai's relationship for what it was. Of course, the Barones wouldn't get along with the Gilmores anyways because they're too stuck up and Frank would drive everyone crazy at Friday night dinner with his penchant for sitting down with his pants unbuckled and saying Holy Crap at various intervals!

I'm not trying to knock this wonderful show, but it resembled Days of our Lives after Emily and Richard renewed their wedding vows. I just wish that I would have seen some blood between Luke and Christopher at the ceremony. That would have made it really interesting. He could have also knocked Raymond out cold. LOL!!!

2598898,4,B000G1R4SY,"Poeple need to calm down about how different season 6 is from the others. Stop making rash, false and ridiculous statements about how ""the show is dead"" and how you are no longer going to watch new or even previous episodes anymore. You aren't true GG fans. Get a clue.

I've been a fan from day 1, have seen every episode and can safely say I know this show inside out. People are comparing season 6 to the earlier seasons(1-3), where Lorelai and Rory were inseparable. The show has grown since then, as was always the intention. Compare it to seasons 4 and 5, which is the direction the show was always meant to take, as the premise of Rory going to college and moving away from home was set from the very beginning. After watching season 5(which is acclaimed by both fans and critics alike as the series best season),I can't see much difference in the show as it moves through season 6.  Yes, there's the Lorelai/Rory separation, but this is handled so very well and acted beautifully. Plus, it allows for episode 9(the fantastic episode in which Rory and Lorelai reunite-now my favourite episode ever) which is absolutely touching, and could not have taken place without the dramatic and suspensful episodes which preceeded it.

The core components of the show that made us fans are all still there, and just as strong as ever. Wit, one liners, eccentric characters, warmth, brilliant acting and drama. They have always mixed drama with comedy, and progressed the characters each season. Lorelai and Rory have fought before..and believe it or not 21 year old college students DO go through phases of uncertainty and disillusionment. Why are people so shocked with the so called dramatic twists of this season?

I watch this show to be entertained, drawn into the characters, be surprised and to laugh. Season 6 provides all of this. Re-watch the episodes people, you will find you have made an incorrect judgement.

The first 4 episodes are a little more sombre than the series as a whole, however episode 5 is where it picks up. The Lorelai/Rory separation storyline actually really starts to work here as Emily and Richard shine, and there are some very funny scenes with the ladies of the DAR, Paris, and of course who can forget Emily's legendary verbal attack on Mrs Huntzburger? These episodes were as real and funny as any of the previous seasons.

From Episode 9 onwards the show really steps it up. Paris as the editor of the Yale daily news, Rory starting work for a newspaper, Luke becoming a Dad-some of the best plotlines and funniest moments of the shows entire run. The episodes where Rory and Lorelai return to Friday night dinners and where Lane gets married are hands down some of the best episodes of the shows entire 6 season run. Episodes 10 and 11 of this season are pretty close behind and had some genuine laugh out loud moments.

And a season cliffhanger that seems out of character? Do you people not remember the season 4 ender with Rory and Dean? This show has never been afraid to push boundaries that may make the characters less likeable. Yes Luke is a little grumpy, but he has always been grumpy-that's his character. I still found him endearing, especially as the overprotective, kindof dorky Dad to April. And Lorelai has lost her mojo?? Never! Wrong, wrong, wrong people. She's as strong and defiant as ever, and the one liners and pop culture references continue to fly out of her mouth faster than any other character on t.v.

For those of you who haven't seen the 6th season yet and are worried it isn't as sharp, witty, funny and surprising as the other seasons..rest assured. After the first 4 episdoes, you will find yourself in familiar territory. Plus, the acting is the best it's ever been. Yes the situation with Lorelai running to Chris in the finale was dramatic and places her relationship with Luke in doubt. But lets face it-Luke and Lorelai have never had a smooth relationship and have only been together since the end of season 4. For me, I am VERY intrigued as to how this situation is handled, and am waiting eagerly for the commencement of season 7 to find out. Keeping your audience on it's toes and in suspense as opposed to predictability is what has always separated Gilmore Girls from the rest of the pack.

Seasons 5 and 6 were pretty much on par as the highest overall rating seasons of the Gilmore Girls thus far, and the dvd for season 6 is number 13 on the bestsellers list here, and hasn't even been released yet! Bad season huh?-you people need to stop microwaving with the door open.",1156809600,31,4557,4.665006226650062
2598899,5,B000G1R4SY,"Gilmore Girls is one of the best series to ever be on television.  It has succeeded to bring to life such realistic characters that have become real.  The show has always seemed more like real life when compared to other shows.  We have experienced the ups and downs, loves and losses of these people- Lorelai, Luke, Rory, Sookie, Emily, Richard- the list goes on.

Season 5 ended with what fans have been longing for-  the union of Lorelai and Luke as a couple.  Season 6 could have flowed a little better, but the writers took many chances here as they kept the show true to form- inventive, true to life and always bringing up the unexpected.

Let's be serious.  Many are upset that Luke and Lorelai didn't just continue walking into the splendors of love's bliss but these are real, complex characters and both bring much baggage.  Also, life just doesn't go complication free.

Lorelai, played by the rare and extremely gifted Lauren Graham, has always been extremely strong and fought thru thick and thin.  This season her world had many hits- Rory was out of her life for a long while and Luke, whether due to his introduced daughter or not, was very noncommital about the marriage.  She had put her heart on the line and she had too much.

Seeing these episodes in secondary viewing, I can't wait for the uninterrupted viewing on dvd.  Lorelai had an emotional breakdown this year.  It was just too much and her depression grew as the season progressed.  It should have been and Emmy for Lauren.

The show was true to life as it always has been.  Lorelai is human and can only take so much.  To just stick with Luke and Lorealai as a happy couple would have been unrealistic - it would have taken the show out of of its true form - continuous exploration of the shows complex characters.

I myself am not at all concerned with the departure of the shows main creative force and have much hope and anticipation for season 7.  Also, to all you Gilmore fans who say stop watching the show - if you loved the show so much you would forgive a season that was different in form from others.  All long running shows have had this.  Loyal fans will be back and never have lost their love for this innovative, creative work of art.

Compared to other tv, even a slightly off season is far superior.  The Gilmore Girls is tv at its best.",1156723200,17,2335,4.476303317535545
2598920,3,B000G1R4SY,"the season got off to a shaky. i did not like the on going feud between lorelai and rory. yes, people have their fights but this was way over played. i like rory and logan, breaking them up would be drama. he loves her. its okay to want to be better because of a person. rory is amazing a lot of guys would want to be better because of her. logan is growing up and so is rory lets not ask for more drama~

as for lorelai and luke. luke's character has changed he isn't as sweet as he use to  be. i don't like the story line with the daughter. i don't like that he keeps things from lorelai and didnt' want her involved in his life. i like christopher he has made his mistakes but he loves lorelai. he seems like he would do just about anything for her. there's nothing wrong with that. the season ended up being great. i just don't know how many times i can watch the first half. the show is so much better with lorelai and rory on the same team!!",1156464000,5,947,4.005291005291006
2598921,3,B000G1R4SY,"As season 6 went along, both Lorelai and Rory started acting completely out of character, and for no other apparent reason than a misguided atempt at ""creating drama"". The funny thing is that the writers kept saying they didn't want to resort to soap opera antics to spruce up the show, but that's exactly what they did. I can tell you, every other Mexican ""telenovela"" has a long-lost daughter in its logic-free plot...

At the end of season 5, and understanding that everything couldn't be wine and roses in the Lorelai-Luke relationship because it would be tedious, I thought that the ""drama"" between Luke and Lorelei was going to be the possible selling of the Inn and her starting to travel often - remember how even Dean had that conversation with Luke in which he told him that the Gilmore girls wanted more than just Stars Hollow, and that other plotline where a hotel magnate was courting Lorelai into selling the Inn and having her work for him as a consultant? They just threw that out the window and went with the oh-so-tired daughter plot. I found April incredibly annoying, like they wanted to make her into a mini-Lorelai, but please! And Luke's reaction! He had just told Lorelai they should be honest with each other, but even without that, why on Earth would he hide the information from Lorelai? It didn't make any sense, even with the lame explanation that he didn't want Lorelai in the picture because April would fall in love with Lorelai and forget about him.

Then Rory-always the rebel in that her intellectual level, her manner of dress and her general attitude didn't quite fit in with the rest of the students at Chilton and even during the first year at Yale. You need a very strong character to be ""different"", and suddenly this girl not only is thrown off by one comment from a guy who didn't even read a single of her articles, but she goes off with the ineffectual, charming, good-for-nothing rich boy? I'm willing to chalk this up to inexperience, youth, whatever, but I hope she'll get back on track. I'll say this about Logan: He's a reflection of Christopher, isn't he, so maybe that would explain Rory's fascination with him, very much like Lorelai's for Chris. I also got tired about Logan whining about his life being laid out for him by his family, while he didn't do a single thing to get out of that, on the contrary, he very happily spent daddy's money - ""Let's get a helicopter and fly to NY and stay at the Plaza"". Right.

But the worse, IMO, was Lorelai. This female character was the first one on TV that I didn't grow sick of - Ally McBeal, Carrie Bradshaw and others that had been initially presented as modern, independent career women, but who, in truth, were all about searching for a man in their lives for validation. Lorelai never did that, she was strong and independent and worked hard for herself and her kid, without ever compromising her ""self"" for a man. So I totally hated seeing her bending over backwards to Luke's whims. Her speech at the end was great, specially how she didn't allow Luke to turn things around by blaming her for seeking out April's mother. That was the Lorelai we've known for five and a half years and the Lorelai who deserves to finally find a guy who is deserving of *her*, but who will not in any way define she is.

Frankly, I don't know how the writers will fix that - I don't see how she could get back with Luke, it would be unbelievable. I know a lot of fans hated that she went to Christopher, to some extent he's not really the right guy for her because she needs someone who's at least as strong as she is (where's Mr. Medina when you need him??), but his learning curve has, at least, gone up and ahead, while Luke's, well, he's just staying there, static, if not going backwards. Lorelai probably got a glimpse of what was ahead of her in the ""A Vineyard Valentine"" episode, where Luke was just whining about everything and being a regular sour-puss.

I still give the 6th season three stars because the actors were just fantastic, specially Lauren Graham. I hope the DVD will have juicy extra features, too.",1156291200,16,4107,4.552097428958051
2598922,4,B000G1R4SY,"Many people do not like how Season 6 tinkered with the mother/daughter tightknit dynamic shared by the show's main characters, Lorelai and Rory.  Truly, this rift served more as a reality check and advanced the plot, while deepening understanding of core principles that have personified the show.  (For example, one of the show's main themes has been the poor relationship Lorelai shared(s) with her parents while growing up.  Seeing Rory in that environment not only advanced the stories for that season but let us get a peek into the life that Lorelai had in the Gilmore house, which deepens our understanding of the show's core. )  Another plot point that makes Season 6 less of a fan favorite is how strained the relationship between Luke/Lorelai was in the season finale.  Neither of these things diminishes the value or entertainment of Season 6.  It merely serves two gods this season in that it is as witty/entertaining as ever while advancing plots.  The show boldly took less fan friendly means to do this, nothing more.  I am quite sure that I will purchase this set and it will join my other GG Seasons in the cabinet.",1155686400,4,1131,4.793814432989691
2598923,3,B000G1R4SY,"I own every DVD box set of Gilmore Girls, and cannot say how many times I have watched Seasons 1-5. Season 6, however, is nothing compared to Seasons 1-5. It seems the writers have run out of ideas and are just grasping for whatever they can come up with and whatever will draw in ratings. In Season 6, we find out Luke has an illegitimate daughter. This seems more like something we would see on The OC or Everwood, but not Gilmore Girls. What's more is that the show has lost its spark, its quick wit and its comedy. Compared to the laugh out loud nature of the first five seasons, this season is lacking. I think the writers should have made this the last season and pulled out all the stops. Half the episodes in Season 6 are dull and nothing really happens. Hard to say if I will buy these DVDs or not...the price would definitely have to come down. Here's to a better 7th season...",1155600000,14,887,4.285714285714286

I know what it's like to be in a relationship with a guy that's not so good for me....basically, I totally related to season 6 (as well as all the other seasons)  My parents divorced when I was a baby, so it was always my mom and me...although, I do have to admit, that I didn't like the whole ""long lost daughter of Luke's"", but it happened, it's there, and we'll just have to wait until the fall to see how it all plays out.  i can't wait for season 6 to come out, because I will buy it!

2598925,2,B000G1R4SY,"Gilmore girls is by far my favorite show. I've been faithfully watching every week since the second season. However, the sixth season took a rocky turn. It's clear that the writers were at a loss for story lines - bringing in an illegitimate daughter for Luke? It's a bit unbelievable that he didn't know the woman had had been dating was pregnant, especially if she lived in the next town over!

I always felt the writers were able to present Stars Hollow as being quirky without being too cutesy. This season, though, it was clear that the writers tried to exploit the ""quirky"" idea and ended up falling flat. The residents of Stars Hollow are no longer lovable, they're just downright annoying.

I also don't like the attempt at trying to make Rory more of a mainstream college girl. Suddenly, she's hanging out with the obnoxious rich kids and dating one! (Notably the same type of people she disliked at Chilton) Part of the reason the show worked was that Rory was always mature and didn't quite fit in with her age group.

Even though I'm a huge fan (I strongly recommend seasons 1-5), it's clear that Gilmore Girls has run out of ideas. The writers should have quit while they were ahead.",1155513600,15,1196,4.605633802816901
2598926,1,B000G1R4SY,"I use to love watching this show in anticipation of what is going to happen, but I didn't enjoy watching season 6.  It was not believable, especially Luke's long lost daughter.  Luke wanted to marry Lorelai so bad, then all of a sudden he got cold, and she was trying to get him to marry her.  This season was more of a chore to watch than enjoyment.  I hope season 7 improves with the new writers, and they can turn this mess around.  Hope they get rid of Luke's daughter because that story line just doesn't fit.  Just because she says she's his daughter, they buy it???  Come on, wouldn't you do your own DNA test??  Who would believe a child, no matter how smart she is suppose to be......  please!!!  Fix this show!!",1155340800,14,721,4.313432835820896
2598927,4,B000G1R4SY,"Season 6 Gilmore Girls has not been liked by most fans. I mostly agree that this has not been my most favorite season but, still was very good compared to other T.V. shows out there you have to admit. The most memorable parts of the season for me were when Jess finally came back (although not for very long only two episodes) He had finally turned his life around. He wrote a book. He now owns a book store thing. And a total role reversal he gave Rory advice. Which, unfortanately she didn't take. She is still with Logan even though he cheated on her. I have always thought Jess an interesting character. I knew that he and Rory probably wouldn't end up together because, of so many people hating how he treated her at the beginning. But, I have to say that in my opinion I would rather see Rory with Jess then with Logan. Or if it can't be Jess who has totally changed his life around then I think it should be somebody new. Many fans talk about Dean and how good Dean is to Rory. Well, he cheated on his wife with Rory. That's not fair to Rory and especially not fair to his wife. Rory is now back in college at Yale as we all knew she would be. So, hopefully things will work out with her Journalism career.

I must say I was very disapointed with what the writers did with the Lorelai and Luke as a couple. The writers changed everything when they came up with the idea that Luke now has a child that he didn't know about. Which, was mostly a good idea and it could have worked well. But, what reason would he not want Lorelai to have any part of his daughters life? I just didn't buy that. And then Lorelai suddenly quits being paitent and goes and messes up big time by sleeping with Christopher. Everybody knew from the very first episode of Gilmore Girls. That Lorelai and Luke were meant to be together. And they kept us on our toes until Season 5 when it finally happened. And now they are destroying it. Every T.V. couple has to have break-ups and problems before they are finally together. So, hopefully this is one of them and we can all hope that Lorelai and Luke end up together not Christopher.",1154736000,14,2113,4.26932668329177
2598928,5,B000G1R4SY,"Ok, for those of you who think that the 6th season was bad then how can you call yourself true Gilmore Fans? There's going to be drama in any television show. We couldn't just sit and watch Rory and Lorelai together all the time.  They've got to grow up and have their own lives at some point.  I absolutely loved this season, if you were a 21 year old going to college and living on your own, you'd live right along side them because life is that dramatic. Just because the writer's do something different, doesn't mean it's a bad thing.  This season was about love, plain and simple and the season to come will see how much Rory and Logan mean to eachother now that they're really apart.",1154649600,7,689,4.325581395348837

I expect to see satanic twin sisters and infants that leave for college three weeks after birth. It seems that the writers have lost sight of the fact that the show was about CHARACTERS and they have reached for every cheap parlor trick they can think of. What passes for PLOT these days makes me ill. I liked the show because it was INTELLIGENT. WAS. The plots are pathetic and the characters have all been betrayed for the sake of these DREADFUL storylines. Lorilei has become an idiot. Rory is a creature whose soul is beyond salvation. Luke is a wet rag. Only Kirk and Taylor survive. I quit watching before this season ended. I own every other season (season five was purchased with the belief that the show would RECOVER.) I have lost that faith. Veronica Mars, anyone?",1154131200,25,943,4.488372093023256

I loved every single episode of the first 5 seasons and I am dying to see how thay handle the problems that we saw in the 5th season finale. I can understand their out-of-character movements because college can change a person. And for the first time Lorelai is seriously getting married. She chickened out with Max but now she has to change, and actually be out of character, to get married. I am looking forward to see these 22 episodes but September 19 just seems too far away...Unfortunately.",1154131200,15,630,4.439655172413793

In seasons 1-5  i couldn't get away from it...but in season 6 i was sadly disapointed one of the reasons i loved Rory so much was because of her good attitude and abilty to be a hard worker and to cope with problems. Sadly some of the plot twists in this season were almost difficult to watch. The real Rory would have known that Logan was a jerk and drooped him faster than you can say ""sorry,you loser"" and i no it would be nieve to portray Rory as the PERFECT college gril .Rartying in that kind of enviorment is bound to happen but some of the stuff i sat through was heart-wrenching. There was alot less witty remarks and alot more drama. they did a good job of keeping Lorelai the same though some stuff she did was a little extreme for her. ALL i Can say is that the hope is still alive for the great show. I hope season 7 is great and restores Gilmore Girls to its true greatness",1154044800,11,956,4.134408602150538
2598942,4,B000G1R4SY,"Compared to previous seasons of Gilmore Girls, there were too many distractions from each plot.  The characters tended to meet new people and new challenges too often, and didn't get enough time to solve the existing ones.  April and the rift between Rory and Logan at Thanksgiving are just two of many dramatic events happening in the sixth season that took away the attention from the romantic plots and the relationship between Lorelai and Rory.

2598944,5,B000G1R4SY,"For sure, it seems that season 6 has brought the most problems, or plainly consequences for Rory and Lorelei. Sure the Independence Inn burnt down in season 4, Rory had to witness Dean's marriage to Lindsey (I despise her) and such, yet, now they face problems between each other. Rory is living at her grandparents, surely gagging Lorelei as all of her existence lives on separating herself from her mother, yet she does not want Rory to let go on her dreams of becoming a successful individual, I guess like her, just in a different method. Finally some action for Lane, although it seemed unlikely at first if you rewatch season 3 her love interest hits on Lorelei. Haha, did anyone else think it was funny that Dave went off to college in California, then he appears on the OC? hmmm...it would be quite interesting if they brought him back for a guest spot. Now that I think about it, it seems everyone's love life is booming, even Kirks and Paris. The Dragonfly Inn brings in new memories and new surprises. Rory becoming editor ....controversy, not really, there. Yep, it's a good season, although I am not happy with the ending, I think any true Gilmore Girls fan wants a certain two people to end up together, yet with the incredible writing, witty comebacks and fast dialogue, Gilmore Girls is always a 5 star show, and yes, the emmy's are stupid for ignoring it.",1153094400,6,1372,4.627049180327869
2598945,5,B000G1R4SY,"Lorelai Gilmore, as played by the wonderful Lauren Graham, is usually the merriest of characters, a wellspring of fun and laughter.  However, in this sixth season of ""Gilmore Girls"" she is forced to cope with levels of disappointment and heartache unprecedented in the show's history.  The first half of the season Lorelai is estranged from her usually ""freakishly close"" daughter, Rory (angelic Alexis Bledel); and in the second half she watches in anguish as her fiance and soulmate Luke (Scott Patterson) slips away from her.

Some fans of the series were upset by the Lorelai's rift (including reportedly Graham herself) but I thought it was a daring move by the writers.  Rory has always been a little too good to be entirely believable, and it was interesting to watch Bledel's fine work at displaying Rory's bafflement in screwing up her life.  Graham also shone as she showed Lorelai's stoicism and trademark mental toughness as well as the grief lurking underneath.  When the reconciliation finally came it was a classic Gilmore moment.

The revelation of Luke's long-lost daughter was derided by many as a ""Cousin Oliver"" moment, and I had problems myself with the haphazard plot mechanics.  But the emotional content of the storyline rang true.  Scott Patterson was touching as a man clearly in over his head, and once again Graham was heartrending as Lorelai desperately tried to hang on.  This season the many, many laughs were balanced by a lot of tears and some viewers didn't like it.  But if you view this season as part of the journey and not the final destination I think you will get a better perspective.  We all await with some trepidation a new season without the Palladinos, but given the set-up of this eventful sixth season the next could be fascinating.",1152748800,84,1780,4.916387959866221
