7685196,5,B01CO70L2S,"Such a good show with compelling characters! Apparently the first two seasons that aired in France were shorter seasons, condensed into ""Season One"" for the English subtitled DVDs. There will be one more season after this one, ""Season 6"" on DVD but airing in 2016 as season 7 on French tv.  I love this series. Some of the storyline for this Season 5 bugged me because I'd become invested in the characters, and some of the subtitles seemed dumbed down from the actual dialogue, but overall the series continues to be incredibly enjoyable. I want to see how they'll end things in the final season. Hope it isn't too long to wait for that DVD release!",1467417600,11,650,4.603448275862069

7685198,5,B01CO70L2S,"Once again I'm proud to be the first to post a review here and commend this fantastic series. Despite 5 seasons' worth of episodes the quality remains high, the drama intense, the acting superb, the realism----well, very real, and the plot twists and turns unpredictable, engrossing and fully believable. This series is so superb that I'm going to buy the 6th season in the French-only language release, even though my French isn't that strong, and hope that enabling the French-language subtitles, and having a French-English dictionary handy, will enable me to absorb the 6th season, because frankly I don't want to wait for them to release it with English subtitles!

A series to recommend heartily and unreservedly to anyone who is interested in history, and indeed to anyone who is interested in human drama.",1465862400,13,813,5.067164179104478

7685201,5,B01CO70L2S,"Sacre bleu! Incroyable! Season 5 is everything Season 4 wasn't. There seems to also be higher production values and superior camera work (i.e., far better angles and closeups without telegraphing what's happening next). Now you would have thought the war winding down to its conclusion would see the series peter out but I'd argue the chaos of those last days of German occupation are the most spine tingling of the entire five seasons. Episode 3 of this season really is right up there with the best TV has to offer today.

There are some super shockers involving major characters so make sure you don't watch this season on a queasy stomach. I also felt the guy playing Antoine, the young Resistance leader, stepped up his acting game a ton in this season.

Sadly, no extras on the DVD and another weird one is the DVD jacket cover. I did not recognize a single person in the pic and thought that a whole slew of new characters would be the focus of the season. They aren't. The scene depicted on the cover is one from the very last episode of Season 5. Strange way to market ""A French Village"" DVD, I'd say, even to those of us who've come this far.

Oh, yeah, not giving too much away but let's just say we learn that Mr. Schwartz enjoys ladies' backsides.",1494633600,,1260,4.493449781659389

7685208,5,B01CO70L2S,"The fifth season of A French Village is about a historic event that even those that consider themselves well versed in WWII may know very little about: the German retreat from France. When De Gaulle marched in the Champs-Elysees, there is a perception that he was the chosen leader of a unified country. In reality, France was a power vacuum that resembled anarchism and De Gaulle had to impose himself, struggling with the different factions within the Resistance. As for the Americans, they were the liberators but also a curse to be avoided.

Thats what the fifth season is about. Unlike the Americans, the French rarely make movies about their own history. When someone thinks about French movies, it is usually an existentialist drama or a light hearted comedy. A French Village is a breakthrough. Not only they covered the life of France during the war, but they did it exquisitely.

The writing is outstanding. Every word has a purpose. All actors made the characters real. This is one of the best TV shows ever.  .

The French village resembles the Asterix village, but without the magic potion. It is a macrocosm and microcosm of France. It is a melange of cultures and.stereotypes. Nordic vs Mediterranean; Capitalism vs Communism; Latin vs Saxon; temperamental vs reticent; chauvinistic vs indulgent. These are not just different attributes between people, but also within the individuals. My favorite character is Jean Marchetti. He saves lives that was not supposed to save and kills people for no major reason. Of course he is a villain, But in A French Village nobody is totally good and nobody is totally bad. The human soul is quite hazy.",1482364800,2,1655,4.921146953405018

7685223,5,B01CO70L2S,"If you're a devotee of the French Resistance movement, you will want to own a copy of this series.  It's very well done, and by all accounts and what I know of the French Resistance, a pretty true-to-life account of the day- to- day struggles faced by the Free French and the Communists as they struggled together to defeat the ""Boche"".  It was not a simple struggle - each having its own agenda and each dealing with collaboration, black market, Jews in hiding, just to name a few.  I could go on and on about the merits of this series, possibly the best out there dealing with this topic, but you should really see for yourself.  My review does not give it justice.",1470787200,7,667,4.3983739837398375

7685227,5,B01CO70L2S,"Villages in France are finally being liberated as we move into 1944. Characters we love start to return-one of my favorites is Msr Beriot. But as Villeneuve is liberated, chaos ensues. Without the police in proper force, looting, riots and theft threaten to overrun the town. Some resistance leaders step up to take charge, but paranoia exists. Who collaborated with the Germans and what should happen to them? And collaboration is such a loose term. They want to accuse Dr Larcher who was truely fulfilling his oath to do no harm-he's treated German and French patients and is often the voice of reason in this show. Msr Beriot is becoming more prominent as the prefect and a version of Mayor-but politics keep getting in the way-giving him many difficult choices. I won't go into the plot more-there are several twists and turns, more than a few either leave you speechless or in tears. It's a testament to how well written the story is, and how well rounded the characters are. I have to admit I'm getting more and more disgusted with Suzanne-she switches loyalties and bed-fellows so often I can hardly keep up-and acts on whether or not she feels scorned-I find myself yelling shut up! at the TV and keep hoping someone will take her out-cruel I know but just watch the show and you'll see what I mean! In short-watch this show-it's worth every second. My only complaint is they stopped doing the little extra at the end where a historian discussed the true history of the time, and people who were there were interviewed-it added more believability to the show",1468281600,10,1566,4.73992673992674

8753543,5,B01CO70L2S,"I""m at the end of the 5th season and just as riveted as I was in the first. What makes this show astounding are the development of the characters, and the difficult choices they must make in extreme circumstances. All characters have moral dilemmas and are painted with great depth and subtlety. The story lines intersect wonderfully with many surprises. As with all series the key is how to maintain the narratives, while introducing new characters with whom we don't have the same committment to that we had with the original characters and their plot lines. It took me a while to get used to the resistance fighters and their absurd theater games, but slowly their gravity and purpose grew and they were integrated perfectly.
They are even able to humanize the wicked blonde German captain that Hortense is having an affair with, and Hortense herself is one of the most conflicted characters. What it shows brilliantly is how people survived in the most trying of times.",1530748800,,973,4.832335329341317

2014-16 / MHz Network / 621m (4 discs), 350m (3 discs) / $39.95 / NR
 The history of World War II in general and the occupation of France by Germany specifically continues as seen through the microcosm of the fictional village of Villaneuve, located near the border between the two countries. The Nazis are beginning to retreat by the beginning of the fifth season but determined to cause as much atrocity as they can during their exit. The departure has left those who collaborated to varying degrees scurrying to navigate their own egress across whatever borders remain open or forge new alliances. The members of the various resistance groups are either engaging in vigilante justice or coming to terms with being part of the political landscape  a far different proposition than combat. Season six commences with trials of the collaborators. Some of the worst of the lot get off easily while some of the most admirable come to unpleasant fates. No character, no matter how prominent, is safe from a sudden, sometimes violent, exit. A French Village is true to the realities of the time in portraying the era, both the brutalities of the Occupation and the sometime chaotic aftermath that rivaled the Reign if Terror (when two women are loaded into a cart and hauled off to meet mob justice the analogy is underlined).
I have not dwelt much on the enormous cast in this series in previous reviews because few, if any, are likely known to U.S. viewers, but the acting is astonishing. Whether its because of careful casting that placed them in roles that fit like the proverbial glove or sensitive direction or just because they are all so danged good I do not know. I suspect the last because the roles are so meaty and complex that middling performers could never do them justice. No one is completely pure or resolutely evil; a policeman known as the butcher will unexpectedly release resistance fighters while a seemingly mild-mannered schoolmaster will commit cold-blooded murder. The performances and the unexpected character developments will keep you glued to the screen unless you're hopelessly phobic about subtitles. The photography and the (sometimes eccentric) editing are also laudable. There is scrupulous attention to period detail in the props and furnishings and vintage clothing that isn't crisp from the dry cleaners or fresh from the costume shop. Everything about this series is splendid.",1512172800,,2482,5.016990291262136
