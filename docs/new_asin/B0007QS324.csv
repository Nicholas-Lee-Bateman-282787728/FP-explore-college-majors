2231764,4,B0007QS324,"what's not to like about four buddies livin large in hollywood? great dialogue, great casting, great music...and extremely hot babes to go with it all. they all bring a certain charm to their roles, but jeremy piven and kevin dillon are standouts. the episode with gary busey was pure genius...great show!",1117238400,5,305,5.0
2231765,4,B0007QS324,"...which is to say rich, sugary, not very nutritious but tasty and addictive as hell.  It's junk food, no doubt about it, but it's also so enjoyable it's pretty hard to begrudge.

Four friends live together and hang out around L.A.: Vince is a DiCaprio-level star on the rise (though he's reportedly loosely based on producer Mark Wahlberg); Eric is his best friend, a smart kid trying to help him manage his career; and Turtle and Johnny Drama (Vince's has-been older half-brother) are the comic relief.  Adding shards of garlic to the mix is Jeremy Piven as Ari, Vince's razor-tongued agent who, were he played by anybody other than Piven, would probably be too much to digest in such an otherwise tangy environment.

In stark contrast to most HBO Sunday night shows (""Sopranos,"" ""Six Feet Under,"" ""Deadwood,"" all of which usually leave me feeling devastated and so much the better for it) this is bummer-free TV.  The characters don't have to work, don't have to worry about money, have infinite free time and access to women and recreational misadventures.  Even in those rare moments when they have an actual problem it's never really a pressing problem (""Eric, which movie should I do???"").  And each episode seems to end with the main characters sharing a drink while watching the sun set from some beautiful vista.

And you know what?  Why not?  The show ain't exactly Tolstoy but it's a lot of shiny, colorful fun -- smart dialogue, sharp ""inside baseball"" industry jokes, attractive ladies, cool toys and an eclectic mix of hip-hop and classic rock.  It's like HBO fused the Y chromosome of ""Larry Sanders"" with the X chromosome of ""Sex and the City"" and came up with a precocious but charming little tyke.",1117152000,46,1716,4.822525597269625
2231766,5,B0007QS324,This show is truely awesome. The dialogue is amazing and suits every situation in the show perfectly. Kevin Dillon and Jeremy Piven are hilarious. You couldn't ask more from a supporting cast. The music is really good too. Anybody have any info on a soundtrack?,1116028800,3,261,4.822222222222222
2231767,5,B0007QS324,"If you've already seen the first season of Entourage, you'll be buying this set for sure.  If you haven't seen it, you really need to buy these DVD's.  The characters are engaging and the dialogue is hilarious.  Jeremy Piven is a stand-out as he absolutely chews up and spits out every scene in which he appears.  I hope that Season 2 is more than 8 episodes.",1114300800,5,359,4.393939393939394

2231786,3,B0007QS324,"A funny, day in the life sort of show focused on a group of childhood friends one of them tries to make it in Hollywood. It's not a show with a point, similar to Sopranos which was out in the same era.

2232112,3,B0007QS324,"This show is my guilty pleasure. As misogynistic, trite, and shallow as it is, it does have plenty of good jokes and keeps me laughing. But, ugh! The rampant misogyny. The women are there to be f****ed or feared and there is no in between. I'm guessing this is a reflection of how Hollywood really is, which makes me never, ever, ever want to spend another dime on it. This is a land where the characters say things like 'I thought we were going to get rid of our wives when they turned 45' and 'This is why I only hire women to blow me.' There is some humor to be had in the small irony that two of the 'entourage' pack - Turtle and Drama - can never seem to score, but of course they solely want women who are far out of their league. In one episode, Turtle, despite being a fat slob, is genuinely disgusted that he ends up with the overweight woman in a group hookup and simply refuses.

The movie star of the bunch, Vincent Chase, is pretty enough, but lacks the charisma and ambition that a real movie star needs. We never see him stressing over a character - or even studying lines! He floats through life with all of the magnetism of your average good-looking surfer dude. It's also odd, despite supposedly being a huge celebrity, is never mobbed by crowds or chased after by a pack of rabid, traffic-snarling paparazzi, nor ever has to deal with seedy, untrue gossip stories. And, except for the occasional joint, none of them do drugs.

Vincent's best friend cum manager, Eric, seems to do absolutely nothing to advance his friend's career, and it busts all credibility that Vincent would pay him to stick around.

The main thrust of the show is Vincent's super agent, Ari Gold, sort of a human Wiley E. Coyote, if Wiley was sexist, racist, homophobic, and generally a complete dirt bag. But there is nothing he wouldn't do for his client - every actor must dream of an agent like this. There seems to be some latent homosexuality in Ari's blatant worship of Vinnie Chase, but this, of course, is never explored.

Vinnie's older brother, Drama, is a washed up actor who is delusional about his own (lack of) success. But he's the only character allowed to show genuine vulnerability.

It would have been nice to see the characters break out of their stifling stereotypes and do something different - maybe Vinnie could date a smart woman his own age? Maybe Eric could actually outmaneuver Ari? Maybe Drama could take on a surprise Oscar-winning role? Alas, nothing like that ever happens.

Still, the show can be genuinely amusing.",1470700800,,2540,4.559210526315789

2232482,5,B0007QS324,"I recently saw the 2015 Entourage movie based on the HBO series, so I had to see how the series evolved.
I was amazed with how well written the series was, the rapid fire dialogue between the actors is fun to watch.
I really like the funny comebacks from Drama and Turtle as well as all the bantering between the main characters.

I still have to remind myself that these are actors, because the series seems real, like the actors really grew up together.
This is due to the great scripts and cast. I would love to see some of the out takes and deleted scenes because,
I am sure the cast had a great time making this series.
The scenes in season 2, between Ari and his new assistant Lloyd are outrageous, I wonder how many times
Jeremy Piven (Ari) apologized to Rex Lee (Lloyd) for the lines he had to deliver.
 Looking forward to the rest of this outrageously funny series.

I have read that a Entourage movie sequel might be in the works, I sure hope so.",1459209600,,956,4.3

2232503,1,B0007QS324,"You would think that the pilot of a TV program would be especially good and engaging. I forced my self to watch 20 minutes of the Pilot and decided I was wasting my life watching this junk. I bought the first season to watch Jeremy Piven, because he is so good in Mr. Selfridge. Apparently Ari is a peripheral character, so for most of the screen time, we have to watch and listen to these other ridiculous characters. I'm glad Piven found a good program (Seflridge) to showcase his talents. What was he doing in this garbage?",1458432000,,526,4.43298969072165

2232569,4,B0007QS324,"Basically very enjoyable from a voyeuristic point of view. The producer of this series is Mark Walburg and although he says it is NOT a glimpse into his early career in Hollywood, he did name a character after his friend ""Drama"". If the peak into Hollywood is based on anything factual, it provides an eye-opening experience into the machine that is entertainment.  Be warned, however, this is rated Mature Audiences for many reasons, including language, drug use, nudity and sexual situations.

I do hope that more of a story line develops, however, as 5 seasons of the same situations and parties will make the remaining episodes not watchable.",1456963200,,646,4.972222222222222

Kevin Dillon is hilarious with his sincere efforts that are mostly met by rejection!
Gotta love all the Guest Stars!
Jerry Ferrara is a delight to watch working his hustle with his constant ""wheeling & dealing""!
Who doesn't enjoy a few laughs watching a ""behind the scenes"" look at something that's a huge part of our culture, TV & Movies, that we're never likely to get to participate in during our lifetime!
Jeremy Priven is despicably likeable with his ""in your face"" ""take no prisoners"" grin & attitude!
Debi Mazar as ber-feisty Shauna, Rex Lee as the long-suffering Lloyd and Perrey Reeves as the ""eye for an eye"" exacting Mrs. Ari Gold complete the stellar ensemble for the neat Los Angeles parody TV Show..just sayin'!",1454198400,,923,4.961290322580645

2233018,5,B0007QS324,This whole series was awesome. When it was coming to an end in the 8th season I didn't want it to end. Every season is good because there is always some new obstacle they must over come and they always roll the dice and live on the edge financially but seem to always prevale. Jeremy Piven did a great job in all the seasons and was my favorite character. I couldn't get enough of this series. Hopefully one day they bring it back.,1446940800,,431,4.204819277108434

It is an Alice in wonderland glimpse at the inside of Hollywood elite.  Over the top, hard to believe, make believe and sometime true pathos.  It is thoroughly enjoyable and the characters are almost instantly likable though some take a while to understand.  Pure farce, yet close to Hollywood reality.

2233298,5,B0007QS324,"This is a lot of fun to watch.  It depicts the absolutely insane world surrounding Hollywood, but told from the inside, from the point of view of the movie producing world, actors, agents, major studios, etc., and in a way that makes you laugh, with great music, and with great characters.  I love the cameos by real movie stars, writers, and directors, both from today and the past.  Overall, I can't believe that I did not know about this series.  I've been watching episode after episode, and just when I think it can't get any crazier it does.  If you want to live vicariously through Vince, with his pretty boy looks and devil may care attitude, or E., as Vince's best friend and manager, Johnny Drama, with his anger issues and hoping that his acting career hasn't eclipsed, or Turtle, wanting to break into the music world but never too worried about anything, you can't go wrong.  Who wouldn't want to experience this kind of lifestyle, even if it was for only a little while?  I especially enjoy Ari, Vince's agent, with his foul mouth, neurotic ways, and ever more inventive ways to insult anyone and everyone around him, makes me crack up.  Funny thing is that as shallow as some of these people are, you begin to care for some of these characters.  You want Vince to get his movie deals, and for Johnny to finally get cast in some part.  Any part.  I am currently wrapping up season 3 and ready to binge on season 4.  Love this show.",1444867200,3,1445,4.494252873563219

2233398,4,B0007QS324,"Overall, Entourage is an entertaining show with lots of fluff.  If real life in Hollywood is like this, then they can keep it.  From this show, it can be inferred that life in Hollywood is completely devoid of substance...only appearance and attitude.  That's probably not too far from the truth.  Those comments are mainly about the writing of the script.  Otherwise, the show is well done and professionally produced. It ought to be with Exec Producers like Mark Wahlburg in the credits.  4 out of 5 stars because although there is a plot and storyline, it doesn't really teach a lesson or show consequences of the excesses that Hollywood produces.",1444262400,,650,4.863636363636363

2233466,4,B0007QS324,"Entourage offers a view into the world of Hollywood, and a very different reality it is.  The series tracks the escapades of four friends from New York, one of whom - Vince - is poised to become a major movie star; the others are accepted hangers-on to various degrees before they (in later years) find their own successes.  The entertainment business is shown with all its glories and warts, personified by a high-powered agent portrayed by Jeremy Piven with fervent abandon.  There are girls, and guys, aplenty; the series also features prominent actors and industry personalities in guest appearances (and occasionally just cameos) that give the series an air of reality.  But reality isn't the theme here - it's the fantasy world of Hollywood.  Overlook the convenient coincidences and climb aboard for a fun ride!",1444176000,,818,5.029629629629629

Jeremy Piven who plays agent Air Gold and Rex Lee who plays his assistant and work-wife Lloyd are the main reason this show is fun to watch. The main cast provides the context for their very complicated relationship.

The guest stars are legion and as quirky as you'd hope. The episodes run around the half-hour mark. Adrian Greiner is insipid but so pretty. The rest are entertaining.

Not a masterpiece but good fun.",1441497600,,541,4.806451612903226

I love all the characters, but Drama is my least favorite.  Watching it the second time around I realize just how much his character really bothers me.  He annoys me enough that I'm doing everything possible to continue watching it.  Thankfully most of his speaking parts are minimal, but in Season 6 where he takes a flying leap, not a simple jump, to the conclusion that Coakly (I think that's the correct spelling) is trying to get into Jamie's pants for no reason other than Coakly doesn't want Drama to join him and Jamie for lunch is ridiculous beyond belief.

If you say you do, then this show is for you; however, you might just wanna go look in the mirror at the empty-shell-of-a-life your existence has become.

There is a small dose of reality in the portrayal of a very lucky young man who finds some success in the Hollywood movie industry; it will stimulate (heheh he said stimulate) any young man's imagination as he transports himself into the lead role during his most fantastical daydream.

As an older gentleman, my only excuse for watching so many episodes is a curiosity as to whether the script will mature into a more socially significant structure. So far it hasn't ... but not everyone is looking for significant. Glitz and hot women can overcome a poor script in a heartbeat. I may soon move on to other fair.

It's the ultimate guy's fantasy. The young main character makes it big in Hollywood and he's on the ""A"" list and brings all his buddies from Queens to live w him. They can go anywhere they want, say whatever they want, do whatever they want, and have plenty of money. It's a crack up to see what these kids do w the money and status and the mistakes they make. And let us not forget the most important thing...not only do they have all the money and status but everybody loves them and sucks up to them.

2234976,4,B0007QS324,"This show is really fun to watch. The fictional story follows an individual and a few of his best friends as he tries to make it in Hollywood. Vincent Chase (played by Adrian Greiner) grew up in Queens but has now made himself into a movie star. His best friend, Eric (Kevin Connolly), is Vince's manager, another friend, Turtle (Jerry Ferrara), is his driver, and Vince's brother, Johnny Chase (Kevin Dillon), is another actor who just hasn't been as successful as Vince. Its a story of childhood friends becoming rich and going on an exciting adventure in LA. The boys spend a lot of time partying and hanging out, but Eric and Vince's agent, Ari Gold, keep pressure on Vince to keep thinking about his career and the next movie that he will film. It really is fun to watch and lets you step into the life of an actor for a little while.

The only complaint I personally have about this show is that it can move kind of slow. Sometimes whole seasons are dedicated to Vince getting on one movie. The slowness can get kind of dull at times but still fun to watch.",1438905600,,1063,4.423469387755102

To be honest, I'm mostly watching this because my brother insisted. He also said it'll take 3-4 seasons to really love it. It is funny at spots but I can't say I like a single character in the show. Hell, the only reason I can be entertained by Jeremy Piven, is that's his character in everything. I'll keep watching due to promising my brother...

I'm not going to use the typical, ""Sex In the City W/ Men"" description -- that's very inaccurate. This is more like SITC on drugs. It's trashy Hollywood, mixed with glamour and glitz. You will hate every single person on the screen (except may be Ari) at first and you will want to rate this show zero star. But once you get through first several ep, you will get it.

It was actually fun watching many of the events that the men were a part of as they navigate the professional and social scene of Hollywood.  I also liked how  the first episode highlighted how  the men can both joke with each other and still encourage each other at the same time.  I look forward to watching more and Im undecided whether to purchase each season as a separate dvd or buying the whole dvd set. The preview parts of the dvd are for such shows as the Ali G show and The Comeback starring Lisa Kudrow. The Special features of disc  two  include behind the scenes coverage of Entourage and the options to use audio commentary.  Mark Wahlberg is one of the men interviewed to explain how the concept of Entourage came into being. Disc One also has the special features of audio commentary. Walhberg explains that the actors used to embody entourage resemble the guys that were in his social group (Adrien Grenier, Kevin Connolly, Jeremy Priven, Jerry Ferrara, and Kevin Dillon).",1397865600,,1160,4.624390243902439

It revolves around a group of annoying, vapid, crude, silly individuals who waste their lives in Hollywood's superficial culture of glamor and excess.  Most of the group are gathered to leech off of the success of one B-level actor.  They are largely unlikable and aimless.

2235195,5,B0007QS324,"Entourage takes you inside the life of an up-coming Hollywood star. Vince Chase has a hit movie, a high-pressure agent, and three of his pals from the neighborhood where he grew up. He's about to get a whole lot more, all the trappings of Hollywood including: sexy women, expensive handouts, and so much more. What makes this show a hit is the unrelenting dialog which borders on potty humor but actually punches hard at the subject at hand, be it the relationships between the guys, the tension between Vince's agent and his pals, or the dynamics of the Hollywood scene. Each vignette in an episode is quick and dirty, grabbing hold of a single point and making it quick, so the viewer has to pay close attention or you'll miss the subtlety. Of course performances are excellent with Jeremy Piven standing out as ""Ari"", Vince's agent. Piven puts it all out there the way a pro can, and yet somehow rises above cliche to surprise the viewer in most every episode. Supporting cast members lend credibility and variance to each of the roles. I only wish this was a one-hour show. It ends too quickly and I think there is plenty of room to explore some of the situations a little more. Still, a great show. Worth every penny!

Entourage
Rome
Californication
Spartacus
Weeds
Sex and the City
The Tudors
True Blood
Big Love

My wife and I have found that we enjoy these series better than watching individual movies.  I believe that we also would rank them in the same order, so this is a male/female friendly review.  As with all MoonDonkey reviews, it goes without saying that this is gospel.

I've tried to do this without including spoilers.

#1 Entourage (5 stars)
How could anything else be #1?  Entourage follows the career of movie star Vincent Chase and his group of friends.  This is the gold standard by which all other series are measured.  Plus, Entourage has the best one-liners of any series.  Unfortunately, I cannot include them in this review due to their graphic nature.

#2 Rome (5 stars)
Rome follows the exploits of two Roman soldiers - Verenus (the smarts) and Pullo (the brute).  Very well done.  For a historical drama, the sets are very well designed and believable.  In Rome, the idea is that you see the Roman Empire through the eyes of two soldiers as they experience the ups and downs of life.  My wife and I enjoyed this one a lot.

#3 Californication (5 stars)
Frankly, I wasn't sure I wanted to watch this at first.  I pegged David Duchovny as an X-Files guy and wasn't sure what to make of him in this role.  Also, I wasn't sure what Californication was about anyway.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  In Californication, we follow the life and career of author Frank Moody - a chaotic and perhaps self-destructive individual who has a way with women.  Unfortunately for him, he is trying to balance the chaos of his life on one side with his teenage daughter and her mother (his love interest) on the other side.  The dude is a train-wreck and it makes for a great series.

#4 Spartacus (4 stars)
Spartacus is about a man who is captured and made a gladiator slave in the Roman Empire.  There is just of a bit of a drop off from the 5 star series to 4 star Spartacus.  Why?  Well, there just isn't as much of Spartacus.  Basically one season followed by a ""prequel"" season.  I believe that is because the original Spartacus actor died of cancer.  I'm not sure if there are future plans for the series or not.

Also, the effects take some getting used to.  There is definitely a CGI feel to some of the scenery.  The blood effects are similar to 300.

Regardless of those issues, Spartacus was highly enjoyable.  Even my wife, who was like ""what the heck"" after the first episode, came around and really enjoyed the series.  Maybe because they show sausage.  Some of the gladiator ""locker room"" scenes are like staring at a pack of Johnsonville brats.  There is a lot of blood and nudity in this one - as there should be given that this is a brutal depiction of life as a slave gladiator.

#5 Weeds (3 stars)
Weeds gets a golf-clap 3 star ranking.  Why?  Because the plot just doesn't make sense sometimes.  There are points in this series where you feel like it is going one way and then - boom - the plot takes a 90 degree turn towards something else.  It's not like it makes sense thought.  Rather, it feels more like a different writer came in to write a different episode or something.  It is very strange and it happens a number of times.

Weeds follows the life of a suburban mom who sells pot to make money after her husband dies.  The decision to become a dealer impacts her two sons and her husband's brother - who comes to live with her.  The series starts out with sort of a realistic ""how would this play in the suburbs"" feel, but then progresses down some more eccentric paths.

We have enjoyed the series, but this is not one that we were waiting at the mailbox for the next video to arrive.  It qualifies as a ""we will watch it when we get around to it"" series.

#6 Sex and the City (3 stars)
Sex and the City explores the lives of 4 single women and their quest for happiness and men in New York.  Why 3 stars?  This is the only series that my wife and I would disagree on the ranking.  I suspect she would give it 4 stars and I would give it two.  Frankly, it is too much of a ""chic flick"" for me... and I would guess most men feel the same way.

Wait you say - what about Entourage?  Isn't that basically the same thing with a group of guys?  In a word... no.  It isn't.  For some reason, Entourage just plays better that Sex and the City.  Also, the last couple seasons of Sex and the City really fell off a cliff.  It had the distinct feeling that they were just looking to wrap it up.

Also, speaking as a guy, this series became too ""cultish"" for me.  Do you know how many women started drinking cosmos because of this series?  For that matter, do you know how many ""Rabbits"" sold because of this series?  Sex and the City became sort of a female cultural event.  Guys - that really tells you everything you need to know, doesn't it?

#7 The Tudors (3 stars)
This is a tough one.  The Tudors is a story about the life of Henry V of England and his many wives.  It is good, but I think many people just won't get into this series.  It doesn't have the craziness of Entourage or Californication, nor the blood and guts of Rome and Spartacus.  The Tudors is more of a historical drama.  Consider The Tudors a 3 star teetering on the edge of a 2 star.  I prefer Weeds to The Tudors.  However, I think my wife would maybe rank this a bit higher.

If you choose to watch this series, I strongly recommend committing to watching the first 3-4 episodes at least.  If you just watch one or two, you probably won't stick with it.

I tell you what though - one of the most interesting things about The Tudors is all of the torture.  Watching The Tudors makes any modern ""torture"" techniques look laughable.  Water-boarding?  Bah, that's for sissies!  Give me the rack!

#8 True Blood (2 stars)
True Blood is about life in a small town after vampires have come out of the closet and try to live normal lives with humans... or at least that is what it starts out to be.

Look - I'd love to rate True Blood higher, but the series just gets weirder and weirder as it goes on.  It is like the writers got bored with the standard vampire-human conflict thing so they had to take it in several other directions... and I do mean several.  Suddenly we have werewolves, witches, shape-shifters, fairies, etc, etc.  It gets to the point where you are asking yourself, really?  Really?
I'd give the first season alone 4 stars, but it drops of to 3 stars and then to 2 stars after that.

#9 Big Love (1 star)
Big Love is about a mormon family practicing polygamy.  The story follows the life of one man and his many wives.  My wife liked this a bit more than I did, but it just didn't do it for me.  There really wasn't anything about the show that I found interesting.  I think my wife enjoyed some of the relationship drama, but she stopped watching the series and hasn't expressed an interest in continuing it.  This one was a burn-out.  I think it is because Big Love is maybe too serious - if it had a Californication element to it, I bet it would have been pretty entertaining.

So there you have it my friends.  I may continue to update this list as we watch more series.  The nutshell is that HBO appears to be focusing on more high-end ""production"" type series and Showtime is focusing on lower cost dramas.",1322438400,,7366,4.346323529411765

There are 4 episodes on Disc 1. So if you watched each episode separately, that means you have to sit through 16 - 20 minutes of annoying commercials.

Come on. I bought the DVDs, don't make we regret paying you money HBO instead of finding the episodes on a torrent (which wouldn't have the lousy commercials).",1272585600,,584,4.3

2235231,4,B0007QS324,"This is my first Entourage viewing.  I bought this set for those days when there was nothing to watch on TV.  I was only expecting mild entertainment, but I end up loving it!  My husband and I enjoyed the silliness of those rich and famous people in Hollywood.  We were fascinated with the behind the scenes of movie making, talk show, and how the stars threw parties.  The four boys were from Queens where I grew up.  In fact, I can see Queens Boulevard from my parents' house where they still live.  How can I not love the story of four boys from Queens living big in Hollywood?  I can even understand where Jeremy Piven's character was coming from. This show makes my boring suburban lifestyle very appealing!  Great scripts, great casting, with great directing - each episode is less than 30 minutes.  Very entertaining for mature viewers.

The reason why I did not give this a 5-star rating was the way the menu was set up.  You have to press ENTER several times to get to each episode.  Also the selection pointer blend into the background so you can barely located it.  It was annoying, but I did enjoy each show.",1257638400,,1120,4.48019801980198

  What im really piss about is the fact that the first season DOSEN'T COME IN WIDESCREEN!!!!
Yes, it's just incredible. You will spend $18-$22 US on this 2 DVD's and they are not even widescreen.
Overall, the cd plays good and the previews are cool too.

But if I were you I won't spend money on this product its a waste... Downloaded it.

If this is not a concern to you, or if you just don't care then go ahead and buy, but I'm sure that some people will not like the fact that is not widescreen.",1254787200,,648,3.992248062015504
2235233,5,B0007QS324,"A few years ago I heard Bobcat Goldthwait's ""comeback"" stand-up CD (which is pretty darned funny, by the way...)  Part of his routine dealt with the challenges facing middle-aging men.  At one point he admits that he tries to keep himself in SOME kind of shape for romance reasons: ""If it weren't for women, I'd be fatter than David Crosby!""

I bring this up because women make men do things they wouldn't ordinarily do - some good... some bad.

What if you had a group of men - four best friends from Queens ten years out of high school?  What if ONE of them became a big movie star, hired the other buddies as ""assistants"", moved to Hollywood, and generally got every wish of every teen-aged boy?

Psychology students learn that the id is the part of the human personality that indulges every selfish desire: the characters of ""Entourage"" are almost all id.  (The show is most interesting when the characters are able to suppress their ""manliness"" long enough to show the more desirable human qualities: compassion, kindness, etc.)  Entourage follows the professional and love lives of four friends from New York.

The group's world swirls around Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier), an up and coming 30-ish movie star from Queens.  Vince is the kind of actor who is competing for roles with Jake Gyllenhaal and Leonardo DiCaprio.  Vince's older brother is Johnny ""Drama"" Chase (Kevin Dillon).  In a genius piece of casting Dillon, the not quite as accomplished and good-looking brother of Matt Dillon, plays the not as accomplished and not as good-looking brother of Vince.  While Vince walks through a world where he is always the center, with beautiful women and agents and producers constantly vying for his attention, ""Drama"" was once the star of ""Viking Quest"" two decades ago, and today struggles with attempts to keep his self-esteem afloat in the shadow of his mega-star brother.  Jerry Ferrara plays ""Turtle"", the least talented and only dumpy member of the group.  Turtle knows well that he owes everything to the fame of Vince.  He's happy to lead a love-life that consists of girls drawn to the aura that surrounds Vince who are not chosen by the man himself.  Kevin Connolly plays Eric ""E"" Murphy, Vince's best friend.  ""E"" is the character most rooted in the real world, the one most viewers would identify with.  Vince trusts ""E"" enough to make him his manager, and one of the best continuing storylines of the show involves ""E"" growing from a New York Pizza manager to Hollywood power player.

Jeremy Piven plays Ari Gold, Vince's agent.  Piven has won several awards as the over-the-top Ari - intense and arrogant and vulgar, but again, some of the best moments of the show come when Ari shows the slightest hint of humanity.

Entourage is a behind-the-scenes show, and succeeds in an extremely entertaining way, in the same way that ""The West Wing"" showed us a glimpse behind the curtain at the White House and ""Bull Durham"" gave us an idea of what happens in those pitcher's mound pow-wows that sports fans get to see, but never hear.

Not quite grown up - and with little incentive to do so - the boys live lives that bounce between parties and restaurants, always surrounded by beautiful women, and usually looking for Vince's next project.

What would YOU do if your best friend became the next ten million per movie star and invited you and your other buds from the old `hood to hang out in Hollywood?

This show gives us a delicious ""what if"".",1253577600,,3465,4.754180602006689

2235235,5,B0007QS324,"I loved the first three seasons of THE SOPRANOS.  Some of the best TV ever.  Then the quality fell off.  I haven't tried DEAD LIKE ME or whatever that funeral home show is because every single preview shows men kissing on the mouth.  Not exactly what I want to watch.  I only got about ten minutes into DEADWOOD before the trash talk trashed me out.  Jersey mobsters talk that way, yes.  Cowboys?  Don't know.  But didn't want to hear it from them.  I've heard good things about ROME but, like all HBO shows, I'll probably catch it on DVD if I keep hearing about it.

Then I finally got around to watching ENTOURAGE on DVD.  In order.  If you're not hooked immediately, give it an episode or two because it got better as it went.  You get the feeling that this was a very inside job.  And plenty of cameos from famous people as themselves add to the realism and the humor.

Jeremy Piven is hilarious as the no-holds-barred Hollywood shark chewing his way up the food chain.  His caustic, rapid-fire dialogue is a joy to listen to.

Kevin Dillon as Johnny Drama is also very funny: the older brother who had his shot but threw it away in ways that always seem to come back to haunt him, both personally (feuds with Jimmy Kimmel & Hugh Hefner) and professionally (his hot shot brother has to get him an agent).

This is a smart, knowing show where even the little moments are winners.  I loved the sad sack clown at Ari's kid's birthday party trying to give Ari his headshot and his audition reel during the party.  And it's completely believable that a movie can come together and get made by people who dislike each other only because one of them knows where to score the best weed.  The lust, the greed, the selfishness, the shameless self-promotion--hooray for Hollywood!

Here four guys from Queens make it to Hollywood and success (some directly, and some as the proverbial hanger-ons)

And it is funny and edgy.  From Vincent Chase (the star) and  his childhood friend, Eric Murphy, to Vicent's semi-has been half brother Drama and the other childhood friend Turtle, each charactor has their own distinct personailty and watching them interact is priceless.

And of course there is Ari Gold, brilliantly played by Jeremy Piven.  His over thop foul mouthed antics, with the underlying actual caring of the kids from Queens, is hilarious.",1246233600,,799,5.1

At one point the only reason I kept HBO was due to Entourage and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Now that I can rent or purchase the two shows. I have canceled my subscription to them.",1234137600,,557,4.110091743119266

After the first chapter, I was hooked: it means it is a very good TV show.

When I started seeing Entourage, It seemed a little bit ""superficial"" for my taste, but after a few dialogues, excellent interpretations and identifiable scenes, I was convinced that this series have ""something"" special going on.

Imagine you get a few million dollars and move to Hollywood to live a media star-lifestyle. But adding a little extra: you take your best friends with you. When I said ""identifiable"" before I was refering to the characters of the show: they are actually like real persons you know or have known over the years. There's always an oportunistic Johnny ""Drama"", you probably have met many annoying ""Turtles"" in your lifetime, and I'm sure you have a ""best friend"" (like Eric) who struggles with love and responsabilities and who makes you take him seriously and care about him.

What may seem ""shallow"" at first becomes a very close look at the real Celebrity lifestyle, but in the middle of that we have a special connection of a group of four friends that despite their fights, glories and sex-conquests (there are plenty!), still mantain their true bond.

Highly recommended for men (I believe that women will not find Entourage so addictive like we guys do).

Adrian Grenier is Vincent Chase, a up and coming actor who's keeping it old school with his loyalty to his friends and brother, taking them along for the rollercoaster ride that is his acting career. Every girl seemingly is charmed by Vince...his life is right out of a bachelors fairytale! Let your mind wander freely...
I can't make up my mind who my favorite character is but ""E"" is 1 of 2 characters I love. Kevin Connelly plays Eric, Vince's best friend turned manager...He doesn't put up with with anybody's crap, hard nosed and hopelessly destined to fall in love with whoever he talks to for more than a week...""E"" keeps it real thru the whole fantasy world of Entourage with probably the most believable of the characters( you can see K.C. getting decked by Stallones boy in Rocky 5)""E"" evolves into Vinces manger as the series evolves...
Kevin Dillon is the ever annoying Johnny ""Drama"", Vinces half brother who is always looking to snag Vince's coat tails to keep his ""B"" level acting career going...he's a trip conming equipped with the most quirky personality on the show...he knows no shame and is officially the cook for the crew...
Jerry Ferrara, who palys the role of ""Turtle"", the mooch of tag a long...but he is about as cool as anyone can be in this role!!! Always looking for the angle to get hooked up on Vinces Celebrity status, Turtle is the wise cracking side kick type who adds the smart a@@ banter that keeps you laughing and keeps you watching...he is officially Vince's Driver...I'd love that job!!!
Ari Gold is my other favorite character played to a tee by Jeremy Piven...he so often type casted as the nerdy sidekick or villan as he was in ""Old School"" but not anymore...Piven has broken that cycle playing Vinces ""ULTRA CRASS"" agent. Ari is always in the mix of the main plot, trying to get the big pay day for Vince in the form of his first breakout movie role. I love Ari...he's hard to stomach but then at times so am I...birds of a feather i guess???!

2235250,5,B0007QS324,"but women love this show too! I'm one of them! I loved Sex and the city - have the dvd collection and watch it repeatedly. Entourage is for guys what sex and the city was for women. And the show is so addictive! I had heard about the show, but didn't start watching till season 3...and I was hooked! The show is that awesome. From the characters to the scenery to the diolouge - this show has it all. Season one is the shortest season - only 8 episodes. But it is definately worth having to see how it all began. IMO, don't let the first couple of episodes fool you. It takes a couple of episodes to start building up steam and for the writers to find their way...but stick with it and you will see it all start to gel together. And it just gets better and better. I own all the seasons now...up to season 4. Seaon 5 has just started on HBO but I'll buy the dvd as soon as it comes out! There's great chemistry between the characters...Vince, the handsome movie star who all things revolve around....Eric ""E""...Vince's best friend and voice of reason...Johnny Drama...Vince's brother who used to be on top and dreams of being there again...Turtle...Vince's friend and gopher. You get the sense that they are a real family - and would die for each other. Ari Gold is Vince's agent...and kind of the dysfunctional father figure (lol). Put them all together - and you have perfection. I would reccommend buying all the dvd's...because your going to want to watch them all over and over again.

2235251,5,B0007QS324,"One of the funniest shows I have seen.  After Sopranos, Rome, HBO did a great job handling this show.  The show is about up and coming star Vince and his friends (Entourage).  The characters are well written.  And another important character is Jeremy Piven's Ari, who plays Vince's agent.  Without him this show wouldn't have bee successful.  Very funny show.",1217462400,,360,4.916666666666667
2235252,5,B0007QS324,"Having heard about Entourage for a couple years now, I decided to finally give it a shot after prolonging it for quite some time. The show didn't look that appealing to me and the main actor who plays Vincent, Adrian Grenier, just seemed like a `B' actor to me. But after I kept hearing my friends talk about the show, I decided to pick it up at a store here in Iraq. It has all 4 seasons in it for like 30 bucks... hehe.

After a few episodes I was really into the show. It's definitely funny and that's what I wanted. To truly enjoy the show, you must let common sense go, because it just doesn't go well with this show. One prime example is that Vincent Chase is a lead star that's just had a huge movie premier. He's a big name actor (sorta) now and he's got a pretty boy face to go with that role. But he can go anywhere he wants around town and never seem to get swamped with fans or the paparazzi. If you can let the little things go, I believe you'll truly enjoy the show.

Now Vince is an up and coming star and he has his boys from high school with him along with his old brother Johnny `Drama' Chase. Drama, as most call him, is what you would call a `B' actor. Most of his stints have been not big characters on some popular shows such as Melrose Place and Viking Quest (which I'm thinking is supposed to be Hercules) and some not so known shows as well.  Turtle is one of the good friends, and his main job is to be a driver and do certain errands Vinny needs. He's not Vin's slave by no means, but this is how he earns his keep so he doesn't have to be a full blown moocher. Eric is Vince's best friend and has been since they were about 6 years old. Eric has his head on his shoulders and is here to try and help Vince with his career. He's not trying to be a mooch, but just trying to help his friend. Vince makes Eric his manager to help with scripts and to make his life easier. And when I say easier...I mean it as in Vinny doesn't have to talk to Ari Gold (played BRILLIANTLY by Jeremy Piven), a cold hearted, hard as nails, wise cracking, smart butt, genius, and on the top of his game agent. Ari and Eric's arguments are some of the best parts of the show. Both hard headed and both trying to help Vincent, but in somewhat different ways. The whole cast is great and definitely grow on you as the season(s) goes on. Along with the cast you also have a LOT of big name cameos. I was quite surprised to see so many.

What I love about the show is that it makes life seem so fun being rich. Once Vinny makes millions from his first movie, he buys a huge house for him and friends to live in. Cars for them. They take trips when they want. Just hang out and do things we all wished we could do. And when someone like Jessica Alba talks to them, everything is so nonchalant. If it was me, I don't think I'd be able to even speak. Ok maybe I would, but my words would come out all Jibba Jabba like.

And yes there is a story that goes with the show. In season one the big thing is getting Vincent another movie while he's hot. Eric puts a hurting on that because Ari just wants whatever will get Vincent big money, while Eric wants to help get Vinny a good script regardless of the money. Like other shows, it has one `main' theme for the season, while each episode has a mini-story itself.

All in all, I'm very happy I tried this show out. Very funny and I highly recommend it. Especially to guys, even though I know a lot of girls like it too. But like another reviewer mentioned... Entourage is sorta like a Sex in the City for guys.

The show does have a LOT of language that isn't suitable for children in my opinion. Some nudity (though not much) is also in here...like boobs!",1208736000,17,3699,4.086776859504132

Some of the other characters, especially the lazy celebrity friends, are lame. I don't even particularly like the main character. To me, the agent makes the series.

The thing I greatly dislike about this series is the blatant sex--lots of nude women and sexual situations.  I think this film is very demeaning to women and portrays them as sexual objects.  The producers put nudity and scantily dressed women in wherever they can to draw in a bigger audience.

Seems the writers finally found their groove.  Still, the first season lacks any sort of depth or any real laugh out loud moments.  It's just light fluff like watching a group of guys who won the lottery in the land of the rich and beautiful.  The only one who comes close to have any sort of depth is Johnny Drama and then Ari a close second.  Our leading star, Vince, is as interesting as watching grass grow.

You sleep with a big star and you run the studio.  How did that happen?  I'll give it a shot.  Stars and bigwigs have bodily functions, so by serendipity a mere mortal ends up in bed with a goddess.  The mortal by association becomes a god.

In the celebrity-worship myth, by merely looking at Paris Hilton on a magazine cover, we possess her.  The fantasy cost to Paris is debatable.  Entourage indulges this fantasy and it portrays the trivialities of the movie business from the inside as the movie star's homies interact with plebeians and elites in the business.

I must say that the first episode almost lost me as the boys are merely chauvinistic morons, but as the episodes evolve, I saw the light: these young men are twenty something dudes in a lucky situation beyond their wildest dreams and they are making something out of it.  Who wouldn't?

Fresh and off the streets of Los Angeles, HBO's series takes us into the life and world of show business. There's the aging actor (Kevin Dillon), the new rising star (Adrian Grenier), the fickle conscience (Kevin Connolly), and the moocher (Jerry Ferrara), yet topped with an adrenaline juiced Jeremy Piven the show never stops. Ever.

Between Dillon's insatiable and loveable loser to the likeable, feel-kind-of-bad for Kevin Connolly, there is someone in this show to love and hate. Mostly love.

While this season is only eight episodes, it's enough to get introduced to the idea of these characters. Though further seasons will only add to the layers. Not much is built here, other than the distant touch and feel lifestyle of these guys. This is an introduction.

Plus this might be your only chance to see some of LA's hottest night clubs and women without laying down thousands on an Armani suit and a decent hair style. All you need to do is shell out a twenty and pick up this season.

It's premise is simple, a young actor hits it big in Hollywood, and he brings his friends along for the ride. The trials and tribulations that ensue are nothing short of ridiculous, even ludicrous.

2235288,4,B0007QS324,"I don't have HBO.  In fact, I don't even have cable.  However, I have friends who do and when some of them were talking about the latest season of the HBO show, ENTOURAGE, I had no idea what they were talking about or what the hype was about.  Then this past summer I was staying at a hotel and was flipping through the channels and came across an episode of ENTOURAGE (Season 3) that had just started.  Actually, I didn't even know it was ENTOURAGE until after the show ended.  But, I had been intrigued by the opening scene and sat fascinated for over twenty minutes.  The writing was superb and I found myself compelled by the characters on the screen and wanted to see what would happen to them next.  I had become hooked and a fan just through that one episode.

Season One of the series is only eight episodes long.  In the pilot episode the characters of the series or introduced:  Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier) Hollywood's latest big star and the man who the entourage hovers; Eric Murphy (Kevin Connolly) Vince's best friend and personal manager; Johnny ""Drama"" Chase (Kevin Dillon) Vincent's half brother and a B-actor who was living in L.A. trying to make it big long before his brother hit the scene; and Turtle (Jerry Ferrara) Vincent's 2nd closest friend and supposedly musician of the group.  These four grew up together back in Queens and watching them you know that no matter that what happens they'll stick with each other through thick and thin.  Oh, there's one other member of Vince's entourage, his agent, Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven).  Vince is going to be the biggest thing in Hollywood and Ari knows it, but their relationship is more than that--Ari likes Vince and his boys even if he won't ever admit it

At face value, ENTOURAGE is basically a soap opera for men, but set in L.A.  The first season could also be described as a dramatic SEINFELD set in L.A. because not a whole lot happens.  There are only eight episodes in the season revolving around Vince's first big movie premier and his next movie project.  There are references and allusions that help with the continuity of the show, but not a lot really happens.  There are a lot of pretty woman and locations and that's one appeal.  Another might be Jeremy Piven.  His portrayal of Ari Gold is magnificent and a tour-de-force. Ari appears in every episode, but his character is so strong one wishes that he could be in every other scene.  There are also the guest stars that pop up:  Gary Busey, Jessica Alba, Scarlett  Johansson, and Jimmy Kimmel are just a handful of the guest stars that show up during the season.

For me, besides my fascinating introduction to the series, there are two other factors that have caused me to be drawn to the series.  One is the cinematography.  The shots done in this show are amazing.  From ten minute one shot takes to personal moments filmed through a window like memory in the scrapbook of one's mind the filming one this series is unlike anything I have ever seen done on television before. In that sense, the series is ground breaking.

The other thing that draws me to the series is the relationship between the four friends.  I don't live in the way that Vince and his boys live.  I don't live in L.A. and my friends and I don't talk the way Vince does or treat woman the way they do.  However, the bond of friendship they share is something I relate to strongly.  I've compared ENTOURAGE to SEINFELD and a soap opera, but it's also kind of like a prepped-up version of BAND OF BROTHERS but without any blood and guts.

The first season does move slowly, but from what I've seen and been told that's because it's setting the tone and characters for things to come later.  After having watched all of series one, I'm excited to see how things turn out in Season Two (and find out how Vince Chase got picked as Aquaman).

This is only a two disc set with eight episodes so the special features with this DVD are limited.

The plot moves slowly, if at all, and when an opportunity arrives for the writers to create some real tension or excitment, they side-step it.

2235291,4,B0007QS324,"Entourage has taken a special place near the top of my TV viewing rotation. The first season was the hook and sinker that got me addicted to this crazy show detailing the entourage of an up and coming star and their everyday life.

It's a view of the `in' lifestyle of the Hollywood elite (and those who latch on) in an entertaining, satirical and audacious style. The show trots out guest star after guest star giving the show a very `real' kinda vibe while casting the guest stars in such a way to appease the general expectations of the audience. Seeing stars `outside' their acting element talking to agents, seeing angry Hollywood execs, lunatic directors, etc all become great elements to contribute to the story.

A curiously interesting facet of the show for those from, in, or familiar with the SoCal area is the identification of areas featured on the show. If one has visited Almor Wine & Spirits or shopped at the various high class venues the boys shop there is a little bit of a ""I've been there!"" feeling that emerges.

2235295,5,B0007QS324,"Entourage is a show that I still can't believe can be nearly as good as it is.  The story follows an up-and-coming movie star named Vince Chase (Adrian Grenier) and his three best friends.  Eric ""E"" Murphy (Kevin Connolly), his manager and only responsible friend, Turtle (Jerry Ferrara), a pot-smoking moocher, and Johnny ""Drama"" Chase (Kevin Dillon), his older brother and out-of-work C-list actor.  The quartet basically spends most of the show hanging out, partying, chasing women, and living the life that most guys can only dream of.  Vince is a very good actor, but his looks have cemented him as Hollywood's next big thing, and he quickly changed from a poor boy from Queens into a very wealthy man.  Only he and Eric do any actual work while Drama and (especially) Turtle are content to get by on Vince's coattails.  They all live together in a huge house full of amazing televisions, the latest video game systems, pinball machines, and a pool.  The idea of watching four guys slacking off while living in a way most people can barely even imagine initially turned me off.  Still, it began getting great reviews from critics and was embraced by audiences, including my brother.  Finally, I decided to check it out.  Initially, I disliked it, but I later gave it a second chance towards the end of the second season, and I realized how good the show could be!

On the surface, this show is what I described above, but it isn't nearly as shallow as it might seem.  Despite what we are led to believe, the main character is NOT Vince, it's Eric.  Eric is definitely playing the straight man against the (hilariously) clueless Drama, lazy and useless Turtle, and the easily-influenced Vince.  He must put up with his friends' bad choices as well as Vince's agent Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven), who is one of the show's best characters.  Ari is a great agent, but he must sacrifice much of his humanity in order to serve his client (much to the chagrin of his wife).  Ari and Eric constantly clash over how to deal with getting Vince his next job; Eric advises against a high-paying but trashy studio picture, which greatly upsets Ari.  The main storyline of the season is about how Vince and Eric try to find Vince's next film.  Also, Eric must deal with his relationship issues; he tends to get easily attached to the wrong women who end up emotionally abusing him.

One of my favorite aspects of the series is Drama's attempts to break back out onto the scene.  Despite Vince's many attempts to help him out, Drama can't seem to get an acting job.  Pretty much all he has to look back on is a series called Viking Quest which is now syndicated on the Sci Fi Channel.  Of all the main characters, Turtle is by far my least favorite.  His role, while necessary to show the worst kind of person who can attach themselves to someone famous, exists to take without giving, provide Vince with drugs, and make fun of Eric.  Strangely, the least developed character is Vince himself; he comes off as somewhat of a one-dimensional star who gets hot women without even trying and is completely ignorant about issues of money, which he leaves up to Eric, who can barely bring himself to persuade Vince from buying more expensive (and unneccessary) items even though they don't have a steady income.  In fact, Grenier has even said that he wasn't a big fan of the first episode becuase of the way his character is portrayed.  And I must say that the first couple episodes are only so-so.  If I didn't already know that the quality would dramatically increase in future episodes, I would have given up.  However, once the characters' lifestyle is established, the series begins to get better.

I would reccommend this series to anyone who has merely written Entourage off as a guilty pleasure (which is sort of is at times), but if you get a few hours in, you'll see that it is much more than four guys in LA living the high life.",1151107200,3,3919,4.6147186147186146
2235296,3,B0007QS324,"Of all the shows that HBO has done in the past few years, this is overall one of the least interesting.  The main characters are fairly likable and Jeremy Piven is outstanding, but all in all not too much happens.  A number of reviewers here have used the word ""realistic,"" but how would anyone know?  I suspect that much of the appeal is similar to reading People magazine.  We voyeuristically get to look into the life of a pretend celebrity and his group of cronies, frequently encountering real celebrities.

Here is the basic problem with the show, however:  there are no especially interesting story arcs, no especially funny episodes, and apart from Jeremy Piven character, and no real character development.  I have only seen Season One and perhaps it picks up in season two, but based on the first season I have to confess that I am baffled by the widespread attention it is getting.  Piven is a delight in every scene he is in, but even performers I have enjoyed in other projects, like my beloved Debi Mazar and the impossible adorable Samaire Armstrong, are at less than their best.  One exception to the overall mediocrity of the performers is Kevin Dillon as Johnny Chase, Vincent's brother.  Perhaps because he has in real life a better known actor brother (Matt), he is wonderfully convincing as a has-been struggling under his brother's shadow.  But Adrian Grenier is simply awful as the supposed hot young movie star.  He seems in fact to be a hopeless pretty boy who might have limited potential on television melodrams, but not much else.  Jerry Ferrara as Turtle has to be one of the most annoying actors in the world.  Kevin Connolly as Eric is fairly likable, but at most he comes across as a moderately enjoyable but mildly pathetic hanger on.

The relative success of the series disturbs me.  I can see why some people might enjoy it.  It has a certain degree of name dropping and settings that celebrity fans could enjoy.  But what if you aren't a celebrity hound?  The show makes no important points about the world Vincent and his boys inhabit.  The show doesn't even explore that world but merely accepts it and uses it as the background to some mildly comic situations.  Perhaps the show improves in the second season, but under no circumstances could I describe it as more than mildly enjoyable.  It beats driving in heavy traffic, but it isn't something that I want to watch simply because it is truly good.  If I think about some truly good shows on TV--LOST, say, or VERONICA MARS or THE GILMORE GIRLS--the contrast couldn't be greater.  One of the saddest things to consider is that with the ending of THE SOPRANOS and DEADWOOD, this is pretty much the flagship show for HBO.  Lo! how the mighty are fallen.  Just to think that only a few years ago this was the cable network that was home for so many great shows.  Perhaps the new SIX FEET UNDER will premiere soon.",1151107200,3,2901,4.648330058939096
2235297,5,B0007QS324,"What would it be like to have fame, wealth, beautiful women and every want, need and desire fullfilled? And what is the downside and pitfalls to this? Those are the questions the wickedly funny, HBO comedy series, ""Entourage"" tries to answer as it takes a brilliant, satirical look at the lifestyle, deal making and personal politics behind modern day, Hollywood babylon. In the series we meet Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier) an up and coming movie star, who is just on the cusp of truely hitting the big-time. This is coming to be, thanks in part to his conniving, deal-making agent, Ari Gold (wonderfully played by Jeremy Piven). But in a town where the sincerety is just as fake as the hugs, smiles and big [...], you need someone you can depend on to keep things real and watch your back. For this Vince depends on an ""Entourage"" of guys from his old Queens, neighborhood. They include his best friend and eternally worried manager, Eric (Kevin Connolly), his brother (a 'has-been' actor), Johnny 'Drama' (Kevin Dillon) and finally, Uber-mooch/gopher/driver, 'Turtle (Jerry Ferrara). We follow Vince and his boys as they work and play their way through the maze of hedonistic Hollywood, much like Alice experienced Wonderland. What makes this so much fun is that we get to vicariously experience the 'hot' willing women, Hollywood mansions and limos/Hummers with them. In this first season we are introduced to the characters and watch the main story arc of Vince getting the role (against Ari's wishes) in an artsy, 'indie' film called ""Queens Boulevard"". The writing for this show is razor sharp, the dialogue will make you bust a gut laughing (""Call me Helen Keller, because I'm a f**cking miracle worker!"") and the cast is fabulous. Watch throughout the series for celeb guest appearances from Jessica Alba, Luke Wilson, Gary Busey, Jimmy Kimmel and Val Kilmer (playing a dippy, 'new age', Sherpa/pot dealer).

Their dialogue is perfect for a bunch of old friends from Queens, and Jeremy Piven as ""Super Agent"" Ari Gold  is both hilarious and disturbing. He and the writers have really created a great character. I wish I could paste some of his more memorable quotes, but most of them would get me pulled from Amazon. Suffice it to say that he is not the most politically correct of people and he has an acid tounge. The phrase ""Let's hug it out, [...]!"" will take on new meaning for you.

It focuses on an up and coming Hollywood star and his group of hangers on, or entourage. The movie star, Vince, has a pretty face and some acting talent but he's grown far too used to getting what he wants. Eric is the best friend and personal manager who keeps him grounded. Turtle, his gopher, is an annoying little punk you'd like to slap around but that's part of his charm. Jeremy Pivin is Ari, Vince's sleazy but effective agent. My favorite character is Vince's has-been brother, Johnny Drama, played by Kevin Dillon. Just about everything Dillon says is hilarious and he's made me laugh so hard I've cried a couple of times.

Who would enjoy watching the antics of such miscreants? Surprisingly, me and I hate superficial nighttime soaps like the O.C. I've never enjoyed anything Aaron Spelling has done yet I can't get enough of Entourage. I think the secret is in how the show doesn't take itself too seriously. Obviously this isn't reality. The women in this show have no defense against our gang. Don't some of them have husbands or boyfriends? Where are the pushy paparazzi who hound Hollywood stars incessantly? Questions like this have no relevance in Entourage. It's a party, player, roll with it.

Since I don't have HBO, I'll have to wait until they come out with the second season on DVD to keep up with my boys. You can bet I will.",1137715200,4,1569,4.5371024734982335

The characters live a lifestyle that we just couldn't care about; the only one I actually liked was the Eric character, but the rest were so stupid, boring and unappealing that it became too painful to watch.

2235358,5,B0007QS324,"Like most of you mildly miserable folks, I enjoy a healthy serving of shadenfreude when watching a show about handsome, successful Hollywood types. I like... scratch that... I feel unbridled glee when one of these beautiful people get hit with a shovelful of trouble and a cannonball in the gut of comeuppance. Sorry to say, you won't experience this nasty little feeling when watching this splendid half-hour of comedy (with just a lightest sprinkling of drama). It is darn near impossible to root against the five main leads as they navigate their way through the sun-soaked, egomaniacal LA mayhem.

The series has a dreamy, low-key flow that centers around the impossibly good-looking Vinnie Chase, a charming young actor on the rise who surrounds himself with a retinue of pals relocated from Queens, NY.  Entourage boasts the most entertaining comedic TV duo since Jason Bateman and David Garrison went head to head in ""It's Your Move."" Vincent's older brother and C-list actor, the cocky and sublimely insecure Johnny Drama (Kevin Dillon in his best role ever) is rarely seen without sidekick Turtle, the chubby yet confident gofer/chauffer/schemer. Everyone on the planet has met or hung out with a Turtle-kinda-guy, but probably none as impishly appealing.

The effortless badinage between these two (and the entire group) is hilarious, realistic and not too overboard with f-bombs and requisite, hackneyed  guy talk. The exquisite Jeremy Piven plays fast-talking, ber-agent Ari Gold who is equally hysterical with his complete lack of caring or self-censoring and is creating a new language for hipsters today - ""Let's hug it out."" -  in the vein of ""Swingers."" The scenes of unctuous Ari terrorizing his underlings at work are masterful, but the real fun is watching him at home trying to cut deals with his equally combative wife.

The grounded Kevin Connolly plays Vince's best friend and manager who keeps it real and is the only one looking for an honest relationship, a nice contrast to the one-nighters by the others. The characters have their faults, but because they rarely take themselves too seriously and realize just how lucky they are to be living in mansions and hanging with the vapid pretty people, you hope this odd yet functional family unit always comes out on top.

The writing, directing and editing is top-notch - subtle, wacky and always touching - and again, if I didn't make my point before, simply hilarious. One nitpick: the show goes a bit overboard with product placement, but hey, that's Hollywood, and they actually make light of it when Vinnie goes on the Jimmy Kimmel show. So all is forgiven.  I just watched all of Season Two in one sitting (Thank you HBO for the free promotional weekend!) and it is as good, if not better, than the first.",1126396800,18,2785,4.974193548387097

You will get addicted.  It's one of those rare shows that flys by.  When it's over, you're disappointed and want to see what would happen next.

The characters are believable and hillarious in an authentic way.  The dialogue carries the show.  This ain't ""Friends.""  No contrived little plotlines.  It's just a group of guys living it up in Los Angeles.  When you think about it, the writers actually show good restraint.  It'd be easy to have the guys doing all sorts of over-the-top things.

The real star of the show is Ari (Jeremy Piven).  He's a motor-mouth neurotic agent.  He steals every scene, every episode.  Think Jay Mohr's character out of Jerry McGuire.  Or better yet, an example from Season 2.  Another agent says that Vinny has slept with every actress in town.  Eric asks Ari if he's going to just sit back and let someone bad-mouth his client.

With two small children tugging at my pant hems, I cannot offer the in-depth critique other Amazon shoppers spend hours composing. I can merely say what I see without analysis beyond the half hour of each episode. And so, I am writing this review from the Everyman perspective.

Now with that disclaimer, I'll say that the ensemble seems to have been casted to confirm America's assumptions about young, hot Hollywood celebrities and the company they keep. First of all, I live in LA and can safely say that my town isn't saturated with scantily clad temptresses, though we may have a greater concentration of them than Milwaukee.

The series revolves around new marquee sensation Vincent Chase played like a young buck who believes every crumb of praise by Adrian Grenier; his brother Johnny Drama, a post-prime character actor played by Matt Dillon's brother Kevin; Kevin Connolly in the role of Eric, who is gradually gaining confidence as Vincent's makeshift manager; and Jerry Ferrara as the hanger-on Turtle who is a barrel of laughs and not much more. These guys had the good fortune of growing up with Vince in Queens. The most richly realized character is Ari, the fast-talking Hollywood agent with a tiny heart of gold, played by the outstanding but heretofore underrated Jeremy Piven, more famous as John Cusack's sidekick from Chicago. The role allows Piven to finally prove his considerable talent as an interpretative actor who does it like he is it.

Beyond the celebrity myth, the action flows fluidly as the characters move from trendy club to agent's office to pool party to one night stand to bloody mary in the morning to the next of six episodes. I'm reminded of ER with the camera tracking characters across the floor from one medical disaster to another.

Altogether, Entourage is a fun, light way to spend the evening after the kids are snoozing. If you don't have time for HBO or any other cable service and can't afford to think about what you've watched beyond the end credits, this is a series that's worth replaying. My wife and I look forward to adding Season Two to our DVD library.",1123632000,2,2195,4.8453333333333335

The chemistry between all of the actors is evident and the  cameos from real life celebrities is fun. Eight episodes is short, thankfully season two is almost twice as long.  My only beef is the commentary; I wish the cast had been in on it.  Maybe for season 2?",1122422400,2,399,4.410958904109589
2235372,4,B0007QS324,"I watched this out of morbid curiosity about the concept of ""entourages"", those parasitic friends of celebrities who reap the benefit of the luxurious lifestyle without having to work for it (except to keep the actor from being lonely, heaven forbid such a needy person from ever being alone!). That this show was produced by ""Marky"" Mark Wahlberg, who is particularly known for his entourage, lends great realism and credibility to this series.

The first episode was okay. I almost didn't want to watch any more after that, because it didn't really impress me, but after episode 2, I was hooked! What I don't understand is why the true stars of this show play second fiddle to the main guy (Adrian Grenier, playing an up-and-coming actor who can't make decisions on his own). Kevin Connolly is the star of this show, playing best friend Eric, who manages Vincent Chase's career and other choices, even though he doesn't have any experience in Hollywood or any personal connections to it, other than being the high school buddy who gives up his personal goals to follow his famous friend to Hollywood. He is the brains behind the group and should be the one making the Hollywood career instead of the lame-brained actor friend.

Jerry Ferrara as the wise-cracking friend Turtle reminds me of many sidekicks who tag along in life to their star buddies. He offers much of the humor with his comments delivered with a Brooklyn-style accent (although they are from Queens). He has a loyal guard dog vibe, all too willing to accept left over scraps of women Vincent no longer wants or never wanted.

Kevin Dillon plays the older brother of Vincent with a waning acting career of his own. Its an ironic role, as he looks and sounds familiar to his own famous brother Matt Dillon. However, I find his character to be the most annoying, particularly that he's a hanger-on, expecting his brother's popularity to help his own career out of the B-list of actors.

The biggest joy to watch is Jeremy Piven, who often plays the loyal sidekick in many films (""The Family Man"", ""Serendipity""). He simply shines here, as a sleazy agent with a wandering eye. He doesn't like the fact that to get through to his client Vincent, sometimes he has to talk to Eric, the manager. Jeremy is an actor I'd like to see in more meaningful roles, so hopefully this series will graduate him out of the cast-typing of loyal sidekick into an actor of his own standing.

What really lends a realism to this show are the cameos and sly references to famous people or the use of invented celebrities to wink at the real ones (such as the female singer with the hots for Vincent even though she made a very public vow of chastity until marriage--shades of Jessica Simpson/Britney Spears). Even Mark Wahlberg has a cameo. There are a few surprises by other celebrities, and even a former reality show winner (the very wholesomely beautiful Lisa Donohue of ""Big Brother 3"") makes an appearance.

I can't wait to see season 2 when it comes on DVD. I only wish the first season had more than 8 half hour episodes. Hopefully they can maintain a longer season for however long this series is meant to last. Its a worthwhile look at an interesting Hollywood phenomenon.",1121990400,87,3227,4.712765957446808
2235373,5,B0007QS324,"This is a great Show, it is very funny.  I only started watching entourage durring the second season and had to go out and buy the first season.  The second season is better so far but this is still a great season.  One of the funniest parts of this show is all of the cameos.  The funniest has to be Gary Busey.  Over all I highly reconmend these DVDs, the only problem that I have with them is that each Show is 25 minutes where as the Sopranos and Oz each show is 55 minutes.  But still well worth it.",1121299200,2,504,3.99
2235374,4,B0007QS324,"At the core of ""Entourage"" we have a story about individuals who have no idea that there are consequences to their actions. Yes, they do drugs and womanize, but more outrageously they fling money at jets and houses, hit golf balls at celebrity's houses and berate people waiting in line to see the wrong movie. All of this is played for comedy to very successful results on this show. The story line revolves around Vincent Chase, an actor on his way up, and his friends who have attached themselves to him so that they too can live the easy life. The best of these characters in Vincent's brother, Johnny Drama. He especially takes off in the second half of the season when his idiotic ways become more prevalent. Together these characters seem to represent everything conservatives hate about Hollywood: They're vapid, self-involved, and most importantly rich. There is no better way to make a conservative angry than to not work for money he spends his entire life selling his soul wishing he could have, and Vincent has tons of cash. The best episode revolves around his appearance on Jimmy Kimmel's show. Watch as the characters expose an actress' sexual secret, accuse the host of abandonment, and get in the ever necessary product placement and try not to laugh. I also defy you to tell me that you do not know a Turtle. The dialogue is sharp, witty and funny. My only complaint would be that, except for the final episode, it makes no attempt to reach for any dramatic heights. ""Sex and the City,"" a very similar show, was masterful at blending comedy and drama. While watching the final episode I was unimpressed, until the very end. At the climax of the season they wallop you over the head with a heavy dose of sentimentality that works just right in it's attempt to humanize the characters. Of course not all shows have to make you feel, and in the barren wasteland that is TV comedy you should cherish every laugh you can get. Here we can laugh at a group of guys, who thanks to a single pretty face between the four of them are able to live the luxurious life of a rich frat house (yes they even live together). Girls are objects to be won and life is to be lived to the fullest. Along the way we deal with the dilemma of Vincent's next film (studio or indie?) and that provides a wonderful conflict between Eric (his best friend and manager) and Ari (his blood sucking, gold digging agent). I very much look forward to season 2. 7.25 out of 10",1118102400,2,2458,4.538288288288288
2235375,4,B0007QS324,"Fame, fortune, luxury, and letting it all go to your head; agents, managers, publicists, and everyone else that will lie, cheat, or steal to get a piece of you; and remembering your real friends. These are all key ingredients that make ""Entourage"" thoroughly entertaining, as well as freighting when you think about how it's based on reality.

I take the show as a cautionary tale; the entertainment industry is where I have just barely started to get my feet wet. There is a lot of truth in this fictional show: either everyone wants a piece of you or no one knows your name and can't spare a minute of their time. From my limited time spent dealing with people of the industry, on either coast, I have already found more jerks and egos-out-of-control than I care to recount. ""Entourage"" does an excellent job of exposing the dangers of the L.A. lifestyle, while simultaneously managing to present them in a thoroughly enjoyable manner.

The superficial world that is the entertainment business is navigated successfully through the four different personalities that make up the entourage. The four personalities of the Rising Star, Has-Been, Bum, and Level-headed Average Guy balance out the cast and provide a character for everyone to enjoy or relate to. Their friendship and their dependence on each other make the characters a success, as well as a success in the world of the show.

Jeremy Piven's role as agent to rising star, Vincent Chase, is thoroughly entertaining as well as aggravating. He's not quite the villain, but the perfect embodiment of the guy you don't want working against you. His quick one-liners and perfect delivery make it a joy to watch the show, whereas a real-life encounter with a guy such as him would probably make you want to deck him.

""Entourage"" is rife with inside jokes, but not enough to lose the average viewer. Instead, the average viewer might just see the show as a bunch of losers whining about the good life and living high off the hog without really working. I enjoy it, but it's certainly not for everybody. I see it as another example of why I don't, and never want to, live in Los Angeles.

Show business is unlike any other business: they work by their own rules and decide who to let into their little clique. It's about as safe as sleeping in a pit full of vipers, but our glimpse at what it's like to live on top is good a one.",1118016000,34,2384,4.666666666666667

8050588,5,B0007QS324,"Having grown up in working class Chicago, a lot of Entourage is very familiar to me. The relentless dissing of each other, the misogyny and homophobia, the repeated self-destructive behavior, as well as the anger, pain, and desperation underlying all those things is at times painfully familiar. I grew up with these guys, though luckily, I did not go to Hollywood with them. Initially, the Hollywood fantasy seems to be an endless round of partying, sex, and drugs with a never ending line of the prettiest people available, all done under the enraptured gaze of an adoring public. Slowly, gradually, over eight seasons, the fantasy does begin to unravel and the sharp edges hidden in the shadows begin to cut, sometimes cutting very deeply indeed. In its early seasons Entourage is a fun, vicarious romp through a Los Angles celebrity life style as alien to most of us as life on Mars would be. In its later seasons the series begins looking at the consequences of that life style. Those later seasons are what moves this series for me from a ""fun story telling"" 4 stars to a ""powerful story telling"" 5 stars. Enjoy, and hang in there for all eight seasons if you can.",1522540800,,1170,4.712195121951219

It was entertaining and nostalgic to watch the characters grow and enjoy the all the very encouraging banter they give each other and to learn a bit more about how Hollywood operates.

Each main character had their significance and unique personality of strengths and weaknesses that represented a sub-society of Hollywood culture. When one of the characters are going through their rough patch in life, the rest are there to help pick 'em back up. Although they are always clowning on each other non-stop, there is still an incredible brotherhood amongst them - and b*tches...lots of those too.",1517356800,,778,4.8059701492537314

The more I see, the less I like Jeremy Piven - although it's nice to see him in SOMETHING that doesn't include/involve his pal John Cusack. (He was good in ""Just Write,"" and not much else since.) Piven is the irony behind the underlying backstory of Entourage. He is the embodiment of the actor who is successful in spite of the fact that he couldn't act his way out of a burning pup tent. Either that or I'm completely wrong and he's the greatest actor of his generation. Watching him is painful. He looks like a guy with a severe crick in his neck; two trick knees, and arthritic elbows - all the while holding back a load from a bout of severe diarrhea. The Millennial fitting suit (too small) is just a bonus annoyance. I like everyone else for the most part.
