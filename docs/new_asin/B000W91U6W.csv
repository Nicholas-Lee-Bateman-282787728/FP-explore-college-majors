2963480,5,B000W91U6W,"CBS made a bad mistake by not renewing this show.  Every show usually needs a season or two to find its audience and tweak it's direction.  The show ended with major potential but after the Writer's Strike CBS turned it's back on it.  Despite a dedicated audience, CBS didn't give it a chance ... shame on you.  CBS should stand for ""Cowardly Broadcast Service.""  As for ratings, it did no worse than NBC's ""ER"" but that show still airs despite the public's demand to put it out of everyone's misery.  Go figure... Hollywood executives from the reality program generation hard at work for the good of mankind.  And so it goes.....",1220140800,16,630,4.621621621621622
2963481,5,B000W91U6W,"Cane was my favourite tv show for 2007. living in Sydney, Australia. We don't get many of the great shows from the US. But having only seen a few episodes, this show is one of the best. I can not wait to see the entire series. CBS please bring it back.",1218931200,4,252,3.9607843137254903
2963482,5,B000W91U6W,I watched the premier episode tonight and I loved it.  Since I am overseas I don't get to see the television shows at the same time as the folks in the USA.  I can't believe they decided to discontinue this SAGA.  It is wonderful and I can't wait to watch the rest of them.,1215907200,4,273,4.018518518518518

2963485,5,B000W91U6W,I cannot begin to express my disappointment at the thought of Cane not returning to CBS this fall.  It was one of the most riveting and well acted shows on television in years.  It seems as though America cannot handle quality shows of substance anymore!  I can only hope that the first season is released soon on DVD.,1212278400,10,318,4.448275862068965
2963486,5,B000W91U6W,"Cane was one of my favorite show last season. This show even made me want to live in Florida with all it's humidity, mosquitos, gators and blue hair old ladies.  No really, this show had a great story, interesting and beautiful characters and the photography and the colors used were stunning.
I was looking forward in seeing season two.  To my great dissapointment the people in suites at CBS decided not to continue the Duque/Vega family saga.  Their BAD! Well, buy the first and only Cane season you won't be disapointed!",1211760000,4,524,4.736263736263736

8221789,5,B000W91U6W,"CBS didn't give this show a chance, and that's a shame!  I found it to be a wonderful series and it's life was cut woefully short! CANE has a superior cast and great writing!  A show this good doesn't come along very often.  It was a big mistake letting it go!",1368316800,,260,4.0588235294117645
8221790,5,B000W91U6W,"I am in the UK and really enjoyed watching this series on digital television.  When it had ended I Googled to see about the second series only to find that there wasn't going to be one.
I find the series to be well-acted, interesting, attractive, pacey and surprising - not things that we always get with US imports.
Sadly, as we are on a different DVD format in the UK to the US, it is unlikely that I will ever be able to watch this again.
What a pity.  And what a pity too that it wasn't continued.  Some reviews seem to be indicating that it was too complex for US audiences (a la 'Murder One'), however it certainly wasn't for us in the UK and I would love to see it continued.",1296950400,,682,4.112781954887218
8221791,5,B000W91U6W,"Beautifully photographed show. The colors and style reminds one of Cuba. The woman are SO pretty. Why CBS would take a series like this off is yet another Television City mistery. If you live in L.A. look for used promo copies DVD's of this series. The ones I saw said ""Coming to CBS this fall"" and will contain at least one full show on the DVD. Jimmy Smits is on the cover leaning on a chair",1290729600,,393,4.184210526315789
8221792,5,B000W91U6W,"I watched just a few episodes of this series.
The drama and story line grabbed my attention like just a few others (24 & The Unit).
It kept me on the edge of my sofa wanting more.
Still today hoping somebody bring it back.
The intrigue of the story, the quality of the writing and acting is so superb, the series will easily last 10 seasons.",1289088000,,341,4.181818181818182
8221793,5,B000W91U6W,"I have read so many wonderful reviews on the series Cane, why is it taking so long to come to dvd, and be made available for public purchase?",1274918400,2,141,4.071428571428571
8221794,5,B000W91U6W,"I absolutely loved this show when it was on the air and was very disappointed when it was canceled.  The show has a great plot, a great setting, and above all, a great cast.  I have been waiting for the DVD for years.  There have been other shows, worse shows, that have been released on DVD after being canceled after just one series.  Now I am just wondering if we are ever going to get it?",1265760000,2,392,4.118421052631579
8221795,5,B000W91U6W,"I rarely watch T.V. however, I knew from the beginning (previews)good! The cast were top quality, beautiful people, and GREAT actors!
I could not wait for the next episode.
I truly appreciated the business aspect of the movie.
Please return...",1252281600,2,243,5.1
8221796,5,B000W91U6W,"What could have been a great hit for CBS was squandered by their corp suits and the writers strike. Too bad as the character of Alex Vega played by Jimmy Smits had the heir apparent of another JR Ewing in the making. An apparent milksoft turned into a calculating killer was just too juicy to pass up. We can only guess how far Alex would have gone to keep the family business from folding.
The supporting cast was top notch and the production value was first rate. The character side stories were being set for a very interesting side-show.
It is highly unlikely that this series will ever be reborn as the actors have all moved on and time can sometimes be unforgiving.
CBS can still make money on the release of the complete series on dvd. But the loss in viewership and a missed opportunity for a hit can only be imagined.",1249084800,2,826,4.405228758169935
8221797,5,B000W91U6W,"Me and my wife have been waiting for this to come out sometime onto dvd,
I still don't get it why the just said oh no more of the show booo, Bring it out again. I wanted more of the show, I guess if people cant understand the shows the networks have to cancel the show, People sure do understand the different shows of csi, csi miami, Csi Ny, what next Csi some place else how about california
Just bring this show out onto dvd just like we have been waiting for hart to hart season 3 come on not blue ray just dvd",1248220800,2,514,3.951923076923077
