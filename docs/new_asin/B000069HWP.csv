7965517,4,B000069HWP,"Although the special effects aren't that great, (you can definitely tell the effects are computerized) this is still a very good movie, good actors, a good plot and plenty of action. I highly recommend it. Four stars given because of the poor FX.",1310860800,,246,4.744186046511628
7965518,2,B000069HWP,"normally,i would say i loved this movie.not for acting,although that
was OK.not for the script,which was so-so.the reason i would have
normally loved this movie is for the intense action,which starts from
the get go and doesn't end until the final credits roll.but,the problem
with this movie,and i felt it was a big problem,was the horrible CGI.it
looks like they ran out of money and couldn't complete the the effects
shots. a lot of the effects look lime they are in their very roughest
form.since it is obvious they didn't have enough money to finish the
movie,they should not have released it.i actual found the effects
insulting.it seems obvious they didn't care about making a decent end
product for the consumer.if it weren't for that,i would give this movie
a much higher rating.my vote for Air Panic is a 1.5/5",1204329600,2,820,4.864285714285714
7965519,5,B000069HWP,"This movie is really great. Very realistic, and the special effects are of the highest possible standard. Looking at the phantastic acting, it made me feel as if I were there myself. I wonder how often this sort of thing actually happens in real life.
Must see! Must buy!!! BUY THIS FANTASTIC GREAT MOVIE!",1192665600,,305,4.666666666666667
7965520,3,B000069HWP,"As a lover of airplane disaster movies, I've seen a wide variety in quality from the worst to the very best. I've seen comedies and parodies. I've seen mediocre and I've seen cliche and I've seen overkill. Now I can say I've seen one with an Identity Crisis. Is it a comedy, a parody? I don't know, but there is something a little off with AIR PANIC, something I can't put my finger on. The premise was good, and it was a good try, and the movie tries to take itself seriously to provide a suspenseful thriller, but with all its sincere attempt, the drama, suspense and terror just isn't there. It held my interest; that much I can say, but nothing more than that. Of course, the most eerie image is at the beginning where a plane crashes into the side of an office building which was created before 9/11, but that's where the unpleasantness ends.

With a similar set-up to the Jaclyn Smith TV-drama ""Freefall,"" AIR PANIC is about the airline industry at the mercy of a psychotic madman who can control actual planes by remote control as if he were a kid playing with a model airplane or video game. He is such a ""genius,"" as he himself claims, he is able to see and hear all that goes on in a plane he has control over, similar to Dennis Hopper's character in the movie ""Speed."" AIR PANIC is not the greatest, but it's not bad either, kind of a campy-flavored airplane disaster movie, despite its sincere attempt, should not be taken seriously. It's kind of like ""candy for the eyes,"" sort of an ""escape from reality"" movie, quite a few notches above the horrible film ""Air Marshal."" Don't let the picture on the cover fool you. It's too heavy-a-tone for such a ""lightly flavored"" movie. My rating? Fair to Midland by way of Industry.",1122508800,2,1735,4.455974842767295
7965521,4,B000069HWP,"B-movies of our time are not all that different from those wonderful B-movies of the 50s and 60s.  Take one hunky hero (Rod Rowlands, a marvelous actor---check out SOULKEEPER); a beautiful airline attendant T3's Kristina Lokken); a nasty nasty villain; a planeload of stereotypical passengers; and throw in some cheesy special effects.  This is AIR PANIC, and I thoroughly enjoyed it for the above reasons.  Also add veteran actors Ted Shackelford and Barbara Carrera, and you know you're in for a good B-flight.
In all honesty, this movie works because it attacks your visceral level of being terrified when the plane you are on goes a little wacky.  Not a cinematic classic, but I found it engrossing and entertaining.",1076371200,,720,5.025210084033613
