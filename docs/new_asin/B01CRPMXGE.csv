8754042,5,B01CRPMXGE,It's a french rom-com.  I liked it.  I would watch it again.  It's light and fun entertainment.  Not sure what others expected but I enjoyed it.,1491523200,,144,4.423076923076923
8754043,4,B01CRPMXGE,No complaints. Would use again.,1485043200,,31,5.4
8754044,4,B01CRPMXGE,"It's a cute romantic comedy, that's all it is. I think people who gave it low reviews, expected too much of it. It's a 2016 movie, but seems older, with almost a ""campy"" quality of truth that plays at parody badly, but knows that's the case, but wants to play, anyway. Everything is portrayed in a light-hearted way, even sex addiction, but there's ""no harm"" meant. I think it conforms to the average idea of what a French romantic comedy ought to be. I thought the main characters were very cute, together, with a certain over-playing of roles that approached parody, but was still cute. Attractive lead actor and actress too. Love conquers all is the motif, no different than a much ""deeper"" and more serious romantic comedy, like ""You've Got Mail."" There's virtually no nudity, certainly no explicit sex. If you want to see a lighthearted, romantic comedy, with sub-titles, then, you're in the right place.",1474416000,,909,4.796178343949045
8754045,2,B01CRPMXGE,"The French have a long tradition of farce and an equally long tradition of sex-positive movies. So you'd think that a lightweight French sex comedy would be funny and refreshing. But for some reason the writer decided to try to create a French sex comedy based on US moeurs. Which means that the lead male character is a ""sex addict"" because he enjoyed sex and had a high sex drive, and the lead female character is someone who ""doesn't respect herself"" because she's a self-confident unashamed adult who likewise enjoys sex. Or to put it another way, the main characters are emotionally stunted with infantile ideas about sexuality that in real life would lead to endless neuroses and permanent unhappiness.

The result is akin to the idea of making a classic 80s Action Hero movie with an introverted skinny male lead who can't handle conflict. Perhaps there's one brief gag in the setup, but that's as much as you can hope for. And with this movie (the real title of which is, ""You want, or you don't want?"") there isn't even one brief gag. It's difficult to understand who the makers of this movie imagined they would appeal to. Contemporary French audiences haven't bought in to US sexual oppression and US audiences don't watch movies in foreign languages. And I doubt that Quebecois would find this a barrel of laughs either. So aside from perhaps a very few people in a few francophone African countries, this is a movie without an audience. It's also a movie without charm, interest, or appeal.

In short, this doesn't reward the effort unless you want to practice your French - there's very little slang, so it's easy for intermediate speakers to follow without the generally poor subtitles.",1466380800,,1701,4.802047781569966
8754046,4,B01CRPMXGE,"This is a charming French romantic comedy, emphasis on comedy, about a nymphomaniac in her mid-thirties who can't keep a job because she keeps sleeping with customers and bosses. She inadvertently winds up in partnership with a guy who is a couples sex therapist, and who is also a sex addict who attends group therapy. The therapist fends off the advances of his new female partner therapist, struggling to learn how to fall in love before having sex. Meanwhile the two provide counseling to a variety of interesting couples - and also learn something new about themselves.

I don't speak French, so I watched with English subtitles - and even with subtitles the movie is very funny, which to me is a substantial accomplishment. The comedic acting is very good, the script is so good it rises into Woody Allen territory, and the production values are terrific with some great locations in France, very good music, and excellent direction.",1465084800,,939,4.90566037735849
8754047,1,B01CRPMXGE,"Between bad acting of both Sophie Marceau and Patrick bruel, the story is a mountain of cliches (( sex with the boss, sex with the therapist, sex frustrations with the mother, tease with the best friend)) zero was not a possibility to bad",1464739200,,238,4.558139534883721
