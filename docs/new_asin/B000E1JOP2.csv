8103875,5,B000E1JOP2,"The Year of the Yao is a documentary that tells the story of Yao Ming's first year in the United States, how he adapted to American basketball, his relationship with his family and teammates, and what his success means to fans in the United States and China. It is narrated by his friend and former interpreter Colin Pine, who stayed with Yao during his rookie year, and interpreted for him for three years.

While the traditional American stereotype of people from China portrays them as short, studious, and not especially athletic, Yao Ming breaks the stereotype considering that he stand seven foot six. He became the most talked about player in professional basketball when he signed to play with the Houston Rockets in 2002. He was largely unknown when he first suited up with the Rockets, and many were skeptical about his abilities, especially when he displayed an unsure command of the American style of basketball in his early games. But he adjusted and worked hard and by the end of the season he was proving his detractors wrong when he emerged as an NBA superstar. Among them player-turned- sportscaster Charles Barkley, who once on air promised to kiss the rear end of one of his fellow television commentators if Yao ever scored 19 points in a game and had to make good on the pledge when Yao managed the feat. Yao's story plays like the stuff of Hollywood fiction, from his disastrous debut to his emergence as a bona-fide NBA superstar of Shaq proportions.

This Yao Ming documentary is the real thing, a satisfying chronicle of the international superstar's tumultuous rookie year. It is doubtful that any NBA player had to withstand the type of scrutiny that the 22- year-old Chinese NBA superstar endured. The first-overall draft pick in 2002, the NBA's first Chinese player was expected to make the Houston Rockets an instant playoff team, though he was unaccustomed to the speed and aggressiveness of American-style basketball. He was also seen as ""a walking advertisement"" and ambassador for expanding China's place on the world stage. Yao carried all the pressure aided immeasurably by Colin Pine, who put off law school to become his interpreter. Historical snapshots of China put Yao's story into cultural context, making it both compelling and entertaining even to those for whom basketball is foreign.",1418256000,,2329,4.969230769230769
8103876,5,B000E1JOP2,"I have watched this movie several times (you can watch it online if you are not sure) and decided to send it to my Dad as his 85th birthday gift.  He is a NBA fan and Yao Ming fan.  I cannot wait to see what a surprise this would bring to him!  One may think that a person's opinion could be a bias, and the movie had people with many different back ground and occupations (coach, teammate, sport journalists, NBA fans, US president, China aembassador...) to give their opinions about Yao Ming---make it a more complete picture about how this man influent NBA, China and US.  Worth every penny!",1378944000,,594,4.422018348623853
8103877,5,B000E1JOP2,"There is no other sports documentary that so well integrates the journey of one man (Colin Pine) through the exploits of another (Yao Ming). This film manages to pull off the feat of portraying the first year of Yao Ming's NBA experience through the eyes, ears, and actions of his personal assistant and interpreter. The Year of Yao addresses such complex issues as globalization, US-China relations, and provides a behind-the-scenes peek into the daily rigors of an NBA player. Pine's narrative is candid and honest, and the viewer gains an appreciation for the pressure Yao contends with on a nightly basis. The documentary is fair, objective, and deserves credit for synthesizing the dynamic world of basketball with relevant cultural topics without becoming overly generalized or banal. In the end, this is a well edited, superbly narrated depiction of two strangers navigating the rookie waters of the world's most popular basketball league.",1265673600,2,946,5.271523178807947
8103878,4,B000E1JOP2,"I watched this documentary in the theatres, and it was an ""upper"" that got your spirits up with suspenseful scenes like the footage of the Yao Ming/Shaq showdowns.  The musical score made it very entertaining making this relaxing, easy viewing.  It was inspiring to see such a young guy like Yao Ming to appear so mentally strong when confronted with so much media attention and other pressures coming from many directions.",1146528000,4,423,4.943661971830986
8103879,5,B000E1JOP2,"After reading Jeffery Mingo's review, my first impression is that  the world is getting better but still exists racism. If it is really ""an entirely African-American team"", does that mean white people are really so weak and can't make the team? I feel it's not about race. It's about peace of love without boundaries of race, country and culture. ""When you want to know your neighbors, first reach your neighbors.""",1144368000,3,414,4.914285714285715
