It is very peaceful and enjoyable, even for a beginner. I am happy to say that I am very happy with the DVD and will certainly recommend it!

5183179,1,B008UEQ5HU,Disappointing. Way too much time spent in mantras not enough time spent doing yoga. Wish I would have known it was so mantra heavy...I would have passed on this purchase.,1357603200,,170,4.7
5183180,5,B008UEQ5HU,"I have the privilege of practicing yoga with Bethany in person and love her teaching style. That said, it wasn't always easy to get to class while I was pregnant. When I first got pregnant I had the best intentions to take care of myself by cooking, going to yoga, resting, meditating a lot, but I was working full time and balancing all of it was harder than I thought. This DVD gave me access to all that I love about Bethany's class without having to actually make it in person. I could do it on my own time in my own living room. This yoga helped me stay strong, flexible, and grounded during my pregnancy and I felt it was THE THING I was doing for myself and my baby that covered so many categories at once- body, mind, spirit. Love it and will continue to suggest this to others.",1356912000,,786,4.211920529801325
5183181,5,B008UEQ5HU,"I used Bethany's Prenatal Yoga DVD throughout my entire pregnancy up until the day I delivered. My 4 year old son also enjoyed doing it with me on his yoga mat. He even learned all the chants! Bethany mixes a beautiful blend of meditative, restorative prenatal yoga with a good workout. I found the sequence to be very grounding and spiritual while at the same time making me feel like I really used my body. This DVD really helped me stay in shape during my pregnancy and prepare my mind, heart and body for labor. I usually find Prenatal Yoga to be boring and this was not!

5183182,5,B008UEQ5HU,"This DVD ended up being a cornerstone of my health and well-being during my pregnancy. Not only is it a terrific workout that prepared me for birth and soothed the aches and pains of pregnancy, but it addressed the spiritual side of being a new mama and helped me to bond with a baby I couldn't yet see or hold. I have recommended this DVD to all my pregnant girlfriends and will continue to do so. Happy to see it's finally available on Amazon!",1348617600,,445,4.309523809523809
8530503,4,B008UEQ5HU,"Good stretch, but wished there's more ""work out"" in the vid. --  do agree with the other reviewer, the signing towards the end runs way too long, I can see this as a good meditation / zen retreat at home type of stuff, def. putting up some candles and flowers next time. But I'm still looking for a solid prenatal yoga vid where I can get the workout I need.",1428278400,,358,4.114285714285714
8530504,3,B008UEQ5HU,"The poses were good. I am not completely comfortable with Sanskrit mantras, and this instructor used them quite a bit. I could do it again with some fast forwarding. I would enjoy something less Naam orthodox.",1427932800,,209,4.833333333333333
8530505,5,B008UEQ5HU,"Love Bethany's class and I am excited to be able to take her home with me!
Connect with Baby and empower Momma for birth.
Perfect for 1st timers, or those who have been practicing for years and are second generation prenatal yoga lovers!
Great all the way THROUGH my due date.",1424131200,,276,4.431372549019608
8530506,2,B008UEQ5HU,She sang for so long I had to fast forward through parts.  The yoga was good but I couldn't do the video again due to all the singing expressions that I didn't know the meaning to.,1418428800,,180,4.0
8530507,5,B008UEQ5HU,"I'm really sore after doing it one time, but it wasn't hard to do. It felt good and all the poses seemed like things my body needs to be doing right now.",1414540800,2,153,3.8125
8530508,5,B008UEQ5HU,"Exactly what I was looking for. I wanted to find a more spiritual approach to yoga practice, not just exercise. This DVD was perfect. Chanting was an important part of it. You'll find also a meditation on a mantra.",1412121600,3,214,4.512820512820513
8530509,5,B008UEQ5HU,"I used this DVD throughout my pregnancy, and found it to be a perfect blend of yoga and meditation. The yoga portion helped me to stay in shape and feel physically strong for my upcoming labor and delivery, and the meditation helped to calm my pregnancy nerves and helped me to approach my labor and delivery with a sense of peace. After the birth of my daughter, I have used this DVD to ease back into yoga, and the meditation is great for helping me find calm in my new role as a mother. I have taken Bethany's classes, and she put the same amount of love and thought into this DVD as she does into every one of her classes. I would definitely recommend this DVD!",1405900800,,665,4.244094488188976
8530510,5,B008UEQ5HU,"I hope to be pregnant soon and have thoroughly enjoyed practicing daily with this DVD. It allows me to tune in, become centered, and begins and ends my day with peace of mind and heart due to the beautiful meditations and movements.  My body feels more open, especially my back and hips. I highly recommend it! I have bought this DVD for several of my prego friends!",1404604800,,366,4.462686567164179
8530511,1,B008UEQ5HU,"This is the worst DVD ever, it has no real relevance and you cant even understand her ""mantras"".  Buy something else, anything else!",1402963200,,132,4.739130434782608
8530512,5,B008UEQ5HU,"Insightful and instructive! The instructor exudes a beautiful vibe and great love for her body, unborn baby and yoga. Namasta",1398297600,,125,5.3
