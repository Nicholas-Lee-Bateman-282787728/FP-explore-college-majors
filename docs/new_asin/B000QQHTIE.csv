8196785,5,B000QQHTIE,"The master of horror has returned! This is a 10 movie collection for only about $6, but the movies are great! I am a major critic of Bela, he has some really awesome movies that I judge his other movies by, but 5 of my all time favorite movies by Bela are in this collection alone! The other movies are great also, but it is very very rare to find a cheap movie collection that has more than one great movie, let alone 5/10 then the other 5 are still great.

The DVDs are of great quality, no silly logos on the screen, DVD menus for both DVDs, plays fine in anything but my ps3 (because ps3 and xbox 360 have strange DVD reading lasers meant for reading games primarily). The sound is great too and the picture is awesome, even on my widescreen LCD 32"" Samsung. No real stretching or pixelation. I own a few other horror movies packs, and one has 100 movies for $19.99 and I like only 4 of the movies. So as you can see, this is a great movie collection.

Bela's acting skills far exceed Vincent Price, Boris Karloff and others of his horror day, sad to say however, that producers lost out  during the depression and he was forced out into a new production team and made these movies, less special effects (not like they are up to standards here in 2011 anyway) and more reliance on his acting abilities, which actually made these movies better!

Enjoy the movies, they are all great!",1303862400,2,1386,4.319230769230769
8196786,5,B000QQHTIE,"This collection is a great way to own some of Bela Lugosi's B movies from the 30's, 40's and 50's. The films are very good quality and the price for this collection cannot be beaten. Pick this one up if you are looking for some lesser known  horror favorites featuring Bela Lugosi",1270425600,4,280,4.384615384615385
8196787,4,B000QQHTIE,"Born Bla Ferenc Dezs Blask in Hungary in 1882, Bela Lugosi created his most renowned role of Count Dracula on stage in 1927. The 1931 movie version brought Lugosi worldwide fame, but also typecast him.

His inability to speak fluent English, a rivalry with Boris Karloff and a regime change at UNIVERSAL all worked against Lugosi. Consigned to small roles in 'B' pictures, he never again enjoyed the success of DRACULA. A severe bout of sciatica led to drug addiction.

By the early 1950's Lugosi was all but forgotten and living in near-poverty. His career revived briefly when Ed Wood located him and urged Lugosi to appear in some low-budget films. After a stint in drug rehab, he died of a heart attack on August 16, 1956 and was buried in one of his stageplay Dracula capes.

The ten titles in BELA LUGOSI: MASTER OF HORROR are all from his 'B' picture days. The most famous one here is WHITE ZOMBIE. There is also a serial that has been recut to movie length (THE PHANTOM CREEPS).
