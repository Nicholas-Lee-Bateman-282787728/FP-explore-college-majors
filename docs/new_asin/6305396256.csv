7888530,5,6305396256,"""The Cybernauts"" is the quintessential Avengers episode, the most famous of the series and deservedly so.  If you're new to the series, this is the best story to start out on.  It has all the elements the show became so famous for  -  science-fictional story, a flamboyantly bizarre evil mastermind, good suspense, and playful banter between the two principals.  Michael Gough is an electronics whiz, who kills off his competition by means of one of his lesser inventions  -  a simple steel robot named ""Roger,"" who he releases as a guided missile.  How the robot homes in on its target is more the mystery than the fact that a robot is responsible for the killings.  This episode works in every way, except that the early red-herring of trying to blame a karate expert isn't much of a red-herring, today  -  but even that gives Mrs. Peele an excuse to strut her stuff in the dojo.  Gough is famous for playing evil English cads, and is at his best, here.  The robots (yes, there is more than one) are brilliantly designed in minimalist fashion, making them all the creepier.
""Death At Bargain Prices"" is also one of the better Avengers entries, with Steed and Mrs. Peele investigating a curious murder at a department store, which they suspect may have something to do with a missing atomic scientist  -  of course, they're right.  Why is a missing atomic scientist connected to a department store murder?  Well, that's the fun of finding out, then, isn't it?  With special guest cameo appearances by Yogi Bear and Doctor Who's arch-enemies, the Daleks.  A good time is to be had by all.
Rush to your local murdered agent missing atomic scientist department store, and buy this double-great tape, double-quick.",1020038400,,1711,4.778156996587031
