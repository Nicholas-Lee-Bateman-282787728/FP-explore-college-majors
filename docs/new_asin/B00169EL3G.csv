8261726,4,B00169EL3G,"In ""Dos de Abajo"" (""Two From the Bottom"") from 1983, two of Mexico's biggest stars of the time---Andres Garcia and Valentin Trujillo: were day-laborers who got into a heap of trouble when they accidentally came upon stolen gold coins on a construction site. The beautiful Blanca Guerra and Patricia Rivera held their own as their girlfriends and future wives (almost all Mexican comedies end with a wedding), who came to their rescue and put them on the ""straight and narrow"". The film was full of the vulgar jokes and situations that we have come to expect from this subgenre. There was some brief female-nudity (rear-end shots of the beautiful Blanca Guerra and Patricia Rivera), which is still better than none. Overall, a fairly decent comedy from Mexico. Grupo Nueva Imagen did an excellent job on the restoration and transfer. Spanish (no English subtitles), NTSC, NR 112 mins. Spanish proficiency and Mexican slang required too!

Love and Peace,
