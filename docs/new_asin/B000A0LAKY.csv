8189129,3,B000A0LAKY,Film wasn't that great. Story is fine.,1474848000,,38,4.571428571428571
8189130,3,B000A0LAKY,It was a fair wholesome movie.  Not much more to say.  It held my attention while I worked and I can't ask much more than that.,1468454400,,127,3.8461538461538463
8189131,5,B000A0LAKY,"Dr. Christian is worried about the people living in shanty town and the diseases that are breaking out there. He works to get land donated to build community housing for them, against the efforts of the rest of those on the town council. Once their requirements are met, they change their stand and try to have the people from shanty town run out of the city. But when an epidemic breaks out and Dr. Christian has to quaranteen the whole area, the towns people see the suffering of the people and the tireless work of Dr. Christian and his nurse, and their hearts are changed. The very people who were trying to run them out of town now work to provide for those in need. Precious story of how the actions of one person can change the heart of an entire town!",1396569600,,759,4.352112676056338
8189132,5,B000A0LAKY,"Great for the whole family. Very thought provoking. Many life lessons. Seeing 'the other side' and learning to bend a little to gain a whole lot of goodness for many folks. Persevering kindness changes bad attitudes to good. Changes negative to positive. Beware what examples one is setting to pass on to the next go around! It is all here, and more, in this wonderful program. Where are our doctors in 2013? It used to be they would make housecalls! It is good to have a good balance - the doc needed more help and rest, yet we do sometimes need them to come to us. Praise God folks cared enough to get some good housing for folks.
  One realized there were folks 'down' a bit, from depression time, etc. [Maybe a bit like our last few years of 'storm' time - economical and natural!] The talented man who was probably - or could be - an architect! I was hoping they would expound on the story and use his designs and that would give him an income and get things going in the right direction! That is all it takes, then and now!
  I did miss the show not showing any side to praying or looking to the Lord [except Doc a bit], yet that is where the real credit is due for folks turning around and facing what is right in front of them. God does use His 'servants' such as Dr. Christian to get a point across!  You won't be sorry to watch this, and it may give a few pointers for this life we go thru even now!",1362873600,5,1409,4.165441176470588
8189133,5,B000A0LAKY,"For a short film, there is a lot of stuff to think about here. Set at teh end of the Great Depression and before World War II you get to see small town life as peole struggle to get food on the table and make it day to day.

Yet, it's not all serious. Teh director made the wise choice of putting in a good deal of comedy and some romance so we are not left totally beaten down by the end.

Overall it makes you think about the world today and how far we've come and how man is man's best friend.",1146787200,4,496,3.8058252427184467
