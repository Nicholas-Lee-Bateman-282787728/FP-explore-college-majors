7365594,3,B013HOZJ74,"A simple synopsis in that an Italian boy is a swimmer and has to go to Russia for a swimming competition and when he gets there he meets the translator  Vladimir  and they hit it off and that grows into love.

It is also a tale of homophobia in Russia and is interwoven with an old silent film; said film is part of this production but made to look aged. The themes are eternal love and parallels with love of both straight and gay people  in that we are all the same. The downsides are that it takes its time and this is on purpose  sometimes coming across as a travelogue with arty and very poetic shots and then getting back to the story. The two men are good but we do not get a real sense of how the magic happened and there is very little real chemistry.

Also no bedroom action to speak of and it is also a short film at around 70 minutes, but because of the slow pacing it actually felt longer. So a film with an important message that may have been lost in translation. This films original title was ""Non accettare i sogni dagli sconosciuti"" and it is also known as Water Boys. One for rental only as there is nothing here to gain from a second viewing which is a shame as there are a lot of good ideas here but it fails to be an equal to the sum of its parts.",1450483200,3,1269,4.035856573705179
7365595,3,B013HOZJ74,"The filmmaker has attempted to infuse his love story with poetic and philosophical language, but the film fails to engage, despite two beautiful young actors. One line from the film--""Respect comes from the brain, hate [comes] from the heart""--will remain with me, but, sadly, the director does not have a story to tell. I applaud the intent behind cinema such as ""Dreams From Strangers,"" and I continue to appreciate Amazon's streaming options.",1450051200,2,445,5.194444444444445

Like any great short story, it has an amazing end.
A little too much of the vintage films.",1531353600,,121,4.083333333333333
8727771,3,B013HOZJ74,"I saw this movie when it was first released and loved it. Then I was surprised by all the negative reviews I read, until I saw this film. The film I saw was much longer and contained so many scenes not shown in this movie. No wonder people didn't like it. I don't like this short version. I wonder what happened to the original full length film???",1526169600,,347,4.1940298507462686

8727775,1,B013HOZJ74,fell asleep during all the commentary that does not relate to the movie and the cut ins that make no sense. Made it through 33% of the movie and received about 2 minutes of actual movie experience. Could not watch anymore.,1505174400,,222,4.439024390243903
8727776,2,B013HOZJ74,"This is one of those movies I think you are either going to love or hate.  Unfortunately, I didn't like it...way too artsy for my taste.  I tried to keep an open mind, but the beginning sequence of of the drive along a long windy road, while it was beautiful...it was boring..same with the old movie flashbacks.  I will say that was nicer than the usually tea kettle whistling or the train horn blowing that so many other writer/directors use to fill space that due to lack of dialogue.  Felt like a college film project to me.

If you like more ""artsy"" type films, you may love this...if not, you may want to skip it.",1496793600,,618,4.339130434782609

8727778,1,B013HOZJ74,I can't tell you. It might be good if you understand Italian. There's no English track or subtitles.,1477872000,,100,4.611111111111111
8727779,3,B013HOZJ74,"There is a beautiful poetry to this film, but it has a rather thin plot: boy meets boy, falls in love, can't be with him because he lives in Italy and the other lives in Russia where they hate gay people.  I wish the film had been more about the Russian character trying to find a way to be free or to be happy despite the roadblocks of the Russian government.  There was a big story there and it wasn't explored.  There are only a handful of scenes that depict the relationship and they are sweet, but most of the film is filler: pretty scenery takes of a good portion of the film and for some reason an awful lot of silent film footage that is supposed to mirror the relationship is inserted, but doesn't add anything to the experience.  The two actors are cute together, so it left me wanting a lot more and it is surprising what a lost opportunity this film turns out to be.",1457740800,4,878,4.208333333333333
