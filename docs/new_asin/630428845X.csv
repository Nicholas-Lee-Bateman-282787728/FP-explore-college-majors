834904,4,630428845X,"Why you shouldn't watch this: If you are a newcomer to the Halloween franchise, are excited after watching the original HI (78) and HII (81), and expecting to find out about Strode, Loomis, and Myers after the Halloween night's/early morning's killing spree, you'll be let down. Nothing to see here, move along to the solid Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers. But beware! Even if it is a completely separate story, HIII is the last Halloween to capture that early 1980s foreboding, bleak atmosphere, and synth score. After this we're talking MTV-era influence. (Although I must give a shout out to H4's opening which maintains the spirit Carpenter created.)

Coming out in 82, we still had about 2 more years before the Regan-era of excess truly took off. We're still thinking ""Are the Soviets going to invade us? The future is bleak! And man we're still recovering from Vietnam/Nixon/Carter failures - we're going to run out of oil permanently! We don't trust anyone!""

So, this movie screams that bleakness, just like Carpenter's other hits. It's got a great, severely underrated cast, story, and score. Suspend belief, and immerse yourself into the mysterious lore of the Halloween Holiday season! What does Halloween really represent? Why do we celebrate it? Why did the pagans celebrate it? What does All Hallows' Eve really mean in its most evil form?  Well, let this movie play out, and don't take it too seriously.

If Carpenter and co had marketed this as ""Carpenter's Halloween Stories: Season of the Witch"" the whole anthology concept might have taken off. Instead, people went in asking about Michael Myers, and were perplexed by one Dr. Daniel Challis, played by Tom Atkins (who plays this role and many others with his usual zest and understanding of the fun material). Legend has it, that if this was successful, at least two other films would have been made? A potential Carpenter werewolf movie? Yes please! And then, the demon/haunting of Micahel Myers / or the town's paranoia to set up his return? Yes! Unfortunately it wasn't to be.

Suggestion: Create your own Halloween Anthology, by watching Halloween III, Christine, and then Prince of Darkness in that order.",1501718400,4,2190,4.989041095890411

835032,3,630428845X,"Why is this movie so watchable?  Because it is what might happen in the future.  In the 80's, 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek' movies were science fiction, but if you watch Science Channel now, you learn a lot of that fiction has become fact 30 or so years later.  Robots were fiction in 'Halloween III'.  Now they are everywhere.  If rumba cleaning robot accidentally kills someone, then we have got a problem.  I am looking forward to certain  Robots that can play Boggle with me though.  How about microchips in the mask?  I bet those are out there too.  Nanotechnology.  You betcha.  Humans sometimes like to play God.  This has been the case for eons.  Some humans are not crazy, but still do crazy things.  Some humans are crazy and also do crazy things.  I think the movie shows crazy and non crazy people and robots all placed together to see what would happen for our enjoyment.  Because the movie is escapist fare, it is enjoyable.  But the real world 2017 and beyond might be the scariest and craziest moments of our lives.  Hang on for the ride that is future technology, for better or worse.",1498608000,2,1099,4.51530612244898

835035,3,630428845X,"Halloween III is one of these films I saw in the theater during it's very brief release. It's also been a film I have watched evolve into this kind of cult classic for reasons that are just as fascinating as the direction Carpenter and Debra Hill decided to go in an attempt to reboot the series back in 1983.

At the time of it's release, Halloween III was a major disappointment and made the bulk of it's total gross opening weekend before everyone deserted this badly timed departure in the series. Fans had expected more from Michael Myers, but instead received this bizarre tale about Halloween masks that had more plot holes than in Myer's bullet-laced body.  As a story it offers an interesting twist to the dark side of Halloween and it's traditions. But as a movie I have to be honest and say it's very much a standard 80's horror film that would have been lost to time with the countless other horror films in it's genre if not for it's association with the Halloween franchise.

Tom Atkins, while quite amiable as an actor, is an odd choice to play the lead role here. His character's motivations are pretty shallow if not completely unethical as he blows off his family (armed with a six pack) to chase after a young skirt who is trying to solve a mystery murder. Tom Atkins is such a likable and unassuming actor it's easy, if not funny, to look past his nonstop flirts with current and former love interests. It's almost like trying to make Don Knotts into a male whore. I'm not buying what I see here, but I begrudgingly accept it to advance the plot.

The technology and general abilities regarding the human-like robots is all over the place here. In one scene they can be seen ripping a head off a helpless victim with minimal effort, but in another scene the robot has trouble strangling Atkin's character when he has him straddled on the ground, hands firmly around Atkin's neck, and essentially dead to rights.

The ""tragic-but horny"" Ellie (played by Stacey Nelkin) is essentially eye candy here. She's a cute looking girl, but her motivations are equally bizarre. She's a rambunctious little tiger, looking to solve her dad's murder, but the trail is so painfully clear, it begs to ask why the police were not already looking that direction. Its fascinating how quickly she can get in over her head, but shows absolutely no sign of struggle once the robots capture her. The factory quickly whips up their version of her as a robot and she quickly illustrates how she is both super strong and flimsy all at the same time. There's been speculation that perhaps she was always a robot, to explain away the turn around time in making her, but I don't buy that.

First, it makes no sense to create a robot to bring attention to the very place that is orchestrating the crimes. Second, the horny doctor made love to her, which I would think might reveal a seam or two in her construction given the fragile nature of their design once you punch them. I can imagine nailing one might be a tad harder on the system. Then we have the primary villain in all of this - Conal Cochran (played nicely by Dan O'Herlihy).

It goes without saying had this film not had an engaging actor to flush out a bit of mystery and villainy as Dan O'Herlihy does here, we would have had a complete snoozer for a story. He perhaps plays the only convincing part in the entire film, although his motivations, like everyone else, is bizarre at best and silly at worst. While the core of the film is thankfully anchored to his delivery, his ultimate plan to revive witch craft through killing kids is an odd ambition given his vague origins and even stranger exit from the film. Is he killed? I have no idea. But one would think if the rocks taken from StoneHenge were destroyed at the headquarters (along with the computers that guided the micro pieces in the masks), there would be no threat remaining when the commercial ran that evening. If the argument is the chips work independent, then why are the computers running the program at the headquarters that consume and destroy the source of the witchcraft?

I'm sure there are a few rationales that might fit. The problem is they are not presented in the film. So, like everything in this story, we are left to accept the events as they unfold without a great deal of reason as to why they should. And really that is the whole film in a nutshell. I don't see any tremendous story arc that somehow uniquely captures the themes of Halloween any better than most films on the subject. So I think what keeps it in the conversation is the simple fact it is the oddity in the Halloween franchise. Had it not been a part of this franchise, it most likely would have been lost to the sands of time along with so many other b-rated horror films of it's day.

I certainly wouldn't argue it's merits to those who like the film for what it is. But I would highly question those who try to make it into something it never was (or can be). I also think its easier to offer added praise to a film like this that did not get sucked into the exhausting narrative of a lengthy franchise where the same story keeps getting retooled and rebooted about Myers. So from that standpoint alone, it gets an easy out for just being different. But if the story was about donkeys that flew on Halloween night, it would still get the same kind of praise just for being different.",1492473600,5,5393,4.500510725229827
835036,4,630428845X,"It was pretty good. I only have two complaints.

835037,5,630428845X,6 more days till Halloween silver shamrock.

Very creepy story of witchcraft and corporate brainwashing!,1488931200,,255,4.906976744186046
835038,3,630428845X,"Stylistically similar to the first two films, it differs due to its central plot device, which plays out like an episode from The Twilight Zone. Halloween 3 is the worst film in the franchise. But this is a matter of perspective, not because it's poorly made or even a bad film, but because Michael Myers is nowhere in sight. As a stand alone anthology film, (which the filmmakers intended) its a deliciously peculiar piece of work destined for cult status.

Even though the ending has some logic issues (someone calling 3 networks to cancel a commercial and having it stopped) was a head scratcher. It still is a great little horror flick.",1480896000,2,431,4.986111111111111
835170,4,630428845X,"I don't think people give this film enough credit.

835174,4,630428845X,"Halloween III is a good horror film in itself, but has nothing to do with the first two, nor any of the subsequent Halloween films in the franchise, so it shouldn't have been released as part of it. I believe the film's star, Tom Atkins, has said so, too. That being said, even without Michael Myers or the haunting 5/4-time Halloween theme, this one stands on its own merits.

A madman, who owns a company called Silver Shamrock Novelties, that makes (seemingly ONLY THREE) Halloween masks, wants to, for whatever reason, destroy all the kids in the world ....or at least those who can get their parents to buy them a Silver Shamrock mask. At 9:00 PM on Halloween night, the kids are told to be at their televisions, wearing their Silver Shamrock masks (one of only three they have to choose from), and get ready for the ""big giveaway."" What they will get instead is a (probably literal) splitting headache and lots of creepy crawleys coming from their cranial orifices. An interesting footnote here is that Silver Shamrock is in the fictional town of Santa Mira, California, a popular fictional town that has provided the setting for quite a few notable horror and sci-fi films over the years.

Tom Atkins is great as Dr. Challis, the physician who was on duty the night the first causality of the story is brought in to the hospital. He becomes the film's hero, setting out to get to the bottom of the bizarre murder. Of course, it first takes a little prompting from the film's heroine and daughter of the murdered man, played by the lovely Stacey Nelkin. Stacey has a real Pat Benatar thing going on (who was very musically relevant in 1982), so no more is needed to say as to why I give her high marks in this one. (You also might want to check out Stacey as the girl dancing with Mick Jagger's coat in Bette Midler's ""Beast of Burden"" music video.) Dan O'Herlihy as Conal Cochran, the madman behind Silver Shamrock Novelties, is superb. His soothing graciousness almost completely masks his underlying insanity. Near the end of the film, Mr. Cochran gives his reasoning for his evil scheme to a captive Dr. Challis, but it's far too vague to give the viewer any sort of ""ah, so that's why""  revelation. The rest of the cast are top notch in their performances. The only nods to the first two Halloween movies here are Nancy Loomis (who went from the role of a teenager to a 30-something mom in a span of just four years) in a small role as Dr. Challis' wife and the (uncredited) voice of Jamie Lee Curtis as the Santa Mira curfew announcer and telephone operator.

If you've purchased all the Halloweens DVDs in the franchise and want to see them all in order, skip this one and view it afterwards. Halloween III is good, but it just has nothing to do with the rest of the Halloween films. Besides Mr. Cochran's cryptic explanation as to why he wants to destroy all the kids who'll put on one of his company's (only three) masks on Halloween night, the only other thing that will make you scratch your head about this one will be ....why a company of that size and technological capability makes ONLY THREE masks.",1479513600,,3120,4.55614973262032
835175,4,630428845X,"Well, I liked it, it was original from the start. It does have a plot. So, all you haters out there saying it doesn't you obviously did not watch it to find out. Carpenter and Debra Hill wanted to make more Halloween style type movies with original ideas. (SPOILER ALERT) They did not plan on making any more after Michael got ""burned"" at the end of Halloween II, if Heaven forbid anyone has not seen this movie by now.
So, with that in mind they did not want to continue the Michael ""theme"". They underestimated what they had created in two movies with Jamie Lee and Donald Pleasance.
So, it probably wasn't a good idea to attach the ""III"" to the Title. Hence, fans of the first two were thinking, ahhh, here we go, he isn't dead as we all thought him to be. Wrong. It's a completely new original idea and a great idea it was. Don't go looking for Oscar night performances here, there are some good scenes and the leading lady is quite lovely to look at, Stacey Nelkin. She is still gorgeous after all these years in the ""Making Of.."" that is on this Special Edition.
I loved the setting of it throughout the movie, the music, everything.
The Special Features are great, too. They are described above in detail, but I loved the ""Making Of"" the best.
Horror's Hallowed Grounds is a fun look at the locations for these movies and what they look like today. Very cool!
I was 16 when this came out and saw it on cable TV many times.
** I look at this as a type of spinoff. Much like that of Friday the 13th, part V. There has to be more Halloween type of movies out there other than that of the killer Michael Myers.

  I think this movie gets a lot of hate just because Myers isn't in it but I like the original story of an evil Irish mask masker here to trick the children. The guy is Irish and that is cool. I am Irish and I thought the Irish villain did a great job. The Final Girl acting alongside Tom Atkins did a great acting job too.

  There were good twists and turns in this movie. There is never a dull moment in this movie. I never got bored. I really don't get the poor reviews. But you have to be a judge for yourself.

Halloween III however is not worth seeing more than once, and even to watch it once should only be to satisfy your curiosity. The story is completely obsurd... It makes no sense and doesn't have any worthwhile connection to the other movies. Basically a wealthy businessman who is getting rich from selling Halloween masks and novelties, uses some kind of witchcraft to try to kill millions of children. Um, what??? At least with Michael Myers as the villain they explain that he basically has no conscience which is why he has no problem killing people. With the villain in Halloween III, he's just a rich guy, who for no good reason kills his customers! I can't get over how ridiculous it is.

835902,4,630428845X,"A stand alone horror flick misfiled as part of the Halloween series.  If you can get past the disappointment that this film is NOT about Michael Myers, it's not that bad.  The plot features a diabolical scheme to murder as many children as they can with sabotaged masks set to activate at 9:00 PM.  Of course, time zones being uncooperative to such a scheme..............
The villain of the piece is Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy).  He steals part of Stonehenge and transports it to California, to a super-secret lab/factory where the killer masks are manufactured by his skilled team of androids.  A doctor (Tom Atkins) accidentally discovers this conspiracy of witchcraft and with the help of a sidekick (Stacey Nelkin as Ellie Grimbridge) they try to thwart the scheme by whatever means necessary.

As schlocky 80's horror flicks go, it does the job of providing some suspense and some interest, even if the logic of time and TV reception proves problematic.  How would you ""time"" such an event to happen simultaneously around the world?  What about countries that don't celebrate Halloween and therefore wouldn't buy tainted masks?  What if people didn't like the limited choices in said masks: a skull, a witch face, and a pumpkin head!?  What if they couldn't afford them?
If you're planning to take over the world, you need to come up with a better plan than this.

836061,5,630428845X,"I am a fan of the original Halloween 1978, the subsequent Halloween Myers sequels are hit and miss.

Halloween III: Season Of The Witch was a Halloween movie that I instantly fell in love with when I saw it back in the 80s on cable and is a MUST WATCH for me EVERY October 31st without fail.

There really aren't many cool horror movies that actually deal with the holiday of Halloween itself as a means for the story. There will always be the avid Myers fans that hate this movie because it's not about him and he is not in it, except for the fun and cheesy commercials promoting the original Halloween 1978 as the TV movie of the night for Halloween and then ""Be sure to tune in for  'The Big Give Away' At 9...""

To the avid Myers fans I say there are copious Halloween Michael Myers sequels (and remakes) readily available, with high accumulative body counts, so feel free to delve in to those as needed for your Michael Myers fix.

Halloween III: Season Of The Witch represents a fun and entertaining look at the Halloween holiday from a fresh perspective with witchcraft and trickery at it's core, leaving the heavily trod slasher ground behind, thankfully. If you can wrap your mind around a Halloween horror film about Halloween and not a slasher movie I think you're bound to have fun and enjoy the ride!

Halloween III: Season Of The Witch is a great little Halloween horror movie about Halloween. Personally I can't imagine October 31st without popping the Blu Ray disc in my player and singing along 'Six more days to Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Six more days to Halloween Silver Shamrock!! Yay!!

:-)

The Technical presentation of Scream Factory's Blu Ray release offers a decent video transfer and the 2.0 DTS HD Master Lossless audio track is ample but nothing special. There is no doubt Halloween III: Season of the Witch could use a nice video restoration and 5.1 lossless audio remix but I think that maybe asking too much.

I would normally say that this Scream Factory Blu Ray edition is as good as it's going to get for this film; but alas, Universal is releasing their Blu Ray version of this film in a few months so it will be interesting to see if they do some sort of more extensive video and audio restoration or if there will be any new and worthwhile supplements. I have no idea what the Universal release will be like but if they're using the same transfer as the Scream Factory I don't see any reason to buy Universal's Blu Ray version unless you're a nerd complete-ist (like me) or perhaps there are some revelatory bonus content or lost footage, which seems doubtful.

The bonus content on this Scream Factory BRD release are quite good. The interviews, commentary tracks and Horror's Hallowed Grounds episode are fun and super entertaining. Fans of this film should be pleased with Scream Factory's BRD release of Halloween III: Season of the Witch.",1432080000,6,2888,4.634050880626223

But up until I picked up the box set I had completely written off season of the witch as a huge mistake.  I watched it once years ago just to be able to say I've watched them all. But I went in with a bad attitude and the ever popular ignorant mindset of 'oh Michael Myers isn't in this it has to stink'. And that's exactly how I walked away from it and never watched it again. Fast forward all these years to the release of the box set and after doing my research on why Michael Myers wasn't the killer and John Carpenter's original intent for the franchise I watched it again with a much more open mind. And boy was I wrong, this movie is great. I won't trouble you with a whole synopsis that you can look up yourself but just understand its executed perfectly. This film is more worthy of the title of the franchise than any of the others as it completely focuses on the occasion. The villain is just as emotionless as Michael Myers was only hes not hiding behind a mask to make the presentation easier. If John Carpenter went through with his original intention to make the Halloween franchise a different story with different characters in every entry it would be considered a huge classic by now and not lumped in to the likes of Freddy and Jason. Its tragic that this movie didn't get the attention it deserved, with much luck the people who own it with box set will give it a second chance.",1413849600,5,1575,4.320945945945946

At least H3 has the same feel as Carpenter's Halloween, The Fog, and Halloween 2.....a great score and atmospheric.
With the anthology idea, there were a variety of fresh ideas that the series could have pursued- probably with Carpenter's continued participation as well. And it wasn't like they couldn't have revisited Haddonfield in some future installment as well. I loved Halloween  and H2, but the story was over.....however, H3 was poorly marketed at the time, the movie wasn't all that great, and people were going to the theater still believing it was a Michael Myers movie. All this contributed to H3 bombing and any ideas of proceeding with the anthology idea for the Halloween series went down the tubes with it.

836580,5,630428845X,"First of all, obviously, Michael Myers has nothing to do with this movie.  If you want to see Michael Myers, there are 9 other movies that have him in it, and two of them are actually good.  Think of the title ""Halloween"" more as ""John Carpenter Presents"" (he was a producer and did the music, but did not direct) as opposed to meaning the storyline is going to follow any certain characters.  People who are capable of doing that, and getting past the fact that it's not about The Shape, usually find themselves enjoying a classic 80's sci-fi techno-horror.

As for the Blu Ray itself, it's really great.  There isn't an abundance of special features, but the ones you get are really great.  The retrospective documentary is entertaining/interesting, and the featurette that revisits the old shooting locations (with director Tommy Lee Wallace joining in when the presenter gets to Santa Mira) is really great.  Other than that there ares some stills and some TV spots, and a couple of commentaries I think.  But it's just enough special features for me.  When it comes to picture, how good a transfer is and all that, I'm not really the person to talk to.  I'm not an A/V expert, I just know this Blu Ray looks and sounds great to me.

Bottom line is, if you're a fan, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this ""Silver Shamrock Edition"", it's a well-prepared Blu Ray.  Compared to many movies released in recent years, you can really tell some care/love went into this.

wanted to stray away from the Myers motif afterwards. The fans did not

appreciate the absence of Michael in #3, so the franchise went back to Michael.

In my honest opinion, if you forget that this is called HALLOWEEN 3, this is

an excellent and underappreciated as well as highly underrated picture.

Tom's performance as a not so good husband/father with alcohol issues is

excellent in my personal opinion. The lead lady not so much however...

836586,5,630428845X,"Irwin Yablans really wants fans to know that, when they pick up their weapons and come after the creators of this movie, that he had absolutely NOTHING to do with its creation! Okay, then he's a simpleton. ""Halloween 3"" is brilliant, the only one of this rather disreputable series that I enjoy. Talk about a case of money-grubbing greed and ignorance supplanting an opportunity for genuine artistic integrity. I'm not delusional, I know how this capitalism thing works (and, ironically, the film seems to be satirizing consumerist gullibility as well). But the fact that the franchise was moved from its ""Night Gallery""/""Thriller"" destination of presenting nifty anthology stories in a new Halloween-themed tale for every subsequent new film just breaks my heart. For those who think it's silly and superfluous to argue so passionately about films, consider the kind of intellectual hijacking that occurred during the production of this series. It makes me ill. ""Halloween 3"" is, for me, the only quality entry in this series, and the only one that truly understands that horror and satire must work hand-in-hand to make a genuine reproduction, like man on woman. I have nothing against a serial killer/stalker movie plot, and I even enjoy some minor pictures that fans of ""Halloween"" might consider to be retread in themselves (I still enjoy ""When a Stranger Calls""), but if you want to talk serious film criticism then give ""Halloween 3"" it's due. I can't understand the amount of bad vibes and deconstructive criticism that is proffered on these fabulous extras (which make the purchase of this new DVD edition worth the price alone). What are you apologizing for guys?!
As for the presentation, the picture is good (at least to me), and the bonus features really make up for anything lacking in the specialties of the transfer. If you are a fan of this genre, you deserve to treat yourself to this movie. If you think ""Halloween"" is synonymous with that stalker in the Kirk mask, then avoid giving your brain a new charge of intelligent fun. You may not be able to handle it after all. ""Halloween 3"" doesn't set out to disgust us in the same way, and it was way ahead of its time with its dark themes of cruelty towards children and the uprising of superstitions in modern times. Tom Atkins is a fine, underrated genre movie actor, and this is one of his best roles I think. And we've got that catchy, weird jingle (""Silver Shamrock""!) that will be stuck in your head for ages. And how about that villain! Dan O'Herlihy is the prime example of how to play a creepy movie villain, absolutely pristine. Plus, Stacey Nelkin is gorgeous. And, I cannot neglect to mention the architecture of Nigel Kneale's brilliant source story (although he nearly rejected the project for, being an intelligent man, he did not appreciate the simple-minded and misogynistic ideas of the first two movies, but Carpenter allowed him to start with his own--rather brilliant--ideas that were, apparently, laid down originally by Debra Hill, who also was a competent idea person and a fine lady).
Overall, a great paranoia-themed thriller was sadly misunderstood. Now, however, it's time to get over it, and acknowledge this classic for what it is. Oh...and you don't have to wait until Halloween to watch it yet again!",1388448000,2,3299,4.913978494623656

836648,4,630428845X,"Basically having concluded or so he thought Michael Myers story in Halloween II, producer John Carpenter intended to turn the Halloween series into an anthology, with each year a new Halloween themed film being released under the Halloween banner but, each one a separate and unrelated story. The first of this proposed series is a bizarre, twisted and in my opinion, very underrated little horror thriller that mixes the supernatural with a bit of hi-tech (for the time). The film opens with an atmospheric and spooky sequence of a lone frantic man (Al Berry) clutching a Halloween mask while being pursued by ominous suited figures and finding his way to a gas station where he proclaims that someone is going to kill us before collapsing. Hes brought to a hospital and put under the care of alcoholic Dr. Dan Challis (Tom Atkins) but, later that night one of the suited figures arrives and gruesomely murders the man and then sets fire to himself. Challis soon learns the man was Harry Grimbridge, a local shop owner who was recently reported missing by his daughter Ellie (a smoking hot Stacy Nelkin). Now Ellie and Dan team up to find out what happened to Harry and why someone would want him dead. The only clues being the Silver Shamrock mask he was holding and that picking up a shipment of those masks from the factory in the remote little town of Santa Mira, was the last thing he was known to have been doing. But, when the two get to Santa Mira they find something very sinister is afoot and that factory owner Conal Cochran (Dan OHerlihy) may have a horrible plan in store for the innocents wearing his masks on Halloween using modern technology to resurrect an ancient evil. A lot of fans of the Halloween series were very disappointed with this entry for abandoning Michael Myers and his storyline but, I really liked the idea of an anthology series and I have a lot of fun with this gruesome little horror thriller with a twisted sense of humor. Carpenter pal Tommy Lee Wallace directs and wrote the script from a story by Nigel Kneale and he does a good job of replicating the masters style and having Dean Cundey doing the cinematography and Carpenter and Alan Howarth on musical chores, the film fits right in with the Halloween series despite sharing none of the story elements. There are also some nice gore effects and other make-up to portray the various effects of Cochrans Druid black magic and the aftereffects of his suited thugs handiwork. The film has some nice atmosphere from the score one of Carpenters best, actually and the fact that Wallace has learned a lot about setting up shots from his director friend. We get a flawed hero in the alcoholic divorcee Challis, who is brought to life with a really good performance by Tom Atkins. Dan is a very down to earth and real guy who comes up against a horrifying plan to murder thousands of children and faces the challenge with nobility and guts. Nelkin is a pretty and spunky heroine as Ellie and while it may be a stretch that she would fall so quickly for a borderline wreck like Challis, they do work well together as both characters and actors. And it would be remiss to not give Dan OHerlihy a nod for a strong and creepy villain who has the charm of an angel but, the soul of a devil. The movie has its share of flaws. It can be silly at times, though sometimes it works in its favor, such as a last act that turns into a sort of supernaturally themed James Bond movie complete with a hidden lair, evil world effecting plot and arrogant boastful villain. And some characters are obviously just there for exposition and to be victims. But, I think overall you can forgive some of its flaws because it is such a well intentioned and fun horror thriller that has its heart in the right place and, in retrospect, is actually one of the more original horrors to come out of the franchise heavy 80s despite its farfetched story. A very underrated horror thriller and a spooky, fun and twisted Halloween flick that gets watched every year during the spooky season at MonsterZero NJs lair. A favorite that I find is finally getting the respect it deserves. Listen for vocal cameos by none other then Jaime Lee Curtis during the scenes in Santa Mira. Michael Myers returned to the series in Halloween 4 a few years later and the anthology series idea faded with Halloween IIIs weak box office returns. Too bad, I would have liked to have seen what Carpenter and co. would have come up with for future installments.

836650,5,630428845X,"I will admit, it has been a couple years since I last watched this film, and I have not seen what additions (if any) are in the Blue-Ray edition of the film, but I can say that I have probably watched this Halloween film more times than part 1 and 2 combined, and I love part 1 and 2!
 Unlike most fans of the Halloween series, I really loved this edition to the story, and the Thorn subplot that continued on from here on to part 6 (producer's cut), it really helps to help define the whole fact that Michael Myers is not a mere mortal serial killer. This is not a film about Ted Bundy, these are not Rob Zombie's typical incarnations, there is no warped childhood, there is no violence and rape, it's about occultism, dark magic, and things beyond the realm of reason. Hence the reason Michael Myers doesn't ever seem to die in the previous films even after being shot in not one but two eye sockets! He's powered and controlled by the black magic that Thorn possesses. They are sort of like the Illuminati if you will and this film is part of their back story.
 The only reason I can see to not enjoy this film would be simply because you are expecting Michael Myers. The story is competent, the acting was well executed, and I don't remember being bored for a moment. The only thing I would have added was a small story element detailing the absence of Michael, but they waited to sort of do that until 4 and of course the Producer's cut of 6.
 So again, I emphasis watching this puppy, just remember that there is plenty of Michael action in 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, and that this is just filling in some of the back story for Thorn... oh and that H20 and the one after that do not exist! ;)",1384560000,,1690,4.209876543209877

Factory and i think they did a marvelous job with the HD transfer of the film. i really love the scene where their touring Silver Shamrock. the masks look absolutely vivid and colorful. i couldn't believe how well they stand out. as far as the audio goes you only get an English Mono channel, but because i'm guessing this movie wasn't successful enough to receive a newly mastered 5.1 audio track, Mono is as good as you're going to get. the disc also comes loaded with newly exclusive behind the scenes interviews with cast and crew of the film as well as a revisiting on-scene locations documentary. if you're a fan of this film or a completest looking to purchase this version of the film i highly recommend it.",1382918400,5,1355,4.603305785123967

It would take me quite a few years before I would re-visit ""Halloween III"", but when I did I was pleasantly surprised.

No Michael Myers is nowhere to be seen, and this isn't even like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-Part-V-A-New-Beginning/dp/B0035N8W86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning</a>, where they try to sneak one over on you by having a fake Michael. By now almost everyone knows that they were hoping to turn the Halloween series into an ongoing film series where each film would tackle a different aspect or story surrounding the holiday, and ""Season of the Witch"" was going to be the kickstart of this series now that the Myers saga had wrapped.

As ""Halloween III"" opens we meet a man on the run clutching a child's Halloween mask. He seems to be babbling about someone trying to kill him and issuing vague warnings. He's taken to the hospital where he's sedated and put to bed, only to have someone break into his room and kill him, then strolls out to the parking lot and lights himself on fire? Dr. Challis meets with the babbling man's daughter, Ellie, and they decide to look into who killed her father. The only clue they have is the mask the man was clutching, a Silver Shamrock brand mask. They head off to the Silver Shamrock factory, there they meet the genial owner of Silver Shamrock and the family of the winning salesperson who all get personal tours of the facility. They also find the car that belongs to Ellie's father. It's not long before Challis and Ellie realize something is very wrong with Silver Shamrock, it's employees and owner.

No, ""Halloween III"" isn't a particularly good film, but there are a lot of things to like about it. From the new John Carpenter theme, to the creepy masks, to the nifty Silver Shamrock jingle, to the awesome montage in the middle of the film with the trick or treaters rushing home to watch the ""big giveaway"". Yes, you have to turn off your brain for this movie, as it really doesn't make much sense. But if you roll with it, and pop it in to watch a goofy 80's horror flick, it can be a fun evening.",1382659200,2,2400,4.748201438848921
836718,5,630428845X,"I watched this a lot as a kid and even more as an adult, and it was one of the best horror films ever made in my opinion, anyone saying that it ""sucked"" just because Myers was not walking around slashing people, are idiots. It should have been a stand alone film in itself. This movie is a work of art and has a great, creepy music score. Nothing more creepy than some old madman wanting to kill millions of kids on Halloween night via Television. Way better than your typical slasher movie, and will always be a classic in my book. Also seeing the spooky looking factory outside at night and knowing all the evil that lurks inside really gives you that Halloween vibe.",1382572800,9,669,4.36
836719,2,630428845X,"Have watched this movie twice with last night being the second time and LAST time I'll ever watch it again. I gave it a second try only because I thought maybe I just didn't understand it completely the first time around. Some movies need a second viewing to totally understand it. PLEASE don't waste your time on this movie because it has nothing to do with Michael Myers or really Halloween for that matter, although they've tucked the theme of Halloween bit by bit into this movie with the history of Halloween as well as the masks. Give me a break!! What happened Moustapha Akkad? Maybe Akkad was burnt out from M.M. and wanted to switch things up for a change but why in the MIDDLE of the series? That's what I don't get!! If he was going to do this one why not at the end when ALL of the M.M. series were over and done with and before Zombie picked up where Akkad left off?
The only thing great about this movie was the DVD cover! I really like the cover because it LOOKS like what the movie should be about - Witches some how in some way and with M.M. incorporated into it. They could've easily master minded a story line that had to do with the history of Halloween dating back to the original Celtic Samhain  which would've been awesome with background music by Loreena McKennitt like the Mummer's Dance and later lead it up to the M.M. and his murderous trail as a boy because of the Halloween holiday etc... Then the cover of the DVD would've fit perfect with the actual story of the movie. But why to use such a neat picture of Trick or Treaters on the cover of such a BAD movie as this I'll never understand. Of course I know where the got the picture because it's in the movie where they show the children going out trick or treating but is so deceiving to the public because it really has nothing to do with Witches or for that matter the true history of trick or treating and Halloween. Just a stupid movie if you ask me. However, Akkad had a smart mind in making this movie with such a story but I would've never thought in a million years or will never understand why he had to incorporate it into the middle of his M.M. Halloween series. Just really doesn't make any sense at all.
Giving this picture 2 stars: 1, for effort and 2, for the awesome picture of the Trick or Treaters and colors on the front of the DVD cover!
Hope my review will help someone in their decision in seeing the movie or not and if they should purchase this DVD or not. Trust me, DON'T waste your time UNLESS you're into SY-FI and anything alien then this is the movie for you. But if you're into REAL spooky good Halloween movies with a good story AND thinking this is another M.M. story to add to the others - WRONG! Think again.

836721,5,630428845X,"I find Michael Meyers boring. Maybe that's part of the reason I came at Halloween 3: Season Of The Witch from a totally unbiased place. It's my favorite of the franchise. Like others have said, I too think its inclusion in the Halloween series hampers its appreciation, and if it was just called Season Of The Witch, it would be accepted as the beloved seasonal classic it deserves to be. Season Of The Witch is the It's A Wonderful Life of October 31st. It has everything a Halloween movie should have. It builds anticipation towards and revolves around the holiday, the incessant Silver Shamrock jingle recalling those awesome Halloween holiday promotions that used to happen when I was a kid in the Chicagoland area. I remember bugging the heck out of my parents for a pair of 3D glasses from 7-11 so I could get home after trick or treating to watch channel 32's Son of Svengoolie present The Creature From The Black Lagoon in 3D ( I missed it ). Like the holiday, it has a seedy, unseemly undercurrent, particularly with its mostly unlikable 'hero,' a divorced surgeon who boozes and smokes too much, is apparently disliked by his kids, and ducks out of town to spend the weekend with a younger woman ostensibly to help her. It recalls the ancient meaning of Samhain, and best of all, it has Dan O'Herlihey as a smiling Irish gag and toymaker who owes his allegiance to an ancient, sinister, nationwide witch cult, and seeks to sacrifice the trick or treaters of America in the ultimate Halloween 'prank.' It's no seminal masterpiece, but it really is a fantastically enjoyable, pulpy movie, terribly underrated by legions of Michael Meyers fans. Don't listen to the hate. It's as much a Halloween tradition to me as Great Pumpkin and The Halloween Tree.",1382400000,9,1759,4.732899022801303

836766,5,630428845X,"About a month ago when I was scanning the internet for some Halloween themed films to enjoy this month, I came across Halloween III: Season of the Witch. Now prior to me searching and finding this movie I had no idea it ever even existed, simply because when it comes to the Halloween series all you're ever used to hearing about is Michael Myers Michael Myers Michael Myers and also because this movie is generally hated by 98% of Halloween fans. I read the synopsis of the film, fled to YouTube to watch the trailer and I knew I immediately HAD to have this movie on DVD and it's a decision I don't regret at all

The plot of the film revolves around an evil man named Conal Cochran, an Irish warlock who's the overlord of Northern California town Santa Mira and owner of Silver Shamrock Novelties with a deadly master plan for Halloween

A Silver Shamrock Novelties worker, Mr. Gambridge ends up in the hospital, clutching one of the masks after being chased by an assailant who seems to have no feelings at all. Mr. Gambridge is put under the care of Dr. Challis, who warns Challis saying ""they're going to kill us all"". Later that night, the emotionless assailant sneaks in the hospital and kills Mr. Gambridge before killing himself.

Dr. Challis and the daughter of Mr. Cambridge, Ellie, want answers to why her father was murdered so they team together and travel to Santa Mira for clues, where they discover that Conal Cochran is selling his signature Silver Shamrock Halloween masks to children all across America. They soon discover that inside the back of each mask, behind the logo, lies a small ancient piece of Stonehenge. When the Silver Shamrock Novelties commercial airs on Halloween night, the Stonehenge will be triggered and melt every kid's head that is wearing a mask. Cochran stresses that everyone celebrates Halloween without truly knowing the meaning of it and longs for the day where society returns to times where human sacrifices were an ordinary part of life. Thus he devises his mastery plan, using witchcraft to achieve it. It's up to Dr. Challis and Ellie Cambridge to stop the evil Conal Cochran from going through with his plan that will kill thousands of kids on Halloween night. The question is, can they stop him in time or will they be stopped ""dead"" in their tracks?

Conclusion: I took the time to do all the research I could about this movie and I discovered that after Michael Myers had been killed off in Halloween 2, John Carpenter originally planned to take the Halloween series in a whole new direction with a new movie with a different plot being released every year around Halloween time. Halloween III: Season of the Witch was the kick start for this new project but that was as far as it got. After the movie received poor reception and was the worst performing Halloween movie of all and got endless complaints from fans about Halloween III not featuring Michael Myers, Carpenter's plans for the Halloween series came to an abrupt end and Michael Myers returned in 1988's Halloween 4: Return of Michael Myers. The fact remains that Halloween III is a very underrated movie that doesn't get the respect or recognition it deserves from fans. Michael Myers should have remained dead after Halloween II, and Halloween III should've been the start of something new but that unfortunately was not the case. I promise you that if you can watch this movie with an open mind and NOT think about Michael Myers, you will enjoy this film a whole lot! I know I did!",1380758400,4,3505,4.694308943089431

We all know it was a huge mistake calling it ""Halloween III"" because if its a ""Halloween"" movie we want Michael Myers and a bug butcher knife.  I know I wasn't alone with this however this film killed ""Halloween"" films for years. We did not get another ""Halloween"" film until 1988 and of course they brought back Michael Myers. However everyone needs to Judge this film as a film not related to the other ""Halloween"" movies.  When you do you will see the film works and its a fun time.  See the film.  If you like it then buyt the SHOUT FACTORY RELEASE,  It treats this film with respect it deserves and its always fun seeing Sean CLark doing his location stuff.

836768,2,630428845X,I only baught this to complete my collection it's a pretty bad movie has nothin to do with Michael Myers an shouldn't even be considered a Halloween movie,1379721600,2,154,4.535714285714286
836769,3,630428845X,"The beginning shows us what sort of morbid shit we're in for. A frantic man who would have probably died from fright if he wasn't murdered enters a hospital after killing a suited man. The mysterious guys partner comes in and finishes the witness off in a painful and somewhat gruesome manner. After that he takes the mask the freaked man was holding, gets into his car, and lights himself on fire.

 A doctor who witnessed this, Daniel, goes to the bar to chill out and is confronted by the dead man's daughter. Together they agree to try and find out the truth; this leads them to the Silver Shamrock Novelties Company (Largest mask makers in the world.) There they discover a diabolical plan and rush to stop the destruction, all the while being chased.

 Tom Atkins plays Dr. Daniel and does an excellent job. (Want to see more of his face? Rent The Fog). I believed him. His female sidekick Ellie (Stacy Nelkin) does her thing and does it well enough -- all cast and characters are decent enough to keep this one rolling. The directing was impressive, especially considering this was Tommy Lee Wallaces' debut. The film has the added luxury of being produced by John Carpenter and Debra Hill.

The plan of the villain is easy enough to figure out, but why the hell is he doing any of this? Never explained and for the life of me I cant come up with my own explanation, other than the convenient one that filmmakers like to use when they don't wish to think too much: he's just insane.

 Halloween 3 isn't gory but it does have it's juicy moments. I especially enjoyed the decapitation :)

 Many were turned off by the fact that a certain masked villain was absent from the production; Carpenter has originally planned to have Halloween themed films, all different horror stories, centering on this mysterious holiday. The original plan fell through, however, when the fans screamed from blood -- the blood that only the knife of Michael Myers could wield.

 Not a feel-good clich horror flick and for that I applaud. There were some pretty slow moments and a few people may find it more boring than entertaining. But any lapses were made worth it to me with the cool ending and all the tight buildup.

 My advice: Ignore the absence of Myers and focus on the story alone. It's worth it.",1379635200,2,2291,4.58578431372549

Carpenter didn't want anything to with the ""shape"" he created in the first Halloween. And this has nothing to do with a stalker roaming a defenseless little town. Halloween 3 is about the story of ""witchcraft"" and the true meaning of Halloween and playing an EVIL joke on the children. IT's a pretty chilling story when you really indulge yourself into it.  Halloween 3 has great atmosphere, great classic Carpenter music, great acting and best of all, it's just a good movie for any horror buff. I compare the goodness of Halloween 3 to Carpenter's ""The Fog"" in terms of goodness and also being an underrated film. Tom Atkins, who was also the main actor in The Fog,  is one of the best horror movie actors of the 80's as far as I'm concerned and he should have been given more attention than he got. The pacing, the amazing special effects and again, atmosphere, is what John Carpenter does best. When Carpenter and Debra Hill do things together, they work magic. So, that said.  Do yourself a favor, buy this blu ray, turn out the lights, crank up your speakers, and enjoy Halloween III. It's definitely a good horror movie. Don't let the haters tell you otherwise.",1379289600,2,1314,4.6068376068376065
836771,5,630428845X,"What more positive things can I say about this film that hasn't already been said before.  Always considered the black sheep of the Halloween film family, Season of the Witch is an underrated gem of a movie.  In my most humble opinion this film is the second best of the franchise with Carpenter's original being the first (of course).  Many have said that the film would have had greater success if the Halloween title had been dropped and just went under the name Season of the Witch.  While that may or may not be true (we'll never know), this film is more deserving of the Halloween name than many of the films that succeded it (Yes, Mr. Zombie and Mr. Rhymes, I'm talking to you two).  The cinematography is amazing, the score is completely effective, and the unsettling atmosphere of the film rivals the original.

Where is Michael Myers has forever burned an image of sheer terror in the minds of fans, Conal Cochran is in his own right downright creepy and unforgettable.  The scene in the movie where Cochran is explaining the true meaning of Halloween to Dr. Chalis (Tom Atkins) is very chillng thanks in large part to Dean Cundeys' camera work. The way Cundey lights (or lack of light) and frames Daniel O'Herlihy's face evokes memories of another tall and creepy gray haired man, Angus Scrimms' Tall Man from the Phantasm series.  By and large, the cast of Halloween 3 are very good in their roles, but it is (in my opinion) O'Herlihy's  wonderful performance that steals the show. His presence alone commands the viewers attention.  This attribute would serve him well again 5 years down the road in a somewhat similar role in Robocop.

If you haven't seen Halloween 3, then do yourself a favor and watch it.  Like the original, Halloween 3 relies on suspense, cinematograpy, and good acting to get the job done, not gore.",1379203200,3,1835,4.682242990654205

836824,4,630428845X,"Halloween III gets a great release despite it being disliked by many Halloween and non-Halloween fans alike. It has nothing to do with the other films but it is interesting in its own way. The decision to toss all previous ideas except the title was so unexpected that I'm sure many people like me took their VHS out of the machine wondering what this film has to do with Mike Myers. Suddenly ""Halloween"" meant a movie about ""trick or treaters"" every year. Halloween wasn't exactly a slasher anymore. In this version, Mike Myers gets replaced with a mask distributor. Those ideas were quickly scrapped when Part IV brought Mike Myers back into the spotlight. I'm still trying to figure out if the subtitle refers to the holiday, a witch or something else. We have a cult director (Wallace) doing something original. Instant classic. After Halloween III, Wallace directed Fright Night II (1988), Vampires: Los Muertos (2002), and Stephen King's It (1990 TV). I still remember classic moments (people getting zapped) and dialogue (""misfire"").

Halloween III is really about a toy company manufacturing evil masks on Halloween (and it gets weirder). What I love about SotW is the slickness of the '80s mixed with the creative ideas of the '70s. They aren't as willing to risk profits on new ideas now. I enjoyed SotW and feel it works well as a stand-alone horror film. It is *much* better than people give it credit. I would even say it is one of the better Halloween sequels if you want to be objective. This Blu-ray Collector's Edition is worthy of it's name because it's the first release of extras for this film. Halloween III has never looked or sounded better (this is a good job not a rush job). There is roughly an hour of bonus supplements and 2 audio commentaries included.

No other film can quite compare to the gonzo sci-fi/horror insanity that HALLOWEEN III delivers on. You get deadly masks, mesmerizing commercials, catchy jingles, creepy crawlies, warlocks, automatons and so much more. Being able to get my hands on this gem with such a beautiful transfer and so many cool extras really made me a happy horror geek. Shout!

The movie is an enjoyable and creepy little tale about an old goon who makes Silver Shamrock masks that causes mutations for those who wear them. It reminded me of the Creepshow films and personally I found it really inventive. Personally I consider it a plus that it didn't feature the dull Michael Myers again and would probably be much better thought of if it didn't have the Halloween series badge hanging over it.

This amazing new DVD edition contains many new extra features that were not on the previous releases. These include 2 audio commentaries, an extensive 'making of' documentary and a visit to the filming locations (and more!)

I think time has been kind to Halloween 3 and I hope that as it is looking and sounding better than ever, more people will re-evaluate this dark little tale and get as much enjoyment from it as I do.",1366502400,3,921,4.575757575757576

836910,5,630428845X,"The reaction to Halloween III always fascinates me; a film that sometimes seems universally despised, yet I believe has a strong cult following.  This is a film that I didn't even make it through the first time I watched it, yet now is one of my 5 favorite films!  For me, there is little not to praise about the film.  The story, with its Body Snatchers-esque vibe, is very compelling and fun.  Tom Atkins makes a very likeable hero and Dan O'Herlihy  is terrific as the villain.  In addition, the film has another great John Carpenter score.  The complaints that could be made about the film, such as some illogical plot details and one unintentionally (?) humorous seduction scene, actually add to its charm for me.  The Scream Factory Blu-ray release is a total winner.  The HD transfer is terrific and the extras are a real treat.  A documentary on the making of the film provides a fascinating look at the conception of the film that one participant says was flawed from the beginning.  Two wonderful commentaries and the always-fun Horror's Hallowed Grounds round out the package.",1364515200,2,1087,4.759358288770054
836911,5,630428845X,found this movie to be the best sequel in the Halloween series. Although the story doesn't center around Michael Meyers it's still very unique and entertaining. highly recommend!,1364256000,,178,5.392857142857143
836912,3,630428845X,"This movie was an effort by John Carpenter to make a series of movies under the name Halloween without the Michael Myers character (aside from when Halloween was playing on TV in the background). It was a total flop, and hence the series of movies never developed and the studio went on to make multiple movies with Myers that ranged from pretty good, to incredibly stupid without Carpenter's involvement.

I think this movie was doomed as soon as they tried to put the Halloween label on it. By then the Michael Myers character was synonymous with Halloween and anything that did not have him in it was never going to be given a shot. Personally I think Carpenter should have just promoted it under his name and not given it the Halloween title (something even the people involved admit). It probably would have done better and the series would have probably produced more than one film.

As a movie I thought it was good, but not great. Given when it was made the writing and special effects were kind of cheesy, but it definitely has that creepy factor that any good horror movie has. The storyline was definitely weird and will not appeal to everyone. It was basically a company making haunted Halloween masks that when worn when a particular commercial came on would kill the person wearing it. It also had killer androids that would do the bad guy's dirty work. While there are certainly better horror movies out there, if you are a fan of the genre, and are ok with an offbeat out there kind of story line and the lack of Michael Myers you may want to check this out.",1362355200,,1574,4.538732394366197
836913,5,630428845X,"I've been a fan of this film since I first seen it in the early 80's.  I was born in 1979, so I was probably around 5 or 6 when I first seen it.

Over the years I've come to love this film more than ever.  The filming locations are beautiful, the music is some of the best recorded for a horror film, the acting is pretty good, the masks are indeed creepy, and the GORE is amazing!  Are there a few plot holes? Yes.  But this type of film is supposed to be taken seriously.  This type of film shouldn't be viewed the way that a film like ""Citizen Kane"" should be viewed.  This is a film for fun, some jumps, scares, & GORE!!

""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" is a very dark, complex horror film, & one of the best the 1980's has to offer.  This movie would not have this bad reputation if it wasn't associated with the Halloween/Michael Myers predecessors.  Decades later, here in 2013, the film finally seems to be getting some new found respect as a cult horror film....respect that is long overdue.

836914,2,630428845X,Let me preface what I'm about to say that taste is subjective and this is only one persons point of view. With that said when this movie first came out I remember not liking it very much. I liked the idea of trying to create a different story with this movie. I'm not sure if the execution of this plot  really  clicked for me. I saw myself trying to re-work the movie which isn't really the point. I would rate this movie 2 stars which is a half star better than I would have gave it when I saw it in the theater 30+ years ago. The video collectors edition has some nice bonus stuff and behind the scenes footage making it more worthwhile than just the plain movie. Again I actually like this movie better now than I did back then and it's probably due to this well put together bonus edition.,1359763200,,794,4.183006535947713
836965,4,630428845X,"Yes, this is a sequel in name only, and it is a shame that it briefly takes Michael Myers out of the Halloween franchise, but this is still a very fun watch and cult classic in it's own right. If you like bad b-horror like The Stuff and Troll 2, you are going to love this, which is a step above those, but still manages the ""so bad it's good"" vibe. On the high end, this film is somewhat comparable to They Live. Plus, it starts the great Tom Atkins, and you can't go wrong there.",1359417600,,481,4.020833333333333
836966,5,630428845X,"Halloween 3: Season of the Witch is very underrated by many so-called horror fans because it does not feature Michael Myers, the psycho-killer in the rest of the Halloween franchise. It is still a wonderful little horror movie, mostly due to the masterful performance of Tom Atkins. Should it have been called Halloween 3? No. It should instead have just been titled Season of the Witch and just thought of as a separate horror-thriller. Now, with that being said, it was produced by John Carpenter and Debra Hill and co-written by an uncredited John Carpenter. The majority of the writing duties however were handled by the film's director, Tommy Lee Wallace, who was also the costume creator of Michael Myers in Halloween 1.

The movie is most famous for the ""Silver Shamrock jingle."" The plot is not as good as most of the Michael Myers films, but it is still great. Dr. Dan Challis (Tom Atkins) is a divorced alcoholic doctor who comes across a delirious man clutching a Halloween mask while working the night shift at the local hospital. After the man warns them that ""they're going to kill us all"", Dr. Challis finds the man dead and finds that his killer committed suicide by blowing himself up in the parking lot. With far more questions than answers, the man's daughter Ellie Grimbridge (Stacey Nelkin) asks Challis for his assistance as they travel up to Santa Mira, California to visit her father's last known whereabouts before the hospital - the Silver Shamrock Novelties factory (who manufactured the mask her dad was holding.) In Santa Mira, they notice the odd behavior of the locals, the overreaching surveillance placed on the towns' citizens, and the shrouded secrecy behind the factory's operator, Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy). As the events in Santa Mira become more and more disconcerting, Dr. Challis and Ellie decided to do some snooping around the factory. They eventually find that Cochran is manufacturing the masks in an effort to kill everyone on Halloween. Will they succeed in stopping Cochran's nefarious plans? Will they leave unscathed?

Now, I understand how a lot of the people who were expecting another Michael Myers film would be disappointed that he wasn't included in the film at all.  However, the film (though obviously low in budget) made up for his absence through provided a horror film in a different vein.  While the usual Halloween movies are slasher films, this one offers up a hybrid of sci-fi/horror that focuses less on gore and more on intensity.  The production crew went into a different direction on this one and made a movie that was less of a mindless thriller and more of a horror-oriented satire on the effects of commercialism and consumerism.  Though it shares little with the other Halloween movies, it could be viewed as a quasi-predecessor for John Carpenter's future work,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/They-Live/dp/B000ID379U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">They Live</a>.

The story is out there and interesting.  It has just the right amount of dread, cheesiness, gore, and social critique.  It actually has some really great cinematography and a great score as well.  I enjoy this movie more every time I see it and it is probably the best at getting me into the Halloween spirit as this movie actually has to do with the holiday itself.

As for the Blu-ray : wow.  If you were a fan of the movie before then you have to have this.  It looks fantastic.  I was really surprised when I first watched it.  For a low budget, early 80's ""horror"" picture the film stock must be in pretty decent shape.  It really shows off Dean Cundey's beatiful cinematography.

Tom Atkins is flawless as the boozy, randy doctor who, on the offbeat chance of getting laid, uncovers a dark, horrifying secret to kill children.

I waited for YEARS for a good release of this film. Something it deserved. And now here it is.

I expected another Michael Myer's film, and was extremely disappointed at what I was watching, so I completely understand all the hate that comes with this film.  It is not a slasher, so if that is what you are expecting, this might not be the film for you.  I purchased the Halloween II/Halloween III combo set a few years ago because it was the same price at the store as the single film Halloween II and thought why not, and never took the time to watch Halloween III.  I had my gf purchase this with Halloween II in the new Collector's set, so I decided to give the film a second thought, and I'm really glad that I did.  I first want to point out the the cinematography is amazing.  I had to go back to see the other disc, and though it isn't advertised on the box, this definitely looks remastered, even more so than Halloween II did in this edition.  The story itself is a little weird, but what really makes this film work is Tom Atkins' role as the cheating husband who seems to fall into this adventure just as much for a piece of tale as for wanting to stop the corporation.  This is pure B movie brilliance made by Tommy Lee Wallace, director of Stephen King's IT.  I find his films so watchable for inexplicable reasons.  I am not sure if this is a true Halloween film, though part of me wishes they let Michael Myers die in the previous film and that the franchise was more of an anthology than a direct franchise.

837066,5,630428845X,"This little gem is my favorite Halloween movie (I even told John Carpenter this when I met him in 2011). The spirit of Halloween, the reality of evil and the fear of new technology are merged into a moody, atmospheric thriller. In my humble opinion, Tom Atkins' best role as Dr. Challis (I used the name for a character in my second novel as tribute) and he pulls off one of the best disillusioned doctors in celluloid history (makes Dr. McCoy from Star Trek look like the Easter Bunny); Dan O' Herlihy (The Old Man from Robocop and the eerie prophet from Insavion USA-1952) is incredibly sinister as Conal Cochran, the mad, Celtic witch/toy maker planning to kill off our population with Halloween masks that shoot a magickal laser beam into your head and produces a hodge-podge of critters in your skull; not even Vincent Price could have done better; Stacy Nelligan is one of those sweet/sexy actresses that appeared in a few movies back in the 1980's and then vaporized.

The synthesizer Carpenter score is some of the best he ever created and is iconic; the annoying little ""Silver Shamrock"" tune is easily recongized and either makes you sing along or cringe, depending on your feelings for the whole matter.

Stuntman Dick Warlock (Michael Myers from Halloween II-1981) plays one of the cyborgs; he's the one that pulls the old man's face apart and then sets himself on fire at the end of the first act; we see him several more times throughout the movie and he even gets his wirey guts pulled out in one scene, courtesy of Dr. Challis.

Scenes from the original Halloween (1978) can be seen on a televison screen late in the movie when Conal Cochran places a skull mask on Dr. Challis' head in hopes that the laser beam in the back of the mask will put paid to our poor hero.

The scenes of snakes and bugs coming out of the head of the dead boy in the test room sequence harken back to the nursery ryme, What Are Little Boys Made Of? and a subtle, grotesque reminder of a witch's brew. Nasty to behold? Yeah, but very cool.

The Blue Stones stolen from Stonehenge get very little play in the movie, but receive lots of detail in the novelization.

Now about the girl (Stacy Nelligan) whom Dr. Challis rescues only to discover that she's a cyborg, too. Was she always a cyborg or did we leave the real girl back at the Silver Shamrock factory? We will never know for sure.

Nandy Loomis (Annie from the original Halloween) plays Dr. Challis' harpy of an ex-wife.

Nightfall seems to cover every city in North America at the same time, regardless of time zones, during the montage sequence where we hear the entire track of the Silver Shamrock tune; a span of a minute and a half.

In the novelization the ntire manuscript was written in first person from Dr. Challis' perspective, and entire gross-out scenes are missing.

John Carpenter did not want to turn Halloween into a continuous franchise vehicle for Michael Myers the way Hammer did for Frankenstein and Dracula, and originally planned to do different Halloween terror tales in each consecutive movie, but the public didn't agree so Halloween died for six years until Trancas International resurrected the franchise with Michael Myers' return in 1988.

Fans were extremely disappointed as the studio and its producers deceived the audience into thinking this film was a slasher film with Michael Myers as the word Halloween was used in the title. Michael Myers does not appear in the finished movie and the plot deals with a ""mad scientist"" story.

 What the movie does have going for it are the extremely gory death scenes, some of the best I have ever seen in a horror movie, but the plot is lackluster, child-like and boring in my opinion. Still, it's nice to have the film with all the other ""Halloween"" movies in your library to complete your collection.

Clearly, it was a bad idea to name the film ""Halloween"" and I'm sure that in hindsight it would have been just named ""Season of the Witch"". That being said, the venom that most people spew at this film is based totally n the fact that it is a Halloween film that does not include Michael Myers (although this is kind of a lie since he does appear briefly in an advertisment for Halloween playing during the film). The film itself stands up quite well, and is as creepy and terrifying a film as you will ever see. The acting is expertly done and the story is effective. It was meant to be an ongoing series (according to director Tommy Lee Wallace) whereas a new Halloween film (holiday based, not Michael Myers based) would be released each year with the holiday being the common theme. I dearly wish they would have been able to keep it going.

The DVD package is awesome and includes many extras that I never imagined would be available for this film. The picture doesn't look any better, but the DVD is worth its weight in gold thanks to the extras. Top notch job by Shout! Factory!!!",1351555200,,1184,4.381818181818182

837073,4,630428845X,"Nothing will beat the original Halloween.  But for something completely different, give Halloween III: Season of the Witch a try, you will not be disappointed.  It has nothing to do with the other Halloween films or Michael Myers, and, when viewed on its own, it is a good horror movie that has a cult following of its own, a great score (thanks to throwbacks to John Carpenter's Halloween and The Thing), a brilliantly catchy and scary song to the tune of ""London Bridge is Falling Down"", and a creepy story that make it a very worthy watch.

The original idea behind Halloween was to do a new movie every year, based around Halloween, with no other connections.  From there, the movies could go off on their own and spawn their own franchises accordingly.  This started with John Carpenter's Halloween and Michael Myers introduction, but the mistake was made to do a direct sequel first, before going with something completely different, like Halloween III.  So history remembers this as the red-headed stepchild, a movie with nothing to do with Michael Myers, so it was panned and booed around the country upon its 1982 release, destined to be a gas station barrel bin movie.

But hidden behind the title is actually a good movie, written and directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, the same guy behind the movie adaptation of Stephen King's It.  The other sequels (and Rob Zombie's 2 lackluster remakes) are just more of the same: Michael Myers mindlessly killing people, missing the beauty, tension, and originality of the original movie.  This movie's only similarity is that the story happens on Halloween too, that's it.  No Shape, no Jamie Lee Curtis screaming, no giant butcher knives, just a story about a mad scientist who wants to bring back the real reason why people started Halloween in the first place, with a great ending.  There are pieces of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Stepford Wives, and even some of the tension from Carpenter's Halloween present.

It is shocking that a movie like this is getting a Collector's Edition release, but the latest Blu-Ray/DVD release gives a great transfer, and has some great special features, so for fans of the movie, or for people who want to check it out for the first time, you will have plenty to keep busy with.  The cast and crew are present for a Making Of Halloween III feature, and they really gave everything they had for what they felt was a good movie, and I cannot disagree.

If only this was made before Halloween II, then both Michael Myers and the different Halloween movie each year idea could both have survived and worked.  If you are curious why people think of this so badly, watch and judge for yourself, you won't be mad that you did if you are a horror fan who wants something fun and different.",1350518400,2,2774,4.714285714285714
837074,5,630428845X,"I'm one of the few people that actually really like this movie. Trust me I get it, there's no Michael Myers, no Dr. Loomis and it has nothing to do with the original Halloween or Halloween 2. All that aside you should really watch this movie for what it is. When it comes down to it this movie is really just another Halloween story and completely on its own. Sure its possible it wouldn't have created the controversy with the fans if it was simply named ""Season Of The Witch"" but it is what it is, so if your looking for Michael Myers and for it to pick up where Halloween 2 left off then you won't be happy with this one. If your looking for an original and atmospheric Halloween/Horror movie..then this is it. It still has the John Carpenter feel and atmosphere, even his music is there. Ever since I saw this as a kid, I felt torn because it wasn't truly a Michael Myers movie, but on the other hand I really dug the atmosphere and the plot. It not being related to the other Halloween movies and Michael Myers is just something that can cloud your judgement of the movie. Look at it like this, Friday The 13th Pt. 5 didn't technically have Jason in it either and that movie is actually so bad its good, but this movie probably gets a worse rep. As far as it being called Halloween 3, well thats the movies biggest flaw..the title. I like it for the movie it is and to be honest with you I like it more then some of the later Halloween sequels. So give it a try, forget the name or the association with Michael Myers or lack of it. It might just surprise you. Enjoy the horrorthon.",1350518400,,1586,4.220394736842105

And i feel the same way about it now as i did then. This is a very good,if not great horror film!
OK.so Michael Myers isn't in it,but so what?Judge this film on its own merits. A very clever story (i believe the original screenplay was written by no less a personage than Nigel Kneale) and wonderful direction and cinematography by John Carpenter stalwarts Tommy Lee Wallace and Dean Cundey. Add to that some great performances by the very underrated Tom Atkins,Stacey Nelkin and Dan o'Herlihy and you have a very watchable experience.
The picture quality is very good,certainly better than my old DVD copy,and a fairly decent sound(2.1 DTS i believe).Some informative extras-a documentary about the making of the film,and a revisit to the original localities. The outtakes at the end of this made me titter!
In my personal opinion this is the second best film in the 'Halloween' franchise,obviously next to JC's 1978 classic. Oh,and Stacey Nelkin is a fox!",1350345600,2,1205,4.770334928229665

837118,4,630428845X,"Halloween 3 is, for some, an unwelcome disruption to the Halloween movie series that was supposedly one that would feature Micheal Myers as a villain who can't seem to die. However, some people embraced a completely different kind of movie that was supposed to set a new pattern of a different type of Halloween film with each release. Well, the public fascination with Myers reduced this underrated film into just a cult classic. I say this film is underrated because it has a very unique storyline, and there's something mysterious about the Silver Shamrock factory and the impact it has over a small town in the middle of nowhere. Of course, my analysis cannot ignore the main villain in the movie, the icy and even more mysterious Conal Cochran, the CEO of the Silver Shamrock company who plots to kill millions of innocent people on Halloween night with masks that have a built-in chip that will detonate when people view the TV commercial. This movie is more of a mystery than horror, as a doctor is investigating a death linked to the Shamrock company. Yes, this movie is quirky, but in a good way. Men in suits (robots) who mindlessly kill for Cochran? This movie isn't that scary, so if you're looking for edge-of-your-seat horror, then look elsewhere. If you're looking for a unique storyline coupled with some humor and a little thrill and Halloween for good measure, then check out this one.",1349740800,,1403,4.777777777777778
837119,3,630428845X,"Halloween 3 Season of the witch is one of those sequels that have been argued about countless times by horror fans as to whether is is an underrated classic, or a piece of crap. I happen to be in that majority that feels the latter, that it is a much underappreciated horror film that, while not up to snuff with the previous Halloween movies, is still a frightening and provocative little picture in and of itself. The story, to avoid giving any spoilers, involves killer halloween masks. This premise angered and repelled fans of the first 2 during its initial release.  But the thing is, the writers of Halloween originally wanted to adapt an anthology format to this series. They wanted Michael Myers to die in part 2, and for each subsequent Halloween picture to be revolving around some different type of Halloween-related indica: masks, etc. Imagine the possibilities! But no, the fans only wanted Michael Myers back, so the film bombed at the box office as well as with fans and critics.  It's only recently started to get a bit of a cult fan base. So here is your warning: this movie has NOTHING to do with Michael Myers.  If you are expecting that, you'll hate this movie. However, if you go into it with an open mind like I did, you might enjoy it. All I can say is, see for yourself.",1349740800,,1295,4.5256410256410255
837120,5,630428845X,"This movie really has gotten the shaft for 20 years, mostly due to the fact that there is no Michael Myers in it. Ok..sure, everyone was looking for, and expecting some more of Mikey tearing it up. They didn't do a very good job of promoting this movie to let the moviegoers know what to expect. This is well before the days, where you get hd full length trailers on your laptop at home, 6 months before the movie comes out.
But, I love this movie. Saw it when I was 12, and it scared the crap ot of me. Of course, I was 12..so take that for what it's worth. But, years later, it still gives me a creepy vibe. It is definitely more ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" than any of the other ""Halloween"" movies.
It has some serious logic problems (how exactly can you move a big chunk from Stonhenge across an ocean, without anyone noticing?), and some gaping plotholes (the big giveaway is at 9. Wouldn't the people on the east coast already encountered the evil plan 3 hours before?)..but I don't care. It has an awesome non-Hollywood ending, and some eerie music throughout, to keep the mood steady. And that is not counting the Silver Shamrock jingle. No matter how much people hate the movie, everyone seems to know what ""8 more days till Halloween, Halloween.."" means!
Now, the Blu-Ray.  Very well done. Fantastic! Especially when you consider the only previous release, was a bare bones dvd. The movie looks superb! The bonus material is top notch too. I could have never imagined a documentary on this movie. Really gives you some great insight. And pretty much everyone you would hope to hear talk about the movie, does. There is also a piece, that takes you back to the spots where they filmed the movie. Nothing great, but still interesting.
I have yet to listen to the audio commentaries, but if they are anything close to what I have already seen..I am sure it's excellent.

the first release was from Universal back in 2003, terrible release it's barebones, just a trailer and productions notes for the extras

I Don't mind the film, cause it doesn't have Michael myers in it it's still a good thriller/Horror to watch

for any Halloween fan buy the Halloween III collectors edition DVD or blu-ray from shout factory, definitely worth the money
the picture and audio are excellent 10/10 much better than the 2003 universal release
has making of Documentary with cast and crew and 2 audio commentaries and more this shout factory release is the best version you'll ever get

837123,5,630428845X,"As with my review for Shout! Factory's Halloween II release, this is not a review of the actual movie. Most who see it, hate Halloween III. However it is beloved by many hardcore fans of the franchise.

Halloween III is the b**tard child of the Halloween series. Most hate it because it has nothing to do with our favorite serial killer in the white mask. But for those of us fans who adore it just as much as the rest of the series, we've been longing for something more than just the movie itself on a disc. Shout! Factory, once again, delivers with their very special release of Halloween III. Just the same as Halloween II, the transfer quality is perfect. The special features, given that we've never had any with any HIII release, are phenomenal with a ""making of"" featurette, trailers, TV spots, and a still gallery. Not to mention the cool reversible covers that come with both HII and HIII (new original art on one side and the original poster art on the other).",1349395200,,971,4.517045454545454
837124,4,630428845X,"Let's get right to it: You and I already know that, some 30 years ago, the producers of the ""Halloween"" franchise took a gamble that didn't pay off.  Not only did it not pay off, but few horror films--sequels or not--have been as reviled as this one.  So let me tell you upfront that I always kinda liked it.

Now, to the Blu-ray.  Given the film's reputation, it's pretty amazing that we even HAVE a Blu-ray of it, let alone a bonus-packed 30th anniversary deluxe treatment.  So if you're only of the few fans of Halloween III, stop reading and go ahead and order your copy.  For the rest of you, I have to say that I am very impressed with the HD upgrade Shout Factory has done.  No movie from 1982, and certainly not a low-budget horror film, is going to be as sharp as a new movie.  But there are moments in this one that come close to looking brand-new.  A standout scene is when ""Little Buddy"" and his parents visit the Silver Shamrock factory.  The orange of the jack o' lantern masks positively GLOWS.  The film does contain a lot of night shots, and even those aren't overly grainy.  The sound mix also seems right. . .for better or worse, get ready to have the Silver Shamrock jingle lodged in your head all over again!

There's a breezy and informative 33-minute documentary, ""Stand Alone: The Making of Halloween III.""  It's nice to see the original actors like Tom Atkins and Stacey Nelkin, and director Tommy Lee Wallace share fond memories of the production.  No ones takes themselves too seriously, acknowledging the film's failure while still expressing pride at being part of it.  Atkins comes off particularly affable, all the more enlightening since his performance as a leading man is rather dull.

Wallace waxes nostalgic in a sporadically amusing commentary track, while a tour of the film's locations is pretty boring.  Finally, there are the (lame) teaser and full theatrical trailers for the film.  Oddly, even with a decent collection of special featuers, the disc does not have a scene menu that allows you to start the film wherever you want.

Although it may not sway the hardcore haters, this well-done presentation of a cult film should be embraced by the few who ""get"" the film.  And you know, 30 years is a long time. . .I hope that those who might have been ""on the fence"" about it or simply haven't seen the film since 1982 will consider giving it another look.",1349049600,14,2397,4.592941176470588

Yes, for all you HD perfectionists, there is some grain, and there are some artifacts in the darker scenes, but overall it is amazing. The bonus features are great.

837177,3,630428845X,"Very few movie studios are willing to gamble on anything that strays outside of their comfort zones. They all want sure things. That's why we get so many remakes and sequels to movies these days. Their actions aren't without reason. Moviegoers are a fickle bunch. Something that sounds or looks good on paper may not translate well when it finally hits the big screen. Universal Studios and John Carpenter learned that lesson the hard way with ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch.""

With the release of ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" on Blu-ray, horror enthusiasts are given the chance to once again revisit the one and only entry in the franchise that doesn't feature knife-wielding Michael Myers. It would seem like common sense that a movie whose first two entries banked on the masked Myers' teenage killing sprees wouldn't work without him.

However, producers John Carpenter and Debra Hill wanted to move in a different direction and launch an anthology series under the ""Halloween"" banner. Fans protested by simply not seeing the movie. It's still the weakest performer at the box office out of the 10 films in the franchise. However, a cult following has built up around the film over the 30 years since its release, encouraging Shout! Factory to unleash it in high-definition.

Shop owner Harry Grimbridge (Al Berry) is taken to a hospital clutching a Silver Shamrocks brand Halloween mask and cryptically murmuring, ""They're going to kill us. They're going to kill us all."" Dr. Dan Challis (Tom Atkins) becomes more and more suspicious after the man is murdered in his hospital bed by a figure in a three-piece suit who later lights himself on fire.

After Grimbridge's daughter, Ellie (Stacey Nelkin), informs Challis that her father's last stop before his death was at the Silver Shamrock factory in the small Irish town of Santa Maria. The two decide to investigate the sleepy town and see if the factory and its owner (Dan O'Herlihy) and workers have anything to do with the mysterious death of Grimbridge.

""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" is a bit of a mess. I give producers John Carpenter and Debra Hill and director / writer Tommy Lee Wallace kudos for trying something different, but the result is a mish-mash of science fiction and horror genre elements that don't blend well together. Honestly, Dean Cundey's cinematography is the saving grace of the movie. He gives the film way more style and class than the convoluted plot deserves.

It's interesting to see actors like Tom Atkins and Dan O'Herlihy give such strong performances in this low-budget misfire. They both portray their different characters with such strong conviction. The two add another level of professionalism to the movie. Actor Stacey Nelkin plays the young Ellie, who is obviously cast in the film to attract teen guys by her good looks and girls because of her strong spirit and independent drive.

The high-definition transfer of the movie gives viewers the best visual and audio experience they've ever encountered watching this. ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" never looked this good or sounded as full as it does on Blu-ray. John Carpenter and Alan Howarth's eerie electronic score pulsates but the 2.0 sound mix would have benefited from being made fuller by giving it a 5.1 surround facelift.

The bonus material for this Blu-ray edition is going to make horror fans very happy. There are two audio commentaries for the film. One is provided by director / writer Tommy Lee Wallace, Rob G. from ""Icons of Fright,"" and Horror's Hallowed Grounds' Sean Clark. The other includes actor Tom Atkins and DVD Producer Michael Felsher discussing different aspects of the film.

The 33-minute documentary ""Stand Alone: The Making of 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch'"" gives the cast and crew of the film a chance to speak their minds about it candidly and discuss its reception and legacy. The featurette ""Horror's Hallowed Grounds: Revisiting the Original Shooting Locales"" takes us on a tour of all the different filming locations used. Other special features include a still gallery, TV spots, trailer, and reversible cover art.

As a stand-alone film, ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" isn't completely devoid of entertaining and effectively gruesome moments. There's some fun to be had while watching it. Scream Factory's Blu-ray edition of the movie is definitely the only way to go if you want it as cleaned up as it's ever been.

The new Scream Factory edition is so great.  For me, trading in my bargain basement Video Treasures edition for this one was beyond an upgrade; it was a revelation.  It was almost like seeing the film for the first time.  The special features got me wondering what might have been.  Can you imagine if there had been a string of anthology-like unrelated sequels all set at Halloween instead of the pile of crappy Michael Myers sequels and remakes that followed?  It was a grand idea, but the marketing alone seems to have sunk this film.  Billing it as Halloween III set up improper expectations.",1348444800,6,753,4.687022900763359
837179,5,630428845X,"When this movie first came out it was considered a huge flop as everyone wanted to know why this was considered a sequel to Halloween 1 & 2 when it has nothing to do with Michael Myers or the first 2 movies. That was the problem with this movie, when they released it, they should of never called it Halloween 3, it should of just been ""Season of the Witch"", but I believe they obviously knew what they were doing in promoting it as a sequel even using the tag line ""The Night No One Comes Home"" instead of ""The Night He Came Home"", I mean honestly what did they think people would believe when every indication was that it was a direct sequel to the first two.

Originally they wanted to do a different Halloween themed movie every year that centered around the Halloween holiday but audiences were already fans of Michael Myers and wanted more so going to this movie just disappointed everyone's expectations. That aside, this has always been one of my favorite movies, if you look at it as a movie that is not a direct sequel you will definitely enjoy it a lot more. The basic story is about this company that makes Silver Shamrock Halloween masks (with the BEST jingle that you will never get out of your head) but there is obviously something more sinister going on with these masks then meets the eyes. I don't want to give too much away but I always thought it was a great movie that never got the respect it deserved.

We also finally get some bonus features with a making of feature with interviews with the whole cast. The movie looks amazing on blu ray and is most definitely an upgrade to all the previous releases of this movie. If you're a fan of horror movies you should definitely check this out and give the movie a chance, i promise you won't be disappointed.",1348185600,3,1777,4.398176291793313

It is nice to see this movie get the upgraded treatment.  knowing there is always room for more, lets appreciate that we got and HD edition.  Take away that Michael Myers is not part of this movie and I think you will make this a stand alone good flick.

PQ: now it is not a Jaws or Raiders restoration, but it certainly outdoes the Universal DVD.  If you can see the upgrade and the fact that is an HD presentation and the enjoy the improvments.  That should be a joy in itself.  I do not see this getting much better unless universal adds this to there list of major restorations.  I think I will sum it up like this.  Before:The origonal DVD played on a tube TV using S-Video Cable with alot of dust and dirt and fingerprints on the screen.  After: watching it on a HD TV/Bluray player with a HDMI cable and using Audioquest clean screen on the monitor before watching.  Addiong a video technician using a liquid to clean the print before watching.  Thats about as simple as I can explain it.

Audio: as most has mentioned a DTS 2.0 HD master track.  For a movie with not alot of pounding action, but with more scary drama, everything sounds clean dialogue is clear and the music gets some LFE sounds. As the same as mentioned above, a big improvment from the previous  DVD edition.  Simple put, I don't think this movie would benefit much if it was given a 5.1 or 7.1 audio upgrade, in this case it was much better to go with the 2.0.  It probaly would've made more fans of this movie have that much more disapoinment, when the audio could not deliver on a 5.1 mix.  Thank you again Shout Factory for making us H3 fans smile more when we play this Blu ray.

Special features: I was very happy with the Doc. since there is not much info on this movie out there.  the doc on the locations was also very imformative and detailed in showing what was and is currently.  It gave us an insight into the little film that we enjoy so much.

Wanting more: As fans of the Halloween franchise.  Some us love H20 or love resurection, but hate 3 or hate 5.  We have our favorites and dislikes about each.  And we always want more and often times the studios don't deliver.  Studios keep issuing the ulimate edition.  But some how every few years it keeps getting issued as such and no one is completly satisfied. I myself was hoping for some of the extended scenes or deleted scenes mention is some of the innerviews recently on H3.  BTW there should not of been a No Nipple clause in Staceys Nelkins contract, horror movies always need a bit of nudity.  When she drppoed her towel a quick topless shot would not of hurt.  I guess she did not have a no bush clause in there though.  and all this a solid upgrade from cover to cover, upgraded audio and picture and a couple of new doc's.  that probaly would never been done unless Shout Factory had done this.  Most of us always find a way to complain about an edition of our favorite flicks, but I guess that just makes us passoniate fans.  This edition of H3 BR is really nice and it probaly will not get a double dip, so lets enjoy the upgrades an appreciate that we even got a collectors edition. I guess we will always want more no matter how much we get, thats just makes us fans...Mike S.  PS, lets hope we get a nice 35th BR of the origonal this year",1348099200,4,3381,4.269291338582677

Most of the DVD transfers I have seen have been quite sub-par.  It seemed that they took full screen footage and added black bars at the top and the bottom to emulate widescreen.  Also the transfer of the film itself was grainy and a little muddy at parts.  It's also a no frills DVD.  No real special features.

The Blu-ray version changes everything.

The transfer from the original source is magnificent.  A fantastic restoration job.  Everything is crisp and clear, even in the darker scenes.  Also, the sound has had a significant bump.  There are actually special features this time!  You get ""Stand Alone:  The Making of Halloween III:  Season of the Witch"", which has interviews with the key cast and director.

837185,4,630428845X,"What is it about this movie?

When this came out back in the early 1980s, I had little interest in it.  I eventually saw it on VHS and did not like it. . .and like many fans of the original Halloween, I wondered why on earth Carpenter, Hill, et al. had moved in a different artistic direction with this movie.

About ten years ago or so I caught this on A&E (or some other cable network) during October.  I watched it again and at that point I was infected with whatever cult-hit magic this film has that continues to suck in viewers.  Look at the growing number of reviews for this movie!  There is something timeless about this film. . .and something indefinable that injects it with a quintessential feeling of the Halloween season. . .at least the dark, spooky (and a little silly) side of the season.  The storyline is admittedly absurd, the plot has more than its share of holes, and there are a couple of gratuitous killing scenes that almost tend to detract from the ongoing feel of the film.  At the same time, this film feels like Halloween. . .like the darker side of the season, the fictional side, the black cats, witches and glowing pumpkins side. . .more so than any of the Michael Myers films ever do.  Do not misunderstand me, the first film of the Halloween series - and perhaps even the second - are technically superior films in their construction and execution - and they are both arguably scarier and more believable. . .but there is something about this film.  There is something about the irritating mask commercials, something about the little town of Santa Mira and something about beer guzzling, everyman ""Dan Challis"" that sucks you in.  I have now watched this film more times than any other entry in the series.

Now every October I pop in a DVD of this film and take a trip down an 80s memory lane. . .one that went from completely irrelevant to highly entertaining.  Happy, happy Halloween!

Blu-ray update:  Obviously I am a fan of this film, so I picked up the Shout! Factory Blu-ray.  The transfer is not quite as good as some of the other reviews would lead you to believe, nor is the DTS-HD 2.0 audio track likely to strain any home theaters. . .but the sound is a vast improvement over earlier home versions and the HD looks pretty good overall.  Some scenes really pop, such as the farmer in the green John Deere cap who Dan Challis and Ellie Grimbridge pass while traveling to Santa Mira.  Most of the imperfections in the sourced film have been removed, but the film has, unfortunately, been a little over-corrected.  Faces occasionally lack a lot of detail.  Actress Stacy Nelkin's (Ellie) facial features suffer the worst - looking polished and white in several scenes.  Tom Atkins (Dan) also looks a little pasty more than once, though perhaps not quite as bad.  That said, this is an improvement over the MonstersHD version some of you may have caught on Dish Network several years ago when that incredibly cool station was still available.  The main menu of the disc is well done and full motion, featuring nicely spliced HD clips from the film.  (Who doesn't appreciate full motion disc menus?)  It also contains a fleet of extras and a couple commentary tracks.  It's not among the very best HD transfers considering the over-correction, but it is a huge leap over previously released versions.  I highly recommend it, especially if you enjoy this tastey and controversial Halloween treat.",1341187200,15,3437,4.656716417910448
837226,4,630428845X,"First off, let me just say I really like Halloween 3. The reason why I became such a huge fan of the Halloween films was because of the Halloween marathon AMC has every year. But when Halloween 3 came on, I was confused. I thought, 'why the hell is Michael Myers not in it?' He was in the first 2 films along with 4,5,6,7, and 8. He was also in 2 remakes. So why wasn't Michael in this one? Well it turns out they were going for a different Halloween theme story every time. Now that that's cleared, let me get to the point why I'm actually typing this. Everyone puts this movie down because Michael Myers isn't in it. Who cares about him? He's just a big, sweaty oaf who wanders around stalking babysitters with big boobies while being dressed up like William Shatner. Halloween 3 is at least more original than the first 2 with cyborgs that can rip off people's heads, masks that can kill innocent children, warlocks, and lazers. Is that not awesome or what? Now I'm not saying this movie is better than the first 2, just more original. But what's really annoying is people who haven't even watched the film take a dump on it. They just assume it's bad because Michael Myers isn't in it. So what he's not in it? Lastly, I'd like to note this. You know how they were going for a different halloween story every time? Well let's just assume Halloween 3 was the first in the series. Everyone would love it. But when the one with Michael Myers would come out, everyone would hate it because it was ""different."" I know it's not the best movie in the world, and I know John Carpenter and Debra Hill could've worked harder on it, but it's still a fun thrill ride. Now that you've heard this, maybe the people who give this movie shit will actually watch it and end up loving it.

837228,4,630428845X,"HALLOWEEN 3: THE SEASON OF THE WITCH is the only sequel that doesn't revolve around Michael Myers since HALLOWEEN III focuses on an investigation by an alcoholic down-on-his-luck surgeon Dr. Challis(Tom Atkins)into the activities of a wicked warlock Conal Cochran(Daniel O'Herlihy)whom is the mysterious owner of a Silver Shamrock Novelties company in a fictional small remote town in Northern California called Santa Mira which was mostly filmed in the small coastal town of Loleta, CA.

Since writers John Carpenter & Debra Hill were reluctant about making a 3rd installment of the HALLOWEEN saga; Carpenter & Hill only agreed to participate if HALLOWEEN 3 wasn't a direct sequel to HALLOWEEN 2, which meant no Michael Myers, no obsessed Dr. Loomis(Donald Pleasance), no hapless victim Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis), no Sheriff Brackett(Charles Cyphers), and no Haddonfield, Illinois.

Therefore HALLOWEEN 3 departs from the slasher film genre which was spawned by the original HALLOWEEN in 1978 since HALLOWEEN 3 features a ""mad scientist"" theme for the villian instead of Michael Myers being the villian since the producers apparently felt that the Michael Myers character was getting tired and needed a rest and felt it was time for a change by having this HALLOWEEN sequel take place on the West Coast instead of the Midwest, especially since Michael Myers presumably died off along with Dr. Loomis in HALLOWEEN 2 which by the way was released in the Fall of 1981.

Therefore, the producers had also changed the slogan for HALLOWEEN III to ""The Night Nobody Comes Home"" which was the opposite to the slogan used in the original HALLOWEEN which was ""The Night He Came Home"".

Unfortunately, HALLOWEEN 3 had bombed at the box office since this thriller was produced on a budget of $2.5 million dollars, but only grossed $14.4 million at the box office during its release in the Fall of 1982 being rated the poorest performing HALLOWEEN sequel & was given very negative reviews by critics, unlike the original HALLOWEEN which had broken new ground in the Fall of 1978 and was imitated by many genre films following its wake.

Therefore, Six years later after HALLOWEEN 3's release, the producers had decided to bring Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis back when they finally released HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS in the Fall of 1988 by revising the story around a little bit by having Michael Myers go back to Haddonfield on Halloween night of 1988 after being in a coma for 10 years and that Michael Myers & Dr. Loomis had nearly burned to death in the hospital fire on Halloween night of 1978 instead of actually dying off.

Something else I noticed was Nancy Loomis who played Dr. Challis's ex-wife(Linda Challis)in HALLOWEEN 3: THE SEASON OF THE WITCH was also the same gal who played Laurie's smart-aleck friend(Annie Brackett)in HALLOWEEN I and Dick Warlock which played one of Cochran's androids in HALLOWEEN III had played Michael Myers in HALLOWEEN II.",1339718400,7,2972,5.030487804878049

Plot: On Saturday, October 23rd a shop owner is found running scarred from an unknown evil, that night after he is submitted into a hospital, that unknown evil (which is basically a man in a business suit) kills him.... Now the doctor who saw him that night and saw the unholy terror in his eyes must piece together the facts of what really happened with help from the shop owner's daughter... They soon discover that a mad genius named Conal Cochran is using his latest best seller (which is three kinds of Halloween masks) to put a spell on the children that leads to there heads being turned into a pile of snakes and insects!... It will all go down on October 31st, Halloween!

Review: With its $2,500,000 budget Tommy Lee Wallace, John Carpenter, and Deborah Hill thought up a marvelous plot and turned it into something interesting! Although there are a lot of plot holes and the story itself is a bit cheesy it still manages to scare me just as much as the trailer did and on a scale from 1-10 on the scare factor it's about a 2 which is good because not all movie cant even make it to my scare factor! This movie made $14 million which is a minor success but it is still the second lowest grossing Halloween movie of the series, the first being Halloween 5! I still love the fact that they released this on October 22nd because then it basically takes place one day after its release! The deaths were graphic and the intense scenes where pretty much just jump scares but all in all the film is decent!

Acting: ""Happy Halloveen"" I love how Cochran (Dan O' Herlilhy) says that or at least that's how it sounds... The other actor whom I thought were great was Tom Atkins ""The Fog (1980)"", the rest of the actors in my opinion were only decent!

Gore: a head ripped off (leading to blood-spray), a groovy crushed skull, a disturbing scene involving one of the masks and snakes/insects, a melted lower half of a face, and some more... it was over all gory and horrific but it could've used some more.. But the atmosphere sure does make up for it!

Bottom Line: It would've been a hit for sure if they had just changed the ""Halloween III"" part in the title but I do know that they wanted to start fresh and I give them credit for that and more! It is a good buy and an even better Halloween treat to those die hard horror fans!

No Michael Meyers roving around in a dirty gas station uniform with a William Shatner mask and a butcher knife trying to kill as many teenagers in the town as he can.

837305,1,630428845X,"Halloween III: Season of the Witch
1982 / 96 min. / Rated R

After Halloween II's success, a third film was inevitable, but no one was quite prepared for it. The second film was intended to conclude the story of Michael Myers, so Halloween III: Season of the Witch was to be the start of Halloween-related pics instead of focusing on one continuous storyline. John Carpenter and Debra Hill would return as producers with Tommy Lee Wallace agreeing to direct this time around. Nigel Kneale, writer of the Quartermass series, was signed on to pen the script. His take, however, left Dino De Laurentiis displeased, and Wallace revised the script to include more graphic shocks. Kneale would ultimately have his name removed from the film.

Like its predecessor, Halloween III was budgeted at $2.5 million and was shot in various cities in California. The shoot went without a hitch, and the film would open on October 22nd 1982 against the original Rambo film, First Blood. Suffice it to say, Halloween III would debut at #2 with an opening of $6.3 million on its way to a disappointing $14.4 million. This would equate to over $35 million to today's ticket prices.

The Michael Myers-less plot centers on Dr. Dan Challis, played by character actor Tom Atkins, who investigates a series of bizarre incidences that leads him to Silver Shamrock, a mass-producer of Halloween masks and their evil plan to kill children across the globe by somehow using stolen pieces of Stonehenge and attaching them to the masks. It is discovered while wearing these masks; the children will all but be destroyed when they watch the Silver Shamrock advertisements on TV. The plot is certainly as silly as it sounds since much of it doesn't make a lick of sense. The script is certainly this film's Achilles heel.

Much of the cast is newcomers to the franchise with the exceptions of bit roles by Nancy Kyes, Dick Warlock, and Jamie Lee Curtis, who appeared unbilled for some voice over work. The new cast of actors includes the aforementioned Tom Atkins, as well as Stacey Nelkin and one-time Academy Award nominee, Dan O'Herlihy. For the most part, they all deliver serviceable performances, but the characters have no spark. The film is often dull because of this, and when its not, it's too busy being illogical. Some of the film's best assets, however, include the new musical score by Carpenter and Alan Howarth, the infectious Silver Shamrock jingle and the film's use of sound effects. I should also state that Wallace actually does a nice job with the various shot selections that echo the styling's of its predecessors which is helped mightily by the fact that Dean Cundey had returned to serve as DP on the project.

Fans of this film often cite the reason people do not like it is because there's no Michael Myers. While I think it was an ill-conceived idea, it was made even worse by the fact there is no real connection to the previous two films beyond that. Halloween III doesn't take place in Haddonfield but in a fictional Northern California city called Santa Mira which is straight from the classic 1956 film, Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Even elements of its plot are closer to that film than the previous two Halloween movies. There's no carry over of any characters, and to make matters worse, the original Halloween is referenced as just being a movie. That aside, that's not why I dislike this film, there is a whole laundry list of reasons why. I will do my best covering them all.

The most glaring issues with the film are the multitude of plot holes that pile on scene after scene. For one, how did Cochran - the owner of the Silver Shamrock Company - steal a piece of Stonehenge that weighed over 5 tons? Why does Stonehenge even have such deadly powers? How do that and the TV ad work in conjunction with one another? How does this unleash bugs and snakes from the inside of the masks? And if the plan is for the ad to run at 9pm, wouldn't time zone changes destroy his evil plot? And what are Cochran's motives exactly? With such a grandiose, albeit convoluted, plot - shouldn't we know why he's doing this? The only answer we're really offered is when Cochran states, ""A good magician never explains."" Or perhaps a more fitting line would be, ""a better screenwriter would've made more sense"". And then there's just the plan silly stuff like; Silver Shamrock is so successful to sell millions of masks across the country and yet they only sell 3 different masks? There are so many questions with no real answers. Why this film is even called ""Season of the Witch"" is yet another head scratcher.

In the end result, this film is just not good. Whether it's called Halloween or not, there is no saving this turkey. This was a bad idea that wielded the expected results.  If you like androids and unexplained killer masks with unknown motives behind the villain, then you may enjoy this - otherwise, feel free to skip to the next installment.",1317427200,10,4951,4.70242214532872

837358,5,630428845X,This is one of my favourite films of the 1980s.  It is a fine dark horror film with a symbolistic fairy story built into it which depicts TV destroying childhood and children's minds.

837361,4,630428845X,"Halloween III: Season of the Witch has the very unfair advantage of being the worst in the Halloween series and is also brandished as one of the poorest horror films and sequels ever. Fact of the matter, its a great movie with a horrifying concept. John Carpenter who was a true artist couldn't stand doing the same movie over and over again, and was only involved with Halloween II to get the money he didn't make for the first film. He wanted to take it into a new dirction, bringing in Nigel Kneal who wrote the Quatermass and the Pit films from the 60's, also a famous British sci-fi writer, they had the best intentions here.

Spoilers ahead: the film centers around an old business man tycoon who is actually a warlock that wants to take Halloween back to its roots, by creating masks that carry the power of witchcraft which are being mass marketed to all the kids which at a certain time will set off a device in the masks which causes mass death and chaos. He uses Halloween against itself so to speak. Thus taking the world back to its barbaric times. When you really think about it this is a pretty evil and dark concept. Of course you, the viewer aren't giving this information and its left to Tom Atkins (Escape from NY) , a doctor and a victim of the tycoon's daughter to trace down whats really going on as suspicious things pop up. Of course when the movie came out, it was automatically branded a turkey because there was no Michael Myers. Strangely enough, doing something original is looked down upon by mainstream film goers who are interested in a product, which Myers was fast becoming and the Halloween name itself becoming a brand.

The man who's overseen the entire franchise Moustapha Akkad has said he was against the idea of this movie but of course he would be, his brand name wasn't involved in it. When you really think about it, whats so bad about the movie? It has a decent mystery and a surefire plot, fine acting and some chilling suspense along with some shocking bloodshed scenes. It wasn't a masterpiece but somehow...the simple fact that it doesnt follow exactly the same formula the other films doesnt automatically make it a bad movie. Friday the 13th part V, released two years after this is considered the worst of that series, mainly because its revealed Jason isn't really the killer, however no one knew that till the end. But its still a slasher movie with lots of predictable plot lines, bad acting, breasts, and violence. Whats going on here?

Regardless of what some fans say, don't miss out on Halloween III. It really is a great movie. More than likely if it had been called something else it woulda been a success thus continuing a new series of Halloween themed films with a diff story, which was Carpenter and producer Debra Hill's idea. Sure, Michael Myers is great but its a shame that to think of what coulda been, in light of what we have, an ok Halloween 4, terrible Halloween 5, a very dark and semi decent Halloween 6, and a horrible Halloween Ressurection. With only two watchable sequels following part 3, (those being 4 and Halloween H20). Was it really worth it. Dont follow the crowd on this flick, it has its fans. Check out Season of the Witch on Halloween night.",1287100800,3,3232,4.559380378657487
837362,4,630428845X,"In ""Halloween III,"" Tom Atkins plays a doctor who becomes alert to odd goings-on, involving a company that makes scary Halloween masks. He follows the clues to an obscure coastal California town, where the mysterious company is based. Joined by one of the 80's great babes, Stacy Nelkin, he eventually ferrets out the evil truth behind the demonic masks... but are they too late?

If you are prepared for the fact that this movie has NOTHING to do with the first two ""Halloween"" films, you should be able to relax and have fun watching this. It makes no sense that they even named it ""Halloween III"" -- just try to get past that irritating fact. Writer, director, and composer John Carpenter's fantastic musical score is guaranteed to give you the uber-willies, as usual. And Tom Atkins is really good -- he did several films with John Carpenter. They seem to have worked well together. An interesting fact -- Stacy Nelkin once dated Woody Allen, and their relationship was the basis of the unusual film ""Manhattan.""

I was about 12 or 13 when I first saw this movie. I was confused about some things, at the time, when I saw this. Why is the coastal California town populated by evil Irish people? I'm part Irish. I thought maybe I should be offended. Well, in case some young person out there has the same confused reaction I did -- John Carpenter is trying to emphasize the (real) connection between our holiday Halloween, and the ancient Celtic festival called ""Samhain."" The Irish are considered Celtic -- the word ""Celtic"" is sort of an old, blanket ethnic term, referring to the ancestors of Irish, Welsh, and Breton people, along with several other ethnic groups. If you'd like to learn a little more about the Celts, and about Samhain (along with other, less sinister holidays and festivals celebrated by the Celts) I would like to recommend that you read ""The Celts"" by T.G.E. Powell. You might also enjoy ""Celtic Heritage: Ancient Tradition in Ireland and Wales,"" by Alwyn Rees.

Toss in a charming but severely warped old Irishman bent on playing a trick on the children via technological witchcraft, and you have the makings of a terrifyingly chilling and nearly feasible modern plot.

Once I come to terms that this is an entirely stand-alone package, I have to say ""Season of the Witch"" has some interesting ideas but it's overall underwhelming.

It had a good mystery element in the beginning.  A frantic survivor tried to escape from a fleet of business suits but was rescued by a womanizing ex-husband doctor inside a hospital, only to be killed by a business suit by ripping off his skull (impractical, but hey, it's horror).  The doctor wanted to know what's going on, and with the help of the victim's daughter/love-interest, they travel to an Irish village in America after discovering clues to find out the connection between the victim and an mask-making company, Silver Shamrock.  They skulk around the area while making love when there's nothing do, until they discovered Silver Shamrock's biggest conspiracy.  Then the movie went from being a intriguing horror mystery to a confusing sci-fi hostile cultfest with robots and subliminal TV ads that turns kids wearing their patented masks into bugs and snakes.

There's this whole plan about making the kids around the watch their ads and becoming sacrificial lambs, although I don't think the bad guy of the movie ever thought about time zone differences, or the fact that most countries don't celebrate the holiday or have TVs; matter of fact, what kind of kids are interested in televised advertisements?  Plot holes aside, at least it's decently gorey for a horror film.  The scene that impressed me the most was that scene where a hotel lady found a Shamrock pin with a computer chip on the floor, and when she mess with the chip...well, let's just say she was blinded by the light.  It does have some inane moments, like how the business suits just stood out at the factory unaware at how suspicious they are, and the movie doesn't really explain how the robots were made or how a certain victim even became one (did they threw away the body?  Surgically inserted robot parts?).

As far as horrors go, ""Season of the Witch"" is serviceable but pretty lackluster.  It's like the movie had a full story but it was cut in half so the other half can be used for part two, which never happened. If only it had a name change.",1276560000,,2820,5.034408602150537
837366,3,630428845X,"This film is given lots of bad press, as the worst sequel of this franchise, mostly because it doesn't connect itself to the saga of Michael Myers. But while that might be an unfair bias against the film, it is hardly without many flaws of it's own, that hinder it from being a great scary film.

The biggest problem within the film, is lack of giving proper amounts of information to make something convincing. When the doctor (played solidly by Tom Atkins) shows signs that he has feelings for Ellie (played by Stacey Nelkin) and sleeps with her, it seems to come out of nowhere. There is no build up to it, nothing to indicate that they would feel that way for each other, as they've only just met over the course of a day. Later, when the doctor frees Ellie from captivity and they race to stop the broadcasts, Ellie is revealed to be one of the robots of the evil Silver Shamrock company. But how long has that been the case? Was she one all along? Why didn't she deactivate, when they blew up the factory, like the other ones did? There are just so many things like this, that it takes you out of the moment and you lose a lot of the tension the film should be generating.

That isn't to say the film has nothing good about it. The performances by Tom Atkins and Dan O'Herlihy (as the villain of the piece) are very engaging, especially when they are on-screen together. O'Herlihy brilliantly captures that sense of quiet evil with his performance, as he's all smiles and charm one minute, then the heart of darkness the next. Atkins is great as the reluctant hero, who is clearly in over his head. Also, the musical score is top notch (not surprising, as it comes from John Carpenter). It is very eerie and constantly give you the feeling of dread. Even the jingle to the Silver Shamrock television ad can give you the spooks.

Still, despite all that, the film ultimately suffers from some very poor script writing and lack of proper explanations. It takes what could have been one of the all-time classic scare films and turns it into a mediocre effort, that should have been thought-out more.

This isn't really a bad movie, but the flaws within it keep it from being truly good. I applaud the makers for trying something different. And while the film should not be snubbed for that, it has plenty of it's own issues that lessen the appeal of it. As loathe as I am of remakes, I actually think this film could benefit from such, provided the script writing was up to par. As it stands, the film is merely watchable. Perhaps something to watch late at night, when you can't sleep. Sadly, it could have been so much more.",1273363200,,2629,4.45945945945946

837428,1,630428845X,"""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" is misleading from the start. It has nothing to do with any of the other installations of ""Halloween,"" nor does it feature a witch. Given the title is that deceptive, could the movie be much better? The answer is a resounding no, but could be immensely worse. This is one of the most incoherent, most poorly conceived horror movies ever made, and I am stunned that John Carpenter would have his name anywhere close to it, although in fairness six people get some kind of producer credits, including Moustapha Akkad (who was also involved in several other films in the tapped-out ""Halloween"" series,) and Irwin Yablans (who was an executive producer involved with ""Halloween,"" and less-fortunately with ""Nocturna: Granddaughter of Dracula,"" and even worse, ""Roller Boogie."") When I saw the Yablans name, I was instantly terrified, but for all the wrong reasons.

""Halloween III"" stars Tom Atkins and Stacey Nelkin (who?) as Dr. Dan Challis, and Ellie Grimbridge, an unlikely 1980's low-budget movie duo investigating Ellie's father's death at the hand of a corporate robot. The plot involves many things, but boils down to America being haunted by a subliminal pumpkin via the medium of television on Halloween. Also prominently involved is a Halloween song to the tune of ""London Bridge is Falling Down,"" a song that is replayed almost constantly throughout the movie. There are some amusing cultural references in the movie, my favorite being the empty bar with a television airing a commercial for the original ""Halloween"" where Dr. Challis and Ellie rendezvous. Never put a reference to a good movie in a bad movie. (Don't believe me? Go watch ""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank."")

Dan and Ellie quickly focus on the Silver Shamrock Halloween mask factory and it's CEO, Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy,) who gives by far the best performance in the movie as a sort of cross between a leprechaun and Tony Soprano. We also meet the Kupfers, an idiotic couple from San Diego and their loathsome son; Buddy Kupfer is a Halloween mask salesman, and the second they drive into frame in their Winnebago (nearly running over Dan) you will be looking forward to their demise. After an ultra-embarrassing love scene, we discover that a medallion on the back of masks can accidentally misfire, melt your face off with a laser beam, and make scarab beetles come out of your mouth. How it does this is never clear, but it somehow involves Stonehenge. (More on this in a moment.)

Cochran has a bunch of robotic assassins who enforce his iron will, have great forearm strength, and are experts at using cordless drills. The Kupfers, Dan, and Ellie get a tour of the Silver Shamrock plant from Cochran and his robotic minions, who apprehend Ellie, experiment on the weak-minded Kupfers causing snakes and crickets to emerge from their son's head, ultimately killing them all, and finally capture Dan, resorting to that great bad-movie plot device in which the arch-criminal tells the hero exactly how he does what he does, so to invite defeat. This is a more ambiguous case though, because nothing that is said makes a lick of sense, and the plot gets more random as it goes on. (I'm pretty sure the question ""How do we end this thing?"" must have come up more than once.)

Cochran explains that the secret is related to a giant sacred stone megalith that he stole (somehow) from Stonehenge and brought to rural California. That was quite a logistical feat for nobody to notice. Through a bunch of computers, subliminal television ads, the annoying song, and the medallions affixed on the back of masks, Cochran will fulfill his destiny to have a huge child sacrifice on Halloween because the planets are in alignment for the first time in 3,000 years. Instead of just killing Dan like an ordinary enemy, they, of course, put a mask on him and make him watch television until it's time for his head to turn to snakes and insects. He outwits them, escapes, and recaptures Ellie. He has a cunning plan which involves re-programming the computer that sends the television commercials, and sprinkling the medallions down into the electronics of the Stonehenge control station that shorts them out, makes everyone (including the robots) die, and the megalith excrete a circular laser beam of destruction.

As nonsensical as that is, at least it's the end of the movie. No wait. I'm mistaken, there are ten more minutes left. Actually with the Silver Shamrock factory glowing ambiguously in the background, Dan and Ellie speed away in their maroon Oldsmobile Cutlass, at which point it's revealed that Ellie is now a killer robot too, so they have a car accident and have a fight with various tire-repair tools, resulting in Ellie's death, and that's the end. Sorry, no wait...not so fast. Actually Ellie's dismembered arm is still inside the car and it and Dan wrestle to the death. The end. Oh, hang on...

There are numerous inane false endings, but all you will really want is for it to be over. And it does finally end, in a gas station, and in a way that is wholly predictable, despite the seeming destruction of the Silver Shamrock factory. I won't spoil the ending, because if I had to watch all the way through this incoherent nonsense, so should you.",1271376000,4,5271,4.864142538975501

The real story behind the Halloween movie series (as explained by it's creator, John Carpenter) was supposed to be a series of all completely different halloween horror themed movies.  Then, Hollywood took over, capitalizing on what they saw as a franchise.  So, with that in mind, this is a really cool movie on it's own.  It's just too bad that they followed the original line and don't split this off as it's own stand alone movie.

BTW, Michael does make a special appearance in this one too.  You have to watch closely to see it, but he's in it.  Not as you would think, but he is there, if only for a couple seconds.

This movie alone scared the crap out of me as a kid.  It's truly a disturbing and evil premise.  What a great story never seen before or since.  All the great elements to a creepy story including Halloween, small town, ghosts, witches, demons, hell, wicked technology and terrorizing families and their kids.

The music in this is perfect.  John Carpenter did it again.  As soon as you see the opening scene, you hear the classic synthesizer and know right away your watching a JC film.  It feels like The Thing or Escape From New York or Halloween I for that matter.

The masks are way cool too.  Horror mask marker icon, Don Post created them, just as he did for the ""Shape"" mask.

The only week parts of this film to me are some bad acting and a little slow to build.  Other than that, awesome.

The week parts of this DVD is that there are NO special features!  Nothing.  Not even a trailer.  I'd really like to see this remastered with behind the scenes features, making of, deleted scenes, music scoring and production notes.  Please someone from Hollywood, make this happen.  There are enough of us movie cult followers to support it.  Plus, everyone knows, if a new ""Collectors Series"" DVD comes out, collectors will buy just on that fact.

John Carpenter is and always was ahead of his time.  A true, unique horror movie maker.  It's a part of movie making history that should not be overlooked.

So, to really enjoy this movie, as it's own movie, just watch it as a movie called, Season of the Witch.  You'll appreciate it.

I was pleasantly surprised at just how well done this movie is! It's actually pretty darn horrifying! After seeing this movie, it makes me wish that they continued on this route of making different horror stories in subsequent sequels that perhaps take place on Halloween but don't involve Myers.

This movie stands on its own and can perhaps be thought of as a ""spin-off"" of the other Halloween movies - since we actually see characters in this movie watching the original ""Halloween"" film on TV a couple different times. It doesn't quite exist in the same universe. But that does not make it any less of a good horror story.

It's amazing that people can suspend disbelief and think that an invincible, walking faster than you run, Michael or Jason are stars of great horror flicks and yet still hate this movie. I like Michael Myers, but the fact that he's not here only adds to the depth of this movie since it is not just another slasher film titled Halloween.

The plot was snail-like and goofy, however different it was. And with no Loomis to give the unintentional comedy a bump, this one fell on its face.

While we can respect the fact that this film was following the intended path for the Halloween series(a new film with new ideas, characters, and plots every year) this guy didn't got it. Even a really nice ammount of Ben Tramer couldn't help this one out and make it enjoyable. Looking back, the huge success and brilliance of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B000RIWAVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>&nbsp;ended up actually killing the original intention for the series. How could it not? Once you see Loomis battling Myers, there's no turning back. This one had to be completely awesome for it to be a success and it just was not enjoyable. Not even a little bit. So, just so we can get a little Loomis in the discussion: If you do decide to rent this one, when you return it to your local video store, scream ""HE'S GONE!

If you're ok with the concept john carpenter originally wanted, ""witch"" was to create a diff Halloween theme for each movie, You will like it. Filmed in beautiful loleta CA for most part, this movie is a nice break away from mikey and focuses on the olden days of Halloween. There's a couple plot holes, like the time zone issue in the movie. The ""big give away"" <--(massive murder) happens at  9:00 which would give other 3 time zones long enough to get the ""killer commercial"" off. Also, I don't know why the factory is mass producing masks the day before Halloween when this is a one shot deal. Watch it and you'll understand. It's my favorite despite the plot holes.

837552,5,630428845X,"Very little to add to the others enthusiastic reviews except my personal 5 stars-rating. I do not pretend that movie is perfect. There are some few logic-holes, that cannot be explained in any simple (and therefore satisfying) way. But the idea was just great, something I've never seen anywhere else, and deserved much more favor from the public. The fact that Michael isn't there, compared with the poor, absurd and sometimes silly comebacks of later, should play a positive role in reviewing it. People likes sequels in the slasher-style (Friday 13th is here to prove it), so that could just disregard simple facts like the same Carpenter's advice, the way he decided to kill eventually Michael in the previous movie, and the quest for a totally fresh, original start in the series. The commercial poor results killed the idea, giving way to the notorious sequels where you can save 10 minutes (if any) of good scenes out of 2h, the acting of Donald Pleasance and the soundtrack (but that was mainly the old good Carpenter's stuff). How people could have liked a character (Michael) dumb and dumber at each sequel after the 4th, and wearing such ugly masks (why they could not just retain the original one?????) is a mystery for me (and I am a great fan of the series). Happily, Rob Zombie is doing a great job at last, but that's another story.
In Halloween III, on the other hand, the story was, as said, original, enticing in its evolution toward Cochran's plan, and also much more linked to Samhain's significance and roots; the acting was fairly good (with the exception of Dan O'Herlihy, who was totally GREAT as Cochran), the soundtrack displayed some gems (pick just the main title: it rocks), the fx still good after decades, and the general effect creating some good suspense that is the main target a good horror movie should aim to. I liked it when I first watched it twenty years ago, I liked it much more a few days ago, when I watched it again (I only did not understand why the DVD should NOT bring back the cut scenes: make sure this one has them all, at least). I furthermore deem smartly conceived and nice to see, some small cameos linking with the first two Halloween's movies: you will see Doc. Challis' ex-wife played by Nancy Kyes (Annie in first movie), some shots of Michael chasing Laurie Strode on Tv, and Jamie Lee Curtis (you heard me) in an unaccredited role as the operator's voice frustrating Challis attempts to call for help, and the one announcing curfew in Santa Mira from loudspeakers.
I will also praise for the theatrical poster, that is the best of the series, a real work of art, and a real horror movie poster, that still gives me the thrills.",1244764800,5,2689,4.663157894736842

837554,4,630428845X,"John Carpenter's Halloween and it's entertaining 1981 sequel were smash box office hits. The first 4 installments in the sage are the strongest, and slowly go downhill after. Part 3 is a really good and really original sequel. The film is about a girl who's father gets attacked by someone from a place where he used to work...did he know something that they couldn't let him live knowing about? Yes. Truly the most creative halloween sequel, this one is suspenseful, has a good story, and will creep you out. I liked it more than some of the Michael Myers killing sprees! I'd give it an A- or a B+

It is really good, the only faults are simply there wasn't enough structural horror, and not enough suspense. I mean, there's some, but I would have liked to see more chasings, more mystery and of course more of the scariness we only get glimpses of during the movie. It's a good story. This movie along with Halloween 1 and 2, and of course Tobe Hooper's FUNHOUSE, are some of the best scary story films of that late seventies..early 80's drive through horror phase. It's a movie no horror fan should miss. It's not as constantly scary and suspenseful as the first Halloween, but it's closer than any sequel after this.

837555,5,630428845X,"You thought no further than the strange custom of having Michael Myers wear a mask and go out stalking his victims.....

Halloween.  The franchise of Carpenter.  The last great one took place 29 years ago when the ideas were fresh...with the creativeness of Carpenter and Wallace.

Halloween III......Hmmmmm...Where should I start?  This is a highly entertaining movie that is not a typical slasher movie.  It's different, and that's why I like it.  It's about a warlock (a male witch, hence the subtitle Season Of The Witch) toy manufacturer that for some crazy reason has a plot to kill children who wear his Halloween masks on Halloween night.  The warlock Conal Cochran (played by Dan O'Herlihy) owns Silver Shamrock Novelties in Santa Mira, California.  The masks are rigged with Silver Shamrock trademark emblems that have a computer chip embedded inside them with a magic ingredient (rock particles from Stonehenge) that is activated and goes spastic when children watch a commercial at 9 PM on Halloween night while wearing these rigged masks.  An alcholic doctor, Dan Challis (played by Tom Atkins), finds himself treating a new patient, a novelty store owner, Harry Grimbridge.  Harry Grimbridge had discovered Silver Shamrocks' plot to kill children on Halloween night and was no doubt going to tell the authorities.  He is being chased by androids from the Silver Shamrock factory.  However, he never makes it to the authorities.  Instead, he collapses at a gas station during a rain storm.  He is taken to the hospital where he is treated by Dr. Challis.  Moments later he is killed by an android.  In a nutshell, Dr. Challis unexpectedly teams up with Grimbridge's daughter, Ellie (played by Stacy Nelkin) to try to find out why Grimbridge was murdered.  They end up driving to Santa Mira, California to investigate the Silver Shamrock factory.  While there, they run into danger and are hunted by Cochran's androids.  Cochran's best salespeople are a wacky couple with a disrespectful son.  They provide comic relief, but little do they know they're also in danger.  The movie really starts to pick up around the 32 minute mark, but the best part of the movie is the last twenty minutes or so, and especially the ending.  The ending leaves you with question marks.  Also look for Maidie Norman (What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?) in this movie.  Now for some in-depth analysis in my defense of this movie.

I like Halloween III much better than all the other sequels in the Halloween series.  John Carpenter and Debra Hill had a great movie in Halloween (1978).  They were pressured into making a sequel, so they reluctantly made Halloween II (1981) because they really didn't want to make it.  Michael Myers dies at the end of Halloween II, and that was meant to end the two-movie saga.  They then proceeded to go in a whole new direction with Halloween III (1982) and their goal was to make a Halloween-themed movie every year that is totally unrelated to the previous movie, sort of like Tales From The Crypt or The Twilight Zone series.  Halloween III was the first movie of this new direction.  After Halloween III bombed, Carpenter and Hill ended the Halloween series because they refused to do another movie with Michael Myers in it when they were pressured to do so.  So there were a total of three movies -- Halloween, Halloween II, and Halloween III.  That was in 1982.  Then what happened?  By 1982 sequels were being made to Friday The 13th, etc., where the villain keeps coming back in movie after movie because he never dies.  Same thing with the A Nightmare On Elm Street franchise.  Freddie Krueger keeps coming back in sequel after sequel.  Between 1982 and 1988 there were so many sequels being done to horror movies.  By this time Carpenter and Hill were long gone, so Moustapha Akkad took over and resurrected the series on his own.  What did he do?  He realized that he could resurrect Michael Myers (who burned to death in Halloween II) because he saw that the other horror movie franchises were bringing back the same invincible villains in sequel after sequel (like Jason and Freddie Krueger).  It was an opportunity to cash in on Michael Myers by bringing him back in Halloween 4 (1988).  So really Jason and Freddie are partially responsible for the resurrection of Michael Myers in Halloween 4 (1988), Halloween 5 (1989), Halloween 6 (1995), Halloween H2O (1998), and Halloween Resurrection (2002), and the fact that Michael Myers never seems to die.  If it wasn't for these invincible villains (and others I didn't mention) appearing in sequel after sequel, Michael Myers' last movie appearance would have been in Halloween II (1981).  This is just one reason why I like Halloween III, because it is DIFFERENT than the same old Michael Myers, a villain that should have never appeared again after Halloween II.  He only appeared in 1988 and beyond because of the opportunity to cash in, to ALL OF A SUDDEN have an INVINCIBLE villain to match other horror movie villains and their respective franchises.  Michael Myers was never meant to be invincible when Carpenter made the first movie.  That's why the Halloween series is so screwed up.  When John Carpenter wrote the script for Halloween II, he threw in that stuff about Laurie Strode being Michael Myers' sister.  That was a sign of the era.  No doubt John Carpenter borrowed from George Lucas in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) -- ""Luke, I am your father."" In 1981, Laurie Strode is Michael's sister.  A SUDDEN shocking twist.  Hmmmm.  By the way, I also believe that John Carpenter borrowed from George Lucas in the first Halloween (1978) when he included the breathing sound in Michael Myers' mask, just like Darth Vader breathed into his mask in Star Wars (1977).  No disrespect to John Carpenter, though.

I think the fact that Halloween II was made was the biggest mistake John Carpenter made because this meant that Michael Myers was in the first TWO movies.  It caused all the narrow-minded people to assume that Michael Myers would appear in every future sequel.  When Michael Myers was absent from Halloween III, people freaked out, not realizing that Michael's days were over in Halloween II.  Also, the fact that Myers was shot six times in Halloween and walked away fine....... then burned in Halloween II.......maybe people thought he'd walk away from that, also.  That's why Carpenter's decision to cave in to movie executives and make Halloween II was a mistake.  Besides, it was just a continuation of the night, anyway.  It was the same story as the first movie with some added twists, only it took place later on that night.  John Carpenter collects royalties from the Halloween sequels that have been made from 1988 onward that he wasn't involved in.  What he actually THINKS of the sequels, well, that's another story.

Halloween III is an underrated movie that people just don't give a chance because they can't get Michael Myers out of their heads.  The public sees Halloween III as a movie that ""doesn't even have Michael Myers in it,"" but all the other Halloween movies do.  Well, what I described above are the reasons.  It would pay for people to pay attention to release dates of movies and the overall timeline of this stuff in order to logically connect the dots and see the patterns that have developed over the years, but unfortunately people don't do this.  Instead, people have negative views of this movie, for example, even though a lot of people who put down this movie have NEVER EVEN SEEN IT simply because there's no Michael Myers.

Halloween III is a good movie that stands by itself if people will just forget about Michael Myers.  Give it a chance.  It's far from perfect.  It has a lot of mistakes in it.  But so does Halloween I.  Also, some of the things you'll see in this movie will make you laugh and question why certain characters are doing the things they are doing at certain times.  Some of these things defy logic.  There are also a number of other things and situations that don't make any sense.  I could give examples, but I'll leave it to you to notice these things.  However, I must give my opinion on something I've heard people point out and complain about over the years:  People always seem to question why Dr. Dan Challis would run off with a total stranger, Ellie Grimbridge, and drive to Santa Mira, California to investigate Silver Shamrock Novelties.  Here's the reason:  He has a guilty conscience because of Harry Grimbridge's death occurring on his watch.  He was taking a nap in the break room of the hospital when the murder happened.  His face clearly shows guilt later on when Ellie visits the hospital.

Even with the mistakes, in my opinion Halloween III is far better than the other sequels in the Halloween series, and is even better than a lot of horror movies that have been made over the years.  I highly recommend this movie for open minded people who aren't obsessed with Michael Myers.  One of the best things I like about this movie is that it touches on the ancient pagan and Celtic origins of Halloween 3,000 years ago in what is now Ireland.  Conal Cochran's ""Halloween speech"" about ""the festival of Samhain"" is my favorite scene in the movie.  This is a great movie to watch late on Halloween night after the trick-or-treaters have gone home and the jack-o-lantern has been extinguished.  This movie gets major points for being original and not being a run-of-the-mill slasher movie.  Listen for Jamie Lee Curtis's voice throughout the movie.  If you end up not liking the movie, I think you'll at least like the soundtrack.  It is awesome, and it gives the movie a really eerie atmosphere.  John Carpenter teamed up with Alan Howarth to create a really eerie and highly effective soundtrack.

When I do my own Horrorthon by watching several scary movies on Halloween night, this is the one that I always watch last.  By the time I watch this, it's the early morning hours of November 1st.  The trick-or-treaters have been home for hours and hours and the jack-o-lantern has been extinguished for hours and hours.

See the movie.  Give it a chance.  Watch it with a fair and open mind.  This DVD's picture and sound quality pass the test.

I'm glad you'll be able to watch it.

In other words...""they"" were going to drop the Micheal Myers story after 2 and move on to other things...

People either didn't catch on or just didn't like the idea, and this movie became a lost cause...

I, personally, love this movie...I've seen it more time than any of the other Halloweens...and personally think that its story and acting rise FAR ABOVE the ridiculous re-openings to the Micheal Myers story (parts 4, 5 and ""Curse"") They should have either stopped the M.M. story at 2 or forgotten about 4, 5, and 6 and left the story at 1, 2, H20 and Resurrection...(If you watch them in that order, there is nothing missing from any of the plot...hmm...maybe someone got smart and tried to forget about the 3 sequels that should've never existed...)

  Laurie Strode and Michael Myers were both in the psychiatric hospital when ""Halloween III - Season of the Witch"" was filmed.  They needed a rest.  This shouldn't keep you from watching this underrated gem that serves up more gore and tension than its predecessors.  Millions of innocent lives are threatened throughout the country in this conspiracy horror film.

  Instead of Michael Myers, we have another madman who is a Druid, Conal Cochran, who owns a toy factory, Silver Shamrock Novelties.  This factory is an evil version of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.  It is producing novelties of horror intent on killing children.  Cochran owns the town of Santa Mira where the factory is located.  It has a six o'clock curfew and cameras monitor everyone's movement and, instead of oomph oopas, an army of killer androids operate the machinery.

  ""Halloween III"" has quite a bit of suspense and tension.  As the hours and seconds tick by, the viewer is drawn closer to an impending disaster.  A doctor and his young girlfriend struggle to stop the impending calamity.  Will they be too late?

  This high tech, conspiratorial horror film  is highly recommended for those who love small towns with big, deadly secrets.

Most people condemn this movie for the simple reason that Michael Myers was not featured. As I've read, the original plan of the producers was to make a new Halloween story every year since Michael Myers ""died"" at the end of Halloween II. Since this film wasn't received well, Michael was brought back in Halloween 4, a worthy sequel to the first film. It's possible if they had not used the title ""Halloween III"" there would not be so much negative feedback. It's actually very spooky and fun. The music is chilling as in most John Carpenter films and the villian Conal Cochran as played by Dan O'Herlihy is very effective. I thought the Silver Shamrock zombies disguised as company executives in fancy suits had a very eerie, creepy feel to them. The story is simple which is always a plus. After her father mysteriously dies in a hospital clutching a Halloween mask in his hand, Ellie Grimbridge and Dr. Dan Challis (Stacey Nelkin, Tom Atkins) investigate the strange town where the Halloween masks are manufactured. What they find is something far more sinister than they could have imagined. When it comes to these horror films, the fans are quick to criticize the sequels. I thought the idea of switching tactics was smart on the producers part. Michael Myers can only go on so long before it becomes dull. If you take Halloween III Season of the Witch for what it is (a stand-alone film not to be compared to Halloween/Halloween II) you may be pleasantly surprised.

It's not of the same genre as the previous films, indulging in only one brief slasher scene, but its far out and mysterious premise is actually quite engaging for a time.  The plot, involving a conspiracy of robots and ancient druid wizardry, actually works decently for much of the film, almost like an unnecessarily long but intriguing Twilight Zone episode, only glued together with a healthy suspension of disbelief.  Heck, it even manages to explore the significance of Halloween in a way that nearly earns it a place in the franchise, but the ending falls apart badly.  As soon as we hit the climax, nothing makes sense anymore and, quite soon after, everything just gets plain silly.  Dr. 6-Pack's battle with the annihilated robot's severed limbs would have worked much better with Bruce Campbell playing the role.

But anyways, one of the mysterious men find the man in his room, and tears his eyes out with his two fingers. The mans daughter come in the next day, played by Stacey Nelkin. Challis & the daughter decide to travel to the silver shamrock factory to hopefully find out about the masks.

Once they arrive they meet a handful of suspects. Theres a homeless guy that lives behind the motel, some grumpy bitch, and a happy-go-lucky family, and of course Conal Cochran, head of the Silver Shamrock company.

But we are awaiting another death her, so the grumpy chick decides to take a closer look at the label on one of the Halloween masks. She starts poking it with a hairpin and a laser shoots out at her, melting her face off her head, to a pretty cool gore scene, then to stretch it, a cockroach crawls out of the bloody mess. As the ambulance takes her away Cochran calls it ""a missfire"". The bum gets his head pulled off by ""the agents"".

Challis & the daughter get a tour of the factory with the family. The family if a couple, with a son about 9 years old. They notice a door labeled ""Final Processing"". Cochran changes the subject, which Challis finds suspicious. So later, Challis breaks into the clinic, finding out that our ""agents"" are androids programmed by Cochran. Once Cochran finds him, he takes him into the final process room, showing him the daughter has been kidnapped, and then he shows him something else disturbing. The family is locked up in ""Test Room A"". Cochran plays the damn commercial, and power from the stolen Stonehenge rock causes the label on the back to fire, melting the little boys head, sending a swarm of insects and crawlies out of the boys pumpkin mask. The two parents are also then killed, and eaten alive by all the bugs, much to Chaliss' horror.

Eventually rescuing the daughter, they kill all the androids, and Cochran is melted with the power of stonehenge. So Challis needs to stop the commercials, saving all the children in America. The ride to a phone, Challis realizes that the daughter has been turned into an android by Cochran, so Challis pulls over, and after a long fight, slaughters the daughter.

When Challis gets to the gas station, he sees kids with the Shamrock masks watching the commercial on a TV, so he phones 3 TV stations, he stops the commercial on the first two channels, then he comes to the third channel, the commercial keeps playing, and playing, Challis is screaming to have it pulled off, but the film ends before we ever know what happened. Did he stop it or not? Thats just to our imaginations.

I love Halloween 3, the pure imagination and storyline is great. Its got a great soundtrack, director Tommy Lee Wallace does a great job, and the film in haunting as hell, I really think a sequel should be made to this, and not a damn remake.",1221091200,,3591,4.498466257668712

The first two Halloween movies were very good and I expected the same out of the next one when I bought it. To find out that it has nothing to do with the other movies, in fact, it shows the first Halloween movie on the television as an actual film and not something that would have happened, as a sequel should be. This is more like some cheesy, stupid, 80's sci-fi movie and should not even have the Halloween name. If you have this movie, you should burn it and if you don't, don't ever see it or even waste money on buying it (like I made the mistake of). It really sucks!",1220745600,,674,4.037313432835821
837614,3,630428845X,"This Dvd is a success, though a minimal one.

First and formost, the original (well what I remember anyway) poster or at least vhs art on the cover.  Not some poorly photoshoped from movie, or worse, unrelated image with a new tile over the ""art"".  This has the picture I've always thought of as the cover of Halloween 3.

Secondly, the movie.  Widescreen, which is a nessecity for me in any format anymore.  If there is a possiblity of widescreen over full, wide is the only screen for me.  So success.  The movie itself is satisfactory quality, and better than vhs.  Which is really all I need anyway.  Not a high def guy as of yet.

Thirdly, special features.  Forget it, there aren't any.  And to be specific, I don't qualify original trailer as a special feature.  To be special the features should be something of note, or pasing trivial intrest, and preferably loads of them.  But I don't NEED special features.  I want the Feature, as in the movie.  And if it's lucky enough to be widescreen, errata be damned.

So a very satisfactory dvd, with my 3 main points: Original (or fondly rememberd) cover art/poster art, Widesceen, and finally better than Vhs quality.  So success.

Perhaps eventually a disc will come out with loads of special features, like John Carpenter explaining his theory that this movie was the next in a thematic Halloween series, with each movie focusing on different aspects of the holiday.  Not a Michael fest every time.  Many people aren't aware of this and that knowledge alone may finally cause them to understand what was going on in this movie.

For what it's worth, if you have never seen it, it has nothing whatsoever to do with Michael.  If you have heard about it, or have seen it and always hated that it didn't have anything to do with Michael, think of this.  It is a very effective movie made by one of the great modern horror directors about an aspect of halloween not often delt with, at least at the time (irish origins, ect) and in an inventive way, with some good scary and memorable moments (six more days to halloween, halloween) that you cant soon forget.",1206403200,3,2110,4.592493297587131
837615,1,630428845X,"Oh my god, this is dumb. It was one of the last of the Halloween films I saw and the wait was truly not worth it. The story involves mysterious Halloween masks that have flooded the market and become the ""must have"" item for the nation's kids. Trouble is that there's something very seriously dangerous about them...and on the night of Halloween they are primed to...well watch it and see.

Or actually, I recommend that you don't bother doing that, as this is one of the poorest horror films I have ever seen. It really has very little going for it. The hero is a doctor who stumbles across a mysterious case of murder in his hospital. On the trail of the killer, he teams up with a younger woman who is also searching for answers, and together they discover a remote toy factory that is churning out Hallowen masks that have the power to kill the person that is wearing them. Well this is already a silly premise, made worse by the multitude of dumb things in the script...the behaviour (and explanation for it) of the vacant looking factory employees, the one-dimensional sub plot of the doctor's relationship with his ex-wife, and lots of very silly minor characters. The effect that the deadly masks actually have when they activate/detonate is laughable - what on earth made the writers think that this was frightening? Slugs and bugs and snakes are so-o-oo old hat in horror effects and there's very little logic in how they are used here. Dumbest highlight number one is the doctors capture and subsequent escape from a ""high security"" cell in the factory - which leads to even dumber highlight number two, which is the duo managing to infiltrate the factory control room via some hilariously unconvincing sneaking and hiding (at one point hiding behind and then trundling a noisy shelf of masks on wheels along while everybody in the room ignores it!!). The success of this mission when such a lot of screen time is devoted to showing us that the factory has hundreds of security cameras and invincible staff made me shake my head in disbelief. The film ends with a cliff hanger, but all that made me want to do is yawn.

Avoid this turkey if you like horror films. There are some moments when it approaches ""so-bad-it's good"" territory, but not enough of them, and things are only made worse by the terrible datedness of the factory's so-called high tech equipment. Showing big flat panels with nothing but coloured lights that turn on and off, and technicians who dramatically flick random switches up and down on a large panel does NOT make a convincing super-computer scene!!

837617,2,630428845X,"HALLOWEEN 3-THE SEASON OF THE WITCH is Science-Fiction thriller flick that Universal released in theaters on Friday October 22, 1982 and the only film in the HALLOWEEN saga where the story doesn't revolve around the hellbent ghoulish mass-murderer(Michael Myers).

The story focuses on an investigation by an alcoholic down-on-his-luck surgeon Dr. Daniel Challis(Tom Atkins)and Ellie Grimbridge(Stacey Nelkin)into the activities of evil Irish warlock & mysterious owner of the Silver Shamrock Novelties company Conal Cochran(Daniel O'Herlihy)in the week approaching Halloween night of 1982 after Ellie's father gets murdered.

Additionally, HALLOWEEN III-THE SEASON OF THE WITCH departs from the slasher film genre which the original John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN spawned in 1978, instead featuring a ""mad scientist"" theme.  Therefore, the frequency of graphic violence & gore is less than that in HALLOWEEN II, but HALLOWEEN III's death scenes still remain intense, despite the fact that Michael Myers was no where to be found.

HALLOWEEN 3 was produced on a $2.5 million budget and was death at the box-office since this sequel only grossed $14.4 million during its theatrical release in the Fall of 1982 as opposed to the original HALLOWEEN grossing $47 million at the box-office in the Fall of 1978, and HALLOWEEN 2 grossing $25.5 million at the box-office in the Fall of 1981, making HALLOWEEN 3 the poorest performing film in the HALLOWEEN saga at the time, which prompted producers to bring the Michael Myers character back when HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS was released in the Fall of 1988.

In addition to weak box-office returns, most critics gave this film negative reviews, because where HALLOWEEN had broken new ground & was imitated by many genre films following its wake, this 3rd installment seemed to hackeneyed to many where 1 critic suggested that if HALLOWEEN III was not part of the HALLOWEEN saga, then it would simply be ""a fairly non-descript 80's horror flick that was no worse & no better than many others.""

When John Carpenter(Director of the original HALLOWEEN)and producer Debra Hill were approached about creating a 3rd HALLOWEEN film, Carpenter & Hill were reluctant to pledge commitment to this sequel, because Carpenter and Hill agreed to participate in the new project only if HALLOWEEN 3 wasn't a direct sequel to its predecessors HALLOWEEN I and HALLOWEEN 2, which meant no Michael Myers, no Dr. Sam Loomis(Donald Pleasance), no Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis), and no Sheriff Lee Brackett(Charles Cyphers)since Carpenter apparently felt that the Michael Myers character was getting burned out & tired, especially after Michael & Dr. Loomis had supposedly died in the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital on Halloween night of 1978 at the end of HALLOWEEN II.

Therefore, Cochran played the villain in this movie instead of the relentless Michael Myers, Ellie Grimbridge was Laurie Strode's honored successor, and the movie took place in a fictional small town in Northern California called Santa Mira instead of the fictional Mid-Western town Haddonfield, Illinois, but in reality, most of HALLOWEEN 3's filming took place on location in the small coastal town of Loleta, California & a milk bottling plant in Loleta called Familiar Foods served as the Silver Shamrock Novelties factory in the movie, but all the special-effects involving fire, smoke, and the explosions were filmed at Universal Studios in Hollywood.

Additionally, HALLOWEEN 3's was also the directorial debut of Tommy Lee Wallace, although he wasn't a newcomer to the HALLOWEEN saga since Tommy Lee Wallace was the art director and production designer for the original HALLOWEEN in 1978 and declined to direct HALLOWEEN 2 in 1981.

Two members of the supporting cast for HALLOWEEN III such as Nancy Kyes whom played Dr. Challis' ex-wife(Linda)whom also co-starred in the original HALLOWEEN as Laurie's smart-aleck friend(Annie Brackett), stunt performer(Dick Warlock)who makes a cameo appearance as one of Cochran's android assasins had previously played Michael Myers in HALLOWEEN II, and Jamie Lee Curtis contributed her voice as the telephone operator when Dr. Challis tries unsuccessfully to make phone calls outside of Santa Mira, even though Jamie Lee Curtis didn't even appear in this movie.

When I saw the previews of HALLOWEEN 3: THE SEASON OF THE WITCH advertised on TV back in the Autumn of 1982 before it's theatrical release I was under the impression that it was supposed to be as spooky and as heart-pounding as the first 2 Halloweens, because when they had advertised HALLOWEEN III on TV back then, the narrator had said ""First came HALLOWEEN, then the terror continued with HALLOWEEN 2, now comes HALLOWEEN 3"", as if it were going to be even more shocking if not just as scary as its predecessors giving us no real clue that Michael Myers was nowhere to be found in this 3rd installment of the HALLOWEEN saga.

In addition, this HALLOWEEN III DVD didn't even have a movie trailer of the previews of HALLOWEEN 3 that were shown in the movie before it's theatrical release, unlike HALLOWEEN and HALLOWEEN 2 did, so I don't see why they forgot to add a movie trailer preview for HALLOWEEN III, because they should have, especially since the HALLOWEEN I DVD and HALLOWEEN II DVD did.

What else I couldn't help finding kind of interesting was HALLOWEEN 3 was quite the opposite of the original HALLOWEEN, since Halloween I's slogan was ""The Night He Came Home"" and HALLOWEEN 3's motto was ""The Night Nobody Comes Home"" and HALLOWEEN 2's motto was ""More Of The Night He Came Home"".

HALLOWEEN 3: SEASON OF THE WITCH also takes me back to memory lane to all the budget cuts we had going on back then, due to the recession we had back in 1981-82 when Ronald Reagan was president too and to the days when I was living in my hometown(El Centro, CA) since I was raised in the Imperial Valley throughout my whole childhood years.",1202428800,,5945,5.1101956745623065

There are some memorable scenes in H3, especially the ones involving those murderous robot-zombies! The Tv-as-deadly-weapon idea is a biting commentary on our own blind consumerism.

837671,5,630428845X,"The Film: Halloween III-Season Of The Witch
Year Made: 1982

The packaging: 3 Stars.  I loved the overall look of the outside packaging.  Inside, the disc is easy to pop out, yet stays nice and secure once placed back in the CD holder which is a huge plus.  No extras here though on the disc, not even the trailer for the film.  All you really get is the main feature film.  This is about as basic as you can get.  I got the impression that the company just wanted to just toss this on the market for sale, but did not really want to put any real effort into making this a all around top notch package.  This is a disappointment, considering just how great the film is itself.

Spook Meter:  2 Stars  This film is just amazing.  It's not your average horror film in that, it's not very scary at all but does have a certain edge too it that is very unique.  Your probably thinking, well why 5 stars overall then for the film..  What this movie does so well is it's just plain fun to watch.  It's suspenseful horror more then overall scary horror.  This is one of my favorite horror films because it just has a very unique feel to it.  The music with the pumpkins playing the song ""two more days till Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, two more days till Halloween, silver shamrock"" is very catchy and will put a smile on your face every time you hear it.  If you want to watch a great horror film that will not leave you awake for days at a time afterward.  If you want a really fun experience that will leave you singing the special tune that plays throughout the film, this IS the one to watch.  DO NOT do what so many reviewers always make the mistake of doing.  DO NOT watch this film and compare it to other Halloween movies.  Watch this and make your opinion about this on it's own merit and I'm sure you will LOVE this.  The masks are killer (pun intended) hahahhaa to look it.  The way everything was filmed is really cool, it just has a very cool feel throughout the whole movie.

Gore Meter:  3 Stars.  This is pretty mellow as far as gore.  There is a few scenes that will make some viewers cringe but overall their is very little gore involved. The few scenes that are more graphic, are done so in the more cheesy campy type tone that does not leave you thinking. ""umm did that person just die for real"" feeling, like some very graphic films can do so well at.  This one does for the most part what so many horror films tend to do and that is, a death scene is shown to a point, but then the camera pans away so you don't exactly see all that is happening.  It's left to your imagination on the details of what just happened for the most part.  I do give the gore meter a 3 star mark though because of the couple of scenes that are a bit graphic and will make some viewers wonder why nobody warned them.

Profanity Meter. 1 Strike. A few words, but this film is another reason why I love this so much.  Very little profanity involved here, so you can sit back and actually enjoy this film and not have to cringe at every time someone opens their mouth in this.  I find that even the most scary and most gory films, are so much more enjoyable when very little profanity is used.

Sexual Meter:  2 Strikes.  There is a makeout scene in this one, but it's not very graphic at all and won't offend most viewers.  There is a part where a viewers sees a guys ""moon"" shot for a moment when he gets out of bed. hmmm I could have done without that. laughs..

Final thoughts.  Seems that people either love this film or hate it.  I'm not the type of person who compares a film to another one. I review each and every one on it's own Merit as I have said.  With that said, this is a amazing and fun film to watch.  I watch this every year at Halloween and it has earned a permanent spot on my play list for great watching each year.

""Halloween"" creators John Carpenter and Debra Hill thought they had a good idea. Carpenter and Hill (returning as producers), along with writer/director Tommy Lee Wallace (who was the production designer and co-editor of the first film) conjured up a new story with new characters. So Michael Myers has absolutely nothing to do with this movie. ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" is about a plot to kill millions of children on Halloween night thanks to some new Halloween masks that has just come off the assembly line known as Silver Shamrock masks. A doctor and young woman (whose father was killed under mysterious circumstances) try to figure out who's behind it and eventually try to stop it before it's too late. This is a mostly forgettable film. Plus there are some truly disgusting moments of violence (the film goes too far in one scene where the lead character, after being captured by the bad guys, is shown via an example of what exactly will happen to children who own these masks). The only good things about this movie are Carpenter's music score which is quite chilling, and the performance by Dan O'Herlihy as the main villain. But I'd rather see Michael Myers as the villain instead, and most moviegoers who enjoyed the first two films of the series agreed with that theory. ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" was a critical and financial failure. So guess who made a triumphant return for ""Halloween 4""?",1193788800,,1570,4.840148698884758

He falls into a sadistic plot to punish all of the children who love Halloween and 'beg for candy.' The evil, but charming Conal Cochran, played by Dan O'Herily, almosts succeeds in his diabolical Halloween joke. The love interest,Ellie, played by the goregous Stacey Nelkin ( whose scenes in 'Blade Runner' were left on the cutting room floor by Ridley Scott-shame on you , Ridley!) falls for the Dr. and they try to unravel why her father was murdered. The clever Stonehenge twist and suspense keep the film going in a murderous pace. Of course, John Carpenter returned to produce and score all the music( which by itself is a masterful score) The original ideas he had, along with producer Debra Hill, were to leave Micheal Myers dead and buried and invent a brand new 'Halloween'. As a sequel, it doesn't work, but as a separate horror film from the masters who invented the modern scary movie, it scores big. As for the film's blood and gore, it's more like blood and insects...Lots of insects! If you're afraid of bugs at all, stay away from this film! Definately not for the squeamish.

837677,4,630428845X,"This is a reasonably intense film and a good entry in the Halloween series, even though it stands apart from the other films in the series. The plot concerns a doctor (Tom Atkins), who stumbles across a plot to suffer the wee children on Halloween. His quest to foil this plot leads him to the manufacturer of Halloween masks in a small town, which is controlled by the owner (the late Dan O'Herlihy of ""Robocop,"" ""Twin Peaks,"" etc.) of said company. Tagging along is the daughter (the beautiful Stacey Nelkin) of one of the victims, determined to figure out why her father was murdered. This film drew me in from the opening title sequence, which features compelling theme music by John Carpenter. The film has a decent story, is well-paced and has adequate shocks and violence along the way. It is neither post-modern art nor complete schlock; rather, it is intended purely as entertainment and it succeeds pretty well. A couple of facets of the film do bother me, however. For example, the affair between Dr. Challis and Miss Grimbridge is both unnecessary and improbable. These two are personally affected by this sinister plot, which threatens many more fatalities. Realistically, their minds would be focused on relentless pursuit of a way to stop it; yet, they take time out for a night of passion?! To stretch it even further, the good doctor smokes, drinks, is average-looking and appears to be approaching fifty (Tom Atkins was forty-seven at the time of the film's release). Why would a young hottie (Stacey Nelkin was twenty-three) want to put mourning for her father aside to play doctor with this man?! (Okay, so Miss Nelkin allegedly dated Woody Allen when she was a teenager and Mr. Allen was in his forties, inspiring his film ""Manhattan."" Personal preferences aside, I found it unrealistic in this film) Also, some of the effects during the film's climax are a bit obtuse, though this is not atypical for horror films with any appreciable budget. These qualms aside, I would personally rather have had the sequels go the way of the anthology than be a series of inferior re-hashing of the first film. Halloween is a wonderful time of the year and is capable of inspiring so many stories that could center on it. Yes, the first ""Halloween"" is phenomenal, but what is the purpose of repeating that story ad nauseam with only minor variations? John Carpenter is above that and so are discerning horror fans. I enjoy this film and appreciate the job Universal did with the DVD, which has a clean transfer, is widescreen and offers subtitles. Film: 3/5; DVD: 4/5.",1193184000,5,2576,4.817155756207675
837727,3,630428845X,"This movie represents a major departure from the theme of the two earlier ""Halloween"" films.  Gone is the menacing Michael Myers, who supposedly died at the end of part II.  He is replaced in this movie by another evil-doer, Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy), the CEO of the Silver Shamrock Company.  Cochran's company makes Halloween masks and other novelties, but his masks are quite different from any other.

The story begins with the death of Harry Grimbridge (Al Berry).  Harry owned his own toy story which carried Silver Shamrock masks.  He is discovered roaming the darkened countryside by a service station attendant, and Harry was muttering that everyone would be killed.  The attendant takes Harry to the hospital, where he is attended to by Dr. Dan Challis (Tom Atkins).  However, Harry is attacked and killed by a mysterious man, who then gets in his car and kills himself.  Meanwhile, Grimbridge's daughter Ellie (Stacey Nelkin) has also arrived and identifies her father's body.  They discover that Harry was clutching a Silver Shamrock mask when he was murdered.  Dan and Ellie decide to do some invesigation on their own.

The investigation leads the two to the town of Santa Mira; a factory town controlled by Silver Shamrock.  People stay inside their homes, curfew is 6 p.m., and everything seems out of sorts.  However, as Dan and Ellie delve deeper into the secrets of the town and of the Silver Shamrock corporation, they discover that the masks being produced contain a microchip which kills the person wearing the mask.  Now, Dan and Ellie must stop Cochran and his diabolical scheme to kill thousands of children who bought the masks.  Will Dan succeed in time? And, is Ellie really who she seems to be?

I found this movie difficult to follow after seeing the first two ""Halloween"" films.  I missed the character of Michael Myers, and I felt this movie just wasn't as scary to watch as the earlier ones were.  I heard that it was John Carpenter's idea to totally scratch Michael Myers and create a new and different ""Halloween"" movie each year with a totally different storyline and cast of characters, but this idea failed because this movie was poorly received.  Sadly, I agree; I didn't like this movie very much.

This movie is a little above average, but it is nowhere near as scary as the films with Michael Myers in them.  After this movie, the subsequent films saw the return of Michael Myers as the main character.  This movie has no bearing at all with Michael Myers, so viewers who miss this one will not miss out on the Michael Myers storyline, as he reappears in part 4.  This movie is a stand-alone from the others.  Don't watch this movie expecting to see Michael Myers; you'll be disappointed.",1190937600,2,2733,4.80085653104925

837729,1,630428845X,"INTRODUCTION: Let me start off this review by stating that I am a HUGE fan of Halloween 1, 2, 4, and 5- I think that they're all equally good. The very first in the series really started a series whose serial killer would be named ""one of the scariest serial killers ever"".

The other day, I was in the video store, and I came across all the Halloween films on DVD. I own The first Halloween, and the moment I saw the DVD copy of this I immediately snatched it from the shelf and rented it. I had heard LOTS of awful things about this and unfourtanately, those statements were right. It really is that bad. And I thought 8 was the worst.

STORY: The film starts off strongly... cool '80's-MAC-Computer-style opening credits, then we segue into a chase scene. Then after that, it's pretty much all downhill from there. This film's ""plot"" (if you must)is about an evil toymaker (NOT Michael Myers)who plans to blow up his halloween masks from people who bought it. The masks are rigged with explosives to turn kids' heads to snakes and cockroaches whenever the purchaser watches the stupid commercial.

THOUGHTS: Face it people, this is not a good film. Horrid acting, No Michael Myers, and not even Loomis (my FAVORITE character!) is included! The only redeeming quality is the soundtrack.

I noticed it in the movie Escape from New York. Decent film with a great setting. I always like how Halloween is filmed in a town that looks like something outside my door.

Carpenter didn't want to make ""The Shape"" an on going thing in sequel after sequel, so he decided to try a new story. I give him credit for trying as it is a very cool idea! Imagine a new Halloween movie coming out every couple of years with a completely new a different story.

To be truthful, I like the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm St. films, but they have become silly or almost a self parody over the years. Halloween started out as a great inventive horror movie. Only after Halloween III did they begin to follow the trend of churning out redundant sequels. The DVD transfer is very good for this movie and if your a fan of the series it should not be avoided because Michael doesn't come home ;-b",1174694400,3,793,4.358108108108108
837798,3,630428845X,"We all know what this movie is about...so my review is if you should own it or not.

I have been a fan of Halloween for as long back as I could remember. I've had every movie for years except this one. I was like most people that felt if Micheal Myers is not in it then it does not count. I would see it on TV and would never watch it.

 One day I was at the movie store and I saw it sitting there so I rented it and watched it and although it has nothing to do with the rest of the films it still has a feel to it that goes along with the time of the year it is. Which is Halloween (and my Bday!!)  So now I own it and its part of my collection and I actually kinda got a little satisfaction seeing it there.

Soooooo personally for me (and this is just my opionion) if you are a fan of Halloween you might as well own this movie. Because like it or not it IS part of the franchise. Its got the Carpenter feel to it and that Halloween jinle is catchy. Not to mention it looks nice when you line up your movies and theres actually a 3 between 2 and 4.

Now lets see how Rob Zombie does with the remake....",1173484800,2,1105,3.761904761904762

I love the Halloween Series (most of it, anyway) but this is crap. Pass on this one, kids!

Edit: This movie has nothing to do with John Carpenter or Michael Meyers! Isn't this helpful info?? This movie isn't good. Cult classic maybe, but it is no Evil Dead. Period.",1170288000,,740,4.2785714285714285
837800,4,630428845X,"The only film of the series of five that will not deal with the insane immortal criminal with his kitchen knife. Here Carpenter moves to another theme : some crazy Irishman is going to play a trick on the children of this world and then take over the whole world. The first task will be performed through the millions of Halloween masks he is producing and selling in the world, with television as the trigger to ignite the malevolence of these masks which will turn the kids into wasps and snakes and plainly kill them at the very neat hour of 2100 hours on the 31st of October. The second task will be achieved through the army of robotized mechanical human beings that will just rake over the world and destroy any resistance. We are in science-fiction this time and fear is definitely less important. It may terrorize the audience but with the menace of a mad scientist this time and again. But it does not horrifies the audience because this concept of taking over the world with robots is too gross to be really believable. Many films have done better along that line since then and even before then. The Time Machine and 1984 for the older generation and The Matrix or Cube for the newer generation. In other words it is rather disappointing though it is altogether kept going at the proper rhythm and the end is both predictable and fresh enough not to look too simplistic. But definitely too many allusions to and borrowings from too many films and other works of imagination to be attributed any imagination of its own.

837802,5,630428845X,"When talking about the Halloween series, you'll always get the schmuck who says, ""oh yeah, then there was that one that didn't even have Michael Myers in it.  That was stupid"".  Yup, I've heard it time and time again.  Most of the time this statement comes from someone who hasn't actually seen the film or is just a victim of the general consensus that says this is a terrible film coz it's not a legitimate sequel.  Sure there are people out there that honestly just don't like the film, and that's cool coz there isn't a single film that everyone agrees is good.  If they have reasons for not liking the film other than the lack of Myers, that's A-OK with me.  Here's a little backstory.  Halloween 3 was the first and only film in an experiment of John Carpenter's.  Carpenter went to great lengths to show the audience at the end of Halloween 2 that Myers is dead, terminated, gone forevermore.  Carpenter hated the idea of a second Myers film, but was pressured to write a second(with the help of alot of Budweiser according to Carpenter in a Halloween documentary).  He left the directing to someone else coz he felt he'd already made this film before(which he did).  After part 2, Carpenter decided to start an entire series of ""Halloween"" films, each with a different theme.  One would be made each year, and come out in theaters around Halloween.  If you ask me, that's a pretty cool idea.  Halloween 3 was the first film in this new direction.  Carpenter producing and Tommy Lee Wallace directing.  However, everybody bitched about it and the idea was dead in the water.  Carpenter was screwed and abandoned Halloween altogether, then Halloween producer, Akkad, saw dollar signs and brought Myers back with no more association with Carpenter.  So that's it.  This was a film that coulda been the start of a cool concept, but nooooooooooooooooo.  Michael's not even in it, damn it!  So, Halloween 3 is forever labelled as that rotten movie to avoid like the plague.  So, what about the movie itself?  Well, it's no masterpiece of modern cinema, but this movie deserves more attention than it gets.  It certainly deserves a cult following if it hasn't got one already.  It's actually quite bizarre.  It's got a helluva concept that actually uses the druid roots of halloween for it's villains' motives.  These points were briefly hinted at by Dr. Loomis in Halloween 2.  It revolves around the pagan aspects of the holiday.  In fact, while the first Halloween is a superior film to this one, this movie seems more suited to watch on Halloween than the first.  It's much much Halloweeny if you catch my drift.  There's some flat out crazy stuff in this movie.  Plus it has Tom Atkins which is worth two stars right off the bat.  You get orange blooded homicidal androids, an evil toymaking company that rules and terrorizes a town in Orwellian fashion, and some crazy friggin halloween masks.  Tell me that scene where they ""test run"" one of the evil masks on an unsuspecting family isn't totally demented and %#$!ed up!  That scene scared the hell out of me as a kid.  Who can forget the Silver Shamrock song? The band Helloween sample it on one of their songs so I know at least someone out there likes this film.  How bout that lady getting blasted in the mouth with the laser, and later has bugs crawling in her mouth?  Wacky!  And how about that ending?  That's one of the coolest endings I've seen in a horror film.  You certainly don't see endings like that in this day and age.  Everyone wants closure, everyone wants a nice ending.  Halloween 3 ain't got no nice ending.  But Michael Myers isn't even in it!!!  It's impossible to ignore this film's reputation, but if you dig horror films that are definitely out-there, try overcoming prejudice and check this movie out.  Then if you dig it, you can proudly flip off the rest of the world for tarnishing this movie's reputation and keeping you away from it for so many years.  The hell with Michael Myers I say.  And don't forget to watch the big giveaway at 9!!

P.S.
I had written this review a few years back when the movie was only available on a rather cruddy, bare bones DVD.  I thought this was the best we were ever going to see, but I am so happy and have to give mucho thanks to Shout Factory for releasing this in a Collector's Edition, and on Blu-Ray.  It's wonderful for director Tommy Lee Wallace, and others involved with the film, to finally have a voice and give their thoughts and stories on this film.  Up until now there has been so little information available about the making of this film(and way too much information about the other Halloween films), and now with a Making Of.. featurette and two commentaries, we finally get some insight.  I must say it was actually kind of moving to hear that Wallace was more or less devastated by the failure of this film, but in recent years has become aware of the increasing cult following.  Now he seems to feel it was all worth it in the end.  Very, very cool.  The Shout Factory edition is a godsend, and very highly recommended.",1161993600,242,5064,4.590401785714286

I would classify this film more as Sci-Fi and what a far-fetched (even by Sci-Fi standards) plot this was. Sloppy story-line that doesn't flow, horrible acting and the movie moves slow without much suspense. The only question you will ask is ""how much longer is this movie"" after the first 1/2 hour.

If you're reading this, you are probably aware that after ""Halloween II,"" John Carpenter felt that the Michael Myers story was played out. (You probably have heard the complaint that sequels are all just a repeat of part 1.) Well, this time they tried to give us something different. Their intent was to release a different type of Halloween every so often. We probably would have ended up with a number of interesting ""Goosebumps"" type movies. But too many of us just wanted the original story back. But on the other hand, it's not all our fault. The writers went about this the wrong way. By using the title ""Halloween,"" we naturally expected Mr. Myers. This interesting new idea would have worked better if they released this new series under a different name and indicated that it was from the MAKERS OF ""HALLOWEEN."" Moving on, this 3rd chapter is far from the worst. (That 'honor' belongs to the utterly stupid farce ""Resurrection."") Onto the subject at hand. This 3rd chapter opens up with a man running from some people who have unusual strength. (DATE OCTOBER 23rd.) He narrowly escapes and is admitted to a local hospital. Soon afterwards, we meet Dr. Challis. He is divorced, and we can infer the cause was drinking, working odd hours, being too social with other women, or perhaps all three. (This is alright. It gives our hero some faults and makes him more plausible.) We also see the Silver Shamrock Mask commercial which sets the mood and seems harmless enough. Later Dr. Challis goes to the hospital to treat the man we met earlier. Before he is brutally murdered, he warns everyone: ""They're coming to get us."" Moving on, Dr. Challis has his friend Teddy investigate the remains of the suicide (who killed the old man). In her minor part, Teddy is effective as she gradually reveals that whoever killed Ellie's father wasn't human. Later Dr. Challis meets Ellie who was the old man's daughter and naturally wants to find out as much as she can about her father's death. The chase takes Ellie and Challis to the Irish town Santa Mira. The town seems nice enough. It was built by a Mr. Cochran, but along the way, we hear that Cochran has done some not so nice things. We also meet Buddy Kupfer and his family who are a strange but nice. The Silver Shamrock Mask commercial begins to repeat, and we may find ourselves annoyed by it; but then it starts to have a chilling effect as it is repeated. The days until Halloween start disappearing faster and faster, and somehow we get the impression that something is going to happen Halloween. Cochran seems nice enough when we meet him, but we soon realize he is really sick (to say the least). But of course, sick or crazy does not equal stupid. Ellie gets abducted, and Cochran explains to Challis how Halloween is a lot more than getting dressed up and trick or treating. When we learn that Cochran intends to destroy A LOT of people with his tv commercial, the scenes showing different parts of the country with children running home to watch it are quite effective. Dr. Challis manages to escape Cochran, but can he stop the commercial in time? Rather than knocking this 3rd chapter because there is no Michael Myers in it, we should really give it a chance. (You can always go back to watching the Michael Myers chapters if you don't like chapter 3.) If seeing this movie makes you wish for what may have been, I suggest you look at the ""Goosebumps"" series.

This movie is an odd gem that should be seen. The only problem I have with it (hence the 4-star rating) is the sex and nudity. There was a particularly graphic sex scene, so anyone who is offended by that sort of thing shouldn't watch this. There is only one scene, and it's not particularly important to the movie. It was completely unneccisary, and it could have been rated R without it. There was some cheesy gore, and it's all pretty over the top. It's not really bloody, but it is kind of graphic. For example: a man stick his thumb and forefinger into a man's eyes, all the way to his skull. I know this sounds grotesque, but it's so cheesy, that I didn't get queesy.

  Overall, I think the plot was great. It was highly original and entertaining. There has never been anything like it, and there never will be. The ""Silver Shamrock"" song will stick in your head for days, as it is played about every five minutes (no joke). For people with anxiety, I do not recommend this movie. The soundtrack is repetitive in an eerie sort of way. You don't really get bored of it, because it simulates the monotonous feelings you get in your nightmares. In fact, the music is one of the best parts about this movie. I really liked this movie. I can't understand why it's so under-rated.",1149897600,15,1455,4.4216417910447765
837879,3,630428845X,"I see so many juvenile and silly reviews that consist of lines such as ""this film is stupid it doesnt even have michael myers in it!"" and ""they were just trying to make money of the name!"".  A word for you reviewers:  Grow up.  Do your research FIRST before you jump in and post whatever nonsense you can think of.  You are nothing but spoiled kids that have parents that are too out of touch to monitor your actions.  You deserve a smack in the mouth.  Anyways, this is an OKAY film.  John carpenter wanted to have a new halloween film every couple of years or so featuring DIFFERENT STORIES with different directors and writers putting in their own ideas into the mix.  It's called being a creative force and is something that is completely lost in todays hollywood.  A series of films bearing the ""halloween"" moniker would have been cool except they got off on the WRONG foot.  H3 is over the top and strange.  They just wanted to produce a horror film and have it similar to the ""creepshow"" concept of alternate universes and stories, etc.  Michael Myers was a boogie man that existed in this alternate reality of haddonfield, IL and was  a slasher and murderer.  Carpenter just wanted to switch gears away from that character and keep the universe going while presenting different tales. That's it.  H3 was supposed to be unrealistic and borderline cartoonish.  The acting leaves alot to be desired and the FX are almost comedic.  It was supposed to be a chapter of a long running serial of films.  The cinematography is spooky and I can see how carpenter was involved.  The film is weak but over time we could have had a new halloween film every couple of years from different directors breathing life into their nightmares.  When the movie failed at the box office the powers that be wanted more of myers and forced carpenter out of the franchise by seizing control of the myers character.  Carpenter, who is a hippie by nature, didn't have anything to do with it and simply walked away.  Who cares about selling out, right?  Right.  Carpenter did the RIGHT thing, people.  H3 was going to be the beginning however the studio squashed it and now we have numerous horrible sequels of myers just walking around offing people in different ways.  He's no longer scary and is just a cliche in the world of horror.  Too bad.  So now instead of getting your facts straight you sit there and spill out one line of stupidity and give this 1 star because you don't get it.  Good luck with your moronic remakes of the same garbage over and over again.  It's a shame amazon won't take a credit card number to verify your age and instead has a promise that you are ""over the age of 13"" before you hit that submit button.  I guess this is the right of the people to say whatever they want.  Ahh, the price of freedom.

To anyone that reads this....check out halloween 3, okay?  Don't buy it untill you see it first.  It may not be your cup of joe which is fine.  At least see it for yourself.  It's an odd little film with a lofty and sinister concept that will make you wonder how it ever made it to the big screen (children are the targets of a pagan world wide conspiracy using ancient magic to murder them....far out) in the first place.  You may either hate it or like it.  Some parts will make you laugh at the (intentional?) humor and some parts will make you squirm.  I for one think it's goofy by nature but fascinating to watch.

  for the first try he gave us this little tale of supernatural terror as a ""worlock"" who is planing to teach the world what halloween really means. dan o'herlihy(driping evil at every smile) steales the movie as the ""warlock"" toy maker about to play the greatest joke ever on the children of the world. this also features one of the best (and most bothersome  you will ever see or hear)ads that plays a nasty ""head game""(you must see the movie to understand) and the f/x's are aimed at gross out and they work.

837945,3,630428845X,"Directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, this critically maligned but sometimes effective thriller took a different route with the Halloween tale. It deals with a sinister plot to murder millions of children on Halloween night. Horror film actor Tom Atkins stars as Dan Challis, a doctor who stumbles upon the heinous plot while investigating the violent death of a toyshop owner. The murdered mans daughter, Ellie Grimbridge (Stacy Nelkin) teams up with Challis but time is not on their side since by day's end, on Halloween night, millions of children will put on their ""Silver Shamrock"" Halloween masks, turn on their television sets and if all goes as planned, will suffer the worst fate imaginable.

Objectively speaking, ""Halloween III"" is not as bad as its reputation leads you to believe. It's not on the same level as the highly praised original (or even ""Halloween II"" for that matter) but as a horror film, it delivers: violence, some gore, sex, some stiff acting while the characters are constantly being thrown in a bunch of weird, surreal situations. The story itself is pretty despicable. I mean, how many horror movies can you name where the victims are not sinful, bed-hopping, weed-smoking, loud-mouthed teenagers or adults but innocent, playful, unsuspecting children? How many horror films have you seen that display millions of creepy-crawlers and poisonous snakes explode out of a child's head? Death doesn't discriminate and this film makes that abundantly clear.

""Halloween III"" is in a class all its own in the series. There is no heavy breathing, masked killer waiting in the bushes holding a knife spying on and tormenting young baby-sitters; instead we are given several, stone-faced killers, a nefarious plot and one great horror film villain, Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy) who gives us some grisly insight behind his diabolical motivations. Those who are fans of Laurie Strode, Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis may dislike this film as it bears no relation to any of the previous and later installments (although, if you look closely, Myer's does make a very brief appearance). However, those who view this with an open mind and let themselves get taken in by its sinister plot of mass-murder and ritualistic sacrifice might just enjoy it. After all, it's crude, gory and violent. Aren't these the reasons you committed 90 minutes of your life to view this?

Not the best in the series but as a blood-soaked chriller, it delivers the goods.",1143590400,3,2457,5.061728395061729

Despite it's lack of intensity (and it really does pale in comparison to it's predecessors: Halloween & Halloween II) this film does manage to captivate the viewer in a different way.

  Before I even bought this film I knew (from word of mouth) that the infamous, fictional serial killer, Michael Myers wasn't even in this film, but I bought it anyway.  After viewing the film in it's entirety I wasn't disappointed.  The storyline (although a little cheesy) managed to keep me interested, and the actors do a pretty good job as well (considering what they had to work with).  This film wasn't as bad as all the negative hype surrounding it.

I think of it as some sort of bizarre macabre social commentary and believe it has only become more relevant with the passage of time. It is a worthy indictment of the ""TV generation"", actually ""generations"" now.

The plot is surprisingly twisted and comments on television and the way children are manipulated by corporations.

This year, a red-hot fad of masks put out by the 'Silver Shamrock' company is gripping the imagination of youngsters everywhere.  But there's something wrong with Silver Shamrock, and there is most definately something very, Very wrong with the masks.

  The first and only of the ""Halloween"" line not to feature legendary boogeyman Michael Myers, the ""Season Of The Witch"" is only connected to the rest of the series by name and, very vaguely, by theme.  Its reputation suffered greatly for its abscence of Michael, who fans understandably wanted to see, but I think if this had been released under a different, non ""Halloween"" title it would have been far better received, because this is a dark, freaky, disturbing, original and brilliant movie by itself.  The horrifying revelations awaiting the people who discover the secrets of Silver Shamrock equal the imposing specter of the unkillable Michael Myers in a one-of-a-kind movie that, ironically enough, set itself up to suffer from its originality by trying to be part of a great series that it really doesn't fit with.  Scary, sexy, highly bizarre, and possessed of one of the best and most distinctive musical scores John Carpenter ever composed, Halloween III shouldn't be missed just because it's different.

Since other reviewers have already detailed the synopsis and the plot, I'll just add my two cents.  This film really does get a bad rap that it truly doesn't deserve.  As others have pointed out, had it not been for the first name in its title, I don't think that it would have been criticized or denounced so harshly.  And let's face it, none of the sequels that followed under the Halloween name aren't exactly Academy Award winners either.  4,5,6,H2O - if you've seen one of them, you've seen them all, standard slasher formula.  That's why Carpenter and Lewis didn't have anything to do with those productions.  They just collect their respective royalty checks.

Although the plot isn't totally original (steals some from Invasion of the Body Snatchers), the story line is fairly decent - a pagan who wishes to restore Halloween to its ancient Celtic origins.  This film actually incorporates some of the historical facts regarding the old world Irish holiday Samhein.

Of course there are plot holes here and there.  Transporting a monolith from England to California and presuming that some sort of technological signal in a TV set could activated a particle of that stone is a little far-fetched.  But hey, the ancient Celts were renouned for their sorcery, mysticism, and magic.  Anyways, it's fiction!

As for the acting, I can't say much for the two leads, Atkins and Nelkin, but Dan O'Herlihy is excellent as Conal Cochran.  He isn't like most horror genre villans that you run from while screaming hysterically and flailing your arms, No! This is the killer who comes to you as an otherwise intelligent, civilized and empathetic man, with a smile on his face hiding a diabolical plan - not the standard characterization of a silent psychopath who just escaped from a mental hospital.  You actually get to know O'Herlihy's character and motives.

Fans of electronic synthesizers (ah, the '80s!) will enjoy the soundtrack, though I must admit that the Silver Shamrock commercial does get a little annoying.  Burman's special FXs are pretty standard for his style, which means mostly icky and not a lot of gore, but this film isn't for gorehounds or those who are overly obsessed with the slasher genre and judging by some of the previous reviews, there are still a lot out there.

The DVD is no-frills. Same running time as the VHS so don't expect any extras.  Now that the Halloween series appears to be dying (Moustapha Akkad, who was the executive producer of this film and all of the other Halloween films was recently killed in a Jordanian terrorist bombing), I hope fans will go back and take another look at the originality and creepiness of the plot in Halloween III, like Carpenter had hoped that they would have in 1982.",1132272000,8,2856,4.837448559670782

The scale of the evil in this movie makes teen slasher movies look pretty tame in comparison.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes horror.",1122940800,11,617,4.513513513513513

No Michael Myers. Keep that in mind b4 forking out the dough for it. Halloween III is an attempt for movie makers to do something else other than your typical slasher flick. Point of interest though, although III was not directed by John Carpenter, (the director of part 1 and producer of II), John was involved in III as a producer and did the eerie music, so that gave me enough reason to give it a chance.

I personally watched this when it came out in 1983, and you know what? I liked it. Don't laugh in hysterics here, but this movie is about a company that sells cursed masks to the kids to kill them on Halloween and it's up to one man (Tom Atkins) to stop this horrible day!  Certainly a morbid idea and silly to boot, but the outcome is not as demented as it sounds and the final product is almost funny at times.  The movie concerns a company that makes these masks, evil masks mind you. With the cursed power of the rocks that were stolen from ""stonehenge"" they put a trace of the rock within the label of the mask, and when children where them, it kills them on Halloween. For all the concerned people out there, only one child ""at least known of is shown being"" well, killed by the mask. It's up to the infamous ""Tom Atkins"" to stop this evil occurance from happening. The President of the company responds to the question...""Why"". He said, It's a joke on the children."" The movie is saved by a good sense of ""morbidness"" as the final act is finally reached. Tom Atkins didn't win any oscars, but he's you're average ""Joe"" caught up in the middle of the craziness.

Thanks to some good acting by a bunch of nobodies, tight pacing, and one humorous, but disgusting scene with snakes and bugs crawling out of some heads, it's not as bad as one might think.  Keep an open mind for Halloween III, and forget about Michael Myers. John Carpenter wanted to do something different, he was obviously smart enough to know that the ""Michael Myers"" storyline was maxed out after 2 and it was time for a change. Now, the big question, why was this movie called Halloween III: Season of the Witch. We may never know!",1120176000,3,2140,4.405063291139241

The concept of an evil novelty inventor, along with a legion of mechanical henchmen, out to instill fear into the night of Samhain.  The fact that he made mechanical people, like he would mechanical toys, to help destroy the lives of children seems a bit more twisted than another kniving.  And he succeeded, which wins points.

838147,2,630428845X,"In 1982, director, Tommy Lee Wallace, with the help of original HALLOWEEN producers, John Carpenter (director of the original Halloween) and Debra Hill, had directed the film, HALLOWEEN III: SEASON OF THE WITCH.

  On October 23rd, a crazed man is brought into the hospital of shock, where he tells the nurse of this crazy story about people trying to kill him. DR. DAN CHASLIS (played by TOM ATKINS) comes in after visiting his two kids and ex-wife. The man is admitted into the hospital, but someone dressed in black comes in and kills the crazed man, where the man is turned into a mysterious ash.

  Dan finds that the man was holding a mask that was the face of a Jack O'Lantern, made by Silver Shamrock Companies. With the man's daughter, ELLIE (played by Stacey Nelkin), on October 29th, they travel to Santa Mira, CA, to visit the Silver Shamrock factory. The factory creates three choices of Halloween Masks: Jack O'Lanterns, Skulls, and Witches. Every kid across America has a mask of their own. They find that the owner and runner of the company, CONAL COCHRAN (played by Dan O'Herlihy) is planning to kill every kid in America with these masks. He captures Dan and Ellie. Halloween has arrived, and Dan has escaped and rescued Ellie. They escape and kill Cochran and each one of his men, who were robots, and flee back home. On the way, Ellie goes ""robotic"" on Dan, leading him into destroying her.

  He returns to the garage, where Ellie's father had been first seen. The guy there has the T.V. on. The Silver Shamrock company had made a commercial with their masks, which counts down the days till Halloween. On Halloween night, the commercial tells the kids to put on their masks, where the kids die. Well, two or three kids walk in to get candy and they see the commercial. Dan has the television company on the phone, requesting that they take the commercial off the channel. The kids switch to the second channel, where the commerical is still showing. The commerical is swiped. The third channel has it, but it remains on the screen, with Dan screaming into the phone, ""...TAKE IT OFF! TAKE IT OFF!...""

  All right, where the hell is Michael Myers?! The film was not THAT bad, but it was bad in the sense that a HALLOWEEN movie was made without a trace of the film's brutal mass murderer.

However, notwithstanding this fact, this is still a pretty crappy movie. The plot is anything but believable, even for a horror fantasy. The idea of the killer masks is less than inspired, and the whole story would be best told in an hour-long episode of the Outer Limits or something. It's too watered down for a full-length picture. The only reason to see this movie at all is for the scene with the kid's head being turned into a pile of creepy crawlers, and the woman who died similarly after her mask tampering got her a ""laser beam"" in the face, reducing her mouth to a gory hole (complete with the bug crawling out). Once you've cued up to these parts and watched them, this movie really has nothing more to offer.

838154,5,630428845X,"This is in my opinion one of the most terrifying films I have ever seen, the whole premise of this film is enough to frighten hell the out of anybody. The story for the film was written by Nigel ""Quatermass"" Kneale, and British highly acclaimed science fiction/horror writer. Nigel ""Quartermass"" Kneale was so overwhelmed and disgusted by the gruesomeness(blood and gore) of this picture, so he sued the producers of this film to have his name removed from the credits. The film has a deeper meaning to it. Many Americans don't realize the hedonism of Halloween or their not concerned with it. Thousands of young children in North America go trick or treating every year on Halloween, yet they don't realize what their celebrating. The film involves a Celtic warlock disguised as a CEO of large company called Silver Shamrock, who is getting ready for a Halloween like no other. Meanwhile somewhere in the rural outskirts of Northern California an old man is getting chased by a group of assilants in charcoal colored business-suits. The assilants appear to have to have no remorse, and no feelings as well. He gets wounded by the assilants in an industrial parking lot. And ends up the hospital, he is treated at the local hospital by Dr. Challis, Mr. Grimbridge tries to warn everyone about the masks by saying their going to kill us all. Dr. Challis thinks that Mr. Grimbridge is hallucinating so decides that he should be put on some drugs to calm him down. Eventually he calms down but at night time one of the assilants steathly comes into the hospital and goes to Mr. Grimbridge' room, he cuts off his life support and then he squeezes his head until his brains burst. Mr. Grimbridge dies and he walks out of the hospital and gets in his car, the car explodes. Dr. Challis doesn't understand why the mysterious man killed himself, and wants figure out why he murdered Grimbridge so he teams up with his Grimbridge' daughter to try solve this mystery.

Their search leads them to a company town called Santa Mira in Northern California, where Silver Shamrock Novelties is located, what they eventually discover is terrifying. A man named Conal Cochran is selling Silver Shamrock masks to millions of young american boys and girls. What the children and their parents don't realize is what's inside the logo of the mask. Their is a piece of stonehedge fragment hidden inside the back logo of every single mask. When the silver shamrock commercial is aired on Halloween night, the stonehedge inside the mask will be activated and melt the viewer's head who is wearing the mask. Dr Challis discovers that Cochran is interested in taking the world back to ancient Druid times when human sacrifices were made and as he says, ""the hills ran red with the blood of animals and children"". Indeed, this is what Cochran wants and to achieve this goal, Cochran uses witchcraft and an ancient power to achieve his evil goal. A trick on the children is what Cochran wants, but this is no ordinary trick...this trick will kill millions and set the world back thousands of years into a time of evil and treachery, all of this which is supposed to happen on Halloween night of course.

How the hell did this even get a Halloween name attached to it?  Actually scratch that i don't even wanna know at all.  I know it seems to be the case in loads of horror movies.  But what the freak is the deal with having to have a shower scene?  It isn't really necessary if the actor/actress wanna sleep together just get it over with.  Speaking of it didn't take dude long in this movie to get with a woman he had met maybe a day or so before.

The villian in this one already had issues prior to you even seeing him.  With the stupid and corny commercial that aired with a skull and a couple other type masks.  Is it just me or did people really not care about stuff like that at all.  There is one death scene in particular where someone gets something important removed from their body.  If you watch it you'll know exactly what i'm talking about.  Not a bad death scene but just a tad bit cheesy at the same time.

Again i won't spoil the movie for those that still wanna see it.  But if you do at the very least get someone else to pay for the movie for you.

I too have my ""pet"" horror favorites that everyone else on the planet thinks are complete crap and have tasted the ridicule that comes with defending them. Having said that, here is my honest 2 cents on this film.

I am old enough to remember when it came out, and the horror it caused. Not because it is scary, but because the audience felt gipped over the absence of Michael Meyers, and rightfully so. Using the name bordered on fraud, but having read the other reviews here I can see the producers were actually trying to do something different. Kudos to them. But it didn't work.

The first half of this film ain't bad. I had seen bits and pieces over the years, but not until this year during a horror-fest on TV did I finally (after 22 years) see the whole shebang. I was so intrigued by the first hour I taped the second half when I had to leave the house, so I could catch the rest when I returned. Now I wish I hadn't.

This movie is terrible. I mean horrendously bad. The concept is kind of intriguing until we get the ridiculous wooden-nickel payoff (Stonehenge? What? Huh?). The craven attempt to get the trademark Halloween piano soundtrack in by showing the movie on TV in the background is less funny than pathetic. The script is garbage and the acting is not good enough to make up for it. The female lead climbing into bed with the doctor before her father is even cold is unseemly. And the scene where her clone-robot keeps attacking him again and again despite losing limbs had me screaming with laughter. If she'd said, ""The Black Knight always triumphs!"" and tried to bite his kneecap it couldn't have been funnier. And the ending is awful. Am I supposed to believe a raving man making an anonymous phone call could convince 2 of 3 networks to pull the ads of a huge corporation at the very last moment, based on his insistence that the commercial was evil? Hell, if that worked, I'd try it every time that damn Nextel commercial came on.

I'm no big fan of Mr. Meyers movies overall, but even that mouth-breathing nut job deserved better than to have his name attached to this ka-ka. Anyone who pays money for this DVD needs to be sharing a cell next to him in the nut house. Don't worry, though. You'll have no trouble escaping.",1100476800,6,2421,4.45823927765237

I remember watching this movie when I was about fourteen years old..I had rented it along with the other Halloween movies to have a night of scares (I hadn't ever seen Halloween 4, 5 or 6 by that time). I popped this movie in and was stunned at the stupidity of the plot and the terrible acting. First off, you can't create a movie that belongs in a franchise and add a plotline that has NOTHING to do with the original two. The plot basically revolves around a woman investigating the mysterious death of her father, who was killed by a strange man in a suit who commited suicide in his car promptly after murdering the man. Anyways, She ventures to this small town in California that is prominantly Irish that is well known for it's Silver Shamrock Halloween masks. Mayhem ensues and the woman, along with the doctor who tried saving her father, embark on a pointless and uninteresting quest to find out what is so eerie about the mask making town. The viewer soon learns that the founder of the mask making company has an evil plot that involves robot servants and a somewhat disturbing Halloween doomsday type scheme. The only HALFWAY scary things about this movie (aside from the bad acting, and unnaturally creepy shot of Tom Atkins ass) is the brooding, eno-ish score provided by John Carpenter and the slightly disturbing death scene of a young (Although bratty) boy in front of his parents. I can't believe this movie was actually made. It's shockingly bad...The badness of the movie is even made worse by a negative ""WE'LL NEVER REALLY KNOW"" type plot ending. This movie is just a terrible mistake in a succesful slasher series. They should have actually went back and created a REAL Halloween 3 after this pathetic flop. It's a shame that it belongs in a series that includes the infamous Michael Myers. I wouldn't even give this movie 1 star, but I like John Carpenter and I am a sucker for 80's horror...There will always be something so much more terrifying about horror movies from the 80's than ones made now. This movie is bad though. If it's on tv and you have the time, watch it...but, PLEASE don't waste your money buying this garbage!!!!",1099526400,7,2204,4.6106870229007635

Tom Atkins is terrific as usual and don't forget about Carpenter and Howarth's excellent score. The dvd is beautiful, the picture clear and finally 16x9 enhanced! Next time though how about some bonus features. Go back and  re-discover a great film, it's way better than any of the sequels that followed it.",1099353600,8,470,4.662650602409639
838339,1,630428845X,"There are two issues to cover regarding this movie:

1: Changing the storyline.  In part 3 of the series we find the story is no longer involving the main character Myers.  For some odd and not altogether sane reason they removed Myers and made the story about a toy company gone bad.  The whole concept is not just cheesy; its sad. People watch this francise for the same reason they watch Freddie and Jason (Yeah, see that, you know 'em by first name! Point proven), they want to see a killing machine in action causing a jolt here and there.  It isn't about the concept being deep and inventive.  The point is the opposite, these movies are mindless fun.

2: The new story. I cannot recall one moment in the film where there was anything interesting or scary going on. The whole concept of a mask manuafacturer killing the kiddies is almost bad enough to make me think they wanted to lose money for the tax break. I would suggest that this movie easily could have been released and stood on its own merits with some people out there, though not me.  The wise thing would to have released it by its own name, and not tied it to a series it has nothing in common with. Dont expect to be scared or to be wowed.  Expect to be stunned by their attempt to destro a francise.

In the end you have to realize that this movie may be called Halloween III, but it really has not earned that name in any form.  For practical purposes it would be best to just call it Season of the Witch.  Then it wouldn't drag this series' name through the mud.",1099180800,4,1536,4.295138888888889
838340,1,630428845X,"I know that statement is fairly intense. There have been lots of bad horror movies over the years. One often thinks of Leprechaun for example. But this is a thousand times worse. A THOUSAND!

In this movie we follow Tom Atkins's doctor character trying to figure out the secret of the Silver Shamrock toy company. They are producing Halloween masks with some evil property in them which causes people's heads to basically collapse in on themselves and release bugs into the room. Weird. Not really. That part is actually one of the better scenes of the movie. But the rest is pretty bad. Of all the horror franchises that have sprung up over the years, Halloween is my favorite. the first was amazing, and is the inspiration for the other famous slashers. The sequals are all resonably well done, considering the sequals to movies like Friday the Thirteenth or Nightmare on Elm Street. But Season of the Witch is the worst of all the Halloween sequals. For one thing, it isn't involved in the plot of the other movies about Michael Myers (though he does appear in the movie. Take a good look whenever someone is watching TV, the original Halloween is playing.) While the lack of The Shape is a downside to the film, it doesn't ruin it. I'm sure that is this movie had been done well it wouldn't have mattered. Carpenter is a great horror director, but he just went wrong in this movie. The first two Halloween movies were bloody and violent, but not like this gorefest. The movie lost the subtle creepyness that the original invoked, while later sequals tried to build the original movie's plot. This does not.

So in conclusion, I really hated Halloween 3. Fans of the series will watch it anyway (I did) out of curiosity, and the pure novelty of what happens when a good series tries to deviate from what people like about the original. However I will say this: I enjoyed the Twilight Zone like twist ending.",1099180800,4,1910,4.631268436578171

They go to a small town way out in the country where Silver Shamrock Halloween masks are made and uncover a crazy plot to...well, I'll leave that for you to discover.

The fun thing about this movie is that the plot is just so ridiculous, yet it somehow seems to work.  The acting is overall very good, and the plot moves along well.  It has a marvelous '80s atmosphere to it - so many movies from the early '80s still have a '70s atmosphere to them, but not this one.

838344,4,630428845X,"Halloween III - Season of the Witch is the best of the series. I've seen all of these films and this is the one that I can't shake. There is just an undercurrent of pure evil in this film that will scare the holy hell out of you. Sure, the idea is hokey and the acting second rate, but man those scenes where the ""test"" family puts on the halloween masks and has to watch the Silver Shamrock flashing pumpkin are just horrifying. Maybe it's because I was like ten years old when this first came out, but this movie still gives me the creeps more than 20 years later. The gore and blood shed is still here eventhough Michael Myers is not. Bottom line: Halloween III is undoubtedly the most original film of the Halloween series with legendary director John Carpenter at the helm, and one of the best endings of any horror film I've ever seen. This film embodies the spirit of the series and also takes it one step further...some of these scenes will stay with you for years to come.

838446,3,630428845X,"Alright so the characters may be hokey and the plot, a bit cheesy, but how can you diss the wonderful duo that is Debra Hill & John Carpenter?! Sure it may not have Michael Myers, but look at some of the horrible sequals that have turned out that DO include the shape. The 5th and 8th installments both reek of horrible performances, such as the two jokester cops (with absolutely cheesy cartoon sounds from time to time after the 2 are shown) & when Jamie is crying out to Dr. Loomis about a Cookie woman ad in 5! In 8 it's, Busta doing lame ass kung fu crap moves on Mike in Resurrection...How Embarrassing!!!  Resurrection overall, reminded me of an episode of Tales From the Crypt when a rotten guy is doing a reality show within a haunted house...and this was several years before this tragedy was released and much better I might add. However, I still included both of these in my own collection, as I love Dr. Loomis (in 5) and Michael is just bad ass no matter what he's in.

H3: Season of the Witch has it's moments, both good & bad, and the music is wonderful throughout. The ending is great too and is one that is annoying cause you are left on the edge of your seat...even though you know it will end the same every single time.  Even though I do appreciate and like this film very much, I only gave this edition 3 stars, as the bonus features are....well there's absolutely zippo...nada.  I'd love to see an interview or something show up on a future version as this is a severely underrated film just because there is no Mikey to watch stalk around. Mr. Carpenter had a good idea to switch up the Halloween pattern and take on a new story, which is why I am very pleased to have this dvd as part of my HalloweeN collection. Happy, Happy Halloween!

838447,1,630428845X,"The only reason this poor-quality horror flick is in the ""Halloween"" series is because of its title. It isn't even scary, just repulsive, with its victims being small children. Avoid at all costs. Putting this on DVD is a waste of bytes",1093478400,2,236,4.642857142857143
838448,2,630428845X,"I agree with everyone else that although the lack of Michael Meyers was insulting the first time I saw this movie, provided that the movie is still scary it's tolerable.  After seeing the documentary on the Halloween 25th Anniversary disc it was clear that John Carpenter did not want this to be a series and therefore was trying different things as he had no idea where to go with the series.  This was his attempt at making the Halloween series not about Michael Meyers, but instead about scary stories and Michael being only one of these stories.  I can swallow all that, but why in the world did we get this load of trash as a follow up?

It's Halloween time and that means that it's time to get a costume.  The Silver Shamrock company not only has a killer ad campeign (along with a wonderfully annoying song), but they also have a wide selection of high quality masks to choose from.  There's a catch though, once you view the special commercial that is due to air on Halloween evening your head turns to bugs and you die.  Now it's up to a few people to try to stop this chaos before it rains on the entire country, for if that message plays on Halloween night, a significant population will fall dead!

Okay, there are about four hundred reasons why this movie is garbage and about three reasons why it's good.  I'll be fair and even the stakes a little.  First, here's why it was good.  The storyline does hold water and flows quite well, and there are a few scenes (like the pumpkin mask scene) where you get truly creeped out.  Although John Carpenter didn't write it Tommy Lee Wallace does give decent writing, the concept of the movie when you look at it on a grand scale will leave you fearing the possibility that it could actually happen (which is what this series was founded on).  It also has a decent star-studded cast that makes the acting in the movie much better than most horror films and definitely realistic.  The problem with the film is that it isn't a slasher film, which is fine provided that you haven't already set that expectation, however since it has been set this movie disappoints those that will see it first and expect to see it most.  Although Michael Meyers isn't in it, if he was replaced by a decent villian we may forgive and possibly even forget, however a sadistic toymaker seems like it came from a 60's comic book.  The ""__ more days till Halloween"" theme is a pathetic replacement to the original theme, which makes me wonder why they tried to fix something that wasn't broken, if you're going to keep the name, please keep the theme song!

There, I've vented.  This movie needs no special treatment, it's widescreen, it's clean (although it's not widely rented so you'll probably find decent VHS copies as well), and it's got sound.  There's no special features, but this movie was a complete disappointment from start to finish.  I've heard plenty of people give this movie credit, but I just can't.  I'm a completist to nearly the ultimate degree, but I have yet to add this movie to my collection although I did rent it just to be sure.  No matter who you are, fan of the series or not, rent this first otherwise it will be watched once (if you're strong enough to make it to the end) and collect dust among your other Halloween movies.  I've actually been to all night marathons where this movie is vetoed off the playlist (in fact, every session I go to it's vetoed off the playlist).  In conclusion: PROCEED WITH CAUTION!",1093305600,2,3476,4.515974440894569

H3 is a great movie from the start (if you can get over the No MIke Myers excuse...).

838573,1,630428845X,"After the success of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" and Rick Rosenthal's ""Halloween II"", movie-goers should have known that a ""Halloween III"" was soon due. In 1981, a year after the release of ""Halloween II"", Tommy Lee Wallace's ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" was released, but it was a bit different than people had expected it to be. Rather than having a slasher flick about a group of people being chased around the town of Haddonfield, Illinois, by the masked psychopath Michael Myers, ""Halloween III"" had a totally different universe in which Michael Myers didn't exist, and rather than a slasher flick, there was a crazed mask maker planning on killing all the children on Halloween night. This movie wasn't a big success with most of the people, and it didn't deserve to be. The movie had was not scary at all, beyond weird in the story line, and it had no Michael Myers and wasn't even a slsher flick! What was up with this movie, and what were John Carpenter (original ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween II""), Deborah Hill (original ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween II""), and Tommy Lee Wallace (""Steven King's IT"") thinking?
To start, the first two ""Halloween"" films were suspense driven and scary, especially the first one. However, this movie was scary and didn't seem like it was made to be so. There were no suspensful parts, and with John Carpenter invloved, he usually makes a creepy flick. Actually, while watching it, ""Halloween III"" seemed as if it was made purely to milk out the ""Halloween"" title one more time and to show several different ways people could die in bizzare and strange ways. One instance is that the masks were a mystical type of mask that when a creepy tune played on the radio or TV, the masks began to kill the person wearing it by doing god knows what. Another instance is when a woman discovers a device used to program the killing masks is killed by the device. So strange its hard to explain and to understand. If you want a scary movie, don't rent this. If you want a gory movie, don't rent this. To be honest, don't rent this.
Second, the first two ""Halloween's"" had simple yet successful storylines. They were not complex and hard to imagine. Many horror movies don't have strange mystical occurances that kill people, but ""Halloween III"" did, and it was hard to understand. Most of the time in the movie you didn't know what was going on. One moment, the hero of the story, Dr. Dan Challis (Tom Atkins, who is the only reason anyone should even think about watching this movie) and his ditzy friend Ellie Grimbridge (Stacy Nelkin) are in a hospital mourning over Ellie's father, who just murdered by an android created by the crazed mask maker named Conol Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy). That's just complex enough, and the story isn't really even ten minutes into the story. The ending is also a little disturbing, and the whole movie will be one you won't enjoy.
Lastly, where's Michael? Where's the crazy guy that makes you scared to walk down the street alone at night? Where's the guy in a white mask? What is a ""Halloween"" movie without Michael Myers? And even if Carpenter didn't want to resurrect Myers for a third installment, he could have at least created a new killer, one that could run along the lines of Michael, Jason, Freddy, Leatherface, Ghostface, Chucky, or Norman Bates. People go to horror movies to get scared, and they perticularly go to ""Halloween"" movies to a slasher. But how can you have a slasher without a killer? Michael was luckily brought back for ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" and has been in the ""Halloween"" series ever since. This is the only hole in the series. ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" is the only one in the series that doesn't fit. It can be forgotten.
Overall, do not buy this movie. It is bad, very bad. There is no point to it, and there never will be. It is a discrace to the ""Halloween"" saga. With no chills or thrills, no story, and no Michael, it is no good. If you're watching and buying the series, watch ""Halloween"", then ""Halloween II"", then go straight to ""Halloween 4"" and skip ""Halloween III"". There's nothing here to want. Just forget it, completely. There are much better movies out there.",1088208000,5,4201,4.686062246278755

No Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasence or Michael Myers, is the reason fans will never like this movie.  The only thing is why this way? Yes the movie in genral has a nice score and is creepy but the fans were not expecting to see a movie about a movie away from the Myers storyline, with a plot about some evil guy trying to kill little kids by using mask and some other things.  I love the Halloween movies.  The original Halloween in 1978 directed by john Carpenter and Produced by Debra Hill is my favorite movie ever.  In my opinion the the best horror movie ever which had manny things copied from it from the Nightmare on Elm Street and Especially the Friday the 13th Series.  All we see is Myers in a commercial in this movie.  We eventually learn Michael Myers is in a coma at this time along with Dr. Loomis and Laurie Strode supposedly dead, in part 4 which probrably should have been part 3.  It's a good movie in it's own right, but dammit it is part III of the Halloween Series and we still did not get a Myers storyline, well I guess Mr. Myers and co. were in a coma.",1077753600,,1242,4.25531914893617

Call it Haunted Halloween or Masks of the Damned or something but to call it Halloween 3 has to be some kind of illegal slander.

Michael Myers not being in this film, was not the only reason why this was so bad. Horror movies are supposed to be scary. This one, Not scary at all!

838715,5,630428845X,"I'm always surprised at how underrated and under appreciated this movie is, mostly considering this is one of my top favorite movies, and my second favorite in the series, following the original.
I guess it's somewhat because of the great storyline. This movie totally abandons the Michael Myers storyline, and picks up a new one, not at all linked to the previous two movies. But, I figure, hey, what's the problem? Many people also say, okay, it's good, but why be a part of the Halloween series? Well, over time and being a big Halloween fan, I've come to enjoy it's little place in the series.
So, why the new plot? Here's the story. John Carpenter, who worked on the first two movies, first as a writer-director, and then just as a co-writer, figured that the way to continue the series was with a new plotline, which was...
Here is goes: About a week or so before Halloween, a man named Harry Grimbrige is stalked by these two suspiciously emotionless men, one of whom later grisly kills him at the Sierra Mesa hospital. But before his death, he's able to tell Dr. Dan Challis (a divorced, drunken wreck) a final statement: ""They're going to kill us! All of us!"" He's also clutching a Halloween mask in his hand, branding a Silver Shamrock trademark tag.
Teaming up with Mr. Grimbrige's daughter, Ellie, she and Dan find themselves in a little farming community named Santa Mira where Silver Shamrock Novelties holds its factory.
A series of gruesome murders and bizarre twists later leave Dan and Ellie on a fight for survival and to reveal the truth about the evil mask maker who runs Silver Shamrock named Conal Cochran (played brilliantly by Dan O'Heriley), who has a plan to systematically kill millions of children on Halloween night.
So what's great about this movie, you ask? I'll tell you. First off, the moody feel is terrific. The movie is very atmospheric, and director Tommy Lee Wallace knew what he was doing as far as keeping a great tone. Later in the movie, we come to believe the film's actually exposing the awful truths about the origins of the festival of Samhain (Halloween), and we get a great Halloween-event like feel.
""It was the beginning of the year in our old Celtic lands and we'd be waiting....the barriers would be down, you see, between the real and the unreal, and the dead might be looking in...""
It's an immensely skillful horror movie that's expertly structured, and I love every minute of it. Continuing with the atmosphere, John Carpenter and Alan Howarth return with great original music to set the scenes. A scene I specifically love for it's beauty it when Dan Challis and Ellie Grimbrige are driving to Santa Mira, reading about the town's history, and we get a view of the town's landscapes, which come in later foreboding with Conal Cochran's ""...the hills ran red..."" and his descriptions of the Celtic lands.
As far as the acting goes, it's not bad at all. Sure, it's not Oscar-winning or anything like that, but it's great and enough to let you believe the characters, especially Dan O'Heriley and Tom Atkins (who played Dr. Dan Challis).
So, it's a sad fact to learn just how maligned and hated this movie is. It's on the worst available DVD for the whole series, and remains very unknown. So, until maybe someday when it's appreciated more, ""Halloween III"" still has many fans along with myself who love the movie and think it deserves much better.",1072051200,16,3404,4.722689075630252
838716,2,630428845X,"It's been a while since I've seen this film, so my memory is rather foggy. The plot has something to do with masks that have become the latest craze among children.

On Halloween night, these children have been instructed to watch some commercial or program or something; they haven't been informed that when they watch it, the masks will horribly mutilate their faces or some crap.
I really appreciate the effort from John Carpenter to turn the series in a different direction, but this movie really is just plain bad.

But wait: there was a time when horror, SF and fantasy were about imagination, not spoon feeding people the same old stuff again and again. In this sense 'Season of the Witch' wins out over all its critics. Written by Nigel 'Quatermass' Kneale, it is naturally the usual intelligent mix of supernatural terror and eldritch science only Kneale's pen can deliver. If you enjoyed Carpenter's later 'Prince of Darkness' (which he scripted under the pseudonym Martin Quatermass as a homage to Kneale) then THIS is for you. If you just want more stalk and slash then stick with Jason Voorhees...
It's quite simple: if you are sharp, the sheer meanness of the trick (in the form of a treat) the pagan Irish villain of this movie plays on kids using remnants of an ancient artefact will chill you. If you want the old knife ritual, forget it.

838805,1,630428845X,"I rented this movie once about 4 years ago, and was so disappointed that I wanted my money back! It's incredible how one film can bring a horror series spiraling downward. Instead of having Michael Myers continuing his onslaught, we are introduced to a madmad who makes Halloween masks for kids, that have this Silver Shamrock label attached to them. When the kids watch the advertisement for the Silver Shamrock on TV while wearing the masks, their heads shink and are fried.... I guess. I can still remember the ""demonstration"" kid and how his head shrank, then bugs, then worms came out of his mouth, then a yellow rat snake, then a rattlesnake, which bit the father! It was so rediculous that I laughed. Needless to say, I wasn't laughing an any other point during the movie. I was waiting for something exciting to happen but nothing did. I would have given this movie 0 stars if I had the option.
Atkins seems to drop out of nowhere in this movie. He tries to stop the madman by having this girl lead him on a trail to his factory, where he is destroyed along with his Silver Shamrocks,( Wow, was that jingle annoying!). Then the girl turns out to be a robot, and he made love to her earlier? Yeah right. The plot didn't go anywhere, and neither did the action. This was not a horror film at all, but more like those ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK? episodes they used to show on Nickelodeon, and even some of those were scary.
I have no idea what John Carpenter had in mind when he made this. It is a good thing he took a backseat as producer or he would have been even more humiliated.  I'm guessing he tried something new and it didn't work. I personally think that Carpenter was considering making a whole series of Halloween movies with different stories. He started off with the Michael Myers story, and it was supposed to end after Halloween 2. Then he tried to introduce this theme that never got off the ground. If ""Halloween III"" was removed from the title, it might help resolve this film's bad reputation as an intruder to the Halloween series, though it wouldn't improve the quality of the film itself.

This story is ""Let's go save the children of the world from the diabolical plot of a madman"", whereas the Michael Myers-focused flicks are all about ""Surving through the night"".  The least they could've done was keep in the spirit of the previous films.  It's okay trying to do something a little different, but this is a complete turnaround for the series, and it really could've just been titled ""Season of the Witch"" and it wouldn't make any difference.
Basically, my main complaint is that this film doesn't fit at all into the same horror sub-genre as any of the other films in the series, and that's just plain wrong.

If you are trying looking for formula shocks, buckets of gore and special effects this movie will disappoint you. Moreover, Michael Myers is not in it, which makes it stand on it's own unlike all the Halloween sequals after it. However, if you are looking for something novel in a saturated genre that has tight scripting, descent direction, and good acting this will prove refreshing. Even though this movie is directed by Tommy Lee Wallace it has a strong feeling of John Carpenter from the music to how it was lensed. For fans of John Carpenter's work, the pacing in not unlike his movies 'The Fog' and 'Village of the Damned' and should be checked out.

Tom Atkins puts in one of his cheesiest performances, next to ""Night of the Creeps"" (at least that movie was entertaining in a velveeta sort of way). Stacy Nelkin wasn't any better. Dan O'Herlihy...needless to say his performance in the film didn't exactly set off his film career. What is a Halloween movie without that psychotic serial killer Michael Myers?

The only thing I can think of that is good is the director, but he made a terrible mistake with this movie. So I give it a 1 star. For that one factor. People may say this movie is okay and stuff.

SInce he was killed and tired of the Michael formula, producers John Carpenter and Debra Hill decided to tale a new approach on the Halloween franchise. The original plan was to release a Halloween film eveery few years that had completely different stories and had different characters. Since the movie audiences were too bull headed to take this idea, the film failed. Maybe audiences would have accepted tis movie better wothout the ""III"" in the title, such as HALLOWEEN: SEASON OF THE WITCH, suffesting mabybe that this isn't a direct sequel to the original gruesome twosome.

Overall I enjoyed this film, with only some minor complaints. What wasnj't explained and I didn't get was why the childrens heads burst into bugs and snakes when they viewed the telivision commercial that triggers their deadly masks. Why not have their heads explode or somehting else, because the bugs made no sense, but this easily forgiven. I give Tommy Lee Wallace thumbs up with this effort, an effort that every Carpenter fan should like. As most of you know, this is the last entry Carpenter had anything to do with.

First they endured aliens (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) and now an evil conspiracy involving old world sorcery combined with new world technology to create an unspeakable horror in Halloween III: Season of the Witch.

I rather enjoyed this movie.  From reading reviews, it seems the biggest problem people have is being a sequel of the original movie, they are disappointed by the fact Michael Myers isn't in the movie.  I've read that since Michael died in the second movie, the intent was to create new sequels, each involving different tales relating to Halloween.  Only problem was that this movie was poorly received, so the idea was canned and Michael was brought back for the next movie.  I would have liked to have seen where the original idea would have led myself.  As a stand alone movie, I thought this was pretty good.  After the strange murder of a patient in his hospital, Dr. Dan Chalis (Tom Atkins) meets the daughter of the recently deceased, Elle Grimbridge (Stacy Nelkin) and together they investigate the mystery behind her father's death.  This leads them to the town of Santa Mira, the Silver Shamrock Toy Company and it's mysterious owner, Conal Cochran, played by Dan O'Herlihy.  As the story moves along, the conspiracy slowly reveals itself, and we can see the extent of the plan.  As Dan and Elle get captured, we now see them not only trying to expose the plans, but fight for their very lives.  While the movie did move along pretty well, there were some points that sort of dragged, but not, in my opinion because of the actors, but because of the script.  The dialogue was a little clunky in some areas, sort of drawing me out of the movie.  There were many aspects I would have liked to seen developed more, like the witchcraft angle, or the technical elements, but that's the way it goes.  The one part I did find unsettling was the death of that young child.  Yeah, he was annoying, but it seems pretty rare that young children get killed in these movies.  I am not saying I wish that scene wasn't in the movie, as it was actually integral to the story, just like in Jaws when the shark killed the Kitner boy.  I am just used to teenagers or adults as victims in these types of movies, not young children.

No extras, but a really good presentation of an often misaligned movie.  Had this movie had a different name, I am sure it would have been better received.  I guess if you are going to call your movie a Halloween sequel, it better have Michael Myers in it.",1066003200,28,2622,4.571734475374733

It does have its cheesy 80s aspects, but it's an interesting plot that will make you think and have many questions going through your mind even after the film ends.  This movie would be considered a masterpiece if people were able to just get past the fact that this is NOT a Michael Myers movie.
As for the DVD itself, I originally had the out of print Goodtimes release but sold it for the new Universal version and I'd say its a slightly better change.  The picture quality is a tad better and as for the sound it's deffinatley an obvious improvement.  However, no special features at all, not even a theatrical trailer as originally promised.  I guess that's why its a cheap price.  Oh well; I would have loved to have seen some features on this new release but it's still well worth the money.  So for those that are yet to see this movie, I suggest you check it out and watch it with a completly open mind.  Chances are you will like it because it's a shockingly well made film.",1065830400,4,1373,4.286821705426356
838924,5,630428845X,"Even though Halloween 1 and 2 are probably the best films out of the entire Halloween series, I have to say that I really enjoyed Halloween III: Season of the Witch! Even though Michael Myers does not make an appearance in this film, it is definitely worth trying out.
The story revolves mainly around the Silver Shamrock company which makes novelty items. The owner of the company comes up the diabolical plan to teach children a lesson about the REAL meaning of Halloween. He advertises ""special"" Halloween masks that the children flock to get. On Halloween night, a commercial runs on television that will ultimately kill all of the children, melting their heads and making various insects spill out. There is also a side story in which robots, who work for Silver Shamrock, go around doing anything necessary (including killing) to make sure that the secrets of the Silver Shamrock company remain hidden. A doctor and a murdered toyshop owner's daughter become wrapped up in this plan and try to put a stop to it. The ending will shock you!
I really enjoyed this film because it was very interesting and kept me glued to the screen the entire time. You will also find yourself singing along to the infectious jingle that plays everytime the Silver Shamrock commercial airs. Halloween III is a good departure and break from the Michael Myers saga. I would highly recommend this film!!!!",1063756800,13,1389,4.840336134453781
838925,4,630428845X,"John Carpenter and Debra Hill never wanted to make a sequel to HALLOWEEN.  So much so they had problems writing HALLOWEEN 2, and came up with it only under the threat it would be made with or without them.  So when HALLOWEEN 3 came around they proposed a radical idea ... ""Let's do a HALLOWEEN-themed movie every year, and they have nothing to do with Michael Meyers!""  Well ... it was a good idea, but it made less money than expected so Halloween 4 saw THE RETURN oF MICHAEL, and the rest is history.
But give the movie a chance!  It's a coy salute to INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (also set in mythical Santa Mira!) mixed with some old fashioned paganism and the spirit of the holiday!  You get the paranoid tale of a doctor and a daughter who investigate the murder of a mask seller and find that a horrible plot has been hatched to decimate the youth of America in a large scale Halloween TRICK that will give an evil warlock a lot of power.  There is the plot in one ungodly long run-on sentence!
What's to like?  The music is awesome as always, the mood is creepy, and you get to see Dick Warlock (Michael of HALLOWEEN 2) unmasked as a killer robot in a suit (corporate America!).  Watch out also for HALLOWEEN alumna Nancy Loomis playing the good doctor's harpy ex-wife!  There is no Michael, but he pops up on television quite a few times in a sly homage to the HALLOWEEN frenzy that followed the first of the series.

839024,5,630428845X,"People will no doubt complain about there being no Michael Myers in this movie. Boo-hoo, cry yourself a river. GET OVER IT, geeks.

Tom Atkins, star of such excellent cinematic masterpieces as Night of the Creeps and The Fog, is at the height of his acting prowess here. He plays Dan Challis, an alcoholic doctor who is a hit with the ladies much to the dismay of his ex-wife played by the always-lovely Nancy Loomis.

What makes this film one of the most brilliant of the 1980s is its completely crazy concept. Think about it: An old Irish warlock stealing one of the stones from Stonehenge (with the help of his druid automatons) so he could chips pieces off it, put those pieces into Halloween masks, and sell them to children so their heads are crushed in a shower of blood and insects.

That's brilliance incarnate, people.

Another spot of brilliance is that the previously mentioned druid automatons put on gloves before they murder as if the police could possibly get their fingerprints and trace them back to Santa Mira, California, home of Silver Shamrock Novelties.

And that brings me to Silver Shamrock Novelties. Is this not a social statement on how a powerful company can take over a town? (example: Walmart) Director Tommy Lee Wallace wasn't just giving us an entertaining homage to Invasion of the Body Snatchers. He was warning us about the dangers of mass production, greedy children, and indulgent parents. The town of Santa Mira is an empty shell of a town thanks to the business but apparently they owe a lot to Silver Shamrock Novelties. You know, big businesses pump a lot of money into the economy so how dare you criticize the curfews and the surveillance cameras?

The ""witch"" (warlock?) of the movie is Conal Cochran. What makes him such a creepy villain is how calm he is. He doesn't run around like a maniac. In fact, his grandfatherly personality makes me wish he was MY grandfather. He's a charming dude. That's another social statement: the smooth businessman infiltrating society in order to fulfill his own self-serving agenda. Evil? That guy? No way, he's sweet as pie. He might as well be Andy Griffith.

Another thing I like about this movie is the hospital. Tom Atkins is a doctor in one of the most empty hospitals I've seen outside of an actual abandoned hospital. That makes for a pretty spooky setting (albeit an unrealistic one reminiscent of the hospital in Halloween 2).

It's an entertaining flick. Is the plot flawless? No, of course not. But considering the set-up, the plot pretty much bumps along the way you'd expect but with some slight twists and turns that make it pretty interesting. Which brings us to the ending.

The ending is brilliantly nihilistic. One of the best endings OF ALL TIME. It's every parent's worst nightmare: something seemingly harmless you buy your kid turns out to be the very thing that kills them. TERRIFYING. Thing about all the children who choke on toys their parents bought them. That's horrible, right? Well imagine it on a grander scale.

So all your Halloween 3 haters need to take the silver spoon out of your mouths and appreciate a somewhat campy but still creepy 80s horror movie that has a unique and original concept. It's miles beyond all the Halloween by-the-numbers slasher sequels and imitators.",1052697600,2,3293,4.8021201413427566

The story is more creative than the rest of the series and the level of acting is adequate.  The only gripe I have really are the quality of the DVD's themselves.

839133,5,630428845X,"Here is my rant regarding all of the criticism - and it has been a lot recently, hasn't it? - directed toward the maligned Halloween III: Season of the Witch: Hogwash! The movie is not an epic. But the main thrust of the film still ""works"" despite the absence of Myers, eternal villain. I have argued in my thesis that the Silver Shamrock theme rescues the film, lifting it to the level of ""a very good horror flick"" while not compromising its hardened slasher-flick mentality. It compares favorably to Friday the 13th Part V, a black sheep sibling of the original version. If nothing else, it surpasses Jaws III, which clearly was a flop but at least still had the damn shark. I watch Season of the Witch every couple months and still, on rainy days as Halloween approaches, find myself - in a fast food restaurant, bank or library - pulling out a mask and singing the harmonious, melodic Silver Shamrock jingle. And I must say, it usually does not take long before a passerby points out, ""Hey, that tune is from Halloween III: Season of the Witch. I love that, dude."" And I say, ""Thank you, dude."" To balance this critique, I respectfully offer the following suggestion that would have elevated the movie - Myers be damned - to the rarefied heights of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Leprechaun 3: They should have casted a young Meg Ryan. Why not, right? The talented actress appeared in Amityville 3: It's about time (a film that provokes vomiting with astonishing success, but that's another story for another day), and may have been willing to star in Season of the Witch. I honestly do not know, it should be noted, but people vastly familiar with early 1980s gore movies and habits have told me in confidence that she may or may not have agreed to ""be in it"" depending upon whether she was or was not asked and by whom. What's more, Ryan clearly would have been a natural progression after Curtis' post-Part Two vanishing act. The avalanche of criticism recently aimed at Season of the Witch speaks more to a lack of appreciation for Silver Shamrock and the spellbinding horror the tune creates. In any case, to conclude: I don't need Myers to spark sensations of fear and anxiety down my spine or pelvic region. This, The Season of the Witch, is ""a very good horror flick"" that succeeds in spite of, or perhaps because of, Myers' absence.",1043884800,5,2344,4.610047846889952

The guy who played Cochran was a man who is intent on killing kids with masks and a commercial that would trigger a laser to fry hte child's head causing him/her to die, decompose and have snakes and many other thigns to come out, really discusting and cool.

Cons: But, however it really should been called 'Season of the Witch' as a standalone movie, not as  'Halloween III'. And of course it is dated, because I doubt Commodore 64 Graphics would kill anyone (Except for the latest technophiles)

When it was time for Johm Carpenter and Debra Hill to make another Halloween film, they decided that the Michael Myers character was tired and played out. So they tried something new and fresh with Halloween 3: Season Of The Witch. Being a fan of horror, Carpenter's original idea was to release a new Halloween film every few years, each one with a totally new plot and original characters. His idea was to bring in new directors and serve as a producer for these original scary tales. Well the close-minded public couldn't accept a film with the Halloween heading and no Michael Myers, so the idea was scrapped. Well I used to ditch school to watch this on The Movie Channel in the 80's, so I guess you could say I like it. A sinister warlock that wants to kill thousands of children on Halloween night. Robotic killers that can pull your head right off your shoulders. Masks that use the power of Stonehenge and ancient witchcraft to turn brains into snakes, beetles and millipedes.

839409,4,630428845X,"Physician Tom Atkins witnesses one of his patients brutally murdered by an emotionless and extremely powerful killer, who afterward sets fire to himself.  The victim was a delirious man off the street, clutching a halloween mask and raving something about a horrible plot about to occur on Halloween night.  Atkins and the victim's daughter, Stacy Nelligan, want to find out what is going on, and follow their only clue  -  the mask, manufactured by toymaker Dan O'Herlihy.  Atkins and Nelligan take a little tour of O'Herlihy's plant, and uncover an insidious terrorist plot to murder millions of innocent children on Halloween night...
This is one of the most original horror movies ever made, playing more like a spy story than anything else  -  if it were packaged slightly differently, with the alteration of only one or two elements, it could have been in the James Bond series.  John Carpenter and Alan Howarth's electronic score is more effective for this entry than any of their other Halloween movies, owing to the high-tech nature of the plot, which is sci-fi/horror at its finest.  Nelligan is mostly around for the scenery, though she is fine in her role, Atkins makes a believably reluctant hero, and O'Herlihy is simply superb.
The only flaws in this film are that it is uneven and that it suffers an excess of gore, though the gore is admittedly quite effective.  It also includes one truly gratuitous murder scene involving a power drill that simply doesn't work  -  in fact, it kills the momentum of the plot, at that particular point in the story.  The clever script was the work of veteran British horror screenwriter Nigel Kneale (author of the excellent Quatermass series), who had his name removed from the credits.

839413,5,630428845X,"Hey, I admit it. When I was younger, I fell into the trap of bashing this film due to it's title. Luckily, as I got older, I began to appreciate what TRUE horror is and appreciate a suspensful CLASSIC for what it was.

""Halloween III"" is a stand alone film is a franchise of films best known for serial killer, Michael Myers. While ""Halloween III"" does not star Michael Myers, it is a fantastic film that gets unfairly criticized because many fans, and critics either compare it to the original, or lump it in with the rest of the films in the franchise.

""Halloween III"" has all of the elements that make up a fantastic thriller. For starters, John Carpenter's AMAZING synth score is one of the best I've ever heard. The setting and atmosphere are perfect and the film has some BRILLIANT shots that I've never forgotten, like the silhouetted, children walking through the Phoenix twilight with a shot of the city lights in the backround. Still one of the most eerie sights I can remember.

The film has it's flaws, sure. What horror film doesn't? One critic said it was hard to phathom how somebody could ship pieces of stonehenge across the Atlantic, LOL! Come on man, it's a horror film. It's fantasy. It's not meant to be analyzed, it's meant to be entertaining.

Dr. Challis(Tom Atkins, ""The Fog"", ""Escape From New York"", ""Night of the Creeps) takes in scared patient, Harry Grimbridge(Al Berry) who clings on to a Halloween mask, and begins trembling, and muttering ""They're going to kill us"" when he hears a Silver Shamrock commercial. A few hours later, the man is tracked down by a killer in a business suit. The murder is a mystery, so Dr. Challis and the man's daughter, Ellie Grimbridge(Stacy Nelkin) try to figure out the mystery behind her father's death. Their search leads them to Santa Mira California, the home of Silver Shamrock Novelties. Here they meet up with the founder, and creator Conal Cochran(Dan O'herlihy). As they begin to get closer to the truth, Cochran has his men kidnap Ellie, setting a trap for Dr. Challis. Once they have Challis in custody, Conal Cochran reveals his, frightening, master plan.

The film gets a lot of crticism, but if people would open their mind, like I did, I think you could really appreciate, and enjoy the film for what it is. A stand alone in a Michael Myers franchise.

John Carpenter's plan for the franchise, after ""Halloween II"" was to make Halloween films, more in the tradition of ""The Outer Limits"" or ""The Twilight Zone"". Only on a grander scale. Each film would tell a different story, and each film would take place on Halloween. After the film got crushed by fans, and critics, he abandoned the idea, and has had nothing to do with the franchise since 1982.

It's a shame because I would've loved to have seen where the franchise could've went from here.
I love the Michael Myers character as much as the next guy, hell, ""Halloween"" (1978) is not only my favorite horror film, it's my favorite ALL TIME film.

Go into this film with an open mind. Think of it's title as ""Season of the Witch"" and distance it from the other films in the franchise. You might just suprise yourself at how entertaining and creative this film, truly, is.",1016668800,2,3206,4.651943462897527

I am glad that this movie took the chance with a new concept. I really hate how companies drag out marketable characters through successively worse sequals.

839553,3,630428845X,"I admit that I was one of them. 'Them' who? Those who jumped on the wagon to attack and ridicule Halloween III. Not saying it's a great classic or anything, but I spewed venom it's way for years because there was no Michael Myers, and wasn't really a part of the already established Halloween franchise, namely Michael/Laurie/Loomis/Carpenter's original theme, etc. So, it was just automatically bad. But then a funny thing happened. I grew up. I got older, watched the movie again and more often, and started to see it on it's own terms. And you know what? I liked it. It certainly wasn't the abomination I, and so many others, thought it was. On it's own, it was a serviceable and fun little movie.

Tom Atkins (""The Fog"", ""Creepshow"") stars as Dr. Dan Challis. One night, after a patient is mysteriously killed, he and the man's daughter (Stacey Nelkin)investigate the strange death. Their hunt leads them to the small, eerie town of Santa Mira, where the head of the Silver Shamrock company, Colonel Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy), has devised an evil plan that will target all the children in America on Halloween night.

""Season Of The Witch"" is not high art, and it may not even feature a witch, but it's a movie that's better than it's reputation makes you think. At the fiery end of ""Halloween II"", it looked as though Michael's days were over. So, why not continue the terror, but with a new story? Obviously, with the ""3"" in the title, it tricked people into thinking it was a regular Halloween movie and were upset. If you remove the 'Halloween' legacy away from it, go into the movie as it's own thing, you will find a movie not deserving of all the scorn. Writer/Director Tommy Lee Wallace, who worked on the original ""Halloween"", tried his best to do something different. And it was different. The main storyline with Colonel Cochran wanting to massacre all these innocent kids on Halloween night is a dark idea, but once the Stonehenge and mystical stuff comes into play, it just all becomes too hokey and confusing. The only thing that saves it is the wonderful performance of Dan O'Herlihy. He has the sweet, old man face and warm voice one moment, and has a look of pure evil the next. His character and performance is truly the best of the movie. Atkins is fine as the leading man, and Nelkin is fetching in her role, even if it is a typical and by the numbers one. In other areas, the film has a great score, once again provided by John Carpenter, with Alan Howarth. It has eerie and interesting locations, interesting directing touches here and there, and a great eerie vibe that only these kinds of movies from the early 80s could provide.

There are some fun 'wink wink' things here and there too. ""Halloween"" can be seen playing on TV a few times. A character is referred to as ""Dr. Castle"", referring, I'm sure, to original Shape actor, Nick Castle. Dick Warlock, who played Michael in Part II, appears here in numerous scenes as one of Cochran's men. And, if that isn't enough, Nancy Kyes(Loomis), who played Annie in ""Halloween"", appears here as Atkins' wife.

""Halloween III"" may not be a hallmark in the 'Halloween' franchise, but it definitley stands out. It's an interesting way to spend Halloween, and although it has it's problems, it should be seen as it's own movie, and not just ""that stupid one that doesn't even have Michael Meyers in it!"". I would still rather watch this one over and over again than Part 6, Resurrection, or Rob Zombie's horrendous offerings.

It has absoloutley NOTHING, I repeat, NOTHING to do with the first two that came before it, or the 5 that came after it.  There is NO Michael Myers.  There is NO Jamie Lee Curtis.  There is NO Doneld Pleasance.  There is NO Haddonfield.  As long as you know all this, you'll propably enjoy this crazy entry.  What we DO get in this is a weird plot that involves robots, killer masks, bugs, snakes, and a psycho TV commercial.
The plot begins as we watch a man running down the streets, panting.  A car is following him.  Out of the car comes a man in a buisness suit, who tries to strangle the other man.  This buisness suited man, however, gets crushed by a car (I won't say how), and the other guy runs off to a gas station, where he scares the daylights out of a worker.  The worker takes him to a hospital, where he's put to the care of Dr. Dan Challis (Tom Atkins, The Fog, Lethal Weopon).  This guy's raving about people trying to kill him, but the doctor thinks he's looney.  In 10 minutes the man is dead, with a skull ripped open by another buisness suited man (Dick Warlock, the man who played Michael Myers in Halloween II). This here man proceeds to blow himself up in his car.  Challis is very disturbed by this incident, and asks a friend of his to study the ashes.  He is even more disturbed when he meets this dead mans daughter, Ellie Grimbridge (Stacie Nelkin).  Together, they go and investigate the strange town of Santa Mira, where her father was last seen.  They head out to the  factory, Silver Shamrock Novelties, owned by creepy Conal Cochron (Dan O'Herily, Robocop 1 and 2), who makes the most popular masks in the world.  It seems that every kid in town is wearing one of these masks on Halloween night, and at 9:00 they're all going to watch this ""Big Give-Away"" Cochron's putting on TV.  What do you think Cochron's gonna do with this commercial?  The answer is in this movie, a pretty strange one I must say.  It was originally NOT a Halloween movie at all, but they added the title later, because John Carpenter and Debra Hill had a whole thing planned out for this series.  They were going to make each movie different, like an episode of The Twilight Zone.  But, this movie BOMBED at the box-office, causing Michael Myers to return in Part 4.  Actually, I like this movie a lot.  It's got a good, B-movie type story.  Also, some of the performances are hilarious for how (perhaps purposefully) bad they are.  Tom Atkins, Dan O' Herlihy, and Stacie Nelkin offer good performances, but oh-boy that Cuffer family was a set of the worst actors ever put on film!!  It's hilarious!  Most of the other actors (except that guy who owns the motel) are pretty good.  Also, look for a small appearence in the third scene by Nancy Kyes/Loomis, who played Annie in Halloween 1 and 2.  Here, she plays Challise's ex-wife, Linda. While the movie isn't related to the first and second, there's a lot of little pokes at those ones, most noticebly how Halloween is on TV in two scenes, and how Dick Warlock plays that assasin at the beggining.
This Goodtimes DVD is nothing to exciting.  The picture's very good, as is the sound.  We haven't any extra features, not even a trailer, but, this is Goodtimes, remember?  I'm sure if you're patient, this movie will come back out on DVD owned by Universal (just like Part 2).

839559,3,630428845X,"""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" is, I'd have to say, the most under-rated of the Halloween films.  It gets it's bad reputation because it's the only film in the series that does not feature Michael Myers prominently (he is actually seen in the movie during a scene at a bar when a commercial for a broadcast of the original film comes on a T.V.).
Basically, this one centers around a mysterious Halloween mask production company's plot to kill all the children in the United States by planting small metallic devices inside the rubber masks that, when worn by the children during a special T.V. broadcast on Halloween night, will cause them to die a rather gruesome death via the excretion of snakes and other creepy crawlies from inside their bodies.  It's up to a man and his female partner to unlock the company's sinister secrets and bring it their evil plans to a halt before it's too late.
I know, sounds a little off-beat, but who cares.  For anyone who is willing to look past the absence of Michael Myers and appreciate this film for what it is, I highly recommend you watch this one.  It's not on T.V. that often, so you'll probably have to either rent it or buy it.
If you're a die-hard fan of the series and don't have this in your video collection yet, I would encourage you to purchase it.  However, if you're only a moderate fan I'd say rent it first.
Even if you're not a fan of the series but like horror/sci-fi films (this one has a little bit from both genres) in general, I definitely encourage you to give this one a shot.
P.S. For those who still continue to wonder why Carpenter went this route for the third installment, the answer is simple.  When ""Halloween II"" came out critics constantly bashed the film by saying that it was too much like the first one.  Listening to the critics, John and the rest of the people behind ""III"" decided to make it a completely different film.  The moral to the story, if you get what you asked for and still aren't happy, just shut up.  Unfortunately, though, critics never seem to be able to shup up.",995932800,2,2066,4.473404255319149
839560,5,630428845X,"I feel I must defend this movie, even though I'm sure mine isn't the popular opinion in this case. I fondly recall seeing it in the theater when I was 7 years old, in 1982, and remember loving it even then. Sure, the plot has nothing to do with the original Halloween and its many sequels (as has been repeated here ad nauseum), but it's a charming little standalone film and deserves better reviews than it's been getting here! If this movie was not called ""Halloween III"" and had nothing to do with the Halloween franchise, would the reviews still be so bad? Possibly, but looking at the movie on its own, I can honestly say I've seen a thousand times worse than this. Half the complaints I see are that there's no Michael Meyers, Laurie Strode or Dr. Loomis in it... so what? The movie makes up for that with a decently creepy and unique plot, some rather disgusting scenes if you're even halfway squeamish, and some good old fashioned scenes where the not-so-jaded viewer might even jump.
The movie is classic - ""Eight more days till Halloween, Halloween, Halloween... Eight more days till Halloween, Silver Shamrock!"" That song is incredibly catchy, memorable to the point where you might find yourself singing it a week later, and is horrific in itself, because it's basically a sugar-coated countdown to mass murder! Don't forget the scarily amusing kids on TV, bopping to the beat, in special masks... Not to mention the bugs - perhaps I'm biased, as the only things that EVER affect me in horror movies are bugs... ugh. At any rate, I tend to think of this movie as at least one of my top 25 favorite horror movies of the 1980's. It can be cheesy, but in the best way possible, and I know I'd certainly choose to watch this over some of the rather dismal, trendy 90's ""horror"" movies, which have unfortunately gotten MUCH better reviews. I guess it's really all a matter of taste.
The movie never claimed to have Michael Meyers in it, so try not to feel so ripped off because you just assumed he'd be in it. If you watch the movie with an open mind, dim the lights and pop some popcorn, you might find that you'll actually enjoy it.",994723200,42,2141,4.520618556701031

839613,4,630428845X,"Hindsight, as we all know, is 20/20!  In looking back on this movie, one can appreciate what producers John Carpenter and Debra Hill were trying to do with this film.  The idea of turning the ""Halloween"" movies into more of an anthology series is novel indeed.  However, we all know now what a disaster it turned into as fans of the first two were expecting more of the same.  Perhaps if they just went with the subtitle, ""Season of the Witch"" it may have gotten more recognition.  That said, I saw this film, knowing it had nothing to do with the previous entries and found myself enjoying it.  It has all the suspense and atmosphere of the first two, but avoids the very tired ""slasher"" route all together.  Tommy Lee Wallace does an admirable job on his first outing as director, setting up the plot nicely.  Also, the widescreen DVD preserves Dean Cundey's magnificent cinematography to the hilt.  The storyline pays homage to several Horror classics as ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""The Stepford Wives"" and even Carpenter's ""Halloween"".  Tom Atkins (a veteran of several Carpenter films, most notably ""The Fog"") turns in a good performance as a highly unlikely hero, who just happens to be an alcholoic, womanizing dead-beat father of two!  Atkins is joined by then newcomer Stacy Nelkin, who comes to him to help her discover the cause of her father's mysterious death.  Their investigation leads them to a small town called Santa Mira (named after the town in ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers""), which is the home of Silver Shamrock, a manufacturing company that makes Halloween masks.  Here they meet Conal Cochrane,played by Dan O'Herlihy (""Robocop""), who gives the film's best performance as a wealthy toymaker with a dark secret.  As Atkins begins delving deeper into the mystery, Cochrane's horrifying secret is revealed.  Silver Shamrock is producing masks that will, on Halloween night, kill millions of children around the country.  While the film does have it's occasional plot holes and lapses of logic, it's certainly entertaining and remains a guilty pleasure of mine.  For those ""Halloween"" fans who disdained the film for not continuing the ""Michael Myers"" story, I would say give it another viewing.  It certainly doesn't compare to the original, but knowing after this the producers went back to the slasher format of the first two, five more times (with more to come I'm sure), there's no more reason to hold that excuse over this film.  I'm glad to see others who have reviewed this have also come to the same conclusion.  Looking back, this film is no where near as bad as it's reputed to be!",993600000,,2622,4.8758465011286685
839614,4,630428845X,"Sure, just like everyone else, I was disappointed with the fact that Michael Myers wasn't in this and that it had nothing to do with the plot, but really, if you don't think of it as a ""Halloween"" movie, then it is actually a pretty good movie. The director, Tommy Lee Wallace, once noted that he wishes the producers hadn't called it a Halloween movie, because he felt that the main reason this is the most hated in the series is because everyone expected a continuation of parts 1 and 2. Well, after I opened my mind a little more, I started to enjoy this movie. It is extremely creepy and even cruel, one of the few horror movies I have ever seen where someone under the age of 12 gets killed. The plot is pretty tight, with (surprisingly) very little holes. The only thing that weighted this movie down was the horrible acting by Tom Atkins and his even more horrible character, a womanizing doctor who never took care of his kids. Sorry, but that's not the kind of guy I wanna see survive a horror movie. Some of the effects were really hokey (Colonel Cochrane vaporizing...). But the film has some pretty gruesome and unsettling death scenes, which is why I don't really understand why the average horror fans loathes this film. Anyways, what I am trying to get at is, if you don't look at this as HALLOWEEN III : SEASON OF THE WITCH and just think of it as SEASON OF THE WITCH, then you are almost guaranteed to enjoy yourself. *Disclaimer* This movie has nothing to do with witches.",992131200,3,1490,4.4416058394160585

In fact, the only onscreen connection with this film's predecessor, Halloween 2, is Dick Warlock (what a great name for horror films) who played ""The Shape"" in Halloween 2 and here he's unmasked and plays an android assassain.  Anyhow, Halloween 3 is the story of a sinister mask maker (played by Dan O'Herlihy) who develops a diabolical plot to kill America's children with his Silver Shamrock Halloween masks.  It's a pretty good story that, in some ways might remind you of the original ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers.""  It's also a social commentary on the brainwashing that occurs in certain children's advertising.  The electronic synthesizer score, by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth, is eerie and is one of their best collaborative scoring efforts.
Goodtimes' DVD looks good, thanks to the widescreen presentation and Dean Cundey's photography.  Sadly, the film's sound is presented in mono which is curious since Goodtimes also released Halloween 2 and that presentation was released in surround sound.

Nonetheless, only two people (Tom Atkins and Stacey Nelkin) are onto his scheme, and they try to stop him before he can carry out his plan.  Nothing terrific, but I wouldn't dismiss this entirely.  Certainly original, with some neat special effects.  Those squeamish about snakes and bugs and spiders coming out of one's mouth might want to look elsewhere.

839694,3,630428845X,"I'll start with the obvious -- to correct another reviewer, John Carpenter WAS involved with Halloween III.  He worked on the first three films.  He wrote, directed, and did the music for the first.  He wrote and produced Halloween II, along with collaborating with Alan Howarth on the music.  He produced Halloween III, and again made the music along with Howarth.  After that, he left the series.
Carpenter, after HII, stated that Michael Myers was dead forever and it was time for move on.  When producer Moustapha Akkad clamored for another, Carpenter came up with a plan to release an entirely separate Halloween film every year, all centered around the holiday but with unique stories.  When this film bombed, that concept died.
It didn't just bomb, in fact.  Stories were reported that in cities such as New York, filmgoers expecting another Myers film actually pulled the seats up from the floors and threw them into the screen.  But, does this movie deserve that treatment?
That all depends on you.  If you expect another slasher film, or another Myers film, you will likely be disappointed.  This film is entirely unique.  To some, the combination of Celtic mythology, mad scientists, deadly Halloween masks and robot henchmen is just horribly cheesy.  Others embrace that cheese.
If you can get past those concepts and embrace the cheesiness of them, you'll likely find a surpring amount to like in this film.  If you don't tolerate such silly ideas as android bad guys in your horror films, there's not much chance this will set well with you.

839697,3,630428845X,"BIG DISCLAIMER: HALLOWEEN III HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MICHAEL MYERS!!!! Okay, now with that out of the way, you may be able to enjoy this film for what it is without trying to compare it to other Halloween movies. It has a good storyline and is well-acted.
While making ""Halloween III"", the filmmakers had the idea of releasing a new Halloween film each year with a different storyline, and ""H3"" was the first, and sadly last film under that concept. It bombed at the box office and was widely trashed by fans, mainly because it veered off the Michael Myers path. The backlash forced producers to go back to the tired slasher motif for future ""Halloween"" films, none of which were worth the film they were printed on. ""Halloween III"" would've fared better if they simply titled it ""Season of the Witch"". And for those who wonder where the witch was in the film, chief antagonist Conal Cochran is a Warlock (i.e. male witch).
The film is very Cthulhu-esque in its mood. The plot is very creepy. Conal Cochran (portrayed nicely by Dan O'Herlihy) is a mask & novelty magnate, who more or less controls a small town in California. He's also a Warlock, part of a long line of Irish Druids, and is not happy with the commercialization of Hallow's Eve. So what better way to keep his tradition alive than sacrificing millions of kids on Halloween night? He devises a master plan which includes to use of his masks, computer chips laced with stonehenge dust, a catchy TV commercial, and android goons who do the necessary dirty work, killing those who know too much.
Dan Challis (Tom Atkins) & Ellie (Stacy Nelkin) become caught up in the scheme and are determined to find out what is behind the murder of Ellie's father, who owned a novelty store and bought masks from Cochran. The story unfolds as they do their detective work, climaxes at the Silver Shamrock factory, and ends all too ironically. It's not a gore-fest, but more of a thinking-man horror film. The plot slowly dawns on our heroes & viewers as we go.
I have two  complaints. The storyline moves very slowly. It's a good plot, but could have been better if the plot unfolded quicker. My second complaint is the inclusion of the androids. The story would've been much creepier if they were simply human cronies or zombies. Overall, it's a decent horror film and a nice break from the slasher genre. Give it a shot if you need a break from the gore-in-your-face horror film.",980985600,3,2429,4.622685185185185

The movie takes place in Santa Mira,CA where a warlock controls everything. Bizarre events happen in this ""company town"",but I won't give away too much. The directing by Wallace is well done and the music score by Carpenter/Howarth is actually BETTER than in the first two movies(listen for those ""stingers""),almost Gothic.

839700,1,630428845X,"I've had the pleasure or the displeasure, considering your persuasion in regard to shocking horror movies, to view the third installment of Halloween, Season of the Witch. Who's idea was it to attach the Halloween moniker to this movie was clearly looking to capitalize on the popularity of the previous two movies featuring Laura Strode, Dr. Loomis and Michael Myers. This second sequel to Halloween has almost no connection with its predecessors, primarily because it doesn't feature any of the said characters.
What Season does feature is an interesting plot involving a Druid plan to execute the ultimate prank: To avenge the besmirching of their holiday Halloween. Halloween was a day of celebration of the dead, the day in which the decease and the demons and the witches could freely walk amongst the living. Then, you have this pagan holiday bastardized and commercialized for the amusement of children parading around in masks or caricatures of the dead and of demons scaring people to give them food.
Conal Cochran is the Druid engineer of this plot which involves fragments from Stonehenge to rig masks that will bring forth a deadly plague to the masks's wearers and anyone within directly proximity.
This by itself is a unique and intriguing notion for a horror movie, a twist on the original interpretation of Halloween; however, it has no bearing to the other movies in the Halloween series.

The acting is decent, Dan O'Herlihy is a great villain, Tom Atkins is  a convincing guy-who-gets-caught-up-in-something-big and Stacy Nelkin plays  a great '80's chick.
