3905520,5,B002CAOE2Q,I am so pleased with my order. It arrived in two days. Very prompt service.,1276473600,,75,4.066666666666666
3905521,5,B002CAOE2Q,"When I bought this set, I already had seen all the episodes for free.  But the show was so good, I had to support the actors and production crew by buying the set because it was just that good.  It arrived quicker than expected, and Amazon must have even been having a sale, because it was for a great price, alot cheaper than if I had bought them at Wal-mart or Best Buy.  All in all, a great shopping experience with Amazon as usual.",1274054400,,435,4.154761904761905
3905522,5,B002CAOE2Q,Not too happy with the post office but the seller was very responsive and I received the order faster than expected and in excellent condition.,1269043200,,143,4.76
3905523,5,B002CAOE2Q,This collection has the best of everything.  The actors are great and the plot is suspenseful.  You'll finish one episode and have to watch the next to see what happens.,1267833600,4,169,4.6
3905524,5,B002CAOE2Q,"I am very very satisfied with this series, and its so nice to watch it without the commercials.",1266451200,,95,4.333333333333333
3905525,4,B002CAOE2Q,"My wife and I got hooked on Smallville recently when her daughter loaned her own set of season one dvds.  They occasionally had a ""Smallville"" night and would sing along on the opening music, ""save me...lalalala"" Hilarious.
We decided we needed our own set and searched online to find a good price.  It is difficult to assess quality for online products, but several sites offered competitive prices (there were also some very high priced sites) and good user reviews.  Shipping took nearly 2 weeks; I was suprised since most items I buy arrive amazingly fast these days.  Apparently this shippment was on ""a slow boat from the east coast through snow storms."" In fairness, I think myself and other consumers have become spoiled by today's lightening fast shipping from the highly efficient online shopping sites. I am old enough to remember the days of ""allow 6 to 8 weeks for processing and shipping.""

The shipment did arrive in good condition.  The seasons are packaged in separate cardboard boxes with various stacked or folding plastic reinforced dvd holders that slide into the outer holder/sleeve. The quality is just fine and looks great on my 47 inch Samsung TV with attached home theater dvd/vhs system in our media room. And yes...I am tempted to sing along too at the opening.",1265328000,7,1289,4.889908256880734
3905526,5,B002CAOE2Q,"I ordered the complete 8 year DVD collection of the Smallville series as a Christmas gift, thought it would be the perfect gift and it was, he loved it and thanked me numerous times for it! Couldn't have chosen a better gift, great job!",1265155200,5,236,4.386363636363637

8363784,1,B002CAOE2Q,"Do not buy expecting this to be individual seasons, seriously this came in some collectors edition I had never seen or heard of and it was totally unorganized, this pic is completely false advertising
do not buy from this seller",1429488000,2,228,4.725
8363785,5,B002CAOE2Q,This set was absolutely amazing. I got the set used and it was in excellent condition. No problems at all with playing the discs. It came quickly.,1412812800,,146,4.444444444444445
8363786,1,B002CAOE2Q,"Am I missing something that the other reviewers (with high ratings) didn't notice?  Under this package, the average cost for each season's programs is $54 !!!!!  Unless you are addicted to box sets, they are much cheaper -- generally $20 or less -- bought individually, and the discs/holders are apparently better in that form.  They are what I intend to buy.  Besides, the last 5 sets or so of the full complement of seasons are available in Blu-Ray (which I prefer) as well as DVD.",1405468800,2,483,4.647058823529412
8363787,1,B002CAOE2Q,"Please if you buy, watch this quickly. The set I bought had several discs that stuck, one disc didn't even work. When I got to season 8 well, it seems to have been recorded from t.v. complete with the station logo and the pop-ups that show on t.v. I wrote the seller and they replied that it had been too long to do anything about it. So if you buy, please watch quickly!!!!!!",1366070400,4,376,4.164383561643835
