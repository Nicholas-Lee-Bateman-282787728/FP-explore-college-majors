7975774,5,B00007G1T1,"I started getting my daughter in Hello Kitty via Youtube to see if she would like it since we don't cable/ Dish/ Netflix to watch things at the moment. This DVD is filled with mini stories of Kitty and Mimi (her twin sister) White experiences and in between episodes is little games such as what animal is it as they reveal a corner with an additional hint, mixing colors, and what is the object.

This is a very cute movie with great stories and life lessons sprinkled throughout and would highly recommend to anyone into the Sanrio universe.",1359331200,,543,4.540816326530612
7975775,3,B00007G1T1,"Hello Kitty's Paradise: Fun With Friends is the second volume of DVDs released for Hello Kitty's Paradise.  The back of the box claims there are eight complete episodes included.  However, the box doesn't explicitly state that the episodes are roughly ten to eleven minutes in length; two ""episodes"" actually make up one whole episode of Hello Kitty's Paradise.  In between the stories, and sometimes at the beginning or at the end of the show, there is a ""Fun and Games"" section using claymation, and the games include such things as ""Guess the Shape,"" ""Animals! Animals!"" and ""Kitty's Caterpillar Quiz.""

The episodes included on this disc are: ""The Magic Bags,"" ""The Dust Monster,"" ""Put On a Happy Place,"" ""The Train to Grandma's House,"" ""Paper Play,"" ""Sizing Things Up,"" ""The Broken Robot,"" and ""What's in Store"" (which is mislabeled on the back of the box as ""What's in the Store"").  The episodes either encourage children to use their imaginations or work to teach kids important lessons about life.  Lessons included on this disc are sharing, counting, safety, manners, and making new friends.  As a parent, I appreciated that the English dub versions of the stories included on the DVD provided positive messages for their intended audience.  I also appreciate that the English dubs of the actual stories were written in a way that the episodes didn't talk down to the audience.

Admittedly, this is a ""low frills"" DVD release.  The main menu has options for Scene Selection and DVD Credits.  The DVD Credits is a screen which shows who worked on this Hello Kitty DVD release.

The Hello Kitty's Paradise DVD releases contain anime that's very friendly to young children.  However, girls will probably be more interested in these DVDs than boys, due to the ""cuteness"" of Hello Kitty.  If you have a young child at home and are looking for kid-friendly anime, then I would recommend the Hello Kitty's Paradise DVDs.",1252368000,,1922,4.965625
