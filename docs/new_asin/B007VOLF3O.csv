5111571,3,B007VOLF3O,The first season was GREAT . the second season just seemed to lack direction . I loved the fact it was photographed in Jerusalem,1385424000,,128,4.375
5111572,5,B007VOLF3O,"LOVE this series!  If you're a frequent visitor to Israel as we are, and especially if you love visiting Jerusalem, you'll love this series about 30-ish singles of the modern Orthodox persuasion trying to live their lives and establish careers in a culture that's all about getting married. In a way, it's reminiscent of Friends but not really a comedy.  BTW, you don't have to be 30 to enjoy this; I'm much closer to 60.  Don't worry--there are English subtitles.  Be aware that these dvds come in the PAL format.",1377043200,,514,4.677777777777778
5111573,5,B007VOLF3O,"This series has been amazing!  Each character has been fleshed out and brought to life by the incredible cast. Although the stories depict the lives of Jewish observant Israeli singles, anyone could relate to and be drawn in by the universal themes of human behavior and personal struggles. I will miss it so much!!",1373673600,2,315,4.833333333333333
5111574,5,B007VOLF3O,"I'm in the middle of Season 3 and I'm dreading the moment when it ends.  Some remarkable acting; poignant, funny scenes; characters whose lives one deeply cares about.  A fascinating look at both the sublime beauty and the absurd limitations of living a religious life in contemporary Jerusalem.  Brilliantly conceived and directed, it's at the top of my list along with such masterpieces as I Claudius, The Sopranos, and Downton Abbey.",1368144000,,436,5.112676056338028
5111575,5,B007VOLF3O,"I really enjoy the character development in Srugim. It gives insight into the
Modern Orthodox community in Israel and how it interfaces with the secular society.
It humanizes the people and raises significant issues for those who live a
conscious Jewish lifestyle.",1362528000,4,264,5.309523809523809
5111576,5,B007VOLF3O,... but it turned out to be perfect. I have enjoyed every episode already and look forward to a second go around soon. Thank you!,1362441600,,129,4.2
5111577,5,B007VOLF3O,"I love all of it-- the characters, the story lines, Jerusalem, and all Jewish content. I highly recommend this series.",1359072000,,118,4.95
5111578,5,B007VOLF3O,"This series is both enjoyable and thought-provoking, particularly for those familiar with the intricacies of Israeli life. The characters are very appealing, but real in their struggles and flaws. We watched all 3 seasons and were sorry when the series ended. We miss them!",1356307200,8,273,5.2272727272727275
5111579,5,B007VOLF3O,i was worried at first because it did not work on the dvd player hooked up to the television.  But it works fine on the computer.,1352764800,4,129,3.9615384615384617
8522249,5,B007VOLF3O,"The series has an interesting storyline which I found quite addictive. I watched mostly with English subtitles, but was able to rewatch some episodes without after a while. It was quite helpful for picking up some common Hebrew words and phrases. The DVDs came in good shape and I was able to watch them with my laptop and my DVD player in New York, USA.",1484784000,,354,4.461538461538462
8522250,5,B007VOLF3O,"thank you very much
i received season 3 and the subtitles are there",1476748800,,67,4.230769230769231
8522251,5,B007VOLF3O,"I was able to play these DVDs on my regular DVD player, I'm in TX, so I don't think the regions matter.
Stories revolved around 5 Jewish singles. I found intresting how Jewish people view life and celebrate Shabbat. It's a clean and fun series to watch. Plus you can learn some Hebrew on the way too. I have English captions on all the time. Shalom! :))",1468713600,3,353,4.2835820895522385
8522252,4,B007VOLF3O,Loved it!,1440806400,,9,4.0
8522253,5,B007VOLF3O,Good Price... Fast Shipping.,1424476800,,28,6.25
8522254,5,B007VOLF3O,This Israel TV series is a marvellous set of stories involving modern Orthodox singles living in Jerusalem.  The series is engrossing and the three seasons don't seem to be enough.,1416182400,,180,5.0
8522255,5,B007VOLF3O,What a great show!  And a wonderful peek into a slice of modern orthodox Jerusalem life.  Too bad there were only three seasons.,1408924800,,128,4.521739130434782
8522256,5,B007VOLF3O,The DVDs are completely new and provide an opportunity to look into the life of conservative Jews living in Israel.,1403136000,,115,4.8
8522257,5,B007VOLF3O,"I should've left this as seller feedback (which I am rectifying now) since the series itself I enjoyed immensely (I've edited my review to reflect this, giving the show 5 stars). The seller just did not do a good job with packaging. Packaging: Poorly done in just an envelope. For a boxed set of dvds (3 seasons), it should have been padded more. Since it took so long to arrive (out of country), I did not bother to send back. The outer cardboard box holding the set was crushed, the plastic DVD cases were cracked in some areas and the inner teeth at center which holds the DVDs in place were broken (on 3 of the 6 dvd cases) so the DVDs were loose and scratched. So far, nothing has skipped but I only watched the 3rd season (saw the first two before). This is a great TV series so I am glad to have the set.",1401926400,,811,4.171974522292993
8522258,5,B007VOLF3O,"And intelligence series, with believable and very human characters, who develop as people much more so than in other television dramas. The character struggle with moral and ethical issues, not always with predictable results.  The show demonstrates that you don't need sex or violence to attract interest.  I watch very little television; I would watch more if it had this quality.",1389225600,,382,5.245901639344262
