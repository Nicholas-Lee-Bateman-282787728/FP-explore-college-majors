8213860,5,B000UMIV36,"This DVD is a great one for little ones.  All of my grandchildren have loved this and have learned many of the songs.  The children sing on camera in a variety of settings.  No animated figures or fast action, just a simple way to encourage love of these songs and as my 2 year old grandson says ""they're singing about Jesus"".
