8388155,5,B003405MDS,I paid $70 for 35 DVDs. My kids love the beautiful video + stories on them. The package is in good quality condition.,1335398400,,117,4.130434782608695
8388156,5,B003405MDS,"These DVDs were recommended to us for our special needs child by his occupational therapist. He is non-verbal, and not able to hold a book but he loves these DVDs of classic stories. He becomes fatigued easily but can rest quietly and be entertained by these great DVDs. I would think they would be wonderful for any young child.",1284768000,2,329,4.593220338983051
8388157,5,B003405MDS,"We have long been fans of the Scholastic Storybook DVDs and purchased a set of six of them when my niece was 3. She has loved them since that time, but now that she's almost a reader (5.5 yo), she loves them even more. She particularly enjoys seeing stories that we've read together at bedtime.

This collection of 35 DVDs included the six we already owned, but we're giving the newer ones away as gifts to other families so they're not being wasted. The 35 DVDs work out to about $3 per DVD, well worth the price. We give them to my niece at a rate of about one new one per week so they should last almost a year by the time she's seen them all.

The only complaint I have is that there are some duplicates of stories on the DVDs as the ""collections"" have some overlap. And some of the stories we'd like most aren't included, especially ones involving princesses. But that's a minor difficulty given how much our young one and her friends enjoy watching them.",1283126400,,960,4.3277777777777775
