878560,4,6304411413,"OK, you've got George Maharis of ""Route 66,"" Richard Basehart and Richard Bull from ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,"" ""Honey West's"" own Anne Francis, Frank Sutton (""Sgt. Carter"" of ""Gomer Pyle""), Hari Rhodes of ""Daktari"", and in if one looks fast, ""Star Trek's"" James Doohan (""Scotty"") in a bit part. Rounding out the actors are such television stalwarts as Henry Beckman, Harold Gould, John Larkin, John Anderson, Simon Oakland (later to be featured in the 70's ""Night Stalker""), and Ed Asner in a pre-Lou Grant role. 40's movie star Dana Andrews is a part of the on-screen happenings.

878679,5,6304411413,"I have the Blue Ray version of  The Satan Bug. I really enjoyed it as a kid way back in the 60s. The story is about the theft of a deadly microbe which if released could devastate Los Angeles.
A top agent is sent in to solve the situation.
That is it in a nut shell. How ever this film is good stuff and the cast is worth seeing in action. Anne Francis is the female lead and is beautiful. Dana Andrews of Laura fame is here as the director of operations. Richard Basehart of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea turns in a wonderful performance. Others are Ed Asner, Simon Oakland and John Anderson. Produced and directed by John Sturges. Music by Jerry Goldsmith and written by James Clavell. The cast and crew are some of the top in their fields and to have them together in one film is the top of entertainment.
The commentary with the film is very good also. Good rainy day entertainment. Espionage fans of the 60s will want to own this.",1485129600,,937,4.23463687150838
878680,5,6304411413,"This movie is one of my all time favorites from the 60's era. Especially the music. I've already purchased previous editions with varying degrees of satisfaction including the MGM Limited Collection DVD which is an on demand based duplication. Not sure how robust that recording is. However this Blu-ray recording from Kino Lorber is way better than all the previous standard DVD editions.  They really did a great job!  And this is a standard production run (not on demand) so I feel pretty confident that the recording medium is robust enough to last.  You get the original theatrical trailer (that's almost always a given now days, but still a plus) and audio commentary by film historian Glenn Erickson. It's not like having commentary from the director, however, it's more like getting to watch one of your favorite movies with another film fan who knows a lot about the movie and its era. Definitely a plus!  I will note that during the commentary the soundtrack audio is somewhat too low. But it's a really minor quibble.  Bottom line: this is a really great version of a terrific film from the 60's.  If you're a fan of the Satan Bug you'll definitely want to add this version to your library.",1478908800,,1201,4.75
878681,3,6304411413,"Believe it or not, I do more than a fair share of reading about Science Fiction films.  This isn't meant to say that Im bookish on the subject; rather it clarifies that Im always checking out flicks and SciFi-related series in my efforts to continue to grow SciFiHistory. Nets own data citations.  When a title catches my interest, Ill bookmark it so that I can return to it when I have more time.  And when a title keeps popping up in my reading, Ill scour the cable listings to see if its subject to some near-future airing so that I can see personally just what all the fuss is about.

I cant begin to tell you the number of times The Satan Bug (1965) has appeared on my radar.  Honestly, it seems like every week for the last year I stumbled across it in scouring IMDB.coms biographies.  A Blu-ray version even streeted of it a year back in 2015 (I think that may be the first time the United Artist release caught my interest), so you can imagine my delight when it finally dropped onto Turner Classic Movies schedule.  I finally watched it the other night, and I wanted to sound off on it briefly.

Basically, Bug is a biological warfare thriller kinda/sorta in the same vein of The Andromeda Strain, which would be released by Universal Pictures six years later.  The difference between the two of these closely-related films is that Andromedas man-killer comes from space while Satans bug (as it were) is entirely man-made.  Heres the (edited) plot summary as provided by Amazon.com:

The Message is clear: put an end to war research... or prepare for the end of the Earth. Officials have no doubt about the madman s ability to carry out his threat; they know he has access to The Satan Bug. George Maharis, Dana Andrews and Anne Frances face the terror of a death germ in this race-against-time thriller directed by the great John Sturges. The Suspense begins at a top-secret U.S. germ warfare laboratory when containers of lethal microbe are stolen and soon after the group behind the theft proves its deadly resolve by using the weapon to completely annihilate the residents of a small town Florida community. The next target: Los Angeles... unless government agent Maharis and an elite task force can somehow prevent the City of Angels from becoming Hell on Earth.

Honestly, The Satan Bug isn't a bad film.

The capable Maharis is introduced late in the films set-up, and the script fashions him rather easily into what I suspect was intended to be a thinking mans James Bond.  However, rather than show us just how good he is, the audience is informed of his exploits, and this necessarily removes some of the visual excitement that accompanies the standard Bond picture.  Otherwise, everyone else in the film is rather flat and non-descript; even the normally plucky Anne Frances delivers her dialogue with somewhat surprising seriousness, even when flirting with Maharis.  No one injects his or her character with much  well  character.

Perhaps Bugs greatest sequence is when the cast is being treated to the videotaped aftermath of the first terrorist attack, that on the unsuspecting Floridians.  A plane flies over a state highway lightly filled with stopped automobiles and dead people lying about the road; the virus killed them not quite instantly (as evidenced by the fact that they could get out of their vehicles), but the graveyard is captured in almost documentary fashion, leaving the cinema audience of its day to feel a sense of rising dread over what science has wrought.  No words are required, and the sequence plays out long enough to make its point: this is serious stuff, and mankind ought to be alarmed.

Also, Bug fashions a pretty spiffy underground laboratory where scientists work to understand the science of biological warfare.  Granted, it isn't as high-tech looking as what eventually makes the aforementioned Andromeda Strain so memorable, but the production staffers should be commended for a job well done.

Lastly, Bug certainly deals with an interesting subject matter  the probable end of life as we know it by our own construction  and so far as stories go this one has an obvious beginning, middle, and end with plenty of modest developments sprinkled along the way.  I think my issues with the film is that despite the premise of a world-destroying-virus-on-the-brink-of-being-released theres just so little suspense delivered in the leaden performances of all involved (far too much seriousness and everyone seems like a cinema character instead of folks wrapped up in jeopardy).  Its good, but its no owner as todays consumers might attest.

Think of this Bug as likely good for a single viewing but with practically zero re-watch quality.",1478563200,,4696,4.8865069356872635

Cool anti-establishment spy guy hero who walked away from it all, hot blonde Anne Francis in her heyday, lush country clubs, cool cars and a shadowy govt agency run by a distinguisher white haired man known only as ""The General"".

Great story of biowarfare agents gone wrong and the risk to mankind. This film was released in 1965 and the BluRay DVD restores the color and sound to original quality - it pops off the screen.

878788,3,6304411413,"BOTTOM LINE: I'd never seen the film prior to this Blu-ray purchase. It's not the best spy thriller I've ever watched, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. It looks & sounds really nice on this Blu-ray presentation. An excellent job in bringing yet another obscure older film to light. Thanks, Kino-Lorber. I give THE SATAN BUG a respectable 3 STARS

THE STORY: In a top secret, desert-based U.S. government research facility, the world's most virulent biological weapons are being synthesized. One such killer bacteria, dubbed the ""Satan Bug"" by its creators, is so deadly that just a few drops in our atmosphere would wipe out all life on Earth within days. When terrorist spies ingeniously penetrate the supposedly impregnable high security compound and steal several beakers full of death-laden supergerms, (the dreaded Satan Bug among them), it's up to a small team of federal operatives to retrieve the uber-leathal bio-weapons at any cost... before the suicidal terrorists release the microscopic killers and extinguish all life on our planet.

THOUGHTS: An intriguing espionage thriller with slight 007 overtones, oddly blended with more traditional procedural crime drama trappings, THE SATAN BUG makes for a curious & unnerving motion picture experience. The film takes its time setting things up and surprisingly does NOT fill in all the blanks immediately. Director John Sturges (Magnificent Seven, The Great Escape, Ice Station Zebra, etc., etc.) actually expects his viewers to do a bit of thinking for themselves in order to piece the clues together. Moments of genuine tension develop when it becomes frighteningly apparent that these terrorists don't particularly care whether or not they destroy themselves along with the rest of the world. Nice American southwestern desert location photography helps offset the claustrophobically confining underground secret lab sets. Interesting cast of unknowns & many soon-to-be TV stars, awkwardly lead by the disappointing (IMHO) choice of stiff-as-a-mannequin George Maharis, as our James Bond-ian hero. Sturdy John Stuges directs with a tried & steady hand on the proceedings but one wishes it was a little more exciting. Certainly the subject matter would have lent itself to a lot more high-drama & action if it had a slightly better, punchier script. Still, it is a decent little thriller, with a very scary core concept. It practically begs to be re-made, given today's dysfunctionally dystopian, terrorist-filled world climate. Then again, this movie isn't far removed from so much of what's wrong with our current global society, so maybe a remake isn't such a hot idea after all.

THE BLU-RAY: 1965's THE SATAN BUG arrives in pristine-looking & sounding condition thanks to this beautiful new hi-def Blu-ray transfer from Kino-Lorber. Picture is razor-sharp for the most part and the bright, vivid color scheme is nicely represented. Little to no artifacting or pixelation. Sound mix is level & clear and mostly free of the crackles, hissing and pops that often plague older films or those whose source materials were in rough condition.

878796,5,6304411413,"Just finished watching ""The Satan Bug"" released by MGM Studios.
Based on the novel by Ian Stuart, which was a pen name used by Alistair MacLean; ""The Satan Bug"" was one of the earliest films; and novels, to honestly examine the devastating effects bio-weapons can have on a population.
In a secret military laboratory in the desert, the deadliest bio-weapon has been created, and there is no apparent cure.  Despite all the security in the lab, the deadly biological weapon is stolen; and the former head of security for the lab is recruited to determine what happened and to find the missing bio-weapon.
""The Satan Bug"" does rather eerily show what can happen when a deadly virus is released into a population.
Who stole the ""Satan Bug'?  Spoiler ahead:  An un-named terrorist makes demands that all war research efforts must be suspended, otherwise the deadly plague will be released to wipe out all of humanity.
The motive of the terrorist, though firmly placed in the growing anti-war sentiment of the 1960s, is a compelling one and he is one firmly committed fanatic to his own self-determined cause.  And if he goes down, he's willing to take all of humanity with him.
A Great, Taunt Thriller that keeps you glued to the screen and on the edge of your seat!

The setting in the movie was moved to the desert of the southwest from England.  The ultimate motive for the crime was modified also.  What remains intact is a neatly and tightly plotted story of national extortion.  Will the former agent, with a talent for insubordination, be able to out think a criminal mastermind.  The cast is full of stars and veteran character actors.  George Maharis, of Route 66 fame, is our hero.  Anne Francis, a beauty of the time, is the love interest.  Look for a younger Ed Asner as a heavy of course.  Frank Sutton, of Gomer Pyle fame, is almost unrecognizable without a USMC uniform on.  James Doohan is a government agent, looking much slimmer than his Star Trek days.  The story comes from the mind of the man who gave us The Guns of Navarone or Where Eagles Dare so expect twist, turns and action.",1437955200,2,1012,4.58659217877095

Based loosely on one of Alistair Maclean's lesser spy novels, the movie concerns a deadly virus stolen from a top-secret U.S. government laboratory hidden away in the desert. Maharis is smart and brave and Francis is very pretty. What else do you want? The picture quality is only so-so, but no worse than watching any old film on late-night television.

When the action does finally pick up, the desert setting is utilized fairly well, as matters build to a mildly exciting finish.

Station 3, is a government facility located in the southern California desert, involved in the development of bioweapons.  After a security breech, Lee Barrett (George Maharis) a former government agent, is brought to investigate.  In what is suspected to be an inside job, the director of the facility is found dead, and it is discovered that samples of a deadly virus called the Satan Bug, are missing.  It's a critical situation, but the authorities have few leads, until Barrett and his colleague Ann (Anne Francis), get on the trail of the stolen virus.  With Los Angeles threatened with destruction, Barrett and the authorities, struggle to stop the terrorist's scheme.

The movie greatly reworks MacLean's original story, in which London was threatened with destruction.  Sturges does what he can with the screenplay, and the movie does have a few exciting moments, but it lacks the edginess of MacLean's novel, and the wide open desert setting, isn't exactly ideal for surreptitious activity.  George Maharis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Route-66/dp/B001675ZI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Route 66</a>) makes a fairly competent protagonist, and Edward Asner is quite menacing as one of the terrorists.  Richard Basehart (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Voyage-to-the-Bottom-of-the-Sea/dp/B000BZISS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea</a>)plays things a tad too dramatic, but he does provide a spark, in an adventure in dire need of some energy.  Jerry Goldsmith's musical score, also helps in that regard.

If you're into 60's suspense adventures, or a fan of Alistair MacLean's novels, you may appreciate this rather slow developing adventure.  Those who prefer modern fast paced action movies, probably won't be very impressed by The Satan Bug, with its slow build up and lackluster finish.",1369699200,3,2947,6.908355795148248

879098,4,6304411413,"In the remote desert of California, a helicopter lands at Station 3, a top secret underground military microbiological research facility, disgorging Reagan, the chief of lab security, back from a trip to Washington, D.C.. His attempt to get right back to his usual end of the day (he got in late) schedule and oversee the delivery of some crates of lab equipment, gets interrupted when one of the scientists, Dr. Ostrer, nervously tells him they need to talk. Reagan is all ears, but an uneasy Ostrer tells him to come by his house in the morning.

After finishing with the crates and seeing to it that they're taken inside, Reagan goes to see the lab's director, Dr. Baxter, to converse with him about his trip to D.C. It seems the US Army bean counters who fund Station 3 are worried about the facility's latest masterwork, which at this time sits before Baxter inside of an airtight Erlenmeyer flask. Whatever it is, it's got a lot of people scared. Reagan leaves and goes topside. Another scientist, Dr. Gregor Hoffman, pops in briefly to discuss the contents of the flask with Baxter before departing himself. No sooner has he left than a thuggish-looking man enters and begins walking purposefully towards the unprepared Dr. Baxter.

Sometime later, Dr. Baxter has left, but something about his manner seems off to Reagan, who goes below. He's gone for hours. The security guards get worried and try phoning him, but receive no reply.

Elsewhere, a man carrying a briefcase goes aboard the yacht of Lee Barrett, a former military man turned lawyer, with an interesting proposition for him. He introduces himself to Barrett as Henry Martin from the Council for World Peace, an antiwar organization. From his briefcase, he produces an Erlenmeyer flask containing a vaccine which he claims was stolen from Station 3. He's willing to pay Barrett several thousands of dollars to ferry the flask and its contents to Europe, so that certain foreign powers can have a defense against the biological weapons America is developing.

Barrett, himself highly anti-authoritarian and with no taste for war, likes this idea, but there's one problem... he knows Henry Martin, and the man currently aboard his boat ain't Henry Martin. He also knows that the contents of the flask are a virus, not a vaccine. He pulls a gun on the fake Martin. Antiwar though he may be, he isn't about to even the odds of the Cold War that way! Enter Eric Cavanaugh and another man. Cavanaugh is the chief of the SDI (some sort of internal security division), and his friend is Dr. Leonard Michaelson, a scientist from Station 3. They reveal the flask contains no virus, ""Martin"" is in fact an SDI agent, and this entire setup has been a test of Barret's loyalties. Barrett is understandably pissed, but softens a bit when he hears the news; his old friend Reagan is dead.

They want Barrett, who was Reagan's predecessor as chief of security before his displeasure with the kinds of experiments being done there got him fired, to head up an investigation into the murder, and wanted to test his loyalties. After some grumbling, Barrett agrees, and flies by helicopter with Cavanaugh and Michaelson to the facility. They head underground and find Reagan dead outside the electronically-maglocked vault containing the main lab. He's been beaten to death. Dr. Hoffman, the guy we saw talking to Dr. Baxter earlier, is leery about them entering the vault to see if anything's been taken, for fear that one of the viruses may have been let loose in the process of the theft. Barrett overrides his concerns and enters wearing a hazmat suit, to find Dr. Baxter, dead from exposure to a deadly virus called botulinus. How can this be? Baxter was reported leaving!

The air vent system clears out the botulinus, allowing the others to enter. Dr. Hoffman stampedes worriedly to the locked cabinet containing Station 3's deadliest cache of viruses, to find that they're all gone. Several flasks of botulinus, as well as one flask containing a lab-engineered experimental variant of polio, the same flask Baxter was fretting about earlier. It's codenamed ""Satan Bug,"" and if released could wipe out all life on Earth in two months. And now it's the hands of someone or some ones, who intend to do God knows what with it!

Barrett quickly deduces that the thieves cut their way out through the wire fence, presumably with the stolen viruses in a carrying case which is also missing. But he can't account for how they got in, or how Baxter could be seen leaving only to turn up dead in the maglocked vault the next day. One of the guards mentions he overheard Dr. Ostrer talking to Reagan before he left, telling him they needed to talk, so Barrett drives to Ostrer's house... only to find the scientist floating face down in his swimming pool. Suddenly, the phone rings. Answering it and pretending he's a repairman, Barrett learns the caller is trying to reach a Mr. Charles Ainsley, before hanging up. The mystery deepens.

Eventually, Barrett tries to learn who Ainsley is, only to learn that Mr. Ainsley, a powerful millionaire from New York, isn't the type of person one asks questions about. He is, however, the guy with just the right connections and clout to pull off a daring heist like this one. Barrett goes to see his former friend in the SDI, Cavanaugh's superior General Williams, and learns he's been contacted by the thieves, who are threatening to unleash the deadly viruses (the botulinus only; they're holding back on the killer Satan Bug) if their demands aren't met. Dubbing Station 3 ""the home of the Anti-Christ,"" their telegram demands its total closure, or they'll unleash the botulinus in a yet-to-be-determined location. It's a race to solve the mystery of how the crooks broke into Station 3 and track down Ainsley and the viruses before he can use them, especially the Satan Bug. But will Barrett and the SDI get there in time...?

The Satan Bug is a 1965 sci-fi/mystery thriller directed by John Sturges, who also directed such classic films as The Great Escape, and it's based off of a novel by Alistair MacLean, who had then recently given the world the WWII thriller The Guns of Navarone (although MacLean wrote Satan Bug under the pseudonym ""Ian Stuart,"" and he's credited as such in Satan Bug's credits). Add to this the fact the movie features an early score by famed composure Jerry Goldsmith, and The Satan Bug has an impressive pedigree - behind the camera, anyway.

In front of the camera is a different story. First and foremost, there's the total change in setting. Although the movie is, beat for beat, a fairly accurate retelling of MacLean's novel, the book was set in England. There wasn't really much reason beyond budgetary constraints to relocate the story's setting to America and make all of the character's American. They also changed (i.e. simplified) the villain's plan. In the novel, his threat to unleash the viruses unless the lab is closed is just a smokescreen so he can achieve something completely different behind the good guys' backs, a la Simon in Die Hard with a Vengeance. That said, despite the relocation to America, I rather slightly prefer the film to the novel.

The cast is good, but with the exception of Richard Basehart as Dr. Hoffman, there aren't too many familiar faces in prominent roles. I will say, though, I liked George Maharis as Barrett. In terms of the supporting cast, look for James Doohan (Scotty from Star Trek) as an SDI agent who shows up in a few brief scenes, and Ed Asner as henchman Veretti.

Definitely worth checking out. A good, suspenseful, twisty-turny movie with a fun if slightly silly climax.",1360281600,2,7655,4.826219512195122

Novelist Alistair Maclean who would have his works graced all over the big screen throughout the late sixties into the mid seventies has his work morphed into a talky, soapy foray in Director John Sturges's 'THE SATAN BUG'-1965, a part Sci-Fi part conspiracy theory excursion which should have emerged as an intense experience.  It has a great icing on the cake music score by Jerry Goldsmith and great panoramic photography by Robert Surtees and a great supporting cast but is let down by a poor performance by George Maharis straight out of his stint from TV's 'ROUTE 66'.  Richard Basehart, who would go on to star in TV's 'VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA' in a few years, plays the schizo who steals a virus from a top security research station and has the US in his grip by holding it for ransom to stop germ warfare from being experimented on.  Maharis is the agent assigned to bring him down aided by Dana Andrews who would play a role similar to Basehart's in the same years 'CRACK IN THE WORLD' and Anne Francis who unfortunately doesn't do much.  Director Sturges, fresh off his war time hit 'THE GREAT ESCAPE'-1963 tries to bring life to the set pieces but is laden by gabby dialogue supplied by Screenwriters James Clavell and Edward Anhalt. It is ,however, fun spotting many familiar genre faces along the way and I won't spoil it by telling you who.  MGM releases it in a beautiful DVD-R 2.35 transfer.

879176,5,6304411413,"The rating is for the movie, which I really like a lot.

The disk is a DVD-R based on whatever they had available. It does have defects, but they all appeared to me to be from the underlying film. Of course, I watched it in NTSC using component video. An HDTV might show problems, depending on how it displays DVDs.

I watch a film in a local theater most Fridays. I go to the first show. I often see a film on the day of release. The prints of those films, presumably being shown for the first time, often show defects of the same sort on this DVD-R. And if they aren't prints but are digital files, well, that doesn't really make things any better, does it? Those wishing to duplicate the experience of watching the film in a theater should keep in mind that films shown in theaters are rarely perfect.

The DVD-R programs presumably started as a way to get films out on DVD that did not have enough popularity for a full-scale DVD release, but for which there were nonetheless people who desperately wanted to see them again. Since at least one of these catalogues now has over 1000 items, the programs presumably continue because they make money for the studio. They do this by expending minimal resources up front on the source materials and charging higher per-disc amounts for the presumably labor-intensive disc-by-disc burning.

Complaining about quality is pointless (unless the disc was not burned correctly, in which case a replacement, in my experience, will work fine). Those waiting for a full-scale DVD release may be waiting a long, long time: much of the market for such an edition will have bought the DVD-R.

The audience for DVD-Rs is comprised of people who want to watch the movie, not people who have other interests. If you want to watch the movie, buy the disc (if your player can play DVD-Rs; if you aren't sure, check your manual, because some older players can not). If you have other priorities, don't buy it, because all it offers is the movie (and sometimes the trailer): no fancy menus, no special features, no commentaries, no extras, no audio or subtitle options. If the film was in mono, the disc will be in mono: no fancy remixes.

The main advantage over the VHS tape may well be that the DVD-R is in the correct aspect ratio, CD-quality audio, and, when the VHS tape botched the colors, gets the colors right.

For films that were never on VHS tape, the main advantage of the DVD-R is simply that it exists.",1330819200,3,2446,4.570776255707763

879179,4,6304411413,"An Americanized adaptation of an early Alistair Maclean thriller, this 1960s film made quite an impression on the few who saw it at the time. It was one of the first films to deal with the horrific threat of biological warfare, and it offered the underrated George Maharis as a spy who uses his brain as much (or more) as his muscles. Supported by a fine cast of solid (if unspectacular) actors, Maharis works his way through a tangled web of misdirection to discover who has stolen the deadly Satan Bug -- and more to the point, why. If it's a little sluggish in parts, that still doesn't detract from the creepier portion of the story, which allows the viewer to contemplate the apocalyptic results of unleashing such weapons on the world.

It's a treat to see actors like Ed Asner & Frank Sutton before their big sitcom success -- Sutton is especially good as a leering thug. And of course there's the luminous presence of Anne Francis, whose rapport with Maharis was previously demonstrated in a classic episode of ""Route 66"" -- the actors genuinely liked each other, and it shows. It's just a pity her role is so underwritten, and she never really gets a chance to show what she could do with the character.

True, it has something of the quality of a made-for-TV movie -- but a good one, I hasten to add. Modern audiences may find it a bit slow, as it's more of a police procedural than an all-out action film. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Adjust for the difference in filmmaking & you may well find yourself engrossed before you know it.

So -- not a lost masterpiece, but still an entertaining film that leaves the viewer with something troubling to think about afterwards. Remember, there's no reason to believe that work on biological weapons hasn't advanced in the decades since the film came out -- and that's a chilling thought!

Please note that the negative reviews here are for the print, not the film itself, which really deserves a higher overall rating than the one it's got.

I always liked George Maharis and his dead pan, no-nonsense style is well suited as the hero and main character of the film. SATAN BUG is a solid, engrossing and suspenseful film. This is good film-making all around right down to the performances, the script, cinematography and Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score. Still waiting for the DVD!",1271030400,2,439,5.111111111111111

879241,3,6304411413,"The Satan Bug is an uncharacteristic Alistair Maclean movie in that ,unlike his biggest box office pictures, it is not a  straightforward slice of heroics but a more nuanced espionage slanted movie with some moral ambivalence to it .It seems Maclean reciognised this too for he authored the book pseudonymously -as Ian Stuart.

The Satan Bug is a deadly virus developed by the US government in a secret research facility in the desert. Flasks housing samples of the virus are  stolen and threats issued to unleash the plague on the US .Lee Barrett a government investigator (George Maharis)is called in to lead the investigation .He is aided by Ann(Anne Francis)the daughter of the presiding general in the case (Dana Andrews).Among the suspects is Doctor Hoffman (Richard Basehart)the scientist who has been the prime mover behind the development of the virus

Things move to an airborne climax-a fight on board a helicopter as flasks of the virus roll around loose

The script -by James Clavell and Edward Anhalt is solid and provides meaty roles for the leads and a sound supporting cast which includes Edward Asner and Simon Oakland .Jerry Goldsmith does a great job on the score too

John Sturgess was a great action director but seems a little underpowered here and the movie while solid and very entertaining is a little shy of the absolute top drawer. It is a workmanlike thriller which should please most of its viewers",1195516800,3,1428,4.929166666666666
879242,4,6304411413,"This is a pretty taut little doomsday thriller, detailing the terrorist theft of some nasty biological weapons -- one of which can wipe out all life on Earth (hence, the movie's name).  Good, straight-as-an-arrow performances are augmented by a nicely paced storyline.  You'll see a lot of TV veterans in this flick, and they don't disappoint.

The warehouse scene (with the broken flask) and the helicopter fight are particularly well done.  It's too bad this film hasn't been converted to DVD.

It's always great to see any moment of Anne Francis, the wonderful actress who left us WAY too soon. I would like to see DVDs of the ""Honey West"" series, and I very much would like to see ""The Satan Bug"" on DVD. There's a lot of junk on DVD now; this film certainly is more worthy than most. UPDATE: Oops! How could I confuse Anne Francis with Inger Stevens? Anne is alive, and that's great! She's always been one of my favorites. ANOTHER UPDATE: I just watched my VHS tape from AMC. You must see this in widescreen. AMC never did widescreen, and there are a lot of moments that have noses talking to each other. The scope and thrill of this film was sorely lacking. And Anne Francis rules!  UPDATE: Ms Francis, my beloved favorite, has left us, and I'm saddened more than I should be. My only regret is that I never met her.

7871443,4,6304411413,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of 'The Satan Bug' released by Kino Lorber in September, 2015.

This is an early 'virus' movie. It might be the first of it's type but I'm not sure. Of course this depends on one's opinion on what constitutes a virus/contamination type of movie. 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' could possibly be thrown into this discussion. This is a genre that would produce quite a few good movies over the years. For starters, a few years later, 'The Andromeda Strain' would be released. Other very good virus movies over the years would be made. Some would be post apocalyptic examples, '28 Days Later,' ' 'The Stand,' 'Rise of Planet of the Apes,' 'I am Legend,' etc. (way too many to list) Others would be about trying to stop the virus like this one.

BLU-RAY & EXTRA'S: I thought that the pictures was very nice. The print was clear and sharp and the colors were deep. I can't imagine anybody else producing a nicer picture than this. Of course it's possible but I doubt any improvements would be noticeable to the average person.
There is a pretty good commentary track by film historian Glen Erickson. I listened to about half of it.
You also get the original theatrical trailer.

PLOT/SUMMARY: During the first twenty minutes of the movie we watch as a successful plot to steal two viruses from a top secret laboratory unfolds. One of the viruses lasts about 8 hours but could wipe out a city in that short time. The other virus could potentially wipe out all life on earth (Satan Bug). Shortly thereafter, Barrett (George Maharis) is recruited to help recover the viruses by a person known only as the 'General' (Dana Andrews.) The General's daughter is the 'kind of' love interest, Ann (Anne Francis.) It's not long before they suspect an international criminal called 'Ainsley' is behind the thefts. The short term virus is unleashed in the Florida Keys as a warning and another flash is placed somewhere in Los Angeles. The Satan Bug itself is being used to blackmail the United States.  From here the movie is a thriller/mystery story that focuses on finding out who Ainsley is, what his motivations are and how to find the viruses before they are let loose.

PRODUCTION/THOUGHTS:(Warning****Spoilers**** ahead) I concur with much of what is said in the commentary with regard to the safety measures of the virus. It is almost inconceivable that their wouldn't be different measures taken for a virus that could wipe out all life on earth. You have the top scientist sitting in a room exhausted with the virus in a simple glass flask on the desk. Any slip and that's the end of the world. There would certainly be a sealed anit-contamination chamber(not sure if that's the proper lingo) in between so that the virus couldn't escape if released. Security on the base was sparse at best. With something so dangerous you would expect massive amounts of security....not just a single guard at a desk. The crates certainly would have been checked no matter when they were brought to the base. That is especially true in today's world where paranoia reigns supreme.
I just felt that the movie seemed to show lack of urgency for what was going on. You would imagine every agent on earth would be working on this problem along with constant updates to the President since it could end the world. Instead you basically had a few agents and a General working on it.

Another problem I had with the movie is the ease with which a criminal managed to supplant one of the top scientists in the world. Really?....he was making pretend that he was a world famous scientist and nobody noticed? How in the world would a criminal be able to make pretend he had genius level scientific knowledge. I don't care how much studying he did, that just wouldn't be possible.

I thought there were too many unlikely coincidences. I thought that Ainsley's car breaking down after stealing the viruses was unlikely. Very unlikely would be Barrett figuring out what happened. Incredibly unlikely would be Barrett actually finding the hidden virus in the middle of nowhere.
Barrett being the only person to escape the virus attack in the shed was also very unlikely.....and why would they waste a flask on the three of them. Why not just shoot them or kill them another way.

A lot of people liked George Maharis in the role of a top secret agent. I did not. They were looking for a 007, Sean Connery, type of actor. Maharis has the look but not the voice. I know this is knit picking but I just felt that his voice sounded too effeminate for the role.

If you pay attention you will notice a young James Doohan( 'Scotty' from 'Star Trek'). He has a role as an agent but does not speak.

'The Satan Bug' had a decent sized budget for the times and were able to get some pretty good actors/actresses (Dana Andrews, Anne Francis, George Maharis.) We also get Ed Asner from the 'Mary Tyler Moore Show.'

RECOMMENDATIONS/CONCLUSIONS:  Overall I'm giving this release 4 stars. If you are just interested in the movie then I would give it 3 stars. If you are a fan of the movie then you will want this release because of the very nice picture and director commentary.

I did not particularly think it was a great movie but it was a decent movie. There were some nice sets but some large gaps in logic and some very unlikely plot twists. Nevertheless, it was a well produced and well directed movie that has some entertainment value. It's a pretty good science fiction/mystery film for the time period.",1492905600,,5504,4.667698658410733
