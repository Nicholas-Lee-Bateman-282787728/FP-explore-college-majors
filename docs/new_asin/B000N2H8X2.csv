A misleading package and an amateur effort, and shame on whoever made and is profiting from this DVD.  I wouldn't even have bought it for 5$.",1356480000,,254,4.478260869565218
8174158,1,B000N2H8X2,"I just finished watching the entire, @ 77 minutes, Modern Masters; In The Studio With Michael Golden DVD and I must say that it was NOT worth the money! It does little justice to Golden's fans! I would not recommend this DVD to anyone! Why? 1) Bad quality - PIXELATION - NOT DVD quality! 2) It is mostly an Interview With Michael Golden and NOT what the title implies! 3) It is ONLY 30 Minutes (Main) and 47 Minutes (Extras), which by the way would have been the COOLest segment of the DVD were it not for the PIXELATION and the Double-Speed! a BAD DVD in all respects, production wise!

TwoMorrow Publishing: Come on guys! You could have done much, much better! I had plans to buy the entire line of the Modern Masters DVD series, but after this first purchase, I, unfortunately, will not!

To Michael Golden Fans:

Buy the the book, Modern Masters Volume 12: Michael Golden (Modern Masters (TwoMorrows Publishing)) (Paperback), instead - it is a book I have been waiting since I became a Michael Golden fan, in the early 80's.",1215734400,,1028,4.545945945945946
8174159,1,B000N2H8X2,"I saw this on the store shelf, with a cover showing lots of production pages; since it was called IN THE STUDIO WITH MICHAEL GOLDEN, I expected to see how a comic book artist creates a full package. The packaging promises to take the viewer ""behind the scenes and into his studio, for an exclusive look at this groundbreaking creator as he discusses the processes he undertakes to create his unparalleled artwork!""

Well, what you get is a man sitting in a chair for six chapters, mostly giving opinions, and telling us how little he draws unless he's being paid (he's more of a ""thinker,"" you see.) There is an ""extra"" feature where he draws a character while giving more opinions.

And the quality was poor; pixelation and poor audio. DEFINITELY not worth 29.95. The store was selling it for half price, so I don't feel as bad; there were a few interesting opinions, at least. But this is not in the studio at all.",1212019200,2,916,4.545454545454546
8174160,2,B000N2H8X2,"Whilst what was on the DVD was mildly interesting, I think the makers have a cheek to call it in the studio with Michael Golden. There was no real discussion over his art and methods, and not much in the way of examples of his work. The packaging states that the running time is 90 minutes, The main interview was barely 30 minutes and he spent at least 10 minutes taling about editing comics.
Generally when running time is mentioned you expect that to cover the main feature and not to include all the Bonuses as well. these do not last 60 minutes unless my dvd clock is wrong. The bonus features are indeed of him drawing with some talk overlayed onto double speed photography. Given as the other reviewer has stated the low quality of the picture they could probably have done these in real time. I understand that Mr Golden does not do interviews often which is why I eagerly awaited this item, but he doesn't seem to have participated very fully and perhaps should not have agreed to the dvd if he did not want to be talkative. I was distinctly underwhelmed by it and if this is an indication of the quality of the other titles in the range then I will not be buying anymore and would advise other potential purchasers to approach with caution. If you want to have a better insight into Michael Golden then get the modern Masters book on Golden - which is great value and better serves the publisher and Golden than this DVD does",1192406400,4,1435,4.418867924528302
8174161,2,B000N2H8X2,"I was looking forward to this DVD very much. As a long time fan of Golden's work, this looked like a must have. To be honest, if you appreciate his work as much as I do, it still is.

What did I like about this DVD? Well, it is Golden being Golden. There weren't any really hard hitting discussions, but then, it didn't really need that. Golden explains his approach to work, his reasons for doing things the way he does, and why he feels his system works so well. He didn't sugar coat anything, but he didn't attack anyone either. The opportunities were there, but he took the high ground. This DVD was especially surprising, as Golden once stated he didn't do interviews. That is just about all this DVD is, a long interview. My one opportunity to meet Golden (25 years plus I think) he declined several interviews, but he did speak with the fans. He was open, honest and not afraid to say what he thought. Additionally he let me watch him draw all day, and that was the best art lesson I ever received, really. So, it was nice to see that the extras were him doing just that: drawing and talking.

Sounds great doesn't it? Here's where I tell the rest: The DVD was letterboxed. It seems like that would mean nice picture quality, but it didn't mean that. The resolution on this DVD is appalling. Even the DVD menu is pixilated. This made it very hard to watch as the one pixel thick rims of Golden's glasses were such extreme jaggies I couldn't take my eyes off of them. Additionally, they are shot from angles that seem inspired by the 60s Batman TV series. I guess that is to reinforce this is about comics, but I think anyone wishing to view this would be aware of that. Now we have the previously mentioned extras. Even in this resolution it is nice to see him draw. Well, that is it would be, if the Isuzu cameraman, or maybe it is a survivor from Blair Witch, hadn't shot the video and then played it back at double speed. By the time I had finished the extras I had an enormous headache and my blood pressure felt like it was through the roof. (I'll watch them half speed next time, maybe that will help. I won't hear his commentary, but it wasn't really about what he was drawing.)

It pains me to give it two stars. This should have been so much more fun. Sorry.",1191542400,9,2274,4.308411214953271
