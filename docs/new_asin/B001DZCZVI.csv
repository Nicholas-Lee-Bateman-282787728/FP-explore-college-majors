8295531,3,B001DZCZVI,"This has helped my toddler learn a little bit of swedish but is not as great as it could be. It is basically a slide show with a voice saying in swedish what the picture is of. I only wish they said the phrase in english and in swedish as sometimes it is unclear as to what exactly the swedish phrase means. For example... It shows a picture of a lady reading a book but is really a supposed to be a ""mother"" reading. My son thought the swedish word for ""mother"" referred to all ladies. If it first said ""Mom is reading a book"" and then said the swedish phrase it would be a fabulous learning tool. It also can be confusing when it shows a picture of an apple but gives the swedish translation for ""the apple"". If I had known this I would have passed on this purchase and continued searching for a better option.",1290988800,7,812,4.1455696202531644
