8544135,5,B009SOWXRC,"I so loved this series. I had never watched martial arts type movies, they were just not my thing. I happened to walk through the living room as my husband was watching this series and I was immediately caught up in the plot. A small boy who has a twisted body at birth and the overcoming of his disabilities. I love this series because they spent a lot of time on the childhood before he grows into a man. The characters were wonderful, but the story blew me away. I was so addicted to watching every night. The main stars i must admit are very good eye candy too. The quality was worthy of HBO. Only one character got on my nerves( an evil man who likes to lick his sword.)The fighting scenes are realistic, no flying through the air junk, that turned me off to other M.A. movies. Im telling all my friends who also don't like martial arts movies, to watch this. It is much more than just fighting it is a really great story as well.",1360281600,,935,4.229050279329609
