2441290,1,B000BU0BB2,"The first time I put this workout DVD on, I expected to see exercises designed for abs, buns and thighs.  What I actually saw was an easier version of the kickboxing DVD.  I kept going, thinking it would get to the abs, buns and thighs, but it never did!  The other huge problem with this video is that half of it is filmed from the waist up, or headshots only, so when you are being introduced to a new step in the routine, you can't even learn it, because you cannot see the instructors legs or feet.  Also very irritating how there are interruptions in filming, picking up on a different beat to where it left off.  All in all an awful purchase and not even worth the $4.86 paid.  I turned it off halfway through the second workout and put Billy Blanks TaeBo on instead.  MUCH BETTER!!!",1153872000,6,789,4.29054054054054
2441291,2,B000BU0BB2,"This DVD was a great workout,shot in beautiful locations, but I was expecting a little more body sculpting in those specific areas(Abs,Buns,Thighs). It was 3 20 min.programs. 1 program had slight weights(circuit traing). The other 2 were hi/low aerobics. So I was disappointed in the naming of this workout. I feel it is definitely an aerobics based taped, not sculpting for your Abs-Buns&Thighs. I am going to try the pilates tape,because of the beautiful locations and I like Shelley & Jennifer.",1140393600,9,497,5.148148148148148
2441292,3,B000BU0BB2,"This video definitely gives you a workout. You'll work up a sweat and get your heart rate up. However, Shelly is really hard to follow. I feel like I would have to watch each segment a few times before even attempting to do the workouts in order to keep up with them. She is all over the place and rarely tells you what she is about to do before she does it. It is a highly choreographed workout. Also, it doesn't have any workouts that target the Abs, Buns, or Thighs. It is great as a cardio workout though.",1363132800,,509,4.151515151515151
2441293,1,B000BU0BB2,This dvd looks really wonderful I enjoy the other ones I have. I wanted this one for the PILATES...  I however did not recive this DVD there was another one with aerobics only .,1361145600,,177,4.205882352941177
2441294,5,B000BU0BB2,Hi am am 25 years old .I have been using this videos for about 8 years now and I love it. it always makes me sweat soo much more than other work outs DVD's I've tried. The first complete work out circuit training is about 25 minutes non stop aerobics and muscle toning. It works great  for toning muscles and shaping up your buns and the rest of your body.  I first bouth it at Ross. for about $4 and that one got scratched up and was not able to use it anymore. went back to Ross and they do not carry them anymore. therfore i found it hear on Amazon got it shiped and continue to use it about twice a week for cardio. love it recommend it to anyone trying to get in shape and only have about 30 minutes per day.,1332115200,5,713,3.9444444444444446
2441295,4,B000BU0BB2,"I did receive my DVD in a timely manner. However, it does take a few tries to get the pilates portion of the DVD going, which can be frustrating but, once it is on, it plays through with no problems.",1326758400,,199,4.0
2441296,1,B000BU0BB2,This was a waste of money especially since I had already purchased the double pack of kickboxing and aerobics. It has two of the same workouts that are on the aerobics DVD. I purchased this because I thought it would be more sculpting and that would compliment the cardio workouts I purchased but that was not the case.,1221955200,3,319,4.517241379310345
2441297,5,B000BU0BB2,"I purchased this set for the Abs, Buns & Thighs workout and found that I loved the Core Pilates even better!  With three 20 minute segments it is easy to fit in a pilates workout at any time.  The music is relaxing and the moves are challenging but not difficult. I really like the instructors and feel they talk you through the movements very well which is great for beginners. Overall I noticed that you get out of it what you put into it. So if you really focus on the stretching and the muscles you are working on you get a better workout.  This was my first Pilates workout ever. I eventually took a Pilates course and am a certified pilates instructor, but I prefer the caribbean workout pilates because when I am done I feel I worked my core well, but I am very relaxed due to the atmosphere in the video.
The cardio dvd (abs, buns, thighs) is good, but I have no coordination for those type of workouts LOL, and felt there wasn't enough review on the moves before we had to put them all together.",1220659200,8,1004,4.273684210526316
2441298,4,B000BU0BB2,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this dvd, with the exception that they seem to have made it for t.v. as they have some ""pauses"" which are not too long.  I guess they are more annoying than anything, cause they really  don't interfere with the actual workout.",1205193600,6,243,4.377777777777778
2441299,4,B000BU0BB2,"I like the Carribbean series because they are fun, they provide a great workout, and I don't get bored with them.  This dvd has 3 20 minute workouts on it.  Both the first and second workout have moves that really work the areas listed in the title.  The first called ""circuit training"" is really a high impact cardio with 4 interludes of a various squat with weighted arm lifts.  The second workout is another great high impact cardio.  The 3rd workout is not high impact like it the menu states, its really a low-impact.",1187049600,4,522,4.51063829787234
2441300,3,B000BU0BB2,"This workout is mediocre. I haven't tried a lot of videos, but I was recommended this one. I have a hard time following the actions because the camera is focused on the womens' heads or showing the scenery. This would be better for someone more familiar with aerobics.",1167955200,3,268,4.604166666666667
2441301,5,B000BU0BB2,"The title is misleading: Abs, Buns and Thighs remind me of a strength training workout however this DVD is all-cardio with very minimal strength training. It's a fun and intense (intermediate-level) workout! You get three 20-minute segments: 1 circuit training, 1 more-low impact and 1 more-high impact workouts. I got a good sweat after I did all three segments and I consider myself a high intermediate/low advanced exerciser. I didn't have a hard time following the moves and I disagree with Tina who said that the focus of the camera is more on headshots and the upper body. I have done this workout a couple of times already and the focus of the camera is on the total body with some upper and lower body focus. I also disagree with Tina when she said the kickboxing is easy. Fact is, there is no kickboxing segment in this DVD. People should note that these workouts were taken from Fit TV so there are naturally ""gaps"" or ""breaks"" where they put in the commercials. However, for the DVD, you don't get the commercials so that's why people think there are ""interruptions"" in filming. I was able to follow the moves right after the ""breaks"" so I didn't have a problem at all. All in all, a great purchase at a bargain price!",1157155200,5,1229,4.590909090909091

8092622,2,B000BU0BB2,"I wanted to like this, but it's not that great.  The best part is that it is filmed on a beach, so it's scenic.  The music is louder than the instructor, so there's a sound issue. The instructor goes really fast, which isn't great for those with joint issues.  I was really disappointed in the circuit workout because it was heavy on aerobics and light on the sculpting.  It's broken into three workouts - two are hi/lo cardio, and the circuit workout.  Shelly McDonald, the instructor, and the two backgrounders are both fit, so it's inspiring.  However, it's an aerobics DVD that's misnamed.

I've got more to try in this series.  The best part is that they are all filmed outside in a pretty setting, but that's not enough to keep me coming back ot the DVD.",1496880000,,760,4.4963503649635035
8092623,2,B000BU0BB2,"The title of this workout DVD is misleading. It has one circuit workout and two aerobics workouts - it is not toning for the abs, buns, and thighs, and the workouts do not emphasize the abs, buns, and thighs. Not what I was looking for.",1467849600,,236,4.266666666666667
8092624,2,B000BU0BB2,"I don't like how it is filmed. If you don't know the steps my there names it is hard to follow, because they don't follow her feet. It skips to the back drops.",1448841600,,159,3.8484848484848486

8092630,5,B000BU0BB2,"Years ago, I used to tape the Caribbean Workout on FitTv, but I haven't seen it on TV in years.  I was so excited to find these DVDs on Amazon and I purchased several of them.  I attend hour-long fitness classes three times per week and I use these videos on the days in between to get a quick workout in.  I love that they are fast, easy to follow, and Shelly McDonald is such a positive, sweet person that her instructions are fun to watch.  Definitely recommend these!",1393545600,2,471,4.258426966292135
