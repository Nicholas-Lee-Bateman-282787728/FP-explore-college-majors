Streaming
1953

Film = solid three (3) stars; cinematography = 3.5 stars; subtitles = three (3) stars; score = three (3) stars; set design = 2.5 stars; restoration = barely 1.5 stars.  Director Shirou Toyoda's tragic tale (based on a novel with the same name) of female oppression and societal de facto incarceration (a favorite theme) at the start of the paternalistic Meiji era (late 1800s) in a poor small town (and on cheap small studio sets) provides a showcase for Hideko Takamine (HT) (a favorite lead actress).  As a result of many otherwise admirable traits (including modesty, patience, kindness, and a trusting nature), beauty, but lack of education, HT's character is usually preyed upon and exploited by just about everyone she encounters: match-making tricksters; a penniless and parasitic father; her former husband (who dumped her when she discovered he was still married and had a family); her patron and ""pending"" middle-aged husband (who really has no plans for divorcing his slightly-unhinged wife and marrying his ""damaged-goods"" mistress); and on and on.  (It also turns out that her current ""master"" is the richest and most despised man in town, since he is a usurious money lender.)  Toyoda's movie does not gain altitude until he ""turns loose"" HT (about a third of the way along).  With often spectacular results!  The actress's dialog is sparse, but (with the help of the cinematographer and the lighting director) her subtle facial expression and body language say it all.  The viewer always knows what her character is thinking even when silent (and really thinking when speaking).  HT seems to have developed this technique to perfection!  Cinematography (narrow screen, gray and white) is fine.  Lateral tracking shots between rooms are well executed.  Lighting is a bit sparse in some scenes.  Score (which seems to be always running in the background) is okay.  So are subtitles.  Restoration has yet to occur and is frankly embarrassing, since this movie was streamed off the new FilmStruck/Criterion site no less!  Loud popping occurs throughout the film.  Scenes are gray and white rather than black and white.  Reel splices are usually visible.  So are the old visual cues for projectionists to change reels (a large dot flashes in the upper right of the screen--remember these?).  Opening credits look like they were partially run through a cement mixer.  The film is almost 70 years old and looks it.  But rises above it's lack of restoration.  Recommended.

A woman believes that she is married to a prosperous man, but suddenly discovers that he is already married and that she is no more than his mistress. Set in the period when Japan was moving toward industrialization, The Mistress explores the confict between the demands of society and individual freedom.",1146960000,,462,5.078947368421052
