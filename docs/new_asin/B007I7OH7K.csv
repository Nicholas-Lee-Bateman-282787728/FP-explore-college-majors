At least with the charcoal action drawing, she showed how to translate photograph to drawing, but the pencil gestural drawing was worthless.  The line drawing she drew from didn't show you what IT was drawn from (model or photograph) and there was no interpretation needed because it had already been done.  Most of the video consists of power point text slides of the spoken dialogue (I HATE it when presenters put up a slide and then read it to you) which really bogged down the presentation.  It seemed to be about 65% talking and 35% actual demonstration.

When push comes to shove, if you have access to You Tube, you will find better instruction for free.  This was not worth the money.",1435622400,,861,4.5519480519480515
