8086558,3,B000BGR0NI,"In volume 3, the quality of animation and level of relatively competent story-telling remains consistent with the first two volumes. The action, however, is a bit more subdued. Tetsujin takes a back seat as the boy detective solves ""human"" mysteries and uses the gigantic robot only as a last resort. Where are the huge robot on robot battles? It's a bit disappointing, particularly since this is the first volume with only 4 episodes... as opposed to the 5 (on volumes 1 and 2).",1174176000,2,479,4.783132530120482
