Her acting ability in the Italian arias and her perceptive understanding of the French songs are outstanding .  And to be sure we don't forget her abilities in getting the pop song across, she ends this Firestone DVD with a very convincing, uniquely sung torch song!  Brava sempre, Eileen Farrell.  I wish there were full opera performances of her days at the Met!!
