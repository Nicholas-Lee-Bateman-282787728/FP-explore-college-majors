4172214,5,B003R0LVDK,"dbz kai is outstanding ,and it has never looked better,

1080p output,dolby trueHD,it cant get anybetter then this

they reanimated some of the fight scenes,and reanimated some scenes to progress the story more quickly,that makes it look even better.

the new voice cast will grow on ya,they keep some of the old ones so its ok to me,

i must suggest to get this on bluray cause i don't think they will ever release the original dbz on blu ray format.

the packaging i like, (but i like everything dragon ball),so it looks cool.

and it has no filler it progresses the story faster ,with more action,like i said this release is freakin sweet!!!!!!

this is a must have.

i recommend this to all DBZ fans!!",1291680000,,705,4.5396825396825395
4172215,5,B003R0LVDK,Always liked Dragonball Z. Now I love it. This revamp of the series was worth the wait.,1286841600,2,87,4.176470588235294
4172216,5,B003R0LVDK,"Well, I have to say Kai is amazing, it is DBZ the way it was meant to be seen, no filler, and faster paced action. I just wish they would be released sooner, 4 months each is a while to wait.",1285113600,6,191,3.682926829268293
4172217,5,B003R0LVDK,"As I said in my review about part 1: I have been watching DBZ for about 10 years now, and I am happy that I can finally watch every episode and not get bored from all the fillers and stand-offs from the original.

Likes-
New intro
Fixing of the scenes that were damaged over the years
Taking out the fillers
Better English dialogue
Excellent sound quality
Pretty much exactly like the manga
New animated breaks in between parts of an episode that actually change as the episodes progress.

Dislikes-
No marathon mode

I think Dragon Ball Z Kai is awesome, it gets me excited to watch the whole series again. My guess is there will be 7 parts to the whole Dragon Ball Z Kai series. Reason why I say this is because, on the right side of the case, in the middle of the corresponding stars where it says what part it is. There are 7 stars lined up in a row.",1284508800,6,854,4.226993865030675
4172218,4,B003R0LVDK,"The first 13 episodes run for $21.49 currently on Amazon.  The next 13 are $37?

Um . . . what?  Guys, I'll get all 100 episodes if the pricing stays reasonable, but hopping around on your price point ain't gonna cut it.

The content itself is awesome.  No filler, direct Toriyama Dragon Ball Z, presented with the pace it was originally intended to have.  Wonderful!

The English sub work is also quite good as well.  Let's just get the pricing figured out so we as consumers don't feel like we're getting jerked around.

Minus 1 star for jumping $15 in cost for no apparent reason.",1278547200,7,583,4.476190476190476
4172219,5,B003R0LVDK,The Saiya-Jin saga. Vegeta and Napa's story never looked so good. There is no filler! Colors and film tearing have been repaired. This old video looks amazing.,1354492800,,159,4.925925925925926
4172220,5,B003R0LVDK,"This DVD set rocks!! Just like the first release, this set has no filler, more action, and a shorter amount of time just to get from Goku vs. Vegeta saga to the Namek saga in just 26 episodes! Much better dialogue compared to the original Dragon Ball Z series that was loaded with too much filler and lag time (and bad dubbing too...) :)",1338854400,,337,4.28125
4172221,5,B003R0LVDK,"Kai is simply amazing. It's a revered and respectful follow-up that the original DragonBall deserved. The audio and animation are spot on in here. No edits that I can detect. The only downside that I can think of is that there isn't an option to view the episodes in a Marathon mode or watch them with the TV Version opening instead of the DVD exclusive opening. Sorry, but I prefer the TV version over this one. But please, don't stop-don't stop WE'RE IN LOVE NOW!",1331683200,,465,4.482352941176471
4172222,5,B003R0LVDK,"I have been a loyal fan of Dragon Ball Z since I was younger and watching the original run on Toonami and on VHS. I drifted away from DBZ for many years but have been an anime enthusiast ever since DBZ got me hooked.

Dragon Ball Z Kai caught my eye for several reasons: mainly being remastered yet retaining the original 4:3 aspect ratio (unlike the previous two versions that chopped part of the format to be presented in pseudo widescreen). I have faithfully purchased the Kai series (the titles released so far) on Blu-Ray. Here are my thoughts:

Part two takes us through the the episodes leading up to the major battles on Namek. These episodes begin after Vegeta's battle on earth and lead up to his final battle with Zarbon on Namek.  For those familiar with the series, these episodes contain less action but a lot more important story than others.  There is also the sense of urgency of finding and protecting the Namek dragon balls from both Vegeta and Freiza.  Good stuff, though not as action packed as part three.

Technical stuff:
The ratio is kept to the original 4:3 aspect. Some animations have been cleaned and even re-animated (in the case of some of the lighting effects from ki attacks and power-ups). Some of the re-animated shots look like something from American Saturday morning cartoons rather than anime, but these instances were very rare. The two that stood out were in this volume actually (a couple of Vegeta's moves).

The sound is vastly superior to the previous versions. The English dub is improved and they aren't afraid to get a little dirty (they swear often, but not in an offensive way. They just yell 'you bastard' a lot). Though the few uses of swearing is in line with the more literal translation. Also, the American voice acting is a lot better this time through. Most of the lines have been slightly changed to stick closer to the actual translation. The Japanese voice acting is the original (highly amusing in some roles) though it has also been cleaned up a bit so that static is removed.

The music is the original Japanese score, just re-digitized for this release. It is superior to the original Japanese and the American scores (though the American score was pretty good considering).

Editing:
Here is where most die hard Dragon Ball Z fans choke up: There is a lot of cut content. I have seen the original, un-cut, American and Japanese versions. I gotta tell you. You're not missing anything. Most of what was cut was pure filler by TOEI trying to fill time slots. They've also removed a lot of re-used cells. I remember how annoyed I was to see Piccolo battling the Android and TOEI reusing animation cells from the Piccolo-Raditz battle. Seriously. Also, I don't hear too many people upset about missing out on the Garlic Jr saga.

They cut about 50 episodes (give or take) and reduced the amount to 98 (through the Cell Games saga). I don't know if they will continue through the Buu saga (no word yet even in Japan), but I am a huge fan on the improvement in quality of picture and sound so I hope they do.

Also of note: the Blu-Ray version is presented in full HD, though the original show was analog and standard definition. There is a noticeable difference between the DVD and Blu-Ray version in animation clarity and quality. There is also a major difference on the sound. The difference is worth the $2 or so for the Blu-Ray vs DVD if you have a player.",1309910400,2,3420,4.608552631578948
4172223,4,B003R0LVDK,"The battle between Vegeta and Goku comes to it's end and we reach the start of what many consider to be the original DBZ's greatest saga: Namek!

Quick recap for those who don't know about Kai: DBK is the 20th aniversary version of DBZ. That annoying filler that would make entire story arcs last forever and lead to the nickname Drag-on Ball Z? Totally gone and replaced with a remastered version that has a much quicker pace. How much quicker are we talking? Well as of this writing episode 92 just aired in Japan and saw Cell destroying Android 16 and Gohan's transformation to Super Saiyan 2. In the original DBZ this was the 184th episode! So what was the 92nd episode of Z you ask? That was the episode where Goku began powering up for the Spirit Bomb on Namek. Note that I said BEGAN not USED. The attack was charged over the course of three episodes before it was even used.

Needless to say this quick pace favors those that could never get into the original DBZ anime due to it's length as well as manga purists that don't care for anything filler. Animation is improved and cleaned up all around with the occasional new clip to help make up for damaged film. Script wise the Japanese version is about the same despite everything being rerecorded for 2009-2011. Meanwhile the English version sees it's best and most accurate translation ever with a good portion of the Funimation voice cast returning. Even if you are a purist that didn't really care for the English voices in any form at least try to watch it in English at least once. The English dub of DBK Part One has taught us that Goku does indeed curse at times, his power level is over 8000 and that Piccolo's attack is the Makankosappo. Part Two goes on to show us that Vegeta gets ""pissed off"", Frieza's men are extremely brutal and violent and that Frieza himself can indeed sound even more intimidating with a new voice that's more in line with the original Japanese.

If you don't own any of the season box sets or Dragon Boxes of the original Z then do yourself a favor and pick this up! Just please bear in mind that the DVD/Blu-Ray release of Kai is NOT the edited version on Nicktoons. This release is NOT intended for children and is totally uncut.",1297209600,,2227,4.480295566502463
4172224,5,B003R0LVDK,"I don't know if every FUNIMATION Bluray have A/B Region but that is the coolest thing that FUNIMATION have ever make, because in Spain we don't have this anime series relesed on dvd or Bluray (we have dubbed for TV, but not more).

4172225,5,B003R0LVDK,For the hardcore fans I'd suggest that you get both Kai & the full original DBZ series. For the casual perhaps just Kai. Looks great on Blu,1295136000,,139,4.185185185185185
4172226,5,B003R0LVDK,"It is true that you miss some of the more humorous moments and side character development scenes, but the sound and visual quality can't be beat and you can get through the main story line much faster this way (around 100 episodes total) compared to the original version (291 episodes).",1292284800,,286,4.74
4172227,5,B003R0LVDK,"I've since given up on the english dub of the original Dragon Ball Z anime.  Compared to the original Japanese version, it just wasn't accurate.  The dub of Dragon Ball Z Kai on the other hand, is freaking incredible.  The script is accurate and the voice actors sound amazing.  For this set, I loved J. Michael Tatum as Zarbon and Chris Ayers as Frieza.  All of the original cast members who stayed on from the first DBZ series are great too.  If you're a fan of Dragon Ball, you have to see this series.  If you haven't seen Dragon Ball before, then this is the version of the series you want to see!",1291852800,,602,4.274336283185841
4172228,5,B003R0LVDK,"The original ""Dragon Ball Z"" packed a lot of unnecessary fat onto the meat of Toriyama Akira's manga.  Adapted from the final twenty-six volumes of the manga series, the producers wanted to stretch out the story into as many episodes as possible to stuffed in a bunch of filler and random content onto the main story.

""Dragon Ball Z Kai"" takes a carving knife to the series and slices away all that extra, leaving only the pure Toriyama-elements.  Reducing the series by more than half, ""Dragon Ball Z Kai"" has a hundred episodes compared to ""Dragon Ball Z""'s two hundred and ninety-one.  That, my friends, is a lot of filler.  A hundred and ninety-one episodes of filler.

Along with the episode reduction, ""Dragon Ball Z Kai"" has digitally restored the faded cels, replaced missing cels, and recorded both a new English dub and a new Japanese voice track using a mix of new and original voice actors to match up with the re-tooled version.  In short, ""Dragon Ball Z Kai"" is like a straight shot of tequila compared to the original ""Dragon Ball Z""'s froofy, over-decorated blender marguerite..

Boxset Two of ""Dragon Ball Z Kai"" has episodes 14-26 on two DVDs. The episodes start with Goku powering up with the 3x Kaio-ken to duke it out with Vegeta, and ends with a final throw-down between Vegeta and Zarbon.  And in-between is action, action, action.

If you have never gotten into ""Dragon Ball"" and always been curious about it, then these Kai releases are the way to go.",1291766400,8,1477,4.712062256809339

8402768,4,B003R0LVDK,"This part covers the last couple episodes of the Saiyan arc which look and sound pretty damn awesome in high definition on Blu-ray, and for Dragon Ball fans this is a must own without a doubt, even despite that the credits have all been translated to English I still can get over that because they included the original soundtrack before it hit the fan.

However, if you decide to get the Season sets then you'll be hearing the replacement score which is a very limited amount of tracks from Dragon Ball Z and doesn't really allow Kikuchi's music to shine, if anything, it ruins it.",1400371200,,582,4.542857142857143

I didn't mind the Namek saga (as a transition to the Ginyu Force), and this is fun to watch, just like the entire show.",1365897600,,406,4.0875
8402770,3,B003R0LVDK,"I decided to get this because I had bought part 1 over 2 years ago. The revised music track is a snooze fest and doesn't help the series at all, infact it has several different styles that don't fit the overall scheme of the series and thankfully it goes away by the second season (part 3 and 4) so I'm forgiving this. The dub always seems to get better after each time they redo the series and Kai is very exceptional in this direction. However I do wish they hadn't touched the opening and ending themes, worse off, each volume has a new version of the opening song.",1362960000,,568,4.268518518518518
8402771,5,B003R0LVDK,dragonball z had alot of filler making it heart renching when you saw the anime. Now its more heart renching and pacing i enjoy kai better than z many reasons why its straight to the anime. Hopefully buus arc will be released were up to the cell arc. I enjoyed z along time ago when i was younger but yes i was collecting the orange boxes but to watch the series as it was suppossed to be makes it more valuable as it was suppossed to be. Dragonball z kai is correctly to how toriyama san wanted dragonball z to be during its original production. people should watch dragonball in z or kai what ever they please so pick up a copy of any version of z the way people want to watch it.,1361145600,,682,4.097014925373134
