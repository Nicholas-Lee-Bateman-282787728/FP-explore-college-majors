8708924,5,B00V111IFS,"This is another in the fine series of documentaries being released by First Run Features on the 1960s  especially the ones about iconic magazines like the New Yorker (I forget the title but I did review on Amazon) and this one on Harold Hayes who was the second editor for Esquire Magazine and tool it through the 1960s. These were the years of civil rights, great pop art and womens liberation. Oh yes we had both the 1964 and 1968 Presidential elections along with the Vietnam War.

The 97 minute film is conceived, written, produced and directed by Hayes son Tom, who narrates the film as well. His father knew everyone but  apparently  wasn't home a lot. Yet the younger Hayes has gather some great archival footage and snagged some really good interviews with folks like writer Nora Ephron, Gay Talese, Tom Wolfe and Gore Vidal (all Esquire writers) plus Hugh Hefner, who was competing with Esquire at being a mens magazine. Ad exec George Lois created the many controversial covers and Lois is always great to hear. (Id love it if someone did a documentary on him. He is funny and an engaging talker.).

There are some nice bonuses here too: Three extended interviews (from which some excerpts were included in the 2012 film): Gore Vidal (on his war with William Buckley), Nora Ephron (on working at Esquire) and Gay Talese (on his trend-breaking essay on Frank Sinatra).
With over 3 hours of material, this DVD will really appeal to anyone in publishing, anyone who lived through the 1960s and anyone who enjoys documentaries. I loved kit.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
