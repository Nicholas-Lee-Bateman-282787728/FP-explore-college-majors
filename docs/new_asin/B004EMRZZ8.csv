8427245,5,B004EMRZZ8,"I watched this many years ago in a small theatre in a small Maryland town. This was the first time I had seen Lionel Jeffries. I thought his scenes giving driving lessons, and as a lover were hysterical. I watched it again recently and didn't think it was quite as funny, but still very funny.
I highly recommend it.",1484179200,,316,4.372881355932203
8427246,3,B004EMRZZ8,"A 17-year-old girl writes a pulp novel, basing the characters on her own parents, the family doctor and the like, without their knowing. The book is published (in unbelievably short order), everyone in the town reads it as a tell-all, and the expected embarrassments ensue. When the parents finally sit down to read it we get an enactment, and it's when the fun begins. In a fairly benign parody of the Angry Young Men school of writing popular at the time, the cast members assume their roles in the book. Best is Dilys Laye; briefly glimpsed in the early scenes as the father's ultra-efficient secretary, she now appears as his mistress, a hard-bitten trollope with lacquered hair and nails. If you were to come in on the scene where she confronts the daughter, leering at her and calling her ""cherub"", you might not realize it's a satire. Joan Hickson, of Miss Marple fame, briefly pops up as a smarmy couturier, giving her lines a nice spin (as always, I wanted more of her). Based on a stage play called ""Book Of The Month"", and directed by Gerald Thomas, famous for the ""Carry On"" series of films.",1243555200,3,1103,4.63265306122449
8427247,5,B004EMRZZ8,"Crazy 50's British humor from the people that do it best. Everyone acts silly, everyone becomes outraged - then we get a warm fuzzy ending leaving us feeling quite warm and fuzzy ourselves. Highly recommended.",1189468800,5,209,5.0
