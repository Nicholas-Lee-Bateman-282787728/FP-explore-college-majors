8089162,5,B000BMUUZW,"My affiliation with and affection for The Merry Widow goes back MANY years to when I performed Camille in an amateur production. I have every CD and DVD available, because when it is done well, it is a perfect example of operetta at its most melodic and charming. On stage, it can be a pure delight, while an audio only recording provides for toe tapping rhthyms.

Having earlier purchased the Arthaus version, with Dagmar Schellenberger, Rodney Gilfry and a young Piotr Beczala, I believed that the work could not better performed than that 2005 production. Well, gentle reader, that observation, while still mostly true, had to be modified when this gem hit the player last night.

My interest was occasioned by a review in the July 2015 issue of Opera News which gave lavish praise to the Morbusch production (coincidently, also done in 2005) Opera News was correct: this is a splendid effort!

While none of the singers was known to me, all did exceptionally well, both musically and dramatically. Margrita De Arellano is vocally nuanced and absolutely sexy as Hanna, while Mathias Hausmann's Danilo is perfectly sung and acted to perfection. Marwan Shamiyeh's Camille shows off a light but ringing tenor voice, which executes the two high Cs with spot on accuracy.

But to me, the real star of this performance is the conductor, Rudolf Bibl, whose reading of the score is perfect, from start to finish.

Disc quality is mostly very good, marred slightly by bleed through of reds in the last act only. Sound generates a very satisfying surround effect, although not near the fabulous HD MA effect on Blu ray discs. The outdoor venue does cause a diminution of the vocal intensity, but not enough to diminish my enjoyment of the performance.

Not to be missed, friends. It's the real deal!

In sum, this is an e",1435363200,9,1814,4.813504823151125
