8296558,3,B00007K080,It was good to see the female fighters take the lead in this movie.  The fighting sequences for the actresses was pretty well done.  There were some funny bits here and there.  Unfortunately the story is told through in a series of disjointed scenes; and in the end the fight between the heroin and villain was less a 20 seconds.,1480809600,,329,4.45

8296565,4,B00007K080,"I like these old movies so it is hard for me to find a bad one,of course the dubbing is bad,of course the plot is thin,of course people are doing the impossible,but this just adds to the charm of these old movies.
Oh and YES!! Of course there is plenty of ACTION!
Some pretty crazy stuff too...Little people fighting ten year olds,blind old women,blind young women,a man with a knife for a hand,two seven foot perverts trying hard to rape a woman....any woman as long as she knows kung fu and plenty of wine to go around...boy, wish I could drink like that!! I Love it and if you grew up in the 70's you will love it too! I had to add this to my collection!
The blind lady heroine in this movie is so bad  that she would give Xena herself a run for the money,and she can hold her liquor...errr I mean wine,I think I'm in love! Don't take it too seriously,watch it with your buddies and have a good laugh!",1383091200,,904,4.195402298850575
