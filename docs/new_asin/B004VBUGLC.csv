8443149,5,B004VBUGLC,"I bought this DVD and found it to be of invaluable help to building my first PC. The DVD has lots of up-to-date information and the practical lessons are very clear and detailed. After putting all the parts together, I took a deep breath and pressed the power button on my newly built pc. It goes without saying that I was overwhelmed to see my first effort was a complete success thanks to this well organised, well thought through DVD which I fully recommend to anyone who fancy taking the plunge in building a pc. Besides, the author - with whom I communicated through emails several times - was very helpful and he responded speedily to my questions. For some reason, I had difficulty ordering the DVD from the author's website, but got it anyway from Amazon instead and had to wait for 3-4 weeks for the DVD to arrive. When I pointed this out to the author, he immediately allowed me one month free access to his website to watch the lessons online while waiting for my DVD to arrive. As a result I was able to start on my project well before the actual DVD arrived. I hope the author will be generous enough to allow free updates of the contents of the DVD on his website!!!",1327708800,,1180,4.392694063926941
8443150,4,B004VBUGLC,"NOTE: I ordered DVD from author's web site (of the same name).

I was trying to purchase a speedy PC at a reasonable cost. I couldn't find all of what i wanted for less than $1K, so I bought the parts... only problem is that I've not built a PC before. Have changed out just about everything short of a mother board, but not the whole shebang.

I tried  ""googling"" ""How build windows 7 PC"" but kept getting such crazy links, or endless rabbit trails... It was very confusing. I was trying to find info about an orderly way to proceed... step 1, step 2, etc. Some magazine articles on line & in print (PC WORLD, MAXIMUM PC)about building PC... left out some details, in my opinion.

Anyway, this DVD was extremely useful. Additionally, there is  ""package"" of this DVD along with access to the author's ""Home PC Builder"" web site information (videos & written summaries) for a month (subjects include: building PC, navigating BIOS, installing OS, overclocking CPU & memory, etc; networking... a lot of good information). These are wonderful, well-organized videos explaining all this stuff. The price is reasonable, ($35 as of Dec 2011). But, you have to remember to go back & cancel the subscription or you are charged another $19.95 for an additional month (I remembered, but that sucks, in my opinion). I got to talk with Michael a couple of times. He was helpful. He mailed my DVD out ""pronto"" and I was able to study, view videos on web site while awaiting parts (and DVD) to arrive. There is a forum on the site and again Michael answered more questions about my pending build.

Using the DVD on a laptop while I built the PC, I could work along the suggested step by step video. Of course, the example being built and my computer weren't exact (he explains Intel vs. AMD and has separate videos that cover these different installs) and I had to negotiate the ""mobo"" documents vs. the ""case"" docs, for example. that was about the hardest part for me- getting the wires all plugged in. Eventually, the PC fired up & was looking for an OS when I first fired it up. The Windows 7 PRO (use the OEM version for your own build) install went easily and I anticipated what to do to set up SSD drive as boot disk. So, OK; you should be able to do it also. This DVD can help.

IN SUMMARY: This DVD is excellent. The only reason I'm docking review one star is the BS about having to remember to go back & ""un-subscribe"" if one opts to buy the month of access to the web site along with the DVD from the author's site. Maybe author will see this and reconsider this policy/ approach. (I'd suggest throw in a month's access to the web site along with the purchased DVD for free-- would be a great marketing tool, in my humble opinion).",1326412800,,2726,4.4509018036072145
8443151,5,B004VBUGLC,"I purchased this DVD and I must say that I was very pleased with how detailed they were. I was able to complete my first build with ease because everything I needed to know was covered beautifully in each step-by-step video module. When I first powered up my new build and heard that wonderful single beep (which by the way lets you know that everything is connected properly and working}, I was overjoyed. I can't stop looking at this beautiful beast of a computer (yes, I am quite an enthusiast).

I highly recommend this video to all first time builders out there. I am very pleased with my results and I believe you will be pleased, too!",1312243200,2,641,4.478632478632479
8443152,5,B004VBUGLC,"I am a complete amateur with computers and these videos were invaluable when I decided to build my own gaming centric computer.  The videos cover every single detail (maybe too much detail for someone with some computer experience), so there was nothing that went overlooked. I'm not one of those ""handy man"" types, so I wasn't expecting success on my first try, but to my surprise, everything worked the first time I fired up my computer.  I watched the videos on my laptop as I was putting my computer together, and I think that helped a lot.  Also, customer support is excellent, as I received very timely email and phone assistance when a couple issues surfaced after I put my computer together. I highly recommend these videos for anyone building a PC.",1303084800,,757,4.71969696969697
8443153,5,B004VBUGLC,"Watched all the videos.  Lots of good info, and it all made sense.  Well organized.  I have parts on order and will watch them again when building.  Good value, and highly recommended.",1302739200,,184,4.65625
