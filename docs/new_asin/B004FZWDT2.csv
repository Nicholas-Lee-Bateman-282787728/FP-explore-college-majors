4371605,3,B004FZWDT2,"Marlee Meade (played by Petunia Rhubarb) is a young reporter in Crisper County who is tired of the veggie interest fluff pieces she normally does.  She quits her job to revitalize the local theater.  Teaming up with her cameraman/writer (played by Larry the Cucumber), she decided to put on a new musical ""Up with Bunnies.""  It will premier right before Easter and use musical theater to spread hope to others.

Then she learns that local girl made good Cassie Cassava (voiced by American Idol finalist Melinda Doolittle), winner of the TV talent show is going to be in town to sing at her home church on Easter Sunday.  Marlee knows that if she can get Cassie to perform during opening night, she'll reach a wider audience.  Can she do it?  Will that really help the community?

Now please don't misunderstand what I am about to say.  I found this video to be quite fun, possibly one of the funnier videos that they've put out recently.  I laughed a few times at some of the pop culture references, even for shows I don't watch.  And I loved catching a couple of classic songs and some characters we haven't seen in a while pop up.  The new silly song is fun as well.

However....

We've seen the theater plot in these videos a couple of times already, couldn't they have come up with something new?

The theme of this episode is that we need to help others.  No problem with that.  But why make it an Easter video?  They could have done a normal episode without the Easter trappings and had the same moral.  Yes, they tie it into Jesus' sacrifice for us, but it seems weak to me.

Worse yet, they mention a couple of times what Easter is really about, but they don't really get into it.  If you don't already know what they believe, you wouldn't know any better after watching this tape.

I think part of my frustration is that their first Easter video,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Veggie-Tales-An-Easter-Carol/dp/B001LOR3TU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Veggie Tales: An Easter Carol</a>, is still one of my favorites, and I love how it really explores what Easter means and why it matters.  This one doesn't even come close to touching it.

If you enjoy the humor of the series, you'll enjoy this episode.  But be sure to get The Easter Carol, too since that's the one you'll want to make sure you watch every year.",1299283200,44,2363,4.761083743842365

I also appreciate that Veggie Tales exist, otherwise what other cartoon will show anything about God or Jesus, or even a church with such fun cartoons (there are other cartoons made but none like this one, which is more like the secular counterparts that they are compiting with to hold the kids attetion). You know what I mean? So I'm just thankful there was something we can show our 3 yold that he really enjoyed. And he really did!",1492128000,2,650,4.612068965517241

4371635,1,B004FZWDT2,"Before I get into my review, let me say that, like other reviewers, I typically like Veggie Tales.  However, after teaching (and reteaching) my children the story of Christ's death and resurrection, I thought it would be fun to watch a Veggie Tales Easter episode, assuming (wrongly), that it would incorporate these truths.  This episode was barely about Easter, well perhaps Easter in the secular sense, but it did not handle Resurrection Day at all. The resurrection is the climax of the Gospel, and the story of Easter cannot be divorced from the Gospel and the fact that it is our sins that separate us from God, and that only the blood of Jesus can cleanse us.  This movie did not handle the Gospel message of the cross whatsoever, and simply emphasized good moral behavior, i.e. serving one another, forgiveness, kindness, humanitarianism, etc.  Don't get me wrong, these things are all good and traits I want to see in my children, but not what I was looking for in a Easter/Resurrection Day episode.",1428278400,15,1008,4.809248554913295

It is good, wholesome entertainment, and he learns about Jesus as well.  Win win in my book.  I got this for my son's Easter basket, and we've watched it a few times.  He's only six months old, so he's not too into TV right now, but he likes all the colors and when they sing.

4371648,2,B004FZWDT2,"I was able to watch this movie one time through and we were disappointed with how it didn't go into detail about Jesus. My main problem, though, is how any time We tried to watch it after there was a commentary from the writers over the full video. I tried to change every setting in the DVD menu and the commentary was still on top of the movie in both of the wide screen and full screen versions. This is really annoying. I took it out and we are watching something else, but I'm sure it will work after I put it back in. I just find it annoying that I can't just leave it in my sons powered down DVD player or allow him to watch it twice in a row without an option to turn off the commentary.",1398124800,,695,3.9714285714285715

4371650,4,B004FZWDT2,My kids and I LOVE VeggieTales. This is a fun and entertaining story that reminds us that the bunny and all the candy is fun but that isn't the true meaning of Easter.

4371662,1,B004FZWDT2,"From my sons: Mr. Lunt is A fine character, but he was useless in this episode. This is the worst veggietales ever. Even my second worst episode, An Easter Carol, is much better. This is too much like the Star of Christmas.
 The Star of Christmas begins with Cavis complaining to Millward that their careers aren't going anywhere He then has an idea and borrows the nearby theater. Things are going just fine... until he accidentally spreads the word about Edmund's Christmas pageant containing the Star of Christmas. He steals it to get people to his show, but the theater is destroyed. Edmund forgives him and Millward uses the ""unpressable"" button to get to the church.
Twas the Night before Easter: is pretty much the same. It doesn't even touch the true meaning of Easter and bunnies are the main theme.

All the episodes after Pistachio-The Little Boy who Wouldn't, are nowhere near as good as the episodes like Are You My Neighbor or King George and the Ducky. I certainly think Veggietales should have stopped producing episodes after Phil Vischer resigned.",1338595200,,1065,4.846153846153846
4371663,2,B004FZWDT2,The story line spent more time on bunnies than the resurrection.  It only quoted scripture rather than translating it to communicate with children.  It also did not hold the interest of my four children,1334966400,,202,4.911764705882353

4371665,2,B004FZWDT2,"I LOVE Veggie Tales, as do my two little ones (almost 2 and 3.5). So, when my mom bought this DVD for my kids for Easter this year, we were understandably excited.  My pre-schooler loved, and still loves it.  But, I have to admit that I was VERY disappointed in the content, or lack thereof.  I saw another review that said ""all flash, no substance.""  I absolutely agree 100%.  I have come to expect an emphasis on Biblical lessons/values from Veggie Tales.  I wanted to cry when this one was all bunnies and Easter eggs.  I can literally count on one hand the number of times Jesus or God are mentioned in the movie.  Several times, characters speak of how Jesus came to serve, not to be served.  Once, Bob explains that the golden egg Larry found is empty because the tomb was empty that first Easter morning (nothing about what that means for us).  And once in a song about how when we think of Easter we think about God's love.  That's it.  Nothing about what Easter is really about.  As a Christian family, Easter, or Resurrection Sunday as we like to call it, is quite arguably the most important holiday we celebrate.  To not have the true message of Easter mentioned, except in passing as Bob wraps up the message at the end of the movie, made me re-think buying some of Big Idea's newer products.  Big Idea, if you're listening, bring back Phil Vischer!!!  I think we'll be sticking with the classics from now on.  Very disappointing.  The only reason I gave this any stars at all was because my pre-schooler loves the movie so much.  The entertainment value is there.  But that's it.  No substance at all.",1312588800,2,1615,4.481099656357388

I know every song by heart and my husband and I find ourselves singing ""Bunnies, bunnies, bunnies, up, up, up, up with bunnies"" all the time.

4371672,1,B004FZWDT2,"See if this sounds familiar: Veggie decides to use theater production to teach the city a lesson. Veggie stakes a lot on production, then learns a local church is doing a show the same night, only with a star attraction which is sure to draw the audience away from Veggie's crummy more commercialized act. Veggie turns evil, steals the star with the justification that ""it can't hurt"", attempts to use star, theater burns down due to faulty invention, Veggie is ruined, forgiveness handed out in ""spirit of the holiday"".

Ring a bell? Right: Star of Christmas, possibly the least favorite and worst Veggie Tale until this one. Mike Nawrocki ought to be ashamed of the horrible repackaging of a prior VT, let alone one that was so badly done. The songs were terrible, the animation lousy, and the characters inspiring not a shred of empathy. Want to simulate the Christ-centered message of this DVD? You can't, because there's even less of a Christian message in this one than in ""Star of Christmas"". All you can do is hop around the room chanting the inane drivel, ""Bunnies, bunnies, bunnies"" until you can't stand it anymore.

Terrible DVD. If Amazon allowed negative stars, this earns it. It's the only Veggie Tale I didn't even let my kids watch, because it's really THAT bad.",1300147200,3,1279,4.782805429864253
4371673,1,B004FZWDT2,"I have never written a review on this website before, but I was so thoroughly disappointed in this Veggie Tales movie that I had to share with other potential buyers that there is a much better Easter story for kids on the market...Easter Carol, also from Veggie Tales.

I confess to being a huge Veggie fan, and even though my kids are older now, we continue to buy the new releases and enjoy them as a family.  I was surprisingly disappointed in Twas the Night Before Easter, which I found lacking in any real explanation of what Easter was, as well as so redundant of past Veggie movies (this time it isn't Larry and Bob as Cavis and Millword trying to save an old theater by stealing a star, but Petunia Rhubarb as Marlee who was committing the theft...and this time the star was a celebrity ""star,"" not a physical light-up star...but the motives were the same in each.)

I think Big Idea is trying to hard to crank out two movies a year these days and rushing through the script.  I have not liked the recent movies as much as I did the movies from Veggie's Glory Days under Phil Vischer.  I find the much less effective and the message is too forced.  At any rate, this Easter show pales sorely in comparison to it's bigger brother Easter Carol (released years earlier); if you are looking for a much better venue from which to discuss the meaning of Easter with your kids, then Easter Carol is a far better bet.",1300060800,32,1418,4.413793103448276

The animation is great, the writing was really good, the charaters good, the jokes were all there and funny, references to past Veggie Tales that fans look for were really good, music was fabulous (kids want the soundtrack)....the message as always great.......it is just something is missing.

I can not descibe it.  It just doesnt leave you ""feeling"" like the others.  It wasn't the best Veggie Tales ever, but it wasn't the worst by any means.  I have done a lot of Veggie Tales reviews and I just can not find the words other than something is missing that is on the past shows.
