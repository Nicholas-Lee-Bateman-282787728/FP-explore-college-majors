8276454,5,B001A8HTY6,"The forsaken land is a film at once strikingly beautiful and jarringly disturbing  writer / director Vimukthi Jayasundara demonstrates in this, his first feature, that he can be expected to be a visionary force that will both enthrall and shake audiences for the remainder of a career that, it can be hoped, will be a long and productive one. Taking as his subject no less than that of the effects of war and strife on not only individuals, but on humanity as a whole, and by extrapolation the very planet we inhabit, his work stands up to the task at hand very well indeed. There are images here  and the deeper thoughts which they inspire  that will remain with the viewer for years to come.

A society ruled by war will always look for a solution, be it through war or peace.
This film was conceived as a poem, where shots substitute for words.
   Vimukthi Jayasundra

Set in Sri Lanka, which has been torn apart for over thirty years by a civil war that eats away at the people and society like a cancer, Jayasundaras film draws the audience into the lives and souls of his characters. There is little dialogue  in fact, the first spoken words occur some thirteen minutes or so into the film  but volumes are communicated in the subtle nuances present in life itself, which among the arts only cinema, through its inherent combination of elements, can translate so accurately into palpable feelings. A look, a gesture, a sigh  the very landscape itself, a village on the edge of a wasteland  convey the desperation, tension, societal and emotional isolation and alienation that are the horrible byproducts of an existence lived in a constant state of waror, in the case of this film, a truce that is so fragile that even the audience senses that outright hostilities could break out again at any time. The recurring image of a tank at twilight, prowling the area at a crawl, stopping now and then, its turret slowly casting its single threatening eye about the landscape is enough to make one hold ones breath in anticipation. Without a shot being fired throughout the length of the film, the sense of danger is no less than if bullets were flying all around. This is truly life lived walking the edge of the proverbial razor.

The characters at the center of this agonizingly grinding maelstrom are few. Anura is a young man who is apparently in the hire of the military as a guard, but not actually in the army. His wife Lat is a restless, beautiful young woman who finds their interrupted relationship unfulfilling, leading her to seek companionship on the sly. Living with them is Anuras unmarried sister Som, who although seemingly the only character who is both grounded and aware of their circumstances, is resented by Lat but adored as a mother figure by Batti, a young pre-adolescent girl who lives nearby. In one particularly poignant and telling exchange, she speaks with Som of her future  instead of saying when I grow up, she says if I grow up, a painful reminder of the pointed uncertainty under which they all live. Piyasiri is an older man who shares guard duty with Anura and regales the wide-eyed Batti with folk tales, one of which sheds both light and darkness on their communal past. The story has not-too-cloaked parallels with the reality they inhabit.

The war itself  or at least the sense that it lurks in such proximity that one can hear its panting breath  is as much a character as the human beings in this film. There may be a cease-fire in place, but people disappear and killings occur at night, to be discovered when the sun casts its weary eyes on the scarred land once more. The directors incredible compositional prowess packs quite a punch  a darkened pond, with heavy clouds obscuring almost all of the available moonlight, reveals the stiff arm of a corpse seemingly sprouting like the water-based vegetation around it. Lat awakens from a restless afternoon nap, clearly in a state of emotional and sexual clamor, to methodically throw open the shutters of the house  the wind almost rips a couple of them out of her hands, exemplifying her hopelessness in controlling her desires and thoughts, blowing through the rooms like a beast in the hunt.

When Anura and Lat are awakened in the middle of the night by a pounding on their door, the young man responds and receives a command from a soldier that will change his life forever  there are things those who serve are called to perform that will linger in their mind and soul until the day they die. The helplessness he feels, the rending of his sense of self, are as real as if they were occurring to us as we watch the events play out. Afterwards, as he runs toward his home in the moonlight, seeing physically but blinded by the trauma of what he has experienced, he stumbles and collapses into the dirt, laying his face against the earth as if to reassure himself that it is still there. Its one of the most harrowing, piercing images of the film  and one that exemplifies the feeling of being ripped from all of the normal aspects of life, with little hope of ever regaining them. One reviewer wrote that the characters seem to be sleepwalking through the film  not implying any sort of wooden acting, but that the horror of their existence has numbed them almost to the point of being animatons. Their pain is real, but it has become so great that it has replaced happiness and fulfillment as the compass by which they navigate their lives.

War is inarguably a horrible environment, whatever its intensity or form  out-and-out direct combat, guerilla war, or the war conducted by shadows under cover of darkness. It traumatizes all of those it touches  combatants and innocents alike  in ways that will affect them physically, psychologically and emotionally for the rest of their lives. Vimukthi Jayasundara has seen that trauma, and has eloquently and poetically translated it into a film that is both jaw-droppingly beautiful and viscerally haunting. It won the prestigious Camera dor award  given for outstanding first directorial feature  at the Cannes festival in 2005. Its available in the US through New Yorker Video, so it should be fairly easy to find either for rental or purchase  pass it up at your peril. Its absolutely one of the most stunning works of cinema Ive seen in the last ten years.",1468540800,,6308,4.708181818181818
8276455,4,B001A8HTY6,"It's an excellent movie although somewhat slow. It's not to be confused with a factual overview on the nature of peace in Sri Lanka. It's merely a story of a family during the so called peace. People who want to get some insight into the various phases of the 30 year civil war incl. a phase of peace had better grab a documentary or a book.

It's a very stylistic film - who says that's the preserve of some directors and not some others - and narrated purely from the point of view of a Sinhala soldier's family. In fact the Tamils, the other major community in Sri Lanka, do not enter the story at all. That's why it should not be confused with a commentary on the ethnic strife in Sri Lanka.

What the director wants to 'say' is ambiguously conveyed. Perhaps this ambiguity is at the heart of things. It's a very ambiguous time - neither war nor peace. The director also makes use of very specific devices like a folk tale to situate a particular point in the film.

It's a deeply moving film.",1245283200,,997,4.320855614973262
8276456,4,B001A8HTY6,"The storyline and minimal dialogue reveal little about the continuing Sri Lankan violence.  As matter of fact, it is primarily an indulgence in soft pornography. However, the short documentary included on the DVD, ""The Land of Silence,"" is well worth watching.  It alone may justify the cost of the purchase.  This roughly twenty-eight minute film explores the suffering of the soldiers who lost limbs and other body parts in defense of their country from the Liberation Tigers terrorists.  They are unquestionably brave and forward looking.  These soldiers do not wish to be victims---but masters of their destiny.",1226620800,,615,5.298969072164948
