647495,3,6303398480,"For a movie that gets one thinking about ""where did we come from"", this one does a good job.  From the opening theme music to the final closing, this movie keeps one engaged.
James Spader's portrayal of  the ""geeky nerd"" is excellent.  I can't imagine anyone else doing  that role.
Kurt Russell ""overdid"" things in his role.  While he  did a good job as a burned-out Air Force Colonel ""in mourning"", I  think he could've ""toned down"" things a bit.  I also think the  overt ""anti-gun"" theme in his role was a bit much, similar to the  overt ""anti-smoking"" theme in the observatory crash scene in  ""Deep Impact"".  Quite frankly, I tire of todays movies being  propaganda machines for ""Political Correctness"" and similar  drivel.
The effects are top-notch, especially the ""Stargate  travel"" scenes.  Coupled with a very loud soundtrack (not irritating,  mind you - just slightly ""overdone"") gives my Home Theater system  a good workout.
All in all, this is a great ""Saturday Afternoon  Movie-fest"" entry.
I have BOTH the Laserdisc and DVD of this movie  (I received the DVD as a Christmas present) and I have to say the DVD  ""has the edge"" in picture clarity AND soundtrack quality.  There  are ""things you don't hear"" with the Laserdisc soundtrack that  you hear on the DVD soundtrack, specifically in the area of  ""background noise"".  Otherwise, if you already have the  Laserdisc, you don't have to run out and get the DVD.
Finally, the DVD I  have is a ""flip-disc"".  I understand this was one of the FIRST  DVDs to be released.  However, I'm dismayed I have to flip it like the  Laserdisc.  Oh well, one can't ""always have everything"", right?",921974400,,1643,4.753571428571429
647496,4,6303398480,"I've heard many disapointing opinions of the DVD transfer from the original (you really have to turn the disc over, ugh!) and for that reason and one other, I won't' buy the DVD. But what about the Special Edition  with the extra scenes? It's available on VHS. Anyone know if there are  plans to transfer this verison to DVD and get it right this time?",921628800,,352,4.4
647497,5,6303398480,"The new ""Stargate"" certainly is incredible. Even though some of the edited scenes are questionable as to why they were removed, they make the movie better. The beginning is totally altered, revealing the truth  behind the stargate. Also it is only available in the widescreen  format...that's a definite plus!!!",920332800,,311,5.326530612244898
647498,4,6303398480,"This is a very good movie. It mixes aspects of ancient earth mysteries (Eygpt) to the future and distant planets.  The characters are well done from Kurt Russels messed up commando routine to the rest.  The settings of the stories are well done. One might wonder how a desert terrain can be fun to look at, but the director did a superb job of including monuments and sites ...besides, the desert is sort of a character in the movie itself. Though the story is far fetched (ancient egyptians  taken to a distant planet to be slaves), the movie is a lot of fun top watch.  If you want a good movie with no brain teasing plots, this is for you.  END",901929600,,647,4.31404958677686

647770,5,6303398480,"This is just a classic science fiction movie. Sometimes you just have to grab some popcorn and settle in with some friends to watch it again. The effects are incredible for the time this was made, James Spader, Kurt Russel, and Jai chew up the scenes between them. Beautiful scenery, imagery... just plain fun.",1521331200,2,310,4.7592592592592595
647771,3,6303398480,"The rare Roland Emmerich film that isn't brainless, effects-over-story mayhem. Well, not completely, anyway. It does carry a lot of the director's favorite themes, from the tortured genius who only needs the chance to prove himself to the war-hungry soldier on a suicide mission, the overbearing government suits and the eccentric, ignored true believers. Those over-simplifications are glaring, of course, but at least there's an effort put in to expand certain characters beyond their stereotype (Kurt Russell's lingering resentment of guns, for example) and the plot itself is rich and interesting enough to paper over most of the holes. I've always had an affinity for science fiction and Egyptian history, so any merger of the two was bound to hit a sweet spot for me, and in this case the marriage works shockingly well. There's a certain other-worldliness about the pyramids, and that particular culture's system of beliefs, which lends itself well to such genre-driven filmmaking. The practical special effects come off wonderfully - gigantic hovering spacecraft and robotic Anubis-helmed enforcers - but it was still a bit early to rely on CG for this type of work and the few instances where they tried don't hold up very well. Despite a phoned-in leading performance by James Spader, Stargate remains a quirky, unexpectedly engaging ride. Still fresh, unique and interesting as it approaches its twenty-fifth anniversary.",1520985600,,1432,5.34070796460177

647993,5,6303398480,"If You buy this Opening movie to this Series Beware that it's like peanuts. You'll automatically get the 'Urge' to purchase all of the rest of the Series. When you do this too, I 'Suggest' that You purchase entire sets (SG-1 & Stargate Atlantis) at once rather than sections by the seasons. This way You'll get all of the segments rather than having some left out. This first movie is necessary to the overall enjoyment later on as there are segments that refer back to this one.. Additionally, also purchase the 'Continuum & Ark of Truth' separate movies as they both fit into the story line of SG-1 toward its end.

After Stargate Atlantis comes Stargate Evolution for two seasons before the Series was discontinued. I found that these two seasons were a complete Waste of money and really have little to do with the first two series.",1509580800,3,836,4.648648648648648

647996,5,6303398480,"Evidently some customers were disappointed with the Blu-ray transfer ordered at this page(?) but my experience was superb, so here's hoping my tip helps others. At this page, I selected:  Multi-Format (Oct 28, 2014), 20th Anniversary Edition.  This transfer combines the theatrical release, an extended cut, and a generous helping of documentary extras onto a single Blu-ray disc. I'll confess I was concerned, thinking they must have compromised quality to squeeze all that content onto one disc, but frankly I was pretty blown away by the output.  Highly impressive visually on a 55 inch HD screen, and the DTS-HD Master Audio also sounds spectacular in my 5.1 setup.  Results were consistent with published reviews which rate this edition highly for video/audio integrity.

It's difficult for buyers when the product page combines reviews for multiple versions - how can you tell which version is going to be great for you?  So I'm being very specific, to help prospective buyers.  Hope my tip is helpful to you as a fan.",1509148800,16,1024,5.059523809523809

648252,1,6303398480,"Review for Digital HD version only:

If you read all the details on Amazon, there is no mention what format the ""Digital HD"" copy will be in.  It's ULTRAVIOLET via VUDU only, which requires FLASH plugin on desktop browsers.  RUN, NOW.  Not worth it.

I have been buying discs with digital copies since they began, and this is the first one that would ONLY be available via Vudu.  If Ultraviolet wasn't bad enough, it won't let you choose Flixster like every other title I have redeemed on UV, only Vudu.

Not bad enough?  We bought in 2017, and the UV redemption code said ""may not work after 2015"".  It did work, but we had to make a Vudu account, then link the UV account, then we need Flash (google Flash player and security), so we still can't watch it.

648971,5,6303398480,"this is the movie that started it all for the Stargate franchise and it's 3 TV series. and while the movie builds a little slowly it still is a good watch, but the series Stargate SG-1, Stargate: Atlantis and Stargate:Universe series are all in my opinion some of the greatest science fiction shows ever made by a US studio.

but as i said the original movie we are talking about (With Kurt Russel as the lead) starts out slow, but would keep most sci-fi fans interested all the way through with the whole ""traveling to another planet story line"" all in all a good movie that gave us 3 great tv shows and plenty of action, adventure and comedy, but i must say that while this is a good movie, but the TV shows are better",1470268800,,720,4.294117647058823

I couldn't tell you how this version differs from previous versions, all I know is that this one was cheaper than other versions, so cost was the primary reason for purchasing this after I decided I wanted to ""own"" a copy.

ORIGINAL REVIEW
For fans of Stargate (the series) having the movie which started the whole thing is worthwhile. This DVD plays well on all of our TV sets (480i, 720p and 1080p). The sound is very good as well. We use a 7.1 system on 2 of the 3 sets in the house and it's very good. Plus this was price right. It was nice to see how it all began again.

I hope the Stargate adventure continues. It's been too long.",1470009600,,662,4.2047244094488185

Gloriously filmed, a cast of ""thousands,"" with just the right amount of twist and edginess to the plot. It must have cost a fortune to make with sets and costumes years ahead of its time. On the cutting edge of computer enhanced effects, this is the one science fiction movie that still stands up against Starwars 22 years later.",1469750400,,492,4.72093023255814

An archaeologist decode some hieroglyphics that eventually lead to his taking the Stargate tour of another world where they meet up with some bad guys.

649544,5,6303398480,"One of the better and more outstanding science fiction action adventure movie - tv franchises out there.  I thoroughly enjoyed both this movie, and the unedited sequel ""Children of the Gods"" even though that one does not have Kurt Russell in it.

Basic premise: Outcasted super intelligent young Egyptologist James Spader is summoned by a secretive US government officer to help the Air Force (Kurt Russell & his team of Airmen and Soldiers) explore a new alien technology first exposed to the ancient Egyptians.

 These heroes go through this time travel space teleporter and find themselves on a lost alien planet for an adventure of the a life time.

 If one were to take elements from ""Indiana Jones"", ""Star Trek"", ""Star Wars"", and ""Commando"" you get certain themes from this movie.

 The Showtime channel sequel ""Children of the Gods"" is almost as good but they changed the actors, (get the uncensored and unedited original version & not this highly cut politically correct version out now if you want the real adventure film) They censored the sequel but really neither of these movies or tv episodes are for young kids anyway, (possibly 12 & above).

 This franchise certainly was enjoyable at it's height, even though it is a bit dated.  One of the better movies of the 90's bar none.  A+",1445644800,,1296,4.840909090909091

649812,5,6303398480,"Stargate is a very decent sci-fi movie. ""What if"" there was an apparatus that would allow a person to move from one location to another by walking forward? ""What if"" the Ancient Egyptians really were alien lifeforms who had come to Earth?

Stargate has a great cast starting with Kurt Russell in an oh, so comfortable role of soldier. Russell has played so many soldiers over the years that this is no stretch. It's as if he was sliding into his afternoon, ""I'm done with work"" clothes. Jaye Davidson's performance as Ra was splendid. Coming off the superb portrayal of Dil in Crying Game, Davidson was definitely in the mood to work.

As a movie, this was intriguing. Don't get caught up in the costuming and make up, although for the most part, that was very good as well. The concept of the movie, the very thought that thousands of years ago these people were on Earth, that's mind boggling.

But wait it looks like someone is interested in his cryptology abilities. Catherine Langford (Viveca Lindfors) had a secret that her daddy found years ago. Her secret will change the life of Daniel and Col. Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell). Turns out that they will have a mission that will take them on a sojourn to the other end of the known universe. We go with them. What will we find and will we be able to bet back?

650169,5,6303398480,"One of my all time favorite movies, though I admit I like the TV Series better I think. This movie and Independence Day are two movie from this decade, 1990's, that I watch over and over and over... okay so you get the picture. I can never tire of this movie. Except that my VCR has finally given up the ghost, I would be able to watch it more often. I probably wore out my copy by rewinding it over and over.... don't know what a VCR is, ask your parents ;-) Unless you hate sci-fi movies, James Spader fans will love this movie. This is where my love of the actor began. If you're a Stargate fan, this is the movie that started the franchise so you need to watch it at least once even if you like the series better.
As to movie series comparisons it's hard to do. Richard Dean Anderson is by far the better O'Neill - 2 L's, no offence to Russell. As for Michael Shanks' Daniel, for me it was hard going from watching the movie ad infinitum to seeing a different face in the role of who at that time was my favorite actor. The first few episodes - if not the first season - was hard to bear as Shanks tried too hard to mimic Spader. Once he found his own voice as Daniel, that's when he began to shine. Spader brings something unique to his role as Daniel, and later in the series - especially after season seven - Shanks does as well. Now, I love them both for different reasons.",1418428800,,1381,4.118518518518519

But Kurt Russell did a wonderful job was the O'Neil Character he portrayed a man broken and on the brink of suicide very well my hat goes off to Mr. Russell he is a wonderful actor.

I know that this was written by a different writer and well before the SG1 Series but it is just another take on the complicated O'Neil character before he rejoins the Air Force again to fight the good fight.",1413244800,,808,4.212903225806452

Sometimes when you continue on from a movie making it into a TV series and change actors who portray the main character or characters it ruins the flow. In this case it didn't ruin it.

This creates difficulty for the Stargate Teams because they must learn to communicate. Unfortunately the TV series didn't stick with this level of realism. In the TV series everyone they meet speaks English which is lame to say the least. At least in Star Trek or Dr Who, the writers made up an unseen translation device to explain how they are able to speak to aliens, (although how that would work with an alien race they have never met before is left up to you.)

My favorite sci fi movie, and Stargate SG-1, and Stargate Atlantis are my favorite TV shows of all time. I can watch them again and again. Every few years, I watch the Stargate movie and the other movies released after the tv shows.

When I watched Stargate this time, I thought about how James Spader and Michael Shanks look so much alike.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: STARGATE is Roland Emmerichs very entertaining sci-fi adventure, begins in 1928 at the foot of the Great Pyramids, where archaeologists have unearthed an enormous ring-shaped artefact covered with strange markings. Immediately the scene shifts to the present, where experts are still baffled by exactly what it is theyve dug up. When a mysterious artefact is unearthed at Giza, tough-minded military man Colonel Jack O'Neill clashes with archaeologist Daniel Jackson over the origin and potential of the object. When Jackson identifies the object as a portal to another world, O'Neill leads him and a team through the STARGATE. They are transported millions of light years from Earth where they are stranded on a strange and alien planet. When Ra, the enigmatic ruler of this extraordinary world, discovers that the doorway to Earth can be reopened, he devises a deadly plot. Racing against time, Army Col. Jack O'Neil [Kurt Russell] and Daniel Jackson [James Spader] must overcome Ra if they are to save Earth and find a way back home...

By this time the ring has been transported to an underground military site in the United States. In an act of desperation, the researchers bring in Daniel Jackson [James Spader], a brilliant Egyptologist whos radical and some say insane theories have alienated him from the intellectual mainstream. In short order, Daniel Jackson determines that the ring is actually a sort of map of the heavens that, if properly calibrated, becomes a doorway for instant travel to the far reaches of the universe.

STARGATE which was written by Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, holds our attention through a combination of suspense and funky wit. The latter is supplied primarily by James Spader and the truth about Daniel Jackson is that hes a little daft, which makes him a great character for James Spader. Slowly but surely, James Spader is emerging as one of the most accomplished, watchable actors in the films. With his shaggy hair drooping over his brow, he plays Daniel Jackson as a bumbling egghead lost in his own thoughts.

STARGATE [1994] is a sci-fi film which follows the typical hero's journey style narrative. Here we follow Daniel Jackson as he is thrust into another world after he is brought on board a secret military operation to decipher symbols on a mysterious object that allows travel from one planet to another. When we first meet Jackson he's an outsider on the fringes of academia. His theories are debunked by every serious scientist and he's just about broke. He's approached by a mysterious group who want to employ his services as a translator of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. But what he unearths his far beyond his wildest theories.

Not only does James Spaders comic spin carry us through the first half of the film, it also provides a neat counterpoint to the heavy seriousness of Kurt Russell, who is saddled with the thankless role of Col. Jack ONeil, the military officer overseeing the project for the government. After Daniel Jackson has deciphered the symbols on the STARGATE, he joins a reconnaissance team that walks through it to the other side of the galaxy. The group, led by Army Col. Jack O'Neil [Kurt Russell], emerges in a desert environment similar to that of Egypt but peopled by a multitude of primitive slaves who mine a precious metal for their master, Ra.

Once on the other side of the STARGATE, ONeil and his team discover that Daniel cant get them back again. And while they remain stranded, the movie is too, even though the new planet provides some science fiction excitement. The effects conjured up by Peter Mitchell Rubin and Patrick Tatopoulosincluding a wonderful lumbering creature that looks to be part elephant and part yak,are inventive, often even thrilling. And as the god Ra, Jaye Davidson is perfectly otherworldly especially when hes angry, the whites of his eyes glow like headlights.

But with nowhere to go, Roland Emmerich treads water with a budding love affair between Daniel and a beautiful slave girl named Shauri [Mili Avital] and a trifling plot in which Ra attempts to send a bomb back through the gate to destroy the Earth. Though James Spaders character dominates the first half of the film, he seems to get lost in the second and even when the character is on screen. By the end, the films early promise has pretty much degenerated into routine pyrotechnics.

Its hard to say that Roland Emmerichs directing is somehow better than subsequent previous work; in fact it may be just the same. I think the reason why STARGATE has quality epic performance. The battle scenes in the sand are filled to the brim with total excitement; the special effects are creatively done and integrated quite well without shooting on green screen, worrying about everything around the actors later. All aspects of this film needed to be carefully thought out and orchestrated exactingly, allowing all performers something real to act against; Kurt Russell is perfect as the tough guy with a capacity for compassion and James Spader is full on neurotic eccentric, the odd leading man type he perfected in the 1990s. The rest of the cast consists of familiar faces like John Diehl, Leon Rippy, French Stewart trying way too hard to be badass, and an early Djimon Hounsou and effective parts from the foreigners in Alexis Cruzs son-like Skaara and Mili Avitals love interest Shauri. Even Jaye Davidsons Ra, despite his youthful appearance, holds the kind of malicious ego necessary to fear him. Both Kurt Russell and James Spader are amiable enough as the mismatched explorers and the special effects are well up to scratch. Most importantly, there's a sense in which, while it may be ridiculously far-fetched, suspension of disbelief is just about possible as it swings along with a committed gusto rarely seen since the heyday of George Lucas.

Blu-ray Video Quality  STARGATE finally received the high-definition upgrade fans deserve and has a stunning 1080p defined encoded image and an equally stunning 2.40:1 aspect ratio. First and foremost, the colouring problems that plagued the prior version have been corrected this time around, removing the ""hot"" skin tones, and artificial brightness boosting. On this version, we have a natural colour scheme that accurately reproduces the spectrum of the source material, creating a highly appealing experience. Rounding out the positives, black levels possess incredible depth despite the sun-drenched hues of the desert setting, and contrast offers excellent differentiation through the majority of scenes and only slipping occasionally during dark, indoor shots. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Not to be outdone by the visual upgrade, the audio experience on STARGATE offers an equally impressive experience. The 7.1 DTS-HD HR Master Audio employs a robust sound design that contains a relentless mix of effects and music to create an epic feel. From the booming voices of Ra's bodyguards to the high-pitched wail of the futuristic planes soaring overhead, the audio mix is never bashful in making demands of every speaker throughout your room. There is totally excellent surround separation, lots of clarity and balance in the various elements of the track, the dominant portion of your subwoofer gives a much-needed workout through the multiple explosions, sandstorms and rumbling undertones of the musical score.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Directors Commentary with Roland Emmerich [Writer/Director] and Dean Devlin [Writer/Producer] [Extended Cut only] This is the same commentary track as featured on a number of previous versions of the film, but it's the first time I've heard it. Surprisingly it's not actually a bad track, although there are quite a few extended periods of dead air. However, when Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin do talk, they provide a lot of pertinent information about the technical side of the project, along with plenty of cast and crew anecdotes. They are also very keen to point out that they had no involvement whatsoever with the STARGATE TV series!

Special Feature: STARGATE  History Made [2009] [1080p] [2.40:1 / 1.85:1] [22:18] This feature is divided up into 3 category headings, that comprises of the following: Deciphering The Gate: Concepts & Casting; Opening The Gate: The Making of STARGATE and Passing The Gate: The Legacy. Contributing to this new special feature are the following: Roland Emmerich [Director/Writer]; Dean Devlin [Writer/Producer]; Mili Avital [Shauri]; Stuart Tyson Smith [Egyptological Consultant]; Eric Avari [Kasuf]; Patrick Tatopoulos [Creature Effects Supervisor] and Frank Gerney [Stargate Fan]. In this first section, Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin recall developing the script together and securing financing from foreign sources after being turned down by every American studio, now doesnt that sound typical and familiar? They also talk about their casting choices, some of which had to be pursued and Kurt Russell turned them down repeatedly. There are a few seconds of interesting footage of Jaye Davidson speaking the Egyptian dialogue in an undubbed voice that will sound truly odd to anyone used to hearing the electronically manipulated voice of Ra in the finished film. Roland Emmerich looks genuinely thrilled that people still tell him they like the film. And any true fan of the film should be able to guess what question Eric Avari is asked the most, which he kindly gives the answer as well.

Special Feature: The Making of STARGATE Documentary [2001] [480i] [1.33:1] [52:00] This French made documentary, which was luckily filmed in English, was organised according to specific elements of the film, e.g., the STARGATE, the desert, the so-called mastadge creature the travellers encounter on the planet, the pyramid structure, etc., and how they were achieved. Perhaps the most entertaining participant is visual effects supervisor Jeffrey Okun, who seems to take an almost child-like delight in the things that go wrong. Contributing to this 2001 special are the following: Joel B. Michaels [Co-producer]; Kurt Russell [Actor]; Joseph Porro [Chief Costumier]; Roland Emmerich [Ralisteur and Co-scnariste]; Dean Devlin [Co-scnariste and Co-prolucteur]; James Spader [Actor]; Mili Avital [Actress]; Jeffrey Okun [Responsible des Effets Spciaux Numriques]; Peter Mitchel Rubin [Graphiste and Storyboarder]; Patrick Talopoulos [En Charge de Cratures]; Andy Armstrong [Regleur des Casades]; Docteur Stuart Smith [gyptologue]; Antoine Bonsorte [Responable des Bas-reliefs] and Peter Murton [Directur Artisque].

Special Feature: Is There A STARGATE? [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [12:10] With this feature we have Erich von Dniken [Author of Chariots of the Gods], with a brief overview of his theories. The documentary footage of various phenomena claimed by Erich von Dniken as evidence of prehistoric visits by extra-terrestrials is entertaining. Whether it convinces anyone is a different question. We also get a contribution from Giorgio Tsoukalos [Editor in Chief of Legendary Times]. Narrated by Gene Ross. It was an Artisan Home Entertainment presentation.

Special Feature: Original STARGATE Previews [1994] [480i] [1.33:1] [17:18] You get to view 5 separate Preview Promotional vignettes. But sadly most of it is repeated information about the film STARGATE.

Special Feature: B-Roll footage [2001] [480i] [1.33:1] [6:02] This is random piece of filming, especially views of behind-the-scenes of filming STARGATE. There is no commentary, but in the background you get to hear the main theme music of STARGATE.

Special Feature: Never-Before-Seen Gag Reel [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [3:12] Shot in one long extended take that is supposedly entitled a parody reel, and who ever thought up this ludicrous title, should be sacked. Here you get to see a lot of not so funny choreographed idiots making a fool of themselves and sadly features appearances by Kurt Russell, Roland Emmerich, physical effects supervisor Kit West and dozens of other crew, and it parodies numerous familiar moments from STARGATE to the accompaniment of the all-too-familiar soundtrack. At the end of this rubbish, we get to see the wording COMING SOON TO A THEATRE NEAR YOU, well I hope not, as it is the most stupid idiotic thing I have seen in a very long time and it is not at all funny and complete was of celluloid film and again it is not at all funny.

Special Feature: Picture-in-Picture STARGATE Ultimate Knowledge [1994] [1080p] [2.40:1] [130 minutes] Mario Kassar presents a Le Studio Canal + / Centropolis Film Production in Association with Carolco Pictures Inc. Exploiting the Blu-rays advanced capabilities, this feature allows the viewer to play the extended cut with a PIP at the lower right containing both interview and on-set footage. Much of the interview footage appears to date from the films production. Also, a substantial portion of the material is recycled from the documentaries and features provided as separate extras.

Theatrical Trailer [1994] [1080i] [1.85:1] 2:38] This is the films Original Theatrical Trailerbut one thing I do not understand why they could not instead included the 2.40:1 aspect ratio Theatrical Trailer.

BD-Live: This Blu-ray Disc uses the Blu-ray formats online function [BD-Live] to access additional dynamicHD content. Please make sure that your Blu-ray Player is connected to the Internet and latest player firmware is installed. It also asks you whether you would like to continue, with either Yes or No.

Finally, STARGATE is one of those sci-fi films that I have watched first the inferior NTSC DVD and now this wonderful Blu-ray disc thatI care to admit, and it is up there at the top of my sci-fi favourites list, especially as I do enjoy its novel twist on the origins of the ancient Egyptian civilisation. Fans of the film may well be wondering why they should stump up for yet another video copy of this film, but if you want the best possible audio-visual presentation then there really is no alternative. Fans have waited a long time for a really good version of STARGATE, but the wait is finally over. Will this be the last time the film gets released on disc? If you haven't seen STARGATE, and you do not have a fleeting interest in science fiction, please give it a try and get this Ultimate Edition Blu-ray disc, as it is well worth purchasing and I am so glad it has been now been added to my Kurt Russell Collection. The only thing that really ages this sci-fi film is Kurt Russell's hair and the CGI effects which now look a little rough around the edges, but were cutting edge in their time; otherwise this is a totally timeless sci-fi classic. Highly Recommended!

I've loved this movie since the day I saw it in the theater in the 90's; especially the unique plot about an alien entering a boys body and making humans serve and worship him as a god. Such a very intriguing concept. While the ancient Egyptian pyramids, as well as their legend of who built them, is in certain conspiratorial circles relevant today.

To the Blu-ray whiners:
Please stop reviewing a movie and giving it the worst rating possible because you bought the wrong Disc version. We know it's a great movie but I don't want to see all the whining on Amazon, because of the bad choices of a few.",1382400000,,630,4.478260869565218

James Spader is such a wonderful actor, and he's even more awesome in his latest NBC series The Blacklist. While I'm unsure whether Kurt Russell's heart was in this project, the film delivers on many levels, and sets the future stage for ten seasons of Stargate on TV. One of my Top Ten favorite films, for sure.",1382054400,,642,4.640350877192983

650867,1,6303398480,"I watched this movie last night with my ten year old son. We both groaned, and his taste in film isn't even, err, developed.  I don't have the energy to describe how surprisingly bad it is so I'll borrow some quotes and passages from other reviews that hit home:

""What might have been an interesting sci-fi about the origins of the pyramids and civilization as a whole is a clumsly, plodding mess filled with two-dimensional characters, nonsensical plot machinations, and cheesy f/x. It's also needlessly long.  * * *I guess there are a lot of people out there who eat crumbs and think it's a meal. This movie wishes it were crumbs. It's more like carpet sweepings and broken glass.""

Clich-riddled story line that would make a ten-year-old groan - must have been written by xeroxing pages at random from every other third-rate sci-fi script over the past twenty years. * * * The utter and complete lack of originality is truly breathtaking.""

""Everything about this film is poor; the directing is poor, the scriptwriting is poor, the acting is bad, the music is awful. There are so many faults in this movie I couldn't possibly list them all, but here are a few of the worst things about the film. The actions and situations of the people are so unrealistic it is laughable (I thought Spielberg was the master of this but this director takes it to an all-time low). We have the most important discovery in the history of mankind and it's left in the hands of a bunch of people who you wouldn't even trust to cook your dinner for you. They send in a bunch of Marines who are like a group of 10 year-old boys on their first scouting expedition, led by Kurt Russell who walks around like a John Wayne on Mogadon. The James Spader character is an imbecile who can't even talk without getting flustered and somehow he manages to decipher the hieroglyphics that the experts have been working on for years as soon as he walks into the room. It's rife with cliches and stereotypes, the first ten shots of Kurt Russell has him lighting up and taking a puff of a cigarette (no it doesn't make you look tough !) and the female elderly lady speaks in her fake foreign accent, stares when she speaks and smirks to herself like she knows everything about everything - it's absolutely cringeworthy. The plagiarisms are also too many to name, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, the Time Machine, they're all here. The music is loud, constant, overused and so irritating its almost unbearable to watch. The shameful thing is, that underneath it all lies the potential of a really good film. The egyptian connections and the idea of a porthole to another place in the universe was a concept of great promise. Sadly the makers of this film obliterated any hope of anything worthwhile coming out of it. The director and producer are largely to blame, the acting is bad but even Al Pacino would not have saved this film.""",1381536000,,2893,4.609708737864078

650919,1,6303398480,"The movie stinks on a fundamental level.  It's ""John Carter"" before ""John Carter"" was even made.  What might have been an interesting sci-fi about the origins of the pyramids and civilization as a whole is a clumsly, plodding mess filled with two-dimensional characters, nonsensical plot machinations, and cheesy f/x.  It's also needlessly long.  How this spawned sequels and a tv show, I'll never understand but I guess there are a lot of people out there who eat crumbs and think it's a meal.

650920,2,6303398480,"Few films leave me feeling as dumb as `Stargate' does.  What is really funny about this film is that even as a young kid, who was obsessed with all things science fiction and action centered, I was bored to tears by this overwrought yet surprisingly underdeveloped mess.  Some films try way too hard to think everything through that they wind up making absolutely no sense, and `Stargate' falls into that line.  Considering that the acting and actual storyline fail to be anything close to compelling (Jaye Davidson in his second and last film role again steals the show, but to a lesser effect), the film winds up being nothing more than an exercise in visual effects and over the top costume design.  In that instance, it works (eye candy to the extreme), but at the end of the day this is a forgettable flick and a complete bafflement to me.

651170,1,6303398480,"Clich-riddled story line that would make a ten-year-old groan - must have been written by xeroxing pages at random from every other third-rate sci-fi script over the past twenty years. George Lucas should sue these people, not just for so shamelessly ripping off Indiana Jones, but for doing such a embarrassingly awful job of it. The utter and complete lack of originality is truly breathtaking. How they managed to get good actors, as well as considerable special effects dollars to cobble together this insult to your intelligence is beyond me.",1378944000,,547,5.088888888888889

651172,5,6303398480,I'm a science fiction fan no doubt. I found the movie to be very entertaining and given the time frame when it was shot I found it within the realm of possibility. I was very pleased. I liked the actors and I thought the plot was pretty genuine. However I never did understand the anger directed at the professor. by the military unit. That almost ruined the film.,1378857600,,364,4.367647058823529

651176,5,6303398480,"Great movie with lots of action and a great cast selection. Always been a fan of Kurt Russell in action films and he's well casted in this. The TV series that follows never quite did the original film justice, it was good, just too campy.",1378598400,,238,4.311111111111111

If you're like me, and you've seen the shows, you'll love seeing the start of it all. Even if you haven't seen the show(s), it's a great movie! I highly recommend it. If you haven't seen the shows, and you like this movie, definitely check them out!",1378252800,,514,4.03921568627451

651365,4,6303398480,It's a good story and a good lead in to the series in that it lays the ground work to add just enough history and lore to entice.,1377820800,,129,3.642857142857143

651401,4,6303398480,"All over, Stargate was fun to watch. Parts of it were comedic and gave a bright contrast in relation to the dark imagery and secrets the crew discovered. Some of the characterization seemed a bit cardboard, or I would have given the movie a 5. I'd recommend it to people who like sci fi and action adventures.",1377820800,,309,4.43859649122807
651402,5,6303398480,I love this movie and watch it whenever I want that 'feel good' moment. Spader and Russell really nail it on this one and the story is so unique they created a series (2?) from it.,1377820800,,180,4.027777777777778
651403,5,6303398480,The story is fantastic in this original movie.. I'm not a big fan of the next movies or spin-off shows though personally. The characters have a depth of emotion and each has a solid background so you feel like you know them. The alien guy is also sexy.. and I so want one of those healing beds.,1377820800,,294,4.175438596491228
651404,4,6303398480,"I actually watched the movie after having watched the first eight seasons of the Stargate SG-1 show, hoping to gain deeper insight into the mythological connection between ancient Egypt and the Goa'uld empire. I didn't. I knew that Anubis was portrayed in the film and I had hoped to gain some backstory information about his character. I don't see how he was revived in the TV series unless he was already in his state of partial ascension during the movie and as such, was not destroyed along with Ra and the others on Ra's mothership.

 I was also curious about the casting as Jaye Davidson as Ra. I still don't quite understand why he was recruited so heavily for that role. I greatly admire his work as an actor, but I don't really buy him in this role. James Spader is sublime and it's interesting to see his portrayal of the character of Daniel Jackson as compared to Michael Shanks' in the series. Shanks did a fabulous job capturing some of the many nuances of Spader's performance as he effectively portrayed and evolved the character of Jackson. Kurt Russell is, well Kurt Russell--awesome as always.

Alexis Cruz put forth a great performance and his transition from the movie to the TV series is seamless as is Erick Avari as Kasuf. I thought ----'s performance as Kawalski in the series was more memorable than John Diehl's in the movie.

So, wrapping up. It is definitely worth watching, especially for sci-fi fans in general and Stargate SG-1 fans in particular, but the film is not monumental.",1377734400,,1510,4.708333333333333
651405,5,6303398480,Great scifi. Crying Game is great too. It is the movie that launched it all again after Trek. Would be great to see another SG movie.,1377734400,,133,4.153846153846154
651406,4,6303398480,"Solid scifi.  There are plot holes, as in most scifi.  You can look over the plot holes fairly easily, though, because of some decent acting and gorgeous visuals.  Special creature effects are by Patrick Tatopoulos, who you may know as a judge from the first two seasons of Face Off and the director of Underworld: Rise of the Lycans.",1377734400,,334,4.627118644067797

The music isn't bad on it's own, but it reminds me so much of Jurassic Park music (or many other movies of that period) that I found it distracting. The cgi is actually not that bad for the most part. It's lucky the movies doesn't really rely on the cgi to make it good--there are only a few places where the (old) cgi really detracted from the overall experience.",1377216000,,457,4.204545454545454

Ra? seriously? i am sorry but i have a hard time buying anyone being freaked out by the actor who plays Ra. he just is not scary/ all powerful looking. not that Ra needs to be played by ""The Rock"" or something, but having a ""creepy"" voice and magic power gloves just did not make me think he could enslave thousands.",1377129600,,417,4.097560975609756

About the film itself. Very similar to Disney's 2001 animated ""Atlantis: the Lost Empire"", except live action and better special effects of course.

651850,5,6303398480,"James Spader is delightful as the desheveled and wild-eyed egyptologist, Dr. Daniel Jackson, who realizes every academic's dream--and nightmare--that the most deep-pocketed of sponsors, the U.S. Military, turns him loose in a ultra-secret multi-billion dollar playground built to explore what had only been his most far-out of pet theories up to that point!  And now, instead of being ridiculed by his peers for advancing such far out theories--he is the only one able to provide the key to ancient inscriptions that provide the instruction manual for the nearly instantaneous interstellar travel provided by the Stargate!

Spader is the personification of hubristic joy as his character alternately amazes and horrifies his military sponsors with impossibly brilliant insights and shockingly naive assumptions as they embark on their visit to another planet, star system, and galaxy--a mission that seems to have received less planning than a Cub Scout overnight camping trip.  I was especially amused by Jackson's preparation for this quest, which was to toss a few books on Egupt--and a candy bar--into a small suitcase!  Spader's very expressive face lights up with the incandescent joy of discovery as he learns to speak the ancient Egyptian language that had previously been no more than a collection of obscure symbols--and from the lips of a beautiful local girl no less!

Although there is no lack of suspense and drama, the many escapes and evasions perpetrated by Dr. Jackson and his military cohorts, as they evade extraterrestrial bad-guys and pseudo demi-gods, seem almost like something out of the Marx Brothers or Three Stooges.  The only thing lacking would seem to be a little eye poking or cigar wagging as Jackson leaves chief bad guy Ra repeatedly in the lurch!",1374192000,,1782,5.257042253521127

In fact, never had heard of Stargate nor most others that have built great sales records, since I do not watch over-the-air (so to speak) television but do watch DVD versions of some that come to my attention. How did this sample of the current scene strike this alien to it: it was good fun, a remake of a thousand basically similar films made in the last century, with the addition of the material that makes it superficially ""new"". That's not a criticism, just a statement of fact. In films as in most plays, television programs and novels, it's essentially, ""not what you do but the way that you do it"" (as Duke Ellington and pet lyricist told us long ago).

652236,5,6303398480,"If for one reason or another you allow yourself an occasional diversion via ""the arts,"" you might want to pass through the ""STARGATE"" into an adventure filled with unexpected events.  The movie is fairly inoffensive entertainment (at least, I found it so) with some positive aspects that will get your mind off worries for awhile, and maybe you'll be gratified to see the good guys triumph over the bad guys.  The story is science fantasy.  It's depth and meaningfulness are on a par with SuperMan or SpiderMan movies.  It's a blatantly simple good versus evil theme, like in comic books.  But the role of Viveca Lindfors adds some dignity, and one thread of the story has more gratifying depth.

The scenery, costumes, actors, and one animal are quite interesting.  (But I had a good laugh at how much this ""wilderbeast"" appeared to be propelled in some scenes by two people inside an animal costume!  --It was clearly a low-budget film, but was visually successful anyway.)  The plot is implausible and some details run by in rapid dialogue that's difficult to comprehend or grasp rationally, but you wouldn't expect a fantasy-adventure to be plausible.

You'll come away from this movie with a new and entirely novel concept of the Egyptian god Ra.

There are two male leads.  One is a young genius who is a linguist/interpreter with special knowledge of ancient hieroglyphics.  He has a lovely guilelessness, and he's the one whom audiences will feel most affection for.  The other male lead is a scary, angry, steely cold, military commander.  When I first saw him and heard him speak I felt such negative vibes coming from him that I thought, ""I can't stand the bad feelings that this character radiates!  I'm gonna cut off this movie and forget about it!"" I found I was able to bear with those initial extremely uncomfortable moments, though, and kept watching.  Colonel Jack and other members of the little military squad go through some changes before the story ends.  In the long run, I wasn't sorry that I continued to watch Colonel Jack closely, trying to figure out just what was going on inside his mind and heart.  I won't state any explicit details about the story because I think that a lot of the worth of experiencing this film lies in the surprises and unexpectedness in it.

(I thought that the passages between worlds were deliberately depicted as similar in some respects to NDEs, but there was no extended metaphor intended.)

For some people who care to view only super-serious filmatic material, this movie may seem like mostly an ""empty show,"" but I thought it served as a good, worthwhile diversion when that was exactly what I wanted and all that I had mental energy to deal with at the time that I chose to watch it.  I thought it was better than a football game, and better than the Startrek episodes that I occasionally watch for diversion.

I'll remember the innocent-looking, lovable faces of the ""slave people,"" especially the young boys who play significant roles in the plot.  They were beautiful minor characters.

652237,1,6303398480,"I'm a great fan of Sc-Fi and the storyline seemed interesting, so this film must be worth watching I thought - how wrong I was. Everything about this film is poor; the directing is poor, the scriptwriting is poor, the acting is bad, the music is awful. There are so many faults in this movie I couldn't possibly list them all, but here are a few of the worst things about the film. The actions and situations of the people are so unrealistic it is laughable (I thought Spielberg was the master of this but this director takes it to an all-time low). We have the most important discovery in the history of mankind and it's left in the hands of a bunch of people who you wouldn't even trust to cook your dinner for you. They send in a bunch of Marines who are like a group of 10 year-old boys on their first scouting expedition, led by Kurt Russell who walks around like a John Wayne on Mogadon. The James Spader character is an imbecile who can't even talk without getting flustered and somehow he manages to decipher the hieroglyphics that the experts have been working on for years as soon as he walks into the room. It's rife with cliches and stereotypes, the first ten shots of Kurt Russell has him lighting up and taking a puff of a cigarette (no it doesn't make you look tough !) and the female elderly lady speaks in her fake foreign accent, stares when she speaks and smirks to herself like she knows everything about everything - it's absolutely cringeworthy. The plagiarisms are also too many to name, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, the Time Machine, they're all here. The music is loud, constant, overused and so irritating its almost unbearable to watch. The shameful thing is, that underneath it all lies the potential of a really good film. The egyptian connections and the idea of a porthole to another place in the universe was a concept of great promise. Sadly the makers of this film obliterated any hope of anything worthwhile coming out of it.

652455,4,6303398480,"Another one of those I heard about for many years but finally got around to seeing just today. I will attempt to make something resembling sense out of this amazing plot line.

In ancient times, something was buried in the sands of Egypt. In the 1920s, an archeologist (with his little daughter along for the adventure) uncovered a huge ring of metal unlike anything else known to man. So in the 1990s, Dr. Daniel Jackson (played by a very cute James Spader), was offered a super-secret job inside a decomissioned missile silo in the Colorado mountains. Actually inside the mountains, apparently. This huge ring has been set up there, and the project to figure out what it is and what it is used for is being headed up by the now elderly daughter of the archeologist that found it all those years ago.

Actually, Dr. Jackson is needed as one of the rare few who might be able to decipher the symbols on the ring which are not Egyptian hieroglyphics. There are hieroglyphics on the stone which had covered the ring, and I think on the outer edge of the ring, but the ones on the ring itself are alien. Literally, as it turns out. Jackson is able to translate the hieroglyphics and recognize that what the thing is really is a star gate: a portal into somewhere else altogether.

A robot probe is sent through and reports back that the conditions on the other side are fit for humans. A group of soldiers and Dr. Jackson are thus detailed to go through and find out what lies on the other side.

What they find, predictably, is a civilization which resembles ancient Egypt in many ways, ruled by an alien who uses human bodies, the most recent one of which greatly resembles my former room-mate who is also a Multiply user. (But her voice was a great deal nicer and her temper was a little less caustic.) I'm pretty sure she has seen this movie and I wonder if she agrees about the resemblance.

Anyway, there are many hazards to the soldiers being able to return to the earth, including problems on both sides. To detail them would ruin the story for you. But let me ask you this: what would you get if you crossed a camel with a bison?

It's good fun, a rousing adventure, and I recommend it. The only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5 is that I kept looking for something rather more profound in the way of denouement. Still, real good fun.",1336867200,,2340,4.442890442890443
652456,5,6303398480,"I bought this from Amazon but I do not think it was the Ultimate Edition.

This is, hands down, a great film. Lots of action and sci-fi interests. I really like this film.",1334880000,,171,4.181818181818182
652457,3,6303398480,"I haven't seen this movie in a long time.  It's hard to believe it's coming up on being 20 years old, but when I think about it, the last time I saw it, it was during a weekend where we had free HBO or Showtime or something for the week and it was one of the newer movies being featured.  So  yeah, been a while.  However, I do like Sci-Fi and I found the Extended Cut Blu Ray for a whopping five bucks at Target and couldn't resist.

Being so long, I didn't remember the particulars of the movie very well, so it was almost like seeing it for the first time.  It's a movie that takes the idea that the Egyptians weren't worshipping gods after all, but a race of space aliens that were using them as slave labor.  Eventually, the humans became too strong and the aliens, led by Ra, took off; but not before leaving an artifact to be found thousands of years later.  That would be the Stargate, of course.  Which opens a portal through space to distant galaxies.  After recruiting a young floppy haired James Spader to help them unravel the mystery of the Stargate, a team is led by Kurt Russell (at his square jawed, high and tight haircut early 90s toughest) through the Gate to find out what's on the other side.  What they find is a race not unlike the early Egyptians, being used by Ra and his forces as slave labor once again.

I love the idea behind this movie.  The execution of that idea is good, but I think could have been a lot better.  As it is, it's an entertaining piece of sci-fi with a decent archeological mystery and action that moves along nicely and hits all the notes it's required to.  It just seems as though they didn't reach the potential that the set-up of the movie promised.  The story is of the classic mold of a group of soldiers teaming up with a primitive race to fend off their technologically superior evil overlords set in a sci-fi mold.  For the time period, the special effects are very good and I actually think they hold up pretty well.  I actually didn't think there was as much FX as you would expect in a movie like this, which isn't really a bad thing.

In a movie like this, there are leaps of logic that must be made to make the story work and it's a credit to the movie that I took those leaps without much grumbling.  The one thing the movie asked me to do, though, that I simply could not was to take French Stewart seriously as a hard nosed soldier.  Couldn't do it.  Sorry.  Hearing tough guy snarky dialog coming from the Squinty Eyed One was just one leap too many.  Also, Hollywood once again doesn't disappoint with it's obvious love affair with the name Jack.  In this movie, we have Russell's character named Jack and Spader's last name Jackson.  Subtle, Hollywood, subtle.

Those quibbles aside, it really is an entertaining movie with Spader doing good with the role type that would be taken over by Jeff Goldblum in Emmerich/Devlin's ""Independence Day"", and I really liked Kurt Russell as Jack O'Neil.  You wanted to like him, because Kurt Russell is just so darn awesome, but he was a character with flaws and layers and maybe he didn't have the best of intentions, but Kurt was good at giving you windows of the sympathetic side of O'Neil.  As with others, I can't speak highly enough of David Arnold's score.  I miss big scores in movies with recognizable themes.  This might be one of the best movie scores ever, if only for the main theme.  I loved it.  Basically, what we're dealing with here is just a fun action/sci-fi flick that asks you to go along for the ride and have a good time with it, and I enjoyed it for that.  It's just a shame that I felt it could have been so much more.

The blu-ray side of things, though... that's another story.  I got it cheap, so I can't complain too much.  The movie just doesn't pop like other blu-ray releases do.  I can't compare it to the DVD release, as I never saw it, so I don't know how much of an upgrade it is, but the picture just doesn't blow me away.  The menu is kind of awkward.  When I go to, say, scene select, the disc does this weird pause thing that briefly takes you back to the main menu screen as it resets the background music before sending you back to the screen select menu.  Weird.  Also, I didn't realize until after I was done that you had to have subtitles on to see the subtitles when the aliens were talking.  I went through the movie thinking that was maybe just a stylistic choice by the filmmakers, yet still felt like I was missing some plot.  Now I know why.

Still, for the price I paid for it, I don't regret the purchase.  It's a bit of a questionable blu-ray, but it's a fun enough movie that its worth owning.  I say 3 stars with the shoddy blu-ray issues, 3.5 stars for the flick.",1334188800,4,4728,4.30237825594564

This is the movie that started it all, and a must-see if you are contemplating starting the series, which starts two years after the events of this movie.  We did so because we have teenage children who like to watch a family show on Sunday nights with dinner.  We try to select a show that will entertain everyone, and this certainly did (despite some limited nudity to which we had to yell ""shut your eyes"" - it was a surprise, and that is why I am warning you now - don't have your kids watch this ultimate edition without knowing about the brief nudity - and yes, there is violence too).  We watched the first SG-1 episode, everyone liked it but did not understand some of what was going on, so I bought this movie (and we all watched and enjoyed it) and then we went on with the series (which is streaming free with your subscription on Netflix, 1997-2006).  We also watch with the subtitles on to ensure a full understanding of what is being said.

The basic concept of the movie is that an interstellar teleportation device (i.e., a ""Stargate"") that was found in Egypt in 1928 leads to a planet with humans resembling ancient Egyptians who worship the god Ra.  This film is strongly plot-driven.

The audio and music has been remastered and now supports 5.1 Dobly and 6.1 DTS.  Throw in Audio commentary with the Director and Producer, and a small Featurette: ""Is there a Stargate"" and you have quite a nice package.  The remastered movie looks great on my 1080p upscaling DVD player, looking crisp and sounds great!

THE BAD
To use the term ""ultimate"" edition might be pushing it.  I was a little let down over the lack of bloopers/gags and the lack of deleted scenes.  While they did provide an extended cut I just have this feeling there are more scenes left out.  Also the lack of behind the scenes and interviews is a let down; especially when this is supposed to be the ""ultimate"" edition.

OVERALL
Despite missing some bonus features the movie itself is great!  You are getting a remastered, extended version of the film that will look excellent on DVD.  Even with the lack of bonus features this still is the DVD to own for the movie.",1309651200,7,1597,4.613475177304965

I have never watched it before, so I checked it out at our library. I really enjoyed watching it. In fact, after watching this movie, the tv show made more sense. The movie filled in the gaps about why Daniel stayed on Abydos, and why Jack went to that planet, and ended up blowing up RA and his ship. After getting this movie for Christmas, I watched it again. I loved the special features and the commentary too. Those were really good. And the movie itself was very good too. Lots of good special effects, and the acting was very good too. Kurt being a ""veteran actor"" brought a lot to the Jack O'Neil character. I'm still an RDA fan, and I really loved Richard's interpretation of O'Neill. I have to admit, that I agree with Richard.

How did the Egyptians sans modern building equipment and engineering tools build such enduring stone monuments?  How did the Mayan's, or the Cambodians for that matter?  The 1994 movie ""Stargate"", staring Kurt Russell (Backdraft, Forrest Gump, Vanilla Sky) sort of offers up a semi-plausible explanation.

Story-Line

Written and directed by Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, Godzilla, 2012), ""Stargate"" open is mankind's distant past in 3000 BCE to be exact when I spacecraft in the shape of a pyramid visits Earth and stays a spell.  Fast forward to mid-1930's Egyptian desert wherein a stone tablet and huge round disc are found, then fast forward again to the mid-1990's wherein, said stone tablet is being transcribed and applied to the now semi-functioning disc.

But help is needed in the form of one Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader ~ Sex, Lies, & Videotape, 2 Days in the Valley, Secretary) who uses an unorthodox method to transcribe the last of the ancient symbols and effectively kick-start the disc, now called a stargate. As it turns out the stargate is a trans-warp portal to other galaxy's and worlds.  Enter Air Force Colonial Jonathan `Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell) who takes over the project, you know, just in case the scientist succeed.

And succeed they do and off they go to another world where they find the Egyptian sun god Ra (Jayne Davidson ~ The Crying Game), holding sway over a planet not unlike pre-modern earth.

My Thoughts

Even when it was originally released ""Stargate"" was great fun to watch.  No, it was no Star Wars, but then it did not pretend to want to be.  The story, while plausible, was not nearly deep enough to explain what was really going on in the story.  The character were not well written or fleshed out, and the special effect, while cutting edge at the time were still somewhat limited in the imagination department.

Be that as it may ""Stargate"" still managed to live on through no less than three different program arcs, the latest of which Stargate Universe (SG-U) in in its 2nd season on the SyFy Channel.

The Extended version of ""Stargate"" on Blu-ray isn't any better than the DVD, indeed in spots the video was grainy and the audio just so-so almost making me sorry I wasted my time buying the movie.  But overall the experience was enjoyable and if you enjoy all of the extra stuff you get with Blu-ray then the disc is for you.

As a science fiction flick with staying power ""Stargate"" has earned it place as a classic with staying power.  The movie is great fun on a rainy, or snowy weekend afternoon when there is little else to do and a buff Kurt Russell is what you want with you popcorn and hotdogs!",1292457600,,2797,4.753623188405797

652814,4,6303398480,"I have 2 words  JAMES SPADER.  This largely under rated actor's portrayal of Daniel Jackson has created my favorite character anywhere.  Intelligent, disrespected by his colleagues and peers, Dr. Jackson exudes a quiet dignity, secure in his knowledge that he is correct in his theories--but never arrogant or cocky.  I don't know if that was the way he was written or if that is Mr. Spader's spin on him,  but he slays me.  I would do him in 2 seconds. He is a mixture of good looks (GREAT hair), intelligence and perhaps a little bit of nerdiness, but when the going gets tough he can hold his own, shooting aliens and conversing with the locals in their native language.  But the best part for me is that he respects women, in his own way.  When presented with a ""comfort woman"" he immediately declines her ""offer"" and then gets to know her, develops a friendship with her and when it becomes apparent that the society in which they reside consider them ""married"" and she feel badly that he rejected her initially, he is man enough to do something about it.

652850,3,6303398480,"I came to this movie rather late and I haven't watched the TV series. However, I do enjoy science fiction when it's well done so I thought I'd give it a try.

The first part was just fine. It was reminiscent of 'Close Encounters Of The Third Kind', from which it clearly borrowed a couple of ideas. The main characters were well-established, the concept was intriguing and the special effects were realistic enough to allow disbelief to be suspended. Once the voyagers got to the other end of the stargate, the world they found was both inhospitable yet somewhat familiar, enough to make the concept of humans being relocated there not altogether implausible.

The problem is that from there the movie changed. Suddenly the quality of writing and the plot twists dropped to those of a 1950s B-movie. So many cliches were included- the mysterious woman from another planet with whom the hero falls in love, the young rebel reminding the grieving military father of his dead son, the brave peasants revolting against the infinitely superior weapons of the slave masters. Most of all, the cheesy faux-Egyptian villains, totally unbelievable despite a deliciously creepy performance from Jaye Davidson. The fights were hokey and badly staged and although the climax was well-realized, by that time I'd ceased to care.

It's not a bad film overall, but it could have been a lot better. Had the strong writing and concepts of the first part of the movie been kept up, it would have been very good indeed. As it is, it's a three-star movie. Why anyone would give it five stars when movies like 'Close Encounters' and 'Contact' did it so much better, I'm not sure.",1279843200,,1656,4.823943661971831

652905,3,6303398480,"Stargate released in 1994,was a film that was underappreciated by most critics at the time garnering mixed to poor reviews. But the general public liked what they saw and gave out,much to the delight of its' producers,at the box office. The movie went on to influence other subsequent films(such as the opening of the Fifth Element) and spawned video games(direct and indirecty),along with the ever popular TV series franchise.
The film opens with the discovery of a circular device and the fossilized skeleton of a being of some sort,buried in the Egyptian desert in 1928. Fast forward to modern day and a Dr. Jackson(James Spader) who is giving an ill-received lecture on who exactly built the great pyramid in Egypt. Afterwards an elderly woman arrives and invites him to join her at a research facility run by the military in Colorado.
There they have in their hands the device found in the sand and want Jackson to decipher the writing. He does and inadvertantly gives the military brass the code to start up a working replica of the device. The project is headed by Col. O'Neil(Kurt Russell) and he leads a military team along with Dr Jackson through,what is now referred to as,the Stargate. The ""other side"" is light years from earth and is a planet much like the Egyptian desert,complete with their emergence point in a similarly structered building,dwarfed from behind by a huge pyramid.
In due time they find a colony of human slaves who are mining the material that composes the Stargate. Dr Jackson slowly but surely learns the language and eventually finds the key that will enable the team to return to Earth. But in the meantime the beings who oversee all this,return and wreak havoc with Col. O'Neil and company. It is learned that the aliens have taken humans as hosts and actually are the ones responsible for creating civilization on Earth thousands of years before. But the alien leader informs them they should never have opened the Stargate and plans to send back a bomb to destroy the Earth. In a race against time,an uprising by the slaves and a ticking bomb that can't be turned off,O'Neil and Jackson narrowly manage to turn the tables on the aliens as they try to escape and thus destroy them. Dr Jackson stays behind while the remaining team members return to earth. The movie ends as O'Neil says to Jackson that he will ""see him around"".
This left the movie up for an obvious sequel but,much to my disappointment,none has ever been forthcoming despite numerous rumours to the contrary. The latest rumour is that once the TV series has finally finished then we will see a sequel;but that remains to be seen.
Russells' career at the time had been a mixed one up Stargate having had more hits in the 80s(The Thing,Escape from New York,Used Cars,Big Trouble in Little China)with little of substance/success after,other than a notable supporting role in the hit Backdraft in/91. Spader on the other hand had been a pretty hot property at this time(his most popular time in fact) having had a more consistent string of recent successes(Mannequin,Pretty in Pink,Wall Street,Sex,Lies and Videotapes)than the more established Russell. That is why both share top lead. However while Spader had the lions share of screen time,Russell manages to dominate every scene he is in which says much  about his acting chops.
The story generally flows well but the action gets bogged down on sideplots concerning the slaves working for the aliens. All concerned do a wonderful job but it is the (then)unique concept and angle this film gives us that really manages to fascinate and ultimately sell it. It must have made an impression,for while we have yet to see any sequels at the theatres,there has been a wildly successful little screen franchise going on for years.
This so called ""Directors Cut"" is clocked in,on the sleeve at least,as 119 minutes. Well the ACTUAL screen time is just over 123 minutes,with the credits extending it to around 130 minutes! Underselling their product.
The sleeve also tells us that this film has been remastered. Well I think someone needs to do some more work on this. The picture can get slightly washed out and grainy at times;not what a ""remastered"" print should look like. The sound however is very good,available in Dolby 2,5.1 and 6.1 DTS.The ""ultimate"" features are just an audio commentary by the director and producer and a small 10 minute film on the concept of alien vistors in ancient times and its'conceptual ""father"" Erich Von Daniken. Not much for an""ultimate edition"",so it loses marks there also. The film is in its' original widescreen format. The copy I received of this film is a bit different than the one shown here for sale. The DVD I got is in a case with the same artwork as depicted(brown colour with the ring over the pyramid).However THAT case,in turn,has a nice looking sleeve over IT;a colourful holographic version of the case cover. I hope yours comes this way also.
In the end this film still holds up quite nicely after 15 years,both in the acting and concept departments. And while the film does needs a proper tweaking on the remastering,overall I think you will still enjoy what you see.",1258502400,2,5169,4.853907134767837
652906,5,6303398480,"I have always been a big fan of the film. They also did a lot of good things with the TV series as well, but they still couldn't measure up to the film. One of the reasons why the film is better than SG-1 is the actors. Kurt Russell and James Spader were always one of my favorite actors out there. Richard Dean Anderson and Michal Shanks are good too, but they couldn't measure up to Russell and Spader. Also there are a lot of continuity errors in SG-1 and Atlantis considering they were supposed to be continuations of the film.

The Plot:
A dig at Giza uncovers a large metallic thousand-year-old ring... the Stargate! Professor Danial Jackson (James Spader) is called into to decode the symbols on it. He does so, and opens a doorway to a lost planet on the other side of the universe. Colonel Jack O'Niel (Kurt Russell) leads a team through the Stargate to the distant planet where they encounter a replica of the Great Pyramid, an enslaved humanoid race, and a powerful evil alien posing as the Egyptian Sun God, Ra. Now its a race against time not only to save the human civilization on the planet, but to save Earth as well!

An epic action-packed film with a great story, great special effects, and great acting and directing. This is a great buy. And if you've only seen the TV series, then see where the story began with this film. Highly recommended!

P.S.
Buy the Special Edition which includes both the original theatrical version as well as the extended cut.",1258329600,,1474,4.51310861423221
652907,1,6303398480,"First, the movie, the story, the characters are all wonderful, they get 5 stars.  This Blu-ray, it gets a 1 star (I wish I could give it less).  A common issue with early Blu-ray discs seems to be lack of quality and again I find this to be the case here.  The color, graininess and ""WIDESCREEN"" on this Blu-ray are all a joke.  Talking to the people who did the work on this Blu-ray; if you're going to transfer garbage then all you're going to get is 1080p, hi-def garbage!  Whoever did the work on this Blu-ray release does not know what they are doing and most likely did not care.  The skin tones go from just OK to bright pink and even orange (we're talking skin tones that would make an Oompa-loompa jealous).  The transfer is also dark, lacking all the great details that the movie is known for, leaving those of us who watch this film with a less than full (forget about ""BEYOUND HIGH DEFINITION"") experience.  The graininess on every version of this film is bad and this Blu-Ray is no exception, it is very distracting.  Then, finally, the ""WIDESCREEN"" part of my review, the back of the Blu-ray tells us that it is 16x9 or 1.85.1 - DUH!  The thing is Blu-ray, of course it is widescreen!  Not to mention that they stretched the whole thing, the people look like they've all been on a mid-evil torture device.
My advice is to stick with the Last relaesed DVD version of the movie and watch it though your Blu-ray player's up-converter feature.  You will end up with a much more enjoyable experience",1256169600,5,1508,4.443636363636363

I examined the BD via my PC and there was no copyright issue at all, which is absurd when you have a BD burner in the system.

 Yes, it is a movie that requires a certain lack of ""reality"" but it is still worth a good look. The sad thing is that the BD featured has 480p video quality and more ""grain"" at higher resolutions than an upconverted DVD.

 Still, if you have a BD player and no copy of this movie in your library, a $10 price tag and a fun ride will be waiting.

Now not the whole transfer is as bad as this, just sections.

I recorded this film from DirecTV's HD-Net movies (or was it MGM-HD?) a few weeks ago and replayed it on my DVR and the same scenes look terrific on the broadcast version so it's definately a problem with the blu-ray transfer.

It ripples then with courage he closes his eyes and puts his face in. The was they did this shot and the way Spader  performed it. It made me feel like I was doing it with him. I guess someday I hope to travel a wormhole or maybe just ride a shuttle to space. Anyway I loved the ride Stargate gave me.

652992,3,6303398480,"""Stargate"" is, obviously, the movie that later spawned the hit ""Stargate SG-1"" TV series, and its spinoffs.

But taken on its own merits, ""Stargate"" is a pretty entertaining blockbuster with some big flaws. It uncomfortably straddles the fence between ""shoot-em-up bombs'n'action"" and ""mythology sci-fi,"" but provides a solid villain, some sketchy writing, and the foundation for a hit TV show. Well, it's definitely far better than your average sci-fi blockbuster.

Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) has just lost his job, when a mysterious old lady invites him to become involved in a secret military project. Soon he finds out why -- a massive stone ring found in Giza decades ago, with strange symbols on a central ring. When they use his calculations, the Air Force is able to open a wormhole to a distant galaxy.

Obviously a recon team is sent through, led by the grieving Colonel O'Neil (Kurt Russell). This new world is a desert planet, inhabited by a race of primitive human slaves who practically worship the strangers. But things turn deadly when a pyramid ship descends on the desert, and a malevolent ""god"" decides to obliterate Earth -- using a nuclear bomb O'Neil brought along.

It's a pretty straightforward action plot -- scientist opens gateway to new planet, bad guy shows up and makes trouble, good guys attack bad guy with the help of plucky natives. ""Stargate"" doesn't add much to the typical formula, but it does dress it up with gilded robes, giant stone statues, glittering starships and sandswept deserts.

In fact, spectacle is what ""Stargate"" excels at -- it has big armies of invading, big ships, big pyramids, and big battles with Ra's warriors. When it comes to gun battles and explosions, Roland Emmerich does a pretty decent job. However, he gets mesmerized by the gilded interior of Ra's starship and the prettyboy alien slinking around -- the middle part of the movie is very slow-moving.

It's more clumsy at the intimate stuff of character development, such as Daniel's serious romance with a chief's daughter, or O'Neil's depression over his son. It just never feels natural or deep. The accompanying dialogue is usually pretty solid, but sometimes gets downright clumsy (""I don't want to die. Your men don't want to die. These people don't want to die. It's a shame you're in such a hurry to"").

Spade pretty much steals the show as a lovable geek who sticks to his guns, even if it makes him a laughingstock. And the geek gets the girl, not the military grunts -- a nice change. Russell is stuck with a rather stiff, humourless military man, although he loosens up in the last lap. And Alexis Cruz, Mili Avital and Erick Avari all get kudos for making the lovable, deep characters come alive without a word of English.

The ultimate edition actually has two different versions of the film: the director's cut and the original theatrical edition, and the transfer is awesome. But the extras are a bit skimpy -- basically you have a handful of featurettes (and one is devoted to aliens and the pyramids!) plus some commentary.

""Stargate"" is a fun movie for the spectacle and slam-bang action scenes, so long as the weak scripting doesn't hold you up. And it served as a good foundation for one of the best ""exploration"" sci-fi series in ages.",1246492800,2,3292,4.874776386404293

653134,3,6303398480,"This is one of my favorite movies. When it first came out in theaters, I saw it multiple times, and I've owned it on VHS, laserdisc, multiple DVD versions, and now this Blu-ray edition. I was excited to see this movie get the Blu-ray treatment, too, until I watched it. While the menus are nice and very well done (other than the same 7 measures of music repeating every 20 seconds), it's quickly obvious the studio just slapped this release together without giving much thought to it.

The first thing I noticed was that it wasn't a very good remastering. The cover says, ""1080p / Beyond High Definition"", but the movie is anything but that. While it is slightly better than the various DVD releases I have, the picture isn't as good as on the laserdisc version. The film was not cleaned up much (if at all), and often had a very grainy look to it, though the blacks (often a problem on DVD releases) were better, with much less anti-aliasing and pixelation going on.

My biggest beef with this release, though, is the lack of any special features other than an audio commentary track and Spanish subtitles. Since they obviously didn't use up all the space for the movie, they should have at least included the special features found on the DVD releases. This kind of movie begs to have ""how we did this"" special features, and it would have been easy to include them as they were already released on the various DVDs.

That said, I still very much enjoy the movie, Stargate (which was incidentally made by many of the same people who went on to do ""Independence Day"").  The acting in it was very good.  James Spader does an excellent job portraying the nerdy archaeologist Daniel Jackson.  Also, Kurt Russell is wonderful as Colonel Jack O'Neil (Richard Dean Anderson fans beware - It's totally different from Anderson's O'Neill.)  The special effects were good, and the scenes (the village, the pyramids, etc.) were beautiful.  David Arnold's musical score to the movie is great, too - much of the music from the movie made it into Stargate SG-1.

The pilot of the TV show is a direct sequel to this movie.  If you like Stargate SG-1, or if you're just a fan of action/adventure or sci-fi movies, this is a great one to add to your collection.",1231718400,,1148,4.610837438423645

And I got this movie for $9.99 which I figure is a few bucks more than the dvd costs right now so it can't hurt. Other than that the movie itself is rather great; I have seen all of SG-1, Atlantis, and the two new Stargate movies but never the original.

The subtitles on the movie are not defective they are just hidden. If you hit your subtitle button a few times I believe track 5 English has the subtitles ONLY for when the aliens talking. The first English track is for subtitles on ALL the time.

I gave this movie 4 stars because I thought they could have done a better job transfering the movie to high-def and they could have figured out that English audio track 1 should have subtitles for the alien language instead of putting it on a separate track... as if any of us speak English AND the alien language to NOT need the subtitles....",1229990400,,1025,4.251282051282051

When the scenes are bright (e.g., in the desert), the picture is excellent. But darker scenes are horrible. Very grainy. I'm not even sure grainy is the right word. There's snow on the picture like I'm receiving it with an antenna and the signal is weak. But then, switch to a brighter scene and we're back to crispy again. I can't figure out what went wrong. Was the original film poor in lower light conditions? I doubt it. Did they transfer from a copy of a copy of a copy? Probably. Regardless, I CANNOT recommend this Blu-Ray for now. Perhaps an ""ultimate"" or ""collector's"" edition will come out so I can buy it a 3rd time and they'll have cleaned it up. Hello? Criterion? Are you there? Somebody get the rights off these Lionsgate boobs.

I understand a lot of companies are doing this - rushing to put out a blu-ray versions with no effort to make good transfers. I'd rather they hadn't issued a Stargate blu-ray at all. I suppose they know I'll buy it again and again, like a lab rat getting repeatedly zapped at an electrified food dispenser.

653421,4,6303398480,"I saw this film in theaters years ago, and just viewed it on BD. The story includes all of the elements that make an interesting sci-fi flick, and it includes a dash of romance. The storyline of the ""passageway"" between dimensions is not unique, but since the film was released several years ago, I would need to say that it still stands up today in terms of relevance.

It manages to be a sci-fi film, while still focusing on the core concept, which is not really laden with special effects, but rather pulls the watcher in with a mind bending concept. Though many scientific explanations of bending time and space are absent, the story still unfolds in an engaging manner. The film did seem a bit long and drawn out in parts, and in comparison with more recent sci-fi flicks, which seem to rely on non-stop action, as opposed to complex storylines, some may find this one a bit ""drawn out"". However, if you are more interested in an interesting film, this one may be for you.

PQ 3.5/5, sound 4/5. Lionsgate is not known for its transfers, but given the age of the film, detail, color and blacks were still rich. For the sake of providing detail, a 50"" Panasonic Plasma and PS3 80 GB was used to view the film, at a 15 ft distance.",1226188800,,1233,4.427312775330397

Daniel Jackson is a different type of Nerd, but 'makes good' in this star-breaking introduction.

Secondly, the commentary is informative, but pretty annoying....(sorry, guys) - I especially didn't like the ""....we had absolutely NOTHING to do with the TV series..."" comment. They didn't elaborate.

The added scenes help to give the viewer a fuller idea of the entire story.  About the extras on the disk, I wish there would have been more, like maybe some ""making of"" footage or interviews with the actors, producers, director, etc.  But I'm not complaining (very few films of that time have many extras when converted to DVD).  The one special extra they do have on the disk more than makes up for the lack of interviews, in my mind.  I don't want to spoil the surprise, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Granted it's an older movie, well over 10 years, but the technology exists now to produce the best-ever transfer of this movie for the new HD formats.

653768,3,6303398480,"""Stargate"" is, obviously, the movie that later spawned the hit ""Stargate SG-1"" TV series, and its spinoffs and side-movies. For that alone, it deserves a pat on the back.

But taken on its own merits, ""Stargate"" is a pretty entertaining blockbuster with some big flaws. It uncomfortably straddles the fence between ""shoot-em-up bombs'n'action"" and ""mythology sci-fi,"" but provides a solid villain, some sketchy writing, and the foundation for a hit TV show. Well, it's definitely far better than your average sci-fi blockbuster.

Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) has just lost his job, when a mysterious old lady invites him to become involved in a secret military project. Soon he finds out why -- a massive stone ring found in Giza decades ago, with strange symbols on a central ring. When they use his calculations, the Air Force is able to open a wormhole to a distant galaxy.

Obviously a recon team is sent through, led by the grieving Colonel O'Neil (Kurt Russell). This new world is a desert planet, inhabited by a race of primitive human slaves who practically worship the strangers. But things turn deadly when a pyramid ship descends on the desert, and a malevolent ""god"" decides to obliterate Earth -- using a nuclear bomb O'Neil brought along.

It's a pretty straightforward action plot -- scientist opens gateway to new planet, bad guy shows up and makes trouble, good guys attack bad guy with the help of plucky natives who don't have a snowball's chance without outisde help. ""Stargate"" doesn't add much to the typical formula, but it does dress it up with gilded robes, massive ruins, ancient aliens, giant stone statues, glittering starships and sandswept deserts.

In fact, spectacle is what ""Stargate"" excels at -- it has big armies of invading, big ships, big pyramids, and big battles with Ra's serpent-headed alien warriors. When it comes to gun battles and explosions, Roland Emmerich does a pretty decent job. However, the director apparently gets mesmerized by the gilded interior of Ra's starship and the prettyboy alien slinking around, because the middle part of the movie is very slow-moving.

It's more clumsy at the intimate stuff of character development, such as Daniel's serious romance with a chief's daughter, or O'Neil's depression over his son. It just never feels natural or deep, no matter how hard the actors try. The accompanying dialogue is usually pretty solid, but sometimes gets downright clumsy (""I don't want to die. Your men don't want to die. These people don't want to die. It's a shame you're in such a hurry to"").

Spade pretty much steals the show as a lovable geek who sticks to his guns, even if it makes him a laughingstock among the rough'n'tough soldiers around him. And the geek gets the girl, not the military grunts -- a nice change. Russell is stuck with a rather stiff, humourless military man, although he loosens up in the last lap (""How ya doin'? Hmm?""). And Alexis Cruz, Mili Avital and Erick Avari all get kudos for making the lovable, deep characters come alive without a word of English being spoken.

""Stargate"" is a fun movie for the spectacle and slam-bang action scenes, so long as the weak scripting doesn't hold you up. And it served as a good foundation for one of the best ""exploration"" sci-fi series in ages.",1184716800,,3299,4.920863309352518

And taken on its own merits, ""Stargate"" is a pretty entertaining blockbuster with some big flaws.

Well, it's definitely far better than your average sci-fi blockbuster.

Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) has just lost his job due to his wacked-out, History Channel-style theories about ancient Egypt. Immediately afterwards, a mysterious old lady invites him to become involved in a secret Air Force project, which somehow involves examining some obscure hieroglyphs. When Daniel figures out what the signs are, the Air Force reluctantly shows him what he's working towards -- a massive stone ring found in Giza decades ago. When they apply his work to the computer controlling the stargate, the Air Force is able to open a wormhole to a distant galaxy.

A recon team is sent through as soon as possible,  led by the grieving Colonel O'Neil (Kurt Russell) and including Daniel so he can (theoretically) get them back to Earth. This new world is a desert planet, inhabited by a race of primitive human slaves who practically worship the strangers. But things turn deadly when a pyramid ship descends on the desert, and a malevolent ""god"" decides to obliterate Earth -- using a nuclear bomb O'Neil brought along.

""Stargate"" is not a terribly complicated story, especially compared to its spinoff material. It has a pretty straightforward action plot -- nerdy scientist opens gateway to distant planet, good guys go to distant planet, bad guy shows up and makes trouble, good guys attack bad guy with the help of plucky natives, one side wins. This movie admittedly doesn't add much to the typical formula, but it does dress it up with gilded robes, giant stone statues, glittering starships and sandswept deserts.

In fact, spectacle is what ""Stargate"" excels at -- it has big armies of invading, big ships, big pyramids, and big battles with Ra's warriors. When it comes to gun battles and explosions, Roland Emmerich does a pretty decent job. However, he gets mesmerized by the gilded interior of Ra's starship and the androgynous alien ""god"" slinking around in elaborate robes. The middle part of the movie is very slow-moving, and it stumbles somewhat at reconciling the guns-and-bombs action movie with the glittering mythological bent of the story.

The character development is a also rather clumsy, particularly when Emmerich strains to deal with serious topics like guilt and the death of a child (""I don't want to die. Your men don't want to die. These people don't want to die. It's a shame you're in such a hurry to""). Daniel's romance with a chief's daughter is rather charming, though, and the interactions with the people of Abydos are more interesting because nobody speaks the same language.

While Daniel is little more than the ""standard nerd"" here, Spader pretty much steals the show as the mild-mannered nerd who finds himself on the adventure of a lifetime. And the geek gets the alien princess, not the military grunts -- a nice change from the typical trope. Russell is stuck with a rather stiff, humourless military man, although he loosens up in the last lap and gets to show some wit and cleverness. And Alexis Cruz, Mili Avital and Erick Avari all get kudos for making the lovable, deep characters come alive without a word of English.

653775,3,6303398480,"First, let me start by saying that I love this movie. Perhaps because I traveled to Egypt when I was 16 and I saw the glory of the giant pyramids in person (just don't tell an Egyptian that it was the aliens who built their pyramids and not their ancestors, he or she will be mad at you forever!).
I also love Sci-Fi flicks, and this movie has a great story. if you haven't seen it and you like Sci-Fi movies, even adventure movies with Kurt Russell, you'll love this one.

Now about the Blu-ray DVD:

Let me say that I have been a happy HD DVD owner for almost a year now, but seeing some the movies that I love in Blu-ray only, made me decide to get a Blu-ray player.

Video: The picture quality of this Blu-ray disc shows excellent CLARITY and BRIGHTNESS and BETTER COLORS that were not on the standard DVD. It seems that the brightness level was boosted, but also at the cost of some graininess and video noise.

The Picture looks almost perfect in the bright sunny desert scenes, but with very visible grains indoors.
Overall, comparing this version to the dark (less grainy SD DVD) is like the difference between Day and Night!
Also, This BD has a cool disc menu with ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic that turn into English letter.

There was a problem with the subtitled translation of the Alien language or ancient Egyptian (I'm not sure if this language was actually made up in Hollywood like the ""KLINGON"" language in the Star Trek Movies). The problem is, the translation should show up in English whenever that language is spoken, but it doesn't!!!!!! One helpful reviewer on this page suggested going to the main menu and selecting English subs, and it works!, but you end up with subtitles throughout the whole movie. This release might have been rushed to the market (like many Blu-ray releases of 2006 in order to compete with the other HD format). How long do we ""Stargate"" fan have to wait again before we get a release with a good picture quality (hopefully grain free and no subtitle problem)????

Audio: very good

Conclusion: I can say that this is the best version of this movie available to date! but it has its problems. If you can't wait and you don't mind turning on the subtitles during the whole movie, it's a great release under $20.",1180483200,79,2260,4.538083538083538
653857,4,6303398480,"The 1990s saw four big science fiction movies.  The two biggest came near the end; Matrix and Phantom Menace.  But the two best came out in the mid 90's; Contact and Stargate.  And of all four, only Stargate spawned its own popular TV show.  The storyline is very innovative; the US military obtains an object that can be used to travel across the universe, a Stargate.  They hire a scientist, Daniel Jackson, to make it work.  Daniel succeeds, and is transported to a desert world (Arizona actually) along with a band of soldiers led by Kurt Russel's character, to search for extraterrestrial life.  They find life, in the form of enslaved humans serving a powerful alien who travels through space in the form of a gigantic pyramid.  Being good Americans, Daniel and the soldiers lead the humans in a rebellion, and the alien is killed by an atomic bomb.

This DVD features a slightly longer version of the movie than the original theatrical release.  The extra scenes come mainly in the beginning, as we see how the alien first came to Earth.  The entire plot is very good and original, with almost nothing copied from any other sci-fi movie.  The link between the pyramids, ancient Egypt, and an alien race made in the movie was quite believable and original. The casting itself was great as all the characters fit their roles perfectly.

The only drawbacks to the movie was some of the scenes were executed poorly.  The first of these occurs early in the movie when we see Professor Daniel Jackson giving a presentation and everyone walking out on him.  I have been to many scientific conferences and scientists never walk out en masse from a peer's presentation if they disagree with the presentation.  Instead, they embarass him in public with pointed questions.  The second really dumb scene occurs right after Daniel figures out the last symbol needed to operate the Stargate.  Immediately, the military sends in a probe, and the next day they send in a team of soldiers with Daniel as their guide.  Astronauts go through years of training before even having a chance to sit in the space shuttle, yet this guy gets to go to another planet after one night!  This was really fake and hokey.  Third, the soldiers sent on this mission are wholly umprepared.  They enter the stargate wearing fatigues and carrying AK-47's!  You would think they would be better prepared for traveling to another world.  How about some survival gear such as bulletproof vests, helmets equipped with oxygen masks, climbing gear, swimming gear, etc...  A fourth hokey scene comes when the soldiers encounter the enslaved humans on the other planet.  One soldier puts a handheld device by some minerals, and states that this mineral is of the same composition as the Stargate, quartz!  This is interesting considering earlier in the movie one character states that the Stargate is made of some unknown mineral.  Big contradiction!  The list goes on and on.

Overall, a good movie, very entertaining with a great storyline.  The only drawback is the numerous editing miscues and flaws.",1180137600,,3066,4.861003861003861

There's nothing profound or particularly clever in STARGATE. It's not outstanding in any way. In fact, as the professional reviews above point out, it's pretty hokey. But, if you like this type of hokey scifi adventure, you'll probably like STARGATE, too. As with INDEPENDENCE DAY, the Indiana Jones movies, or the STAR WARS movies, it's just fun to sit back and watch (not to compare it to those flicks, but it's in the same genre). The good guys win and the bad guys get what they deserve when the dust clears. The plot's pretty predictable, but there's lots of action and a few tense moments. Going through the star gate for the first time, not knowing what's on the other side, gives you a little tingle if you haven't seen the movie before.

Kurt Russell does a good job playing the emotionally wounded Jack O'Neil who has been trying to cash in his chips but couldn't really go through with suicide. THIS mission was as good as suicide to him - so he volunteered, never planning to return.

The story is that of an evil ruler who uses humans a slave labor and to propagate his species. He has no compassion for human kind and only wants to be worshipped as a god.

But he isn't a god...just a power-hungry tyrant, a parasite (symbiant) that takes over the body of a human host. He is SO technically advanced, he appears to more primative peoples as a god.

A stargate is found buried in Egypt. They figure out how to use it and travel intrastellarly, happening on some seemingly human people on another planet. The team helps to free them from oppression, an adventure that gets you rooting for the good guys and want the bad guy to be destroyed.

That's what a good versus evil movie is supposed to do. You leave the experience uplifted that good does triumph in the end. The story, the sets, the special effects - are all balanced and interweave well. You feel like you are apart of the story, not watching a movie.

I love the way this movie just gels - that type that a scifi fan just loves. That is why the series has been so successful. Not only did they pull 2 characters from the movie, but they've kept it true to form.

653922,5,6303398480,"Straight up, I love ""Stargate"", and that is why I gave this a 5 star rating. I have been a big fan of the movie for ages and still consider it to be one of the best movies made ever.

In this package, you get both the original theatrical release and the extended version of the movie. I question the use of ""Ultimate"" in the edition description, as the extended version adds very little to the story. In some cases, I agree with the decision to cut the scene from the theatrical release, such as the first scene of the ancient Egyptian lad running towards the huge pyramid ship. While the extras are great, they do not add all that much to the original movie.

The Extra Features, on the other hand, are very interesting and worth a look at. I enjoyed them a lot, almost as much as the movie itself.

""Stargate"" is still one of the science-fiction greats that successfully blends history and science-fiction in one effective plot. It is a great movie with wide appeal, full of action and adventure. It is a bit predictable in some respects, but these are of small concern overall.

This edition is very good for those who have not got a ""Stargate"" DVD, but for those who have already got one, it will add little to your experience of the movie.",1161302400,4,1244,4.395652173913043

Unlike most of the Warner Brothers Blu-ray releases, Lions Gate has taken great care to give you a return on your investment.  Would have been nice to have added some special features.  But this will be one the folks selling the players are using as a demo in the stores.

The movie is your standard science fiction B-movie story with the A+ cinematography.  The only frustrating thing is that for a great deal of the dialogue you are listening to an alien variation on Ancient Egyptian with no subtitles.  And you never completely understand why the bad guys are so upset.

Though I will say one thing about the commentary, it is entirely from the view of the directors. No actors take of a scene or anything, it's mostly the design of the sets, musical score, &etc. Having said that, it's nicely done for what it is.

The movie itself is still as cool as always. While it doesn't have any of the deeper thinking stuff that you find in the series, it does have a few nice plot twists, decent character development, and even a bit of a romantic side. Overall a groovy movie :)",1154649600,,599,4.300884955752212
653985,4,6303398480,"""Stargate"" is fun, pure and simple.  It takes history and science, spins them around in a blender with a cup of fiction, and cranks out a reasonably believable sci-fi classic.  Starring James Spader as a geeky scientist who's really into decoding Egyptian heiroglyphics and a hard-nosed and slightly mentally unstable soldier played by Kurt Russell, ""Stargate"" gives the viewer a couple of things to ponder.  What if ""Ra"" wasn't an actual god worshipped by early Egyptians, but an alien looking for a nice group of simpletons to turn into his slaves?  What if those simpletons began to pick up on Ra's deception and run him off, only to have him gather up a few stragglers and start a slave colony on another planet that's linked to Earth via a ""Stargate?""

All of this sounds a little silly, but deep inside, we all know that there are some reasons to actually entertain the thought that aliens did interact with the ancient Egyptians.  No matter here, it's just used as a backdrop for a wonderful story in which Spader, Russell, and a team of soldiers trek off to the other end of the Stargate in order to see what's there.  When they do get to the other side, they find a colony of people enslaved by Ra.  They're also trying to decipher the gate on their end of the universe in order to get home.  They figure out the entire gate's code almost immediately, except for one symbol, which forces them to interact with the slave colony.  Slowly but surely, they prove to the slaves that Ra can be overthrown and that he isn't an actual god.  Rebellion ensues, and our heroes aid in the battle all the while trying to break the final code.

This is a very fun flick to watch.  It mixes just enough parts history, science, and gee-whiz to make for a wonderful tale.  Along with Russell and Spader, it stars French Stewart (Third Rock From The Sun) as one of Russell's troops and Jaye Davidson as Ra.

Highly recommended to fans of fantasy and sci-fi in general.  The Devlin/Emmerich team hit a homerun with this one before stumbling a bit with ""Independence Day.""  This film is much better and more believable than that flick in my opinion.",1153872000,5,2138,4.58421052631579

It?s never grown old on me,I could watch it a million times. For the plot,see other reviews,I don?t want to be repetitive,just my 2 cents.",1146268800,5,605,4.092436974789916
653992,4,6303398480,"I picked up the ""Ultimate Edition"" DVD because you can't go wrong for $5.99 and because I hadn't seen this movie since it was released in the theater in 1994.

Most people know the premise -- an ancient ""stargate"" is discovered, the military wants to use it for its own purposes, and an unconventional Egyptologist in the style of Graham Hancock is recruited to decipher the strange heiroglyphs on the stargate so the military can open the door to new worlds on the other side. There are obvious plot holes and the pacing of the film lags in the transition between the second and third acts, but those are minor detractions from an otherwise fun experience.

Having seen this movie in the theater as a 14-year-old kid the first time around, I didn't have an appreciation for how odd it really is -- Ra is portrayed as a feminine, egotistical maniac who surrounds himself with scantily-clad children like some sort of ancient Michael Jackson. He talks casually of nuking the entire earth (""You have harnessed the power of the atom ... I created your civilization, now I will destroy it."") while his child-servants give him manicures. All of this is accomplished in an ancient Egyptian dialect spoken by Jaye Davidson in his last role. And it works, not only because of the great acting, stunning costumes and amazing sets, but because it is so bizarre.

Buried under the action sequences and impressive visuals -- which include a lot of really cool modern interpretations of Egyptian art -- is a plot that shows people believing in an all-powerful deity, only to discover he's not actually a god and he's not all-powerful. The third act of the movie shows us the consequences of that revelation.

This edition of the DVD also includes an interesting documentary-style look at some of the theories surrounding the Great Pyramid and ancient Egyptian culture, which kind of feels like something that would run on the Discovery Channel on a Sunday afternoon. There's also a commentary track, but be warned -- Roland Emmerich is completely unintelligible no matter how loud you set the volume.",1144627200,8,2087,4.853932584269663

I still only think it's a 3 star movie because there just isn't much to the story anyway, but the low price gives it that extra star.  It's now worth buying to have in your collection.",1142812800,3,619,4.590909090909091

654058,2,6303398480,"Like Aliens and T2, the new footage on this extended edition adds nothing and detracts from the suspense.  Unlike other remasters, however, the picture quality here is off:  too contrasty and saturated, as if the dvd colorist attempted to mold the entire dynamic range of the high res 4:4:4 transfer to the MPEG-2 format.  You just can't do that without making it look wanky in the process.  It must be accepted that you'll lose the subtle highlight texturing on the shoulder and the nuance in the blacks (the foot).  The high frequency picture details also look to have been boosted excessively.  I saw this in the theater, and it just doesn't look natural to my eye on this version.  Dune Special Edition, Matrix Reloaded, The Constant Gardener, The Lover, etc, all look correct to me.  This is the only DVD I have that looks off like this, and it's obviously an attempt to cash in on the ""new edition"" craze fueled by unqualified DVD magazine reviewers who get off on more and more color and contrast to show off their deficient (in those regards) rear projection and plasma TVs.  My Akai TV was calibrated by an Akai-approved projessional as close to the NTSC standard as they could and my DVD playback is through the pro-grade ATI Theater chip on my x800xt All In Wonder VIVO card.  The new special editions also do not include the original version of the film.  Stargate was a real trip in the theater.  It is less entertaining and engaging on later viewings, but I would still like a decent copy of the theatrical edit.  I can't imagine it being very enjoyable if you're a first time viewer and this is what you're stuck with, both in terms of the cut and picture neutrality.  In particular, various new scenes rob you of the shock at seeing those images for the first time later in the film.  You get what you pay for.

Update: After getting the original single-layer 2-sided DVD (the one you have to flip), I'm giving up on trying to find a proper edition of Stargate.  The original is non-anamorphic letterbox.  The Special Edition is non-anamorphic letterbox (as far as I can tell), though that one does have both versions of the film using branching on a single DVD.  The Pioneer version appears to be the best in terms of visual quality and is anamorphic, but unfortunately (isn't it always?) that one is region 2 and PAL.  If it was region free I might get it since my computer can do fair PAL-NTSC conversion for my TV, and if I eventually get a DLP projector it's not an issue at all (no conversion needed).  But I don't think ATI MMC will do very many playbacks of other regions.  I'm not sure, though.  I'll have to check on that.  What a drag this is just trying to find a good copy of the theatrical cut.

Another Update: I ordered the Pioneer European PAL edition after hacking my DVD Burner's firmware to region-free.  A review will follow.",1139961600,4,2862,4.551859099804306
654059,3,6303398480,"STARGATE SG-1 and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER have one major thing in common:  both are highly successful television series based on far less successful television series.  STARGATE the movie had a fine initial premise for a Sci-Fi film, but it is a premise that actually lends itself more towards a television series.  The central idea is that a series of Stargates established by ancient aliens with a parasitic involvement with the human race, which they have enslaved and use as hosts, points more towards a serial narrative than a stand-alone narrative.  The very existence of a variety of Stargates establishes this.  This is one of those instances where a film has been reborn as a vastly more successful television series.

Considered entirely on its own, however, this is not a terribly successful film.  It suffers from multiple problems, though it also has a few successes.  In the plus column goes the overall concept, the excellent performance by James Spader as Daniel Jackson, many of the sets and much of the art design, and the wonderful score.  The negatives are, unfortunately, more numerous.  I like Kurt Russell and have always regretted that he has not been in more major productions, but his incredibly wooden performance here creates a major energy drag on the film.  I understand that he is playing burnt out case, but I don't think the attempt was very successful.  He was a leaden in this one as he was in SOLDIER, where he played a futuristic soldier that had had all his emotions programmed out.  Another serious casting problem was the use of Jaye Davidson in the role of Ra.  Davidson was amazingly effective in THE CRYING GAME as a transsexual, but he simply does not have the screen presence to be an effective film villain.  He is also an extremely tiny person (around 5'3) and his lack of stature necessitated his not being filmed very often in the same frame as the other actors.  He simply did not manage to come across as a sufficiently menacing presence.

By far the biggest problem with the film is the narrative.  The film works fine at first in laying out the existence of the Stargate and in showing Daniel Jackson at work in figuring out how it works, but once that is done the plot becomes fairly trite, as if they had come up with a premise but didn't really care what story they hung upon it.  As a result the second half of the film simply isn't very interesting.  To make matters worse, the final hour is poorly paced and directed.  In other words, the second half of the film told an uninteresting story badly.

Still, if one plans on watching the television series--and if one enjoys Sci-Fi I strongly encourage it--then seeing this movie is recommended.  It helps to know where the series came from.  It also explains the relationship between Daniel Jackson and Sha're as well as O'Neill and Jackson to Skaara.  But even on its own, while not a good film, it is not an out and out bad one.",1137542400,,2938,4.669260700389105
654060,5,6303398480,"Many science fiction films are fairly predictable in either premise or action. This one is not. It is very original and enjoyable.

An ancient Egyptian artifact seems to hold some tantalizing clues to an alien civilization. The pentagon has been trying to unravel these clues for decades but their progress is slow and halting until they enlist the aide of a maverick Egyptologist who quickly deciphers the needed clues. Suddenly, the artifact becomes the stargate, a portal to another planet. A team is sent to investigate and finds a colony of humans serving as slaves to mad Egyptian god. They must fight in order to free the slaves, protect themselves and protect the earth.

The effects and costumes in this one really add to the sense of wonder. They are at once modernistic and evocative of ancient Egypt. The ""science"" is a bit hokey but the story is a good one and it is well told. Kurt Russell comes off well as the veteran colonel who leads the expedition and James Spader does an excellent job as the inept scientist.

There is no reason for this film to be top ranked in anything except that it is immensely enjoyable and it sticks in the memory.",1135728000,3,1159,4.64390243902439
654061,4,6303398480,"Did extraterrestial travellers visit Egypt long before the time of the Pharoahs' and construct the pyramids using a form of technology beyond our understanding even by todays standards? Is history as we know it based on wrong assumptions and misinterpretations of the historical record? Or better yet, has the real history of the planet Earth been willfully and purposely hidden from us by those who don't want us to know the truth?

Stargate asks you to challenge some of those basic assumptions and simply sit back and enjoy a cosmic adventure transporting a renegade Egyptologist and a band of military personnal across the universe via an alien device known as a 'Stargate.' This small band of explorers instantaneously arrive on a distant planet where they will not only discover a civilization much like what once existed on ancient Earth, but the forgotten origin of man's belief in heavenly powers and those beings of myth and legend that were worshipped as Gods.

James Spader is perfect as Daniel Jackson, the brilliant Eygptologist with the cutting edge theories as is Kurt Russell as Colonel Jack O'Neil, the emotionally dead but duty bound commandeer in charge of the expedition. Also great performances from Jay Davidson as the Sun God, Ra and the very attractive Mili Avital as Sha'uri. Everything works in this sci-fi extravaganza; cinematography and special effects are first rate as is the screenplay.

Throughly enjoyable from beginning to end and it will leave you with something to think about and maybe explore on your own concerning some of the unorthodox beliefs circulating around today concerning man's past and destiny.

654062,4,6303398480,"Director Roland Emmerich has been largely been known as being an action-film director rather than an ""auteur"". In the same camp as Michael Bay, they make films that are not supposed to have big personal investments or even good dialogue, they're for pure entertainment value, nothing more. Before they blew up the White House in Independence Day, ruined Godzilla and froze New York, they did Stargate, an intriguing sci-fi movie which unfortunately doesn't have the greatest transfer.

It's 1928 and scientists in Egypt have discovered a big artifact. Flash forward to present day and scientist Daniel Jackson gets hired to decipher the artifact, a big stone tablet with markings. Taking 2 weeks he figures it out, it's a ""stargate"" which has the power to zip to a point in space. Also uncovered with the tablet is the actual stargate which they then open(in probably my favorite water effect since the Abyss' water tentacle) and step through.

On the other side, it's actually very reminiscent of ancient Egypt. They find a tribe of people who are governed by the Sun God Ra, who's looking for immortality(aren't they all?). Things get complicated when the US orders that if there's a threat that they blow up the Stargate. But of course Ra finds the bomb and coupled with the mineral he uses the tribe to mine it has an even bigger destructive power than normal. So it's basically stop Ra, save the tribe, and save Earth. Sheesh, you think aliens would attack some other planet for once.

It's interesting that a sci-fi movie is actually very modern looking. Besides the technology, it's very low-key. There's no big spaceships a-la Independence Day, big weaponry like Star Wars or odd creatures like Alien. That's part of its charm: it's sci-fi but it's got a bit of a distinctiveness, even though the plot isn't exactly new. You could replace the galaxy travel with time travel and you're in the same ballpark.

If there's one thing that's unfortunate is that the transfer is still not that good. This is the 3rd iteration of Stargate on dvd and there's still problems. For one, on occasion I noticed the image got slightly grainy. Another was there was some specks on the image, like black lines. Overall this is a better transfer than the last 2 but there's still problems.

Another is that there's very little features. There's a commentary and there's a featurette. Boom, that's it. Kind of like Terminator 2's DVD, one contains a great transfer but very little features while the previous one contained a boatload of features but not the greatest transfer.

Similar to Firefly/Serenity which mixed traditional/modern themes with sci-fi, Stargate is an underrated film that while it does have problems here and there, it's still an enjoyable film and since it's Roland, he's pretty much succeeded.

654107,4,6303398480,"In 1968, a man named Erich von Dniken wrote the book ""Chariots of the Gods"" in which he proposed the idea that the pyramids of ancient Egypt may have been built by extraterrestrial aliens and not by ancient humans.  Though few Egyptologists gave any credence to Mr. von Dniken's idea, his concept may have inspired Roland Emmerich to direct a very entertaining sci-fi film in 1994 that was entitled ""Stargate"" that he also co-wrote with Dean Devlin.

The film begins in the early part of the twentieth century on the Giza Plateau in Egypt where archeologists uncover a very unusual object: a large circular stone with never-before-seen symbols engraved upon it.  Beneath the circular stone was an even more puzzling object: a circular wheel with the same unknown symbols engraved throughout its circumference.  One of the archeologist's daughters, a teenaged girl named Catherine Langford (Kelly Vint) finds a gold necklace with a pendant that contains an etching of the eye of the Egyptian god Ra, which she keeps.  The film then moves back into the present where a eccentric language expert named Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is attempting to give a presentation to a less-than-receptive audience.  As the members of the audience leave shortly after he begun his presentation, an older woman waits towards the back of the room to speak with him.  The woman is Catherine Langford (played by Viveca Lindfors, 1920-1995), who had earned a Ph. D. of her own, and presents Dr. Jackson with an interesting proposal to make some much-needed money to translate some mysterious symbols.  He accepts the offer and is whisked away by the U.S. military to an underground military base in Colorado.  There, Dr. Jackson quickly impresses everyone by successfully translating a message written in ancient Egyptian that contains the mysterious name ""stargate"".  He is then presented with the large circular cover stone and given the task of translating the symbols.  At first, he has no idea what the symbols are, but upon seeing some zodiacal star drawings from a newspaper, Dr. Jackson quickly realizes that the mysterious symbols represent star constellations.  Apparently, other Ph. D.'s that include Barbara Shore (Rae Allen) and Gary Meyers (Richard Kind), had already figured out the same thing; but they were missing the translation of one particular symbol and they needed a total of seven.  Since the project was controlled by the U.S. military and required top secret security clearance, Dr. Jackson had no knowledge of the actual stargate's existence, but had already understood from the cornerstone that a total of seven symbols were required to travel: six that identify the destination and one that identifies the point of origin.  The military commander, Col. Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell), then tells the others to show Dr. Jackson the device and he quickly shows them what they had all been waiting for: the seventh symbol.  Upon entering all seven symbols, which the stargate rotates to lock into place, a massive wormhole resembling a sideways whirlpool is created.  Where the wormhole goes to no one knows, but the U.S. military intends to find out.  However, there's just one problem: who would be able to translate the symbols on the presumed stargate on the other side of the wormhole?  Dr. Jackson says that he can.  With that, he, Col. O'Neil and a group of soldiers venture into the wormhole and emerge on the opposite side of the Universe on an alien planet.  There, they will discover things that had been unknown to humanity for many thousands of years; but what they discover may also be very dangerous.  Will activating the stargate threaten Earth?  If so, can Earth be protected and from what?  Will the travelers even be able to return to Earth at all?  You'll just have to watch this truly imaginative film to find out!

With a combination of good dialog, an interesting plot, a creative way to expound upon ancient mythologies, mostly engaging characters and good special effects, ""Stargate"" is a very entertaining film.  Other important characters in the film include Skaara (Alexis Cruz), Sha'uri (Mili Avital), Lieutenant Kawalsky (John Diehl), Anubis (Carlos Lauchu), 'Good Father' Kasuf (Erick Avari), Nabeh (Gianin Loffler) and the leading alien known as Ra (Jaye Davidson), whom ancient humans thought was a god. The film did fairly well in theaters when it was released in 1994, and the Sci-Fi Channel began production of a TV series based upon the film and named ""Stargate: SG1"" three years later.  In 2004, another TV series based upon the original ""Stargate"" film and the ""Stargate: SG1"" TV series was unveiled on the Sci-Fi Channel and named ""Stargate: Atlantis"".  Both ""Stargate: SG1"" and ""Stargate: Atlantis"" have greatly expanded upon the storyline that was created in this original film that I give an overall rating of 4 out of 5 stars.  Other films that Roland Emmerlich directed include ""Universal Soldier"" (1992) and ""Independence Day"" (1996, which he also co-wrote again with Dean Devlin).",1127260800,9,5045,5.081212121212121

The Egyptian mythology is brought to the forefront of the story when a mysterious large ring is found on a dig in Egypt in 1928. The US Air Force, trying to discover what the device is, enlists the help of Jackson, a foremost expert on Egyptian mythology. Once he discovers how to turn the Stargate on, a strike team is dispatched to the other side of the gate to make a threat assessment. From there the film takes off with action, drama, and mild comedic moments. Jaye Davidson ('The Crying Game') does a great job as the false god Ra.",1125446400,5,748,4.58955223880597
654110,4,6303398480,"This film managed to appear at just the right time.  Capitalizing on the success of the Star Wars films and The Abyss, and foreshadowing Independence Day, it manages to combine our dreams of instantaneous transmission across galactic space with a whole line of modern myths about the visitations of pyramid building aliens.  Hitting just at the right time, it spawned a successful TV series and lingers in the minds of more than a few avid film geeks.

After a quick flashback to an old excavation in Egypt where a gigantic ring like artifact is discovered and then promptly whisked away into secrecy were come to the present and see Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) getting laughed out of an academic conference for insisting that Cheops did not build the great pyramid.  Desolate, Jackson is recruited for a translation job.  Brought to some great subterranean base his challenge is to fine the right set of symbols on that ring, which turns out to be something special - a Stargate.

Kurt Russell plays Jack O'Neil, a suicidally depressed Special Forces commando who will lead the team (Jackson included) through the Stargate when the combination is finally decoded.  Where they find themselves in a pyramid (no surprise there) on a desert planet where humans labor to mine the metal from which the Stargate was made.  This moment of mutual discovery is interrupted by the arrival of the villains in, sure enough, a giant flying pyramid.  A group of aliens took over human bodies millennia ago and has been living forever ever since.

The film is predictable in the extreme - a feel good film with one of those spectacular endings where everything turns out right and the audience yells and whistles with delight.  In other words it's fun, but of the lightweight sort.  Acting is evenly forgettable, but survives having a cast the majority of which talk in an incomprehensible ancient Egyptian dialog.  Jaye Davidson gets a few extra points for making a pretty faced boy look totally evil, but don't look for much in the way of high drama.

Still, I liked it then, and I like it now, especially the hokey Egyptian space furniture and animal headed costumes.  It's silliness in a good cause - something to shake a scepter at.  Don't get fooled too much by the 'Ultimate' thing.  You get a feature on Von Daniken, writer of Chariots of the Gods, and a narrative commentary, all easily skippable.",1125014400,18,2397,4.821515892420538

654113,2,6303398480,"I won't bother with providing a review of the film.  Many people before me have provided many good reviews of the film.  My 'star rating' is for the DVD release only (I really enjoyed the film and would give it 4 stars).  I thought it might be useful to provide a few comparisons on the two DVD versions that are available.  I have the June, 1997 release of the film provided by LIVE Entertainment as well as the new 'Ultimate Edition' released in 2004.

The 1997 DVD version provides a trailer and a teaser for the film; an information section of the cast and crew; audio selection for English or French language; and a choice of English, Spanish, or French subtitles.  The menus are all still (no motion or videos), but are all crisp and easily navigated.  The only real down side of the disc is that it is a 'flippy'... a two-sided disc that you must turn over to resume the film.  Otherwise, The film looks great and contains what I believe is the 'theatrical release' of the film (one place in the packaging lists the film runtime as 119 mins. and in another place it lists it as 122 mins. ??)

The ""Ultimate Edition, Extended Cut Stargate DVD"" released in February, 2004 by Artisan Entertainment is a little different than the version that was released in 1997.  The DVD packaging tells you this is a 119 minute version (same as the 1997 edition), but nowhere on the box does it tell you if this is the ""Special"" edition or the ""Director's Cut"" (per IMDB).  The audio provides three different English language tracks (why only English and why three?).  There is only one subtitle track in Spanish (I guess the French folks are out of luck for this version).  There is a new commentary track by Devlin and Emmerich and a short by Erich von Daniken about his 1960's ""Chariots of the Gods"" theories.  There are no trailers or teasers or cast and crew bios. Overall, the new version was mastered 'lighter' than the earlier work, as though the DVD crew decided the film was too dark and they needed to increase the brightness control.  While this bright effect improved the opening credits, allowing you to see the details of the egyptian mask better than before, overall I found it gave the entire film a washed out, grainy look.  The scene where Doctor Jackson comes out of the hotel before getting into Catherine Langford's car in the pouring rain is so bright it looks like the sun should be out. Some of the effects scenes do not hold up well with the brighter look.  The scene where the Stargate team first see the inhabitants of Abydos for the first time in the long shot seemed to look a lot more 'fake' than in the original version.

So, in all, I was somewhat disappointed in the new ""Ultimate Edition"" DVD.  They really didn't improve upon the original release with extras, they actually took away some of the extras of the earlier version.  I also did not care for the 'brighter' look they gave the film.  To me the colors looked washed out and grainy compared to the earlier release.",1123459200,3,2997,4.523191094619666
654114,4,6303398480,"Do 2005's summer blockbusters bore you? Are you tired of people defending weak, unimaginative retreads as ""popcorn flicks""? Then sit back and enjoy one of the least pretentious and most entertaining science fiction films of the early 1990s.

""Stargate"" is as far-fetched as they come, but it's far-fetched in a good-natured, Flash Gordon style. If you can accept that not only were the Ancient Egyptians actually lorded over by aliens but also that said aliens travelled to and from Earth via a teleportation device known as the ""Stargate"" then you know exactly what to expect from a movie like this. The effects, costumes and action are excellent, coming from a time just before the dominance of computer graphics. The plot moves forward cleanly and neatly in its Marvel Comics-kind of way and more than once the visuals and storytelling will remind you of the mood behind the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy. This is a fun sci-fi movie that doesn't pretend to be anything but a great time.

Above-average characterization is the most important ingredient in ""Stargate."" Sure, James Spader was a bit too young to play the Egyptologist Dr. Jackson but he perfectly captured the idealism and naiviete of an academic out of step with his more experienced colleagues. Kurt Russell was absolutely fantastic as Colonel O'Neill; he gives a performance that is comparable to those John Wayne gave in his best-known films, and even looks a little like Wayne in some scenes. The two characters play well off each other, and we're never asked to swallow an overly warm relationship between the nonconformist Jackson and the career military hero O'Neill.

The central force is the romance that one finds in a place across the Galaxy.
Comparing the Film with TV series is not worth it. The TV series is rightly stated as ""MacGyver Versus the Stargate"", since that is what it is set up to be. The film, however, is a stand-alone masterpiece.
Emmerich and Devlin team up, and produce a film that works on many levels. You can enjoy the many extras on the discs, however, the Von Danikan add-ons are just fluff. The heart of this film is an excellent script. The soul of it lies in the performers, and the performances.
You will probably notice some Emmerich staples, such as some truly superb performers who have appeared in other films by Emmerich and co.

A film about a Colonel (Kurt Russell), hardened by the accidental suicide of his son, who accepts an apparently suicidal mission to another planet by use of a 'Doorway to Heaven'. The mission appears simple on paper.

Enter an academically unpopular Egyptologist (James Spader), who translates the coverstone of the gateway, which other scientists had mistranslated. 'Doorway to Heaven' becomes 'Stargate'.

The two, accompanied by a military team, travel through the Stargate to the planet Abydos, and meet the primitive natives (primitive because an evil alien who had taken the persona of Ra had supressed the Abydonian's academic evolution).

An hour and a half, a couple of deaths-then-revivals, a blossoming relationship and a turn-back from suicide later, the foe is defeated and everyone lives happily ever after.

The fact that it is a wall-shaking, action rollercoaster is very attractive, as well.

I've noticed the TV/movie debate and I'll throw in my 2 cents. I've seen a lot of the TV series and I've never really liked it. I understand that a TV series needs likable, bumbling characters with goofball senses of humor and with a wide range of out-in-the open idiosyncrasies. That's not at all realistic, though, and I prefer the movie's angle. The movie's characters consist of a kickin' squad of serious marine types, similar to the squad in Aliens. Personally, in a movie with military squads, I find that more enjoyable. Maybe the whole TV/movie debate is akin to a geek/jock debate; I don't know. I do know, though, that I find the movie's characters, though more one-dimensional, at least more believable and responsible.

 The story is imaginative but shoots itself in the foot. The aliens in the movie seem far less of a threat than those in the T.V. show. At one point, Ra foils the team's detonation of a tactical nuclear device and, in an ominous voice, threatens the world's leaders by saying ""We have weapons a hundred times more powerful!""

Of course, this film really doesn't have much to do with the actual stargate conspiracy, but it is interesting, nonetheless. Kurt Russell does, believe it or not, an excellent job with his role and manages to balance a powerful character in this film.
Now, for this DVD. Firstly, the DVD is cheap. That's always a plus. However, all the DVD has on it is the movies: I was pretty much expecting there to be what MOST DVD's have (-ie, traliors, interviews, etc)...I was disappointed to find that this edition did not contain any theatrical trailers. There is, however, a short side-film about the Stargate and the prospect of there even being one.",1088553600,3,1146,4.912371134020619

The way it make the Pyramids to have been made by aliens in a convincing way is great, and it doesn't try to expose to much in a short time, knowing that there is going to be a continuation of the story. And the cast... great. Kurt Russell and James Spader are superb together. When i recently heared that the producer and director of the movie wanted to do a trilogy and heard the premise for them, i'm glad they didn't, because the TV show (SG1), has taken the stargate franchise to new heights, and it's more intersting. If you've seen the series, get this to see where it all began. You won't be dissapointed.",1081728000,5,708,4.291044776119403
654342,5,6303398480,"indeed this is probably the best sci-fi movie, personally speaking of course. i've seen it countless times and this special edition includes the way-better director's cut which features more depth and more action. first i'll mention that the actores are all amazing - james spader and jay williamson in particular deliver exceptional performances, especially during their scenes together (i'd even say you can write a queer studies seminar paper on ra's character), and mili avital was an excellent casting choice as well (though too bad she has not gathered much momentum since and mainly does israeli tv nowadays).
dvd-wise the featurettes are great, especially the erich von dniken segment, the director/producer commentary is very very interesting as well just because of the great thought and resources that went into creating this film. i have to say that the reason this is one of the best sci-fi films ever is because it's so well researched, and it doesn't try to make itself simple to understand for the average joe viewer. i've also read the novel adaptation and it's the same case there as well. when you compare this movie to the tripe that's usually being produced when it comes to sci-fi, you can see that there is a clear motivation for everything and even a highly believable scenario - aliens don't just come to earth out of the blue, just like von dniken's book states, there has always been enough 'evidence' on earth to suggest that the ra character exists, that the stargate existed etc.. of course it's all far-fetched but not impossible nonetheless.
finally the musical score in the movie is one of the greatest scores ever so make sure you have your sorround system installed for this movie.",1080432000,6,1716,4.9411764705882355

654344,4,6303398480,"I have to hand it to science fiction; it is one of the few genres that can have mediocre acting and still be a good movie.  Stargate's story is the reason for its success.  The movie tells the story of a race of aliens that used (notice how I did not say built) an interstellar portal, called a Stargate, in order to bring humans to a new planet for slave labor.  This all happened during the time of ancient Egypt, so there is a disticnt Egyptian flavor throughout the film, which I found very intriguing.  In 1928, archeaologists find the Stargate and are baffled by it.  In the present day, the Stargate is in the hands of the United States Air Force, and they hire an Egyptologist named Daniel Jackson (James Spader) to decipher the markings on the gate.  Jackson is somewhat infamous in his field, because he denies that humans built the pyramids.  He believes that it was done by aliens, but he has no proof to back it up.  The Air Force also brings in an old retired colonel, named Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) in order to ""supervise"" the project.  Once Jackson gets the Stargate operational, a team, led by O'Neil and including Jackson for scientific purposes, goes through the gate and ends up on a planet in a galaxy far far away (sorry, I couldn't help myself).  On the planet, they encounter other humans who still speak ancient Egyptian as well as a race of humanoid aliens who are keeping the men as slaves.
The story is very inventive and it is what finally saved the movie for me.  Spader did okay in his role, but Russell seemed to have two modes: angry and sarcastic.  One thing that I didn't understand was that Russell gets top billing, but the movie is essentially about Spader's Jackson.  Also, I didn't like Ra (Jaye Davidson), the leader of the aliens.  He was a good character, but he was so creepy just because he looks so much like a woman!  I could barely look at him it was so disturbing.  But besides these two things, Stargate is a great movie.  The effects are great, and as I have already stated, the story is amazing.",1079136000,,2049,4.450402144772118
654345,4,6303398480,I love this movie. Great action. I also like the whole idea of using myths to come up with bad guys. Very original. The only thing I didn't like was the DVD opitions. No subtitles was only in Spanish. :(,1076112000,,203,4.1
654346,5,6303398480,"The film 'Stargate' is based on an interesting albeit not entirely original premise -- the idea that the ancients have been visited from beings from the stars is as ancient as is humanity; the particular idea for this film probably came from the Erik von Daniken type of UFO conjectures quite in vogue in the 1970s.  In all, it is an intriguing idea, pulling in the mystery of ancient civilisations, the ancient pyramids, the mysticism that underlies all forms of writing, and pictographic/hieroglyphic writing at that, and good old fashioned heroism.
The story begins with a discovery during the golden age of Middle Eastern archaeology, in the early twentieth century.  Drawing on ideas that still circulate today in real academic circles that the pyramids and other structures pre-date the actual historically-recorded empires in Egypt, in the story it turns out the discovery was actually an ancient device that served as a passageway for extraterrestrials who needed mining workers for the resources of this and other planets.
The key to this 'stargate' is embedded in the inscriptions on the device, and Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is the only one who can decipher them.  Jackson is a down-on-his-luck Egyptologist whose out-of-this-world ideas rendered him unemployed and destitute -- the perfect recruit for a secret government mission.
Enter into the scene Colonel O'Neil (Kurt Russell), a depressive, mourning military officer pulled out of retirement to take charge of a near-certain-death mission through the stargate.  The clash between the academics/scientists and the military is a classic story development, but the clash is shortlived here as the team going to the distant planet must work together.
Arriving on the distant planet, they find people and environment similar to that of ancient Egypt, and the whole civilisation has the purpose of mining minerals for their 'god', who turns out to be an extraterrestrial with nearly infinite lifespan and manipulative ways of subduing cultures, primarily by keeping them illiterate and technologically backward.  This 'god' presented himself as 'Ra' to the ancient Egyptians (played here by Jaye Davidson, the ambiguous star of the 'The Crying Game', being the only other film he starred in before opting out of acting).
The action picks up with 'Ra' arriving for a regular shipment, only to find the Earth team ready to begin revolution and destroy the distant stargate with a smuggled nuclear weapon.
The special effects are good if not innovative; the idea of the device and the method of transport is an effective use of special effects technology at hand, and much is carried on the story and the idea of the device rather than the actual computer or miniature effects.  This has proven a boon to the producers, who are able to budget for a weekly series derivative of this film, not something originally planned with the production of this film.
The acting is good, occasionally great.  The perhaps the best character is Viveca Lindfors, who plays the daughter of the original archaeologist who discovered the device; now an elderly woman, her dream comes true of activating the device. Lindfors died the year after this film was made, after a career in acting that spanned over six decades.  Watch closely for French Stewart, as a disgruntled soldier, barely recognisable as the same person who plays on 'Third Rock from the Sun', a very different science fiction idea.
In all, this is a good story, a fine film and it captures the imagination well.  It is not over the top and doesn't overwork the classic science fiction stereotypes.  The special edition contains interesting commentary from the director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin in director's cut, includes the theatrical trailer, includes both director's cut and theatrical cut, and presents things in a widescreen format.",1072742400,10,3865,5.17948717948718

654348,4,6303398480,"I've never seen the TV series that this movie spawned; this is a review of the movie on its own terms.
This movie is _so_ close to being great that it's frustrating not to be able to award it five stars. Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin had a terrific idea here and _almost_ sustained it for the length of a feature film.
The essential idea owes a lot to Robert A. Heinlein's _Tunnel in the Sky_ (and some of the plot details show debts to other Heinlein works as well). There's this stargate, see . . .
Well, that's enough about the plot, just in case you haven't seen it yet. For SF geeks like me, the first hour and a half is like a wet-dream come true. The ending doesn't exactly fall apart or anything, it's just that it doesn't manage to remain at the high level of the first two-thirds of the movie.
As Col. Jack O'Neil, Kurt Russell is terrific as usual (and I happen to think he deserves far more credit as an actor than he's generally gotten). James Spader is a bit hammy but generally credible as Daniel Jackson, the absent-minded academic-outcast astro-Egyptologist dweeb. In lesser hands these two characters could have devolved into cliches, but these actors manage to keep them alive. Of course there's also Jaye Davidson, the special secret surprise from _The Crying Game_, here used very effectively in a role I can't say anything about without spoiling the plot.
David Arnold's soaring score is just awesome. You'll want to plug your DVD player into your sound system for this one (if you don't have it there already).
And the plot is intellectually engaging for at least most of the way through. The, um, foreign culture in question is nicely evoked and fleshed out, with a few cinematic nods to everything from _Dune_ to Indiana Jones to _The Man Who Would Be King_, and without too many of the oversimplifications that always threaten films of this sort.
I have no idea at all how well the TV series has done in sustaining this stuff. But the movie stands quite well on its own.
The _Ultimate_ DVD set includes both a 'director's cut' and the original theaterical-release version -- plus some nice commentaries and interviews. The interviewees include (who else?) Erich von Daniken, whose _Chariots of the Gods?_ was part of the popular literature of my youth. If you've even heard of him, you'll probably like this movie.",1071964800,4,2342,4.645783132530121
654429,4,6303398480,"It is interesting to watch the 1994 ""Stargate"" film from the perspective of the spin-off television series, ""Stargate SG-1,"" which is on its way to becoming the longest running science-fiction series of all-time.  As was the case with ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" we have an okay film that becomes a first-rate television series.
Once upon a time, 1928 to be exact, archeologists discovered a strange disc buried in the sand of Egypt.  The next thing we know we are in the present, and Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader), is having his colleagues walk out on him as he explains his radical theory about the ancient Egyptians and their language.  But then a mysterious old woman (Viveca Lindfors) gives him an invitation to travel to a secret military base buried beneath the Rocky Mountains to do translations.  Jackson has nothing else to do, so he shows up, immediately corrects all the mistakes and figures out all the mysteries, and the next thing we know he is being shown the Stargate.  He then joins a military group led by Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), who has been recalled back to active duty to find out where you go to when you step through the Stargate.  The answer is you go to the other side of the known universe where you discover a desert planet where an alien who was known as Ra (Jaye Davidson) by the ancient Egyptians is lording it over the local humanoids.
This movie is mostly eye candy.  Being shot on a desert planet means that it has lots of scenes shot in bright sunlight, which really is unusual for a science fiction film, where they tend to be dark and murky.  ""Stargate"" brings back the same sort of ideological tension between scientists and the military that we enjoyed during the 1950s with films like ""The Thing From Another World,"" as Jackson is all excited to explore a brave new world and O'Neill is looking for an excuse to blow everything up with the nuke in the big suitcase.
Truth about this movie is that it the ideas are a lot better than than the execution.  The idea of the Stargate is a nice way of circumventing the laws of physics that scoff at warp drive and other narrative necessities to a good space yarn.  It is not a far leap of logic to get from this one Stargate to the idea that there are others, and there is also the nice corrollary that this system explains why there are so many humans scattered throughout the galaxy where they all live on oxygen breathing planets.
Beyond that the television series picks up on the Jackson-O'Neill dyad, reducing it to the idea that one is an academic and the other is a warrior and never the twain shall meet.  Of course Richard Dean Anderson's O'Neill is even quirkier than Spader's Jackson, while Michael Shanks's Jackson starts off even more humorless than Russell's O'Neill.  But it all works, so why quibble?  The original ""Stargate"" ends up being more about style than substance, which is why it is so interesting that the television series could find something substantial upon which to build a television series.
If you have yet to see ""Stargate"" in any version, then you are strongly urged to proceed immediately from this 1994 film to the first season of ""Stargate SG-1.""  Even if you find this film tedious, just get through it and move on to the good stuff.  You could not pass go and head directly for season one of ""Stargate SG-1,"" but you really need to know the players and some of the rules of the game before hand.",1070755200,20,3444,4.604575163398692

654435,4,6303398480,"Others have more than adequately discussed the movie itself - which I love - so I'm going to largely limit this to technical aspects of the 'Ultimate Edition' release.
The Ultimate Edition brings what many (including myself) were waiting for: an anamorphic version of this movie. Unfortunately, the quality of the anamorphic relase is largely wasted on a very poor transfer in this 'remastered' DVD.
Apparently, someone decided that the original film was too dark visually: The problems with this new version are all the result of trying to brighten and lighten the image. The contrast is too high, with some scenes blatantly posterized. Once they lightened the image, they 'pushed' the color saturation very hard to make up for the washed-out quality lightening the image produced. Some scenes are so over saturated that the flesh tones almost 'glow.' The effect is cartoonish at its worst.
Oddly, the theatrical release on disk 2 isn't quite as bad - but the effect is still very noticable. The original non-anamorphic DVD relase has none of these problems and preserves the wonderful subtle colors that this film showed in the theater. But it's not anamorphic...
Another review mentioned the muddled and inconsistent balance of the sound in this version. I agree completely. I was constantly having to adjust the volume, even with the dynamic range compression engaged on my amplifier - which I generally loathe to turn on.
Is this DVD worth it? Depends. The poor quality of the Director's Cut transfer means I probably won't watch it much. The added scenes add little or nothing to the film, so this won't be much of a loss. The Theatrical Release is probably the best balance of anamorphic quality vs. transfer quality, so it's probably worth it to home theater fans who can take advantage of that. The special features are the main reason for fans of the film to purchase this release. If you're neither a videophile nor a rabid fan of the film, save your bucks and buy the Special Edition DVD.",1059782400,5,2000,4.885294117647059
654436,5,6303398480,"Not many films can say that they have spawned a television series. None that I can think of other than Stargate can say they've spawned a series that's lasted as long as Star Trek: The Next Generation. That's a feat in my book!
This film takes the viewer to Egypt where an ancient device is unearthed. The device, the Stargate, has the power to hurtle a traveler to distant parts of the universe almost instantly. A team consisting of Col. Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell), his team of soldiers, and Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader), an Egyptologist go through the gate to explore the world on the other side. They find the planet populated, and learn that not all the beings they meet are friendly.
The action and special effects in this film are first-rate. The actors are all excellent, and play very believable parts. Spader in particular does a very good job playing the geek. Russell, similar to his role in 'Soldier', plays a stone-cold military robot, only so because of extenuating circumstances you'll see in the film.
The special edition DVD is filled with extras such as deleted scenes that have been put back into the film. These scenes add to the overall experience of the film and help the viewer to understand the characters better. I particularly enjoy the 'making of' featurettes.

Jackson, with an escort of soliders led by Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) step through it to the other side.
They find a desert planet where humans are being made to mine for the same material that the gate was made from.
The people are Egyptians who were removed from Earth over 10,000 years ago, by an alien, and even Daniel Jackson can't understand their language because living languages CHANGE.
The movie is careful to stay away from many of the cliches of most sci-fi movies but also stays away from having characters which are TOO simple.  Both Daniel and Jack (played by James and Kurt) are real people, not cardboard cut-outs, with all the flaws and merits of our own reality.  The natives are catch between trying to be friendly towards strangers AND not pissing off their Gods.
The science and technology used by Ra and his men look very sleek and very real.  From the spaceship to the gliders, everything has a touch of old Egyptian myth mixed with advanced alien know-how.
The DVD comes with two versions of the movie, Director's Cut and the theatrical cut, in which the former has audio commentary.  The DVDs also have a great 'Making of Stargate' featurette, a 'Is There a Stargate?' short starring Erich von Daniken himself, trailers, scane access, crew and cast information and production notes.

Once there, they discover a culture much like that of ancient Egypt which is ruled by Ra (Jaye Davidson) who uses his boyish appearance to cover up his alien form.  When the film was released it was roasted by many a critic, but as the dynamic duo of Emmerich and Devlin later proved with Independence Day, it's the box office receipts that matter.

  That having been said I want to talk about the DVD. I found the featurette entitled ""Is there a stargate?"" quite interesting. The two disks for the directors cuts and theatrical cut were a pretty good idea. I really liked that. The only real complaint I have is a big one as far as I'm concerned. It's the audio commentary.
  The commentary tracks are, in my opinion, one of the greatest ideas since home video. Sometimes I decide whether or not to buy a DVD soleley on whether or not they have a commentary track. I really love them, but I swear I'll never listen to this one again. I don't know why they let Roland Emmerich do these things. Every two words are ""like kindof"" he can't go more than 2 sentences without sticking those words in there about ten times each.
  After 5 minutes of listening to this I realized that I'd suffered through one of this guys commentaries before. The Patriot. Another good DVD ruined by this guys endless string of ""like kindof."" Maybe this doesn't bother others as much as it does me, but I know one thing. From now on I'm not only checking to see if a DVD has a commentary track, but I'm gonna make damn sure he's not on it.",1049673600,4,1360,4.251937984496124

There's a spooky documentary in which Erich Von Daniken discusses his ""Chariots of the God's"" theory of extra-terrestrial visitations in ancient times.

654562,5,6303398480,"This review is primarily explaining this Remastered HDTV 16:9 5:1 Dolby digital Ultimate Edition / Directors Cut, 2 DVD Set presentation!!
Artisan is notorious for re-releasing their DVD over & over again each time giving us more fluff in its DVD package (not necessarily the picture or sound quality).
Case in point ""STARGATE - Ulitmate Edition Director's Cut.  This is their 3rd release of ""STARGATE"" and they FINALLY got it right! (what takes Artisan so long to release the movie right???  Never the 1st time (SO BUYER BEWARE)  NOW on their 3rd try they have provided us with a worthy outstanding presentation!!!!
Note: If you are a Home Theatre Owner with HDTV WideScreen 16:9 you must be cautioned about your DVD purchasing.  First WideScreen (Letterbox) DVD's are not going to be true WideScreen on your 16:9 HDTV.  Letterbox means just that - horizontal & vertical black bars around a very small centered WideSceen picture.  Second true WideScreen as this ""STARGATE - Ultimate Edition"" is indeed a true HDTV 16:9 (as noted on the DVD Ultimate Features)picture giving the complete expanded presentation.  Finally remember the only true HDTV WideScreen DVD will be noted on the Extra Features Section as 16:9 WideScreen Enhanced or Anamorphically Enhanced (DVD will automatically adjust to TV size).
""STARGATE"" the movie itself is a scifi classic weaving ancient Eygptian theories with scifi. Brought to us by Erich von Daniken, author of the renowned book ""Chariots of the Gods"".  A very imaginative movie with great screen acting (Kurt Russell & James Spader), outstanding special effects and a very fascinating complex story.
This ""Ulitmate Edition"" is awesome!!  Here is what you get; Newly REmastered 16:9 WideScreen - the picture is absolutely fantastic), A ""DIRECTOR'S CUT"" - additional extended scene footage allowing us to know more about this fascinating world of ""STARGATE"", Original Theatrical Cut - so you get two versions to compare!! (Director's Cut wins hand down), Digtially ReMastered Sound - 6.1 DTS & 5.1 Dolby Digital - Awesome, Featurettes: Is this a STARGATE? - a great explanation of aliens visiting earth etc., The Making of STARGATE - includind never before seen behind the scenes video, Audio Commentary - great backgound information about ""STARGATE"", Production Notes, Cast & Crew Information & Theatrical Trailers.  Wow, what a great DVD package.  Artisan finally gets it right so now I can pass on my old inferior versions to friends so they can at least get a taste of this great scifi epic.

That said, this movie has been given a nice ""touch-up"" or re-release if you will. Making this the perfect movie to own on DVD for the first time after many years of ""selling grapes"". Boasting a DTS-ES 6.1 and Dolby Digital EX 5.1 sound, I'd suggest caution when playing it on your home theater cause chances are, you're gonna blow your roof down. And finally, it's been given a 16x9 anamorphic widescreen transfer, a great news for projectors and widescreen plasma TV owners. As for me, I just can't wait to get a hold of this ""crown jewel"". Stargate truly stands away from the crowd when compared to it's TV series spin-off. This is a great recommendation for those who are yearning for this version since the last time. Two thumbs up!

there if it's not offerd in Dts then there usually will be a huge
much more elaborite version as is in the case with Stargate sure
im curious as to what this film will sound like in full Dts sound
I, mean yeah it's going to be awsome. And is it worth the extra 10
dollars yes because nothing can beat Dts as far as home theatre
sound but why did they not put this version out , Star Trek has
done the same exact thing putting a 2 disk version of there first
four films and Lord Of The Rings is going to do it with all three
films but are doing it with grace and respectibility thinking of
the film and not just a bunch of extra features.
  Stargate is a good movie it is exciting and fun to watch the
journey into the Stargate and James Spader and Kurt Russell are
great as a pairing and the special effects still to this day are
mind blowing but movie companys need to learn that what you put
in your special or ultimate edition is just as important as the
film itself which the only bonus that I, see on this edition is
Dts the other options do not look any diffrent from other special
editions of this type , so what happens when Warner Brothers is
going to bring out The Matrix Reloaded will we have to purchase
The Matrix as a 2 disk format this seems to be now only another
marketing in the similarity that directors have of selling there
film and it does get frustrating if only you could get reimbursed
when you bought the new edition of the film, so in actuality with
this Stargate version instead of getting a cheesburger as you did
before now there giving you a double cheesburger and there hoping
you bite into it.",1043625600,21,1752,4.165191740412979

654648,3,6303398480,"My personal feelings about stargate is that although the premise may not be realistic or believable, what sci-fi movie really is?
Are we so naive to think that an eight foot tall half man / half machine in the name of Darth Vader is realism at it's best?  The folks crying that Stargate is totally out there, are probably not science fiction fans, which I have to say, if you don't enjoy sci-fi, why even bother watching the movie if you already have your mind made up that you won't like it because it's not believable?
I'll admit, when I saw the movie in the theatres, I left thinking it wasn't very good, infact I remember saying to a friend ""that ending was pretty stupid"".
However after becoming a huge fan of the television series during the first episode, I was amazed at how they changed the entire idea of the movie to developing a great series.
After watching the 2nd season, I decided to watch the Stargate movie again, and this time I actually enjoyed it, albeit the action scenes were sometimes over the top, and that corny ending still leaves a slightly bitter taste in my mouth, I still bought the movie on DVD.
This edition is rather poorly transferred, and I would not recommend buying it, however it's still a good movie if you enjoy Stargate: SG-1",1036454400,5,1266,4.504347826086956

However, I'm horribly disapointed with this as a DVD.  The film transfer is terrible;  It has been over-enhanced and sharpened artificially.  The over-processing has destroyed many scenes, causing horrendous aliasing on anything with contrast or fine detail.  There are halos around people (look at any shot outside where someone is against a sky for instance).

654651,4,6303398480,"The director/producer team of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, who gave us Independance Day and Godzilla [ ] first produced this inventive and exciting Sci Fi flick. I'm not usually a fan of this genre, but this one is actually rather good compared with traditional science fiction. Starring Kurt Russell and James Spader, the film is basically a homage (French for ""rip-off"") of the old Sci Fi stories, but there are some interesting ideas and a series of terrific action set-pieces.  The story consists of an Egyptologist who discovers the secret of an ancient relic called the Stargate. The explorer solves the puzzle and then he and a team of soldiers enter the Stargate and discover a city of people who are descendants of the ancient Egyptians. The people worship gods who are actually an alien culture, and then the trouble begins. Great stuff. Dissapointing DVD extras though, with only production notes.

They worship gods (including Ra the Sun God), who in reality, are an alien race. Jaye Davidson (of THE CRYING GAME) gives a stellar performance as Ra. Once our heroes figure out Ra's scheme to destroy Earth, they set out to turn the tables on him. It all adds up to a fascinating film that is visually stunning, and leaves the viewer pondering the possibility that maybe the ancient gods were in fact aliens.

Through his ingenuity and some luck, he solves that mystery of the translation only to find that the object is really a portal to a planet lightyears away.
This is a story of romance, of action and of suspense that created the legacy  and the craze of the Stargate SG-1 series.",1027900800,,513,4.576086956521739
654655,3,6303398480,"This film begins with much promise, establishing the existence of the ""stargate"", an ancient device discovered in Egypt, which could function as the portal to another world, if only the key to its use can be deciphered.  Scientist and linguist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is an eccentric expert in hieroglyphics enlisted into a secret US Government project.  His task, to translate the wring on an ancient stone tablet, the directions how to access the stargate.

Spader is perfect as a sniffling, nearsighted, academic type who seems bewildered at times, by the real world.  His natural brilliance provides the means to get the stargate working.  The first humans to attempt to use the stargate, will be an armed military unit, led by Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell).  They will perform a recon mission at wherever the stargate leads to.  Jackson goes along to make sure they group can return from the other side.  The team heads through the stargate, and pop out through a similar stargate in another world.  They find themselves inside a huge stone pyramid in the middle of a desert.  Jackson can't get the team back to Earth without additional information, so further exploration of the planet becomes necessary, and the party from Earth, eventually discovers a band of less advanced desert dwellers.
All this is fine, rather credible and interesting.  The interaction and learning process between the two peoples is naturally awkward.  Where things start to go off track is when the supernatural element is introduced.  ""Ra"" the ancient Egyptian sun god, is turned into an alien, in order to facilitate a ""battle for the planet"".  The charm and warmth begins to fade, and the story morphs into something we've seen before.  An interesting and provocative concept just goes to waste, and James Spader's excellent performance is somewhat obscured by his dubious transition from bookworm to fighter.  Stargate misses an opportunity to be something special.
A few other items to mull over.  The story is set in a desert, but the heat must not be very intense, and never really seems to bother anyone, from the soldiers in dark uniforms, to the guys with the gigantic headgear who should be ready to faint.  The Earth soldiers initially found the desert people at work, after Jackson was dragged by a desert beast.  He should have been roasted like a hot dog by the hot sand.  And how about those desert people, toiling in the heat, then travelling across the desert, apparently not even carrying any water.  At one point, Jackson eats a candy bar, and later offers one as a gift, but in neither instance has the chocolate melted in the heat.  The small team from Earth apparently brought enough weapons with them to arm the entire planet.  That's good, because the ""primitive"" native kids handle firearms like combat veteran commandos.  And why, like so many other movies, do the interior sets look so sterile and fake.  Thousands of years later, and Ra and his band still dress like ancient Egyptians?  Talk about a time warp.  Who or what is flying the craft that attack the desert people?  Robots, or does Ra do pilot training too?
David Arnold's music does a good job of making some of the mundane scenes seem exciting.  If you don't expect too much, Stargate will suffice as an evening's entertainment.  Something to watch, and then immediately dismiss.  You won't however, be able to watch the regular edition DVD, without at least getting up once to flip the disc over to side B. That's right, the disc needs to be flipped over",1027900800,2,3540,4.869565217391305

HOW did MGM and the new (and better!) writers get from THIS awful piece of science fiction junk to the excellent, award-winning tv series?!?
Well, for a start they got a new leading man in the form of Richard Dean Anderson. Due to his own unique sense of humour, the character of Jack O'Neill was re-written from guilt-ridden, suicidal soldier of the movie to a caring, handsome and funny man whom the audience can actually give a damn about.
Secondly, they re-cast the role of Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and added Captain Sam Carter (Amanda Tapping) and Teal'c (Chris Judge) to make a complete team who actually seem like normal, believable characters and human beings rather than objects.

Jay Davis (The Crying Game) is a really starnge alien leader. I won't give much away but he is like a snake in the grass.
James Spader played a great ""nerdy"" scientist and the most unsuspecting leading ""love"" man. He falls in love with the alien female (played by Alexi Cruz)and ends up saving Earth and her planet too.

Since I first watched it, however, I have become interested in Egypt, taking courses in college, reading books and journals and even learning hieroglyphs.  I must say now that the writers did NOT understand egypt and their mythology AT ALL.  I know this is sci-fi and you wouldn't expect it to be realistic but this is way off.  The gods look all wrong and the ancient iconography and mythology is way off and misinterpreted.  But that shouldn't matter much.  After all, it's just a story and it's a pretty good one and it's got the visual effects to back it up.",1010534400,,953,4.482558139534884

Now then, a comment about the guy who doesn't like Letterboxing.  Umm, dude!  DVDs are made for Widescreen presentations!  The letterboxing MAINTAINS the theatrical presentation.  Unless your local theater has a 4:3 screen then you're missing at least a third of the picture by LOVING Pan'n'Scan.  I hate to see what you're going to do when HDTVs are the norm in their 16:9 format.  If anything I HATE watching movies in Pan'n'Scan because I KNOW that there is more picture there that I'm not seeing.  I've been watching VHS widescreen versions for years now on a 27"" and have no problem ""tuning-out"" the black bars.  I have just bought a DVD player and a 32"" Sony WEGA Trinitron and Widescreen hasn't looked better.  One step down from HD.
But now back to the film itself.  Stargate is about a circular gate that is a portal from one point in space to another through a wormhole.  The portal in this film is one to a planet that apparently has simularities to Earth's Ancient Egypt.  Except the Gods are aliens that have adopted ancient Egyption dieties for appearances.  We have the pharoah-looking Sun God Rah, the jackal-looking Anubis, and the eagle-looking Horus.  They also have cool looking skypods armed with the same energy weapon that the ground troops carry.
The film could have been better had the locale and culture of the people there on the alien planet been a little more dynamic.  But at least it spawned a highly successful TV series where these alien worlds and story lines could be fleshed out more.",1009065600,6,1644,4.71578947368421

James Spader is, as always, poised and controlled. In ""Stargate"" he is a scientist who has controversial views of the origins of the Pyramids in Egypt. He's recruited by the military to crack the code on a stargate to another civilization on the other side of the universe. With Kurt Russell, (who was not at his best in this movie) and a bunch of other military personnel they find themselves sucked into another world, one ruled by the evil Ra.  Here the story begins to unfold of the ""true"" origins of all those gods, temples, pyramids and beliefs of the ancient Egyptians.  The storyline moves nicely and the movie itself reminded me, in some ways, of Lawrence of Arabia, the Indiana Jones adventures, and ""The Fifth Element"". The visual affects are minimal, but they do get the point across. The set work is finely structured and elegant.

I also liked the concepts it presented; especially the thought of a mortal God, and the theory that religion is just another attempt of man to feel fulfillment for all his hard work. The end wasn't all that surprising, but it was a give-away to the series.
As for all the claims that the only good quality of the film is the SFX [special effects]...people are entitled to their opinion, but it takes someone quite dense not to see the timeless theme of it.

654797,3,6303398480,"with a creative science fiction story behind it, Stargate is definitely worth a viewing.  Emmerich couples outstanding visual effects with tremendous audio and some interesting special features on the DVD.
In the cast, both Spader and Jaye Davidson contribute strong performances.  Spader is the everyman who is a specialist in some sort of obscure intelligentsia who gets confronted with action and involved with people when his science comes alive.  He makes the right choices and has both the audience and the rest of the cast rooting for him as he stumbles into his eventual success.  An interesting actor who can play a naive hero or a driven villain, Spader leads the way in this film.  Jaye Davidson is chilling as the villain.  Without words, his presence on screen can make you feel his lack of remorse and his willingness to do away with everything that comes between him and his final destiny.
Soldiers in the cast include the oft-cast Russell as the commander of the mission, in, what is typical for him, a ""strong jaw"" role.
Critics have challenged this movie as absurd and cliche, but after all, what is science fiction trying to accomplish?  Stargate had success at the box office and on video precisely because of its entertainment value and the visual excitement generated by combining technology with a society that rivals the ancient Egyptians.  Although you may rent instead of buy, you will enjoy this entertaining film, and may return to it again and again because it draws you in and keeps you entertained until the very last (and yes, it is a heart-warming finale!)

So is the general plot of Stargate, and it makes for a very enjoyable movie. James Spader plays Daniel Jackson, a language expert who deciphers the Stargate's code, and Kurt Russell plays the leader of the military expedition who goes through with Jackson on reconnisence to find out what is on the other side. They find a civilization of humans, kept by the ""god"" Ra as slaves, and everything goes from there.  Stargate delivers a fairly intriguing story with good action scenes, made all the better by excellent speacil effects, including an insanely cool ""pulse rifle"" weapon. The acting is fine; you can't help but laugh at Spader's nerdiness, and even Russell does well as a hardened military man trying to get over the death of his son. One of the best points about the plot is that while Russell at first appears to be the standard military hardnose, he eventually ends up working along with Spader and the rest, avoiding the cliche of him fighting/betraying his comrades in the name of the mission. The final action scene is a great intermix between three seperate events, which keeps the pace up beautifully. The story is also interesting to follow, from Spader's working out the Stargate symbols to his discovery of the people history.  There are a few holes in the plot. The relationship between the two Stargates is never really explained; its hard to tell whether they work together, or both of them just send you to one point, regardless of where the other is. Near the end of the movie, the power of a particular bomb is fairly overated.  However, minor flaws aside, Stargate is definitely worth purchasing, combining good action and intersting science fiction.

Also, after several viewings (and after ""3rd Rock From the Sun"" became a hit) I realized French Stewart is in this movie, and he's actually got his eyes open! All right, maybe that isn't enough for you-what is perhaps the movie's best selling point is the idea that the Egyptian pyramids are actually alien landing pads, and there's a ""lost"" tribe of Egyptians on another planet that is reached, how else, through the Stargate. Kurt Russell as the hardened Col. Jack O'Neill, is a bit emotionally staid throughout the film, but Spader makes up for that in spades with an energetic performance, particularly when he is thrown into a ritual in which he is supposed to ""perform"" a certain rite with his romatic interest Sha-uri (Mili Avital.)  Jaye Davidson (""The Crying Game) gives a striking portrayal of the beautiful, almighty alien calling himself Ra. Part action/adventure, part sci-fi, this movie has many great facets.

Good production from the same guy who did ""Independence  Day"" and, more recently, ""Patriot,"" but much of it is hard  to believe.  A primitive people become very comfortable with advanced  automatic rifles, for instance, despite having initially been horrified by  a Zippo.  Spader is able to understand their language once he ""gets  the vowels down,"" which he does very quickly.  (This is an ancient  Egyptian dialect--remember, these people were the ancient colonists--which  over thousands of years has not changed! Absurd!)  Jay Davidson, looking as  lithely feminine as ever, plays ""Ra,"" god to both the ancient  Egyptians, and the primitives in this other universe.  He is cagey enough  to survive for thousands of years, but so inept that he gives a weapon to  Spader, expecting him to kill his comrades...Duh, Ra!  How could you be so  stupid?
Small details like this can spoil a movie for me because they are  so easily fixed...but aren't, apparently, out of sheer laziness.  This is a  B-movie in fancy clothes, but enjoyable enough, and worth a look if there's  nothing better available.

654885,1,6303398480,"You would think this hunk of barn yard droppings would have been enough to have had Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich chased out of Hollywood by quality directors and producers. But then, I just said the magic word, `Hollywood',  which means so long as the film's plot can be understood by studio  executives it is therefore suitable for consumption by the flat-line  encephalograph movie-going public. The fact that movies like Stargate get  made is proof positive that people really will watch anything. These are  also the same people who like to call movies like this `intelligent science  fiction'. Let me explain things to you: There hasn't been an intelligent  science fiction movie made since `RoboCop'.
 Stargate deals with the  unearthing of an large stone circle in Egypt during the 1930s, and it's  immediately shipped back the States where, after almost seventy years of  examination, the brain trust assembled to study can't tell us anything more  than it's a big stone ring. Along comes James Spader and his big brain and  figures it out in, like, five minutes. That is except for the last symbol,  which he finds on the back of a news paper that he snatches out of the hand  of a confused guard. The symbols correspond to stars, hence the first part  of the title. They quickly figure out how to open the Stargate and send a  military mission led by Kurt Russel.
 Okay, I worship Kurt Russel.  Sure he's short, but he's also been Snake Plisken and Jack Burton! Here he  plays his future roll from Soldier, only with more dialogue. I swear, give  Russel another six inches in height and he'd be a shoe in for Nick Fury.
  Spader, Russel, and his nuke-equipped, tough-as-nails, dumb-as-fence-post  soldiers step out into, well, Egypt. Well, another planet that looks  exactly like Egypt, there's even pyramids. Only they find they are now  trapped because Spader can't figure out how to reopen the gate on this end.  I also want to know when writers will come to understand a simple fact (are  you paying attention Mr. Lucas?): large deserts preclude the existence of  large desert dwelling creatures. Large creatures need gallons of water and  tons of food each day to sustain themselves, and do not run wild where the  only thing to eat for miles is sand. Aside from large sand dwelling  creatures, we also find out that all those nuts who preach pyramid power  and ancient astronauts were right! The pyramids of Egypt were built by  aliens. Really DUMB aliens, but aliens nonetheless.
 Why would a  culture so technologically advanced that they can build galaxy-spanning  devices like Stargates, pyramid sized space craft, energy weapons and cool  morphing armor, why would such a culture keep slaves? Societies that can do  all that usually have funky equipment to build all of their things, but I  guess monuments mean more when 20,000 sweating slaves lug thousands of tons  of stone to build your pyramid. I guess Devlin and Emmerich would assume  that the audience wouldn't pay attention to things like that, or how 20 US  Marines can be killed by two Chip n' Dale dancers in Horus head gear.
  Suffice it to say this movie stinks worse than a Celine Dion cover version  of Led Zepplin's `Whole Lot of Love'. It presents the characters with  unsolvable plot twists, only to have them resolved by unconvincing means  such as newspapers and graffiti on pyramid walls. The really weird part is,  the movie is now a TV show: Stargate SG-1, starring Richard Dean Anderson,  and it takes the basic premise then throws out everything else, improving  it immensely.

The inhabitants  on the other side of the portal were hard to accommodate mentally also. The  enslaving villains made for some fearsome moments with their gadgety armour  but eveybody looks too good. I could hear echoes of 'Mad Max Beyond  Thunderdome' when I watched the middle part of this film: too much put into  empowering downtrodden feral adolescents. From here on, the movie drags  excruciatingly. While realistic and well intended, 'Stargate' just seems to  fall far short of another film based upon a similar premise, 'Contact', but  it's worth watching once and perhaps (just to scrape the insides of the jar  for anything you'd missed on the first go) twice.

I find this film to  be highly enjoyable. Its not too taxing but it has a sense of adventure  lacking in other films. There is a sense of wonder about this film that  makes it watchable (sadly the TV series lacks the film's charm, pace and  sense of wonder and imagination).
The only negative point regarding the  DVD is the picture quality. The film is okay until the scene when Ra's ship  first lands. As the dust swirls the picture quality noticeably drops -  evidently there were problems trying to compress this image and in order to  avoid artefacting something had to give. In spite of this the film is  watchable, the overall picture quality varies from 10/10 to 7/10. I doubt  that this will spoil anyone else's enjoyment. For those who prefer 200%  technical perfction from any film I doubt that there is any DVD, video  cassette in existence that can satisfy them.",944956800,15,1156,4.5
655063,4,6303398480,"Like the Star Trek franchise of movies, STARGATE is actually a sci-fi film with an even mixture of intelligence and blazing action.  The intertwining of an alien being the explanation for Egyptian history and mythology is not  new, but is handled in a clever and exciting way.  The effects are  excellent as is the production design.  My favorite being the rings that  shoot down to transport people along with the excellent sound effect that  accompanies them.  The Stargate itself is also a design masterpiece; and  the geometric concept behind a Stargate and the point of origin; and the  idea of encoding the chevrons to get to another planet in any part of the  universe....
The viewer will see how the alien influences Egyptian  historical culture, (or how Egyptian historical culture influences  Hollywood aliens!).
As usual, James Spader does a fine job.  His  scatter-brained, yet highly intelligent, Daniel Jackson is charming with  just enough nerishness to pepper his character.  Kurt Russel does well as  the taciturn Col. O'Neil, still mourning the death of his son.
The only  disappointment is the last twenty-or-so minutes where the action is  definitely progressing at a breakneck speed, but in all honesty, we never  do care about the otherworldly extras enough to get lost in the suspense of  saving their planet.  However, this is definitely one of my all time  sci-fi/action favorites.",943660800,11,1406,5.119469026548672
655064,5,6303398480,"This movie is an excellent transfer of the original. The picture and sound quality was great, and the extra footage was very interesting. I especially liked the special DVD feature of being able to play the special edition  with the extra footage, or the theatrical version without the extra  footage. I would recommend this version to anyone who liked the original.",943401600,3,366,4.983606557377049
655065,5,6303398480,"Yes, I like the cast of the series better, but THE MOVIE CAME OUT FIRST!  Don't review it based on the cast of the series, as this was the basis for that series! The movie was great, good suprise hit..had all the elements of  a great action flick.",943401600,,247,4.125
655066,2,6303398480,I purchase the DVD release before the special edition and was really unhappy to find that half way through the movie i had to turn over the god damn disk. I was looking forward to watching stargate on DVD but this just  ruined it for me. I am now stuck with a movie i enjoy split on two sides of  a disk that can easily fit the movie on one side. I would avoid purchasing  this edition as i gather that nothing has changed to most likely still have  to flip the disk.,943056000,2,467,3.989247311827957
655067,4,6303398480,"This movie is by far one of my favorites.  However, Kurt Russel was a horrible Colonel O'Neil.  Richard Dean Anderson, by far and wide, brought more to the character in SG1 than Russel could possibly have. If this movie  would have had the cast the SG-1 series has, it would have been much  better. Regarding the DVD, it's limited in it's extras, I was really hoping  for some deleted scenes or makings of's.  It's the earlier release, so I  guess that's their excuse.  Get the Special Edition for a few bucks more,  it has some extra stuff that this one doesn't.",942537600,,563,4.4950495049504955

655120,5,6303398480,"This movie is one of the best Sci Fi movies around. It is original and unique. The movie has never received its do recognition and should be named as one of the top ten Sci Fi movies of all time in my opinion. Also, the  soundtrack is great and the special effects are very good. This film will  always rank up with my other Sci Fi favorites such as Blade Runner and Star  Wars",940809600,2,377,4.0675675675675675

655123,5,6303398480,"I just went out and bought an NTSC video so I could watch the special edition.
First, I love the way they blend Ancient Egyptian beliefs and legends into the storyline - the Egyptian Gods are actually Ra's henchmen  in their battle helmets, The Pharoh's sarchophogi were based on Ra's bed  and so on.  They did a wonderful job in blending these little hints in -  never saying it overtly, just letting you pick it up if you saw it.
The  characters are fun...the two hero's approaching nominal normality from  opposite ends of the spectrum.  The action scenes are also good fun, as is  just about everything else.  There are a couple of niggling little  problems, but frankly they're too petty to mention.  One of my all time  favourite films.",933206400,,742,4.623076923076923
655124,4,6303398480,"First off, I love this movie.  But I do hate the way this Disc is formatted.  Two sided!?!?!?  Every other DVD I have is Single sided (some Dual Layered) why couldn't they do a single sided disc with this movie too?  But that's not all!  There is one scene that is TOTALLY DIFFERENT than in  the LaserDisc version and from what I remember in the Movie Theater.  It's  the scene where Jackson and the other head honchos are looking at the video  from the malp probe, and Jackson says he can decipher the markings on the  other gate.  O'Neil's line is totally different!  Instead of saying  ""Your Call"" and walking away like he does on the LaserDisc and  Theatrical relase (which makes a lot more sense), he says ""He's full  of sh*t."" and walks away!  Which makes no sense at all!  Especially if  West ingores that remark and tells Jackson ""You're on the team.""  I've checked both discs, DVD and LD, totally different lines.  Now which  one was it supposed to be?  I'd really like to know...  But I'll keep my  DVD and LD versions until a NEW and IMPROVED Stargate DVD comes out,  hopfully addressing these issues.",932083200,2,1112,4.494949494949495
655125,4,6303398480,"I found this to be a rare experience where you wish the editing team had left it a bit longer and you got to see some of the footage that was clipped.  While Russell's performance may be a bit one-dimensional, but  then the character he plays is just that -- someone transforming BACK from  the 'dark' to a, pardon the cliche, well rounded person.  Spader on the  otherhand comes off better than 'well' from the start as the geek  archiologist -- looking a bit like Bill Gates at that, whose more human  side likewise transforms.  The good special effects augment a strong story  rather than being the centerpeice itself.  Veteran actress Vivica Linfors  is perfect as the kindly if somewhat matriachical civilian project leader  whose domain is overtaken by the military.  Overall it is an evenly  enjoyable experience with good production values that draws in the audiance  and holds them all the way through; certainly a credit to good direction  but equally so to a fine script.",929232000,,982,4.790419161676646
