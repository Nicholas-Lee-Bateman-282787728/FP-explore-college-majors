7122997,2,B00W64YQC6,This movie is far from a horror movie and the acting is horrible. I wouldn't even recommend this as a rental!!!,1437523200,,111,4.333333333333333
7122998,3,B00W64YQC6,Stars for Kierney Nelson and the guy playing Willy the kidnapping ice cream truck driver.  So-so story and a failed romance discussion that takes up way too much time.,1437177600,,167,4.758620689655173
7122999,5,B00W64YQC6,"Loved this movie!! Well acted, great directing, and a great thrill ride start to finish!! I'm so excited to add this movie to my collection!",1437177600,,140,4.64
7123000,4,B00W64YQC6,I agree that it's not a true horror movie but I really liked this film. The story was good and it kept my interest.,1436832000,2,115,3.8333333333333335
7123001,5,B00W64YQC6,"I LOVED this movie!  I personally abhor the blood and gore horror movies that have edged out the ""Rosemary's Baby"" type flicks of my youth.  Kruel took a great step back to the psychological torment we all loved so much in movies like ""Psycho"" and ""Cujo""!  For the first time in a long time I caught myself holding my breath and at one point I actually had my knees pulled up to my chest (quite a feat for a 65 year old) in an effort to comfort myself against the building tension!

The girl that played 'Jo' did an amazing job for the entire movie; I felt like I were in her shoes, completely invested in her dilemma!  I cannot wait to see her again!  The ice cream man was CREEEEPY!  And not in a fake, hollyweird sort of way.  You KNOW people like this guy-- and trust me-- you will look at them with more suspicion after this flick!  The other stand-out in this movie is the mother of the missing boy.  She fully captured what someone goes through after losing a child.  When she cried, I cried!  The supporting cast was amazing!  From the doting father, to the scuzzy but somehow still lovable boyfriend, to the caring, small-town cops, to the not-quite-right motel clerk; they all kept me in the story!

In all, Kruel is worth a look.  If you like a good old fashion 'scary because it could happen' flick, you can't miss it!",1435449600,5,1330,4.327935222672065
7123002,3,B00W64YQC6,"Robert Henderson's ""Kruel"" is a psychological thriller with hints of horror in one intensely drawn nightmare. Unfortunately though, it is a horror film without any horror. Yeah I know that that statement is argumentative considering the subject matter, but I didn't feel that ""Kruel"" had enough horror genre elements to be classified as a real horror movie.

Now the story that Henderson has devised is captivating and deals with some very horrific realities of society. There is an antagonist that is creepy and nightmarish as all get out. The acting and direction that Robert Henderson takes with this film is stellar on almost all levels of story telling. It is dark, emotional, and often insanely intense. However the story stays in very dramatic, suspense thriller areas where character development and scene building reach a fevered pitch but never deliver any real heat.

The special effects aren't really present in this ""horror"" film through 98% of the movie. It is all melodrama, high emotion dialog, and really cool scene transitions that combine with some very retro horror designed sounds. Only there is no real horror present. Everything stays suggestive or just not approached. Which sucks because had Henderson thrown in some noticeable giallo styled gore or graphic violence, then ""Kruel"" could have been a breakaway hit. Unfortunately everything stays pretty PG-13. There is one single boob shot and one moment of gushing blood, but that comes ""too little too late"" for me personally.

Overall I have to say that ""Kruel"" is going to disappoint almost all horror fans going into this film expecting anything other than a really emotional, dramatic story. As I have said-there is no real horror here. The subject matter is horrific, the drama is intense and the story is well written. It is all just a bit ""Lifetime Movie Network Adjacent"". I got the same experience while watching this film that I have gotten mistakenly watching a few of the church produced ""horror films"". Still the acting and story are pretty nice. Just wish that the film was marketed as psychological thriller or dramatic thriller, instead of Horror thriller.",1435104000,3,2148,5.096590909090909

7123031,1,B00W64YQC6,I'll admit that I didn't watch this whole movie. Honestly I could only watch the first like ten minutes. I couldn't stand watching anymore. It was a very cliche teen/college drama with a killer in it obviously. The acting was horrible as well. So I gave up on it. I would defiantly recommend skipping this movie.

7123035,2,B00W64YQC6,"Clown horror movies are all the rage, but this one tries to be different because the clown angle is but a small part of the whole story and it's not really a horror film. Different doesn't always translate as being good, though. Ben Hood (Dakota Morrissiey) and Jo O'Hare (Kierney Nelson) are kissing in a car when Jo notices something is wrong with Ben. Ben fesses-up and tells Jo that he cheated on her when she was in college, so Jo breaks up immediately with him and won't answer his many phone calls or answer his text messages. Jo's mother Jill (Elizabeth Brewster) and father Dan (Adam Vernier) are more upset with her for coming home at 3:00AM then having her heart broken, but Daddy is a tad more understanding. Jo has been having a really hard time in her life lately: She blew out a knee and lost her track scholarship to college and has to pay to go back on her own (if she wants to go back). Now Mom has forbade her from leaving the house (A grown woman grounded to the house? Hey, Mom: Up yours! I'm an adult.); she is only allowed to leave when she babysits for young boys Brandon (Cooper Henderson) and Elliott Walters (Matthew Weidle) to make enough money to (maybe) go back to college. While she is babysitting (apparently they like to be called ""nannies"" now) and on the phone talking to a girlfriend, the ice cream truck comes up the street and she gives the kids money to go get their favorite ice cream. Elliott comes running back all ashen-faced with the money still in his hand, but he refuses to talk about what happened. Matthew has no idea, so Jo goes outside to talk to the ice cream man. She is in for quite the surprise when she sees Willie (J.T. Chinn) is a freakish-looking clown (he has ice cream cones painted over his eye areas). He also won't talk about what happened, but instead puts on a puppet show (!) saying how cute Jo is, which freaks her out. The following day, Ben shows up in the Walters' front yard while Jo is playing with the kids and apologizes once again for cheating on her. This is his only way to talk to her since she won't talk to him on the phone or answer his text messages (Kid today and their text messaging!). While they are arguing, Elliott ends up missing, which results in a massive police search complete with helicopters. When the police come up empty-handed, detectives interrogate Jo and infer that she may be involved in the kidnapping. Yes, Jo is having a very bad time in her life right now (To add insult to injury, Elliott's mother [Colleen Yorke] slaps her in the face). Ben feels partly responsible because he was keeping Jo too busy to keep proper eyes on the children (he is). When Ben tells Jo about a crazy man he saw fishing without a worm or even a hook, she thinks back to Elliott and the thing that happened between him and Willie and becomes convinced that the clown pervert is responsible. Ben calls Jo and says he found the ice cream man, so she jumps into Ben's Jeep and they follow him, but Ben is a prick and drives right next to the ice cream truck (even though Jo begs him not to) and Willie sticks his tongue out at them. Jo tells her story to the police, but they believe Elliott is dead from drowning in an unfortunate accident (a pile of the clothes he was wearing were next to the local lake) and discard Jo's accusations. Ben has discovered where Willie lives and plans on breaking into his house that night (Willie is a security guard at night) to find evidence that Willie is a pedophile. Ben and Jo go inside his house (his front door isn't even locked, which threw up a red flag to me) and find walls full of freaky photos (believe me, they are weird!) and lots of toys from the 1940's & 1950's sitting on shelves. They start turning on by themselves (like some burglar alarm, but much creepier), forcing Ben and Jo to leave the house. As they are leaving, a figure approaches Ben's car and breaks his driver side window. The next morning, Jo goes jogging (What happened to Mom grounding her?) and Willie unsuccessfully tries to kill her with a knife. Jo goes to the police, who say that Willie has disappeared and Ben is now packing heat. Jo and Ben are now a couple again and Willie breaks into her house, but it all turns out to be a nightmare by Jo (the image of Jo and Willie on opposite sides of a door in the ad materials is taken from that nightmare sequence). Jo takes a shower (she has nice perky breasts; wait I can do a puppet show explaining it!) and then cries about how her life turned out, but Daddy makes her feel better about herself. She jumps into Ben's distinctive yellow Jeep to find him dead and Willie appears behind her and chloroforms her until she in knocked-out. She wakes up and finds herself tied to some bathroom in a seasonal motel in the woods (and this is out-of-season). A still-alive Elliott is there, too, in another room. They are in the middle of the Okefenokee Swamp (filmed in Jacksonville, Florida). Jo breaks free and hides in the swamp (She text messages Daddy, but the cell phone goes dead), but a bullhorn-talking, ATV-riding Willie makes her give herself up when he says he will kill Elliott. He shoots Jo with a tranquilizer dart and when she wakes up, Jo is tied to the floor where many lit candles surround her and has had most of her body painted. Willie wants him, Jo and Elliott to be a family. Dad has the Sheriff (Tom Riska) call the telephone company and triangulate the last message Jo sent to him before her phone died (She only has one of those phones that sends text messages, but doesn't make phone calls and Dad was about to give her a real cell phone today [Never heard of such a thing. How can it be a phone and not make phone calls?]). Dad gets the information and drives out to the area, where he knocks on Willie's door and he answers (no one knows what Willie looks like without his clown makeup). Willie tells Dad that he hasn't seen his daughter, even though she is behind the door with a knife to her throat. When Dad notices Ben's yellow Jeep behind the motel, he calls the Sheriff and breaks down the front door of Willie's room with an axe, but Willie makes him drop it when he has a butcher knife to Jo's throat. He slices Jo's throat anyway (Clowns are funny that way) and we see Dad and Willie fight as shadows on the wall (the only real creativity in the film), so we are not sure who has won the fight. Turns out that Dad was the winner and he tries to stem the bleeding from Jo's throat. Jo wakes up in the hospital and can't talk, so she writes down how her father and Elliott are. Her mother says they are fine. Jo then writes, ""Willie?"" and Mom tells her not to worry about it. His body was never found, so Jo and her family move to a different State. Jo then does a final voice-over as a dedication to the dead Ben, which would give diabetes to a thin man who has eaten properly all his life.  This is the freshman effort by director/screenwriter/co-producer Robert Henderson (it seems a lot of Henderson family members worked both in front and behind the cameras) and this film's really major distraction is the simply awful acting ability of Dakota Morrissiey as Ben. He shows about as much emotion as a rock (I think quartz has him beat) and talks in annoying monotone, even when he is in danger. The film suffers greatly every time he is on screen, so it was actually a relief when Jo found him dead. Too bad it comes during the film's final 20 minutes. Most of the other actors are below average, but when compared to Morrissiey's acting, they all look like Laurence Olivier. Since this is a psychological thriller and not a horror film, there's not much blood until the final third and Kierney Nelson has a nice rack, but her nude scene is much too quick. The only real plus in this film is J.T. Chinn as Willie Kool (yes, that is the last name they gave him according to the final credits). He brings the right amount of menace and creepiness to his role, although the clown angle takes up precious little time. If all the actors were this good, I would recommend this film, but this is a really long 104 minutes due to the bad and over-acting. This film tries to show us what it takes to be a family, warts and all but, unfortunately, the cast of unknown actors are not up to the task and makes Jo's family unit seem shrill and unrealistic (What mother grounds her college daughter?). Since this is Robert Henderson's first film, I'm willing to cut him some slack (all the technical aspects are fine) and if he had a cast of talented character actors, the film would have been much, much better. I'll give Henderson a pass this time, but his second film better wow me.

It is one of the movies that you can watch again and catch a lot of other little clues that are all through out the movie.  The whole movie from beginning to end was fairly fast paced in a way that there is always something going on or to look out for.

I liked this element of the film with the tables being turned...that and the gratuitous shower scene.

Other than that, the film lacks. The characters were flat. The cops were unconvincing. Dakota Morrissiey  was pathetic by design. Our bad guy was a partial mystery, although there weren't any other suspects. He really didn't have much character. It looks like they spent their budget on toy monkeys with cymbals. Not as good as that other ice cream truck killer film series.

7123105,2,B00W64YQC6,"The movie feels like a short that was pointlessly extended into a feature.

From the get-go, the movie's villain is immediately addressed and the writer/director didn't even try to dissuade viewers whatsoever. Even the ""Beware of those you trust"" has practically no validity herein. Beyond her boyfriend conceding to having cheated on her after the intro credits, there's nothing that happens wherein our heroine ""trusts"" the wrong person/people. Again, had the director played with the idea of villainy (the boyfriend is really suspicious but isn't actually sinister--just poorly acted) and how it can be anyone, such a tag might've had relevance. As it stands, no, it doesn't.

So yeah, from the first 10 minutes, the movie addresses who the villain is and then takes all nearly the entire run time to get to the ""action""/""horror"". Before that, its a ton of filler content of nothing really happening and an obsessive boyfriend (that looks and acts like he's related to Ross from Friends) constantly and obnoxiously bugging the protagonist to take him back. Seriously, the guy's actions are outright harassment--even the lame villain on the cover knows that and isn't as annoying. That, and I've never known a girl's father and mother who are totally chill with a guy cheating on their daughter, and worse, make out the daughter like she's the one at fault and is the one that needs to go back to him and work it out. Total. Parent. Fail.

During the final ten minutes, there's finally some stuff going on (mainly a single off-camera kill), but it's directed in so boring a way that it's just forgettable. It all feels like a Lifetime relationship drama that needed some attention, so they through in a horror-esque subplot involving a kinda-loony ice-cream man.

For what it's worth, the lead actress did give it her all.",1445212800,4,1824,4.950980392156863

This movie was great,, kept me interested and scared me a couple of times.. I like that it's not based on a fiction character
 these kind of people do exist and I really enjoyed watching this movie I will now take more precaution when being around strangers especially if they act weird I give it two thumbs up.. One thing I would recommend is to watch it at night.. And be aware that the cops in this film will leave you disappointed...",1444953600,,476,4.409090909090909

7123127,5,B00W64YQC6,"Really enjoyed this movie. Yea it's a bit on the low buget side, but its not anywhere near some movies i rent that look like they were made with a cell phone camera!  This is the perfect movie to lay down, relax in the dark after a long weeks work, grab some popcorn and enjoy! Many intense moments and enough suspense to keep me not only interested but on the edge of my seat at times! :) No it's not really horror, more on the side of suspense/thriller. The main girls acting was GREAT, i'm surprized i have not seen her in many other movies?!!! Im sure we all will be soon after her performance in this one. :)

Hope this helped

Jo and Ben are 2 teenagers having a hard breakup, In the midst of all this, The child that jo is taking care of has gone missing, Jo discovers the local ice-cream man is a nut job and is determined to find the childs kidnapper.

7123130,3,B00W64YQC6,"Not a great movie but also not bad either. Clearly a lower budget film that should be considered more of a suspense/drama. Some of the acting was good, some not so good, but overall not a waste of time. Read the "" A Southern Horror Fan"" for the most accurate review.",1438128000,,266,4.235294117647059
7123131,1,B00W64YQC6,"If you get by the fake ""positive reviews"" put up by film crew, then take this as nothing but a horrible, horrible video.  It is billed as ""horror"" but they spend 1 hour talking about a bad relationship.  Some nut, played by the worst acting guy around, attempts to scare us with his idiotic speeches.  He's a ""psychotic killer"".  This makes no sense at all, and it is long, at 96 min runtime.",1438041600,,392,4.328767123287672

8712259,4,B00W64YQC6,"*There is nothing more terrifying than creepy clowns (especially to those of us who are coulrophobic anyway). The movie Kruel features just such an entity, and it was truly disturbing! Its about a psychotic killer who poses as an ice cream man in order to get closer to his victims.

Teenage Jo (Kierney Nelson) breaks up with Ben (Dakota Morrissiey) because he cheated on her with a friend of hers. Shes babysitting two young boys, Brandon (Cooper Henderson) and Elliott (Matthew Weidle). The boys ask for ice cream from a truck outside, so Jo gives them money and watches from the window. Elliott runs back inside in terror, so Jo goes out to investigate. The child was frightened by the evil clown mask the ice cream man was wearing, as well as his creepy hand puppets.

Elliott is so scared, he refuses to get ice cream from that truck at all. Shortly thereafter, the ice cream man, Willie (J.T. Chinn) starts with almost stalking behaviors.

Jos friend Jessica (Ansley Gordon) thinks Jo is blowing Willies creepiness out of proportion, so she goes up to the ice cream truck and points out where Jo lives. Elliott goes missing shortly thereafter.

Ben, whos trying to get back with Jo, goes to take a look at this ice cream man, and identifies him as the same guy who was pretending to fish (without bait on his line) near the river the same day and place that Elliott went missing. Jo goes to the sheriff, who refuses to investigate further without more proof of the allegations.

After that, people are turning up murdered and Jo herself is kidnapped by Willie. She is now in the fight for not only her life, but Elliotts as well.

Youll never look at an ice cream truck the same way after this demented tale of terror!",1468540800,,1725,4.584415584415584
8712260,3,B00W64YQC6,Enjoyed this movie. It was just scary enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Had a bit of a twist near the end and that was something I did not see coming. Fun to watch late at night..,1465257600,,190,3.658536585365854
