3090736,5,B0012K53SG,I bought these for my daughters 2nd grade class teacher for her end of year party. I thought each disc was an episode. But each disc had 7 episodes a piece. The teacher and the kids loved them. keep them entertained for the whole week,1374710400,,234,4.222222222222222

I truly wish there were good programs on TV today, thanks goodness for DVDs like these that have a great storyline, where people fought for justice and the bad guys always paid their dues!
We have watched all 6 Volumes and plan to order the remaining ones.",1362528000,2,422,4.794520547945205
3090738,5,B0012K53SG,This set was very good. The picture quality of the black & white was very good.  In fact I liked thse so well I ordered all the volumes they had. I love old westerns and these was some you can't beat. They were great.,1362441600,7,217,3.9318181818181817
3090739,1,B0012K53SG,"Total agreement w/ last reviewer.
Vol 1 (not labeled as one) has at least two shows that are on other discs in this series.  No attempt to properly sequence in order of showing.  Expected less than perfect quality due to age of shows, but quality much poorer than restored discs of this same vintage.  Also most disappointing that the end credits were often copies of end credits from another show.  One of the good things about watching vintage shows/films is discovering people who were bit actors then who later become stars.

Super Roy Rogers fans, be prepared for a major disappointment.",1355529600,7,592,4.821782178217822
3090740,1,B0012K53SG,"As verified by someone else's review, the picture quality jumps around from ""decent"" to ""poor."" A couple episodes are so difficult to watch you'll be forced to skip to the next episode. A few of them have been edited and the closing credits don't match with the episode (apparently very poor editing, why would you want to see who is in the cast you just watched when the closing credits belong to a different episode?). Worse, the company superimposed their company logo on the corner of the screen. Very annoying. The packaging is very attractive, I'll give them that. But it's the only thing attractive and good about these DVDs. If you want superb quality, I recommend you get the 25-disc box set from CoverOut dot com because their product is much, much better. I bought a set last month and have been pleased all the way.",1326672000,25,827,4.63265306122449
3090741,1,B0012K53SG,"I was really looking forward to this set. As of this writing I have not reviewed or watched volumes 7 through 16 but if they are like this one, I will definitely have issues. The quality of the shows is all over the board, from scratchy 16mm prints to fairly good quality. The shows are not in chronological order of date produced and aired, which brings up another interesting thing about these DVDs. Some episodes have the credits from shows done in 1952, when it is clearly evident that these were later episodes in the series. Proof of that is the same credits on three of 4 shows on 1 DVD, featuring the wrong actors in the episode, and the same 1952 copyright date.

I have watched 5 of the 6 DVDs in this package and each DVD has 4 episodes. Unfortunately, I have twice already experienced the same episode on 2 different DVDs. So far, out of the 20 episodes I have watched, only 18 are different, and at least 3 have the wrong credits.

Very disappointed and I would like an explanation. While I am enjoying the shows, I expect better quality from an Amazon vendor.",1323993600,43,1073,4.414141414141414

8246301,1,B0012K53SG,The six volume by Oldies.com was received as a gift. The first DVD would not play all episodes. It locked up on 4 player devices. We tried the second volume and it too could only play one of the 4 episodes. The third volume also failed. When contacted Oldies.com they said they could not replace it because it was a gift and they have no record of it. My daughter would be terribly upset to know of the problem as it was a gift for Mother's Day and she would feel she failed. Oldies.com says they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee. When called they said they could do nothing since it was purchased through Amazon. We have three volume unopened and they still would not allow a return. Sad customer service.,1526860800,,708,4.412213740458015

8246303,5,B0012K53SG,"Alpha Video, oldies.com, deserves a BIG hand of applause.
They restored this impossible-to-find (despite being public domain) film prints and film elements to the very best.
These dvd movies have a VERY good picture, as only 16mm TV positive film prints exist you see. These original film prints are necessary to transfer a quality image, despite being older and used by TV stations.
Knowing this, Alpha did a fantastic job transferring this rare and popular series onto digital DVDs.
Many of these are old positive prints (not 16mm dupes or tape) that'll have some lines, dirt, some splices.
But what you get is the only existing good images of this classic show that dominated 1950s TV.
If you are looking for The Roy Rodgers Show, this set is very highly recommended! A+++++",1498348800,4,777,4.893939393939394

8246306,5,B0012K53SG,"Roy Rogers was the best, by far, cowboy in the saddle.  His athletic capabilities on Trigger, and the smoothness of his seat in the saddle, even at a full gallop, is really pretty to behold.  Also, he had a much better signing voice than Gene Autry.  This series is fun to watch and really takes me back to my childhood.",1430092800,5,320,4.3

8246308,5,B0012K53SG,"Super series.  I have volumes 1-16 and plan on getting the rest.  These movies of Roy and Dale bring back memories of my childhood when I used to play Roy, and my cousin played Dale.  We both had horses, and Roy Rogers' gun sets.  Those were the days when Heroes were actually heroes and willingly served as positive role models.  When I have grandchildren, I look forward to setting down on Saturdays and watch these movies with them.",1416096000,5,435,4.5256410256410255

8246310,4,B0012K53SG,I have to say I LOVE THIS COLLECTION!  The first CD had come loose in the original packaging and has some scratches but it plays okay.  Only a few places you notice it in two of the episodes.  But as a collection it is wonderful.  All other packages and DVD's are fine.  This is a must for any Roy and Dale fan.  Can't get enough.,1380931200,8,330,4.0
