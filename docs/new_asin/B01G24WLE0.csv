7753503,5,B01G24WLE0,Another impossible monster movie with a fabulous made for TV dinosaur in it! What's not to love?,1497484800,,96,4.705882352941177
7753504,5,B01G24WLE0,very good movie.,1484784000,,16,4.666666666666667
7753505,3,B01G24WLE0,Never quite fulfills its promise,1480809600,2,32,5.6
7753506,1,B01G24WLE0,"I have never written a review for a dvd movie before, but I felt I had to say something about this piece of crap. If you have the money to pay for this dvd, then flush it down the toilet. It will be put to better use. Ninety-seven per cent of this movie is people talking. The dinosaur is seen only with a head shot in a storage shed with weird red misty lighting. The head is cheaply constructed and poorly shaped. To show what a non budget picture this is there are only six actors in it. And to top that the leading actress has a face with no facial features and a need for dental work with a bad tooth. I thought I had seen the worst movie with Creature, but this is even worse. H.R.",1480550400,6,687,3.9855072463768115
7753507,1,B01G24WLE0,A little boring,1478304000,2,15,4.333333333333333
7753508,1,B01G24WLE0,Well what can I say. If this movie was free you would have to pay me to own it. Bad casting bad plot . Couldn't even make to Syfy channel due how horrible it was. On the positive note my father slept through the movie and he enjoyed it very much.,1475971200,2,246,3.843137254901961
7753509,1,B01G24WLE0,i cannot believe i actually sat thru this entire movie! kept waiting for it to escape and actually do some damage.would never recommend this for anybody to watch. this must have been a very low budget movie.,1475712000,5,207,4.621621621621622
7753510,2,B01G24WLE0,It wasn't what expected and it kind of sucked no offense,1475280000,2,56,4.181818181818182
7753511,1,B01G24WLE0,"A top secret government funded bio-printer can't make any money producing human body parts so the opt to make a T-Rex...at least it's rubber head. Things go bad, people die in what is mostly three terrible actors on screen. The end credits (Congrats for making it that far) has outtakes which consists mostly of the actors forgetting their lines. Better than the main feature. Horrible movie not even worthy of SyFy/Asylum.

Technical issues: Dinosaurs are more related to birds than reptiles, so using a reptile model doesn't make any sense. You can not get a decent seal on a negative pressure respirator with facial hair. However in this case it really didn't matter because the budget didn't allow them to buy filters for the respirators, making them useless with a seal. If you are going to wear a Tyvex suit to protect you from chemicals, you really should have the feet in them. Why not mount cameras in the hanger with the T-Rex?

Guide: 1 F-word. No sex or nudity. The killing is off screen.",1474761600,3,1000,4.708571428571428

8762018,1,B01G24WLE0,"I expect movies like this one to be campy, but this one is lame. It ends after 68 minutes. The ending is abrupt and the movie itself is like it was done for a collage project and they ended it because they ran out of money, or they did not know how to follow through to the end.",1502582400,3,278,3.810344827586207

It far exceeded my expectations",1501718400,,56,4.181818181818182
8762020,1,B01G24WLE0,"i want this hour of my life back. the Dino didn't do anything cool, i would have been more entertained if they had used a lamp. i do not recommend this movie to anyone.",1501372800,3,168,3.9705882352941178
8762021,1,B01G24WLE0,Fortunately very short - about 70 minutes of totally predictable story line.,1500249600,,76,5.416666666666667
8762022,1,B01G24WLE0,"The ""research laboratory"" was your basic run of the mill office building. The ""cloning chamber"" was nothing more than a storage shed. They ""cloned"" the dinosaur by ""3d printing a crocodile over a trex skeleton"". One scene the researcher is telling everyone to wear gas masks but no one does for the rest of the film. Not worth it.",1500163200,,330,4.610169491525424
8762023,3,B01G24WLE0,2.5 stars.  It would have been three if they actually CGI'd a full T Rex instead of just the head inside a fog filled room.  The acting was passable.,1500163200,,149,4.103448275862069
8762024,1,B01G24WLE0,"Watched for 5 minutes,  could not stand it.  My 6 years old son can make a better movie than this.",1499731200,2,98,3.85
8762025,1,B01G24WLE0,"This is a SyFy movie. Whether it is or it isn't, it is. On a scale of 10 for SyFy movies, I give it a two. First thing that tipped me off were the gas masks. Without the canisters (that were obviously missing), they do nothing.",1498521600,2,227,3.9565217391304346
