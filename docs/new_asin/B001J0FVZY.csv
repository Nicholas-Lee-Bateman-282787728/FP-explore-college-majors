3650368,5,B001J0FVZY,"My kids, 2 & 6, love Tom & Jerry.  My wife & I enjoy the movies with them. Both movies are equally good.  They have watched them several times already!",1297123200,,151,4.0
3650369,5,B001J0FVZY,My daughter says these are her two favorite Tom and Jerry movies and they deserve 5 stars. My only comment is the disk itself has no cover art so looks like a blank dvd. One side is Fast and the Furry and the reverse side is Blast Off to Mars.,1280275200,3,243,3.88
3650370,4,B001J0FVZY,"The Fast and the Furry is my son's favorite, probably has something to do with the cars.  It's classic Tom and Jerry hijinks with neither of them able to talk.  The plot is fairly simple: Tom and Jerry have leveled Tom's owner's house with their chasing and destruction, they see a chance on tv for the winner of a car race around the world to get a new house.  Both want it so Tom and Jerry create their cars from a junk yard and off they go.  All the characters in the movie are fun and silly - lots of visual gags.
Blast off to Mars is not as good as The Fast and the Furry, but it's still a fun space adventure movie with silly characters and visual gags.",1262649600,4,659,4.046153846153846

8311629,3,B001J0FVZY,"This review is for the physical item shipped by Amazon. If you are after a ""pure"" movie review I recommend you also see the The Internet Movie Database.

The case for this DVD is environmentally damaging.

The DVD case is full of holes, is lightweight and flimsy. This of course, requires the case to be replaced with a more substantial one (with no holes) and the original case goes into a landfill.  If a sturdier case with no holes were used this senseless waste could be avoided.

Unlike other reviewers, I got both movies.  We enjoyed the movies very much.  Highly recommend for kids of all ages.  Excellent picture and sound.",1418860800,,631,4.63063063063063
