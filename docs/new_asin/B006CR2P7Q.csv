Tarantino's directorial efforts made GRAVE DANGER rock.",1327622400,7,164,5.346153846153846

I'm willing to pay for this I just don't get why we only have 2 seasons.",1327363200,,243,3.6923076923076925

8496558,4,B006CR2P7Q,"I've never been a CSI fan (too absurd in it's depictions of how the CSI operates is what turns me off), but it was entertaining enough to keep me interested, boasting some pretty fun characters and decent drama. But, when I reached season 5, I saw something that caught my eye immediately, and that was the director and co-writer credit for the finale; the legendary Quentin Tarantino! This immediately blew me away, because, why would Tarantino do a CSI two-part finale? After watching it, I knew exactly why.

When Nick Stokes, one of the main team members, is kidnapped after examining a crime scene, he is then held for a million-dollar ransom inside a buried coffin. With the rest of the team fighting to uncover who is behind the kidnapping, it starts to become apparent that this isn't just a ransom.

Tarantino brings his signature vibe and finesse to CSI, attention to detail, story-building, the works. There are even many moments in this two-parter that are eerily similar to Kill Bill, like a black & white autopsy and non-linear story-telling. Now, for those who are just here for Tarantino, there isn't much in the way of character development, other than the impending sense of urgency and unbearable tension. The cinematography, editing, production, everything from a behind-the-scenes perspective is straight-up Tarantino, just shrouded in a CSI story, but thankfully one that deserved a heavy hand and a thorough eye for extreme detail. This is a must-own for Tarantino completionists and CSI fans, and while the episode is included in the Season 5 DVD, the blu-ray looks and sounds great, and has a good behind-the-scenes featurette featuring the man himself.",1445731200,,1678,5.032374100719425

8496560,5,B006CR2P7Q,"Sure, it's the exact same episode that you can get on the series season 5 DVD set, but let's face it, it's one of the best episodes of the entire show and fun to watch nice, crisp and commercial free for those of us that have a Blu-ray player.",1377734400,,243,3.979591836734694
8496561,5,B006CR2P7Q,I have seen it on TV. Needless to say I watched it over and over again. It is a very good story.,1355788800,,96,3.409090909090909
8496562,4,B006CR2P7Q,"Fans of the TV series CSI (the first one set in Vegas) are dedicated fans. Who would have guessed that among those many fans was director Quentin Tarantino? It turns out he was a die hard fan of the series so when they called back in 2005 and asked if he'd be interested in directing an episode he jumped at the chance.

This presented something new for the director. Rather than hash out who the characters were he was about to direct he was walking into a group of actors who were as well versed in their characters as he was. The same held true of the crew for the series. This was a family atmosphere Tarantino was walking into and not one that he was a part of. But he blended in immediately and was welcomed by the entire ensemble. The result was an episode that when the dailies came in the folks behind the show opted to make it a two part episode rather than cut anything they found it so good.

The episode begins with CSI officer Nick Stokes (George Eads) being called to a crime scene. The officer on hand shows him a pile of what looks like intestines with a small blood trail. It's enough to make the officer puke but Stokes passed that reaction long ago. As he follows the trail of evidence away from the initial scene he's chloroformed and kidnapped. He wakes to find himself buried in a glass coffin beneath the ground with a tape recorder and an automatic pistol.

Word reaches the CSI headquarters and no money or manpower is spared. They process the scene to find clues to lead them to rescue Nick. It's not long before word reaches the group along with a thumb drive that provides them a link. When it requests them to watch, it switches on lights and a camera in the coffin so they can see Nick suffering.

Nick's parents are contacted and they begin to try and raise the million dollars for the ransom of Nick. Knowing they won't be able to do so in time, Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) contacts her casino owning father for the funds. While you would think a simple transaction between CSI leader Gil Grissom (William Peterson) and the kidnapper (John Saxon) would by simple it is far from it. Rather than take the money, Saxon blows himself up. Once more the CSI team must sift through the clues they find in the hopes that they can rescue Nick before his air runs out.

This episode was different than most in that it first involves a member of the CSI team as a victim rather than just an investigator. That allows the cast to offer something more than usual. While they might be seeking justice for others throughout the show, this time it becomes personal. This time we are allowed to see more emotions play out instead of the cold veneer that is usually displayed at crimes scenes they go to. Sure they care at each one, but this is one of their own.

I can't recall ever seeing an episode of CSI where the acting wasn't among the best available on television. And as the series has progressed it's as if these actors were portraying themselves as opposed to characters. But the truth is they are acting and doing it better than many actors around. Each one offers something new to their roles in this episode and Eads displays more emotional depth than he'd been allowed to previously. To show the fear of dying buried alive could be played over the top but here he offers a fear that you feel in your bones.

So does Tarantino make this one his own? In some ways. There are scenes that play like pieces of his films, one of which was improvised by actors Eads and Gary Dourdan as Warrick Brown. It takes place in the CSI locker room and they have a back and forth discussion about their lives that Dourdan says was their moment to do a Tarantino riff much like the ""royale with cheese"" moment in PULP FICTION.

Fans of the series will want to make sure they add this one to their collection. Not just to complete it but to make sure they have all the extras they could hope for involving cast interviews and more. Having it on blu-ray only makes it better. And for Tarantino fans who want to own everything he's ever done, this is your chance to own the show without having to fork out for the entire series.",1332201600,,4139,4.387222946544981
8496563,5,B006CR2P7Q,This particular CSI movie is well worth watching due to the suspense alone. Then add in Nick Stokes being the abducted. The crew must work with every bit of effort and knowledge they have to rescue the victim in time. During that rescue time a lot of other bad things happen to the victim. A must see for any CSI fan.,1328745600,,317,4.213114754098361
8496564,5,B006CR2P7Q,This season finale episode of CSI is the best episode of the series thus far. Quentin Tarentino did a great job directing the episode. George Eads as Nick Stokes did some of his best work ever.,1328400000,,193,4.388888888888889
8496565,5,B006CR2P7Q,"Probably the best ever CSI--should have been a movie! However, the star of this show is George Eads, WILLIAM PETERSEN--not Laurence Fishburne--, and the rest of the original cast.",1328227200,9,179,5.206896551724138
8496566,1,B006CR2P7Q,"I am a huge CSI fan, and not much of a Tarantino fan though. Having said that i very much enjoyed the Grave Danger episodes of CSI. They were well paced, full of intense thrills, and you really feel for the CSI agent in peril throughout the episode. It was well done...back in when this first aired. This release is actually episodes Grave Danger parts 1 and 2 from the last two episodes of season 5.

So here is the big question...what is this relaease all about then? This is a blatant cash in on the CSI and Trantino names for more money, just on a new format. It's just these two episodes re-re-relaesed on Blu Ray. These 2 episodes have already been previously released on a stand alone DVD back in 2005, which was bad enough. You can also simply buy Season 5 of CSI for less than $20 or get it used for less than $10 and get these exact same two episodes, plus an entire season of the show. Why pay $20 for just 2 episodes, at $10 per an episode when you can get a whole season at half that price? It's not like there is a bunch of next level CGI in the show that is going to look out of this world in Blu-ray, or that the current CGI has even been remastered to look good on high def. They are not even adding any speacial features like commnetaries by Tarantino or George Eads, or deleted scenes to spice up the release. There is no new content, and nothing is new or different, except maybe your bank account balance after your purchase.

Note: Amazon incorrectly lists Laurence Fishburne as an actor on this release, when in fact he was not on the show at this time, William Petersen was.

Save your money and buy whole seasons of this show, it is very much worth it. These two were not the only great ones of the series that were made.  I'd love to see CSI on blu-ray...all of the show. Dont be fooled by big names and high price tags on a blatant cash-in release.",1328140800,29,1875,4.2
