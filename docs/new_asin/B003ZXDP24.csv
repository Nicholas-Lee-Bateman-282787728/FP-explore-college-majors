8411235,4,B003ZXDP24,"Well produced film on the Mirabal sisters, martys of revolution against the despot Rafael Trujillo. Michelle Rodriguez seemed fairly comfortable in the lead role and carries the movie. The character of Trujillo, played by Juan Fernandez, as others have stated had a little too much makeup on. Although I believe he is an under rated actor. I remember he did a good job in SHOW OF FORCE, a political drama based in Puerto Rico, where he played a Police Captain. The plot was cohesive and did not veer off topic ver much with the major exception of the prisoner torture scenes which, while probably true historically, were over the top and excessive in light of the rest of the plot. This movie is a GREAT addition to collectors or fans of latin political thrillers, which I am. Hollywood needs to make more of these types of movies as they educate and entertain deeper thinkers.",1432080000,,877,4.701298701298701

8411239,5,B003ZXDP24,"I have read in the time of the butterflies and followed the Mirabal sisters story this movie is absolutely amazing, I did watch it in Spanish and Michele is super great. Trujillo's character is sarcastic and the make up it's just as he was in pretending to be ""white"". The movie is great!!  A must watch",1416355200,,303,4.410714285714286
8411240,4,B003ZXDP24,"This is an amazing film, and arrived in mint condition. I gave the film itself 4 stars because, while it is an amazing amazing film, there were scenes that were very violent and some scenes that were kind of slow. The overall film is a must see if you know anything about Trujillo's reign and the freedom fighters known as the Mirabal sisters. It's a film that definitely involves the viewer and accurately portrays the political regime of the time. Well acted, well created, if a little gory. Give it a watch.",1389139200,,510,4.554347826086956
8411241,2,B003ZXDP24,"I bought this movie with high hopes.  I wanted to show my students a more ""realistic"" account of the lives and deaths of the Mirabel sisters.  We read, In The Time of the Butterflies and watched the movie but it left me and my students wanting more.  I found this movie and was really hoping it would show how gutsy and strong these sisters were.  The story was good and I really loved that they filmed in the DR and used the only surviving sister, Dede, in the film.  I hated the bad voiceovers and the horrible makeup and acting by some of the actors.  The man that played Trujillo looked like he had on way too much makeup and was more funny than fearful.  The editing was not great and made the film seem choppy.  The death scene and some of the prison scenes were great.  I really wanted to love this movie but found myself cringing at how poorly made it was.  I would rather the film be in Spanish with english subtitles than have HORRIBLE english voiceovers that do not match the moods, emotions or physical attibutes of the characters.",1337558400,2,1043,4.357512953367876
8411242,5,B003ZXDP24,I watched this movie several times and it is one that I say keep in your collection. The movie is well written and a true account of the life and times for a family and the people living in the Dominican Republic.,1321228800,,213,4.095238095238095
