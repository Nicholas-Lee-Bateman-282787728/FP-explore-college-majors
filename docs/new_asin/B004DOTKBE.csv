4334314,4,B004DOTKBE,"The first thing that truly surprised me was the quality is excellent in all these movies, with the exception of Pom Pom Girls, but even with that movie the quality was far from awful. No crappy VHS transfers here. I'm the type of guy that likes USA up all night movies, beach/bikini movies, an low budget sci-fi films.
I thought 4 of these films were great views!(Silencer, Van Nuys Blvd, Killpoint, an Skydivers) If you like Plan 9 or MST3, you'll love Skydivers. Van Nuys is in my top 3 of all time great beach/t&a movies(aside from Pinball Summer an Hardbodies). Imagine Killpoint as a 80's action movie on steroids, nothing but action.
Top Cop, Nine Deaths, an Low Blow are in the same wagon as Killpoint, but less action. They are good, not great.
The Patriot and Scorpion(which is more suspense than action) are quite a bore to sit through, the Patriot being less entertaining.
The Hostage is all drama, its a very good film I might add, but it feels like it shouldn't be in this collection.
Iron Angel is the most bizarre war movie I've seen, the females stripping in 2 separate parts of the film is interesting to watch, you didn't really see that happen in a mid-60's movie.
Terror in the Jungle is the worst film in this collection. It is bizarre(especially the ending with the lion!) but a bore to sit through.
Highly Recommend. I was surprised this pack was this damn good.",1380153600,,1385,4.566265060240964
4334315,3,B004DOTKBE,"When you watch a movie produced by Crown International Pictures, you're guaranteed the movie will be trash.  Trashy movies are not always bad, however:  sometimes, they have a camp value that makes them so bad, they're good.  In the 12 movies collection Explosive Cinema, some of the films have that elusively entertaining quality.  Unfortunately, around half the movies are just plain bad.

By happy fortune, I happened to catch the worst of the bunch early in the set, allowing me to get them out of the way.  Killpoint and Low Blow are two awful action movies starring Leo Fong who is pretty much forgotten today.  Actually, since I watched these movies a few months ago (I took my time with this set), I can hardly remember what these movies were about, just that they were cheap knockoffs of 1980s style crime movies.  Similarly atrocious are Nine Deaths of the Ninja, The Patriot and Scorpion, but by far the worst in the bunch is Top Cop, starring some lumpy,  Dirty Harry sort who shoots first and never bothers to ask questions.  I suppose you could get a nice drinking game out of these movies with a shot for every cliche, but you'd risk alcohol poisoning.

Of the remaining half-dozen, there is something of an improvement.  The Silencer, the tale of a female assassin, is pretty weak too, but at least is depicted in a bit of an off-beat (if illogical) manner.  Van Nuys Blvd. is a teen sex comedy that I'd seen as part of another Crown set; I'm not sure what it's doing in an action movie set, but it is a pleasant lightweight diversion.  Iron Angel is a competently made Korean War story; it's not particulary exciting but it has its moments.

The Skydivers is one of three films that was made by Coleman Francis, one of the all-time worst movie directors (the other two were Red Zone Cuba and The Beast of Yucca Flats; all three have been featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000).  Amazingly, this might be the best of the three, but it's still entertainingly awful, a wonderful mixture of bad directing, non-existent acting and half-hearted writing (not to mention all sorts of continuity problems).

The last pair of movies deal with kid-in-jeopardy movies.  The Hostage has a dim-witted boy taken prisoner by a pair of movers/crooks.  Actually, he just got himself locked in their truck.  At least Harry Dean Stanton is in it, in one of his earliest roles.  Finally, there is Terror in the Jungle, a hilariously bad movie that has to be seen to be believed.  It starts as an Airport-style disaster movie with all sorts of characters introduced, including some cheesy rock stars, a recently acquitted black widow, an aspiring actress and a couple nuns.  You'd think, given all the background we get on these characters, they'd be important, but they all die early in the movie. (Did the directors change their minds midway through the story?)  The only survivor of the plane crash is a five(?)-year-old boy who is constantly crying.  He is taken prisoner by a tribe that thinks (because he is blond) that he is a son of the Sun God.  Eventually, there will be some dissent, leading to his life being threatened and saved in a manner I wouldn't want to give away.

Often times, I give these sets four or five stars because I enjoy good ""bad"" movies.  This set, however, really only offers a few that fit in that category.  The rest are just a waste of time, so I had to give the set as a whole a lesser rank.  It might be worth picking up if you're into trash films, but I would watch these movies selectively.",1335744000,,3528,4.61637239165329
4334316,3,B004DOTKBE,"I'm starting my own ""Action-Hosting"" show on public access - much like ""Horror-Hosting"" where they show horror movies that are in public domain. Good 'ol Mill Creek always puts out these great box sets of public domain flicks. Almost all of these movies are just right. Scorpion, Top Cop, and the rest are real cheeseball action flicks that most people didn't rent at the video stores back when the movies were new. The only one that doesn't belong in this box set is Van Nuys Blvd. and this is because it's NOT an action movie whatsoever. There are a few other good public domain movies they could have put into the set like Tough To Kill - but I digress.
These movies are great if you're the type to sit with friends, eat some Burger King and/or Pizza Hut, and watch movies that are so bad they're good and just laugh at them in the process.",1313107200,3,843,4.410256410256411
4334317,3,B004DOTKBE,12 ultra bad action film guaranteed to make you fall out of your lazy boy from laughter. The Two with Cameron Mitchell are the best because he is so insane but Terror In The Jungle also gets big thumbs up for the most WTF? ending I have ever seen.,1309564800,2,247,4.061224489795919
4334318,4,B004DOTKBE,"THE HOSTAGE: A pesky lil' snot crawls into the back of a moving truck driven by two career criminals. He sees them bury a body. They discover him. Hijinx ensue. As you can see this is copied closely from John Steinbeck's OF MICE & MEN except that the big guy is also the smart guy AND a psychotic killer and the little guy is Harry Dean Stanton. It's not bad.

IRON ANGEL: This movie is about a patrol behind enemy lines in Korea, looking to knock out an enemy mortar. The action is so-so and alot of time is filled with flashbacks of the G.I.'s partying in happier times with strippers that look like they've lived VERY hard lives. If you miss this you're not missing much.

KILLPOINT: This flick is a Cameron Mitchell tour de force! He stars as Joe Marks, a biker/criminal/entrepreneur/ poodle enthusiast who brings down the wrath of a cop after wiping out the cop's family during one of Cameron's ""business dealings"". Cameron is fantastic in this movie. He's weird, menacing and most of all entertaining. Leo Fong and Richard Roundtree are the good guys, although they're not nearly as much fun as Cameron and his poodle, Sparky.

LOW BLOW: A spoiled little rich ninny joins a cult and her rich daddy hires Leo Fong to bring her back. What follows is an exercise in raw 80's movie badness. Little in this movie makes any sense, yet it still managed to entertain me. Highlights include: The random puppy incident, the toughman contest, the sandwich shop fight scene,  all other fight scenes, after which Joe is never  questioned by police despite killing 5 or 6 people each fight, the lack of contact with any of the punches and kicks  and the scene where Joe punches a man in the face, exploding it.

NINE DEATHS OF THE NINJA: This is the most hilarious ninja movie I've ever seen. Sho Kosugi stars as ""Lollipop""(because he loves lollipops) the leader of a Special Forces team known as DART. He and his team are called to rescue a busload of kids who've been taken hostage by terrorists. Obstacles in the way include a team of midget assassins, a lesbian militia leader with a mullet and a crazy wheel chair bound Nazi.

THE PATRIOT: This is a terrible actioner about nuclear arms smuggling. It was a complete waste of the talents of stars Leslie Nielsen, Michael J. Pollard and TAXI's Jeff Conaway.

 SCORPION: Tony Tulleners plays a crack agent who tracks international terrorists. In real life Tulleners beat Chuck Norris in an actual karate match. Other than that it's completely unremarkable. I'm falling asleep just thinking about it.

THE SILENCER: A hit woman named Angel is contracted to kill five scumbags involved in child prostitution. Afterwards she wants to retire with her new fella to a peaceful, non-slaughtering life in the country. Not much really happens though.  The most amusing thing about this movie is that, ironically,  talk show gasbag Morton Downey Jr. is involved in a movie called The Silencer.

THE SKYDIVERS: Harry and Beth are a married couple who run an airfield that caters to parachutists. They're having marriage problems. Harry is cheating on Beth with Suzy, who has a thing for Frankie, Harry's former mechanic. Joe, an old army buddy, comes to work for Harry and falls for Beth. Meanwhile, Suzy and Frankie devise a way to knock off Harry, since their white hot rage burns so brightly. There's also some skydiving.

TERROR IN THE JUNGLE: A plane crashes into the Amazon, killing everyone except for a young boy who was traveling alone. A tribe of natives discover the boy and revere him due to his golden hair. As the high priest plans to sacrifice the lad, the boy's father desperately searches the jungle for him. If you like to pick on movies, this one is for you. It's pretty terrible.

TOP COP: Down in Arkansas a rebel cop who plays by his own rules takes down a smug drug kingpin. If your name is Larry the Cable Guy, this is your DIE HARD.

VAN NYS BLVD. A country bumpkin hears stories about what a swinging place the titular thoroughfare is and loads up his Beverly Hillbillies-mobile and heads off to find adventure! It features a few Playboy Playmates as well as plenty of drinkin', drivin' and sexin'.",1291075200,25,4157,4.680384087791495

8425838,5,B004DOTKBE,"Hmmm. This 12-Movie (on 3 DVD Discs) set DELIVERS the goods. It almost seems like Mill Creek accidentally compiled TOO MANY quality ""Drive-In Action Classics"" into one collection (not to mention quietly; I found this while lost in the jungle during a confusing hunt for an elusive brand of shoe-paper on Amazon and for that reason alone I suggest if you have landed on this page you have done the next best thing to landing on the moon so click this gem into your shopping cart and sleep easier tonight).

Most if not all seem to come from their licensing alliance with the almighty Crown International Pictures, and any lover of low-to-medium budget grindhouse-a-rooni fun knows that that means that this is cause for a celebration in the abundance/embarrassment of riches department.

The only film in this set that I had previously seen was the thoroughly enjoyable ""Van Nuys Blvd."", so that still left 11 movies to banish the doldrums of a mediocre afternoon/evening/existence.

These range from the 60's to the 80's, but era-phobes should not fear the keeper (full disclosure: I just nicknamed this set ""the keeper"" in order to make an extremely lame joke utilizing a reference to that old chestnut of a Blue Oyster Cult anthem from yesteryear and yes I have to admit I am somewhat ashamed to be using a cheap and obvious device like that to get my point across but I couldn't help myself).

Ahem. Do you require star-power for your B-Movie thrills? This gives you Richard Roundtree! Harry Dean Stanton! Cameron Mitchell! Lynette Walden! And many, many, many, many, many, many, moreand a few others.

Go buy this now. You don't want to? Okay. You, over there in a faraway place; you already did buy it and you never even finished reading this fascinating review? Even better. You gotta JUMP on an Action film (before it ambushes you). Sometimes they even get away from you and if you think what you missed won't hurt you, you may be right but when I think how much this collection changed my life I weep at your misfortune, for you might always be the same.",1509667200,,2062,4.716666666666667
