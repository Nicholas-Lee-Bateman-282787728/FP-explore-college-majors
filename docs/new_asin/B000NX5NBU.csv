2788181,5,B000NX5NBU,"This movie is wicked cool. I saw it last year at some Indie film festival, where most of the other movies were complete wastes. Seriously though. I thought the camera work, writing, acting, etc. were sweet. I mean, it was pretty awesome how even the lighting of the movie reflected the 'blue' atmosphere. Favorite shot: when all three guys stand together watching the storm brewing. Anyhoo, if I had to choose between watching this or the Departed, I'd probably choose the Departed... but, this really is a great movie.",1173657600,,519,4.842696629213483
2788182,5,B000NX5NBU,"As a movie goer I found this movie beautiful and powerfuland a good story of Minae and its lobstermen. Moreover, as a therapist, it gives a sad but very realistic portrayal of what families go through with a member who has Altzheimers and what can be done during this difficult period. I hope that it will find a broad audience that appreciates both aspects.",1173571200,2,358,4.609375
2788183,5,B000NX5NBU,"I really enjoyed this film - so much in fact that I have watched it several times. The three main actors, as the Pritchard men, deliver brilliant performances. This movie is so engrossing because the characters are dealing with very real issues: financial hardships, unrealized potential, love, and loss. Costal Maine provides the perfect backdrop for this drama.",1173312000,,363,5.275862068965517
2788184,5,B000NX5NBU,"Sundowning unfolds subtly, with a patience and sensitivity that seems nearly extinct in today's cinema. The movie's pace and nuanced treatment pays homage to its subject matter as well as to its audience. What a pleasure. It's an extraordinary accomplishment with an extraordinary cast.",1173312000,,286,5.5227272727272725
2788185,5,B000NX5NBU,"I saw this film twice now, and both times were equally enjoyable.  I was amazed at the quality of the script.  The actors portrayed likeable (and not so likeable at times) characters, and did so with relative ease.  I would highly recommend this movie to any general movie-goer.

2 thumbs up!",1173312000,,292,4.666666666666667
2788186,5,B000NX5NBU,"One of the best made ""New England"" based films I've seen.  I saw it when it was shown in Ellsworth, Maine and was impressed the by strength of the story it told.  Like many other ""Made in Maine"" films it shows off the incredible beauty of the area I live in, but unlike a lot of the rest it has stuck with me.  Definitely worth seeing!",1173225600,,335,4.045454545454546
2788187,5,B000NX5NBU,"My mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's about eight years ago, so this movie really touched my heart.  It's not often that you walk away from watching a movie feeling like you've lived it and can actually relate to the story.  I found it very enlightening and extremely well done.  I highly recommend it to everyone who has been touched by this disease or who wants to better understand what Alzheimer's is about.",1173225600,,414,4.722222222222222
2788188,5,B000NX5NBU,"""Sundowning"" is a fictional story, not a documentary, but it succeeds in an extraordinary way in conveying the challenges and issues confronting families and other caregivers dealing with Alzheimer's patients.  A first film by a young Maine filmmaker, ""Sundowning"" won awards at several major film festivals before having its commercial debut at a theater in Portland, where word of mouth resulted in repeated sellouts.  Since then, ""Sundowning"" has been used and promoted as a teaching film by the Maine Alzheimer's Association (which also used it for a benefit event) and by nursing homes, churches and others dealing with Alzheimer's patients and issues.  This can be an emotionally wrenching film at times, with its bluntly realistic depiction of the travails of families confronting this tragic disease, but it prepares the viewer extremely well for understanding what is required of family members and caregivers, all in the context of a well-written, beautifully filmed story with remarkable performances across the board.  As one whose own family dealt with Alzheimer's firsthand, and now does yet again, I cannot recommend this film too highly!",1173139200,,1153,5.424581005586592
8182262,5,B000NX5NBU,"This movie is an outstanding depiction of the many faces of Alzheimer's.  I acquired my copy for use in a hospice resource library.  Having worked with many Alzheimer's patients and those affected by this terrible disease, I found a sad familiarity in the difficulties the characters of this movie faced.  The awards and accolades ""Sundowning"" has received are well deserved.",1295913600,,375,5.216666666666667
8182263,5,B000NX5NBU,"This movie is amazing!  Whether or not you know someone with Alzheimer or dementia, you will be touched by this heartfelt story.  As a daughter of a parent with dementia, I know first-hand of the difficulties the characters went though - this is a wonderful portrayal of the realities of the situation.  You cannot help but be brought to tears.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.  Its a wonderful story with beautiful views and great directing and acting.  You will not be let down.",1174262400,,488,4.682352941176471
8182264,5,B000NX5NBU,"If you appreciate visually captivating cinematography and top-notch acting, this spellbinding tale about three generations of Maine lobsterman is just your vintage. I loved this movie and have no doubt that you'll be impressed.",1174089600,,227,5.705882352941177
8182265,5,B000NX5NBU,An extremely well crafted and beautifully shot small film. Big budget films should take lessons from these guys. As an industry participant I can really appreciate the acting and the artistry that went into this project. Sundowning is very moving and engaging.,1173916800,,260,5.214285714285714
8182266,5,B000NX5NBU,"You will love this movie.  I did. You can identify with every character, from the stubborn dementia-suffering patriarch of a three generation lobstering family to his grandson whose loyalty to the family will break your heart.  The scenery is amazing, with many great shots of the characters actually out on a lobster boat. All three main characters are great actors -- very convincing in their plight. A powerful, impressive film.",1173830400,3,431,5.142857142857143
8182267,5,B000NX5NBU,"The amount of people with Alzheimer's disease has more than doubled over the last couple of decades. I applaud the makers of this film for bringing this very serious and growing issue to light.  The film does a brilliant job at capturing the very real and raw emotions of Alzheimer's victims and their families through the tastefully written and engaging story of Maine lobstermen. Through trials, tribulations and difficult truths, three generations of men (grandfather, father and son) pull together for support. Even if you do not know someone who has suffered from this illness, this film will touch you to tears.  It's a must see.",1173830400,3,635,4.981132075471698
8182268,4,B000NX5NBU,"I have worked in the field of aging for over 20 years.  Few films begin to touch the issues that families face when dealing with an Alzheimer's-like dementia diagnosis.  Although all situations are different, the film makers do a nice job of portraying a real life-like family situation and their reaction to this disease and the implications on the family dynamics.",1173744000,,366,4.983606557377049
8182269,5,B000NX5NBU,"Wow! A great movie with lots of meaning. Also very touching.  You can tell the producers, actors and all involved did their research on the topic.  It would be a great movie for anyone who knows or is involved with someone crippled with this disease.  I have watched it many times.",1173657600,,281,4.470588235294118
8182270,5,B000NX5NBU,"Sundowning is an unrelenting portrayal of the sacrifices we make for family; made all the more compelling as seen through the eyes of three generations of lobstermen.  In a sea of machismo, repressed emotion and scant communication Sundowning delivers meaningful, plainspoken messages.  A beautifully shot film with powerful performances by all members of the Pritchard family.  I highly recommend this piece of work.",1173657600,,417,5.587301587301587
8182271,5,B000NX5NBU,"Congratulations to Cole and cast.  I can count on half of one hand the number of movies I've seen that are able to erase so artfully the lines between age-classes that we tend to draw in our society.  This may be the best.  Sundowning speaks to the youthful and the aged with equal respect and insight in a beautifully photographed film and it does so on a small, indy budget which itself is a declarative statement about movie-making. Minor Rootes delivers a stunning performance of the classically styled patriach whose decline into dementia is a work of profound tragedy.  And yet, this story of three generations of fishermen who hate to love each other delivers some beautifully soft moments as well.  If you're old, if you know someone old, or if someday you hope to be old - check out this flick.  I loved it.",1173657600,3,816,4.593103448275862
