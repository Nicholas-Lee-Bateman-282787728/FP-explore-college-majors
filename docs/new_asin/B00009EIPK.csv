7990877,1,B00009EIPK,The Irish Prayers-Unfortunately not what I expected. For the few bucks it cost it was worth a chance. VIdeo Tape Quality Church Group Folk Music. I had to give it a star to write the review.,1326326400,,190,4.305555555555555
7990878,5,B00009EIPK,"Like another reviewer, I first saw this through a rental copy from Netflix. It is repetitious chanting by three young men with a little bit of video from Ireland interspersed. The prayer chants come from the distant past and are beautiful in their simplicity. They hail back to the ancient monasteries and people in early Christian times. The scene is effectively set without artificial lighting. Accompanying musical sounds and basic acoustics deepen the experience. If you are familiar with other chant music and how it can lower blood pressure and induce a state of relaxation, then you already have an idea of what ""The Irish Prayers"" is like. What I can say further is that it is all of this and more. This is one of those rare items that I will give as gifts.",1303516800,,765,4.674074074074074
7990879,5,B00009EIPK,"I first watched the DVD Irish Prayers when I rented it from Netflix.  I liked it so much, that I decided to see if I could purchase it from Amazon.com.  They had it and only several copies left at a very reasonable price.  Since I have been to Ireland it was especially meaningful to me.  I have been battling an ongoing physical sickness for some months now and it helps me tremendously to listen to the soothing songs and ballads of the musicians and singers on this DVD.  I would recommend it for anyone needing solace and comfort.",1230595200,2,534,4.408163265306122
