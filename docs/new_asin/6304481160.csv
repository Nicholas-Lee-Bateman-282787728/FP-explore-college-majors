8283130,1,6304481160,"This is a rock video, ""music"" background and computer-generated artwork, but not to my taste.  Much of the artwork looked like animated two-dimensional impressionist paintings.  There were some 3-D images, but they weren't on screen long enough to appreciate them.  They made up for this lack by repeating the same scenes again and again.  This DVD might be OK as background for a party, something to be ignored most of the time; but watching it as a movie just gave me a headache.",1044230400,,481,4.759036144578313
