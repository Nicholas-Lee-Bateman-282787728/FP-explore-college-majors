5564696,4,B00B9LNQ3C,Great movie for a relaxing night in.  For a B movie this is a top 10. I really liked it.,1361923200,3,88,3.4
5564697,3,B00B9LNQ3C,"This movie is like a cross between cheech n chong and demon witch gone wild! Okay, back in the faraway past I was known to puff a bit myself but, seriously? This movie is totally crazy! An evil cannibal witch draws hapless victims into her web to draw their youth from them and THEN she eats them! But instead of luring HANSEL and GRETAL with ginger bread, the witch uses this mega ganga! Fun to watch with friends, but wouldn't watch it twice...enough said",1361750400,7,457,4.4523809523809526
5564698,5,B00B9LNQ3C,"Funny, awesome gore and Molly Quinn. What more could you ever need?
I was well entertained and the movie left me wanting more!

I enjoyed seeing Molly Quinn play a character different than Alexis Castle, it's nice to see her versatility, she held her own.
The other actors were good too, they played their characters well! People are so harsh on movies they expect them all the be award winning, this movie was fun and made me forget about my day. i enjoyed it and think everyone involved did a wonderful job!

Also Molly Quinn's wardrobe was very nice, she looked wonderful! Molly is such a talented, lovely, gorgeous young woman!

It was fun and gory in the Tucker and Dale vs Evil kinda way!

I already pre-ordered the dvd!",1361491200,3,726,4.561538461538461
5564699,4,B00B9LNQ3C,"If you're a Molly Quinn fan (from Castle) and like gore, you'll like this movie, lol. It was surprisingly suspenseful and kept me intrigued. I also thought Michael Welch (from Twilight movies) was the perfect choice for Hansel, but it was Bianca Saad's character who stole the show.",1361491200,7,282,4.895833333333333
5564720,5,B00B9LNQ3C,good movie great price,1474502400,,22,4.75
5564721,1,B00B9LNQ3C,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen--and that hurts me to write, because I know that Molly Quinn and the guy who played her brother really tried their hardest to make this piece-of-crap script worth something.  It was unnecessarily gross and there was a lot of torture...mostly for the viewer.",1473033600,2,298,4.730769230769231
5564722,5,B00B9LNQ3C,Funny and very well written,1469318400,,27,4.6

5564725,4,B00B9LNQ3C,"Much the same reflexive humor as Jack Hill's ""Spider Baby"",  which was made almost 60 years earlier.  So if you like an irreverent take on the genre this is a film to seek out.  Molly Quinn is an excellent choice for the heroine as she underplays her sexy Scream Queen character,  this contrasts nicely with Lara Flynn Boyle's over-the-top dialogue and allows the film to work on both a creepy and a humorous level.

And what would Hansel and Gretel be without: ""Let us drop these breadcrumbs so that together we find our way home.  Because losing our way would be the most cruel of things.""  In this case Gretel uses the candy skittles, not DXM or even breadcrumbs.

Lots of gratuitous gore if that is your idea of a good time.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1445731200,,776,4.401408450704225
5564726,3,B00B9LNQ3C,It was an ok movie...a little weird and sum head scratching but other than that it could have been a lot more to the movie itself.,1442620800,,130,4.038461538461538
5564727,5,B00B9LNQ3C,Quite nice to watch. Interesting variation to the story.,1442188800,,56,5.333333333333333
5564728,4,B00B9LNQ3C,"The story is as you would guess a modern day retelling of the classic Grimm story. Quite frankly I cannot believe it took this long to make this sort of movie because it just seems that the pot community and the story of Hansel & Gretel where meant for each other especially as seen in this film. Also don't let the comedy part through you off because this isn't one of those funny flicks that relies heavily on the spoof shtick blatant puns. The humor here only comes from the simple and expected funny s*** that stoner films are known for. Mostly this film stays with a classic 80s homage horror theme complete with gory effects, creepy build-ups and dark chilling overtures. The story is simple and interesting, leading into this sticky, gooey tale of a witch that lures children into her home so that she may eat them. Only this witch is the kind that you would really want to get high with and Lara Flynn Boyle plays the part perfectly. The slight nuances and interactions between her and other characters made it obvious that she enjoyed playing this role. The characters of Hansel and Gretel are also pretty believable on screen. The story manages to be witty and smart with plenty of representations from the classic fairytale present but in a very fresh concept. I mean seriously it seems as if this story should have been a no brainer years ago. I have to say if anyone dares to see any movie with Hansel & Gretel in the title make it this one! It manages to be a fun original spin on the concept without seeming hokey, plus the elements of horror are far more impressing than you may expect. It manages to use a darker wicked humor which brought the funny without the ridiculous. I plan to add this flick to my 4.20 celebration as the final piece on my day of horror to get high with!",1433462400,,1795,4.442424242424242
5564729,5,B00B9LNQ3C,"This movie is more fun than a barrel of stoned monkeys. The acting and effects are excellent for a low-budget film, and the complications and twists will keep you glued to your seat. I lived thru the 60s and survived. I saw some of my old friends reflected in the characters.",1417996800,,275,4.411764705882353
5564730,5,B00B9LNQ3C,"The movies is well scripted and had numerous scenes of comedy, horror, and drama, overall we loved the movie.",1413849600,,109,4.7894736842105265
5564731,5,B00B9LNQ3C,Omg I got the package super quick thanks again love the movie bye the way,1412899200,,73,3.933333333333333
5564732,3,B00B9LNQ3C,"I different twist on Hensel & Gretal see's the story told as a modern day stoner movie... however, I would not exactly call it a stoner comedy, as more just a regular horror comedy. There is a couple of scenes I could imagine stoners probably freaking out if they where high, but provided you take a bit of gross gore, it's far from a movie I could imagine would make a druggie that's high trip out, so bare that in mind before seeing this if that was one of your assumptions about this movie.

Hansel and Gretal are typical valley teenagers. Gretal is a pothead, while her brother Hansel is the straight man. Gretals boyfriend is a huge dope smoker and they have just discovered the best weed they have ever tried called Black Forrest. They run out of pot and so the boyfriend takes off to buy some more from the source. He discovers a sweet little old lady is producing the grass and she invites him in for what seems like an innocent cup of hot tea and a bong, but things may not be as they appear with this sweet little old lady. After a few hours Gretal has not heard from her boyfriend and begins to look for him, with all clues leading back to the sweet little old drug dealing lady who says she has not seen her boyfriend at all.

Will it turn out like the old H&C story and the sweet little old lady is really an evil old wicked witch, or is Gretal just so high she's hallucinating the whole thing? You'll have to see the movie for yourself to find out.

I absolutely hate Twilight, but I could stand this film from start to end, so don't worry about witches sparkling or emo dialog. This film is nothing like Twilight or it's tones in anyway at all! I'm not sure I can compare this movie to something else off the top of my head, but it's not a dark sinister or scary film, it's just a bit of a supernatural fun comedy horror with a lot of marijuana in it. I myself am not a stoner, so I can tell you that you don't need to be a reefer addict to enjoy the film. As for seeing it again over and over again? Nah, once is enough. It's a decent rental to say the least, but I doubt you would want to own your own copy.",1403568000,,2124,4.113253012048193
5564733,3,B00B9LNQ3C,"It plays like a bad series pilot on The CW. It has an okay story..it's been done and rehashed so many times over, even in a modern setting. Nothing really stands out here, and Laura Flynn Boyle is just okay as the evil witch, but most of her dialogue is mumbled.. The whole thing is hard to sit though, not because of the gore, but because it fades in and out of boring moments. The ending was no big shocker either.",1402704000,,416,4.148148148148148
5564734,3,B00B9LNQ3C,With a title like Hansel & Gretel Get Baked I certainly didn't expect much more than a one star flick.  Drugs are used in place of candy to lure the teenagers to the witches lair.  Lara Flynn Boyle's performance was fun to watch and the dialogue that was written for her made the low budget movie bearable.,1401667200,,306,4.350877192982456
5564735,4,B00B9LNQ3C,"This movie is a great movie to watch while throwing a party. I thought it would be no better than a 'b' movie but amazingly it has good acting, excellent filmography and its funny, suspenseful all at the same time.  And since it's not hard to follow, you won't tell your overly indulged loud friends to shut up during the movie. Enjoy!",1400284800,2,335,4.403225806451613
5564736,4,B00B9LNQ3C,This is a good example of unneeded plastic surgery gone wrong. The movie could have been way better. Not that bad but could have been so much better with an imaginative director.,1400198400,,178,4.59375
5564737,4,B00B9LNQ3C,"Good movie,different than other suspense movies.  It's kinda strange but not in a bad way.  If you like horror movies this one has both suspense & horror.",1398211200,,154,4.666666666666667
5564738,1,B00B9LNQ3C,"This is not good cinema. Don't waste your time, unless you like bad movies with lots of gore.
I don't.",1395619200,,102,4.15
5564739,5,B00B9LNQ3C,"This movie is just great on so many levels! true it may have been shot on a low budget, but the story follows the original and then there are new interpretations such ad the black forest. its just an all around fun movie to watch, it may be sad; but i get a giggle out of lara flynn boyles bad girl antics.",1394150400,,306,3.9516129032258065
5564740,5,B00B9LNQ3C,"Hansel & Gretel Get Baked (called Hansel and Gretel & The 420 Witch out here in Australia for some reason), was simply a lot of fun.  A fairly short film at only 83 minutes but enjoyable the whole way.  If you're familiar with the original tale (as I imagine most people would be) this version set in modern time suburban LA does have its own story to tell but importantly for a good retelling, plays homage to the key moments of that classic fairy tale with modern substitutes or references such as the trail of bread crumbs becoming a trail of skittles, the gingerbread house being a desert dish on a table that a stoner with the munchies is told not to eat. Gretel even wears modern day versions of Black Forest Germany fairy tale era clothing, which I must say look quite good on her. Hansel & Gretel are certainly as close siblings as in the original.  The film though does mostly revolve around Gretel though, I would have liked to have seen Hansel play a bit more air time so to speak, the film was short enough to have lengthened his times in the witch's house for example.

Of course with the American title Hansel & Gretel Get Baked it's a little more obvious what the film is about than & the 420 Witch tells us out here.  Although I would point out ours is actually more accurate as Hansel doesn't seem to be a pot smoker at all, he seems to be more of a straight arrow so to speak, who watches out for his sister when she's baked. Which is also why it's a little disappointing he doesn't appear much in the second half of the film. Anyway I had no idea what this film was about when I came across it but thought a witch who instead of luring children into her house by it being made of candy instead is a dealer with an addictive and better blend of marijuana called Black Forest, was definitely was worth checking out and I am glad I did.

This is more of a comedy than a horror film, in fact the horror is very mild, if the plot didn't revolve around marijuana I'd even say it is more of a kid friendly horror angle.  But it's really more of a comedy and parody type film than a horror one.  The whole film is more of a tongue in cheek lets have fun with the fairy tale characters and situations themselves as well as stereotypes with other professions such as the police who stop at a doughnut shop, and the electricity meter reader whose mission it is to bring down a drug cartel and get those accolades at the start.  The film views like the cast were having a lot of fun and no one really expected movie watchers to take it too seriously.  Molly C Quinn does a brilliant job as Gretel, as does Lara Flynn Boyle as the witch, the two characters the rest of the cast revolve around.",1393027200,,2699,4.243664717348928
5564741,5,B00B9LNQ3C,"this movie is dope, like harold and kumar but black forest dark. i only wish i had seen it with baked goods of my own.",1392422400,,118,3.76

Hansel and Gretel Get Baked (2013) **1/2 / 4 -- Recommended viewing
D: Duane Journey
C: Lara Flynn Boyle, Michael Welch, Molly Quinn, Cary Elwes, Yancy Butler, Lochlyn Munro, Bianca Saad
P: A new marijuana strain called Black Forest is giving stoners the ultimate high. Turns out an evil witch is behind its production and she is preying upon her customers, even eating them (literally), in an effort to regain her youth and beauty.

One of the multiple releases that 2013 saw incorporating the Hansel and Gretel story. This one falls somewhere in the middle. It's not an abysmal failure like Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, but it doesn't particularly stand out either, though it is a fun & entertaining film.

This one scores some points for trying to do something different, trying to modernize the story and for it's clever integration of the Hansel and Gretel story. However, what stands out about the film is Lara Flynn Boyle. She's practically the whole show here. She eats up her role as the witch with relish and dominates every frames she is in. She brings life and energy to her role and to the film without ever going over the top. It's a showy role and she milks it for every dollar that it is worth. [Not Rated] 90 mins.",1384560000,,1321,4.70995670995671
5564743,5,B00B9LNQ3C,First of all i would give this movie a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10...however people seem to be saying its worse than it really is...come on its a stoner movie meets horror...i think the best stoner movie out there at the moment...could have been better minus a few cheesier moments but over all a very good flick.,1383091200,,309,4.166666666666667

5564745,3,B00B9LNQ3C,"better than i expected. pretty gruesome at times. funny moments. some hot chicks.

5564746,5,B00B9LNQ3C,Loved this movie. There needs to be more of this type made. Always fun to watch. Keeps your mind working!! Molly Quinn did an excellent performance...totally different role for her. It was nice to see another side of her!!,1376611200,,222,4.717948717948718
5564747,5,B00B9LNQ3C,A fun flick with some talented actors. Seen it twice so far and will see a few more times. You must be comfortable watching people high as kites though!,1375315200,,152,4.275862068965517
5564748,2,B00B9LNQ3C,"I enjoy twisted fairy tales; however, I am not a fan of stoner movies.  I was hoping the witch would eat everyone but alas it didn't happen.  I didn't really find the stoner jokes funny...yes I know when one gets stoned the munchies usually follow;;ha ha...but the jokes aren't new or funny and have been done way too many times in other movies.  Actually, I didn't care much for any of the characters except for the witch.  I found her amusing as she ate her way to a more younger looking woman.  I didn't understand why the witch had zombies...??  In the fairy tale the witch didn't have zombies but I suppose times are changing and a witch has to do what a witch has to do (the witch said something similar when zombies were mentioned in the flick)...anyhoo...the zombies didn't seem to belong in the movie,  I suppose they were thrown in so one could have his head chopped in two.  Cerebus also enters the picture except he isn't a 3 headed dog he is a pincher....I don't recall the witch having a dobie but..anyhoo...the film starts out a stoner comedy then turns into a stupid comedy with traces of fairy tale when Gretel's stoner boyfriend, Ashton, goes missing.  It is light on gore and suspense, some funny parts (mainly the snide comments of the witch) and no originality.  Sat through the entire film once but don't care to do it again.",1374278400,,1347,4.506172839506172

5564751,3,B00B9LNQ3C,"The plot is simple. Agnes (Lara Flynn Boyle) is a witch who grows some righteous weed called ""Black Forest"" that all the kids crave. She allows them into her house and extracts their youth from them, which causes their demise.

The film starts out like a fairly decent stoner film, break out the milk and gingerbread cookies. It has some decent comedy, dark comedy, and slasher moments. About half way through the film the writers got a block. I kept waiting for Hansel (Michael Welch) and Gretel(Molly C. Quinn) to come together and turn this into a good witch fight. As it turns out Hansel is a minor character while Molly has to carry the film by herself. Don't get me wrong, she did well for the lousy lines she was scripted, with her red hair and looks making me ache for Laura Prepon. It was a good idea that was squandered.

It may appeal to young kids (that absolutely shouldn't watch) because it is not adult funny or have a plot. Didn't watch the entire movie.
