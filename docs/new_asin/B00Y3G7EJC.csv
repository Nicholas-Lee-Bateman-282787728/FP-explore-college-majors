8717481,5,B00Y3G7EJC,Since I haven`t been able to see them live this was a must have. I`ve been a fan since finding their 2nd cd back around 2007.,1465257600,,125,3.8461538461538463
8717482,5,B00Y3G7EJC,"This is a fantastic Blu-Ray concert of Dragonforce.  I've been both hot and cold on Dragonforce over the years and I simply go through spells of amazement and wonder at the guitar shredding duo of Herman Li and Sam Totman.  Both of those guys own the guitar and are incredible at what they do.  This concert is amazing and features most of their ""hits"" over the years.  If you are a fan of guitar based music you really should give Dragonforce a shot if you haven't.  Picture quality and sound quality are excellent.  I do wish that the concert played straight through instead of pausing every couple of songs and showing some behind the scenes footage on tour.  It's a minor issue and I will count off on my rating due to a personal preference.  Comes with matching CD, making this a great value package.  I would recommend picking up if you are a fan of Dragonforce!",1453334400,,868,4.477707006369426

8717484,5,B00Y3G7EJC,If you like shred or guitar-centric rock/metal you'll probably like Dragonforce. Lot's of 80's style melodic shred acrobatics with decent vocals and catchy choruses. It's just a fun concert to watch or play in the background. The production and camera-work are on point and the camera actually zooms in on the lead guitarists during solos instead of zooming in on the bass player.,1441756800,,380,5.0476190476190474

8717487,5,B00Y3G7EJC,"I've been a diehard fan of DragonForce for about a year now, ever since I stumbled upon them on YouTube.
They have changed so much since they were first founded well over a decade ago. Members have come and gone, yet the force of a dragon is still there. Frankly, I think they've become much better. In my opinion, they have simpler, more memorable songs, slower and much more clear singing, and somehow the tempos are faster than ever. They're live performances have also become much stronger and much more emotional, I think.
Needless to say I really liked their choice of songs in this DVD. These include Valley of the Damned, which is an old yet enduring classic, with one of the greatest chord progressions I have ever heard and an amazing solo by Herman at the end. Or Ring of Fire, which I actually prefer over the original Johnny Cash version. Or my personal favorite, Tomorrow's Kings, an amazing and fun song with inspirational lyrics that motivated me to have so much fun in my life. And of course, there's their most famous song which I won't name because everyone reading this knows what it is.
For a live performance, I think this is much stronger and more powerful than the okay Twilight Dementia from a few years ago. They mixed some of their newer, evolved style with their older, enduring classics. And they even threw in a CD.
This was probably the best $20 I have spent in a long time. I don't regret it.
 DragonForce is the best.",1437004800,6,1450,4.534351145038168
8717488,5,B00Y3G7EJC,"I have been a fan of DragonForce since I had heard TtFaF on Guitar Hero. I have every album and have enjoyed each for the most part. In the Line of Fire was recorded in Japan during the Maximum Overload tour. They played 10 songs, including: Fury of the Storm, Black Winter Night, Symphony of the Night, Ring of Fire, Three Hammers, Seasons, Cry Thunder, Through The Fire and Flames, Valley of the Damned, and Tomorrow's Kings. Defenders was included on the CD. This wasn't a particularly long concert considering they added some videos from the band between a few songs.

The mix is great. You can clearly hear the instruments and vocals. I was happy to see more backing vocals. Marc's voice is phenomenal throughout, my favorites being Three Hammers and VotD. He's brought so much to the band. It was nice to see Sam and Herman sticking to the original solos and not improvising too much. I could not believe how they kept in sync during some of those solos. The guitar tapping/keyboard solo in Fury of the Storm was very cool. This is definitely the best I've heard DF live. They played well.

The band has so much energy and you can see they are having a blast. This is a must have for fans, and highly recommended to any power metal fans.",1436572800,10,1243,4.495575221238938
