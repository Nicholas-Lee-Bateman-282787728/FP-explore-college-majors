1524804,4,B00005JO4D,The TCM spotlight Errol Flynn collectional is a classic all forr movies are in excellent condition and i have no hesitation in recomending this collection to anyone especially Errol Flynn fans. I thought these four movies would never be available but her they are thanks to TCM,1282953600,3,277,4.914893617021277
1524805,5,B00005JO4D,"Great collection of Flynn films, but once again Amazon is $8.00 higher than
Barnes & Noble. They need to give more price considerations to classic film fans.",1281484800,4,157,4.851851851851852
1524806,4,B00005JO4D,"Errol Flynn was the Quintessential swashbuckler. He literally stormed onto the screen in 1935 and proceeded to give us Captain Blood (1935) , Major Vickers of the Light Brigade (1936), Robin Hood (1938), the Earl of Essex (1939), Privateer Geoffrey Thorpe aka ""The Seahawk"" (1940, and George Armstrong Custer (1941). Most of these he made with Michael Curtiz and Olivia de Havilland. He also made the westerns like Dodge City (1939), Virginia City (1940), and Santa fe Trail (1940) in which he exchanged the sword for the six shooter. But all along he yearned for films that required more ""acting"" and as the war came along, and Flynn found himself unable to enlist (due to a TB spot and recurring bouts of Malaria), he turned to the making of war films not only to extend his acting but to serve his adopted country.

Here in one collection are those films. They range in quality, not only with respect to the films but also to Flynn's acting. In some (e.g., Objective Burma) he is the old recognizable hero, while in others he pulls back the throttle (e.g., Edge of Darkness) and in others the old Flynn will not be recognizable (e.g., Uncertain Glory).

This is an absolute must for Flynn fans.

We see him here at the peak of his powers, trying to change course, but the strong currents of his past will be impossible to steer against. Ahead lay the rocks of obscurity and undistinguished roles, the descent into alcoholism and drug abuse, the failure of his multiple marriages, and the self-parody. Near the end, the sun will rise once more and he will finally get the chance to reach the shores he yearned for. But in this remarkable collection we get a glimpse of the giant before the fall.",1281484800,14,1697,4.65
1524807,5,B00005JO4D,"I have been waiting for years for this collection! Next to John Wayne, Errol Flynn was probably the most iconic screen persona of the 'wartime hero', and the screen's greatest swashbuckler made an inspiring spokesperson of allied wartime heroism...until his infamous 1942 rape trial revealed a more flawed, less heroic carouser and womanizer. Warner studio boss Jack Warner would be shocked and pleased that ticket sales for Flynn films didn't decline after the revelations, but Flynn's public image (and personal self-esteem) never truly recovered. So, in a sense, these five films show Flynn at the pinnacle of fame and success, sliding into his tragic decline...

""Desperate Journey"" (1942): Aussie co-pilot Flynn's disregard to his captain's orders to remain at high altitude on a bombing mission over Poland gets the plane shot down, the captain killed, and Flynn and crewmates Ronald Reagan, Alan Hale, Arthur Kennedy, and Ronald Sinclair pursued across Europe by stereotypical Nazi villain Raymond Massey, and the most inept collection of German soldiers since ""Hogan's Heroes""...This film is NOT to be taken seriously (in case you weren't sure), but to be enjoyed as one of the wildest, zaniest, most exciting adventure films of WWII. Director Raoul Walsh pulled out all the stops...and listen for Flynn's final line...""Now for Australia, and a crack at those Japs!"", which had audiences in stitches, even in 1942! (4 1/2 stars, out of 5)

""Edge of Darkness"" (1943): If ""Desperate Journey"" was unabashed silliness, ""Edge"" was a strong, brooding ensemble drama, filmed with director Lewis Milestone's compassion and understanding. Framed with a ""Beau Geste""-style opening (in a ruined, deserted Norwegian village), the tale is told in flashback, as the Germans hold the village under an iron thumb. Some villagers profit by the Nazi presence, some plot their destruction, but Milestone makes it clear...to be neutral is no safe haven; either you fight, or you are no better than the profiteers. The cast is simply superb, especially Walter Huston, as the pacifist village doctor, Ruth Gordon as his oblivious wife, and Judith Anderson, as a woman fighting an attraction to a sympathetic German soldier. Flynn gives a restrained, self-assured performance as the resistance leader...sadly, Flynn's rape trial occurred during filming, overshadowing a profoundly moving film...(5 stars, out of 5)

""Northern Pursuit"" (1943): Flynn's first post-trial film, this slow-moving adventure of Canadian Mountie Flynn infiltrating the spy ring supporting Nazi Helmut Dantine's deadly plans, lacks a spark of real enthusiasm from either Flynn or director Raoul Walsh. There are a few forced bits of 'humor' referring to the trial, and Flynn's character is already incorporating elements of the 'roue' that would redefine his screen persona, but as a whole, the film is indecisive as either action or drama, and a disappointment...(2 stars, out of 5)

""Uncertain Glory"" (1944): The most bizarre, least successful of Flynn's war films, Career criminal Flynn (here playing 'Jean Picard') is sentenced to the guillotine, but an explosion allows him to escape...only to be recaptured by wise Inspector Paul Lukas. While returning Flynn to be beheaded, the pair learn of an act of sabotage (a destroyed bridge) that has so infuriated the Nazis that they announce they will execute 100 innocent French citizens, unless the saboteur steps forward. Flynn offers to accept the blame, preferring a firing squad to a guillotine, but the question is, will he turn himself in, or try to escape, especially as he falls in love...This reworking of ""A Tale of Two Cities"" (with a touch of ""Les Miserables"" tossed in) simply doesn't work, at all...Flynn's usual charm seems forced, the drama slides into melodrama, and by film's end, I really didn't care WHAT Flynn would do...(1 1/2 stars, out of 5).

""Objective, Burma!"" (1945): A tremendous rebound, after ""Uncertain Glory"", this taut, exciting action/drama of a successful mission in occupied Burma going terribly wrong, should have been a worldwide hit, offering incredible battle sequences, and some of Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn's best dramatic work together...but politics sank the film. The British government felt the American filmmakers snubbed their position as the major 'player' in the Burma campaign, implying the Americans ""did it all"", by themselves. This wasn't true (or even implied), and Warner's quickly added a preface to the movie, acknowledging British leadership and involvement...but the damage was done, and foreign distributers quickly yanked the film, as crowds booed Flynn and his squad off the screen. A great film never had a chance...Watch it, today, and you'll appreciate the film for the masterful work it actually was...(5 stars, out of 5).

What a collection...Enjoy!",1280880000,43,4830,5.357048748353096

All of these films have a World War II theme and all five are very good with the exception of ""Northern Pursuit"" which is ridiculous and - worse for a Flynn film - painfully slow. There have been some disagreements on what I've seen for extra features on Objective Burma. Some show the commentary as present, some do not. Overall, I'd recommend this set as a buy, especially if you don't already own Objective Burma in some form.",1273276800,58,2660,5.12933025404157
1524809,3,B00005JO4D,"The heroic resistance of the occupied Norway attracted, for some reason, a fair amount of interest, in ""The Commandos Strike At Dawn,""

""The Moon Is Down,"" and ""Edge of Darkness.""

Lewis Milestone, who has made the pacifist ""All Quiet on the Western Front, is a key figure in crusading films about war..

His ""Edge of Darkness"" is a brave and interesting film ,and a touching tribute to Norwegian courage during the Nazi occupation...

The characterization is cleverly drawn: Errol Flynn, the fisherman who assumes command of the resistance in his small Norwegian village; Ann Sheridan, the willful and obstinate daughter of the respected physician Walter Huston who didn't want to know but is led inexorably to aid the resistance after his innocent daughter is brutally raped by a German soldier; Ruth Gordon, his shy retiring wife, as the neurotic mother who lives in dreams of the past; her greedy brother, the opportunistic businessman Charles Dingle who owns the cannery which employs most of the villagers, a traitor who ""deals in facts... The future is with the New Order.""

After the battle between the German garrison and the townspeople, when all his hopes and dreams are shattered, he wanders through the devastated village claiming it as his own: ""It's mine, it's all mine"", he cries with mad irrational eyes to a German patrol... Of course he is shot down...

Another characters in the movie: John Beal, the weak and traitorous son; an innkeeper (Judith Anderson) whose hatred of the enemy is intensified by their killing of her husband; and a courageous schoolmaster (Morris Carvosky), whose ivory tower is completely smashed...

The most interesting feature of the film is in its declination of social structure... The capitalist Dingle, is recognized by the brutal Nazis; the humble fisherman Flynn becomes the leader of the underground movement...

All the peacetime hierarchies are overturned: the lovely Ann Sheridan is capable to fall in love with Flynn, who, in peacetime, would have been untouchable..

Decision-making is no longer the exclusive right of the town elders, but of everybody... All the villagers must be involved... In the church they gather to decide whether or not to accept British guns and bullets... It is a matter for the villagers to decide by concord of opinion... They talk until they have agreed..

The film ends with the marching into the hills to continue their resistance... Walter Huston stumbles and falls... Flynn and his fiance rush to help him up... He protests, ""I can manage alone!"" They persist, and as they hold him between them, Flynn says, ""There is no need to walk alone.""",1167177600,32,2633,5.046082949308755
1524810,5,B00005JO4D,"Impressive, absorbing and fundamental film during the Nazi take over in Norway. Lewis Milestone was a great director but when he decided to make a war movie something happened. He was provided by a special spell touch. It's happens the same when John Ford made a Western or Hitchcock a suspense picture. He was possessed by an inner call . There is a Spanish term previously used by Federico Garca Lorca when he meant that special phenomena. He talked about ""to have hobgoblin"". And precisely this is the appropriate term designed to L.M.

An efficient cast completes the whole work.",1116201600,31,583,4.83

1525054,5,B00005JO4D,A really nice collection of Flynn films. I especially like Desperate Journey. These movies really show Flynn off as a real fine actor. Less swashbuckling here and Flynn is called upon to really give some dramatic weight and he definitely brings it off winningly. I would highly recommend this collection and it's a great price as well.,1470700800,,335,4.894736842105263
1525055,5,B00005JO4D,I love Errol Flynn war movies! Each of the 5 movies was excellent. Great gift of any old war movie buffs!,1469145600,,105,4.0476190476190474
1525056,4,B00005JO4D,"I bought this set along with the TCM Errol Flynn 'Swashbuckler' set.  While that shows off Flynn's great on screen presence as swashbuckler, or
witty archer of Sherwood Forest,  this set is his WW2 efforts.  ""Desperate Journey"", ""Edge of Darkness"", ""Northern Pursuit"", ""Uncertain Glory"",
and ""Objective, Burma"".  Yes, these were mainly propaganda movies that the era needed to keep the morale up.
Now in hindsight we can see how ridiculous some of these seem.  The chase across Canada in Northern Pursuit is pure dumbness.  The heroic Norwegians of ""Edge of Darkness"" are cliche stereotyped.  Desperate Journey, downed American flyers escaping across Germany, is problematic.  But it has Raymond Massey in his most evil role and Alan Hale in a rare non-sidekick type role.
Objective Burma is a good action film and well researched (for a Warner's Brothers film that says a lot).
My favorite here is Uncertain Glory.  A war picture only in that it is set in German Occupied France.  Flynn plays a French thief, who escapes the Guillotine, during an air raid.  He is pursued across France by French Inspector Paul Lukas, who gives one of his finest performances here.  The two play off each other extremely well, and you feel bad for the Lukas character each time the Flynn character cons him, and you are still not sure of Flynn right up to the last scene.  This was worth the set price.",1468972800,,1386,4.846808510638298

1525268,5,B00005JO4D,"I have been searching for the movie: Desperate Journey with Flynn and Ronald Regan, for some time. I noted a while back, that a seller on Amazon was asking $100.00 for one VHS copy! I looked on various other sights, under Ronald Regan movies, and could only find it in collectors packages- all of which were out of my price range. I then looked up Flynn, and found it in this collection  for under $25.00. I was really excited as Desperate Journey is one of my favorite Ronal Regan movies. This set of DVDs also includes other Flynn movies which I am looking forward to viewing for the first time. Even if I am not as fond of the other shows featured on this set, having the Regan movie makes it well-worth the money I spent.",1439769600,,725,4.330882352941177

1525439,5,B00005JO4D,"This boxed set is a must have for all Errol Flynn fans and all fans of World War Two movies. Not only were these movie highly entertaining now and then but they were huge patriotic and moral boosting at a time when the war was not going very well for America. Interestingly, Flynn was suspected of being a Nazi spy but it never was proven.

Flynn westerns were also huge at the box office. One of his best was,""Rocky Mountain"" a 1950 movie in black and white that tells a little known story about the Civil War. I suspect that the movie was shot in black and white because the ravages of alcohol were starting to show on Flynn. Truth be told, Flynn drank himself out of his career and most of his movies from the fifties were an embarrassing slow slide to his death in 1959. ""Rocky Mountain"" was his career capper",1422662400,,813,4.313725490196078

His role is understated and, while heroic, not the usual swashbuckling daring-do Flynn is recognized for.  It starts dark and gets darker as it goes along.  The amazing thing is that this type of thing did go on during WWII.  I don't know why this film is not better known and recognized as one of Flynn's finest performances. It was made in 1943, when nobody really knew how the war was going to play out.  It has a strong patriotic/anti-Nazi theme (which is understandable, considering the times).  This is not an ""Errol Flynn Movie""... it's a very good movie that Errol Flynn happens to be in.",1383868800,,696,4.564516129032258

1525723,4,B00005JO4D,"Book-ended by Desperate Journey and Objective:Burma, these five Errol Flynn war movies are actually pretty good.  Granted, they're dated with ""set"" backgrounds quite obvious in some of them--still they're surprisingly entertaining.  The two best are Desperate Journey, a story of fliers with Ronald Reagan and Arthur kennedy along for the ride and Objective:Burma a very good tale of soldiers trapped behind enemy lines after a successful mission (I knew it was going too smoothly!)  Edge of Darkness moved a little slowly but the storyline of Norwegians finally standing up to the Nazis does keep your attention.  Northern Pursuit seemed far-fetched to me but still enjoyable.  And Uncertain Glory has Flynn playing quite a different role as a man condemned to die on the guillotine until fate steps in and throws him (and the policeman out to get him) a big curve.

If you like Errol Flynn I think you'll enjoy this set.",1369785600,,922,5.032894736842105

Because I'm a fan of Errol Flynn and because I had enjoyed the 3 films I had seen, I wanted to buy this box set of his World War 2 films. I always find it truly amazing how Warner Brothers managed to fit Flynn in to so many different nationalities! Within these 5 films he's: 2 Americans, a Norwegian, a Canadian and a Frenchman.  Somehow, I don't think Warners ever cast him as an Australian (or a Tasmanian, which he truly was). Yes, I know of the flack the he and Warners encountered over ""Objective, Burma!""; I know that the film makes it look like the Americans were a big presence in Burma, when in reality it was more of the other Allied Troops that were involved. Regardless, it is a good action picture.  Buy this for the Flynn films because most of the extras (except the cartoons) are a little cheesy by today's standards.",1296950400,7,957,4.252747252747253

Remember watching Errol Flynn Theater on Sunday afternoons when I was a youngster. Desperate Journey, Edge of Darkness and Northern Pursuit are still as great as I remembered. I already owned Objective Burma and have to say it is one of my favorite WWII movies of all time. No idea why it hasn't been better received,it is on my top 10 list. I had never seen Uncertain Glory before and was looking foreward to it. Too be honest I probably won't be watching it again in the near future.

1525825,4,B00005JO4D,"Out of a total of more than 50 feature films, Errol Flynn made only five that had a World War 11 background and this well-presented box set gathers them all together making an interesting collection.

The set kicks off with ""Desperate Journey"" (1942), a rousing if somewhat improbable yarn of an British bomber crew who are shot down while on a mission and make their way back to England via Nazi-occupied Holland.  Directed at a frantic pace by Raoul Walsh, it is played mainly for laughs by Flynn, Ronald Reagan, Alan Hale and Arthur Kennedy as the principal crew members pitting their wits against the ruthless Germans who are portrayed as ignorant buffoons. In its few moments of sadness and tragedy, director Walsh does not linger any longer than necessary and wastes no time in picking up the action as the film moves to a ridiculous climax where our heroes steal a plane and vitually decimate every German soldier in sight before taking off and dropping a large bomb on an important munitions factory on their way back to England. Flynn has the last line ""Now for Australia and a crack at those Japs.""  The pace of this film is so fast that it doesn't even allow for any suspension of disbelief. But if you don't take it seriously, it's enjoyable.

The second film ""Edge Of Darkness"" is a much more polished production dealing with the inhabitants of a Nazi-occupied Norwegian fishing village. Directed with a firm hand by Lewis Milestone, it's an engrossing story covering the feelings and attitudes of different characters and their various reactions to the Germans who make their lives difficult. Errol Flynn and Ann Sheridan are the stars but their characters form only part of the action and they share screen time with a most distinguished cast including Walter Huston, Ruth Gordon and Judith Anderson.
Over the course of its two hours running time the film builds up a convincing sense of tension that results in a terrific action climax.  Franx Waxman's score may be a little too bombastic in places but the film, as a whole, is immensely satisfying.

I can't agree with those viewers who feel that ""Northern Pursuit""(1943) is an inferior film that lacks action and suspense. I enjoyed it enormously. It may not be a masterpiece but, for the most part, it has excellent pacing a good story that starts well and hits most of its intended targets. Flynn is in good form as a Canadian Mountie of German parentage who undertakes a mission to confound a group of ruthless Nazi saboteurs led by Warner's ""Nazi-in-residence"" Helmut Dantine.

The next film ""Uncertain Glory"" not only lacks action and suspense, it lacks an intelligent. As a devious French career criminal who eventually sacrifices himself as a converted patriot, Flynn is sadly miscast and gives what can only be described as an uncertain performance under Raoul Walsh's equally uncertain direction.  The film deservedly was a flop in 1944 and doesn't really deserve a DVD release except as part of Errol Flynn's World War 11 canon.

""Objective,Burma"" (1945), the last film in this collection is an outstanding war film by any standards. It concerns a mission by a small group of paratroopers entering into the steamy Burmese jungle to destroy a Japanese radar station in preparation for an Allied invasion.  Unlike many war films, this has an air of authenticity in the way the mission is mounted and executed. Flynn is excellent as the leader of the mission. There is no sense of phony bravura or over-the-top heroics in his performance and he comes across as human and,at times, believably vulnerable. The action sequences are well handled as is the sense of desperation that develops when the platoon realises that they are outnumbered and beyond rescue.

This time, Franz Waxman delivers a superb score that perfectly supports the film's 142 minutes running time.

The set, as a whole, is worth a place in any interesting collection - four out of five isn't a bad average - and Warners have done their usual fine job of presenting each film in good condition with a whole plethora of ""extras."" Highly recommended.

Footnote
This is Warner's fourth box set of Errol Flynn - which means that they have now released most of his best work.  Not all of Flynn's films were good but I believe there is sufficient scope for one more box set that could feature ""Never Say Goodbye""(1946),""Cry Wolf"" (1947), ""Silver River""(1948, ""That Forsyte Woman"" (1949) and ""Kim""(1951)",1284595200,5,4440,4.8791500664010625

7940656,5,B00005JO4D,"I liked each one of these movies. I actually loved Desperate Journey. One reviewer made it sound as if this film is slapstick. Far from it! It's a great ""surviving behind enemy lines"" adventure drama film. Edge of Darkness is extraordinary in its depiction of the heroism of the resistance in Norway with an unforgettable ending. Incredible! In Uncertain Glory, Flynn's character goes through a moral transformation in the course of the story and that is always satisfying to see in a film. Objective, Burma is great. I even liked the much maligned Northern Pursuit. It creates a certain atmosphere with its remote and mysterious Canadian winter wilderness locations. I'll watch it again. At around 6 bucks per Errol Flynn film, you simply can't go wrong. And it's so nice to be able to watch WWII movies without hearing the F word and GD constantly as in today's war movies. (Except for Hacksaw Ridge which was refreshingly devoid of cursing.) Pick up this awesome collection of WWII films. You won't be sorry!",1512345600,,1011,4.883720930232558
