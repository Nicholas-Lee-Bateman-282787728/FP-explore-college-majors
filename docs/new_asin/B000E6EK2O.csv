2499338,2,B000E6EK2O,"I like him in Black Sheep, Tommy Boy, and Rules of Engagement which is the reason why I wanted to watch this stand up.  This is the first one I've seen of his and it just didn't do it for me.  I have only sat through 1/3 of the show and I don't know if i want to watch the rest to provide a better review.  If I do, then I'll update the review.  From what I've seen, his humor is similar to Rules of Engagement and it worked well for me in the TV series.  As a stand up, not so much.",1400889600,,483,3.650485436893204
2499339,4,B000E6EK2O,"I bought this DVD because this special of David Spade's was one of many that I used to watch a lot in high school (along with Dana Carvey, Bill Maher, & Paul Rodriguez). And it's just as funny as I remembered. He jokes about school, concerts, zoos, hotels, parents, dating, movies etc. Although I'm not in tears from the laughter as I am when I watch Ellen Degeneres or Eddie Izzard, but I might've been when I first watched this comedy hour decades ago.",1369612800,,454,4.416666666666667
2499340,5,B000E6EK2O,"NOTHING. The part about Brad Pitt going to his school is beyond hilarious, and the way he phrases the bit about not knowing Queen or Wham! were gay -- laugh-cramp-inducing, to say the least. I, too, had it on VHS and was afraid to play it one more time in case it melted. Even after meeting him in person and not being at all impressed with his arrogance, I absolutely love his humor and especially his delivery--and that's saying a lot for an unforgiving Italian like me! LOL",1267401600,5,476,4.420454545454546
2499341,5,B000E6EK2O,"Very, very funny, witty and full of the great sarcasm we have grown to know and love from David Spade",1167782400,2,101,4.1
2499342,5,B000E6EK2O,"I don't care if you dislike Spade's movies or his television shows, this concert is incredibly well written and performed. Great delivery and self-depricating humor. I have listened to this show about a hundred times and it is still fresh and great observational humor. Buy this, you will laugh, a lot.",1160438400,6,302,4.9411764705882355
2499343,5,B000E6EK2O,Awesome. Like most of the other reviewers I downloaded the audio version of this gig from the 'net and have given it a major flogging over the years. I too had a grainy VHS copy taped off television that I used to introduce friends and family to this perfect stand-up routine. Eternally quotable and infinitely watchable. Thankyou HBO for finally relenting to the constant pleas from us all and releasing this on DVD!,1156550400,4,417,4.726027397260274
2499344,4,B000E6EK2O,"I, like the other reviewers, have become well acquainted with this material after repeated watching (and listening).  While I dig this stand-up (it spent a long time on my Top 5 All-time favorite stand-ups), it is the same material Spade used for years.  He still uses a lot of this material in his live stand-up today and he had this material from his start.  It is still a great special, effectively his career ""best of"".",1153267200,4,423,4.613333333333333
2499345,5,B000E6EK2O,"I currently have this DVD on order and I am VERY excited about it being shipped. As a previous reviewer has indicated, I also wrote HBO in hopes of getting this produced (maybe it worked!). I too downloaded this a long time ago and that CD has seen some serious play (thanks Napster!). I have only seen the stand-up once on HBO, the day it aired for the first time, so I always have to explain the Everclear bit when he explains how much will get a girl wasted and how much will kill her. There is not a part in this stand-up which is unfunny, I might have to buy two copies cause I know I'll wear one out. David Spade, you have cursed me because everytime I'm on a flight now I have to make the ""boing"" sound of the call button and laugh and everyone around me thinks I'm crazy. Pulled the ol dipsy doodle on that one.",1146787200,5,819,4.093167701863354
2499346,5,B000E6EK2O,"""Take the Hit"" is quite possibly the best stand-up comedy I have ever seen. I love Dane Cook and Chris Rock, but David Spade's ""Take the Hit"" is the best 60 minutes of comedy money can buy.

  I'm afraid that the title of this review contains more truth than I would like to admit. About 7 years ago, I saw pieces of Spade's HBO special on an improv comedy TV show (the original routine was heavily edited), and I've been obsessed ever since. I don't know if I ever laughed so hard sitting alone in my living room. I downloaded the audio from the internet, and I've listened to it countless times. I listened to the audio with my friends (who also found it hilarious...of course), and our conversations became infused with David Spade quotations and allusions. There was only one problem: I could NEVER find any type of video copy of the stand-up routine anywhere. Problem solved.",1145750400,11,880,4.556962025316456
2499347,5,B000E6EK2O,"I recorded David Spade's 1998 HBO Special Take the Hit and VHS and nearly wore the tape down rewatching it over and over ith my friends. We wrote HBO petitioning them to release this on DVD, because our copy got so grainy and I recorded over his introduction with a little amateur home video. But believe me when I say, this is the funniest thing I've ever seen. I can recite it by heart. Spade's sarcastic delivery is perfect and the guy is excessively quotable. Highlights include the bits about Brad Pitt going to his school for one year, Spade's kickball skills, and why he likes the zoo so much. Buy this DVD! It will not disappoint. And David, if you're reading this, I need a job. Hook it up, bro.",1142899200,17,704,4.3816793893129775

2499379,2,B000E6EK2O,"At the time it was probably hilarious, rare case for SNL alum, hence his mega star status. This particular set just doesnt have enough edge to be relevant today, common of SNL alum. I haven't seen anything recent of his, which says a lot in itself, but im assuming since he has teamed up with sandler, just another SNL alum who will go out with a pathetic whimper, that he has done whatever he is going to do as a comedian. Nothing left but to phone in some tired jokes for paychecks, while we are stuck watching stuff like this saying ""i remember when i thought he was funny.""",1472083200,,577,4.302752293577981
2499380,5,B000E6EK2O,"I've seen this 3 times.  The first time shortly after it originally came out and have caught it on cable or On Demand a couple of times since.  I could watch this over and over and laugh at the same jokes every time.  He is a genuinely funny guy.  I think part of the appeal of his stand up is not only that he is really funny, but also his demeanor and the way he delivers his jokes.  He's very laid back, it seems so natural for him...and he's also fond of goofy little sound effects...it works.",1471564800,,497,4.082474226804123

For me, Spade's best comedy was his starring role in TV sitcom ""Rules of Engagement"" with Patrick Warburton (Puddy in ""Seinfeld"") and Oliver Hudson (Goldie Hawn's son).  Thanks to a great ensemble cast, Rules of Engagement is hilarious (2007-2013) and stands the test of time.  Spade's years on SNL and some of his films - very funny.  But this 1998 standup special in his hometown, Phoenix - not so much.  And, it's too bad, because I was really looking forward to a good laugh.",1495411200,,485,4.658823529411765

I got excited because I am a big fan of David Spade as an actor all his movies and shows he cracks me up so I had high expectations for this I thought id be laughing like crazy but no I only smirked once or twice so to me he either he had a bad performance that night or he isn't a good stand up comedian, I now know that you can be a funny actor and not a good stand up comedian, it is possible because now I watched this. It seemed like his jokes weren't clever and the stories were way to far fetched. I know stand up comedians sometimes exaggerate a litte to make a joke or observation funnier but his were way over exaggerated to the point of it being unrealistic. I only watched like 15 minutes and shut it off and before I was eager to watch it so ya not extremely disappointed! Sorry David Spade still love your movies though!",1481155200,,860,4.094674556213017
