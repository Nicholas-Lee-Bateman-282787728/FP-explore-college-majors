8333770,1,B001PMR2UI,"This book was awful.  I compare it to the grimoire to try to make sense of it and its more confusing.  Maybe its me that's dumb but I've been playing for over a decade and know quite a bit about chord theory and scales- so this should just fall in line right?  Nope.  Oh, I have a B.A. degree and an A.A.S degree so I know how to read.  Its endless memorization of note patterns without any good explanation of why.  And in the dvd everything sounds the same.  Okay maybe its me but after 'modes demystified' this guy remains mystified.",1354665600,2,536,4.247524752475248
8333771,5,B001PMR2UI,This program guides you through major scale theory then on to the Modes in an easy to understand fashion. The e tablature book helps you to follow along with tons of additional content. The suppot web site is amazing too! I am a guitar teacher and I use this program with my students and it has really helped them to understand and most importantly apply the modes. Get this program now if you want to learn the modes!,1321747200,3,418,4.371794871794871
8333772,1,B001PMR2UI,"I found this way to complicated and hard to understand.  In addition, there's dozens of scales to memorize and is (in my opinion) very tedious work.  After going through the entire CD several times, I still had no idea what modes were. Until I found Desi Serna, his CD made it so easy to understand and use it makes me feel silly it took me so long to get it.  Check out Desi Serna, he is very easy to understand on all his CD's.  Finally, I get it!",1314316800,4,449,4.068181818181818
