__________________________________________
12TH Season Notes: This season should have
been released at first as McGarrett and w/
the warning: break glass only if emergency.
In other words only the bravest of Five-0
fans can adequately judge this hodge-podge-
lodge of episodes. First the filming and
releaseing was jumbled. Sharon Ferrell
left the show after filming 9 episodes,
so why does 'The Moroville Covenant' get
shown last in syndication a lot of times?
Danny Kamekona returns - out of the blue(!!)
as Nick in one episode (though Mary-Angela
screws up his name and almost flubs her lines,
calling him 'Dick' instead of 'Nick' and in
the credits he's listed as 'Tom Kellog'. Huh?
Was the hawai'ian looking Nick's last name
Kellog? If not who is T.K.? Is this another
inside joke? He also appears as 'Lt.', in a
suit in T.M.C....Strange. The only episode
that the five main members of the staff appear
in is: G.H.I.H.T.F*. Herman Wedemeyer had heart
problems early in the filming and missed six or
seven episodes. Rumour is that William (Carew)
Smith was originally set to do only A Lion In
The Streets and Good Help Is Hard To Find. I
have no problem with him in those two. Only
Duke and Truck get treated fairly in this 12th
season episodes by McGarrett, who orders Lori
around and uses Carew as a human sheild and a
strong-back to break in doors most of the 12th
season. Danno's having left is mentioned once
in *G.H.I.H.T.F by t.v. critic 'Mark Maynard'
[late sports caster, Les 'The General' Keiter]
who says: ""Good men have left in disgust..."" Tony
Alika is of course in both A Lion In The Streets
and Good Help Is Hard To Find and that wraps up
some loose ends. Sign of the Ram is the continu-
ation of Horoscope For Murder [and also Let Death
Do Us Part]. Clash of Shadows is the wretched fol-
low up to A Distant Thunder, which was wretched
enough (Neo-Nutzies in Hawai'i? Come on...). The
episodes without Duke - or the Governor are the
worst of the lot, but there are some bright spots
here and there...The Flight of the Jewels, A Shal-
low Grave, Voice of Terror, A Lion in The Streets
and The Golden Noose are worth a good look. Use A
Gun, Go to Hell has plenty of Duke in it, but it
an updated rehash of 'Diary of a Gun', which is
pretty bad itself.  A very-Anti-second Amendment
episode. There are a lot of repeating scenarios
in the 10th, 11th and 12th seasons. Even Doug
Mossman shows up in uniform - as Police Chief of
the fictional Lono Bay, in the last season

How the 12th Season could have been better - Even
withut Danno! Bring Frank Kamana back, put Nick
in a suit, of course move Duke up to number two.
Forget Lori (and the unfortunate Kevin) Wilson!
And the addition of Truck would have given McG
a whole gaggle of hawai'ian talent. The Lineup
should have been: McGarrett, Duke, Truck, Nick
and Frank - or how about Sandi Welles?! Amanda
McBroom is way better than Sahron Ferrell! So
Long, Five-0. It shouldn't have had to end like
this!",1239148800,14,4115,4.585597826086956
3653136,5,B001JAHQGG,"All disks played well.  No rattling cases.  The worst season of H-50, but still better than the ""New, Improved!!!"" H-50, of course.  Actually, it is much better than I remembered.",1494460800,,179,4.9
3653137,5,B001JAHQGG,"Just great season. But im only on 2nd episode. Here, when MacGerrett recruit Carew he almost pronounce Danno! But almost...
The 2nd episode was powerful with a lady whois husband died, also becoming part of the force.
I will miss Danno and Ho Kelly but still, Steve or Jack plays well until the last powerful episode. It's just to finish well the season that marks  the series as a whole, and without it it won't do.

Worth to buy! I give it 4 plus stars",1494288000,2,454,4.329411764705882

3653140,5,B001JAHQGG,"""Hawaii Five-O"" is one of the most entertaining and iconic detective shows in the history of television. This twelfth and final season continues to follow the exploits of Detective Captain Steve McGarrett, who serves as the head of the Hawaiian State Police Special Task Force known as Hawaii Five-O. Jack Lord delivers a perennially outstanding performance portraying the unflappable and intrepid Captain Steve McGarrett, in his mission to vanquish the criminal element in Hawaii. Although ""Hawaii Five-O"" now comes across as being somewhat comical, because its initial episodes are almost fifty-years-old, most viewers still find it to be enjoyable, especially because of the spectacular Hawaiian scenery. Therefore, I give ""Hawaii Five-O"" a five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1485561600,2,799,5.722689075630252

3653143,5,B001JAHQGG,"Absolute Classic!  A top notch quality programme the like of which they don't make anymore . Interesting stories that were not only entertaining & riveting but fascinated the viewer with many cultural and historical facets.  Jack Lord is sheer perfection as Steve McGarrett, one of the best characters ever created.  The scenery is stunning & the entire cast ensemble is a pleasure to watch in action.
Long live the ORIGINAL - in fact the one & only Hawaii Five -0 - from 1968 to 1980.

The 'modern day' remake of this universally loved television show is an absolute joke.  Nothing more than a carbon copy of the mundane CSI & NCIS shows & spin offs where every episode follows the exact same format & only the names change.  So don't waste precious time that you will never get back by watching todays equivalent to ""intellectual Fodder"", instead grab yourself the delightful, action packed ORIGINAL and watch  twelve glorious seasons of brilliant drama.",1481500800,,956,4.864197530864198

3653239,3,B001JAHQGG,"This season William Smith best known for his role as Falconetti in Rich Man, Poor Man takes over for James McArthur in Hawaii 5-0. Not the best season of the entire series but still very entertaining. The last episode of the series ends with Wo-Fat, the very first episode also features him as the bad guy. The only thing I can't understand is in the bonus features the hip-hop video. It makes no sense because that music doesn't fit in the era that the series were broadcasted and besides most of the people who would purchase this series are old timers like me.",1460851200,,563,4.475728155339806

3653242,5,B001JAHQGG,Enjoy It Thanks William,1459036800,,23,5.0
3653243,5,B001JAHQGG,We have watched all the previous original Hawaii Five O series and this is no less enjoyable.  While it is disappointing Danny is missing from the cast the new members are assimilated very well within the storyline and bring their own respective strengths.  The stories are good and reflect the attitudes and behaviours of the late 1970's.  For Five O fans this series is well worth viewing and rounds out what will be remembered as a well made and most entertaining series.,1458864000,3,474,4.7560975609756095
3653244,1,B001JAHQGG,Season 12 breaks the heart of die-hard fans.  It hardly seems like the same show without Danno to balance Steve out.  Two new characters  who severely change the dynamics feel like intruders.,1458777600,,191,4.90625

3653270,5,B001JAHQGG,"Dann-O may have left 5-0 for this final season, but I'm still digging it! It doesn't take too long to get used to the new characters, and one is a woman cop who joined after her husband was killed hours before he was supposed to start as a 5-0 agent. Steve gave her the job instead. The other character is a former Boston cop that helped McGarret solve a case in the first episode.",1453075200,,381,4.162162162162162
3653271,5,B001JAHQGG,Great experience.  Thank you.,1451952000,,29,6.25
3653272,5,B001JAHQGG,"In the final season of one of the greatest shows ever, McGarrett's got a new posse. Things are different but the show is still mighty good.  The main thing is that McGarret is still at the helm. And yeah, McGarrett still has those big sideburns! He has a new right hand man, Kimo, played by William Smith. You don't mess with Falconetti! William Smith is a bad dude and a world record weightlifter. He fits right in to the Five-0 mold. The ever steady Duke Lukela is still in McGarret's Posse. There's now a lady on the team and she is horrendous. They keep her duties to a minimum.  They should have killed her off in the first episode.
Overall, though, the show is still great and the final episode with McGarrett slugging it out with Wo Fat is the best series ending since Dr. Richard Kimball took down the one-armed man!  So order this DVD and say your goodbye's to Steve McGarrett.  If you don't buy this show, you are a bigger loser than Wo Fat.",1449532800,4,951,4.3559322033898304

3653276,2,B001JAHQGG,"The Original, the last two years, 11 and 12, were not as good as the first ten. It fell apart and was easy to see why Jack Lord made the decision not to continue after year 12. The new age Bull S. of women replacing men as macho and taking over the leading roles was not accepted back then as it is today. Women belong at home in the kitchen and raising the kids. That is why this Nation is going to Hxll in a hand basket. The only reason I bought this season was to have the complete set.",1447632000,,489,3.9
3653277,3,B001JAHQGG,"This is the final in the series of a long running and great TV show.  The eleventh and twelfth season episodes clearly lack the polish and good story lines of all the other episodes.  James MacArthur who played Danno in the series preceding the eleventh and twelfth seasons is sorely missed.  As good as the new characters are such as William Smith (always a pleasure to watch) it just isn't the same, along with weaker and almost ridiculous story lines.  It is the opinion of this viewer that perhaps Jack Lord was not the easiest individual to work with.  His character overall tended to be rather absent of nuance and depth.  Without Danno and all the other wonderful personalities around him, he rather fades into background.  The very final episode has Lord as the sole ""hero"" finally ensnaring his nemesis Wo Fat.  The episode quite fell flat (pardon the poor rhyme).  Seasons 1 through ten are stellar.",1446681600,5,909,4.738853503184713

However, this set is to me a great big disappointment. the end of the series is going out with a bang! whilst some episodes were watchable the rest were distant. nothing like the early ones  that you wanted to see again. forget Danno!, Chin & Kono they have been replaced by new actors who are no where near to the original actors when the series began on T.V. the stories and plots are weary and just have nothing to offer. even Steve Mc Garratt seems to dress causal and only wears a suit now and again. it's a shame as if the original actors completed this series it would be a fitting tribute to a great end to an American Police Drama.",1400284800,,901,4.238372093023256

3653387,3,B001JAHQGG,"I think that the writers and producers really BLEW a GREAT opportunity with Five-O's final episode. With the ongoing rivalry and hatred building between these two men (McGarrett & Wo Fat) since the first episode 12 years before, it would have made perfect sense if the final episode had been more like this:

  *****

The storyline SHOULD have revealed that Wo Fat had systematically eliminated ALL of McGarrett's ORIGINAL squad, Danno, Kono, and Chin...and McGarrett found out:

Duke is in the hospital, critically wounded by an unknown sniper, and expires. His last words to Mc Garrett, who is in the hospital room : ""Wo Fat"".

Wo Fat, after killing all of his men, then goes after McGarrett, saving HIM for LAST. But Steve goes from being the prey...to the predator.

 THAT would have made for GREAT television , and would have given Steve even MORE reason and incentive  to pursue and finally throw Wo Fat in the slammer. There had NEVER been any reasons written in the script about the departures of those cast members when they left the series: Kono after Season 4, Chin Ho after Season 10 (other than the fact that he was murdered while undercover...but WHY ?) , and Danny after Season 11. No explanation AT ALL...and that would have been a perfect way to justify McGarrett being spurred to the GREATEST anger ...with an obsession to eliminate Wo Fat ONCE AND FOR ALL !!!

That would have brought the 12 years of Hawall Five-O to an SPECTACULAR CLIMAX !!

Postscript: Mc Garrett finally puts Wo Fat away.

 Wo Fat uses a file to escape from prison. overpowers a guard, grabs a gun ...and heads out the prison door, only to see a big black Mercury Park Lane (not the later Marquis, the ORIGINAL car) facing him unmanned. Wo Fat looks around in terror, totally freaked out. he looks around, and sees no one. Then a voice calls out from the darkness. Wo Fat turns, and upon seeing Mc Garrett,attempts to aim his gun.

 Mc Garrett is faster.

 CHANGE OF SCENE: The Governor's office. Mc Garrett walks in, without a word , drops his badge on the Governor's desk, and walks away.

(ending credits).

A far more dramatic, and suitable conclusion for this long running series. McGarrett and Wo Fat had been on a collision course since the very first episode. This would have been the PERFECT bookend to the rivalry that started in the pilot episode 12 years before.

THAT is how the series SHOULD have ended...",1377734400,2,2409,4.6635071090047395

3653441,4,B001JAHQGG,"It does have it's good qualities. The scenery is stunning. You're watching the original paradise that was Hawaii, long before it became over commercialized. The remastering was quite good. Color and detail is very nice. Some of the episodes are better than others but overall the final season is not as good as the earlier ones in terms of story quality.

You'd never know it from his performances here but William Smith, who plays Kimo, was in real life an immensely talented man. He has a master's degree from UCLA (graduated cum laude). He speaks five languages fluently. He was a champion bodybuilder and was inducted into the bodybuilding hall of fame. He was a two time world wrist wrestling champion. He wrote poetry. He held black belts in Kenpo Karate and Kung Fu. At one time he was a CIA operative. It's true...look it up.

Jack Lord gets a bit preachy and self indulgent...kind of like Alan Alda in the final year or two of M*A*S*H...in a few episodes. Lord seems to dominate every moment of every scene, to the detriment of some of the other characters on the show. Their talents are wasted as a bunch of McGarrett yes men. The supporting cast does a decent job but it's not the same without Dan-O.

There is plenty of unintended comic relief. Lord's hair is firmly cemented in place, as always, with the trademark three locks of hair shading the right quadrant of his forehead. The overgrown sideburns are even more pronounced in year twelve than in past years. Some of the ties he wears are just outright ghastly, even for the 70's. In a couple of episodes he is sporting leisure suits that are guaranteed to induce gut clutching, eye tearing, roll on the floor laughter.

Overall, if you're a Five-O collector, then I'd say pick it up. For the casual fan you're probably better off getting years 1-4.",1355356800,,1816,4.64797507788162

SEASON 12 is said by others to be bad but it isn't. Season 12 shows that Jack Lord WAS INDEED THE SHOW, him and Hawaii were the overall stars and season 12 introduces new people and some of it's episodes are really interesting.
Remember, this show was from 1968-1980, I was 8 months old when the first episide aired, it introduced the world to the State of Hawaii which had only been a state at the time Five O started, for 9 years. SEASON 12 is the end of a great show and although it might not be the BEST season of Five O, it was still pretty good to the hardcore Five O fans.",1345593600,,668,4.068181818181818
3653446,1,B001JAHQGG,"First the positives; this set is presented nicely with a decent standard of remastering throughout. That aside, the show itself is, by this stage, pretty poor. In fact, it's unrecognisable from the superb fast paced action packed series of Seasons 1 to 6. I thought Season 11 was bad enough, but I'm afraid with this offering quality has both nose dived and flat lined. I've now watched the entire set and that's it - It'll be filed in my DVD cabinet consigned to gather dust forevermore. This is quite a contrast from previous offerings - the `watchablity' factor of the original 5-0 was always high; in fact, so high that I could only stomach this offering by rewatching some episodes from Season 1 alongside of it. It really is a paradox that the earlier shows look less dated and seems fresher than the `newer' episodes of latter seasons. I love the original series - superb television from a bygone age, but for me, this last season tarnishes that memory - at best, a couple of episodes ranked as ok.

3653494,4,B001JAHQGG,"I think the original Hawaii Five-O was much better than the current effort that CBS is airing. In the final season, Kimo, Duke, Truck, and occasionally Lori are a great team to serve with Steve McGarrett.

I was slightly disappointed in the final episode in which McGarrett finally caught Wo-Fat; I think much of it was far-fetched. That being said, there are two features of the final season that stand out because they are much better than more recent efforts to portray the same idea. Firstly, in Blue Bloods much is made of Danny Reagan's unconventional methods of dealing with suspects. Kimo achieved the same effect with far more class. Second, much was made of the ending in the Sopranos in which the audience was left what happened next. Again, Hawaii Five-O achieves the effect in a much better manner: After McGarret bids Wo-Fat ""Aloha"" in a prison cell, Wo-Fat removes a file from his shoe. Did the wily Wo-Fat subsequently escape? We will never know.",1328400000,3,962,4.795180722891566

3653496,5,B001JAHQGG,"Well here we are at the final season. I literally grew up with this series from 1968 when I was six until April 5th 1980 when the final episode was shown on my eighteenth birthday.
Was this the worst season as most people claim?.No it isn't. But it wasn't the best. I read somewhere that James MacArthur said he left the show because the stories were getting stale. True. But I don't think that this is the reason that the final season semmed so bad to some. I think it was because first we lost Chin Ho in season Ten. Then James MacArthur left the show after season eleven. We, the fans were still reeling from this and it's always hard to introduce new characters into a show because people don't like change. Jack Lord must have realised this and decided to end the show so we never got used to the new team. We still had Steve and Duke and Truck reminded me of Kono from the first four seasons. But Lori was gone mid season because of what I hear was a disagreement about dress code. I don't know if this was true. But the biggest mistake was having William Smith play Steve's right hand man. Now William Smith is a good actor. Maybe too good because the season before he had played probably the worst villain in TV history. That of Falconetti on ""Rich Man,Poor Man. Although he had been in ""Laredo"" in the sixties. I think Falconetti will be his most famous role.
There were still good episodes here. But if you think this final season was bad check out the new series that is now on TV.What were they thinking. Jack Lord must be turning in his grave. What a mess.

3653517,1,B001JAHQGG,"I have only watched two episodes of season-12 so far. I have seen all the prior seasons.

The problem with this season is not just a new actor replacing Danny Williams / James MacArthur. The acting of the new actors is terrible and the scripts are even more terrible. In one episode they re-use a criminal kingpin, Ross Martin, who was arrested and convicted of murder in the prior season.

The actor replacing Danny Williams does not project his voice. You have to strain to hear him. Danny Williams was often serious, but was subtly expressive at key times. This new actor never expresses any emotion. A cardboard cut-out with a tape playing in the background would be more animated. The new actor would have been properly cast as a bad-guy.

So far; I wish I had not bought it.",1327795200,3,780,4.557142857142857
3653518,4,B001JAHQGG,"I'm giving the 12th and final season 4 stars and a big thumbs up.  And it was just as good as the previous 11 seasons. I started watching at the very beginning last April and in the last 9 months, I've watched all 12 seasons straight through and in order. As such, I feel I can give a pretty good over view. From start to finish, it was a good cop show that had action, adventure, intrigue and some interesting plots.

Now, amongst the reviews I'd read for each and every season before I got it, I saw the caveats and complaints. ""Oh, it wasn't as good after Kono left."" ""Or after Chin ho left."" ""Or Danno left."" Nonsense.

H50 was always about one character from day one till the last episode:  McGarret. And it was all about one actor that whole time as well: Jack Lord. Sure, he had a team but aside from a few lines here and there, they never really dove into the team members much at all. In the earliest days, we saw an episode that had shown Chin ho at home with his wife and their dozen kids of all ages. 6 or 7 years later, we see his daughter dating a mobster's son. At the end of the 10th season, we learn that he's got nothing but an estranged daughter in his life. ???  Not a lot of care was given to the secondary characters or their lives. so really, when Kone, Ben, chin ho, even Danny left...it didn't really matter. They were all there to act as springboards for the boss and that's fine. Frankly, Moe Keale, who played Truck in the final season, may have been the best actor out of all the Five 0 team members and Kimo did as good a job as Danno.

As for later seasons not being as good, again, nonsense. Each season, there were a few clunkers where I almost drifted off to sleep.  As for ""recycled storylines"", the most egregious offender was an episode from the early years when Kono was there---some maniac holds up in an old bunker over a highway and is terrorizing people. Not more than 2 or 3 seasons later, 6th, i think, they reused 75% of all the footage from the same episode and just inserted a different guy with a gun!  this was well before the ""lame later years"". No, the show has remained pretty consistent throughout its 12 years and that's a fact. McGarret is jumping out of copters and shootin' up the bad guys straight through.

My one regret is that Duke never became the number two guy after Danny left but I guess since he was a local and not originally an actor, much like Chin ho and Kono, he didn't get the same status. ah well.

Another complaint was that he wasn't in it much at the end. Wrong. there was an ep or two where he was off testifying on some case but that was the same thing he did many times in earlier episodes and Danny was left in charge, again, always consistent. So, don't believe any negative press- this was a solid, good cop show all the way through with the same ups and downs throughout. Buy them all.  And the whiners going on about the ""horrible transfer quality"" to DVD on season ten?  Seemed fine to me. Certainly better than VHS.  Farewell Jack, Mahalo.",1326931200,19,3026,4.2508710801393725

True there are some Turkeys also, like A Bird in Hand, The Moroville Covenat, Voice of terror etc. But enough good ones to make it worthwile. And it does have Wo Fat's final apperance and imprisionment. Picture and sound quality are very good. I give it five stars for the picture and sound, 3 stars for the episodes themselves, and four stars overall.",1326240000,4,571,4.553398058252427
3653521,5,B001JAHQGG,"I received my copy of the final season of Hawaii Five-O this week. It appears that CBS/Paramount has done a first rate job with this last season release. The video quality of the transfer and digital remastering of the set is AAA+++.A crisp and colorful picture really shows off the Hawaiian scenery in all it's glory. I have watched a couple episodes from this set,and really enjoyed them. As with any series that has run 12 years,some may complain that the content quality does not hold up to the earlier seasons. Although I will give this set five stars as it still blows away 95% of the garbage that is on tv today. Thanks CBS/Paramount for finally making the entire series available. Far too often a studio will stop releasing seasons of a series on dvd after only a couple seasons. I can now enjoy every episode of Hawaii Five-O.....all 12 great seasons of the classic series that defined cop shows.",1326240000,26,905,4.627329192546584
3653522,3,B001JAHQGG,"This show is a must to have, no matter season 12 is not as good as the previous ones. One bad thing is that there are no subtitles in portuguese or spanish, how could Paramount miss that? From season 8 to 12 Paramount simply forgot or ignored that there are H5O funs all around the world. I hope Paramount fix that as soon as possible.",1323648000,2,335,4.1692307692307695

(Jack Lord), Duke (Herman Wedemeyer), Truck Ke-
aloha (Wilfred 'Moe' Keale), Nick ['Tom Kellogg']
(Danny Kamekona, Sally [Policelady, this episode
only, played by Mary-Angela]. Villians: Anne Zim-
melman [Willa], Kaz Garaz [Mark], Cal Bellini
[Karl(Marx?!)]. Plot; When Mark and Willa dig up
some burried arms at the beginning, they try to
convince Karl(Marx, Revolutionary Terrorist...
in Hawai'i, yea sure!) that trying to take over
a radio station is too big and out in the open...

Karl then gets into a high speed chase v. Sgt. Nick
(here called Tom Kellogg in the credits, but not in
the show) and 'Probie' from the Acedemy, Mary Angela
(here w/out the - between here name in the credits...
last time we saw her in a Five-0 episode she was dou-
ble dealing in 'East Wind--Ill Wind')...Karl's car
gets spun out and in the shoot out, Nick is wounded
and Sally is taken Hostage. Karl then comes to the
conclusion that he can use the captured police car
radio to Voice his Terror(istic) demands to the pub-
lic. He cuts a deal w/ the Gov. , and McG., Duke,
Truck eventually bring him down. McGarrett shoots him
down at the end using the Communist clenched-fist sa-
lute as a signal, and wearing Mark's cap and coat to
shield his face as he comes up the hill. Duke is very
good in here and there is no Carew and Lori to screw
things up! Zimmelman, Garaz and Bellini, along w/Lord,
Wedemeyer, Denning and Kamekona bring back visions of
past good episodes with many of these regulars in them.

Word is Lord almost fired Smith that week of filming
and Sharon Farrell, who was originally supposed to play
Mary Angela's role got engaged and moved to California,
tacking her resignation to Jack Lord's trailor door! I
can't imagine this episode would have been better with
Smith, Farrell and NO Nick or Sally in it! Three stars
is about the best I can rate this as McGarrett, The Gov.,
and Duke are starting to show their age quite a bit in
here. Truck is very good also, but gets shot for the
third time in the 12th season - and he was only in 10
episodes! - Rich Salzer, Sirius Radio, 12/11/11, 4 p.m.",1323561600,3,2147,4.603133159268929
3653524,2,B001JAHQGG,"Considering that Lori (& Kevin) Wilson WENT SO
FAST INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT during the 12th season
('McGarrett'), we hardly got to know them. Several
fun and quirky things in this 'revenge' episode;
When Lori comes homw to take a shower after a bad
day (Kevin was dead @ this point, she takes off her
clothes but leaves her heels on! Plenty of Herman
'Duke' Wedemeyer in here, but no 'Truck' Kealoha
(he gets a mention though!) but Danno's absence is
noticable. Especially when it was Duke, Danno and
what's-his-name [Oh, yes...McG...] in the 11th season.

There really isn't much chemistry in the 12th season
between the cast members and McG...Duke is in 13 epi-
sodes, Carew 18 of 20, Nick reappears in two (Danny
Kamekona!!) and Lori in only 9, before Sharon Farrell
left the show to move to Hollyweird and got married in
real life. Even tall Doug Mossman (Frank in season 7,
other cop roles in the show in the 1st few years) reap-
pears in season 12 as Chief of the fictional Lono Bay
Hawai'i City. Yes, Lori catches the bad guy in the end,
who killed her husband - then in one of the most ackward
and sappy scenes in the show's history, McG asks Lori &
Kimo (Jim Carew) to join the team in the shopping Centre
parking lot!! Duke should have ask for a raise or quit
right there. No wonder Herman Wedemeyer had heart prob-
lems in season 12! Worst season fo the show and for Duke!
Two-and-a-half stars for this overrated / overwraught epi-
sode. Don't waste your time unless you're desperate - and
not a housewife! -

3653525,5,B001JAHQGG,"This is the sad end to one great TV show. Jack Lord is trying to make it work with the new people.
And can only do so much. I am happy that I will now have them all.
And can watch them as I wish.
This was when TV was great and had great shows on. Not like the trash that is on now!
I will pick this up the day it comes out.
It will not be long until I don't need cable at all.(( Update).  I caned the Cable TV...
Cut about $70.00 off my bill. Just got the High Speed Net with them now. They just did a Up-Grade on it.. Now going up to 50.
So that is fine with me...
Be well all.",1320192000,39,578,3.515625
3653526,1,B001JAHQGG,"This season is horrible . Bad writing, gasty bad acting and direction. Five-0 ran out of gas around season 8 but it limped a long because the ratings were decent ratings (more a testament how bad late 1970's tv was  . Seasons 9 and 10 was so so at best , seasons 11 and 12 are a embarrassment.  Were I live in So Cal I recently re watched last two gasty bad seasons of Five-0 on the ota oldies tv station kdoc channel 56.1 late nite . Unless you absolutely need a complete series or won the lotto and have money to burn on mystery science theater bad tv  I would advise you spend you hard earned cash on other high quality season sets. Its really really bad especially any episode with Kimo and Truck . Spend your $$$$ elsewhere you probably watch this season once and smash it for be a sucker and buying it . I really love seasons 1 - 8. Seasons 9-12 there are loads of stinker episodes with plot wholes, continuity errors, bad scripts, acting and direct . Its ssd it so bad.",1320019200,7,976,4.180851063829787

But Season 12! What a stinker! No wonder Dano left the show; he probably had a preview of the scripts. McGarrett himself looks embarrassed at some of the lines he had to read. The blonde woman who plays one of Steve's assistants couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.

Buy the first eleven series, but save your money on this one.",1504396800,2,475,4.266666666666667
