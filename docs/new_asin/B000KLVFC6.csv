8158297,3,B000KLVFC6,"I watched this film when it was first shown on British TV and really enjoyed it. For me it is the best of all the versions of Thief of Bagdad I've seen. Watching this DVD was a nostalgia trip for me but new watchers may be disappointed by the poor quality of the film. It looks slightly out of focus all the time and the colour is dull which is a real shame. In its original state it's a thoroughly entertaining and amusing film for those who enjoy Arabian style fantasy. Yes, the special effects may seem poor by today's standards but don't let that put you off. Worth watching if you don't mind that the film picture and sound quality is poor. In perfect condition I'd give it a 5 star rating.",1324857600,,695,4.2330827067669174
8158298,3,B000KLVFC6,"A good version, quite funny (what can you expect with Ustinov?)

But the sound and picture quality were not good at all!",1263513600,,120,4.454545454545454
8158299,3,B000KLVFC6,"Boasting an all-star cast (Roddy McDowell, Peter Ustinov, Terence Stamp, Kabir Bedi; Ian Holm in a minor role), this version of the classic tale is also blessed with a find script.  Unfortunately the presentation lacks the chutzpa to do the material justice.  The special effects are dated, but that we can accept, since they're pretty good for the time.  However, the focus on the DVD is on the fuzzy size, while the color is dull and somewhat faded.  While this film was originally made for TV in a time when TV presentations were 1.33:1, it was also filmed for theaters in an aspect of 1.85:1.  The version on this DVD is therefore mutilated, alas.  There seems to be some confusion as to timing.  I can assure you-all that it is the original 102 minutes.  The confusion arises because the film is inexplicably divided into 2 parts.  At 52:15, there is a tiny pause, and a new timing appears for the 2nd half (39:26).  I've played the DVD; any other timing listed is wrong.",1213833600,4,976,4.589595375722543
