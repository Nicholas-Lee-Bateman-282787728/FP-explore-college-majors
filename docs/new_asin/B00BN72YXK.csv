5657190,2,B00BN72YXK,"Ok , this is really a two or one star movie.  But it is a true shlock film,  Shlock films are awkward and  often hilarious in their earnest badness. They don't realize how bad they are! Truly bad dialog and situations that are silly make for  a fun night of true shlockness and laughs.  Ok, bad films aren't always shlock though.  This is though. Why?  IT has to be seen to be believed actually. For instance dinosaurs run across town chasing one car and then all run to the same building where are hero and his daughter are.  Treat Williams overacts in this one and has to deal with a modern daughter who can't get out of her phone. This is without a doubt a major problem for some people , and she's also rude. lol. The dialog in this one is unbelievable and clunky! true shlock, not bad filmmaking but shiocking!  The shlock scenes are too many to count in this one. I can't explain it, this is one to see and just wallow in it's dumbness, ""We made dinosaurs for your birthday party!' yes giant dinosaurs will be on lease for you to have in parades. It's insanely funny!  The cgi in this one is ok for this decade though. remember that ten years ago , this movies effects would have looked much more primitive at this budget level. IT would be a level effects from the early 1990's , not counting the super budget flicks though like Jurassic park , of that ear. If you enjoy bad movies like I do then this is a must for you. If you want to see what real shlock is like. Then watch this too. The dvd looks good here too.  If you want a good movie then you probably don't like most horror films  anyway. I enjoy them though and this is down there with the many schlocky scy fy movies I enjoy too.  But only on a higher budget. Sortof!  I saw Treat WIlliams on broadway in grease, he lost that part to jt back then in the movie, but actors need to work  even when they slip into the low b range, or c range which is made by non pros territory, and when this happens to them at least you can see that he gave it all he could  ,  even with that hilarious scene of him scowling fiercely at dinosaurs,  so it's  mostly in this flick.",1373673600,,2129,4.13625304136253
5657191,2,B00BN72YXK,"There is nothing like an Asylum film where there is a disaster and a family is trying to save itself. In this formulaic disaster, Gabe, the fireman (Treat Williams) takes his estranged daughter (Jillian Rose Reed) to an impromptu dinosaur petting zoo. It seems those wonderful folks at Geneti-Sharp have created their own Jurassic Park in their office building. Things go oops. We witness scenes already done in ""Jurassic Park"" as people play hide and seek with a meat eater.

The film is complete with blood splatter and an exploding CG helicopter. May work as a film for the 9-tween. Adults can pass on this one.

5657192,4,B00BN72YXK,"The movie has all the earmarks of a SYFY sunday afternoon movie. If you go in for movies like, ""SandShark"" and ""Mega Python vs. Gatoroid"", then take a look here. The acting is not bad at all. The plot was not the worst either. However, the CGI was just plain awesome in that ""B"" movie kind of way, which was a real treat.  (no pun intended)

 Jillian rose Reed from Awkward was very good in this movie. She brought a certain depth to a very 2 dimensional character.

5657193,1,B00BN72YXK,"Possibly the worst movie ever made. It baffles me how anyone that is so stupid and can make such a crappy movie can get the funds to make it. The only explanation I can come up with is either they have the money and just decide ""hey! I am going to make a movie, or they talked someone as stupid as they are to give them the money. There is not a single thing about any part of this movie that even has a hint of being good.

5657198,1,B00BN72YXK,"Jurassic Park (the original) was the best dinosaur movie ever made.  JP II was pretty good - still a fun romp.  But JP III - well, they abandoned things like scientific accuracy (pteranodons with teeth?) and believable story, just to cash in on the name.  I thought it was the worst dinosaur movie yet.

Until ""Age of Dinosaurs.""

Wow -- they made this in 2013?  Really?  Well, there were a few giveaways, like iPhones and the fact that the LAPD Crown Victorias were joined by some Dodge Chargers.  But you'd have to really be weird, like me, to notice that.

The special effects certainly wouldn't clue you in.  Sure, some were CGI, and some of those even moved smoothly.  The fleshy wattles on the giant (bigger than T.rex size!) Ceratosaurus were a nice touch.  But they looked like CGI -- like the helicopters -- they just didn't seem to be ""in the scene.""  Probably subtle things like lighting angle and coloration, depth of focus, environment effects like shadows, dust, footprints being off...

And some of them were kind suspiciously rubbery-looking.  Especially some of the half-size Carnotaurs (to make up for the double-size Ceratosaur, I guess), which were the main villains of the flick, playing the role of the raptors from Jurassic Park.  (Copied down to tapping claws on the floor.)

Speaking of Jurassic Park - wow.  That movie was made 20 years before, and looks -- well, 20 years newer.  This move was made last year, but the effects would be spectacular - in something like One Million Years BC.

Helicopters.  Did I mention the helicopters?  Lots of them, yet I bet they didn't spend a cent on chopper rentals.  Every bit of helicopter footage looked like either a model or a CGI model.  And someone really needs to tell them that you can't do a barrel roll in a Huey, not even a Super Huey.

The acting was, in places, almost passable.  But the script - that's another matter.

WHY was the dino they sorta activated on the table, in the opening scene, not strapped down, or caged, or restrained in some way?  If you wake up a carnivore, and it's in a room full of people and probably hungry, what exactly do you THINK will happen?  (And what were they doing with the Komodo dragon that we never got to see under the blanket?  Sounded like they were transferring its consciousness or some such - what's with that?)

WHY do they lock the building when the dinosaurs get loose, to trap all the people inside?  Dinosaurs don't know how to operate doors; people do.

WHY, when chased by dinosaurs, do they run upstairs in the mall to corner themselves?  Didn't they ever see a slash movie?  You NEVER run upstairs!

WHY do the dinosaurs prefer to kill a person, then another, then another, then run after more -- rather than actually stopping to eat their kills?

WHY do the pteranodons lift people and drop them to kill them?  It's not like they can eat people without any teeth.

WHY do they say the dinosaurs' skins are too thick, and are stopping the bullets?  These weren't ankylosaurs.

WHY did one of the little carnotaurs, when shot with a shotgun, explode in a fiery explosion?  Had it been eating fireworks or something?

WHY do the cop's guns not cycle the slides or eject shells when they seem to be shooting them?  Could it be that they were Airsoft guns used as props, because they were too cheap for blanks?  Could they be jiggling them in their hands and counting on the sound guys to dub in gunfire sounds?

WHY do the helicopters need to get within about five feet to shoot the dinos -- convenient jump-and-chomp range?

WHY was that pteranodon clinging to the front of that Blackhawk helicopter -- with its snout through the windshield?

WHY are the genetically engineered dinos grown to maturity in green glass pods, rather than embryos implanted in eggs, Jurassic-Park style?  Could it be that a horde of cute little hatchling dinos just isn't scary enough?

WHY do all the 100 or so dinos, when they get loose, all charge down the same street together, to trample a few digital cop cars?  The putative explanation was that they were ""following the scent trail"" of the previous meat-eaters that chased Our Heroes into the shopping mall.  Following the scent trail at top speed, as a mixed herd.  Herbivores following the scent trail of carnivores - riiiiight.  Wouldn't herbivores, the customary prey, choose to go any way BUT where the carnivores were?

WHY were the cops wearing bulletproof vests?  Did they expect the dinosaurs to shoot back at them?

WHY do the helicopters defy the laws of physics by flying kinda sideways (not in a good helicopter-tricky way)?  Why didn't those two helicopters' rotors hit each other when they flew so close?

WHY did they end up on the Hollywood sign?  Is it a favorite nesting spot or something?

HOW did we get the privilege of seeing a Spinosaurus shot down, by a helicopter, from the twenty-leventh floor on the exterior of a skyscraper? -- mere seconds after they all broke out of their glass incubation pods -- which were, by the way, far too small for the Spinosaur, the T.rexes, and the big-ol' full-size sauropod we saw in the stampede.

Believe it or not, I could go on and on with more examples like that.  But the biggest question is probably:

WHY did I watch this movie to the end?  (And WHY didn't they give us any resolution of the situation at the end?  Do they think people will demand a sequel to this stinker?)

I guess I just had to see how bad it was.  And it was.

5657214,4,B00BN72YXK,"I've seen much worse, much worse.
Rudimentary at best, this knockoff borrows (steals) from many other films.  The plot is a bit sketchy, something to do with bio-technology and medicine.  How they got dinosaurs from that is anyone's guess, apparently the loopy CEO (Ronny Cox) thought they were contained/tamed/a novelty for sporting events, maybe even pets!  They thought it would be cool to regenerate ""meat eaters"" first.  What could go wrong?  Enter a dopey dad (Treat Williams) who thought his daughter would like to attend the dinosaurs coming out party.  What could go wrong?  They had over 100 dinosaurs to be distributed (party favors?).  The trouble starts when Larry breaks out.  (Isn't that cute, they named them.)  What follows is a lot of atrocious dialog, general all-purpose mayhem, chomping, stomping.......  The movie fares best when it doesn't feature any of the characters.  When the dinosaurs stampede it's sublime.  When the cast try to `act' it's almost painful to watch.  They either try too hard or not hard enough, the worst of the lot being Jullian Rose Reed (playing the daughter with a watered down version of an ""attitude"").
Everything about this movie feels as though they made it up on the spot; no rehearsals, no second thoughts.  There are a lot of elements that are just lame.
This was a crap shoot but I liked it for that and the unapologetic way in which they presented it.  (I'm sure Ronny Cox and Treat Williams were happy to take the money and run.  What does desperation pay these days?)

5657216,3,B00BN72YXK,"*may contain spoilers*

Classic B movie, not classic like Killer Klowns from Outerspace or Night of the Comet, but if you don't take this movie too seriously and can ignore the bad SFX, acting/plot, you might enjoy the movie. Keep your expectations low and you won't be too disappointed.
Treat Williams does okay and I really wondered if him and the old guy did this movie as a favor for someone. There is some salty language, but no F*bombs. My 10 and under crowd enjoyed the action and even the poorly rendered dinos, and as for myself, I found a movie where I could be on the look out for plot holes(the ending?), impossible scenarios (dinos what won't die from missles, but from a hockey stick/2x4), continuity and humor (uncle's death scene).
This is good movie to watch when you are recovering from wisdom tooth surgery or anything where you are stuck in bed all day. If you fall asleep, you won't miss much and you won't feel too bad about it.
Yes, this reeks of Jurassic Park and I'd like to believe that Asylum was trying to pay homage to them in their own way.
We rented it from Red Box, and I don't think I would invest to keep this one on digital or DVD, but if was a free download from Vudu, I wouldn't complain.",1381363200,,1225,4.37280701754386
5657217,3,B00BN72YXK,"I had sworn off buying ANY more movies by The Asylum -- the dozen or more I saw, were so universally poorly made -- but this one slipped through the door and ambushed me.

The plot's a bit thin; some dialogue is silly (and not even Treat Williams, looking Grim, could save it)... BUT the dinosaur-related special effects are surprisingly good. Obviously, this time they somehow had a budget to work with. In fact, the dinosaurs in this film were more believable than some of the pop-up-pastry-looking, teeny-people-being-chomped-at-a-distance effects.

This movie was fun, fast-moving, and not a bad offering for family movie night with your teens. (Some scenes, though passing quickly, might be too gory for little kids.)",1379894400,,722,5.110169491525424

5657223,5,B00BN72YXK,"Age of Dinosaurs was better than Jurassic Park in several ways.  First, the dinosaurs were introduced sooner.  Second, there were no romantic dynamics taking away from dino screen time.  Third, there was a lot more types of dinosaurs and they wreaked more havoc that did the ones in the Jurassic Park series.  Do you remember the one time we saw a Triceratops in Jurassic Park, it was dying?

The acting was excellent.  Treat Williams plays, Gabe, a widowed fireman who takes his teenage daughter Jade to see something very cool, but ends up trying to save Jade from escaped dinos.  Jade is a piece of work.  Bratty, rude, disrespectful of her father, she leaves in the middle of the event and goes to text her boyfriend.  Dad is calling - oh, just hit 'ignore.'  The most compelling and complex character is Justin Juarisco (Ronny Cox).  He is the head of Geneti-Sharp.  His company is known for their flesh-rengenerating products that heal burn patients completely.  Justin has also secretly used his companies expertise to rebuild dinosaurs of every kind with just a single DNA sample.  Justin is not greedy.  He genuinely wants to help people.  He has absolute faith in the scientists who work for him to keep the public safe.  That was his mistake.  Through the ovie he is urged to flee in a Geneti-Sharp private helicopter  But he refuses to leave when people are dying  He feels tremendous guilt and shame.

The special effects, especially the dinosaurs, were excellent.  Way better than Jurassic Park.  The sets, orchestral musical score, also excellent.  All filmed in Los Angeles.",1374883200,2,1590,4.868913857677903
