8565063,5,B00BAY5FA0,"This is not actually a review - more of a comment.  Charlie is America's greatest and most intelligent interviewer.  His range of expertise on almost any subject is unmatched.
I have two problems with Charlie Rose.  The first is that I have been unable to find a way to write to him at his studio.  Perhaps if I participated in Facebook or Twitter, there might be a way to reach him to make comments and ask questions - but neither is for me.  Secondly, the price he asks for his DVD's never wavers. It is impossible to even buy used copies to get a lower price.  So - I never buy them, much as I may want to.
It would appear Charlie isn't that interested in his DVD sales, which is unfortunate for those of us who cannot afford $25 plus shipping and follow him faithfully.  I would dearly like to purchase some of his most memorable interviews, i.e. Bill Nighy, Peter O'Toole and some of the greatest figures of our time.  Too bad for us.",1410307200,2,939,4.295454545454546
