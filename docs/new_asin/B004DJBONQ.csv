8425407,4,B004DJBONQ,"Pumping soundtrack, sick waves, and JOB shredding. The section intros about his life are amusing the first time around, but be ready to hit the FF button on subsequent viewings. Whatever you think about this guy, it's hard not to admire his surfing. Great vid.",1362009600,,260,4.8
8425408,5,B004DJBONQ,"This movie is one of the sickest videos Ive seen in a while. The dubstep soundtrack immediately gets me pumped and the surfing is amazing. It arrived earlier than expected and in great, new condition!",1355875200,,200,4.742857142857143
8425409,5,B004DJBONQ,"Hands down my second favorite dvd. I love to watch this before going to the bars, or while driving to the ocean to surf. Something about th music and the footage just amps you up!
A great mix of his life and what it's like to be a Haloe in Hawaii, and then rediculous pipe line barrels and close up go pro shots! I saw this dvd at a premier with Jamie O himself and was hooked since then. Probably watched this movie over 50 times.",1339372800,,431,4.023255813953488
8425410,5,B004DJBONQ,"Not the best surfing movie ever, but not far off.  Awesome soundtrack and editing.  Gets better with each veiwing as you start to see the nuances of the tricks, etc.  Even if not a fan of JOB (ex. intro), there's a good chance you will dig this video.",1332547200,,251,4.1875
8425411,5,B004DJBONQ,"Best surf movie ever? There is no BEST movie ever. This for sure is one of the best though! I own over 60 titles and this is the largest collection of jaw dropping footage I've ever seen. I LOVE the sound track which syncs up as good as anything I've ever seen/heard and the interviews are coldly honest but give you a real insight into the man giving you the feeling like you know him and what he's about. Then there's the cinematography that pulls it all together - arty shots that take you by surprise but WORK! I've watched this DVD over and over and if I need to get stoked for a workout, I pop in the opening sequence and I'm as amped as I need to be! If you only buy one surf DVD, this should be it. If you own 100 DVDs, you should add this to your collection! I can't believe how good this thing is......BUY THIS NOW!!",1322697600,2,826,4.07361963190184
8425412,3,B004DJBONQ,"cool how he told his bio of being deaf and teased in early childhood. a lot of big wave stuff, i personally was hoping for more head high stuff with all the moves he has got in his repertoire.",1295568000,,192,3.948717948717949
8425413,5,B004DJBONQ,"My first exposure to Jamie O was ""Freak Show,"" and it blew me away. The dude's balance is uncanny, and I am gonna throw out there that when it comes to barrel riding -- no one can touch him. Like most of you guys reading this review, I couldn't wait for this film to come out. I first saw the trailer over a year and a half ago, and have been frothing ever since. That being said, I watched it for the first time last night and its hands down worth the hype. Trust. Just watch it.",1294012800,,480,3.9587628865979383
