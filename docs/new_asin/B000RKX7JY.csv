8201171,5,B000RKX7JY,"RINGO STARR & HIS ALL STARR BAND-LIVE: 1989's inaugural edition of RINGO'S ALL STARR BAND (the first and best of a dozen lineups over the past three decades) was the perfect opportunity to catch THE BEATLES beat keeper backed by a who's who of classic rockers. Interspersing solo hits (IT DON'T COME EASY, PHOTOGRAPH) with those he sang in the Fab Four, (HONEY DON'T, ACT NATURALLY, YELLOW SUBMARINE), the microphone also gets passed around to THE BAND's LEVON HELM and RICK DANKO, THE E STREET BAND's CLARENCE CLEMONS and NILS LOFGREN, Big Easy ivory tickler DR. JOHN, gonzo guitar slinger JOE WALSH, and ""sideman to the stars"" BILLY PRESTON for a trademark ditty or two apiece. WALSH unleashes an eight minute blooze-fueled jam of his anthem ROCKY MOUNTAIN WAY and growls out LIFE IN THE FAST LANE, while drummer HELM locks into a funk-fortified groove with bassist DANKO for THE WEIGHT and THE SHAPE I'M IN. ""Fifth BEATLE"" BILLY PRESTON busts out the crowd pleasing WILL IT GO ROUND IN CIRCLES and CLEMONS, known more for his wailin' sax than his gruff, soulful vocals, modernizes GARY ""U.S."" BONDS party starter QUARTER TO THREE with additional (semi-rapped) lyrics. STARR, the charismatic ringmaster of this rock & roll circus is energetic and congenial throughout the proceedings; inevitable encore WITH A LITLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS becomes a thousands strong sing-along, capping off this once in a lifetime event in euphoric ""peace and love"" style.
