8195542,5,B000QCU52A,"Finally, the truth of the west's most notorious outlaw is revealed. The cinematography is superb!",1436486400,,97,5.533333333333333
8195543,1,B000QCU52A,"As a history buff I get quite aggravated at people that insist on bringing up the ""Brushy Bill Roberts"" lie and continue questioning whether Billy The Kid was really killed by Pat Garrett. Whether you call him McCarty, Antrim, or Bonney, ""The Kid"" was definitely and without doubt killed by Pat Garrett on the date and place stated in the true historical record.
It is also proven beyond any doubt that ""Brushy Bill Roberts"" was an outrageous liar.
For example: There are several published 20th century interviews with people who were at Ft. Sumner when ""The Kid"" was killed and around six of them prepaired his corpse; and they all knew ""The Kid"" very well.
Billy The Kid was literate, known from letters he personally penned to Governor Lew Wallace yet ""Brushy Bill"" could barely write his name.
Modern photo analysis proves ""Brushy Bill"" a liar. Roberts was poor and I am sure could not afford the orthodontics necessary to fix Billy The Kid's well known buck teeth; if they even had such procedures back then.
And Roberts just doesn't quit. Prior to his Billy The Kid claim, Roberts was bragging that he rode with Jesse James.
With just that small evidence I cited (and there is much more available to anyone with an Internet connection) there is absolutely no doubt Garrett killed ""The Kid"". It also seems that most ""Brushy Bill"" fans fail to recognize that ""Brushy Bill Roberts"" was alive when he was totally discredited by New Mexico Governor Thomas Mabry when Roberts attempted to receive a ""pardon"" from Mabry. Also, during his interview with Mabry, Roberts could not even remember Pat Garrett's name.
Anyone that gives the the slightest credence to the ""Brushy Bill"" story does nothing but mislead future generations by furthering a lie which is infecting historical fact.
One must also ask one's self why Pat Garrett would jeopardize his career by lying. A lot of people back then hated Garrett and would have quickly come forward to discredit him, especially at the time he was appointed Customs Agent by the President of The United States.
So, people that believe or even say ""maybe"" about Roberts would likely believe that John Wilkes Booth died of old age, JFK survived and died many years later in an institution and the Titanic did not founder on April 15th, 1912.",1226188800,11,2281,4.821428571428571
8195544,5,B000QCU52A,"When I first watched this film, I was leery of what a French filmmaker would do with this material. I was surprised when I saw that for the relatively small amount of data onscreen, they pretty much got it right. The idea of Billy as a seriel killer or a psycho is pretty much refuted by everyone (including Garrett) who ever knew him, and his list of shootings was spectacularly unimpressive. In short, dime novels and bad movies live on while those who believe in them evidently haven't paid attention to the weight of evidence against this myth. This isn't to say that every outlaw was a saint, and neither was Billy, but Billy was subject to the same mythologizing as Calamity Jane and others who's lives, while adventurous, weren't exactly as books and t.v. have portrayed.

Instead of ""artsy,"" I found the cinematography gorgeous to the point of hypnotic, and it gave a nice background to the areas Henry (Billy) traveled through or lived in. New Mexico has some of the most beautiful scenery in the U.S. All this, and the interviews with the locals and old timers, lent an aura of realism to the film. If anyone wants to watch something that is visually engaging and has much of its info right on a general level, I highly recommend this film, as it captures the feel of it all. Then go watch other more mundane documentaries and read books on the subject. I would recommend more recent publications that have actually done the research, however, as many older ones haven't a clue.",1212192000,4,1488,4.636363636363637
8195545,1,B000QCU52A,"Hmmm...so a serial killer is mythologized, with a narration provided by a warm and witty old-man, and the one who eliminates the menace from the face of the earth (Garrett) is portrayed as having to do a ""dirty job."" Throw in a few grizzled, has-been, c-list baby-boomers who have nothing else to do and still harbor hatred towards Nixon (36 years later after he resigned!), and you have mythology at its best. If you want to know the real Billy the Kid, look into the characters of people like Ted Bundy and H.H. Holmes. But if you are interested in perpetuating the myth, this movie will be right up your alley.",1212192000,2,613,4.531531531531532
8195546,5,B000QCU52A,"This was a great movie. It covered a very interesting topic
and brought it home to where it took place. I hope someday
modern science can determine if Billy was killed by Pat
Garrett or lived to a ripe old age. Beautiful scenery in
Lincoln County NM.",1197072000,3,250,4.340425531914893
8195547,4,B000QCU52A,"The myth of Billy the Kid lives on and on, yet still underground.  This film is unique in its approach comparing the young gangster, Billy the Kid, whose outlaw life lasted a brief six years, to an interesting look-alike, Arthur Rimbaud - a French poet whose world-impacting writing lasted a brief six years.  Both Billy and Rimbaud gave up at age 21.

The photography of Lincoln County alone, is worth seeing: exquisite.  Was it really Billy who was shot?  Or did he live on as Brushy Bill Roberts?  Local characters discuss it all from the No Scum Allowed Bar in the old mining town of White Oaks, New Mexico.

The film soundly held my interest throughout.  It is no wonder it won awards at the Cannes Film Festival.",1196899200,3,718,4.5546875
8195548,4,B000QCU52A,"This is a great ruminative doc on the contrasting myths of the west - romantically as a legend, cinematically as in Kristopherson's incarnation of Billy, and contemporary with the inclusion of Lincoln NM's current cast of characters.  Lot's of fun and beautifully shot.  Yes - it's a different kind of doc. But that's what makes it all the more appealing.",1196035200,6,355,4.9
8195549,4,B000QCU52A,"I have mixed feelings about the artsy fusion of traditional informational doc format with a more 'elevated' (and sometimes painterly) filmmaking effort done here.  Can't say I like Kristopherson's inclusion in this, either.  Having said both these things, this is a doc that is different and one I will return to a few times (down the road a piece.)

If you are looking for History Channel stuff, this one is not from that mold.  That can be quite a good thing (and I do look forward to seeing other efforts from this film maker.)  Now that I know the layout of this doc, I will re-watch with a less critical eye and see how it plays on second viewing.",1195603200,6,652,4.445378151260504
