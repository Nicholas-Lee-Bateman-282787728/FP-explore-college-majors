I may have seen five minutes of it as I scrolled through it to see if at some point the movie improved.  Complete waste of time.  I'm sad Amazon offers it.",1394064000,,306,4.135593220338983

to cult horror shocker cannibal holocaust that came no 12
in the list of 72 publications prosecutions of the obscene publications act
in the 1980;s that warranted an additional 5min 44 secs cuts
for scenes of gratified and graphic rape  to women and in
2001 and a 15 secs cut in 2011 under the cruelty to animals
but the follow up is a lesser sequel more of an movie of vengeance
then eating monkeys brains and decapitating guys dicks
