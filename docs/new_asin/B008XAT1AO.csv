The historical recreations are intense, layered and detailed with great care in the special effects and historical truth and authenticity along with the powerful voice of narrator Coby Batty and other voice actors help to bring these stories of the Medal of Honor to life for a mass audience - from the Civil War to the War in Afghanistan.",1356220800,2,478,4.7023809523809526

This 3-Disc collection contains over 7 Hours of interesting documentaries about the US's most celebrated War Heroes, spanning over 300 years of war history. Both series you'll find on this set are interesting and a good addition to any library. If, like me, you enjoy watching historical documentaries and you enjoy learning more about the great Wars and the courageous soldiers who fought in them, then you'll enjoy this DVD Set.
