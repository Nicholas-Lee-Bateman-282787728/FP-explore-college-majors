The singers are fabulous and the chorus - great. I will enjoy this piece for years to come. Subtitles would have been helpful as I sometimes had difficulty understand the words. Part of that is because of the British pronounciation. I hear with American ears. That, however, did not stop the power of this music.  It's well worth a listen.",1354665600,3,487,4.597701149425287

Well, he is.  And this production includes great singers, including the great Porgy of the Porgy and Bess DVD production.
A Must in any chorale collection.",1277337600,,219,5.083333333333333

Yeah, it does kind of look like a violin, but it's not!",1118102400,5,129,4.16
