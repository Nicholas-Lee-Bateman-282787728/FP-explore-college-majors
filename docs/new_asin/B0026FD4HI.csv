8352567,5,B0026FD4HI,"This is a clear and simple discussion of how the ancient Jewish documents we call the Bible has come to us down through the ages. Mr. Benner is not theological nor promotes a particular English version but offers insight into the process of transmission from origination, to preservation, to translation to interpretation of the meaning of passages. This video should be shown to every Sunday School class and Bible Study group in the Christendom.",1375142400,,447,5.054054054054054
