4992487,4,B006IXRK7Y,"Very good instruction and seems to be an authentic, classic Kettlebell workout.  One section demonstrates all the exercises.  Next, there are 3 workouts.  The first one uses two kettlebells,  the other two use one kettlebell.  I did not give it 5 stars because I have used other kettlebell DVD's that use more creative moves and provide more of an aerobic workout.  Also, some of the moves were too advanced for me.",1333065600,6,415,4.774647887323944
4992488,2,B006IXRK7Y,"This video is so boring and not motivating at all! Lisa is superimposed into the video (it's like she is in a mirrored ballet studio) which is annoying all by itself. Then, she does one exercise at a time, counts reps and gives you these 20 to 60 second breaks and calls it ""interval training"". Not my definition of interval training when you are doing nothing for 20 to 60 seconds.  I started doing 30 to 45 second planks in between just to keep busy.  She just moves from one boring exercise to the next and does not mix it up at all. If this were a ""class"" at a gym, I would never go back.

She does have excellent technique, I will give her that.  And, some of the exercises are challenging, but she just didn't motivate me to want to do any part of this video again.  I did 2 out of the 3 workouts as the first workout requires two kettlebells.  The double kettlebell workout did appear even more challenging (I just watched it since I didn't have two kettlebells of the same weight), however, once again, Lisa just does one exercise after another with an ""interval break"" in between.  Not my cup of tea!",1333065600,5,1109,4.302884615384615
4992489,5,B006IXRK7Y,"If you're an advanced exerciser and tried Lisa's first DVD, but found it non-challenging, this one is for you. It has everything that the first one was lacking. I'm so glad she changed the format in that you can completely follow along, not just suggestions of what you can do. If you need extra instructions to perfekt the moves it is thoroughly covered. Then there are 3 main workouts. One double-bell, one interval and one total body. The rest periods in-between are very appropriate (not too long) and it reminded me a little of Art of Strength/Providence. While you rest, a screen displays what exercises come up next. Each workout is about 20 minutes, or so. There is no special warmup, so I like to add it onto other workouts, but the DVD has a cool/down stretch option. Lisa has a great personality and is easy to follow. I also like her physique. Highly recommend this DVD.",1332979200,2,882,4.624203821656051
4992490,5,B006IXRK7Y,"This is a great follow-up dvd to her first, more basic one. Lisa does a fantastic job instructing as she goes through the workouts, in addition to very comprehensive instruction  section for each individual exercise.  I highly recommend practicing each move along with her instructional component before moving on to her workouts. I like the way she recommends stretching during the rest breaks and she has a good cool-down stretching component, which was lacking on the first dvd.  I also want to commend Lisa for being available and responsive to email questions.  It's almost like having a personal trainer when you combine the effective workout with reminders on form throughout and her willingness to answer questions via email!  I love that she has not one, but three separate workouts on this dvd, too.  I'm getting great results using it!",1325203200,3,846,5.0503597122302155
4992491,5,B006IXRK7Y,Lisa your video is amazing. I am so impressed that I don't need to spend hours in the gym to tone up and be more fit. Thank you for your video and keep up the good work.,1324857600,,169,3.5945945945945947
4992492,5,B006IXRK7Y,"I have known Lisa for many years and I have always been impressed by her dedication to training and passion for sharing her extensive knowledge with others. Lisa has a background in fitness figure so she clearly knows how to get into great shape. Over the last few years she has developed a very effective kettlebell training system that shows the masses how to lose fat and develop a high level of fitness using kettlebells as the centerpiece. I have met many of her personal training clients that rave about the results they have achieved working with Lisa. Unfortunately not everyone has access to Lisa personally and that is where her DVD's come in.

Lisa's last DVD was excellent and a great option for beginners. This DVD is right up my ally and is great for advanced trainees. It is loaded with highly effective exercises such as the kettlebell deck squat, renegade row, jerk, snatch, clean and front squat, double clean and push press, and many more.

The DVD starts with detailed instruction on all of the exercises in the follow along workouts. Great place to start to get your form dialed in. Lisa has worked with many of the best KB instructors around including Steve Cotter, Valery Federenko, and Marty Farrell. She is the only female with a kettlebell sport training background that I am aware of making kettlebell DVD's. This is important as the best kettlebell training information is coming from Russia and instructors that have not taken the time to at least be exposed to this style of training are doing a serious disservice to their clients. You cannot call yourself a real kettlebell expert if you have never worked with the kettlebell style that the best in the world use.

The workouts are like getting a personal training session with Lisa. You are instructed on when to start the exercise and all of the breaks between exercises are dialed in as well. Technique pointers are offered on each exercise to keep you focused while you train hard. I like the way this is set up rather than a literal follow along DVD in which you never put the bells down. You can never go heavy enough with that format to really build muscle which is critical to win the battle against fat. The way Lisa has the workouts set-up is similar to how I design circuit training style workouts for my clients that emphasize building strength and improving body composition.

This will be a DVD that you use often and if you have been disappointed with other follow along KB DVD's you really need to get this one and learn what real kettlebell training is all about. Great job Lisa!",1324425600,11,2578,4.671806167400881
4992493,4,B006IXRK7Y,"Good:
The actual workout part is good.  I feel sore the next day and that is good.
Bad:
She is a bit dull and the green screen is terrible.  She takes too many breaks and they are too long.  I normally do other sets while I am waiting for her workout to start again.",1388966400,,266,3.888888888888889
4992494,5,B006IXRK7Y,"I started off with volume one of this DVD and volume two did not disappoint. I agree that the superimposed image of the instructor is somewhat off putting, but not enough to stop me from enjoying this vigorous workout. I especially love the double bell work. I only wish there were more isolated ab exercises, but, that's really my only other complaint.",1366329600,,353,4.709677419354839
4992495,5,B006IXRK7Y,"This is an amazing, kick butt Kettlebell workout. I've read reviews from people complaining about the breaks.  If you don't need the breaks in this workout then you need to use a heavier bell...because if done right these workouts will kick your butt! I promise!

Challenge your body, workout with this DVD. You will be amazed at the results!",1361059200,,342,4.779661016949152
4992496,5,B006IXRK7Y,"I just came across to this DVD more or less by accident -- I don't know how it escaped my radar -- but now I'm very happy that I have it. I'm a Steve Cotter, Steve Maxwell graduate and I was very happy to find this excellent follow along DVD with spotless technique and cues.  The moves are put together very thoughtfully and the instructions are spot on. Lisa is clearly very knowledgeable about kettlebell training and her technique is perfect.
As for the long breaks -- you do need them when you are using challenging size kettlebells.
Way to go Lisa, I hope you will make more DVDs!",1356048000,,586,4.376146788990826
4992497,5,B006IXRK7Y,"I love Lisa's video. I have both of her videos and try to mirror her in all my moves. She is an awesome instructor, and keeps me coming back for it!
I do not find the computer studio a distraction, I am looking at her, not the lay out of the background.
I like the rest breaks, if you are using a heavy weight, you need them!",1352678400,,325,3.8656716417910446
4992498,5,B006IXRK7Y,"I noticed too many reviews focused on the production quanlity of this video.  Although it does appear to be personally financed, this DVD is excellent if you want a great KB workout.  Like all resistence style workouts, you need the correct weight. Invest in a challenging KB for you.",1348617600,,284,4.775510204081633
4992499,1,B006IXRK7Y,"This DVD is a joke!!  Her techniques are OK, but there are more shots of her ""Bombshells"" than necessary. Did not feel she was sincere at all, maybe because she wasn't even in the studio LOL. Terrible filming.

She has ZERO personalty to go with her techniques. What is which the rocking back and forth on the swing????? NEVER have seen that before. I am certified and have been training with KB's for 7 years.
Kettlebells are the best out there but this DVD is NOT!!",1347408000,2,467,4.4186046511627906
4992500,2,B006IXRK7Y,"The exercises are fine and well-demonstrated, but as so many others have noted, the ridiculous rest breaks with terrible graphics and annoying, ominous music is a big waste. I prefer a workout that flows. Having to stop and fast forward through these really bogs down the experience. Consequently, I just don't bother with this workout. I'd rather do Bob Harper's DVDs if I have the time or Jillian Michaels' half-hour shreds if I'm pressed for time. Very disappointing, poorly designed and over-priced.",1344988800,2,503,5.146341463414634
4992501,2,B006IXRK7Y,"I really like Lisa's 1st DVD! This one however is not good at all. As others have said she is not even really in a studio. She is Computer imposed there, and it is so annoying to watch it because it is so obvious! The moves are very boring. When Lisa talks she is always looking to the left a little. There is something so off about doing these exercises. I just could not get over her not being seen in the mirror behind her ??? I will stick with her first one, but don't wast your money on this one.",1334534400,3,501,3.9702970297029703
4992502,5,B006IXRK7Y,"Lisa has the best KB instruction, which is very important to prevent injury. I prefer authentic KB exercises to made up tiny weight, poor form dancing around type exercises found on most other KB DVD's. It is clear that she knows her stuff and is an experienced instructor. If you are new to KB's get her first DVD and get this one after.",1333152000,,338,4.380952380952381
8499108,4,B006IXRK7Y,"First of all, I love kettlebells. I was hesitant to purchase because of cover and title, to be honest. When the video started, I almost turned it off. I was glad I didn't. It's actually a pretty good little workout. Lisa goes through each basic exercise. Be aware that this is ""sport"" style of kettle bell training.",1524528000,,315,4.543859649122807
8499109,3,B006IXRK7Y,her continuous posing on a faux green screen back drop is distracting and funny. Workouts are good though.,1450742400,,106,4.944444444444445
8499110,5,B006IXRK7Y,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this workout DVD!!  I had debated whether to order her beginner workout first, but I'm so glad I just went with this advanced version. I have worked out with kettlebells before, yet was a bit worried this may be too difficult. I am a 55 y.o. woman, workout regularly, and have found this to be the ideal kettlebell workout I was looking for. Lisa does a great job explaining the movements, and I find her pace very doable. I highly recommend this workout for anyone looking for a fabulous weight workout - kettlebells get your whole body involved in the movements and they condition the entire body.",1450051200,5,616,4.6
8499111,2,B006IXRK7Y,"Disclaimer: This is the second of a series. If you are more of a kettlebell novice, I would recommend trying her other one first. I ordered it through the library, so I didn't realize there was one more suited toward beginners. I consider myself middle of the road in terms of my kettlebell expertise.

The Good:
-Her instructional section is broken up by exercise instead of one large introduction section. This allows you to watch particularly difficult moves again and again (and some of them are quite hard!).
-She gives generous rest periods in her actual exercise routines, at times almost too long.

The Bad:
-There are three sets of exercise routines. The first involves two kettlebells. What if you don't have two kettlebells to use (like me)? Too bad. She says at the beginning she will offer suggestions for modification if you only have one, but after 5 minutes I realized this wasn't true.
-There is very little segue into the next move. The screen will say the name, but if you cannot remember a certain move by name then you could be 1 or 2 reps behind because Lisa typically starts the next move as soon as the rest timer finishes. She does keep things moving, but too quickly sometimes.",1446422400,7,1203,4.669811320754717
8499112,5,B006IXRK7Y,Excellent!  Only DVD I use and will ever use!,1434585600,,45,4.0
8499113,5,B006IXRK7Y,This is such a great workout DVD!!!! Love all 3 of the workouts...Lisa gives great demos of all the exercises..2 of the workouts are 1 Kettlebell workouts and 1 is a double Kettlebell workout..Really gets your heart rate up and kicks your butt in short time...,1427932800,2,260,4.673913043478261
8499114,5,B006IXRK7Y,"This is an EXCELLENT workout!!  I know there have been several reviews saying people didn't like this DVD: it was obvious she wasn't in a real studio, there were too many rests, etc.  If you are concerned with getting a fantastic workout, building muscle, and burning fat then the green screen will not bother you!  If you are using a heavy enough bell, then you will NEED the rest periods she gives you!  I can not say enough good things about this DVD or her beginner DVD.  Thank you Lisa, for putting this out there and for helping me reach my workout goals!!!!",1421884800,3,564,4.436893203883495
8499115,4,B006IXRK7Y,"This is a great workout. The video is a little strange, but I got over that because I enjoyed the workout. I like that the instructor takes times to explain how to do the movement correctly, instead of just assuming the viewer knows!",1413244800,,233,4.441860465116279
8499116,5,B006IXRK7Y,"I love kettlebell workouts and have a variety of kettlebell dvds including AOS, lauren brooks, skogg, rks, mark de grasse, steve cotter, steve maxwell etc. I also have a number of ones from instructors who are fitness instructors who have jumped on the kettlebell bandwagon and produced decent kettlebell videos (bob harper, amy bento, etc). Kettlebell bombshell is mostly sport style (can easily translate to hard style if you prefer) but ""traditional"" kettlebell workout meaning the intent is to use as heavy a kettlebell as you can to perform the movements with good form. This is not fast paced cardio style kettlebell workout ala Bob Harper in which one uses a lighter kettlebell, faster and for more reps. Instead, this is more along the lines of Mark de Grasse. there are 3 20 minute workouts on this video with the double kettelbell being my favorite. The rest periods are not too long if one is using the proper weight. As a female, I use anywhere from 25-35 lb kettlebells for these 3 workouts (for the doubles I dropped down to 20lb each arm for some). If you use the proper weight, you get good strength and cardio.  I was initially annoyed by the odd look of the video but quickly got used to it. I do wish there had been a timer on the video but still rated this a 5 star based on the work out as a whole.",1409270400,3,1319,4.495833333333334
8499117,4,B006IXRK7Y,"This DVD has some really great workouts on it. I like the variety, so I'm not feeling like I do the same thing every day. They are very challenging, but can be modified if necessary to be easier or more difficult. It's essential to watch the exercise demonstrations (a workout in and of themselves) if you've never done kettlebell before, because you want to make sure you use proper form, and Lisa does a good job of showing you how to do them properly.",1389571200,2,454,4.416666666666667
