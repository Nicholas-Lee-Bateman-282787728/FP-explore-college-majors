6860302,5,B00Q7SF0QI,"If your a fan of pro wrestling during the peak of its popularity in the late 90's early 00's this is a must watch. Great documentary series covering all the major aspects of the period with new interviews with many of the key participants. And great footage from all 3 of the major promotions of the time- WWE,WCW and ECW.  Some people say that WWE programs are way too one sided in regards to the Monday night wars by making them out to be so much better then WCW but really, as more of a WCW fan at the time, I can say WCW has no one to blame for their failure then themselves. WCW had the talent to compete but was just so horribly managed that when I remember some of the stuff they did it just makes me shake my head in amazement. But it was all fun! And this doc does a great job capturing that. This has the first 10 episodes with the remaining 10 on volume 2 coming out soon. Also has post episode interviews with Triple H and Sting that run about 5 minutes each.",1438214400,4,971,4.0837696335078535
6860303,4,B00Q7SF0QI,"Really enjoyed this set. I didn't get in to wrestling until 1998, so I missed the majority of the Monday Night Wars. I have been able to relive the era through various DVDs that the WWE has released over the years. It's nice that this set doesn't just chronicle events or matches that took place, but also the decisions made, backstage politics, mindsets, etc. The only thing I didn't care for, were some of the interviews were re-used. For example, the Bischoff interviews were from either WWE Confiedential interviews, or from the initial Monday Night War DVD that was released back in 2004. Some of the interviews with Kevin Nash and Sean Waltman were from the nWo DVD set that was released in 2014. However, in all cases they did enhance the content, and all in all, it's something very minor. If you're a wrestling fan or lived through the Wars, I highly recommend this series and can't wait until Volume 2 comes out this Fall.",1436745600,3,932,4.620481927710843
6860304,1,B00Q7SF0QI,"The WWE has conveniently, even eloquently, misplaced pieces of their history in an attempt to rewrite history to suit their needs. At times it is blatantly obvious that they are trying to diminish WCW's successes and ignore their own short comings.

Renee Young is also biased during the sit-down interview with Sting and HHH, only asking Sting for his opinion on WCW's failures and WWE's successes, completely ignoring asking him about how it felt to be on an 82-week ratings winning streak, his own successes and the things WCW did right.

In order to rewrite history with false facts, Eric Bischoff is noticeably absent with his clips being strategically placed in the documentary, and for good reason, as he would have conflicted with the false story WWE is trying to sell to the masses.

Sting's comments during the DVD preview on the WWE network about how WWE misused former WCW stars PURPOSELY is excluded as well as Triple H's response that this was done by design to bury those WCW stars.

As a result, true fans will notice the political and petty games WWE is playing with this DVD. It is good entertainment, however from the historical point of view, its historical facts are inaccurate and illogical at times and as a result it is a terrible account of the Monday Night War.

6860305,4,B00Q7SF0QI,"""The Monday Night War"" was one of the most anticipated shows by audiences for the WWE Network chronicling the competition between World Wrestling Entertainment & World Championship Wrestling during that period of time over a series of 20 episodes with each one focusing on a specific subject or superstar involved throughout that time period.  This volume is the first half of the series (10 episodes) that features various interviews from talent & management who were involved or fans of that period of time time including C.M. Punk, John Cena, Jerry Lawler, The McMahons (Vince, Linda, Stephanie, Shane), Michael Hayes, Hulk Hogan, Michael Cole, Ric Flair, Bret Hart, Lex Luger, Kevin Nash, Daniel Bryan, Booker T, Gene Okerland, Tony Schiavone, ex-Turner Sports President Dr. Harvey Schiller, Dusty Rhodes, Arn Anderson, Diamond Dallas Page, Shawn Michaels, Mick Foley, Sean Waltman, Jim Ross, Roddy Piper, Vince Russo, Triple H, Scott Hall, The Rock, Paul Heyman, Undertaker, Chris Jericho, Steve Austin & others along with archival interview clips from Eric Bischoff & and a 1998 interview with Ted Turner himself that I've never seen before.  While you can get these episodes on the WWE Network, the DVD bonus is that each episode contains a face to face interview by Rene Young with Triple H & Sting after each episode discussing the subject at hand.

Episode One: The War Begins - This episode gives an introduction to how both companies began their rise to a national expansion throughout the 80's & had a downturn in the early 90's before going into the changes made by WWE due the birth of ""Monday Night RAW"" & in WCW with Eric Bischoff becoming the new head of the company eventually leading to the debut of ""WCW Monday Nitro"" with Lex Luger himself speaking for the first time on a WWE program about the details of how his surprise debut on that episode was arranged followed by the discussion of different strategies taken by WCW to steal the audience away from RAW & how WWE's response to that backfired.

Episode Two: Rise Of The nWo - The title says it all as this episode focuses on the New World Order starting with the history of Scott Hall & Kevin Nash from their original unsuccessful beginnings in WCW to their rise as top names in WWE with details of the contracts offered by Eric Bischoff to return to WCW to do the ""outsiders"" storyline & the different reactions to it followed by the specific details of what went into Hulk Hogan becoming the third man & all the elements making the storyline gain so much attention & popularity including WWE's response that had a heavy negative reaction before going into the expansion of the group & how it started to work against the company but ultimately raised the bar for both promotions.

Episode Three: Embracing Attitude - This episode discussed the evolution into the ""Attitude Era"" starting by comparing the two company's presentations & their results before Steve Austin came along with the right character at the right time starting to push the envelope including the infamous gun incident with Brian Pillman leading WWE to go a crew direction with Vince himself making the public statement that they were ""opening the creative envelope"" going into the different elements such as the increased sexuality of certain characters to the women themselves getting higher profile roles & increased levels of violence along with fan interaction leading to WCW's response to that along with how they weren't able to compete with it with one talent stating it perfectly that ""The Attitude Era was American pop culture.""

Episode Four: A New D-Generation - ""Break it down"" as this episode discussed WWE's biggest faction during that time in DX starting off with the origins of both Shawn Michaels & Triple H eventually bringing their ""Kliq"" on screen together with Chyna & what their through processes were & what the difference was between their group & the nWo before going into the details of what happened when one member of the group made history on both shows followed by the discussion of things they did that raised the question of it they went too far with their antics & the interaction with Mike Tyson that eventually led to the relaunch of the group with the first high profile jump from WCW to their infamous invasion of Nitro & parody of The Nation to a reflection of the importance of the group.

Episode Five; Have A Nice Day - ""Ms. Foley's baby boy"" is discussed here starting with his early days in WCW & what set him apart from others to what he had to do to reinvent himself in ECW before going into the details of his character Mankind in WWE & how one interview completely changed the direction of his career followed by the discussion of his infamous Hell In A Cell & how the long term effects of that match changed his career leading into a discussion of the infamous night he won the WWE Championship with Tony Schavonie finally giving his side of the story & the famous ""This Is Your Life!"" segment with The Rock to a reflection on his career.

Episode Six: Hart Of War - Bret Hart is the focus of this episode starting off with the impact of had as the WWE Champion during the ""New Generation"" era & details of the bidding war between both promotions over him before going into the details of his professional rivalry with Shawn Michaels getting too personal & what issues Bret was having with the new ""attitude"" direction of WWE leading to a heavy discussion of the infamous ""Montreal Screwjob"" followed by talking about his WCW career as far as what went wrong with the creative direction from the very start & continued issues with not only the company but how Owen's death really effected him following the eventual end of his career & aftermath.

Episode Fifteen: Foundations Of War - This was a unique episode as it didn't just focus on one person but two people who have the same thing in common of being two long term stars who remained loyal & stayed with their companies during a period where so many talents were switching promotions for various reasons in WCW's Sting & WWE's Undertaker with elements of both men's characters being discussed from Undertaker being an untraditional character & Sting being a new age superhero to similar career acheivements such as their first World Championships before going into how both men remained ""company men"" with Sting constantly dealing with politics involving the bigger names coming into WCW while Undertaker was heavily depended on working through so many injuries followed by discussing the evolution of both mens characters with Sting becoming ""The Crow"" while Undertaker started showing more human qualities and how each man's continued evolution effected their careers including one that did more harm than good for one of them concluding on how both men remained loyal until the very end to the point where Sting was in the final match on the final WCW Nitro.
It should be noted that this was originally the fifteenth episode in the series but was moved over to this set replacing the ""War Goes Extreme"" episode which is on the next volume of this set.

Episode Eight: The Austin Era Has Begun - The superstar that WWE claims is the greatest of all time is discussed here from his early days in as ""Stunning"" & a ""Hollywood Blonde"" to the issues that he had leading to his eventual release from there to how his days in ECW were the beginning of his ""Stone Cold"" persona & what went wrong with him originally being brought in to WWE as ""The Ringmaster"" before going into the origins of becoming ""Stone Cold"" including how a freak accident allowed his character to evolve even more to the point where WCW had their own ""Austin"" before going into the build of him becoming WWE Champion & his feuds with Mr. McMahon & The Rock before concluding on how the side effects of his previous injury effected both companies & reflecting on his career.

Episode Nine: Flight Of The Crusierweights - This episode reflects on WCW's crusierweight division in how the company recruited not only different superstars from all over the world but the unique wrestling styles as well to the point where this was showcased in the very first match on ""Nitro"" to the point where they didn't need the same traditional elements to attract the audience to their feuds & matches leading to the reactivation of the Crusierweight Championship & how that was both a gift & a curse of those in the division before going into the expansion with more characters added to the roster including a funny story behind Rey Mysterio's debut & his classic match against Eddie Guerrero from Halloween Havoc leading to WWE's response to the division before going into the issues that caused frustration within the division to the point where talents showcased their point on the air or just left the company leading to the discussion of how the formula for the division was changed to the point where WCW couldn't recover concluding on successful life for the crusierweights after WCW including various World Champions.

Episode Ten: Who's Next - The story of WCW's biggest breakout star during this period of time was discussed next here in Bill Goldberg from his NFL career to how he got connected to WCW from training at the gym while discussing the various elements that were developed over time to build his character while hiding the negatives that came with his lack of his in-ring experience including what went wrong with a specific match he had against William Regal & the legitimacy of ""the streak"" to the point where WWE had a comedic response to it before going into details behind his World Championship victory from who's idea it was to the reasons behind why it was done the way it was followed by going into details of the decisions made in regards to Goldberg that caused him to lose his value to the company from how the streak ended & the aftermath that eventually drove fans away from WCW to what caused the fans to turn on him & how his own ego got in the way of business.

(Blu-Ray) WCW Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Big Bubba Rogers - This was the first main event of Nitro that went back & forth between both men with the bigger issue being the confrontation with ex-WWE superstar Lex Luger afterwords.
""WCW Nitro"" Sept. '95
[Best Of WCW Monday Nitro Vol. 1]

(Blu-Ray) No Disqualification Match: Mankind vs. WWE Champion The Rock - The Rock had The Corporation at ringside while Mankind was declared an ""honorary"" member of D-Generation X as they were in his corner for this match as both men started fighting on the outside with The Rock using the steps on Mankind's back before sandwiching his head between the steps & floor then slamming the other steps on his head. Both men made their way to the commentary table with both giving their ""play by play"" before Rock took advantage with the Rock Bottom through a table & using the ringbell as well. Rock continued to use whatever he could get his hands on such as the WWE Title only for Foley to counter & have it come back to bite The Rock as The Corporation would finally get involved resulting in the big brawl with DX with one more observer making his presence felt leading to a moment that was not only big in the career of Mick Foley but also WWE as Monday Night RAW would never get lower ratings than WCW Monday Nitro after this night.

[Best Of RAW: 15th Anniversary; Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses]

(Blu-Ray) Bill Goldberg vs. Hugh Morrus - This was the beginning of ""The Streak"" from the end result of the match, the impressive debut performance including showcasing his power against Hugh Morris who isn't a small man himself, and the mysterious aura surrounding him to not speaking to Gene Okerland afterwords & even ""Professor"" Mike Tenay having no information on Goldberg's past during commentary.
""WCW Nitro"" Sept. '97

Other Blu-Ray extras include the press conference of the announce of Nitro, promos/commercials leading to Nitro's debut episode, a feature on Montreal & if it was a conspiracy, and ""raw footage"" of DX's invasion of Nitro.

It's no secret that history is written by the winners & the way WWE has told the story of it's war with WCW in the past has been poor revisionist history (see the first ""Monday Night War"" DVD) but WWE did a good job in this series as they spend time on subjects that haven't been talked in as much depth before & were very fair in their discussion on each subject including criticism of their own product & acknowledging actions that weren't ""best for business"" in their favor.  The only criticism I have is to the presentation itself (ignoring the fact that this is another set in regards to WCW that has no representation of the company on the DVD cover) that WWE attempted to stretch this series out so they included episodes on certain people that came off as a reduced one hour version of previous documentaries & most of the Blu-Ray extras being easy throw away matches that have been released numerous times before or nothing special.  In the end though, I enjoyed the series on the network & the bonus of the face to face conversation on each subject by Sting & Triple H is a welcomed bonus so this would be a good one to add to the collection.",1435795200,7,13281,4.719275549805951

HE WAS A BIG FAN OF WCW MONDAY NITRO HE OWNS ALMOST EVERY DVD BLUE RAY HAVING TO DO WITH WCW. HE DID SAY HOWEVER THAT EVEN THOUGH THEIR IS ALOT OF WCW FOOTAGE... IT IS VERY ONE SIDED. IT TRYS TO MAKE WWE LOOK LIKE THE VICTIM. THAT THEY HAD TO GO AFTER WCW... WHAT IT COMES DOWN TOO IS THAT VINCE MCMAHON WAS JELOUS OF TED TURNER AND WCW BECAUSE TED TURNER HAD A BETTER PRODUCT SO VINCE MCMAHON DECIDED IF HE COULDNT BEAT TED TURNER HE WOULD JUST PUT HIM OUT OF THE BUISSNESS BY EXPLOITING SEX AND WOMEN BY USING WOMEN ON RAW TO APPEAL TO MEN TO GET THEM TO WATCH RAW INSTEAD OF NITRO. RAW REALLY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WRESTLING IT BECAME ABOUT SEX SELLS AND SINCE THEY COULDNT GET ANYONE TO WATCH RAW BACK IN 1995, 1996, 1997, ETC BECAUSE MONDAY NITRO WAS THE #1 WRESTLEING SHOW ON TELEVISION VINCE DECIDED THAT HE WOULD EXPLOIT WOMEN ON HIS SHOW TO GET THE RATINGS UP. SHOTS FIRED REALLY IS ONE SIDED PUT OUT WITH INTERVIEWS BY ALOT OF WWE'S EMPLOYEES OBVIOUSLY WORRIED ABOUT STAYING ON VINCES GOOD SIDE AND KEEPING THIER JOBS. THEY KEEP SAYING WWE HAD TO DO WHAT THEY HAD TO DO IT WAS THEIR JOBS, IT WAS THEIR LIVES ETC. WELL MY QUESTION TO WWE AND VINCE IS THIS... WHAT ABOUT WCW'S EMPLOYEES JOBS, AND THIER FAMILYS? THIS DOCUMENTARY REALLY SHOWS WHAT A SELFISH AND ARROGENT MAN AND COMPANY VINCE MCMAHON AND WWE IS AND ARE.... I AM A BELEIVER IN GOD THE FATHER AND HIS SON JESUS CHRIST AND IAM A CHRISTIAN.  VINCE MCMAHON IS GETTING HIS REWARDS HERE ON EARTH NOW... SOMEDAY HE WILL BE JUDGED AS WE ALL WIILL AND HE WILL HAVE TO ANSWER TO GOD THE FATHER FOR HIS SINS AND HIS EVILS THAT HE DID ON THIS EARTH TO WCW AND ALL THE MEN AND FAMILYS HE DESTROYED WHEN HE SET OUT TO DESTROY WCW BECAUSE OF HIS SELFISH AMBITIONS TO BE # 1 AND THE ONLY WRESTLING PROMOTER IN THIS WORLD.",1441238400,,1888,4.102702702702703
6860315,5,B00Q7SF0QI,"With this blu ray, you get the first 10 episodes of the WWE Network show w/post episode interviews featuring Sting and HHH. There are also a few matches and segments on the blu ray. Vol 2 comes on Sept 8 2015. The show does a great job covering the ratings war and is very entertaining. The post show interviews provide an inside look at what each episode covers and the extra's are pretty fun, too.",1440547200,,399,4.333333333333333
6860316,5,B00Q7SF0QI,"This DVD Set is one of The Best DVD's WWE has released in a long time run in 7 hours. I was a big fan of the Monday Night Wars and found it fascinating to hear more about it.

  One section of The DVD is Devoted To The NWO it really kickstarted The War as WCW starting that long winning streak over WWE and pushed WWE to give birth to WWE Attitude. Scott Hall and Kevin Nash really helped turn the tide in WCW. Hulk Hogan turning on WCW and being the leader of The NWO was perfect. I would have liked to hear WWE also mention one of the NWO's key rivals in the recently passed away 'Hot Rod' Roddy Piper. Piper vs Hogan was great in WCW and I tuned in to see that. Though Piper and The Hulkster were not in their prime the magic was still there and it was awesome. After each segment Triple H, Sting and Renee Young discuss the episode.

  One Section has to do with DX which was the counter to The NWO. What stuck out for me is I am not the biggest Triple H fan but when HBK retired he really took the ball and ran with it as the leader. The rivalry he had with The Rock was great resulting in Summerslam 98 one of the greatest Ladder Matches ever. X-Pac helped turn the tide back in WWE's favor. X-Pac was always a great wrestler and he had a nice comeback in WWE in 98 and nice run with The European Title he made the title mean more. The New Age Outlaws were one of the greatest and hottest tag teams of the 90s. It showed WWE knew what they were doing when they teamed those two up. HBK and HHH were the founding fathers of DX and they really got things started to be headed in the right direction. Though Shawn's career ended in 98 for the meantime he passed The Torch To Austin to help lead WWE forward in The War.

  One Segment was to do with Bret Hart. Bret Hart is one of the more depressing stories of The Monday Night War. His Match with Austin made Stone Cold the New Face of WWE. Bret Hart in WWE put on classic matches but Bret Hart clearly would never fit in with the WWE Attitude Era because he was old school and Vince let him go to WCW. The politics in WCW wasted Bret Hart. He could have had the ultimate big money match with Hulk Hogan that fans dreamed of but instead The Hulkster made sure that match never happened. Nash and Hall never wanted to work with Bret. It was probably jealousy. Flair put Hart over to his credit. Macho Man has a good brief feud with Bret. Bret faced Sting and Lex Luger. Bret's character would turn from face to heel back and forth as WCW seemed to be obviously not sure of what they wanted to do with Bret. As a big fan of Bret's I enjoyed his time in WCW I don't think he was ever given a chance to make a difference there and I think people were jealous of him and wanted to see him fail. I still thought he did a great job in WCW with his matches with DDP, Piper, Luger, Henning, Savage, Flair and Goldberg.

  Another Section was Goldberg. This was another sad tale of politics helped kill the hottest thing WCW had. Nash and The Hulkster instead of letting Goldberg continue to ride his momentum with WCW as Champion had his streak killed off. It was an awesome period though with Goldberg. He beat Hogan on The Greatest Nitro ever. Goldberg went through almost every wrestler on the roster until Scott Hall used the taser to assist Nash in cooling Goldberg's jets with a big loss. I did think Goldberg came back strong after the loss from 99-01. Why WCW never gave him another title run remains a mystery. Goldberg was The Face of WCW. It would be better to make him the champ than David Arquete, Jeff Jarrett or Vince Russo. The Heel Goldberg idea I thought was a good one but Goldberg's heart wasn't in it so they scrapped it. But I remember liking Goldberg as The Heel fighting Nash who was the Face at WCW Bash At The Beach 2000 this was when WWE was burying WCW in the ratings. Goldberg was The Franchise I think towards the end 2000-2001 one of the key mistakes was not putting the belt back on Goldberg. It was too bad Goldberg injured Bret Hart and ended his career. I think it was just an accident. Goldberg had a great career in WCW and will be remembered as one of the greatest stars of Pro Wrestling and The Monday Night War.

  One Segment is Devoted to Austin. Stone Cold single handly saved WWE from going out of business. He was the one that shifted the ratings in WWE's ratings. Stone Cold and Vince worked great together with the right chemistry. The Rock came into his own having the greatest rivalry in Wrestling. Stone Cold had countless kick ass matches on RAW and by far the most memorable moments were with him. He deserves a lot of credit he was the leader and The WWE lockeroom followed his lead. Stone Cold is the greatest star in the history of wrestling in my opinion. I hope one day there will be another wrestling star like him but there will always only be one Stone Cold.

  There are other sections I will not go into in detail Mick Foley, Embracing Attitude Era, Cruiser weights,  Foundations of War.

  It was cool to have both Triple H and Sting talk after the episodes. It was good to get their thoughts. Overall this was a awesome dvd and a must for any wrestling fan or fan of wrestling in the 90s. I hope a lot more dvds on The Monday War are released. I see they already have a part 2 coming out in the future. Cheers and Enjoy!",1440115200,3,5329,4.173489278752436

6860318,1,B00Q7SF0QI,"I don't why WWE insists on having all these people who weren't involved or even wrestling at the time giving commentary. I hate The Miz-take and he thinks he's funny but he's just stupid. Jon Cena, Daniel Bryan, CM Punk and the list goes on. They did the same thing on OMG! and greatest rivalries. I had never seen Ted Turner talk about WCW on camera so that was kind of interesting as opposed that egomaniac Vince McMahon has to put himself and his family in every storyline. I liked HHH as a wrestler but I wished they had picked somebody more objective. He's married to Stephanie and Vince is his father in law. They re-use so many interviews and sound bytes from other chapters of this documentary. They always have to end every segment gloating about how WWE won and WCW lost.. The real losers are the fans because without competition WWE has gotten lame. Volume 2 will probably be more of the same only they will have Vince Russo making excuses for all his dumb decisions that helped kill WCW. I wouldn't buy anything that has that smug arrogant conceited loudmouthed Rock on the cover. One of his stupid catchphrases was know your role and shut your mouth but he never shut his mouth.",1439251200,4,1191,4.518518518518518

8690771,4,B00Q7SF0QI,"I enjoyed this documentary. It's certainly a WWE product, as it's fairly one-sided, but that's to be expected. Given that it's episodic and not one long documentary, they tend to cover topics multiple times to some extent, but that's a minor gripe. Some of the episodes I found kind of pointless, like the female wrestlers and Jericho. You could probably thin it out to 15 episodes and be fine, but they wanted to stretch it out to 20.",1495756800,,435,4.589743589743589
