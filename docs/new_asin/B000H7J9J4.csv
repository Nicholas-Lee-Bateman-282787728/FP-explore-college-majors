8137459,4,B000H7J9J4,"The Relentless series seems to be in my opinion, a very well made series of ""To catch a Killer""-type films. After watching the first movie and then watching the second one, I decided it was time to view the third one, as well as the fourth one. And thanks to the good people over at Image Entertainment, we get both movies on 1 DVD.

In part 3, Det. Sam Dietz (Once again, played by Leo Rossi, who this time around, gets top billing as well as even serving as one of this film's and part 4's producers) has returned from up north to the City of Angels, after being away for sometime. He is now divorced from Carol. This time around, Dietz agrees to track yet another serial killer. The killer in this one, played by William Forsythe, finds various women and hacks them up and taunts the police by sending them the body parts. The killer is also someone Sam's arrested before. 7/10

In part 4, which is the better film, in my opinion, Sam is after yet another killer who kills women, based on their connection to therapist Dr. Sara Lee Jaffe (Played by Famke Janssen, in one of her first roles) in ritualistic-style murders. Sara herself holds the key to the case. Meanwhile, Dietz has other problems of his own, such as his teenage son Corey (Now being played by the late Christopher Pettiet), who's role in this seems to be somewhat bigger than part 1 or 2 and especially 3 combined (Watch 3 to know why). Also interesting to note that Ken Lerner, Michael Lerner's brother, who also appeared in part 1, plays a totally different character, a joke-loving coroner. 8.5/10

In closing, I believe 4 to be the superior film, mainly because of the intense ending, which I will not say how it goes. Both films I recommend. I hope Cinetel Films decides to make a Relentless 5 soon, although it may never happen, we may just end up with some lame remake of the first movie, but one can dream.

EXTRAS: None, except for a good 1:85 widescreen presentation for both films.",1243555200,3,1962,4.472067039106145
