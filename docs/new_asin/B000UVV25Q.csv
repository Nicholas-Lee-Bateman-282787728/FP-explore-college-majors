2925722,3,B000UVV25Q,"Since the days of bargain-bin videotapes by labels like Goodtimes, I've always been wary of these ""too good to be true"" deals.  Yet, as I am quite a fan of the films of Alfred Hitchcock, I couldn't pass this one up.  And for the most part, I'm glad I gambled a few bucks.

As of this writing, the majority of these films are still in the public domain and thus, not available from companies willing to spend the time and money on a proper restoration.  It's worth noting, though, that some of the best films here ARE available in near-pristine condition in the 3-disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Alfred-Hitchcock-Box-Set-The-Ring-The-Manxman-Murder-The-Skin-Game-Rich-and-Strange/dp/B000KJU12S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Alfred Hitchcock Box Set (The Ring / The Manxman / Murder! / The Skin Game / Rich and Strange)</a>.

For those who don't want to shell out the considerable bucks for all those, or if you're a completist (like me) who feels the need to possess EVERY film the man made, this is a good set to own.

Audio/Video quality varies among the films, but I'd consider them all watchable.  Since early sound classics like SECRET AGENT and RICH AND STRANGE aren't available in better condition elsewhere, I found the transfers here to be reasonably good.  Hitch's best silent film, THE LODGER, unfortunately suffers some serious contrast issues.

The real highlight of this set, however, is nearly an hour's worth of Hitchcock movie trailers.  Oddly enough, none of the films contained in the set is represented with a trailer.  But they cover much of the Master's career from 1940 thru the late 60's.  And the quality on the trailers is far superior to that of the films.

Bottom line: For all but the most discriminating viewer, this is a worthwhile purchase.  Just don't expect the quality you'd get from the major companies.",1201824000,204,2597,6.664688427299703
2925723,4,B000UVV25Q,"ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS - THE LEGEND BEGINS consists primarily of silent and sound films that Hitchcock directed before relocating from Britain to Hollywood in 1940. One feature that distingushes this collection from several similar budget-priced multi-packs is the near-hour's worth of movie trailers included as a bonus. There's also a couple of episodes from the murder/mystery anthology TV show that Hitchcock hosted a half century ago.

MILL CREEK box sets offer good-to-average-quality audio and video transfers of public domain material at a most reasonable price. Since their switch over from RAINTREE, the company ID appears for brief intervals in the lower right hand corner of the screen.

2925725,3,B000UVV25Q,"This was received as a gift a few years back, but I just got around to looking at these movies; I was inspired to do so by a book I'm currently reading about Hitchcock's relationships with his female actresses (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spellbound-by-Beauty-Alfred-Hitchcock-and-His-Leading-Ladies/dp/0307351319/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladies</a>) by Donald Spoto, the first few chapters of which deal with Hitchcock's creative output in the 1920s and early 30s, which this DVD set covers. Some of these pictures, like THE LADY VANISHES, SABOTAGE and THE THIRTY-NINE STEPS are 4 and 5-star movies, but they are not restored in any way, and because of this, I can't rate this set any higher than 3 stars. It wouldn't even rate that highly was it not for the fact that this is a very inexpensive product containing 18 full length movies (and two ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS TV episodes) on 4 discs, so it would be unfair to trash it entirely. I am not going to review any of these films in any detail, but in the interest of informing potential buyers, what follows is a list of the films and their quality, technically speaking.  NOT using Amazon's 5-star system, both print quality and sound will be rated 4 stars to 1 as follows: **** - fair (okay) / *** - poor (but acceptable) / ** - bad (but still watchable) / * - dreadful (difficult to watch and/or hear). Note that all the movies have a soundtrack, even the silent ones; there are notes provided to clarify my ratings on some of these movies; silent movies are indicated, and all are black & white:

1-1 - THE LADY VANISHES (1938) - print **** / sound ****  note:  this is one of Hitchcock's best early films; there are better quality prints available.
1-2 - THE FARMER'S WIFE (1928; silent) - print *** / music *** (clear but scratchy)
1-3 - THE MANXMAN (1926; silent) - print ** (image scan is off-center) / music ***
1-4 - THE CHANEY VASE (from Alfred Hitchcock Presents 1955 - 1962) - print ** / sound ***
1-5 - THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE (from Alfred Hitchcock Presents 1955 - 1962) - print ** / sound ***
2-1 - RICH AND STRANGE (1932) - print ** / sound ***
2-2 - THE THIRTY-NINE STEPS (1935) - print *** / sound ***  note:  another early masterpiece, there are better quality prints available
2-3 - SECRET AGENT (1936) - print ** / sound ***  note:  good movie, but poor print makes it hard to watch
2-4 - CHAMPAGNE (1928; silent) - print ** / music **** (obviously a more contemporary soundtrack, as it is in stereo!)
2-5 - BLACKMAIL (1929) - print *** / sound *** (clear sound, but with some static)
3-1 - EASY VIRTUE (1926; silent) - print ** (jumpy) / music ***
3-2 - JAMAICA INN (1939) - print *** / sound ** (clear sound, but constant buzz in background)  note:  atmospheric photography, entertaining plot
3-3 - THE LODGER (1926; silent) - print * / music ** (muddy sound)  note:  this is a good silent film that deserves a quality restoration; this print is nearly unwatchable - dark, jumpy and blurry, with title cards that are difficult to read due to poor contrast.
3-4 - THE RING (1927; silent) - print * / music **
3-5 - YOUNG AND INNOCENT (1937) - print *** / sound ***
4-1 - JUNO AND THE PAYCOCK (1930) - print ** / sound ** (sound acceptable, but marred by static)  note:  this is basically a filmed stage play by Sean O'Casey and probably the worst and most atypical of the movies in this collection; according to Donald Spoto, Hitchcock did not want to do this film, but was pressured into it by British International Pictures. The play is not bad, but visually, it makes for a dull movie.
4-2 - SABOTAGE (1936) - print ** / sound ***  note:  another excellent early Hitchcock thriller of which there are surely better prints
4-3 - THE SKIN GAME (1931) - print ** / sound ** (clear sound but scratchy background noise)
4-4 - NUMBER SEVENTEEN (1932) - print ** / sound * (annoying buzz in background)
4-5 - THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (1934) - print ** / sound ***  note:  some critics consider this first version better than Hitchcock's 1956 color remake, but I'm one who's not in agreement -- however, this black and white movie is another that is worth a quality restoration.  This print does not do it justice at all.

Fun Bonus Feature:  55 minutes of Hitchcock movie trailers spanning much of his career; quality varies.

In conclusion, this is an affordable DVD set that I can recommend to those who are merely curious about Hitchcock's early development as a director, and don't want to spend a lot of money, but those serious collectors or Hitchcock scholars who desire better quality viewing will be happier with some of the other product available; definitely read the reviews of other DVD or Blu-Ray releases before buying!",1486771200,4,4812,4.6698224852071

My set only cost $5 at wallmart so keeping the two good discs was better than nothing, but reading other reviews shows others had the same problem with flawed discs. On the two discs that were damaged, they started Ok but then near the end of the movies the defects kicked in so you wasted half the movie getting interested only to never see the end...except in bits and stops and jumps. then just started into the second movie and I don't know how the first movie ended. you might get lucky and get four good discs or you might get unlucky and get four you can't play...even buying two sets is no guarantee.

2925770,4,B000UVV25Q,"Alfred Hitchcock: The Legend Begins

These twenty movies have a few silent films from the 1920s. Some are found on other collections (such as those 50 pack collections). All are in monochrome. Silent movies (#) were made before 1929, the newer ones also have higher quality. Disc 1 has two 25 minute episodes from his 1950's TV show. Some of these older movies have a loss of video quality; they have an organic base that ages. Hitchcock could scare an audience but reassure them it would turn out alright.

The 39 Steps came from a famous novel by John Buchan (who had an interesting career). It pointed out that Britain was no longer isolated from the Continent. The plot was used a number of times (innocent man pursued by both the police and the criminals). One was called North by Northwest. The Man Who Knew Too Much was also reproduced. The last version (not by Hitchcock) was called Foul Play. Sabotage came from a novel by Joseph Conrad, The Secret Agent. Europe then was threatened by terrorists bombs, much like today. The Secret Agent came from the novel Ashenden by Somerset Maugham.

2925781,4,B000UVV25Q,"I bought this set two years ago.  These are Hitchcock's earliest movies from the early stages of his career.  Some of the movies in this set are silent films (six of them), but so many of them are good.  Besides, I like silent films to begin with.  Here are the movies included in this set:

Bonus Features: 55 minutes of Hitchcock trailers spanning his career.

The picture quality isn't exactly great because each of the four DVDs has 5 movies crammed onto them, so picture quality suffers a bit.  However, these movies are more than watchable, especially if you're not fussy about picture and sound quality, especially when it comes to old movies.

I recommend this set for those of you who want to see some of Hitchcock's early work.",1385164800,2,1396,4.906382978723404

2925784,4,B000UVV25Q,"This is a great collection.  I was not thrilled with a couple of the movies that were silent films, but take the good with the bad.  Hitchcock is a master and his films are all worth owning.  Buy them before they are no longer available.",1377820800,,237,4.222222222222222
2925785,4,B000UVV25Q,"""Alfred Hitchcock: The Legend Begins"" is a true must have for anyone who is a fan of the Master of Suspense. Most fans are well aware of Hitchcock's career as a director when he came to the United States in the 1940's. The movies he directed during that time is an endless line of classics including films like ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"", ""North By Northwest"", ""To Catch A Thief"" along with his later thrillers like ""Psycho"" and ""The Birds"". But ""The Legend Begins"" looks at Hitchcock's career while he was still making films in England. So these are some of the very first films Hitchcock made and this collection does include some of his silent films. Many people forget that Hitchcock's career as a director started in the silent era. It was during the silent era that Alfred would make ""The Lodger"", considered the first film he made that would be classified as a suspense movie which Hitchcock would become well known for making throughout his career.

Among the other early classics that is in this collection include ""The Manxman"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (the original version Hitch made in 1934), ""The Lady Vanishes"" and ""The 39 Steps"". These films along with the rest in this collection show the early genius inside the mind of Hitchcock that would continue to grow and expand over the decades. Not all of the movies in this collection would be considered a masterpiece but they still show the master at work.

If there is a downside to ""The Legend Begins"" it would be some of the films could use some re-mastering. The quality for some of these films are a little fuzzy or grainy. Still don't let that stop you from getting this collection. These are great films to watch no matter the condition. Besides where else can you get 20 movies (well actually 18 movies and 2 episodes from the TV series ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"") for such a ridiculously cheap price! It is a great deal you can't go wrong with.",1377129600,2,1919,4.657817109144543

2925799,5,B000UVV25Q,"This is a fine way for any Hitchcock fan to sample some of the Master's early film work (from the 1920's), including some silent films and a couple later shows from his famous television series (from the 1950's) thrown in. The early films may seem a little static for today's audiences and some of the choices, while definitely not 'classics', may be a little difficult to sit through.  Filming styles, acting styles, production styles and the budgets alloted to films, have changed, however, there are enough 'goodies' here to make it worth your while and you can watch the early beginnings of Hitchcock's technique taking its rudimentary shape. 'The Thirty Nine Steps', 'The Lady Vanishes' and 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' (not the later color version with Doris Day) are all fairly well established classics and these alone make this very reasonably priced set worth your while.  The prints and the sound vary in quality ... none of them are up to today's standards ... but that's to be expected, since some of these films are fast approaching the one hundred year mark.  Both for fans of Hitchcock and students of early British film making, this is a pretty good way to get both at a bargain.",1354579200,3,1195,4.735576923076923
2925800,5,B000UVV25Q,"With a bit of trepidation, I ordered this set, but figured if it was a total loss it was worth a try for 5 dollars.

Get yourself a multi-region DVD player, one that advertises that it can play scratched DVDs too, and you should have no problem with these DVDs.

The DVDs in this set are flawless, I had no problem whatsoever playing these DVDs and it's a delight to see the old movies in their original state and get a peek into Hitchcock's early development as a filmmaker. Only one caveat, these movies  are in their original state and are not remastered, restored or in high definition. The films have slight amounts of snow and hiccups but for me this adds to their charm.",1343779200,4,677,4.4
2925801,4,B000UVV25Q,"So, let's be clear: yes the quality isn't that great video or sound wise. Compare them to a remastered version and you'll be disappointed. I have the 39 steps and the man who knew too much remastered. I wasn't altogether that disappointed with the image and sound. You can tell the difference; but you don't return to this set shocked at how unwatchable it is. However, the price and the number of films you get makes this set worth having.

21 of Hitchcock's films (okay, 2 are TV episodes) for less than 10. That isn't bad at all. I got this collection to finish off my own personal collection with his earlier works. Far cheaper than buying all 19 as remastered DVDs. I suspect I'd not watch some again, but only to say that I seen all his films. This made the set appealing to me.

Before buying I was a bit nervous as I read some reviews about the qaulity and that some discs don't work. I've had no problem with faulty discs. Also, sure the sound crackles and hisses and the pictures look like a snow storm in places, but truly, it isn't unbearable or unwatchable!

Sure, if you want to fork out a lot for each film remastered then do that. However, if you want perfectly watchable Hitchcock films, as people would have viewed them when released, then this set might just be for you.

I'd say buy this to get his early works in bulk. Then if you like any enough to want to watch again and again, and you find the quality not up to your standards, then fork out some more on the individual ones in the future. However, I suspect the average person will return to this set again and again for their fill of early Hitchcock.",1343347200,,1627,4.342105263157895

2925803,5,B000UVV25Q,"This is a delightful set of films in Hitchcock's early years. It has his big breakout movies as well as a few others in this gold mine of a set.

Most of these, I had never seen before, and many I had never even heard of before I bought the set, I'm ashamed to say. I was thrilled though as I watched them and was able to see how Hitchcock's brilliant craft evolved right before my eyes, not just in suspense but also his tinkering in cinematography.

His beginnings were small, but amazingly well done even then. There are a few silents and though these were his very early days, they are still near perfection. The Lodger had me sitting on the edge of my seat and this was a silent! As a forty-something-year-old I was not accustomed to silent films, yet these had me. You can feel how Hitchcock was drawn to suspense, even as a new director.

Rich and Strange is another great for a completely different reason. Here is his (obvious) cinematography experiments. Pay special attention to the scene on board the ship at night in the moonlight. You'll see how he films Emily (Joan Barry) vs the others. He makes her look soft and elegant. It's really very interesting. Also the dry humored irony in the lesson-to-be-learned ending is obviously so very Hitch. Evidently he never changed. I think he must've been born that way!

He has a few A-List films here as well, being Sabotage, Secret Agent, The Thiry-Nine Steps and The Lady Vanishes. There is no doubt about it. The quality of the actual film is lacking. Many are faded and the sound is quite tinny, but that does not make a movie any less fabulous. They are still great films and this is not Hitchcock's fault. In any case, it's better to see it this way than never at all, because without it you are truly missing out on the real Hitch.

If I had to make a complaint, it would be the order in which the films were put on the DVDs. It's as though they drew them from a hat. Were I to do it, I would have put them in chronological order. My guess is that those who buy this are Hitchcock fans and will want to view them as I have; to see his talent grow. I do recommend doing it that way. Yes, it is skipping around - from DVD to DVD - but I think you'll be pleased to see how it progresses.

One further word of caution. I do wonder why Hitchock made Jamaica Inn. It doesn't fall into any of his genres that he did throughout his life. It has the great Maureen O'Hara, but even she does little for the film. I do have to say, that if anything he ever did was bad, this would be it. For certain. Yes, really. In any case, for this reason it is an interesting inclusion into the set. It lets us see that he did have a weak spot after all, he was not infallible (close, but not 100%), and makes us appreciate his true niche all the more, that being suspense. After all, he is not known as the 'Master of Suspense' for nothing.

In fact, this whole set seems (to me) to sound like Darth Vader, ""...I was but the learner, now I am the Master...""",1334188800,3,2998,4.230769230769231

Most of the movies included in this set are hitchcock's early films, which are films I'm not familiar with.

2925808,3,B000UVV25Q,"When I first opened the package I popped the DVDs into my computer I was pretty taken aback by the overly compressed video and treble heavy, scratchy audio. I went through all fours discs and was prepared to open up amazon and give it a one star scathing review. I had bought the package for The 39 Steps and wanted to watch that first though. I had seen a restored version on TCM years ago and expected to get something similar to that. I thought maybe I could make a bit of an improvement with some modifications, so I opened the DVD in a program called VLC. I used a deinterlacing mode called Yadif(2x) and the result was amazing. Well maybe amazing is too strong of a word, but it seemed to stop all the digital block artifacts during motion and without any discern-able loss is detail. It seems like a contradiction but it made everything both smoother and crisper. As for the sound I used the VLC equalizer to cut off some of the treble response but I couldn't do anything about all the scratchy noises. The next day I watched The Man Who New Too Much on the SDTV in the basement and as expected the visual quality was okay. So to conclude, watch it on an old SDTV or with filters on a computer. Totally unwatchable on a large screen HDTV with surround sound.",1324771200,,1265,4.341772151898734
2925809,1,B000UVV25Q,"To many casual film-watchers, Hitchcock is known for his late masterworks like Vertigo, Psycho, The Birds, and so on. But film buffs know Hitch was crafting wonderful movies back in the 30's, and indeed was directing during the silent era.

This set contains some early gems, like The 39 Steps, which adumbrates many ideas and themes for which Hitchcock later became so famous. Secret Agent offers up sparkling dialogue and a memorably bizarre turn by Peter Lorre. The atmospheric Jamaica Inn introduced us to the striking Maureen O'Hara. The Lady Vanishes is one of Hitchcock's most consistently delightful films, perfectly blending comedy, romance, mystery, and suspense, and it features one of his most charming romantic duos, Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave.

So, some of these films are very much worth your time. My one star is not for them, but for the transfers. These are some pitiful presentations of great art. It's shocking how bad The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes look and sound compared to the restored Criterion editions. Others suffer from equally severe video and audio problems, and not just the typical flaws you'd expect of early films that have not been preserved/restored properly: severe digital compression artifacts badly mar many images, presumably the result of trying to squeeze so many films onto each disc. Jamaica Inn is missing whole scenes, which is simply inexcusable.",1323129600,6,1411,5.184210526315789
2925810,5,B000UVV25Q,"I love Alfred Hitchcock and was very happy to have 20 of the movies! however, i feel that some of the movies are of poor quality, like they were filmed and never edited. But over all for the price, very good deal!",1318982400,,213,4.095238095238095
2925811,1,B000UVV25Q,"These are absolutely not worth watching on anything larger than an 8"" portable DVD player. To fit so many movies on a few DVDs, they compressed the video data down dramatically. On a large screen, the video is flooded with artifacts, rendering the picture blocky and filled with noise. Plus the transfers themselves still retain the original film noise - these have not been professionally cleaned like the Criterion Collection releases. Save your $5 at Walmart, and instead buy The Lady Vanishes (Criterion edition) on eBay or Half.com for $5 - then you'll be getting your money's worth.",1318464000,5,588,5.010204081632653
2925812,5,B000UVV25Q,"A lot of people are complaining about the quality of the movies, but it's Mill Creek Entertainment! Of course it's going to be low-quality. And some people are going on about how the transfer is so bad, but that's what movies look like when they've been sitting in a vault for about 80 years. It's not Mill Creek Entertainment's fault. Anyway, I think this is an abssolutely amazing deal. 18 movie and 2 episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents sounds pretty awesome to me? The packaging is pretty simple. You open the large DVD case, and you get 4 paper sleeves all on top of each other, with the discs in them. This collection obviously doesn't come with his best-known movies (Rear Window, Vertigo, Psycho), but it does come with some earlier classics (The Lady Vanishes, The 39 Steps, The Lodger), and it IS called ""The Legend Begins"", so it only comes with his 20s-30s Gaumont British stuff, dating from 1927 to 1939, and they're all pretty good.

Disc 1:

  The Lady Vanishes (1938)- I think this film is my favorite, and it's one of Hitch's early classics. A girl (Margaret Lockwood) is taking a transcontinental train trip to marry her boyfriend and suddenly an old lady she meets suddenly vanishes, and she starts to look for her. It has great suspense, a nice ending, and it also takes place on a train, a place he makes suspenseful (Strangers on a Train, North by Northwest, The 39 Steps, etc.) It also has great acting, too. It starts off the films wonderfully!

  The Farmers Wife (1928)- One of Hitch's first films and a pretty good one, too. This is one of the silent films. A farmer (Jameson Thomas) who recently lost his wife and goes out to find different female acquaintences to fall in love with, but doesn't realize that his housekeeper, Minta (Lillian-Hall Davis) loves him. The film is supposed to be 98 minutes, but since they slowed the film down, it's now 129 minutes, so it does feel a bit draggy, but altogether, it's a cute film with nice music, romance, and a good story.

  The Manxman (1929)- This is another silent film, and Hitch's last silent film. I think it's his most romantic film from the 20s, and it has a beautiful setting and acting, especially from Anny Ondra (she's great). It's about two friends, Pete (Carl Brisson), and Philip (Malcolm Keen), who both love a woman named Kate (Anny Ondra). Pete ultimately falls in love with her, but suddenly she gets a letter that Pete is dead, so she falls for Philip, but it turns out Pete is alive, so this is a ""love traingle"" films, and it's very dramatic. Altogether, this isn't in my top 5, but it's pretty amazing.

  Alfred Hitchcock Presents: The Cheney Vase- I really love this episode. It's about a man who keeps an old woman hostage in her home because she has a vase that he wants to sell, but she won't let him. It isn't very suspenseful, but it's very sharp and entertaining. It's worth seeing.

  Alfred Hitchcock Presents: The Sorcerer's Apprentice- The only Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode that got banned from television becuase it was ""too morbid"" to air. It's about a mentally challenged boy who joins a circus, and it all ends with him cutting someone in half, during a trick. Of course, you could see why it was controversial, but none the less, a good episode.

Disc 2:

  Rich and Strange (1931)- This is another one of my favorites. It's about a couple (Henry Kendall and Joan Barry), who are struggling with their marriage and money, when one day, they recieve a fortune from an uncle, so they spend it on a cruise, and they both fall in love with different people, and complicate their marriage even more. It's a very good film, with an actually suspenseful ending, even though it's a romance. Instead of a train, it takes place on a cruise ship, and even though it was a flop when it came out in 1931, it still is an amazing film.

  The 39 Steps (1935)- This is an early Hitch classic, and it's very brilliant. It's about a Canadian (Robert Donat) vacationing in Britain, when he meets a woman who tells him about something called ""the 39 steps"", but doesn't reveal much. The next morning, he finds her stabbed in the back. Suddenly, he's accused of murder and flees across town to town, and meets another woman who he falls in love with (Madeleine Carroll). This film is, as according to the British Film Institute, the fourth best British film of all time, and it deserves it. It's a very suspenseful ""wrong man accused"" film that Hitch did multiple times (North by Northwest, The Wrong Man, Frenzy, etc.), and it keeps you guessing what ""the 39 steps"" actually is until the very end.

  Secret Agent (1936)- I think this is a standout film and it's a very good Hitchcock film. John Gielgud plays a British officer, a famous writer whose death is faked during World War I, and who is sent by someone named ""R"", head of British intelligence, to Switzerland on a secret mission. Madeleine Carroll (The 39 Steps), plays an agent who poses as his wife. Peter Lorre plays an agent working with them. It's a suspenseful film, with an exciting train-ride ending scene, and while it's not best known of his early films, I still think it's brilliant.

  Champagne (1928)- This film was a huge flop and even Hitchcock, in the legendary Hitchcock/Truffaut interview, said the film was dissapointing and that ""it had no story to tell"", but I still loved it. I thought it was great. Betty Balfour plays a girl who spends all of her father's money. Her father is a Wall Street Journalist. The stock market crashes and now she needs to work to make some money. It's a nice little silent drama that I wouldn't mind seeing again.

  Blackmail (1929)- Hitchcock's first sound film, and it's wonderful! It stars Anny Ondra, one of my favorite silent film actresses, with Joan Barry dubbed over her heavy Czech accented voice, as Hitchcock thought her accent was too strong. It's definitely one of my favorites. The film is about a woman, with a Scotland Yard Detective boyfriend. When she almost gets raped by another man, she stabs him with a bread knife (none of it showed on screen), and she won't tell anyone what she did, even when someone else gets accused of the crime. It's definitely in the top 5 and it a fast paced suspense movie, with Hitchcock's longest cameo, where he's getting pestered by a little boy on a train.

Disc 3:

  Easy Virtue (1928)- This film isn't my favorite, but it's still a very good silent romance film. A woman named Larita Filton (Isabel Jeans) is married to a drunken man, and once he finds her being seduced by the painter that's painting a portrait of her, they file for divorce. She later becomes a woman of ""easy virtue"". She moves to the French Riviera, and falls in love/marries a man named John (Robin Irving), although his family, mainly the mother, strongly disapproves of her. I actually really liked this film. It has romance, drama, good acting, and a great Hitchcock cameo. He can be seen about 21 minutes into the movie in a tennis court.

  Jamaica Inn (1939)- I didn't really love Jamaica Inn as much as all the others, but it still was a pretty good film. Jamaica Inn is headquarters to a gang of shipwreckers and smugglers, and woman named Mary (Maureen O'Hara) comes to live at the inn, saves the life of Traherne (Robert Newton), and they escape Jamaica Inn and try to stop a shipwreck, and they end up falling in love. This film isn't the most entertaining, but I guess it wasn't that bad at all. It's just definitely not as good as films like The Lady Vanishes and Blackmail.

  The Lodger: The Story of the London Fog (1927)- Some say this was Hitchcock's ""first actual Hitchcock film"". It was his third film and his first suspense. A Jack the Ripper type serial killer named ""The Avenger"" is murdering young blonde woman every Tuesday night. A woman, Daisy (June), who is a model, lives with her parents in a lodging house and suddenly a lodger (Ivor Novello) arrives at the house, and they all suspect that he is the killer. I'd have to say this film has the worst video quality. It is the oldest film on here, anyway. This is another one in my top 5, because it's very creepy, suspenseful, has Hitchcock's first cameo, and even has a bit of romance in here. It's a wonderful silent film.

  The Ring (1927)- This is another love triangle silent film. It's about a boxer (Carl Brisson) who marries Mabel (Lillian-Hall Davis), but she falls for another boxer, and the whole thing becomes complicated. I think this was Hitchcock's only film to use the ""n"" word. It has a nice climax and is actually a pretty good film. It's not wonderful, but it's very good.

  Young and Innocent (1937)- A woman named Christine dies, and her boyfriend Robert (Derrick De Marney) gets accused of the murder. Suddenly, he is on the run with a girl named Erica (Nova Pilbeam). It's another ""wrong man accused"" Hitchcock film and it's very suspenseful with a wild climax and great acting.

Disc 4:

  Juno and the Paycock (1930)- I think that everyone agrees this is Hitchcock's worst film. Not that's it very bad, it's just that it drags on way too long, and it's just boring. I'm not saying it's horrible. It's alright, but I wouldn't see it again. It's about a struggling Irish family who lives in tenemant housing. It has an unresolved ending and it's pretty bland, but then again it's not absolutely awful.

  Sabotage (1936)- ""Sabotage"" is definitely one of my favorites! It's pretty short (1 hour, 15 minutes), but it's fast-paced and is suspenseful. It's about a woman, Mrs. Verloc (Sylvia Sidney), who is married to a man who is part of a European terrorist gang, Karl Verloc (Oscar Homolka). A detective sergeant, Ted Spencer (John Loder) goes undercover to investigate Verloc, and befriends his wife, and her little brother, Stevie (Desmond Tester). This film has a scene that is ""ahead of it's time"" that has to do with an explosion, and for anyone who hasn't seen it, I won't give it away. ""Sabotage"" has suspense, drama, a Walt Disney animation, and Sylvia Sidney! Altogether, it's an amazing film.

  The Skin Game (1931)- This film tells the story of a feud between an upper-class family, The Hillcrists, and the formerly-working class, The Hornblowers. It's actually pretty good. It has great acting, dialouge, and a nice story, based on a play. It's a good movie.

  Number 17 (1932)- Hitchcock called this film ""a disaster"", and while I like the film, I could see why he said that. The movie is only 1 hour and 4 minutes, and doesn't go anywhere very special, but it srtill has a suspenseful plot. It's about a detective (John Stuart) searching for jewel thieves in an old, abandoned house and suddenly many people get mixed up into it when they all arrive at the house. It's not Hitchcock's best from the 30's, but I like it.

  The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934)- Even though I prefer the 1956 Technicolor version with Jimmy Stewaart and Doris Day, this 1934 original is still good. It's about a couple (Leslie Banks and Edna Best), and their daughter (a young Nova Pilbeam) vacationing in Switzerland and when they witness the murder of a French spy. Suddenly, they get mixed up in an assasination plot and their daughter gets taken away from them. My favorite part is the climax at the Royal Albert Hall. It also has great acting from Peter Lorre. Both versions of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" are amazing.

My favorite thing in the whole entire package is the 19 Hitchcock trailers. It's about 55 minutes and come swith the following trailers:

1. Foreign Correspondent
2. Strangers on a Train
3. I Confess
4. Dial 'M' for Murder
5. North by Northwest
6. To Catch a Thief
7. Torn Curtain
8. Marnie
9. Rebecca
10. Spellbound
11. Topaz
12. The Trouble With Harry
13. Saboteur
14. The Birds
15. Vertigo
16. Rope
17. The Man Who Knew Too Much
18. Rear Window
19. Psycho

Altogether, this is an amazing Alfred Hitchcock package with suspenseful, funny, and romantic films. It's DEFINITELY worth buying for 5 dollars!

1. The Lady Vanishes
2. Sabotage
3. The Farmer's Wife",1315440000,12,12046,4.623474178403756

I was shocked to see that a whole reel of JAMAICA INN is simply missing, and a crucial scene of the hero, who is tied to a chair, is, in the next scene free and walking about.

2925816,3,B000UVV25Q,"I was rather disappointed in the picture quality for the transfer.  Obviously, when dealing with old film, you're going to have degraded quality, but it's rather remarkable how much worse you can make it with a little bit of incompetence....

First, in many cases, the transfer was clearly made from an analog video recording of the original film.  (All of them may be, but it's obvious on several.)  This manifests itself in the form of picture tearing and flagging in the middle of the image where the head switch occurs.  This can only be caused by one thing, and that's using a crappy analog video recording made on ancient gear as your master instead of recording digitally off the original film... and then not using a time base corrector to clean up the damaged horizontal sync information before you digitize it.  Oops.

Second, as other reviewers have noted, the transfer was done using a video camera with a manual iris/gain adjustment.  This means that when it switches to a black card, in many cases, the card is unreadable until after the transfer engineer noticed the problem and adjusted it.  In some cases, title slides in the silent films are basically unreadable for the entire time they are displayed.  This also manifests itself in scenes that are so dark that all the detail is lost in the noise (for example, the lifeboat scene in Champagne).  To do it right, you need to shoot it multiple times at various gain levels, then splice or dissolve between them at the appropriate transition points.

Third, many films were transferred either using very poor quality prints that had damaged sprocket holes or using a projector that had worn sprockets.  Instead of fixing the problem and redoing the transfer, they left it as-is, which means that the film is jumping up and down for minutes at a time.

Finally, the films are cropped incorrectly.  Newspaper articles in multiple movies are cut off, etc.  Either the aspect ratios of the original films were not 4:3 or they deliberately zoomed in too far to hide the vignetting around the edges.  I'm not sure which.  Either way, it's wrong.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not faulting them for not spending millions of dollars to do a professional restoration of films from that time period, but I could do a better quality transfer using decades-old gear lying around my parents' basement.  This transfer is what I'd expect from one of those shady film-to-video transfer places in the back of a Brooklyn camera shop.  I just keep thinking, ""You can't be serious....""",1301356800,2,2527,4.816705336426915

2925825,2,B000UVV25Q,"For starters, it's great to see Hitchcock's early works.  My big gripes about this collection are how the media was handled.  The transfers are very poor.  I'm not talking about degraded film, which is what it is.  I mean the film was obviously transferred on substandard equipment in a hurry.  They didn't take care in preserving the contrast of the original films or the framing.  It's like they used an old film/video chain with the camera on autoexpose.  So when it cuts to something bright, it's overblown until the autoexpose compensates.  When it cuts to something dark, like a title card, it's fine until the autoexposure responds making for words that blur together.  The framing isn't very good, like words getting chopped off the edge or bottom of the screen etc.  At one point, you can see the transfer system stop, rewind, then resume playing for a brief moment in the middle of a movie.  The times & synopsis on the cover often have nothing to do with the actual program material.  There's also a lot of skips on the DVD.  Finally, there's too many movies on each disk making for bad compression artifacts.  If they were on such a tight budget, they should have broken the load into 2x 4-disk sets on sold them separately.  It was VERY badly handled project done by what I can only assume was an amateur who just didn't care.  It's a shame because there's some great early movies here that would have been much more enjoyable if they had been handled properly.  I'd be almost tempted to find some of those movies and retransfer them myself with a 35mm projector and a DVX100.",1248393600,15,1589,4.617857142857143

2925830,4,B000UVV25Q,"I found this collection in a $5 dollar bargain bin at a Wal-Mart. I bought it for the chance to see some of Hitchcock's early silent films, even though it was a huge double-dip because I already owned most of the movies on Diamond Entertainment's Alfred Hitchcock Collection.

The collection contains several of Hitchcock's early classics. Among them is his most famous silent film, The Lodger (1927), Blackmail (1929)(which incidentally, was the first British talkie), the original The Man who Knew too Much (1934), and the classic spy thriller The 39 Steps (1935)(which is practically a required viewing for any Hitchcock fan).

The collection has all this and more. To some it may sound like a ""too good to be true"" deal. The picture and sound quality varies from film to film, but the silent films are the ones effected worst. Most of them were still watchable, though. I did have a problem with one film, The Lodger. Either it was a bad transfer or a defective disc, because while watching the film, green pixelated images appeared on the TV and almost always caused the disc to freeze. I guess it was the transfer because when I watched another film on the same disc, there were no problems. Unfortunately for me, The Lodger was the first film I chose to watch.

Overall, I would suggest this set for any hard-core Hitchcock fan because it's probably one of the best deals you'll ever find for 20 Hitchcock films. But buyer beware, If you found this in a $5 movie bin, be ready for a possible defect or two. 4 stars.

*** UPDATE ***
Good News! I tried watching The Lodger again, and it worked! Apparently it fixed itself, and I'm very happy. But if it still doesn't work for you, may I suggest the Premiere Collection edition of The Lodger.",1227398400,5,1746,4.640776699029126
2925831,5,B000UVV25Q,"I picked this up at Wal-Mart in the five-dollar bin, desperate for a copy of The Thirty-Nine Steps and willing to risk all of a five-big-dollars-plus-tax for it. What I got was a terrific collection of the early Hitchcock films, including the silents, not remastered but seemingly all taken from surprisingly decent prints, and with good sound--the quality we used to see and be fine with on late night television. All my discs played perfectly including one I'd scratched accidentally. The discs are packed solid with material so if your DVD player is old or dirty you might have problems.

If I waited for Criterion to do up an equivalent package, and that doesn't seem to be happening, I'd probably end up paying over $200 for the whole shebang. This $5 deal leaves me with $195 to go out and get another DVD player, or even a new lawnmower. Not bad.

Batches of defective discs turn up all the time. It just happens. If a customer, immediately after purchase, swaps a bad disc or set in for a replacement it's likely they'll get another from the same batch. At some point the retailer realizes something is amiss and sends everything back to the distributor. Nobody's selling you defective DVDs because they think it's a swell idea.
