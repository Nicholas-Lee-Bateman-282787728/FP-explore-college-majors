1665439,4,B00005UKKG,"Somebody brought this over to watch, I had never even heard of it. I watched this with really low expectations, and came away with a decent story of 2 brothers (1 white/1 black), and their struggles with life.
One struggles with drugs while the other simply struggles with himself, you don't really find out why immediately though. Deborah Cox did an excellent job as a side story about her life while playing one of the brother's girlfriend.
All in all it was a really low budget movie with an entertaining cast and story that kept me interested (not easy to do) till the end.",1029628800,5,577,4.5576923076923075
1665440,4,B00005UKKG,"The problem is that this is being sold as a love story, which it most certainly is not. This is a story about two brothers and the family secrets they buried between them. This is about how a family gets torn apart by unforeseeable circumstances. This is about what it takes to hold together. It is a very compelling and moving drama. The performances by both Larenz Tate and Martin Cummins were commendable. Although I agree is not the highest caliber film, I feel was done well.",1024617600,3,480,4.528735632183908
1665441,3,B00005UKKG,"No this movie is not an Academy Award Winner.  However, since I am a Substance Abuse Counselor I found great Value in the context of this movie.  If you want to see the effects of substance abuse and keeping secrets has on families then this is a good representative.",1020124800,3,267,4.428571428571429
1665442,1,B00005UKKG,"Love Come Down stars Larenz Tate and Deborah Cox.  I did not recognize the rest of the cast by name or face.  Let me first say that I am a BIG fan of Larenz Tate.  He is one awesome actor.  His past work includes Love Jones, Dead Presidents, Why Do Fools Fall In Love, The Inkwell and Menace II Society.  Deborah Cox is an excellent songstress and her acting appearance in Soul Food The Series was good.  However, this movie proves that a good cast alone can't carry the entire project.  A solid storyline, good directing, editing and writing helps.
I really could not get into this video.  The directing execs did a poor job of mixing scenes of the past into the present.  Now that I have given my opinion let me summarize the movie/video...
A singer and a young man meet in a night club and there is chemistry.  After getting together for a night, the story depicts two people from two different backgrounds...yet both are just as dysfunctional as the other.  The characters deal with drug abuse and addiction, child abuse, murder, family secrets, fears, love, sex and rivalry.  Sounds like the perfect ingredients for a good movie...DON'T bet the WHOLE hog on it.",1017792000,3,1166,4.579710144927536
1665443,1,B00005UKKG,"I've never heard of this movie, but when I saw it at ...[the local video store], I just knew it was going to be good...NOT!... Larenz Tate was great to look at, and Deborah Cox, I could listen to her sing all day.  But that movie was just dumb.  What was the point to it?  It was just no story line at all.  First of all, I think they should have used a biracial child to play Larenz's part, because they were all off in that area.  Maybe they should have had their friend play it.  It would have been more believable.  Oh well, don't waste your money on this one.",1017792000,,564,4.027027027027027
1665444,1,B00005UKKG,"Alright now Larenz Tate is an excellent actor, but this movie is not worth applying towards his credits.  The story line could have been good, but the way they unfolded this story line was boring!!!!!!
Deborah Cox is an extraodinary singer and the little bits that you hear in this movie is the  best part of the movie.  Now this should have been a made for t.v. movie, because the little nude scenes could have been omitted and the few cuss words were not necessary either.  I wish Larenz Tate had scrapped this movie and went back to the drawing board and started over.  Sorry, not a good dvd.",1017446400,4,595,4.422018348623853

7954626,5,B00005UKKG,Each person had to let go in order to move on. The guilt they carried with them made them make some wrong decisions in their lives. Love and honesty brought them through it and it was a happy ending for everyone. Kudos for Mr. Tate directing this movie.,1363910400,,253,4.291666666666667

7954628,4,B00005UKKG,"I wish Canadian films like this weren't so damn hard to find down here in the States. It's a good movie, has excellent character development. My only complaint: Larenz Tate isn't that great, not sure he really carried the lead in this. He was pretty much eclipsed by Martin Cummins' performance. Cummins won a lot of Canadian awards for this role. Also, the DVD should have more of a 'making of' extra.",1200614400,5,402,4.597222222222222

7954630,4,B00005UKKG,"Larenz Tate was the executive producer of Love Come Down. At first I wasn't interested in seeing the film when it first came out but then I thought it might be good later on. It didn't bore me and it kept my attention. Overall, it was a good movie.",1041638400,,248,4.081632653061225
