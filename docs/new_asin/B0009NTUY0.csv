8209864,5,B0009NTUY0,Very interesting style of golf.  I find that this method is very hard to control.  I can't seem to master the left wrist part that he talks about. (cupping)  I find that I tend to hit slices with this method.  If I keep my left wrist straight on the backswing and use his method for the remainder of the swing then it works well.  I lose that slice on my shots.  All in all I like the tape and hope to use most of the teaching method exlpaines by AJ.  Someday I would like to get out to San Diego and take one of his lessons.  I would recommend this tape.,1413676800,,555,3.936936936936937
