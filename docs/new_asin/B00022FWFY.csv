From start to finish...it is very interesting and REAL..not something that was staged or anything...this was REAL..and it was REALLY FUNNY and worth tha money...

I'm gonna get part 2 tha next time I'm in tha area...iight..",1107907200,,365,4.367647058823529
2056243,5,B00022FWFY,"I picked this up from Bestbuy because the cover and description looked funny. When I got to watching it I couldn't stop laughing. Its kind of like Jackass except a couple of guys go around offering to pay people to do crazy most of the time embarassing things  like stick your head in a porta pottie for a 100 bucks or smear yor face in dog poop for 300 bucks.  Then they film the person doing it usually with a bunch of people around.  all real though. This one is at least worth a rent  but if you buy it you will laugh, trust me",1103155200,3,531,4.0285714285714285

2056250,5,B00022FWFY,"Addictive!  I love this show!  I'm not a fan of William Macy at all, though that opinion is just personal.  He creeps me out.  I didn't watch this show for the first 4 years, just because I can't stand him.  Since I give this series 5 stars, I hope you realize how great this show is.

I won't go into the premise here, you can find it elsewhere, but basically it is a loser family of neglectful parents who are trying to make the best of their lives.  And they are all awesome.  My favorites are Emmy Rossen, (Fiona), and Jeremy Allen White, who plays ""Lip"" short for Phillip.  Absolutely great show!

NOTE TO NON-NUDITY TYPES!!!  Full nudity (front and back), oral and anal sex scenes, foul language.  Sexual play toys!",1494720000,,721,4.419847328244275
