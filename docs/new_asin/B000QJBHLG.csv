8196536,4,B000QJBHLG,"I saw this movie when it came out in Spain in 2006, and I'm still hoping that it will come out on Region 1 format.  The movie is about a Spanish family who moves from Spain to Switzerland to seek work during the Franco era.  They have to deal with the struggle of adapting to a new culture, and the movie points out the differences between Spain and Switzerland in the mid twentieth century.  The family is forced to overcome many of their biases and cultural prejudices in order to survive in their new country, and watching them do so is a delightful experience.  The father adapts well enough to both German and the culture, the mother to neither, and their young son grows up more Swiss than Spanish.  At the end of the movie they move back to Franco's Spain and their reaction to counterculture shock is equally fascinating.

This is not the greatest movie of all times, but it is charming.  Watching it as an American who had lived in Spain for 7 months, I found that a lot of the movie resonated with my own experiences of trying to fit in and overcoming both my own biases and the biases against Americans in Spain.  I would highly recommend this movie and think that it would do well in a Spanish culture class.",1218585600,2,1220,4.391111111111111
