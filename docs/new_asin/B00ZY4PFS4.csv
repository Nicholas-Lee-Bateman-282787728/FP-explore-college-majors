7296062,3,B00ZY4PFS4,Homicide Hunter is a great series.  Joe Kenda has made it to my list of heroes of our time.  I watch and hear every episode.  I just need DVDs with closed captions.  If this DVD had the closed captions it would have received five stars.  My okay rating has more to do with my needs than the series.,1444435200,6,298,4.068965517241379

7296071,5,B00ZY4PFS4,"I already loved HH with Lt. Kenda but we changed our Dish satellite settings and could no longer view it.  Since I only recently discovered it and our internet is rural and not great, streaming was out.  Litcessory got my DVDs to me in a big hurry in stellar condition and I was able to watch my program.  I tend not to watch lots of programs, an hour at most a day, so getting my DVDs quickly was much appreciated.  Customer service was stellar.  I also Ordered seasons 3 & 4 and have yet to watch them.  I lose interest in most such programs, but I enjoy HH because it's reality but not glamorized.  In the past I have enjoyed Dr. G, Medical Examiner much for the same reason.  I enjoy seeing and learning from the processes, not getting sucked into drama and trying to discern reality-based or fiction.  This is reality, straight-forward from the point of view of a dedicated and retired Colorado Springs Homicide Detective.",1504310400,,927,4.502994011976048
