I was excited as a Thelemite,  that it was coming since I expected a work of art based on Master Therion's writings, and I got a steaming dung hill instead!",1384560000,,274,3.981818181818182
8574230,1,B00BUV9Z72,Very poor quality recording. I was extremely disappointed. As a Thelemite these rites of Eleusis are sacred to me. I do not think these are of the quality as advertised and should be removed.,1384560000,,191,4.647058823529412
8574231,5,B00BUV9Z72,"I received Eleusyve Productions 'The Rite of Sol: A Rock Opera; today and viewed it immediately. Once again the Eleusyve team have produced a remarkable stage performance of Aleister Crowley's Rites of Eleusis adapted to modern rock music and made accessible to a much wider audience.

Superb performances by Jon Sewell, Melissa Holm, Richard Cardone, Sunnie Larsen and the entire cast make this another solid and admirable performance by an outstanding theatre group and I could not recommend this DVD highly enough for anyone interested in the subject matter or simple a fan of great stage theatre.",1365724800,3,600,5.185567010309279
8574232,5,B00BUV9Z72,"I purchased Eleusyve Productions 'The Rite of Mercury' very shortly after it was released into a DVD format. I purchased this DVD and found it to be a theatrical performance per excellence. Tho it may help to have some knowledge of the content and history of the content of the Rites of Eleusis, Eleusyve productions have made this production into a rock opera which makes the content very accessible to the greater public. Remarkable performances by the lead characters, Jon Sewell, Sunnie Larsen, Richard Cardone etc are masterful and poignant. I could not recommend this DVD highly enough to anyone interested in Aleister Crowley's Rites and the work of an outstanding theatre company!

I eagerly awaited the Rite of Mercury after having bought it's predecessors, the Rites of Luna and Venus, equally comparable and excellent productions. This DVD cannot be recommended enough to fan's of Aleister Crowley's work and poetry.",1364515200,3,927,5.18
8574233,5,B00BUV9Z72,"And do we ever!  Great acting, writing, singing, we have a lot of talent here in Seattle. I was lucky enough to see the live performance of this in November, and it was superb!

Jon and Melissa are a very talented couple, and I can't wait to see the next one!  The rest of the cast were really great too, some very talented musicians and singers.

Very visually entertaining, done with humour, too, and the costume design was great!!  I totally recommend this one, well worth buying the dvd and supporting the OTO in Seattle towards their next production, and their amazing effort to get all this together.

Crowley would have dug this, I'm pretty sure.  :)

Thanks Jon, thanks Melissa, and to everybody else too.",1363478400,3,713,4.603174603174603
