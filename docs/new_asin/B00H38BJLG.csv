8629406,2,B00H38BJLG,"My opinion is not important but the response from my child is what matters. She usually loves Miffy! But this movie doesn't cut it. Sorry to say that the unfamiliar voice for Miffy & the new format in this movie will take some time to get used to. And maybe it's too hard to drag on for an hour and still maintain an interesting plot...This one is a bit boring to my child. She usually has no problem enjoying or learning through an one-hour video, but somehow could not sit through this one. She was already looking for another video or activity instead.",1514592000,,555,4.398058252427185

8629409,4,B00H38BJLG,"My daughter loved this, but I found it a little annoying that the characters talk in this one (with voices that don't match the age of the characters!), vs the narrator speaking for the characters like a story book. But oh well.",1465257600,,228,4.4523809523809526
8629410,5,B00H38BJLG,"This one isn't flashy, but it is great for little kids.  It always has a quieting effect on my little ones.  Great to show them when you want them to quiet down for a nap.",1455840000,,171,3.857142857142857
8629411,5,B00H38BJLG,Absolutely lovely film! Wish there were more like this one for children. I had purchased it in the European format a couple of years ago when it wasn't available in the US. So happy to see it released here.,1453420800,,206,4.3076923076923075

8629414,5,B00H38BJLG,Great movie! My 2 1/2 year old son just loved this - he thoroughly enjoyed the songs and humor in the movie. It is very gentle and sweet.,1431820800,,137,3.9285714285714284
8629415,5,B00H38BJLG,"We love Miffy. My girls love her and my husband and I aren't annoyed by the show like some of the kiddie stuff out there. It was strange to hear Miffy and her friends talking instead of being narrated, but the songs are fun and we got used to it quickly. Cute movie, wish it had had a theatre opening here in the states so we could've watched it on the big screen first but this is great.",1420156800,,388,3.9871794871794872
