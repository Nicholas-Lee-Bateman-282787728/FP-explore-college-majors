6351419,2,B00JAD6CDM,A little static and boring,1480636800,,26,4.4
6351420,1,B00JAD6CDM,"This is ridiculous! A dreary narrator drones on with a dialog of Cliff's notes about WWII, while a full psychedelic light-show plays on screen. There is very, very little in the way of photography or film from the period...mostly swirling color spirochetes, twirling pillars of light, spinning whirligigs, fountains of pixelated lights and other junk that looks like computer ""screen-saver"" animations. I rarely leave a one star review, but this is just bad.",1478908800,4,458,5.287671232876712
6351421,2,B00JAD6CDM,"This attempts to summarize WWII in about 30 minutes. It is not written by a native speaker of English and the person narrating can't pronounce many of the key words. It also has some strange talking points, such as focusing on Australia's part in the war. Maybe it was intended for that market but it just seems weird. The photos are good. A brave effort but not good compared to most other documentaries.",1477008000,,405,4.561643835616438
6351422,5,B00JAD6CDM,Excellent coverage of events.,1465344000,,29,6.5
6351423,4,B00JAD6CDM,"Well done, really covers almost all aspects of the war, and it's not boring, but it is a DIARY! Very interesting a has very few glitches I.E. Aircraft are wrong types in one or two instances, buy this in BOTH volumes if you can find them!",1435104000,,238,4.195652173913044
6351424,5,B00JAD6CDM,Interesting and informative.,1416700800,,28,8.666666666666666
6351425,5,B00JAD6CDM,"My husband, a WWII buff, encouraged me to watch these.  I have to say that I thought they were very interesting.  I was a very young child at the time of WWII and now realize I had a rather skewed idea of the events forged mostly from movies.  This series goes day by day showing the very slow progression of the war. Well worth watching.",1405123200,3,338,4.1692307692307695
8649335,1,B00JAD6CDM,"It takes about 20 seconds to realise this is a no-budget production using stock shots and cheesy screensaver type backgrounds.
Even the voiceover seems artificial.  There are so many better documentaries available that don't seem like they are made by aliens.",1521936000,,259,5.317073170731708
8649336,1,B00JAD6CDM,"Terrible!  Boring, few photos, and barely any videos.  Looks like a power point presentation.",1515715200,,93,5.571428571428571
8649337,1,B00JAD6CDM,Easily one of the worst documentaries I have ever seen on any subject.,1501632000,,70,4.461538461538462
8649338,2,B00JAD6CDM,boring,1501286400,,6,6.0
8649339,5,B00JAD6CDM,I listen to some of these documentaries when I can't sleep because the narration drones.  This one does this wonderfully without my desire to not miss interesting pictures and videos - because it has none!  This is better than sleeping pills.,1492905600,,242,4.878048780487805
8649340,4,B00JAD6CDM,Good series,1491696000,,11,5.0
8649341,1,B00JAD6CDM,"I didn't think that 1.5 stars could possibly be an accurate rating, but it is. Terrible. Almost no photography and video footage with the remainder of the time filled with special effects that look like the visualizer from iTunes (psychedelic modulating colors, etc.). I also think the narration may have been a computer synthesized voice.",1484438400,3,339,5.181818181818182
8649342,1,B00JAD6CDM,This ww2 doc is a joke right? At first I just thought that somehow my idle screensaver and the video became intertwined. 0 stars if I could.,1483920000,,140,4.222222222222222
8649343,1,B00JAD6CDM,"With a background in psychology it only took me about 30 seconds to realize that all the shifting psychedelic images are an attempt to generate some form of hypnosis in the watcher, with very little actual information about the war presented.  I don't know what their game is, but this thing isn't worth watching for a number of reasons.",1483488000,,337,4.711864406779661
8649344,1,B00JAD6CDM,"If you know nothing about WW2, this is not the film to start with.
If you know anything about WW2, this film will disgust you.
Don't waste your time!",1481846400,,149,4.172413793103448
