8223612,1,B000WLNMSO,This might have been great if it had had sub-titles.  The french seem to think their language is perfect and everybody ought to know it - I can do some Spanish but trying to follow a french movie without sub-titles is really hard for me.,1348099200,3,237,4.266666666666667
8223613,1,B000WLNMSO,"Charlotte forever is purely a collector's item and must be handled with extreme caution. In Japan, Charlotte Gainsbourg is best known by her earlier films with nice coming-of-age dramas such as L'Effrontee and The Little Thief. This drama goes to extremes by indicating Father-daughter incest. When the film was shot Charlotte was only 15 or 16.  Had it not been by Serge, the director might have been busted. Drama part is weak as well making this work just a promotional video to showcase Charlotte's teen erotica. What's more baffling is that Serge's touching the boobs of his daughter's friend!! If this merchandise is dealt with caution to be legal in some countries such as what we can see in Japan, I guess it is Ok to market in the U.S. It's safer to recogize this item as R-rated movie.

Verdict: Charlotte is cute and sexy but that's it. Lighting is dark and the drama is boring.
Rating: 14 out of 100
Recommended for: Die-hard fans of Charlotte and Serge Gainsbourg. Not recommended for Charlotte starters.",1332806400,2,1017,4.805714285714286
