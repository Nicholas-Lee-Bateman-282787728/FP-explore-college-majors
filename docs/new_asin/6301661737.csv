343865,5,6301661737,"I was blown away by this insanely-great movie...you'll be captured by the stroyline, as Ikeda Shingen attempts to keep his realm in one piece, by having a petty thief lookalike stand in for him before he dies. Pay close  attention to 1) the scene when the dying warlord says, ""Ugoku  na!"" (Do not move, or do not  start any military expeditions, or  else...) and the final battle scene, when Ikeda's brave army is simply  destroyed. Sad, but rich in history, color, drma, etc. Watch it, enjoy it,  and you'll never forget this movie.",946339200,3,533,4.67741935483871
343866,5,6301661737,"If it were possible for someone to construct a list of Kurosawa's best films this one would be near the top.  Helped by a unforgetable performance by Tatsuya Nakadai, a dazzling use of color, and Kurosawa's camera floating  above all the deceit and mayhem like an angry God, Kagemusha is a film for  the ages and a blueprint of what action films can be.  The closing sequence  with Kurosawa killing men and horses is slow motion while an agonized  Nakadai looks on is absolutely glorious and inspiring.  A Must See!",943833600,3,515,4.655555555555556
343867,5,6301661737,"QUESTION for starters: where can one find the ORIGINAL version of Kagemusha? (if only for the edited scenes with Takeshi Shimura!)
Kagemusha is simply breathtaking. The opening sequence  challenges any doubts and skepticism about the subtle yet powerful  capabilities for theatre conventions in filmmaking - it is a fascinating  long take/meeting of minds and gigantic themes (!) the movie later  develops.
Much has been said about Nakadai's melodramatic performance in  this film, but for me it was only fitting with Kagemusha's ornate and  formal compositions. This is not a Kurosawa-epic in the tradition for  realism in the likes of Seven Samurai. Artifice reigns supreme here.  Kurosawa opted for this with the most awe-inspiring indulgence in form,  contrasting it with a most chilling (mauve) theme about  reality-vs-illusion.
At the end I can't help but miss the super-human yet  human-like, life-affirming yet wickedly contradictory heroes portrayed by  Mifune in earlier-Kurosawa, but it's a different kind of pleasure and  learning experience with Kagemusha. A difference of evolving style that  justifies why Kurosawa was truly a sensei of cinematic arts.",925603200,12,1167,5.556818181818182
343868,5,6301661737,"Wow, what a movie experience!  ""Kagemusha (The Shadow Warrior)"" is my favorite film from direct Akira Kurosawa, which is saying one heck of a lot when one considers ""Rashomon"", ""Seven Samurai"", and ""Ran"".  I sat riveted  to the television screen during the entire presentation.  It is a story of  a petty thief who, because he looks very much like the great Warlord  Shingen, is given the chance to redeem himself and play the great Warlord's  double.  The heart of the film is the inner change and new found strength  that progresses through the thief as he learns to become the Warlord.  Awesome in its imagery, ""Kagemusha"" will mesmerize you and move you.  Between 1 and 10, this powerful Kurosawa classic gets a 10.  With his  passing, along with Stanley Kubrick, the world has lost two great  treasures.",924048000,129,808,4.802919708029197
343869,5,6301661737,"Here's one example of a film whose power lies firmly in the visual and aesthetic departments.  Kagemusha is beautiful beyond belief, filled with cinematic wonder, confident in the sheer force of imagery.
Much has been  made of the melodramatic style of acting that Nakadai Tatsuyo indulges in,  both here and in Ran (1985).  Kagemusha benefits from the fact that it  doesn't give Nakadai as much incentive to overplay -- as opposed to the  King Lear madness of Ran, which provided Nakadai with a stage to receive  his overacting.  Kagemusha, thankfully, dwells in the exquisite art designs  (Kurosawa Akira took years to draw out the storyboards, having been unable  to get the film produced for a long time), perfect compositions,  inexhaustible wealth of colours, and sublime lighting.  Deservedly the  highest-grossing Japanese film of its time and, I would argue, Kurosawa's  masterpiece.",918259200,7,892,5.2785714285714285

343919,4,6301661737,"This 1980 film by director Akira Kurosawa, like Seven Samurai, is set during the later 16th century civil wars which preceded the unification of Japan under the Tokugawa Shogunate at the beginning of the 17th century. The film revolves around a ""kagemusha"", which is a political double, or decoy. In this case the kagemusha fills in for an historically accurate daimyo (feudal lord) by the name of Takeda Shingen, who dies in the midst of the wars. In the film Shingen is killed by a sniper (guns were introduced into Japan by 16th century European explorers and traders). But that cause of death has never been established with historical certainty. Shingen's kagemusha, who is a fictional character, buys time for the Takeda clan to get its act together before rival warlords can learn of Shingen's death, and attack. There are plenty of colorful battle scenes but blood and gore have been kept to a minimum. If you enjoy films based on historical events you'll probably like this one - though ironically the title character is pure fiction. The film runs 3 hours.",1472428800,8,1066,4.862637362637362

IMPORTANT: This is the review of Criterion Collection: Kagemusha [2-DVD] [1980]

""Kagemusha"" is the story of just three years of the incredible but true and short but extremely intense saga of Takeda clan. The period of great importance of Takeda was in years 1536-1582, but this film tells just the story of the dramatic years 1573 to 1575, from the siege of Noda castle to battle of Nagashino. In order to better understand the events described in ""Kagemusha"" it is helpful to know the main events of the history of the Takeda clan in the previous years, as they are ocassionally referred to, but not fully explained.
-----
In 1536 Takeda Nobutora, the head of Takeda clan, was the daimyo of impoverished mountainous province of Kai. But not only was this province a dirt poor backwater, but the Takeda didn't even really control of all it, as some of their nominal retainers, like the Hirada family, were in fact completely independent. Therefore the Takeda were really just a little, not very wealthy provincial samurai clan, without much importance. In 1536 Takeda Nobutora lost an important battle against the Hirada family, but soon after Takeda Harunobu, his then barely 15-years old son, avenged the defeat and destroyed completely the Hirada, greatly stregthening the position of his clan.

That great achievement notwithstanding, there was not much love between father and son and Harunobu, although being the oldest son, was not designed as heir - that position went to his younger brother Nobushige instead. Refusing this, Takeda Harunobu in 1541 seized the power and banished his father. Both his younger brothers decided to stay in Kai and remain loyal to Harunobu - when ""Kagemusha"" begins, Nobushige was already dead (see below) but second brother, Nobukado, is one the main characters in the film. Takeda Nobuzane, his half-brother, who was still a child at that moment, also was going to serve him loyally once fully grown up.

The new leader was very ambitious and even if he had now all the Kai under his control he immediately attacked other daimyos from the neighboring province of Shinano, destroying first the Murakami clan. His next target as the Suwa clan, which was comprehensively defeated in 1542 - their leader, Suwa Yorishige, was taken prisoner and later murdered. Of all the Suwa clan only the daughter of Suwa Rorishige survived (we don't know her name - she is known only as Princess Suwa) - impressed by her beauty Takeda Harunobu took her as a concubine and she gave him his favorite son, Takeda Katsuyori, who is another important character in the film.

Having completed the conquest of Shinano province and having signed the alliance with the powerful Imagawa daimyo of Suruga, young Harunobu beacame a very famous and powerful warlord - from that moment he was called ""The Tiger of Kai"". It was at that moment, that encouraged by his main strategist, Yamamoto Kansuke, he had made a new war banner, under which the Takeda clan would fight from now on - and which would become a legend in its own. This banner was called ""Furin Kazan"", from characters signifying ""Wind, Forest, Fire, Mountain"" and the flag itself carried the inscription taken from Sun Tzu's writings, precising the characteristics necessary for a great general: ""Fast as the wind, silent as the forest, ardent as the fire, calm as the mountain"".

His next target was the province of Echigo and its young lord Nagao Kagetora, who had the particularity of being not only an exceptionnal warrior but also a buddhist monk, better known under his religious name Uesugi Kenshin and also called ""The Dragon of Echigo"". The long confrontation between the ""Tiger of Kai"" and ""Dragon of Echigo"" lasted 14 years, roughly from 1550 to 1564, fighting no less than five battles at the Kawanakajima plain!

In 1559 Takeda Harunobu decided to become himself a novice Buddhist monk and took a new name - from that moment on he was known as Takeda Shingen.

The culmination of the confrontation between those two warlords was the fourth battle of Kawanakajima, in 1561, in which at one moment Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin fought one against other, swords in hand! Takeda Shingen was wounded during this fight - as you will see, the scar from this wound plays an important role in ""Kagemusha"" plot. The battle itself however was a draw - Uesugi Kenshin lost more soldiers (4000 against 3000 for the Takeda clan) but he could withdraw without being bothered by exhausted enemies. The Takeda clan lost also two precious generals - the famous strategist Yamamoto Kansuke and Shingen's loyal younger brother, Takeda Nobushige.

Realizing that his fight against Uesugi Kenshin is a dead end, Takeda Shingen made ultimately peace with his old nemesis in 1564. Uesugi Kenshin appears briefly in ""Kagemusha"" without being openly named - you will recognize him by his impressive monastic clothes and the buddhist rosary he always held in hands. Both warlords needed peace because a new power was rising in Japan - Oda Nobunaga, the terrifying and somehow extravagant daimyo of Owari, who apears a lot in ""Kagemusha"" (including a greatly hilarious scene in which he and his guest taste some Portuguese wine or like they call it ""barbarian sake""...).

In 1560 Oda Nobunaga greatly weakened the powerful Imagawa clan from Suruga by winning the battle of Okehazama. Seeing that Suruga province was now ripe for picking, Takeda Shingen betrayed his Imagawa allies and finally seized this precious land in 1569. The Takeda clan was now a major power and one of two top pretenders to the control over all Japan. The only rival of the Takeda was the alliance between Oda Nobunaga and a young daimyo from Mikawa, a certain Matsudaira Takechiyo, who in 1567 changed his name and became Tokugawa Ieyasu - this latter famous character also appears in ""Kagemusha""...

In 1567 Takeda Yoshinobu, Shingen's oldest son by his wife, Lady Sanjo, rebelled against his father resenting his favouritism towards Katsuyori. Easily defeated, Yoshinobu was forced by his father to commit seppuku.

After defeating Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu in some minor engagements and in the major battle at Mikatagahara on 25 January 1573, he then besieged, at the end of January 1573 the castle of Noda defended by 500 samurai and ashigaru loyal to Tokugawa. This is AT THAT MOMENT THAT ""Kagemusha"" BEGINS - and I will not say much more about the action of the film.
---------------------

""Kagemusha"" means ""the shadow warrior"" and in feudal Japan was the word designing the decoys used by some warlords to impersonate them in various occasions, to avoid risks of assasination or to let them recover in peace from sickness or simply to allow them to catch a moment of rest during the campaign... The use of ""kagemushas"" was a common practice and it gave of course occasion to some wild rumors - according to some of them, Tokugawa Ieyasu himself was supposedly killed at the second siege of Osaka in 1615 and during the following 12 months was replaced by a decoy, the time that his power is safely transmitted to his son (that story is almost certainly NOT true). In our times the decoys are also used - the most famous was certainly Clifton James, a simple solider who for a time impersonated Montgomery, in order to deceive Axis intelligence services...

This film tells the story of a fictitious ""kagemusha"", as Takeda Shingen was not known for using one. Both Shingen and his double are played by the great Japanese actor Tatsuya Nakadai - and as always, he does a great job. Other important characters are Takeda Nobukado (Shingen's younger brother), Takeda Katsuyori (Shingen's favourite son) and Takemaru (real name Takeda Nobukatsu), Shingen's grandson, aged 5 at the beginning of the film.

Takeda Shingen was famous for gathering around him 24 excellent commanders, known as Twenty Four Generals of the Takeda. In 1573, when the film begins, many were already dead, so in this film we see only seven of them, including Takeda Nobukado. The most important character amongst them is Yamagata Masakage, the old man with red face. Two other real generals I managed to identify were Hara Masatane and Naito Masatoyo. Those are the three generals who at one moment cross their lances together, in an extremely powerful scene towards the end of the film.

Other than the scenario, which is excellent, as always in Kurosawa films, the great treasure of this film are the images. Samurai armies are impressive, battles are even better and the sequences of the dreams (or rather nightmares) are very powerful.

The final scenes of the great battle of Nagashino are of course a very beautiful thing from the artistic point of view, but the REAL battle was absolutely NOT such a one sided affair as it is pictured. Kurosawa needed to adapt this battle to obtain a Wagnerian finale and also there is no question that this battle ended with a great disaster for one of the sides - but still, in real history, things went VERY differently from what we see in ""Kagemusha"".

On another hand, the character of Oda Nobunaga is IMPRESSIVELY good! In this film he appears really as a warlord for whom thousands would be ready to rise, fight - and die.

The film doesn't say (sorry SPOILER coming) what would happen later to three of the most important characters, Takeda Nobukado, Takeda Katsuyori and little Takemaru (yes, here is the SPOILER - they survive to the final credits). And honestly I would advise you to NOT research this question before watching ""Kagemusha"". Do it after. Believe me, it is a good advice.

CONCLUSION: this film is a masterpiece; it lasts 3 hours but at the end you will only feel sorry that there is no more; a film to buy, watch, keep and re-watch. Enjoy!",1381449600,7,9915,4.908059701492538

344094,5,6301661737,"""It is not easy to suppress yourself to become another. Often I wanted to be myself and free.""
-quote from Akira Kurosawa's Kagemusha.

Set in the Sengoku Era of Japan, Kurosawa's masterful (if historically inaccurate) story deals with one ambitious warlord's orders that end up severely straining and testing the very limits of his subjects' loyalty. In a society built upon the very notion of honor and duty, how much is one meant to endure in order to keep a promise? How much of our behavior results in a change of fate, or are we doomed to forever live in the shadow of our predestined fates?

Is free will futile? If not, then to what degree is free will necessarily a good thing if it constantly torments us to do things we musn't?

Deeper, unanswered questions such as these rise again and again, albeit in subtle form, interlaced with the film's surreal, beautiful cinematography.",1364774400,2,889,4.759740259740259

344099,1,6301661737,"Kurosawa's Seven Samurai was one of the greatest films ever made showing the life of a village that will be destroyed without the help of the Samurai; but this film lacks in all areas.

The digital transfer looks too ""real"" having that cheap video tv like sharpness (was it shot on video?). The color lacked the range of film (even film transferred to video). The brights were too bright nearly over-driving the TV circuitry no mater how I adjusted my $3,000 USD TV set.

The military history aspect shows the leaders as fools that just advance into gunfire to be killed not having any strategy. One reviewer says this is due to cutting of important war scenes from this Lucas-&-Coppola version. In that vein it is like an American liberal's view of war that just stupidly sends people out to die without any strategy in the activity thus the war scenes fall flat seeming dumb. Generally it lacks some of the expected Asian point of view throughout thus it looses some of its essential cultural fascination.

It has no love plot really, just a reference to main character's mistresses. Maybe the older writer Kurosawa does not see the need for romance but a younger audience would want it. A shame to miss the Asian innocent beauty character in the women.

The story lacks complexity early on and when it does get some later it is poorly developed and obvious like a child's movie intellectually. Was this written by a high-school kid? The body double is essentially ""thrown into the streets"" a foolish act when he has so much insider information; are these people really that dumb; could this stupidity be historically accurate?

This is typical of some late works in the arts where great artists lack whatever-it-is-they-had-in-the-beginning and now just do technically correct poor art be it music or movies.

The music soundtrack is literally as bad as 1970's television. No orchestra here but just tracks laid down from ""library"" pre-made music. Some of it sounded Spanish in origin as a horn in the background as one would expect in an old western.

Overall an eclectic mix of technique that comes together like a low budget (under $500,000) TV movie of the week. UG! All the high ratings probably come from a film class at some school that is obsessed with Kurosawa's work.",1331078400,3,2280,4.786259541984733

I had a nasty stomach virus. I was not hungry and I couldn't eat, and felt wretched myself.

Sam has become interested in the Kurosawa samurai movies in the last year or so. The symbolic plots validating honor, courage, and duty of the warriors to their fellows appeal to him greatly at this time in his life. After all, with college starting in the fall, he is about to embark on a searching adventure of his own.

I kept thinking how wonderful it is to listen to the Japanese language. I hadn't heard it for a long time.

In our house we speak English and Serbian. Other than on special occasions, it is rare that other languages are heard.

This was not the case in my childhood home.

My parents spoke no foreign languages themselves. But our TV did.

All foreign films and shows were subtitled, nothing was dubbed, and there was an abundance of foreign programs from all parts of the world.

As a very young girl, before I had learned to read, I remember begging my cousin to read the Bonanza subtitles to me. She was only two years older and a new reader herself, but she tried the best she could. It didn't matter when she made a mistake. It was the sounds that enchanted us anyway.

I can remember even now (if I squint and try hard) how English sounded before I could understand the meaning of the words.

The intonation of those sounds (so foreign to a Slavic ear) combined with images of adventure, opulence, temptation, daring, beauty, and so much else that was different and astonishing, were as irresistible and seductive as any love song.

But I also remember other languages, interwoven with their own stories, faces and images, and how they sounded to my ear.

The comfort and familiar resonance, but also poetry, sadness and suffering that is such an integral part of the Russian language.

The dreamy lyricism of Sofia Loren's Italian that seemed to carry the very warmth of its native landscape in its melody.

The elegant playfulness of Jean Paul Belmono's French, breaking those entrenched, but tired, bourgeois rules in unexpected and enchanting ways.

The mysterious, murky tonality of Chinese from the 1950's movies where poor multitudes suffered terribly under the rule of merciless landlords.

The brittle, alarming pitch of samurai jangle, the language almost as violent as the action.

A week ago Sam registered for his fall college classes. Japanese language is one of the subjects that he will be taking. I can't wait to hear him speaking like a samurai.

344123,5,6301661737,"As ostensibly the 109th reviewer of this astonishing film in Amazon's irrelevant list, there is no need to recapitulate its history, plot, or merits.
What are at issue are the following: A. Why did n't ALL reviewers award this 5 stars? B. How justifiable are the technical criticisms such as the quality of the transfer, and whether indeed one can actually play this DVD at all?
To deal with the first question, several highly intelligent reviewers withheld at least one star because they did not consider it to be Kurosawa's finest film, and others because they thought it less good than RAN. Both arguments are difficult to justify. This was Kurosawa's great leap forward into the world of colour. What a leap! And what colour! He started life as a painter, and judging by the many magnificent examples featured in the Extras, a very talented painter too. For 5 years he churned out paintings of scenes he had in mind for Kagemusha, although its gestation period was closer to a full decade. He painted the film first on paper, and then went on to paint it on the camera. In doing so, he created perhaps the greatest true Art Film up to that time. No film that I know contains a greater profusion of beautiful shots and images, both in their composition and their colour, although the same can be said of RAN. Plot and characters are almost dispensable. You can switch to the commentary, sit back, and allow your eyes to be ravished by the images that emerge from the screen. It is like touring a Gallery displaying the retrospective exhibition of a great artist. The characters don't speak; you don't quite follow all the action in each painting; but these frozen moments in time capture the viewer more so than the work of any other film-maker. Kagemusha's great leap compares with Beethoven's Eroica and Picasso's Les Demoiselles D'Avignon, the ascent to the highest level from which point further advances were simply along a plateau. Seen in this light and knowing that it was, however fine, derivative of its great predecessor, I cannot understand the logic of awarding RAN a higher rating. It does have the advantage of a simpler story-line and one more familiar to Western audiences through King Lear. The one significant fault in Kagemusha is the tortuous plot and the fact that all the characters seem to look alike. It is inevitable that the Thief and the Brother should do so, as they both served as doubles for Shingen; but it is also hard to distinguish the various other warlords and generals. I am sure that Oriental audiences would not have this problem, but it is well known that  an untrained Western eye finds it difficult to recognize the facial individuality of Japanese, Chinese, or even African Blacks. Kurosawa's rapid transitions and the similarity of dress  compound the problem. I found it impossible to separate the soldiers of one warlord from those of another during the battle scenes, and this was my 3rd viewing of the film. The marvellous voice-over commentary by Stephen Prince is a great help, and I would strongly counsel any first-time viewer to play the movie in this mode before moving to the full version with subtitles. Contrary to some comments, Prince skilfully draws attention to technical and stylistic elements in the way the film is composed, as well as providing a fascinating historical background and highlighting the subtle interplay between the characters that would escape the unobservant eye. Better still, play the documentary IMAGE: KUROSAWA'S CONTINUITY even before the commentary. This shows all of the 200 paintings that Kurosawa produced and fits them into their correct place in the narrative, providing a quick summary of the plot. Some have complained about the acting being cold and less demonstrative than in Kurosawa's earlier Samurai movies, but for me the reserve and self-control, the silences and the long takes, all added to the subtlety and psychological power of this film, and I was very happy to do without the hysterics that for me mar some sections of Seven Samurai.

Now to the 2nd question. It is unforgivable that Amazon should combine reviews on VHS tapes with those on orthodox DVDs and add them to genuine reviews of this Blu Ray version. Forget statements about this NOT being the full 180-minute copy. Ignore those who complain about a poor transfer. Pity those who tried to play the Blu Ray disc through a standard DVD player. This is a technically superb product in every way. The clarity is sharp, except where, as in the burial and dream sequences, Kurosawa deliberately softens the images. The subtitles are detailed and precise. Only the sound track is a disappointment. Most of the time there are no sounds beyond those of the humans and the elements, but there are supposed to be Noh drum rolls from time to time that carry important artistic significance. These and others were inaudible to me, and even the fateful flute melody preceding the shooting of Shingen could hardly be heard. The musical score, mercifully limited, is terrible  -- completely wrong, as if it drifted in from Hollywood during an airing of Star Wars.

My final word? Kagemusha or Ran? I prefer the former, but the two fully merit 5 stars and there is no commandment that states: THOU SHALLT NOT BUY BOTH.",1312070400,18,5275,4.863181312569521
344124,5,6301661737,"Hurrah for seeing double!  The kagemusha is almost as convincing as the great lord Takeda Shingen himself... or not... But this IS the entire story.  And what a great story it is too.  Yes the story telling style is inimitably Kurosawa, so expect some of the social customs to ""appear"" odd.  But even that is yet another aspect of the great theatricality in this movie.  The main characters are historically real people, part of the bloody 16th century Japanese history.  And technically the storyline follows very closely the actual historical events.  The booklet which accompanies the disk has a more detailed account of the historical period, as well as a number of the original drawings, costumes, set art etc (drawn by Kurosawa himself) used in the film.  The ""extras"" are a particularly worthwhile part of the disk. The story of how the film was almost NOT made is as interesting as the story of how the film was made.

The actual restoration and transfer to blu-ray is, as expected from Criterion, first rate.  Image and sound come together at a level of quality that would make Akira himself proud.  And he was not an easy man to work with.  All I can say is wow! And then say wow again!  Now go hunting for Ran.",1306281600,2,1221,4.623255813953488
344125,5,6301661737,"Kurosawa is the master of the visual, using light, color, motion to evoke magic on the screen. A lot of things in this period piece reminded me of Seven Samurai: warriors on horseback, the dramatic use of weather (wind & rain). In Kagemusha the banners flapping in the breeze is a motif that runs throughout the film. The elegant formal language and ritualistic manners are suffused with the essence of traditional Japan. The battle scenes, with large groups of mounted soldiers, were more epic in scope than the clashes between the seven samurai and the little band of outlaws, but the contrapuntal rhythms were similar.

The credits list Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas as producers of the foreign release. Donald Richie, who created the subtitles, describes how Kurosawa, rejected by Japanese producers, went abroad in search of support for his long-incubated film and found an enthusiastic audience in these two American admirers of his work. The music by Shinichiro Ikebe even reminded me a little of the Star Wars theme, especially in the final battle scene and its aftermath.

The story, which takes place in 16th century feudal Japan, is complicated and, as I think critic Vincent Canby states, hard to follow. Those with some knowledge of Japanese history will have an advantage.

Shingen Takeda is a warlord (daimyo), the leader of one of three clans (Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieasu are the others) that have formed an unsteady alliance. The other two band together against Takeda and he attacks their fortress, Noda castle in Kyoto. With their water supply cut off, Shingen hopes to overcome his enemies. His soldiers have heard a flute playing at night in the castle. Shingen decides that if the flute is not heard the next evening, he will attack. He takes up a position on the castle ramparts to listen for the flute and is shot by a sniper.

Shingen is seriously wounded, although his enemies do not know for sure if he is dead or alive. In order to keep them from finding out, and thus forestall an attack by rivals who fear Shingen, his clansmen recruit a condemned criminal who bears a remarkable resemblance to Shingen (played by Tatsuya Nakadai, who also plays Shingen) to be his double--his shadow. There is a precedent for this in that Shingen's brother has acted as his double in the past.

The wounded Shingen is concealed in a palanquin and taken to the Takeda mansion, where he soon expires. The double is installed in his place, with coaching from the clan elders. He has second thoughts when he discovers Shingen's remains in a large funereal urn, but is eventually persuaded to continue in the role.

The ruse is in danger of being exposed when spies from the other two clans observe a boat setting out through the early morning mist on Lake Suwa (where the Lord had requested to be interred) with the enormous urn containing Shingen's remains. They become suspicious, but the Takeda clan concoct a cover story.

The greater challenge is keeping his identity secret from Shingen's own household, since the news, if it spread beyond his inner circle of trusted counselors, would soon reach the Takeda clan's enemies. At first, Shingen's young grandson immediately spots the discrepancy, but he is gradually convinced that the double is really ojiisan (grandpa). Then, when kagemusha is brought to two of Shingen's concubines (or wives, I guess), he blurts out the truth. But they take this as a jest and react with laughter. One of the counselors makes excuses for him: the Lord is too enfeebled to sleep with either of his two favorites that night.

The double begins to identify with his role, growing fond of the little grandson, who explains the meaning of the characters on Shingen's banner (which becomes a leitmotif, appearing in the battle scenes):

hayaki koto kaze no goto ka
shizuka nado koto hayashi no goto ka
kazumeru koto hi no goto ka
ugokazaru koto yama no goto shi

Swift as the wind, quiet as the forest, fierce as the fire, immovable as the mountain.

By now the armies of Nobunaga and Ieyasu are advancing. The advisors hold a war council. The double is told to support the consensus of the advisors and leave the gathering. At the council Shingen's son Katsuyori asks him if he thinks they should attack or not. The double answers, as he believes the Lord would have, ""Do not move, a mountain does not move.""

Katsuyori is furious. He defies the council and attacks Takatenjin castle. The double sits through the battle calmly, inspiring his men to victory.

At last, however, the shadow's deception is exposed when he attempts to ride Shingen's horse and is thrown. The wives, rushing to his aid and seeing his uncovered torso, are shocked to discover that he does not have the Lord's familiar battle scar. The double is given an omiyage (a parting gift) and told to leave.

And now the truth will soon be known to the Tokugawa and Ieyasu forces.

Lord Katsunori, now the acknowledged master of the clan, orders an attack. While the kagemusha, now in rags, watches from the distance with a group of beggars, the Takeda soldiers meet with devastating defeat, and the closing scenes show the battlefield strewn with their bodies and those of their horses. The double wanders onto the scene for a last time and sees the carnage. He picks up a banner and tries to advance but is shot. He staggers to the river, where he sees the clan's flag with its emblematic slogan floating, and dies as he grasps the flag.

While Kagemusha may not rank among Kurosawa's greatest films (Rashomon, Throne of Blood, Ikiru, Seven Samurai) this is nonetheless a showcase of the director's genius. Reportedly, Kurosawa had a falling out with his mainstay star Toshiro Mifune, who had been intended for the part played by Tatsuya Nakadai. Nakadai is a monumental star in his own right. Whether or not Mifune would have been a better choice is a matter for speculation.

Regardless of which actors were chosen, Kagemusha is a must-see for lovers of Japanese cinema. Though it may be difficult to follow at times for American viewers because of the unfamiliar historical references, it is definitely worth the effort.",1304899200,,6149,4.829847908745247

The criminal does a fine job as the ""shadow warrior"" and eventually wins the hearts of Shingen's family, but hubris leads him astray, he is found out, and cast back into the world of peasantry.  In the end, the Takeda clan is defeated by Nobunaga.

Kagemusha is a film beautiful in parts but unsuccessful as a whole.  The sets and filmography are stunning and rich.  And the very long film can be watched easily because each scene is enchanting on its own merits.  However, as a single story, the film does not quite work.  One theme that characters reflect on several times is the challenge of continuously impersonating another person.  However, the film never explores this problem through the protagonist's experiences.  There is also the problem of the Battle of Nagashino, which takes up the last part of the film, but doesn't seem to have any relevance to the film per se, rather just the historical background.  Unlike RAN, which focuses on war and conflict, prolonged sequences here showing dead and dying soldiers in the aftermath of battle seem out of place.

My impression of Kagemusha is that Kurosawa had several pieces of visual imagery that he wanted to put on film (the dream sequence, the battlefield...), and he also wanted to tell the story of the shadow warrior as some sort of autobiography.  These got mashed up into one story with the consequent lack of complete success.  I suspect Kurosawa chose Shingen because of imagery of Shingen sitting solemnly, directing his troops, rather like a film director sitting behind a camera.  Kurosawa was a depressive, and I would bet that at times he felt his directing was somehow fraudulent like the shadow warrior pretending to direct Shingen's troops.

344221,4,6301661737,"Watching Akira Kurosawa's three hour long epic color film (his third) from 1980, Kagumusha (The Shadow Warrior) reminded me of the historical plays of William Shakespeare. While more famed for adapting the dramas of Shakespeare (Ran from King Lear, The Bad Sleep Well from Hamlet, The Hidden Fortress from Macbeth), Kurosawa's long film reminds me more of the detailed histories, where a single character is less important than the whole milieu (as well as being a more epic version of the old The Prince And The Pauper fable). And he succeeds very well at it. While the overall film is a bit too slow paced to be considered great, there is no doubt that it is an intricate work that abounds with astonishing color imagery, and is suffused in details that the screenplay by Kurosawa and Masato Ide slip in very subtly.
  The best example of this is that even though the average viewer will know next to nothing of Japanese feudal history (what little I knew came from mostly old Japanese films), specific details are not needed because the themes and characterizations are so universal. It won the Palm D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and was seen as a comeback film for Kurosawa, after a mostly forgettable decade (the 1970s) of sporadic film work.
  The actual story of the film is rather simple, the feudal lord of a clan that hopes to unite Japan in 1573, Shingen Takeda (Tatsuya Nakadai), is assassinated by a rival clan. However, since this takes place at night, the wounded lord has his generals prepare a double to take his place, should he die, and orders them to keep up the pretense for three years. We never see the actual shot, only hear it, and then see it in a re-enactment for the warlord, Ieyasu Tokugawa (Masayuki Yui), who ordered the assassination. The double is a thief, Kagemusha, played by the same actor, who during the opening six minutes of the film, before the credits, mocks the feudal lord and his brother as hypocrites for condemning him, a petty thief. He says they are mass murderers. The lord spares his doppelganger, the first of a number of fortuities in this story, loosely based upon real events. Nakadai is splendid in both roles. Usually, such dual roles are phoned in, but one can sense the difference in the two characters, even long after Shingen is dead....All in all, Kagemusha is a very good film, with some great scenes and moments. Unfortunately, its plot drags weigh it down just enough that it falls below some of his true masterpieces, like Seven Samurai, Ikiru, and The Bad Sleep Well. Yet, even if it is not Kurosawa at his best, like Shakespeare in second rate mode, it is still far superior to all but the very best of lesser filmmakers. Yet, in Kagemusha, as in few other films of quality, it is the very lack of specificity about its people and events- where such details float behind the presentation, throughout the film, then swiftly come together to make sense late in the work, that allows it to have such a lasting impact, narratively, just as its switch between surrealistic color sets and realistic location shots similarly recapitulates the viewers' disorientation, then realization that something very interesting and different has happened. That simply does not happen in Hollywood films, and rarely occurs in any films, at all.

344222,5,6301661737,"If you are into Kurosawa's battle war films, you will enjoy the epic drama of Kagemusha (Kawgaymoosha).  It is about illusion, deception, identity and tribal battle clans.  I believe there have been lengthier versions of the original film.  But it most certainly deserves a second viewing, as it can become confusing with doubles and flashback.  The scenes are lengthy and long shots are used, making it difficult to closely identify the characters.  The impressive costumes lend to the reality of the period.

Known as an epic drama, the film takes place in Japan during the 1500's.  The drama leads with the knowledge of a clan warlord killed and with the intent of surviving battle with the other clans, the death is covered up by a petty thief who bears a striking resemblance.  The thief becomes comfortable as the leader of the clan and then, onto defend his clan.  With that, you will see lengthy battle scenes.  Although, it remains confusing to me, battle scenes and Japan warlords are not really my type of film.  One needs time to absorb the depth of the film, especially with another viewing, and don't attempt to watch while sleepy.

Kurosawa's paintings!
During the Extras on the DVD, you will learn that in his frustration to get the movie financed, over a great time span to do so, while waiting, Kurosawa visioned how he wanted scenes to appear and he painted hundreds of storyboards.  The DVD comes with a booklet that details intricate information about the plot and it contains many sheets of the paintings!

You will also learn how Kurosawa relied on the aid George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola in bringing this masterpiece to the screen.  The interview with the pair is very insightful.  Also another excellent interview provides extensive details about the Master and making of the film.  To fully understand the warlords, clans, battles, nuances, etc, listen the film with the remarkable commentary.  ...Rizzo",1220572800,,1935,4.938080495356037

344224,5,6301661737,"Kagemusha is a great movie, and for my money it is more entertaining than  Ran. Kurosawa was trying to be too artsy in the latter film, which always puts me off just a little. Kagemusha tells the story in a more straightforward fashion, the acting is less exaggerated, and I think it's just more fun. However, what prompted me to review it was the visual quality, which I found a bit below what I'd expect from Criterion.

I saw the original shortened version in the theater when it was first released in USA. That was so long ago, memory won't allow me to compare with this Criterion DVD. However, the film, as noted by other reviewers, is a bit grainy. Nothing wrong with that. I like film grain, myself, as opposed to digitally smoothed visuals, which look less ""organic"" to me. The problem is that if you want to preserve accurately the whole visual character of the film, including the grain in the film, you need a lot of digital bits to do so. Kagemusha is three hours long. As a result, the average bitrate of the video on this DVD had to be shaved down somewhat. This leads to some ""artifacts"" of digital compression.

It is a small point, perhaps. But the lower bitrate does make the movie look slightly more grainy than it already is, due to digital compression. Perhaps you won't care, or even notice unless you watch on a high definition monitor, however the movie is not quite as sharp and clean as it could be.

My own preference would be for Criterion to have divided the movie in 2 parts on 2 DVDs, allowing the highest quality image possible. I don't think they quite achieved that goal with Kagemusha. Alternatively, Criterion could have applied more digital filtering to reduce the grain, and still put a three hour film on one disc.",1207785600,2,1753,4.537974683544304

Kurasawa's ""Seven Samurai"" left lasting memories and I wanted to see more of this great director's work.  The booklet giving background to Kagemusha was very helpful to me and I found the plot twist to be one that provoked further reflection in the days after I had watched the film.  It is one that I will keep and will watch again from time to time.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that the film has a number of relatively static set pieces, mostly associated with clan council meetings or the reception of emissaries.  There is a fascinating scene where an early ""sniper"" demonstrates an ingenious technique for setting up the fatal shot on which the plot turns.  At times the effect is a bit ""archaic"" and a bit reminiscent of one of the early Russian historic ""epic"" films about a Prince who defeats the Teutonic knights.

In addition, Kurosawa's painterly use of color (especially during several large-scale battle set pieces, for which he used five cinematographers) and his haunting, slow-motion dream sequences are simply unparalleled. Made with the help of George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, ""Kagemusha"" is a somber late masterpiece by one of the world's greatest filmmakers.",1183939200,3,748,5.747747747747748
344227,5,6301661737,"Now this is CINEMA!

The Criterion Collection DVD is filled with extras, from original Japanese documentaries and interviews of the departed Kurosawa (with English subtitles, if needed) and a booklet containing scene sketches

by the Master himself, which help you to understand why his movies are so poetic and his photography so masterful.

The movie is presented uncut and in its full splendor. The sound is just a conventional Stereo, which is probably the original soundtrack.

Pity, because if there had been a Surround division of the channels, some very spectacular battle scenes would have been more involving.

But perhaps, Akira Kurosawa wanted precisely that, to avoid the viewer to be distracted by the fluff, and rather concentrate on the story he is trying to tell.

Also known in the Western hemisphere as ""The Shadow Warrior"", this is truly an Epic picture with a very beautiful and touching storyline.

This picture is the true and natural tie to other Kurosawa movies like ""Seven Samurai"", ""Yojimbo"", ""Sanjuro"" and ""The Hidden Fortress"".

Unlike ""Throne of Blood"" (adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth) and ""Ran"" (adaptation of King Lear), both also masterpieces, ""Kagemusha"" is an original Japanese story and gives a thorough insight of Japan in the 17th Century.

I always tought that Criterion was just out to steal our hard-earned money just for its name, but after having now bought Akira Kurosawa's ""Ran"", the present ""Kagemusha"", as well as Luchino Visconti's ""The Leopard"", I will stick to Criterion like CA Glue.

Although pricey, it is through and through, money totally well-spent, for the quality in DVD rendition (very clean and sharp transfers), very acceptable sound, although some more work on this would be nicer, especially with more recent movies.

Criterion has really proven that quality has its own price and believe me, I have never seen ""Kagemusha"" and ""Ran"" the way I have watched them on my flatscreen LCD HD TV.

Going to the movies nowadays, with a technology like High Definition TVs, has totally become obsolete.

DVDs, when properly treated and produced can knock out any movie theater in the world.

Thank you Criterion for the work of love you put in remastering and transferring such classics on DVD, not to mention the tons of extras you include with them.

344229,5,6301661737,"Akira Kurosawa is arguably Japan's most prolific film maker. His creative inspirations have resulted in such classics as The Seven Samurai, Red Beard, Yojimbo, Sanjuro, and Ikiru. His films have seen many remakes, including The Magnificent Seven, Last Man Standing, and A Fistful of Dollars. Star Wars characters R2D2 and C3PO are based off of Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. In a time when film was being revolutionized by such directors as Bergman and Felinni, Kurosawa soon became the third treasure of film. While Bergman explored existential philosophical elements in such films as Wild Strawberries and The Seventh Seal (Kurosawa would later explore existentialism in Ikiru), Kurosawa was making ready use of his own major sets, talented actors, and vast storylines that soon earned him worldwide recognition. In a career that included nearly thirty films, Kurosawa became a legend.

Life, however, was not always easy for the film director Francis Ford Coppola soon called The Master. Kagemusha, or the Shadow Warrior, is a testament to that.

Kagemusha literally translated is Shadow Warrior. Other than a really neat title, it also means Replacement. Which is exactly what this film is, a kind of twisted Prince and the Pauper fable set in the Warring States time period in Japan. I won't go into details about the general storyline- I recommend you IMDB that or look into Amazon's own description, but I am going to attempt to remain as objective as I can be, in hopes of convincing readers to at least see the film without imposing too much of my own personal bias into the topic.

As was previously stated, Kagemusha is more than simply a film. To Kurosawa, it meant the return from a five year hiatus of depression and lethargy. I believe he even tried to commit suicide, though don't quote me. At this point, the seventy-four year old director was without funds, and his attempt at a comeback was easily refuted by every movie studio he approached with the screenplay for Kagemusha. After the flood of samurai and martial arts epic films in the 1960's and 70's, movie companies were burnt out on the samurai concept. Kurosawa was told the film would gross little or no money, despite the seal the film would have on it from the director who made samurai films famous. Dejected, Kurosawa seemed without any resources, until two unlikely film makers came to his rescue. Colleagues Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas loaned Kurosawa the million and a half dollars he needed to launch his film. Signing on as assitant producers, these two brought Kurosawa back into the spotlight, and can be accredited for having laid a foundational hand in helping the director regain enough prestige to soon after create two of his most well-known films, Ran and Dreams.

Now, the film.

The response from many critics on Kagemusha focuses around one summarization: is the film good? Beyond- it's wonderful. But is it one of Kurosawa's better? No. While Kagemusha is in itself a brilliantly done film, it doesn't seem to live up to the standard of other Kurosawa samurai films, such as Rashomon(Which was later remade as Hero) and Throne of Blood. Francis Ford Coppola even commented on this himself, saying it is very difficult for a director to reinvent themselves in a genre that they are familiar with. As to whether or not Kurosawa had done this with Kagemusha, Coppola had no answer.

What makes Kagemusha a brilliant film? To begin, the story is phenomenal. The description on the back of the DVD says it's a meditation on power, and in this respect I believe they were entirely correct. While Ran, which came after Kagemusha, deals with the ideas of power corrupting, and the results it may have on a family or kingdom, Kagemusha deals with obsession and the nature of power itself. It's entirely philosophical in approach, yet it follows the basic Kurosawa model: ""A good film must be interesting and enjoyable."" Enjoyable it is, as Kurosawa's artistic eye comes out in beautiful display. When the screenplay for the film was originally rejected, Kurosawa painted watercolors of all of the scenes he envisioned. Many scenes within the film appear to be mirrored creations of those ideas, a still painting come to life. At one point in the film the protagonist suffers from a nightmare in which he is trapped in a lake of blood. The setting for this dream sequence is in a gigantic model canvas of a painting all in red. Another scene involves a messenger running through courtyards of soliders. Each new courtyard's soliders are arrayed in different colors of armor (One courtyard's men are all in deep green, while another in dark purple, and yet another in fire red); later in the film, as the troops march to war, the colors almost seem to mesh into one of Kurosawa's paintings. This technique was later used in Ran, but in a wholly original style for each of the two films.

That's another aspect of Kurosawa's films that make them so enjoyable- very few of the storylines have any similarities to one another. The characters are always well developed, the stories themselves original. From the crime thriller Stray Dog to the poignant scenes of Madadayo, Kurosawa always manages to keep a streak of originality in his works. Even the philosophical themes are different in each one- compare Kagemusha's reflection on power to Throne of Blood's. Both deal with the same topic; however, their approaches are entirely different.

What, then, made Kagemusha less of an acheivement in the eyes of critics and viewers alike? I honestly couldn't tell you. Perhaps they were expecting the epic battle sequences that Kurosawa was famous for; there is entirely nothing wrong with that. Who wouldn't want to see a colored version of the fight with the bandits from Seven Samurai, or Toshiro Mifune as Macbeth watching a forest of spears come alive? With respects to Kurosawa, however, there was purpose in everything he did. A director as meticulous as The Master, especially in his later years, viewed all of the elements- sebtextual and on the surface- of his story with a close eye. People looking for the superbly epic bloody battles he was famous for would do well to view Ran or Yojimbo, and probably want to save Kagemusha for when they are in a more reflective mood. To all who refute this, I am not saying Kurosawa does not deal with war in the film. The whole movie's basic storyline focuses around war; however, it is the fighting that he lays off of. Consider why his battle sequences rarely take place in the daytime, or why they are so short (usually less than a minute in length). However, look and see why he spends nearly ten minutes simply filming a march, or another long sequence detailing the after effects of war and battle. Kagemusha, unlike Ran, does not deal with the glory of battle; rather, it reflects on the horrors of war. In many senses, Kagemusha seems to lay the foundation for Ran. Even the lead actor, who played the double in Kagemusha went on the play King Lear in Ran(You will have to forgive me, I am terrible with remembering the exact names. Ran, by the way, is King Lear set in fuedal Japan, with the three daughters changed to three princes instead. The same is true with Throne of Blood being Macbeth.)

Is Kagemusha worth seeing? Absolutely. By any standard it is a superb film. Is it worth buying? I thought so, but remember I am a major Kurosawa fan. People who do not enjoy foriegn films so much, or have not had good introduction to Kurosawa would be recommended to either see some of his more mainstream films, or watch with the knowledge that better Kurosawa works are out there.",1167609600,9,7631,4.832440703902066
344230,5,6301661737,"I have always liked the film ""Kagemusha"" ever since I watched it on the big screen. It is one of my favorite Kurosawa films. [And there are plently of his films I admire and have in my collection]. The films just an incredible watch, and I did not mind the length while viewing it in the theatre. Many have criticized that the film is too long, not so, it's terrific and every minute of the film is a treat to watch. The film is set in the 16th century, and centers on the Takeda clan, which was one of the three clans vying for control of Japan during the end of the feudal era.

Lord Shingen, wonderfully portrayed by (Tatsuya Nakadi), whose credits include 'RAN', and 'SWORD OF DOOM' to name just two films, does a wonderful portrayal as both Lord Shingen, and his double in the film. When Lord Shingen is wounded in battle, he orders all those in his court to keep quiet about his impending death, and that a 'Kagemusha' [Shadow Warrior] take his place for three years in order to prevent the demise of his clan, and the other enemy forces seeking control over Japan from taking over. His double is of course played by (Tatsuya Nakadi).

(Tatsuya Nakadai) is a petty criminal who is identical to the Lord Shingen. He was about to be executed, however, he is given a stay of execution as long as he does what he is told, and gives a performance of Lord Shingen, which everyone will accept. However, not everything goes as planned. The film is terrific, and the cinematography and set designs are incredible. This is not a fast action paced film, which many americans are used to, but a methodical and slow paced character study of the characters in the film. The nuances of the film are great, and as I wrote earlier, this is one of my favorite Kurosawa films, along with ""Ikiru.""

Upon his death, his kagemusha, or double (Nakadai again)--a lowly thief with a startling resemblance to the lord--takes over under the strict supervision of Shingen's closest associates.

This visually striking film explores the extent to which a person's identity is constructed by others.  The double begins to impress those around him as he seems to grow into the role, even winning the devotion of Shingen's grandson.  The man and his social position become blurred until it becomes unclear which is the real person.  When the double is unceremoniously humiliated and ejected from the palace toward the end, I could almost imagine that the rage of those who pelted him with stones was also repressed anger against the real Lord Shingen.  When the double witnesses the tragic fate of the Takeda clan at the end of the film, it is as if the ghost of Shingen himself has appeared to witness the end of all his dreams.

344262,4,6301661737,"I knew that Akira Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha"" (1980) had some basis in history, but I didn't know how much until I listened to this DVD's audio commentary by film scholar Stephen Prince (""The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa"").  According to Prince, virtually the entirety of the film's story is based on historical events -- the major exception being the character of the thief who acts as the double of Shingen, the warlord.  However, Shingen, a historical figure, had employed doubles in real life, so Kurosawa's fictionalizing of the title character isn't that much of an embellishment.

What makes Prince's commentary so outstanding is his in-depth knowledge of Japanese history.  The historical events chronicled in the film are well-known to a Japanese audience, but they're unfamiliar to the average Western viewer.  So, Kurosawa's often unconventional depiction of these events are frequently lost on non-Japanese audiences.  For example, according to Prince, the wounding by gunfire of Shingen as he listens to an enemy's flute marks a monumental event in Japanese history.  But Kurosawa portrays the event only in an oblique manner: by having the sniper who shot Shingen re-enact the shooting for Ieyasu Tokugawa (another historical figure, and the eventual winner of the wars that Kurosawa depicts).  Just imagine a film about Abraham Lincoln that dramatizes his assassination by having it re-created by Secret Service agents, and you'll get an idea of Kurosawa's inventiveness.

Prince discusses some off-screen historical events that were going on the same time as the incidents in the film, giving the listener a much broader understanding of both history and Kurosawa's accomplishment.  Also, Prince talks in depth about some of the artistic license that Kurosawa has taken with non-fictional events.  After listening to the commentary, I came away with a much deeper appreciation for ""Kagemusha.""

Since so much has already been said about the film itself, I will only add this: It's unfortunate that Shintar Katsu, who was originally cast in the title role and is best-known for starring in the Zatoichi film series, was fired by Kurosawa before filming began in earnest.  Tatsuya Nakadai, who replaced Katsu, is a superb actor, but his screen presence doesn't have the comic warmth that Katsu could have brought to the role -- and that I think would have enhanced the film.  (And at the risk of infuriating Nakadai fans everywhere, I would also prefer to have seen his lead role in Kurosawa's ""Ran"" played by Toshir Mifune.)  I can't watch ""Kagemusha"" without wondering how the film might have looked if Kurosawa and Katsu hadn't quarreled.  Otherwise, ""Kagemusha"" is among Kurosawa's best period films.

Even if you already own ""Kagemusha"" on tape, this Criterion DVD might be worth renting for Prince's commentary alone.

The film differs from Ran, the director's wonderful version of King Lear, in that it is a drama built around historical records and tradition. It is a compelling story that left me emotionally spent at the end.

The first time I watched the DVD, I played the Japanese audio track and read the English subtitles. This was not at all difficult, for the subtitles are clearly visible in all scenes. The second time through the DVD, I turned on the English commentary and watched the action on screen as everything was explained to me in marvelous detail.

The problem is that Kurosawa never knew how to direct actors, only scenes.  The fact that a number of excellent actors worked with Kurosawa and produced splendid performances (e.g. Takashi Shimura in 'Seven Samurai') had nothing to do with Kurosawa, but were more a happy accident.

He was not popular in Japan (where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded, hence the suicide attempt).

Incredible visuals and excellent production quality carry much of the movie; there are a few really great scenes, as can be expected of any Kurosawa movie.  But the second issue pushes this movie well into 4-star territory, and that is the ludicrous final battle.

This is the complete Japanese version, includes film not seen in the original US release.

Criterion has put together a great package, the quality of this DVD makes it worth the price. Crystal clear picture and sound, great packaging and graphics, awesome booklet. Included in the special features is a terrific commentary track, one of the best I've heard covering every aspect of the film, Kurosawa, Japanese history and Japanese film history.

Great story about a double filling in the shoes of Samurai Warlord Takeda Shingen. Shingen was a brilliant warrior and politican who still is very popular in Japan today. If not for his tragic early demise, he may have been the one to unify Japan as Shogun. Instead his death led to Nobunaga's rise and subsequently the rise of the Tokugawa shogunate which rule for 300 years. Japan may indeed be a very different place if it was a Takeda dynasty. It is still a mystery today way Shingen died.  Back to the film, it has pageantry, epic battles, action and drama galore, even if you hate a history lesson, the movie will hold you captive.

The only negative I could consider is its somewhat stagy, slow opening act...I loved this scene, especial since most of it was new to me (not in original U.S. release) but someone new to Japanese film might find it dull going and give up on the film before the momentum builds.

The shadow, reluctant at first in his new role, becomes the ""soul"" of the lord he's replaced, but he's eventually discovered and banished, and the clan is soon defeated.

Directed by Kurosawa, the movie is an interesting exploration of expectations and leadership. The color photography is exquisite, and the battle scenes - a Kurosawa specialty - are awesome: they are so huge in scope (the cast is enormous) and thrilling in execution that they almost wear us out just watching them. Long at 3 hours, the movie never drags.",1136592000,4,803,4.615384615384615

344293,5,6301661737,"This movie is based loosely on Japanese history during the Sengoku (Warring States) Period (mid 1500s to early 1600s) when powerful feudal lords (daimyos), each ruling their own domains in a fragmented Japan, fought each other for supremacy over the country.  Such samurai warlords included men like Takeda Shingen, Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa leyasu (the future shogun).  This film features all three of these giant figures of the Sengoku Period and focuses on an attempt by the leaders of Lord Shingen's Takeda clan to hide his sudden death.  Even though historians are not entirely sure on whether Shingen had died from a sniper shot or from illness, this film takes the former theory and moves on to telling another story in Kurosawa's distinctive style.  This film looks expensive with the showing of numerous extras as soldiers and horsemen, but Kurosawa's battle scenes are about formation and momentum rather than actual close-combat fighting.  Like in his other film RAN, this one focuses on the devastating effect of firearms on warfare and the self-destructive nature of war.  Like in RAN, an entire clan destroys itself by rushing into  an unnecessary attack.  Any director with a huge budget can make a big battle scene, but Kurosawa has a unique gift for making violence look grand and gruesome and yet dramatic and poetic at the same time.  Just love the scenes showing the great Oda Nobunaga and his warming to things western like red wine, Catholic missionaries, European armour and a feathered red hat.",1131753600,3,1518,5.04
344294,4,6301661737,"If you love Kurosawa's movies because of great characters and story line, this movie may disappoint you.  There are lots of characters but the story is difficult to follow.  Shintaro Katsu (the classic Zatoichi actor) was originally cast in the main role but due to arguements with Kurosawa he was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai.  This is good because while Katsu was fabulous as Zatoichi, you just can't picture him playing a feudal lord.  Nakadai is convincing.  As we was later in Ran.  The costumes are gorgeous and the scenery wonderful, but the story is not as crisp as Seven Samurai or as compelling as Ikiru.  But I still enjoyed the movie for all the other Kurosawa features, high winds, heavy rain, panoramic shots, great close-ups and costumes.  Nakadai is also wonderful in Sword of Doom, Yojimbo, Ran and Kill!.  Hara Kiri was too gruesome though his acting was good.  Also, the Criterion Collection versions are wonderfully done in DVD format.  I always look for their version if available.

344295,5,6301661737,Just amazing.  This is not for someone who looks for actions/fighting.  This is for someone who has an interest in Japanese culture and views storyline & character development as most important elements in the movie.,1126915200,6,216,5.142857142857143
344296,5,6301661737,"Kurosawa's beautiful film Kagemusha is a meditation on subjects that have haunted the director throughout his career in cinema: the doppelgager or double, (which brings to question identity and how identity is formed, and where identity is located; is it in appearance, world views, actions, attitudes or loves? How does individual choice create a man? What if one's choices were different?) transformation (all Kurosawa heroes go through a transformation) the tragedy of war (note the elegaic images of horses struggling in death throes in the aftermath of the massacre at the film's conlcusion) and despair (Kuroswa has investigated despair as few other filmmakers have...from The Lower Depths and Stray Dog to Ran, many of his films meditate deeply on human hearts without hope).

I cannot help but think that Kagemusha's deep feeling comes from the autobiographical: a man (the thief, played by Tatsuya Nakadai) must assume the role of the Lord (or, why not...they say it in the film...""Tenno""...or Emperor...used to describe Kurosaw himself).

Kuroaswa must have wondered, in his time of financial difficulty, after the dismissal of ""Dodes-Kaden"", after his suicide attempt, after losing his status, during his struggles to find financing for Kagemusha...he must have thought about what it is to assume a role of great authority, and to be dismissed from the role that gave his life meaning.

Tatsuya Nakadai being ejected forcibly from the castle...retainers throwing clods of mud and stones after him, like a stray dog being pelted and driven from the gates of a house...maybe Kurosawa felt that this is how his life had been. He has said, ""I am afraid that me minus movies equals nothing"". His identity, so involved in the creation of film, in making his meditations and dreams communicated through the medium of film, and the life that grew up around the creation...the friendships, the experiences, the world of making that makes a world...it must have been horrible for him to realize how fragile and easily shattered that world could be!

Federico Fellini once said in an interview that criticism felt somehow impertinent...that his work was a reflection of who he was as a human being, and to judge one's work seemed an insult. I remember this as I think about Kagemusha and the other films of Akira Kurosawa. It is with great humility that I approach my thinking about these films, and would refuse, even if forced, to rank them. That really would be impertinent, and an insult to a life dedicated to the highest good an artist can achieve: an honest look at human experience with the intent of understanding the mysteries of the human heart.",1125014400,11,2656,5.057077625570776
344297,4,6301661737,"Believe it or not, even though the film is 180 minutes, I was hoping it would just keep going.  Kagemusha is such a depressing movie, but it's also so good!  The only problem (which the commentators note) is the music as it's too ""Hollywood"" for the setting of the movie.  But that's a minor point.  I've enjoyed everything by Kurosawa and Kagemusha is one of the better films.  Of his later colour samurai films, if you had to choose between Ran and Kagemusha, Ran is by far the superior film - and from what I've read Kurosawa would agree.

Still, the extras make this package extra nice.  And just so you know, the essay by Donald Richie is not the same as the one in Mr. Richie's book on Kurosawa (also available on Amazon).  So once again, Criterion delivers an exceptional package!",1124755200,,787,4.492957746478873
344298,3,6301661737,"I had Kagemusha for several years on VHS, before going exclusively DVD. I remember Kagemusha as one of Akira Kurosawa's best movies, in my opinion, second only to Throne of Blood. I was awaiting the delivery of

the Criterion edition of this movie with great excitement. It was a letdown.

Be warned that this is the mutilated Francis Ford Coppola version, and not the original one!

Almost the whole magnificient battle at the end of the movie has been cut. As it is not violent by today's standards, one can wonder why? And while the quality of the movie is OK, I had expected it to be much better.

One can only hope that one day Kagemusha will be issued in a complete version, so we can watch this movie in all it's splendour, and the way Kurosawa wanted it to be.",1121040000,35,768,4.387323943661972
344299,5,6301661737,"Over a decade before Akira Kurosawa received funding to shoot Kagemusha he pondered the idea of multiple identities and how different personalities appear in different situations. This notion was in a mere stage of a fetus around the time when he finished Red Beard (1965), but the film left Kurosawa marked as damaged goods due to his oppressive perfectionism.  After this no one in Japan was willing to back him financially, but he did not give up as he attempted to create a production company with three other prominent directors from Japan.  He made the brilliant Dodesukaden (1970), but it was a commercial flop that ended his production company.  This was the ultimate death for his professional career in Japan, but through Hollywood he began to work on Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970).  However, he left the project due to artistic discord, which tarnished his reputation even more.  His life came to the ultimate bottom in December 1971 when he tried to commit suicide.

As the Phoenix raised from the ashes, Kurosawa emerged from spiritual death when the Soviet Union invited him to make a film, Derzu Uzula (1975), which went on to win the Oscars for the Best Foreign film in 1976.  After the Oscars in 1976 to the shooting of Kagemusha in 1979, Kurosawa returned to his roots as a painter where he amassed a large number of paintings while being immersed into Shakespeare and Japanese history.  Kurosawa's paintings became advance storyboards for scenes in the film, which is loosely adapted from Shakespeare's King Lear and historical events from 16th century Japan.  This occurs as his story of multiple identities and personalities slowly brewed into perfection at his final stage as a film director.

Kagemusha opens with the line, ""Hmmm, he looks like me."", as the camera reveals three characters all having the same appearance.  In this lengthy introduction, the stationary camera reveals through minimal movements of the characters and the ongoing conversation that two of them are brothers and high ranking officials while the third is an unrelated thief.  The only thing giving away that the thief is a fake is his body language and his facial expression, but when he opens his mouth it is evident who are the leader and the thief.  Nonetheless, the similarities between them are striking in both their appearance and their lifestyle, but what makes the difference between them is that one of them holds the power of the province in which both live and he intends to use the thief as a body double.

Shingen Takeda (Tatsuya Nakadai) and his brother Nobukado Takeda (Tsutomu Yamazaki), who took the thief as a double, are amidst a war trying to conquer the whole Japan in order to bring peace and no more bloodshed to the nation.  Shingen are currently besieging a castle, as they intend to strengthen their position to achieve complete peace.  During one late evening when the Shingen listens to one of the men playing a flute, a sniper injures him severely.  This causes the opponents of Shingen to wonder whether he is injured or dead, as he eventually dies.  However, before he died he made sure that they would keep it a secret for three years before revealing his death.  Throughout this time the thief, Kagemusha, becomes the stand-in ruler for the clan while they try to maintain their geographical position for three years.

Some reviews have complained about the slow pace and the length of Kagemusha.  However, the length is necessary in order for the audience to completely immerse into the cinematic artistry that Kurosawa tries brings to the viewer through his ceaseless determination to create an experience.  Sure, one could kill time, as Jean-Luc Godard puts it in Band of Outsiders (1964) where the characters try to run through the Louvre in less than 10 minutes. However, the purpose of visit to the Louvre is not to merely for being able to say that one has been there.  Instead, it is highly recommended that one tries to take the time to understand what the artist attempts to say in each artistic work by pausing and reflecting over what they see.  Kagemusha offers a wealth of artistic images drawn from paintings that go beyond colors and lines, which compels further introspective contemplating work on self and society.  Thus, if the audience, expects to merely experience a sword fighting samurai film, Kagemusha will truly be a disappointment.

An intertesting hypothesis could provide the notion that Kurosawa displays several of his own characteristics through his paintings, which later appeared in scenes throughout Kagemusha.  For example, there is the oppressive leader who demands perfection at all costs to the unwelcome thief.  Another interesting notion could be drawn from Shakespeare's King Lear where the king steps down from his position as king to later realize that it was a bad decision, as he is betrayed by his own daughters.  Then there is Gloucester who tries to help Lear, but is accused of treason and left to wander the countryside blind who also attempts suicide, but is saved.  The story of King Lear eventually ends up in tragedy, as does Kagemusha.  Maybe Kurosawa used King Lear, as analogy to his own life, not knowing the end.  This occurs as Kurosawa ultimately brings together all aspects of himself - past, present, and future.  Yet, as mentioned, he did not know his future, he went on to make and direct four more films including the masterpieces Ran (1985) and Dreams (1990).",1119139200,6,5456,4.927868852459016
344300,4,6301661737,"Set during the 16th century when Warlords ruled Japan, ""Kagemusha"" focuses on the ruler Lord Shingen (Tatsuya Nakadai)leader of the Takeda clan who has held chaos and his enemies at bay for decades. His land is prosperous and doing well. When he's killed by a sniper, Shingen's brother proposes putting a double who has an uncanny resemblence to Shingen in the hopes of keeping the rival clans from invading and ousting the ruling Takeda clan out. He uses Shingen's last wish as his excuse to bring in this double a petty thief (Nakadai as well); Shingen insisted that no one be told of his death. Unfortunately, his enemeis do hear rumours of his death and they send spies in to confirm whether or not he is dead. Suddenly, the ""shadow warrior"" is thrust into the limelight and must lead the clan against their enemies.

 A staggering and stunnning epic Kurosawa's film benefits from the fact that he painted and sketched out many of the major scenes for the film over a four year period while he waited for financing for this major project. A warning to those expecting a ""Die Hard"" style action film; the action set pieces are stunning and brilliantly realized as only Kurosawa could do but like many of his films Kurosawa let's the story unwind at a leisurely pace. The first hour sets up the final hour and forty minutes.

Painstakingly remastered using a restored high definition digital transfer, ""Kagemusha"" hasn't looked this good since it was originally released and I doubt that many prints were as free of dirt and debris as this version which was run through a digital filter to clean it up. There's a fine audio commentary by Stephen Prince author of ""The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa"". Prince has some very interesting insights into Kurosawa's world and that of Japanese cinema. The subtitles are much improved and easier to read as well. There's also a 48 page book featuring paintings, sketches and an interview with Kurosawa around the time of this film's release from SIGHT & SOUND magazine. There's also an excerpt from a book by Japanese film historian Donald Richie and a new eassay by film scholar Peter Grilli discussing the film and the difficulty Kurosawa had in getting the film made.

The second disc features a number of great extras. There's a brand new interview with Goerge Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola discussing how they got involved in financing Kurosawa's epic film. They basically got Fox involved as distributor and co-financer with Toho studios so that Kurosawa could get it made. Ironically, both met Kurosawa but found out that the director needed financing from a third party as the director didn't feel he knew them well enough to ask for their help. There's also a 40 minute documentary on the making of the film entitled ""Akira Kurosawa: It Is Wonderful to Create"". There's also a wonderful supplement that runs about 45 minutes using Kurosawa's original paintings, sketches and drawings reconstructing much of the film showing how closely the final film matched his original paintings. Finally we get the original teasers and trailer for the film (there are on the first disc) along with a comparison between storyboard and finished film sequences.

Overall a first rate presentation from Criterion and well worth the investment. I'm looking forward to their eventual release of ""Ran"" Kurosawa's last epic masterpiece on DVD. Nobody could interpret Shakesphere as well as Kurosawa.",1118880000,6,3447,4.946459412780657
344336,4,6301661737,"I first saw this film on VHS and was delighted when it came out on DVD, especially in a Criterion edition.

All right, it is slow in parts as the basis of the switch is spelled out, but then a rapid decision would be not in keeping with the period of the movie. You become immersed in the time period of the 16th Century.

I feel the quality of the print is first rate, and if one compares the visual look of the preview trailer to the presented film, the difference is clear.  Ironically, the Japanese trailers and teasers are visually crisp.

My greatest memory from having seen the VHS version was the final battle scene and the futility of it all.  Swords and spears against muskets is not a good match-up.  This is not a battle scene in the spirit of The Wild Bunch, so one gets the horror of the battle through visual looks of the spectators rather than the carnage on the field, although the aftermath of the battle is clear as to the terror of the battle.  I am glad Kurosawa chose not to make it a 'splatter' scene.  It was if the Generals could not believe what was happening and could not adapt.  The empty stools after the battle are more telling than any battle scene could be.

This is a movie in the manner of great epics.  They surely don't make this type of movie anymore, except on computers.  The visuals are sweeping, and all of it with real people and horses.  To think that the warriors were sent into battle with large flags attached to poles on their backs is amazing, and a visual feast.

Added:  I recently had the chance to re-watch the film, and the commentary, which made it much more enjoyable, as the contrast was made between the full length Japanese version, and the truncated American version.  The Criterion edition has the full version.",1116979200,5,1772,4.422839506172839
344337,5,6301661737,"After seeing some of Kurosawa's early film classics I had high expectations for this later color film. To my surprise, the film turns out to be one of his best! The gorgeous cinematography and its striking approach to detail and composition place it in my list of greatest films. Criterion has done a great job - well worth the price of admission. The film also sparked some interest in me in the history of Japan and the life of Shignen.",1116115200,6,438,4.4875
344338,4,6301661737,"At this point in Kurosawa's career, he's completed the vast majority of his work, excluding Ran and Dreams, and one might think he'd tire.  However, he chooses not too and puts this epic film on with the early vigor of his earlier films.

Kagemusha is set in 16th century Japan, where control can be easily won or lost, but is rarely held on to for long.  Yet, one emperor Shingen has managed to do so until his later years, only to be taken away by a sniper.  Yet Shingen was revered, and asked that his death be hidden to keep his people's morale up, and his enemies safely away.  This is a decent plan, but when the double starts feeling the conflictions of his new self and former the chances diminish.  Plus, enemies are ever threatening and questioning the truth, even family connections.

Sounds exciting, and for three hours it does have many fine moments, which I purport to be well worth the film.  Sure, the film is slow as many Kurosawa's can be, but this is part of Japanese culture anyways, and thus adds to the overall, although one might need to remind themselves of that fact.

For those not use to Kurosawa there's always the battle scenes, but the deeper conflicts is imbedded in the double (played by Tatsuya who also plays the emperor.)  This double once was a thief, and in a near prince and the pauper fashion rose up, or ""acted"" as if he was great.

Overall, I understand that many for good or bad reasons no longer feel the prevalence of Kurosawa's films, as I have trouble to do with some.  Still though, this one as recent and enduring as it is may still reach those yet, as the film is meant to.",1115769600,,1623,4.409395973154362
344339,3,6301661737,"I love Akira Kurosawa but to be honest, I wasn't impressed at all with this movie.

The plot is interesting & builds in excitement until it reaches about 2 hours into the movie & then it becomes exhausting and tedious to watch until the ending battle scene which I thought was disappointing & anticlimactic.

The ending battle scene may have been historically accurate but instead Kurosawa should have awarded his viewers with some nice hand to hand combat between Samurai. It's like all those extras weren't put to good use.

Pretty much all of the battle scenes in the movie consisted of arquebuses mowing down Samurai.

This may have been historically accurate for the time period but it doesn't make for good entertainment.

I would much rather see the Samurai hacking off limbs with Naginatas or shooting arrows at each other.

The hundreds of extras were not used effectively in my opinion!

The plot was fictional, so Kurosawa should have thrown in some fictional battle scenes as well.

Unfortunately, the lack of battle scenes also hurts the movie.

If I remember correctly, there were about 3. Two very short ones not worth mentioning & then the ending battle scene.

Adding at least 2 more battle scenes of good quality would have made the film more watchable.

Action has a magical quality of enticing the viewer back into the movie. (especially after long periods without any action)

This wasn't used effectively in Kagemusha.

The plot is good but it just isn't enough to carry the viewer through the entire movie alone. It needed more action to go with it!

On a positive note, the Cinematography is excellent & probably the best I've seen in any Kurosawa movie. Possibly the best in any movie period. That actually disappoints me in a way because the great cinematography could have been much more enjoyable if the battle scenes were of the same quality.

But if the lack of Battle scenes doesn't bother you, then you'll probably love this movie. It's rich in color & history.

The acting was also very well done & so was the costume design.

My opinion is that it's worth a rental to see for the first time & if you like it, then buy it. The DVD version has cool special features.

I would also recommend ""RAN"" or ""Chushingura"".

Chushingura also suffers from the ""not enough battle scenes syndrome"" as Kagemusha but it's plot is still great & so is the final scene where the 47 ronin raid the castle.",1114905600,6,2419,4.703087885985748

344342,5,6301661737,"KAGEMUSHA is the great 1980 drama involving a clan of 16th-Century Japanese warlords who want to deceive their enemies by having a common thief impersonate their murdered leader.  This is a thought-provoking film about reality and illusion, as well as a visually inviting work filled with many striking scenes and compositions that Kurosawa films are known for.  A memorable 6-minute opening shot of three identical-looking men, an elaborate dream sequence, and a harrowing montage of the aftermath of the final battle are among some of Kurosawa's finest moments in his long film career.  Lead actor Tatsuya Nakadai was only in his 40s when he made KAGEMUSHA, playing a much older man and effectively conveying the guile and conflicted feelings of the imposter.  Nakadai would also play the lead role in Kurosawa's next film, RAN, 5 years later, again unrecognizably playing a much older man.

Criterion has released the definitive video edition for KAGEMUSHA: a Region-1, 2-disc DVD of the uncut, 180-minute version of film.  The anamorphic widescreen video quality is generally very good, except for some occasional graininess.  The original Japanese audio is in Dolby Digital 4.0 surround (3 front, and 1 mono rear channels), although surround effects are infrequently used.

The best supplement on the disc is Stephen Prince's full-length audio commentary, which, due to the film's length, is able to elaborate on many topics in great details.  Much of Prince's narration (I would say half of it) is more on the historical background of the film's period than the filmmaking and art of the film.  He compares certain plot details against historical facts to show how Kurosawa uses his artistic license to convey his own ideas.  Regarding the film itself, he emphasizes that this is an atypical Kurosawa film in that its hero tries to conform to the prevailing social order, unlike the nonconformist rebels and outcasts in past films such as SEVEN SAMURAI or YOJIMBO.  On the film's artistry, he observantly points out that in a film about illusions, many of the key events in the plot are aptly NOT shown on screen.  He also provides a great analysis on Kurosawa's most elaborate dream sequence.

Prince also does a good job of pointing out the differences between the shortened, 162-min international version and this 180-min uncut version.  The longer version does not have ""20 minutes of footage involving Kenshin Uesugi"", as misreported at IMDB.  The added scenes are, in fact, merely short, trimmed scenes and shots that are sprinkled all over the film.  They add to the overall continuity, without altering anything in the main plot line.  A majority of the added scenes are just too trivial to mention or to even notice.  The few noteworthy ones include a much longer montage of the aftermath of the final battle, and a wholly added scene where the fake Shingen is being examined by the Jesuit priest physician -- this scene also has the great Takashi Shimura's only appearance in the film, seen for the first time on this DVD by viewers outside of Japan.

For Kurosawa fans, the second best feature on the disc is perhaps the collection of impressionistic paintings by Kurosawa that were later used by him as storyboards for the film.  In a 41-minute segment called ""Image: Kurosawa's Continuity"", hundreds of such paintings are shown, accompanied by sound clips from the films.  In a still gallery section called ""A Vision Realized"", there are about 20 of the paintings placed side by side with still photos from the film.  Many of these same paintings are also reprinted on the 45-page booklet that comes with this DVD.

The booklet also include 3 wonderful essays.  As is usually the case, Criterion took the effort of including different writings that don't duplicate one another.  One essay deals with the film itself, its art and its history.  Another one is a Sight-and-Sound interview with Kurosawa.  The third one covers Kurosawa himself biographically.

The disc also comes with a well-made 41-minute making-of documentary that is comprised of mostly interviews, stills, and clips from KAGEMUSHA.  It's part of a 2003 series called ""Akira Kurosawa: It is Wonderful to Create"" (other episodes of this series are available on Criterion DVDs of IKIRU, THE LOWER DEPTHS, and STRAY DOG).  In Japanese with optional English subtitles, it has interview segments of the cast and crew, including Kurosawa, Nakadai, Kota Yui (the child actor, who is now grown up), and others.  They recount the challenges they faced, the artistic and technical choices they made, and a few amusing anecdotes.

Also included are trailers, a few whiskey commercials Kurosawa made on the set of KAGEMUSHA (other than the monetary reasons for which they were made, there is nothing special about these commercials), and a 20-minute interview segment with George Lucas and Francis Coppola, who praise Kurosawa's genius and lament that the film business often doesn't accommodate non-commercial films, even those by great directors.",1113004800,91,5022,5.115196078431373
344343,4,6301661737,"The colors in Akira Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha"" re-emerge bold and saturated on this DVD, with images bordering on hyper-realistic. The 1970s film stock retained a fair amount of grain, but it's rendered harmless by the raging colors. Wear is at a minimum, limited to some speckling and spotting. The film unspools letterboxed at an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (with enhancement for 16x9 monitors). The stereo sound is as good as it gets with a foreign film of this age. The taiko drums roll out just like thunder while the rush of hooves fills the listener's room.

Stephen Prince, commentator on the Wellspring DVD of ""Ran,"" the director's other color epic, gets the nod again on ""Kagemusha."" The author of the Kurosawa book ""The Warrior's Camera"" repeats the feat of lecturing with authority and verve throughout the lengthy feature. Prince points out where most of the cuts were made for the shortened U.S. version of the film, accurately calling the complete presentation found on the Criterion DVD ""a richer and more organic presentation.""

""Kagemusha"" works on a surface level as a take on illusion and reality, but those wise enough to dig deeper will need Prince's help. The commentator provides the historical orientation that Kurosawa rushed past, baffling his foreign audiences.

Disc 2's extras lead off with exec producers George Lucas and Francis Coppola looking back on Kurosawa and ""Kagemusha"" in 19 minutes of interviews filmed last year. Kurosawa captured violence in a ""poetic surprising way"" that schooled the young American directors of the 1970s, Coppola says. ""You could trace a line backwards from `The Godfather' to `Bonnie and Clyde' to Kurosawa,"" he says. The Japanese director ""always had a great story to tell,"" Lucas adds.

Some of Kurosawa's 200-some storyboards for the film reappear on the DVD in a split-screen comparison with finished scenes. In a fun extra, Coppola clinks glasses with Kurosawa in an odd TV ad for Suntory whiskey, a pitch clearly ... lost in translation. A 40-minute episode of the Kurosawa documentary series ""It's Wonderful to Create"" runs down the story of the production, in which the director stunned local fans by firing his popular star, Shintaro Katsu of ""Zatoichi"" fame. (Katsu dared to bring his own film crew to the set on day 1.)",1113004800,5,2286,5.0557029177718835
344344,3,6301661737,"Being a big fan of Asian cinema and Japanese history, I have longed to view Kagemusha.  I guess all the waiting, hampered my expectations.  This piece takes place prior to the reign of the Tokugawa period when clans were all battling for control.

When Lord Shingen of the Takeda clan dies, the clan quickly substitutes a double to take his place and fool the country of the truth.  The double has to convince even his close relations that he is the real thing, otherwise word may spread and other clans will take advantage of the situation.

This movie is one of Japanese most famous directors, Akira Kurosawa, biggest pieces.  It was supported and co-produc

ed by George Lucas (Star Wars fame) and Francis Ford Coppala (famous American director).  It was Akira's movies from the 60's that inspired American movies such as STAR WARS, Magnificent 7, and a long list of Western movies.  You definitely can see the western influences in the magnificent Kurosawa movie, The Seven Samurai.

Back to the movie at hand, I was disappointed.  The movie, very beautifully shot with scenery and provided with intelligent dialogue has been weakened by one thing; pace.  This movie has an incredibly and brutally slow pace to it.  It is a movie running at 3 hours which could have easily been 1/2 the length and still achieved its goal.  The acting is superb, characters are amply developed, even though the focus is mainly on 1 person (the double), scenery is spectacular, dialogue is well written, but in the end it just is too long.  There really is no reason to justify its length, not even the ""artistry"" factor can.

In the end, all the great movie aspects are there, just stretched out too far.

344345,4,6301661737,"By using real historic characters like the renowned Takeda Shingen, Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu, Kurosawa proves once more that life is usually more dramatic than fantasy, as he recounts the substitution of Shingen with a double during the ""golden-age"" of Japan's civil wars in 16th century. The characters are very well presented, there are some fine scenes in this colored film like that of Shingen's double galloping in front of the Takeda army during an inspection, under the eyes of the enemies' spies, or that of the sad field of battle of Nagashino where the Takeda clan was finally destroyed, but Kurosawa has streched the film a little bit longer than necessary, putting more than enough combat scenes in it.

Beautifully shot in color, Kagemusha tells the story of the Takeda clan during the civil war period of Japan's feudal era.  The head of the clan, Takeda Shingen, was considered the greatest general of his time.  His presence alone kept the other great warlords at bay, namely Oda Nobunaga, the man eventually credited with uniting Japan.  Mortally wounded in battle, Shingen commanded that his death be kept a secret, and his clan not move from its' mountain stronghold for three years.  His double, or Kagemusha, was a common thief.  His character arc, as it moves from common criminal to eventual warlord and tragic fall is magnificent.

To simply label Kagemusha as a practice movie for Ran is an injustice (though accurate).  If you have any interest in samurai films of feudal Japanese pieces, you won't be disappointed.",1102896000,5,1045,4.820224719101123

I am Amazon user in Japan and already own the original LD release and huge, expensive DVD boxes(cost me about $1,0000.....), and I can assure you that this Criterion version will be ""THE BEST"" one.

While Japanese version was created from same new Hi-Definition transfer, all features, three-hour movie and 45minits documentary, are bundled in dual-layered disc, which is too much to take in one, and the sound bit rate is 338kbps instead of 448kbps.

I expect, likewise ""Red Beard"",""Hidden fortress"" and ""Ikiru"", one disc will be devoted to the feature presentation and the extra to the other disc on Criterion version so that the quality can be maximized, and can be better than original Japanese release.

Still, among the Japanese original box set, I can say that the quality of ""Sansiro Sugata"" and two-disc set of ""Seven Samurai"" are great. I can't wait to see what the folks at Criterion will do to the rest of Kurosawa film releases.

344395,5,6301661737,"Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha"" is a complicated film, and sometimes difficult to like.  Kurosawa's preference for long shots and medium shots over closeups, very little cutting in dialogue scenes, and long pauses make for a slow, deliberate pace.  It often feels like we're watching bits of story happening in real time; this applies to the battles as well.  But these are not deficiencies.  The pace (similar to the later ""Ran"") gives the film an almost meditative quality that you might not expect given the war setting.  ""Seven Samurai"" it certainly is not, but it is well worth the effort.

This film contains what is, to me, one of the single most beautiful images I've seen in film.  At sunset, two solders of the Takeda clan are discussing whether Shingen has been killed.  The image is only in silhouette against a blazingly orange-red sky, with the air full of dust as a long procession of soldiers and cavalry slowly marches by.  Beautiful.

The Criterion edition of this film is Kurosawa's original full-length version, not the shorter international version previously available on VHS and laserdisc in the USA.

344437,5,6301661737,"The backdrop of the story is Sengoku Japan where the daimyos of great clans vie with one other for supremacy. The ultimate goal is to become shogun to replace the now powerless Ashikaga of Kyoto. At the center of the tale is Shingen, lord of the Takeda clan, a warlord of surpassing skill, who strikes fear in the hearts of his enemies and inspires bravery and undying loyalty in his own men. Shingen is at the apex of his power, his armies threaten to crush Tokugawa Ieyasu the chief ally of his implacable foe, Oda Nubunaga. However, in an irony of fate, Shingen is mortally wounded. Shingen, along with his chief retainers are well aware that his death not only signals an end to his aspirations to crush the Tokugawa and Oda clans and to declare a Takeda shogunate, but also that it might, in fact, lead to the destruction of the Takeda clan under the leadership of his intemperate son, Katsuyori. So, a plan is devised to use a kagemusha (shadow warrior) to keep the enemies of the Takeda in check for three years (the significance of the period in question is never explained). The film is a visual masterpiece, Kurosawa has an equally good eye for epic as well as ordinary moments. Human bonds (and, perhaps, bondage) are at the heart of the story. A petty thief is torn and hollowed by having to assume the outward persona of a larger than life figure. In time his misery is comforted by the love of a child and, for a moment, he forgets... The destruction of the Takeda army at Nagashino is the predictable result of the revelation of Shingen's death. The kagemusha now half man, half ghost, watches in horror as warriors and horses are cut down; he watches their death throes and his remaining hold on a sense of self is finally lost in that danse macabre.

Kurosawa's choice of putting real historical figures in a stylized and mythical tale is somewhat problematical. It creates a number of creative constraints, while, nevertheless, taking liberties with the historical record. Regardless, it is a great movie, one that, in a number of ways, anticipates Kurosawa's final triumph, the sublime Ran.",1097625600,2,2109,4.684636118598383
344438,3,6301661737,"As I watch more & more Akira Kurosawa's movies, it comes to my realisation that in actuality, his works are rather Noh-influence.  His scenes are perfectly framed & yet, the frames are expansive enough for his performers to do what they meant to do.  I used to think that the performances are somewhat pushed but as as we have a tendency to be mellowed by age, as I watch the movie second time around, I am pleasantly surprised that the outcomes aren't what I think they used to be.  The performers do what they meant to do in their own natural rhythms & together with a glorious settings (where everything seem to be right where they are), with dosages of old Japanese values, whallah, you have a concoction of Kurosawa movies that we are endeared to.  Kagemusha is based upon the true story during the Warring Period between three factions.  Fighting scenes are at best patchy but it's still an awe-inspiring site as most of what we have these days are all CGI effects.  Kurosawa's movies tend to touch upon death, our mortality, the fragile beauty of life.  As war rages on, the scene of soldiers coming to a standstill listening to the haunting sound of a solo flute performance is at once poignant and beautiful at the same time.  There are moments like that in Kagemusha.  It's also a life in parody as the shadow warrior, a non-blood would have done so much better than the original warlord's own son, whose impatience would eventually lead his Takeda Clan to imminent doom.  A movie not to be missed especially for a Kurosawa's fan.  Mind you, this movie would eventually be superseded by Ran, which I feel is his work in maturity particularly for this form of epic war genre.  Highly recommended.",1094947200,3,1705,4.627906976744186
344439,5,6301661737,"Like several others who have reviewed this movie for Amazon, I too prefer Kagemusha to Ran.  The story is more intriguing and unusual, and the movie asks several of the ""big questions"" of life:  What does it mean to be a leader?  Can anyone truly KNOW another person, even if you are very close to them?  Does personality or individuality matter, or is form what matters? Is there any value in war when everything is laid to waste in the end?  This is one of my favorite films of all time, it is somewhat long by American standards, but it is very absorbing and beautiful.  I consider it a much greater and more subtle achievement than Ran.",1091750400,3,640,4.427350427350428
344440,5,6301661737,"Comparing Kagemusha with Ran is a thread that runs through many of the reviews. Both are dramas centered around warlords during Japan's feudal era, and were directed by Kurosawa late in his career. Both films are visually stunning, but there are differences in how the stories are presented. Ran seems affected by its self-conscious adaptation of King Lear, and has a more theatrical (and less cinematic) feel about it. The acting is very stylized, as if in adapting Shakespeare's play Kurosawa also wanted to reaffirm the Japanese qualities through similarities to traditional ritualistic Noh dramas.
  The story of Kagemusha seems more of a natural portrayal in comparison. The loyalty of the thief to the warlord is perhaps a quintessentially Japanese story, and is beautifully evoked in many small scenes throughout the film. It is the battle scenes which are highly stylized in this film, as they serve to illustrate the changing fortunes of the clans, and are not centerpieces. They are a part of the amazing beauty of the film's images. One of my favorite images of all the films I have seen is that of the warlord's unhappy son plotting in a traditional room, while in the background we can see the blue of a lake being whipped up by a storm.
  Some people will prefer Ran, and others will like best Kurosawa's earlier and more earthy films, such as Yojimbo. They are all wonderful, but for myself Kagemusha is his crowning achievement.",1082160000,8,1444,4.905737704918033
344441,5,6301661737,"I actually prefer Kagemusha to Ran. My Japanese language University teacher used to gripe that Kurosawa represented a ""western"" style of cinema, as opposed to Ozu, for instance. Ran is basically King Lear set in medieval Japan, whereas Kagemusha is more original in many ways, and less anachronistic. The themes of the Kagemusha's futile fight aganst destiny and his doppelganger-like identification with Shingen are also magnificently played. Finally, the very Japanese emphasis on passive control (Shingen's strategy is always to act as an umovable mountain on which to shatter his enemies) resonates in interesting ways.",1070582400,7,623,5.568421052631579

344443,4,6301661737,"""Kagemusha"" is Kurosawa's 1980 samurai war epic starring Tatsuya Nakadai is set during the late 1500s in Japan, the time period in which the country was torn apart by war.  The film begins with a long shot of 3 men seated in a room.  One is Shingen Takeda, warlord of the Takeda clan, the other is his brother, Nobukado, and the third is a strange man who looks almost identical to Shingen.  Nobukado tells his brother: ""I have imperonated you for a long time, but this is incredible.""  This is the primary focus of the film.  The story revolves around the Takeda clan, and the leader, Shingen.  But one day when he dies, he has to be replaced, and the double found at the beginning of the film is used.  We learn step by step his painful stages in suppressing himself to become another.  In the process, Kurosawa intercuts with the other 2 warlords trying to kill Shingen, Oda (Daisuke Ryu) and Ieyasu (Masayuki Yui; both actors would act in ""Ran"").  In creating a war epic, an epic that sometimes feels like a history lesson, Kurosawa has also created a study of identity while intertwining religious and philosophical Buddhist overtones.
  I have seen this film many times and I have had different interpretations every time I saw it.  I think that this might be the most solid of them all. For starters, some knowledge of the time period is necessary if one wants a truly compelling and fulfilling experience.  Without that, there are lose ends and confusion between characters.
  This is a good film; in fact, a very good film, but certainly not at the level of his next film, ""Ran.""  It's not really fair to judge this film on the same level as that, but it is almost inevitable as I have seen ""Ran"" many times.  There are strong visual similarities on both.  I do not think this is at the very top of the master's list of films.  I would put it on the 10 best films bu Kurosawa, but not top 5.  It is not edited to maximum impact.  There are scenes that go on for too long showing soldiers march up and down hills.  At times there are far too many silent moments between characters, and certain characters suffer from depth and development.  Katsuyori, Shingen's son, is rather flat and one dimensional.  The Kagemusha's changing into the lord is compelling to watch, as Nobukado notices the phases the double goes through as he becomes another.  Kurosawa raises the interesting and profound question of identity and delves into the issue.  At times, I wish there was more time devoted to the character of the double  rather than time spent in the historical area.  The battle scenes are powerful, but Kurosawa would later outdo them in ""Ran.""
  Many have said that one of the problems in the film is the lead actor.  It is true that the great Mifune is sorely missed, but Nakadai does a fine job carrying both roles in the film.  They say he is too subdued and quiet in his role. But then again, that is the character.  The side performances are good as well, but some did't have much to go with, as the script in ceratin areas was not strong.
  The visuals are among the highlights of the film.  Kurosawa stages a lot of his scenes as paintings (the beautifuly frightening dream the double has comes to mind).  Technically the film is well done.  Kurosawa has changed his camera techniques from his earlier films and rarely does close-ups and or quick cuts between scenes.  His camera is mostly steady and focuses on many long and atmospheric shots, creating a sense of calm and serene beauty even during battles.  The music is fine, but at times is too distracting and melodramatic.  Once again, Kurosawa would fix this in ""Ran"" when Takemitsu would do the score.
  It's pretty unfair how I keep bringing up ""Ran"" but as I said before, it is inevitable.  I would originally give this film 3 stars until the last half hour which contains some of the most powerful footage I have ever scene.***SPOILER ALERT***  From the moment in which everyone finds out that the double is who he is, the film becomes so sad, so powerful.  The scene in which the double is forced out in the rain is truly heartbreaking to watch.  And the final battle scene is simply breathtaking, horrific, and yet beautiful at the same time. Quick cuts are used as the rifles fire at the Takeda clan, and we can tell, through different perspectives that the Takeda clan is no more. Kurosawa manages to paint a world of hell yet do it artistically without glamorizing war.  The images of the dead horses and soldiers dipped in blood echoes Kurosawa's own past when his brother showed him a city in Japan after an earthquake hit.  His brother would not let him look away, and Kurosawa manages to convey that personal and intimate feeling to us.  And the final image of the dead kagemusha floating past the banner in the lake is just hypnotic.  Kurosawa ends the film just at the right moment.
  ""Kagemusha"" has fine performances, an involving story, decent music (at times a little too western-sounding), great photography, interesting characters (Though the script does fall short in certain areas), profound meanings (as all Kurosawa films do), and one hell of a finale.  The last half hour boosts this from a good to a great film.",1059350400,7,5209,4.604347826086957

344473,5,6301661737,"When Kurosawa made this film he was 70 years old and it stands without question as one of his best films.  What makes it so powerful is the portrayal of the perfect fusion of the warrior's emotional intensity with intellectual acuity.  Both emotion and intellect are focused solely, in this film, on enemy warlords outwitting each other and that focus is so strong that it more than carries the film through its 2 1/2 hour length.
In fact, so strong is the focus that the hapless title character (the shadow warrior)--a common thief who is a perfect lookalike for a mighty warlord, who recruits the thief and is then used by the warlord's retainers as a stand-in after the warlord's death--himself ultimately takes on the psychology of a warrior.  And this is true even after he is dismissed from service, after the ordained three years of his deception as the warlord have passed.
Nowhere else in film has the psychology of the warrior been portrayed so sharply, with so much focus, with so much depth--not even in other Kurosawa films, although Seven Samurai is the sine qua non of samurai films.  Yet here, in Kagemusha, we see the workings of the minds on both sides, whereas Seven Samurai's power comes from its depiction of how samurais use their intelligence to fight and outwit a completely insubstantial enemy--that is, the bandits, who are never shown up close or presented as anything other than marauding forces.
Kagemusha will never be equalled in its portrayal of the intensity of the warrior spirit.  Add to that the astounding vision of a filmmaker who knows more than any other how, where, and why a battle scene's power is derived.  As well, there is perfect production design, costuming, and set pieces.  There is the obvious attention to detail in capturing the entire world of feudal Japan.  All of these together make for a film so riveting, so well done, it is impossible to say anything bad about the film.  It just can't be done.
This is a must see for all serious students of film, and for all those who love a great adventure, and for all those who just flat out love movies.

But this Masterpiece made me have a closer look upon Akira Kurosawa, and I found a whole line of exceptional Films. After experiencing Kagemusha, I wanted to see all the other great films made by Kurosawa, one of the best movie makers ever. Today, I watch the movie once a year and still find things i haven't noticed before, things that only a genius like Kurosawa could have placed into a movie.
The Titel ""Kagemusha"" means Shadow of the Warrior.
The story takes place in the later 16th century. The Clan Daymios are fighting each other to gain control over the Country. Among them, the legendary Takeda Shingen. One day, he is shot by an enemy sniper and about to die. To prevent the fall of his house, he commands his most loyal man to keep his dead a secret for three years. To make the plan work, a perfect looking Double, a commoner, a thief, is taking over the representative role in public.
From this day on, the thief lives as a shadow, a shadow without a body to follow. More and more, he learn about loyality and respect. He finds joy again in existence and becomes more and more the body, he should be the shadow of. But a shadow is nothing without a body...
All in all, this is not only a great story, a great visual joy, but also a momentum of japanese society and military, and a melancholic view of mans nature.
If you can stand three hours of good movie, this one is for you. I only wish it would be available on DVD...
When does a compilation-box of Kurosawa movies appear on dvd? I just can't wait!",1015891200,10,1772,4.422018348623853
344476,4,6301661737,"Produced in 1980 with the finacial suport of George Lucas and Francis Ford Copolla, Akira Kurosawa's Kagemusha is in all aspects an epic. It was a prelude to Kurosawa's 1985 masterpiece Ran with his political and military struggles and existencial conflicts. The historical background is the feudal Japan during the ""Sengoku Jidai"" or ""Age of war"" that lasted to the begining of the XVII century. An insignificant thief is spared from death by Shingen, the warlord of the powerful Takeda clan. Because of the amazing resemblence with him, Shingen turns the thief into his ""kagemusha"" or ""shadow warrior"" training him to take his place in case of death for no less than three years. When Shingen is finally killed, the thief, under the vigilance of Nobukado, Shingen's brother and the higher retainers of the clan is forced to fool not only the enemies of the Takeda but also the whole rest of the clan. As the story progresses we see the double grow and mature, gaining corage to accomplish his role as best he can. There's also the relation between the double and Nobukado not just puppet and puppeteer but something more deep. The mask finally breaks and the death of Shingen is discovered by his enemies that soon take arms against the Takeda. From there on the fate of the clan will be decided in bloody final battle. The soundtrack spetacularly give the movie an epic,and heroic feel this being seen on the final scene. Kurosawa showed in this film, despite the slow ritm and the lack of great battles, all his talent as a master of his art.",993600000,,1546,4.729629629629629
344477,5,6301661737,"William Goldman, and American screenwriter, admonished aspiring screenwriters to begin scenes as close to end as possible. This is the sort of pacing that audiences--American audiences, at least--are accustomed to.  Akira Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha"" is quite a different sort of movie than would ever be produced by the American or even the European mainstream movie industry..  Its scenes are long and talky, with periods of silence, and still cameras.  The scenery, make-up, and mannerisms of the actors are exaggerated and often melodramatic, like you would find in formal Japanese cinema.  Anyone seeing this movie expecting a medieval action flick along the lines of, say, ""Exalibur,"" is very likely to be disappointed.
Which would be a shame.  This is a magnificent movie.  The photography and set design alone are breathtaking.  This is more a historical piece than a character study--the characters remain, for the most part, two-dimensional.  The focus remains tightly on the strategies and deceptions involved in keeping together the Shingen Takeda clan when their leader has died.
Scenes are often long and patiently filmed.  In one quietly dramatic scene, we see two lines of cavalry come galloping over an incline from a great distance.  The thunder of the racing horses builds, and the lines converge before us.  In this single shot, not much else happens, but the composition and sound create a powerful effect.  This movie is filled with subtle, magnificent moments like this.
The battle scenes--well, no one can beat Kurosawa here.  The final scene depicts devestation and defeat with surprisingly little gore, yet is no less powerful (and, arguably, more) than, say, the graphically violent scenes in ""Saving Private Ryan.""
This is a must-see for any movie buff.",987206400,82,1775,5.296428571428572

344479,5,6301661737,"I am just discovering the works of Kurisawa and this is one of the most(if not the most) interesting Kurisawa pictures.
The performance by Nadaki is simply amazing, it was great how he changed for each role as the time  went on.
The battle scenes are great. My favorite moment is when  Nadaki(the shadow) is sitting still and the men are all dying around him.  This image is as powerful as some of the later in his powerhouse RAN. The  ending is depressing beyond belief but totally believable.
This film is  challenging to undertand at first but I felt better on a second viewing  months later. A definite must own if you are a Kurisawa fan or want a ride  for the imagination.",958003200,,678,4.463414634146342
344480,5,6301661737,"I'm not good at remembering names, but I remember this movie very well.  The lord is injured and as luck would have it, his men have captured a lookalike for a petty theft previously - for just such an emergency.  When  the lord dies, the thief is made to impersonate the lord.
  Some people  like the drama and the battle scenes, which are top-notch.  What I found to  be exceptional was the portrayal of the imposter, who starts out as crass  and angry in the beginning.  Upon reluctantly taking position as a double,  the imposter rebels; he wants out and doesn't care much for his  ""sentence"" of three years (the agreed-upon time the imposter is  to be in place.)  But he does find his loyalty to the lord and land from  guilt and duty after a while, and although he is never at ease with his  position, he assumes it with responsibility.  His last act at the end  only makes the charge of the troops even more tragic, but it feels very  ""real"".",954806400,,949,4.381502890173411

The five stars thus reflects the film itself, about which other reviewers have written well and at length. However, be warned that the copy available through Amazon Video is NOT the revamped Criterion edition. It is 160 minutes long (the original US theatrical release length), and not the restored 180 minute version. Further, though the Amazon Video version is in HD, the picture quality will disappoint anyone expecting a high quality HD transfer. This looks like standard definition.
