The best offer is ""Uncivil Warriors"", an early short, very well directed (Del Lord), written (Felix Adler), and performed. The Civil War setting provides for some lively sight gags, particurlarly in the early camp scenes. When The Stooges are sent on a mission to recover Confederate war plans at Bud Jamison's (Colonel Butts') mansion you know it's going to be a wild scene. Typical of the time, however, the picture includes some insensitive racial content - with Curly in drag as Mrs. Dodge, Jamison insists on seeing ""her"" baby. Moe panics and returns with the first child he can find, not realizing he found a Black infant. The scene plays well, but still could have been edited.
""Three Missing Links"", from 1938, is the next best entry - Curly is ""discovered"" - he's chosen to play opposite Jane Hamilton (Mirabel Mirabel) in a movie adventure to be filmed in Africa. The only catch is that Curly is to play his part in a Gorilla suit!
""Microphonies"", from 1945, is certainly one of the best put together shorts by the Stooges. Directed and written by Edward Bernds, the story is a notch above, and gives the talented Christine McIntyre (Alice Bixby) a chance to show off her singing voice, and the under-appreciated Symona Boniface (Mrs. Bixby) another opportunity to display her comedic talents. The Stooges' clowning their way into a high society get together featuring an out of control lip-snyc of an actual radio station recording by Alice, is a fun departure. Their antics serve to boost Alice's career - ordinarily they would simply make a mess of the place and everybody in it.
The sad part of the whole affair is Curly Howard's tired performance. It's been said that he suffered a minor stroke prior to the previous ""If A Body Meets A Body"" and in this follow-up we see a real diminishment of a star. The childlike vitality is almost gone. From now on there would only be flashes of the ""old Curly"".",1033603200,2,2076,4.769444444444445
8164174,4,6302814065,"MICRO-PHONIES is a musical, but one of the Stooges' best. This should've been nominated for an Academy Award, like MEN IN BLACK. Too many scenes to discribe. A fondly remembered short.
UNCIVIL WARRIORS is a pretty good short. The best part is when the Stooges mistakingly set a pot holder into a cake. The Stooges coughing up feathers is a highlight.
THREE MISSING LINKS is the first Stooge short directed by Jules White, and he's already off to a good start. This is hilarious. The scenes where Curly is dressed as a gorilla is the funniest part.
An excellent tape, worth the price of MICRO-PHONIES and THREE MISSING LINKS alone.",1010966400,,630,4.736363636363636
