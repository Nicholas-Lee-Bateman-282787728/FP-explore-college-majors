6126756,5,B00H28A5EO,"Although there are some small imperfections in this performance, this is live opera and Don Carlo is a very, very difficult opera because it has so many demanding roles. Posa, the King, Eboli and Elizabeth are all excellent and Don Carlo is beyond excellent. All the principals gave truly memorable performances. It was beautiful, moving, heartfelt, dramatic and highly musical. Antonio Pappano conducted with drama, great musicality, great dynamic range and great emotional range, with an eye to detail although never losing the big line. The chorus and small parts were also excellent. I have performed this opera, own other DVDs, and have seen it numerous times live, including with the best of their day in 1970's Vienna (Ghiaurov, Corelli, Freni, Bumbry etc). This is by far the best!!! The Vienna Philharmonic is at it's very best and the orchestra playing is at a level unmatched by any other group for an opera. The only thing that I didn't like was the first scene. It is neither musically nor dramatically necessary (or even interesting) and only adds length to an already very long opera. If you like Verdi grand opera, this is a must own.",1402531200,2,1150,4.902564102564103
6126757,5,B00H28A5EO,"""Don Carlo"" is one of my favorite operas and, just for the heck of it, I reviewed my collection of ""Don Carlo(s)"": 10 on CD and 7 on DVD. So, if I say that, with the possible exception of a Bergonzi, Tebaldi, Bumbry, Fischer-Dieskau and Ghiaurov CD under Solti, if I would have to give most of them away and keep only one other, this DVD would be it.
What is there not to like? Jonas Kaufmann is a prince indeed, and the only tenor at present who knows exactly what to do with his gorgeous voice.  And his looks. stage presence and acting don't hurt either.
His partnering with Anja Harteros is and has been outstanding in other operas as well. The rest of the cast is also excellent with the possible exception of Thomas Hampson. Although his trills are still respectable, his voice in general has seen better days
I'm also happy with the unfussy, straight forward production and especially so when the Fontainebleau scene is included. But, beyond that, this is the only production I can remember - with the exception of the French version with Alagna and Hampson - (and this includes every performance I have ever seen on stage) - that shows the exchange of costumes between the Queen and Eboli so that the scene of the rendez-vous between Don Carlo and Eboli and his confusion make sense. (Just as I can never understand how one can understand the last act of ""Lucia di
Lammermoor"" if the Wolfscrag scene is omitted.)
Finally, the orchestra under Pappano holds together what makes this particular DVD  worthy of being among the most outstanding renditions of one of Verdi's masterpieces.",1402444800,46,1590,4.654804270462633
6126758,5,B00H28A5EO,"I continue fo find the quality of a performance by Jonas Kaufamnn exceptional.  His distinctive voice as well as his acting ability bring the characters to life. He connects the story with the music enabling what the composer and authof of the story had in mind and perhaps hoped for.  This performance, although not from the Met is no less exceptional.  However all cast members gave a  very good permance and I recomment it.

6126759,5,B00H28A5EO,"Of the several DVDs of the five-act Italian DON CARLO, this 2013 Salzburg Festival contribution to the Verdi bicentennial is easily the longest at 237 minutes. The following textual variants and rarities appear: (1) As in the 1980 and 1983 Met performances of the Dexter production, also featuring a generous edition, the opera begins with the introduction and chorus, the scene among the war-deprived French people, and Elisabetta's act of charity. (2) Rodrigo's description of the conditions of Flanders is spliced into his first scene with Carlo. (3) Act III begins with the costume exchange for Elisabetta and Eboli. The ballet is not performed; Eboli's reverie leads seamlessly into Carlo's ""Mezzanotte!"" We thus lose Verdi's lovely prelude for this act, most often heard in Italian five-act performances. (4) In Act IV Scene 2, there is the episode for tenor, bass, and chorus in which Carlo and Filippo mourn Rodrigo to a melody Verdi reused as the Lacrimosa of the Requiem. (5) When the people storm the prison and demand the Infante, Filippo challenges them at greater length. Eboli does not appear and tell Carlo to flee in this version of the scene; indeed, Carlo remains hunched over the dead body until the curtain closes. (6) When Carlo V pulls his grandson behind the grate, the opera ends with its hushed orchestral/choral variant following Elisabetta's scream. The familiar fortissimo orchestral reprise of the monks' melody is not heard.

This is conductor Antonio Pappano's third DON CARLO/S DVD, the first from the Chtelet in 1996, the second from the Royal Opera House in 2008. The first was sung in French, the later two in Italian, and each of the three differs from the others in performing edition. At Salzburg in 2013, he has attained mastery of the score -- its colors, its shapes,  its gait -- and the response of the Vienna Philharmonic is breathtaking. This is truly festival-level playing, and pungent detail is everywhere, from the brilliance of the principal cellist's reading of the solo atop Act IV, to the terrifying rumbles and whispers of the accompaniment to the Inquisitor's scene, to the sting following Eboli's confession of her greatest sin. The outburst following Posa's intemperate ""Orrenda, orrenda pace! La pace  dei sepolcri!"" sounds like more than the score being rent asunder; it sounds like a seismic cataclysm. Without intended slight to the distinguished cast, it is Pappano and his players, and the equally superb chorus under the direction of Jrn Hinnerk Andresen, who are the true stars of the event.

Both Jonas Kaufmann and Anja Harteros take some time to get into very best form vocally, and I suspect they were husbanding their resources in consideration of their unusually lengthy assignments. Kaufmann has one of the world's great operatic voices at this time, and as usual there is much hypnotic soft singing. He approaches high notes cautiously in the Fontainebleau act; by Act III Scene 2, challenging Filippo, he is singing with abandon and panache. His acting is alert to Carlo's instability and psychological fragility, and there are some bold choices in the garden scene (he appears on the verge of cracking up when weighing the possibility of giving his papers to the King's favorite). Harteros has neither the glamour and the aptitude for detailed acting of Marina Poplavskaya (ROH) nor the stylistic and linguistic Italianate sureness of Renata Scotto and Mirella Freni (the two Met DVDs), but she has more of an Elisabetta voice than any of the three, and although she flies sharp occasionally, it is a pleasure to hear her envelop these phrases with her grand musical manner, her beauty of tone. She can also be quite affecting in her stillness, her regal poise, her gentleness, her tranquil yet deeply sad gazes. She is moving for doing less.

Ekaterina Semenchuk's Eboli is promising, and delivers on much if not at all of the promise. There is enough, in other words, to suggest a great Eboli in the making, but still in early days. Once past a Veil Song that is very careful and not ideally flexible, one begins to warm to her. She has an alluring presence and a voice of fine quality and impressive scale throughout the range; both the garden scene and that in the King's study feature formidable singing. However, she was more of an authentic spitfire singing in her native language as Marina in the Met's BORIS GODUNOV. Here, as an actor, she has not entirely shaken off a certain studied blandness. There is nothing bland in Thomas Hampson's Rodrigo. He never was or will be a classic Verdi baritone in the manner of Merrill, MacNeil, Bastianini, or Cappuccilli, and the years have taken some of the nap off a once-beautiful sound -- he resorts to raw shouting a good deal in order to achieve the volume. Still, his long experience has led him to viable ways of putting the character across, and one cannot but notice the intelligence and the intensity with which he applies himself to a complex figure. There is a fierceness that keeps the character in focus, and it contrasts well with Kaufmann's equivocations and preoccupations in the title role.

The veteran Matti Salminen, here Filippo, has also given many years of service, and one hears this in a strained top and a loss of dynamic finesse and color. He is a hulking figure on the stage, and in public scenes a bit of a bully. Ghiaurov, Furlanetto, and Van Dam (all on video) got more dimension and poignancy into the character, and all seemed to me to confront the music with more suitable voices. Salminen is not terribly dynamic physically either, or is not directed to be, sitting at his desk and barely reacting when his young wife runs in demanding justice, and smirking when confronting her with the jewel casket. Salminen is not a total writeoff, being convincingly ""senior"" as well as convincingly intimidating, but one may have the feeling that King Marke or Hagen has wandered into the wrong opera. Eric Halfvarson was the Grand Inquisitor on both of Pappano's previous DVDs, and returns here, as does Robert Lloyd as Carlo V (from the ROH DVD) -- both are assured and professional and do not surprise. From among smaller roles, Benjamin Bernheim may be the best Count Lerma/Herald I have ever heard; I found myself sitting up and taking notice.

Peter Stein's production follows the modern trajectory one can trace elsewhere in the work of Luc Bondy (Chtelet) and Nicholas Hytner (ROH, later seen at the Met). Ferdinand Wgerbauer's set designs are spare and utilitarian, probably created in part with an eye toward ease and speed of scene changes in this long work. The lavish shows of Visconti, Dexter, and Zeffirelli (all of which are on DVD, the Dexter twice) seem of another era. Even with that allowance made, the production does not strongly suggest a time and place, and the only scene that is really striking to the eye is the beginning of II/2, for Eboli, Tebaldo, and the women, subsequently joined by the Queen and Rodrigo, which takes place beside a decorative pool, the dominant color a soothing sea-foam green. Stein makes some choices I question (why are three ladies-in-waiting visible chatting in the background of the fraught confrontation between Elisabetta and Carlo, when Elisabetta having been left unattended is a major plot point?). It would have been fair to expect more distinction in the handling of the personalities from the director, considering his experience and reputation and the eight weeks of rehearsal he had with the cast, but this is efficient work that does not get in anyone's way and lets the opera make its points. Joachim Barth's lighting is expressive, and the video direction of Agnes Mth gives us many welcome wide shots of one of the largest indoor stages in the world.

The second of the two Met DVDs, the 1983, provides an opulent traditional production, superbly played under James Levine, with several great 20th-century singers in roles with which they are closely associated. The ROH 2008 cannot be easily overlooked for the moving performances of Furlanetto and Poplavskaya as the royal couple. But the new Salzburg provides more music than either, and while it does not score in every specific, it is as good a DON CARLO/S DVD as we have had or are likely to have.",1401667200,68,8273,4.916964924838941
6126760,5,B00H28A5EO,"This Don Carlo recorded at Salzburg Festival in 2013 surpasses every opera recording I own in terms of audio fidelity lending amazing presence to overwhelm this listener at first hearing the orchestra and chorus at the opera's opening.  Jonas Kaufmann soon appears to signal the incredible richness of this dream  performance.  The Don Carlo - Elizabetta duet with fabulous soprano Anja Harteros that soon follows is sublime.  As a life-long opera lover I must say that Kaufmann is indisputably the greatest tenor of them all - his range is amazing with a most appealing and dramatic  baritone quality that adds substance to his performance and makes his seemingly effortless high notes all the more spectacular.  In addition his natural acting ability is rare to find, and he also looks better than any tenor in memory.

6126765,5,B00H28A5EO,"I decided to buy this DVD because of the good reviews on the other hand I was familiar with two of the main characters: Carlo and Posa played by Jonas Kaufmann and Thomas Hamptson whom I knew from other performances.
While watching this DVD I found some scenes I was unfamiliar with, as the version I had only had 4 acts and this one had 5. It seems some versions have passages that were cut or added. The production I had with Jose Carreras and directed by Karajan has only 4 acts.
This production is a 5 acts version which I enjoyed a great deal. The scenes that are added are very beautiful, for instance at the beginning of the first act after a chorus by woodcutters there is an encounter between Carlo and Elizabetta  who have fallen in love and are thinking  about  the future marriage which is very moving. Other passage in this version makes the story clearer.
 The singing, orchestra and characters are excellent.
The scenery and costumes were very successful, such as the scene where a group of prisoners were put to death during the inquisition was very convincing.

 I highly recommend this DVD for any one who wants to enjoy a very good production of a longer version of this powerful and beautiful opera.",1423353600,4,1219,4.54337899543379
6126766,4,B00H28A5EO,"I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 120"" screen and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6"" apart and the surround speakers are on my sides. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.

This DTS-HD MA 5.0 surround recording is for those who don't like the effect of body microphones and as such, it is quite good. You can see a wire of a body mic. on the singers back neck sometimes but they have been used only sparingly. The recording gives you the impression of sitting in a front row, having the orchestra spread out in front of you from surround speaker to surround speaker, for me about 160 degrees. As the orchestra pit is quite deep, the chorus when spread out on stage behind the orchestra would have a narrower sound stage and that is how it is presented here. You hear the chorus about  halfway to the surround speakers, about 90 degrees for me. The principal voices then are mainly through the center, although there is a bit of movement to the voices when the principals go to the sides.

While most of the singing is towards the front, the singers are often a few feet away from the stage microphones and thus you get the audio impression of them singing behind the orchestra. It is quite realistic and with the applause mostly from the surrounds, it gives you the impression of actually being there in a front row. The microphones also catch the reflections from the rather large venue, enhancing that experience.

Unfortunately, this realism also shows the drawbacks of this type of recording: The orchestra will drown out the voices at louder parts. The balance favors the orchestra, then chorus and then the principals. The voice of Matti Salminen suffers most, as he is often in the back of the stage and furthest away from a microphone. Hampson, Kaufmann and Harteros suffer little, as they are placed mostly in the front.

I needed a loudness setting of -6 db, which is higher relative to most other recordings that I play at around -10 db, but it needed that to come alive.

I give it 4 stars for the surround audio.

I don't have any other performance of this opera, so I can't compare it. But it is hard to imagine that anybody can outperform Kaufmann and Hampson in singing and acting and the Wiener Philharmoniker under Pappano in playing this opera.",1417132800,4,2530,4.584070796460177

6126768,5,B00H28A5EO,"The Best so Far......
This complete (more or less) Don Carlo is the best so far (and the longest at almost four hours without ballet). And it's not likely to be bettered soon. It is not the ""Grand Opera"" as Verdi wrote it for the Paris Opera (in French) complete with ballet and ""Grand"" in the Meyerbeer Paris fashion. Yes it would have been even better  if this recording had been done in French but most non-French native singers can't handle that language precisely, whereas Italian is singable by all.
The complete Fountainbleau scene is essential for understanding the rest of the opera. The peasants duress shows why peace was needed and why Elizabetta had to say ""yes"" to marriage to old Filippo II after having just fallen in love with her previously engaged suitor Filippo II's son Don Carlo. Themes from the Fountainbleau persist in the rest of the opera and remind us of the brief moments of happiness shared by Carlo and Elizabetta who are now ""mother and son"".
I love this opera. It is my favorite of all the operas I have seen or heard. I have about a dozen CD  versions and even more DVDs and two blu-rays. My first live Don Carlo was 1960 with Tucker, Gobbi and Christoff. It was awesome; I fell in love with it immediately. Later I made a trip to the Escorial outside Madrid to visit the tomb of Don Carlo; it is small and in a dusty corner. The Don Carlo of history was nothing like the impassioned hero of Schiller's poem/play. The real Don Carlo was deformed and mentally deficient; probably the result of generations of inbreeding among the Hapsburgs. He murdered several people and was incarcerated by his father Filippo II. He died there at age 23. He had been engaged to Elizabetta of Valois whom he never saw.  But for me he will always be the impetuous hero of Verdi's greatest masterpiece. To me now the image of the hero is Jonas Kaufmann's portrayal of Don Carlo in the present recording. He is impetuous, he is impassioned, he is everything Don Carlo should be. And he is handsome and the great dramatic tenor of the day. It is a grand portrayal.
He is pretty well matched by Thomas Hampson's Rodrigo. He is suave, debonair  and the perfect foil for Don Carlo. I was at first put off by the opening lines of Elizabetta in the Fountainbleau  scene. I thought  Anja Harteros too old to be the young princess of Valois. Later she became a majestic Queen of Spain and her voice had warmed up. She then showed herself to be regal and capable of high drama and rich tone; perfect for the role. Ekaterina Semenchuk was a remarkable good as the full voiced Princess Eboli (even without the eye-patch). A luscious voice and beautiful physical features.
The one disappointment in this recording is the Filippo II of Matti Salminen. He seemed to be walking through his part until the scene with the Grand Inquisitor. Then sparks did fly between Salminen and the Inquisitor, Eric Halfvarson. A great moment! It also let you know that this is a political opera and not just a romance. It's about power and the loss of power.  Under Emperor Charles V (Carlo's grandfather) Spain and the Hapsburgs were at the zenith of their power as was the Roman Catholic Church, But now much of Filippo II empire was festering in revolt  and the church couldn't execute the religious rebels fast enough (Auto de fe - every day!).
In the present day, operas aren't ""Grand"" anymore. I loved the lavish productions of Visconti, Dexter and Zeffirelli of yersteryears. But now we have the bland nothingness of Wogerbauer sets for Don Carlo. A few twigs for a forest; a forsaken Fountainbleau, yuk. However the costumes of Annamaria Heinreich were appropriate to the time and beautiful.
Last but not least- a full bow to Pappano and the Weiner Philharmoniker and Operchor. Absolutely wonderful playing and singing!
All in all I'm quite happy with this production. It's the best so far.",1409788800,9,3881,4.647230320699708

There is, as I understand it, only the ballet missing from the complete score written by Verdi for the Paris premiere, but the cast, at least some of them, were unwilling to relearn the text in French and so the opera is performed in the Italian translation.  In this way this performance misses becoming a perfect document.  Musically the performance is first rate.  Kaufmann is magnificent in the title role, Harteros is excellent as the Queen, Hampson is really first-class as Rodrigo.  Semennchuk is very good in the role of Eboli and only Salminen is a little underpowered as the King.  Age?  Hard to tell why.  His monolog in Act 4 is very impressive, however, as is the ensuing scene with the Grand Inquisitor (well done by Halfvarson).

6126772,5,B00H28A5EO,"In the 20th century, there are relatively few 'Don Carlos' recordings that includes the opening Fontainbleau Scene (Act 1).  I must confess that any such 'Don Carlo' is incomplete to me.  Such productions robbed the audience of the golden opportunities to savour the joy of the young pair of Carlos and Elisabetta falling in love for each other at first sight.  This is a romantically elaborate encounter containing a sudden and unexpected change of circumstances moving beyond the control of the couple.  If sympathy to the lovers' plight is called for in the later Acts, such must find its root in the Fontainbleau encounter.
This Salzburg production is a full account of Verdi's Don Carlo, in 5 long Acts.  The cast leaves aboslutely no room for betterment and is the absolute 'choice of the moment', even though purists may argue that there is absolutely no Italian in the singing cast.
In the title role, leading German tenor Jonas Kaufmann cuts a figure that is passionate and callous to danger. A prince struggling against fate, and oblivious to political consequences.  In his league, the Marquis di Posa of Thomas Hampson is a much cooler headed 'dandy', yet faithful and calculated towards political struggles.  Wearing the crowns, we have two of present opera's long standing bassos - Robert Lloyd as Carlos V and Matti Salminen as Filippo II.  Both showed their vast experience in their respective portrayals.  As the scheming Princess Eboli, young Russian mezzo-soprano Semenchuk sings in luscious and creamy tone, sounding at once youthful and powerful.  In the role of the unhappy queen Elisabetta d'Valois, Anja Harteros is fully regal and firm in the latter Acts, while fully maintaining her deep felt passion for the Carlos of Kaufmann.  In this Five-Act production, the carrying through of the drama of fateful separation is only partially successful.
The reason for this partial success may be two-fold.  All the three main characters of Carlo, Elisabetta and Rodrigo warm up a bit slower than is required.  They are not aided by the sets and scenery.  The bleakness of the later Acts does not find its suitable contrast in the opening Fontainbleau Scene, in which we but see a big hole in the centre of the stage with Kaufmann and Harteros warming up by the side of an almost visibly electronic-ignited spark of fire.
Elsewhere, as the work unfolds, all the main characters sing like gods/goddesses.  Hampson's rather stuttered Rodrigo gained its full vocal splendour in the Garden Scene and permeates right to the Jail Scene of Rodrigo's death.  Salminen and Halfvarson's dialogue between monarch and clergy makes the audience's hair standing on end. The final farewell between Carlo and Elisabetta heart-breakingly touching.
This may not be the most visually satisfying 'Don Carlo' on DVD, but the musical level is homogeneously high both on stage and in the pit. The cast is excellent without a single weakness.  The stage direction is otherwise impeccably effective but for the minimalist sets that work only partially.",1405987200,4,3044,5.080321285140562

6126775,1,B00H28A5EO,"I bought this DVD, based on the positive revues, without taking a close look at the cast. I should know better.

 Im not sure about where to start, with this rendition of this opera. Im a strong Verdi fan and, when his operas are performed properly, they are marvelous. This rendition, is , unfortunately, not even close to that category.

 Elisabetta is written, by Verdi, as the teenaged daughter of the king of France. To have her portrayed by a 42 year old Anja Harteros, who looks and sounds sixty, is almost a sin. Her makeup made her look even older, especially with that weird, white-face pancake, which came and went. Also, her voice is far from its peak.

 Having Don Carlo/Infante, who is supposed to be a 22 year old prince of Spain, portrayed by a 45 year old Jonas Kaufmann, who, even with his gray hair and 4 day old gray stubble, looks 20 years younger than Harteros, makes even less sense. The only good thing I can say, about Kaufmann, is that his voice is still excellent.

 There is no positive chemistry, between Kaufmann and Harteros. In some scenes, it almost looks like they strongly dislike each other, off stage.

 Hampson, a baritone, who was 59, playing the part of Rodrigo, Don Carlos slightly older friend, looks much younger then Harteros or Kaufmann. His voice is still close to the top.

 The world of opera is awash in excellent, young talent, who would have been perfect in these roles. Why, then, are we made to suffer with over-the-hill, over-aged performers, trying to play the parts of teenagers and young twenties?

 The costuming, lighting and stage props are, also, strange. In her first appearance, we see Elisabetta in a costume which I would have expected to see on a 1940s~50s skid row floosey, not a princess.

 Most of the other costumes are monochromatic black or black/white combinations, with spots of color, here and there. The lighting also tended to be monochromatic, with no rhyme or reason. The yellow dunce caps and yellow gowns, placed on the condemned, in the burning-at-the-stake scene, is nonsensical.

6126776,5,B00H28A5EO,"Don Carlo (Verdi) is the opera that no one can imagine, as each performance seems unique; it is very difficult to find a staging of the complete work. There are almost as many Don Carlo as there are stagings of it. There are even changes between the version of the premire in Paris, in 1867, and those performed two days later. There are also the editions of 1872, signed in Naples, and those of 1884 (made for Vienna) and 1886 (Modena). This last one excludes the ballet. Nowadays, there is generally a distinction between the French version of 1867 and the Italian one of 1884, with libretto by Zanardini and De Lauzieres.

This major title of the Verdian production lives within a tapestry of contradictions: the plot gathers historical characters, but they are all at the service of an idea that is not interested in the real story; at the time of the premire the composer was accused of being influenced by Meyerbeer and Wagner, but the score is an example of the most profound and complex Verdi, and although it demands a great show, its soul is to be found in the more intimate scenes. To all of the aforesaid, we have to add that, despite the love conflict, it is a political opera that shows a hard-hearted king (Filippo II di Spagna) who is finally willing to speak of freedom and to open up his heart to a rebel (Rodrigo de Posa), and challenging the interference of the Catholic Church in State decisions.

There still remains love, here betrayed, as well as desire: Elisabetta di Valois marries Filippo although she is in love with his son, Carlo; Filippo loves and suffers on account of a woman who he knows is in love with his son; Carlo loves his madre (mother), as he calls Elisabetta, and makes the love conflict he has with his father compete with the differences he has with him in terms of government; the Princess of boli loves Carlo and that is why she ends up by denouncing Elisabetta. The best term to describe the relationship between Carlo and Rodrigo is bromance; their unbeatable friendship is demonstrated with Posas immolation. He and Carlo wish a freedom they have never lived; they seem to love each other in that desire for freedom.

There are various aspects that allow us to say that this is a Don Carlo of reference. Staged in Salzburg in 2013, it is the version in five acts of the Italian translation, without the ballet but with the scene in the third act in which Isabel and boli exchange dresses, which is not to be found in most of the record editions. Peter Stein theatre director who founded the Schaubhne am Lehniner Platz, a cutting-edge company of the German theatre opts for a staging with traditional elements based on a careful work of the actors, oozing with questions about the nature of the conflicting private relationships, but which also takes a stand on the variegated political and religious conflicts addressed by the libretto. It supports their work with a functional and naked staging, with delicate allusions to the Spain of the 16th century; lights that render suggestive twilight pictures, especially for the solitude of Carlo and for his duets with Isabel and Rodrigo; a luxurious wardrobe with Diego Velzquez as reference, and a sextet of singers who know that having a voice is not enough.

From the pit, Maestro Antonio Pappano conducts with passion and manages to capture the shadows inhabiting this difficult score, achieving sonorous climaxes in the crescendo of the love duet between Carlo and Isabel in the first act, in the ambiguous passion that consumes Rodrigo, and in the huge concertante of the Auto da Fe. The Infante of tenor Jonas Kaufmann is a dispossessed and melancholy prince, a vulnerable and sickly hero rendered light and shadows through a dark and burnished voice that disturbs with its tenderness and beauty, and dazzles with its masterly use of the messa di voce. Anja Harteros sings an Elisabetta di Valois who is pure nobility in the attitude and rigor in the phrasing, features that are also to be found in Thomas Hampson (Rodrigo de Posa), whose vocal enamel is not the same of recent years, but is a sensitive and musical artist like few others. Ekaterina Semenchuk natural successor of the Obraztsova and Borodina lineage imposes her boli through a voluptuous and intense singing, while two unparalleled veterans, basses Matti Salminen (a master of declaimed singing) and Eric Halfvarson (terrifying), render the confrontation between Filippo II and the Grand Inquisitor into a lesson in theatrical tension.

Some may find Kaufmann's (and the director?) interpretation puzzling. It is based on the historical Carlos, Prince of Asturis who was physically deformed, mentally unstable and probably epileptic due to inbreeding in the house of Hapsburg. The portrayal focuses on the mental instability. In interviews, Kaufmann discussed this approach convincingly, For viewers familiar with the heroic & rebellious Don Carlo, as written by Schiller/Verdi, this approach may be disconcerting. Watch and listen with an open mind.",1403395200,4,706,5.418181818181818
6126779,4,B00H28A5EO,"The Salzburg Festival is one of the priciest in Europe, competing with Bayreuth for top dollar. This should guarantee that casts, production and orchestra all are of top quality. Nothing should be routine and careless. To a certain extent this should be visible not only as regards the singers, but the production as well. With Pappano in the pit and the Vienna Philharmonic as the orchestra musical values are usually high.

But the choice to mount Don Carlo means that many editorial decisions have to be made. What language? What music to include and what to omit? The opera that Verdi set was a French text. He had  nothing to do with the Italian edition. This seems superficial but anyone with a knowledge of both languages knows that resetting any opera into a language not originally set is toying with a problem that is not easily quelled. Of course there is the problem of finding first rate singers who can sing the French edition with distinction. There is one DVD that sings what Verdi wrote, the Chatelet set which is now nearly twenty years old. For the most part it is a performance to treasure. Waltraute Meier was the weakest link. Surely this is not a role that has been active in her repertoire; but once over the Veil Song she is able to redeem herself. Alagna' s French credentials are well established; Van Dam's as well. Hampson is one of the few who cares enough to respect the requirements  of this tradition and his French is very good. Mattila, too, is sensitive enough to  deliver the text intelligently even though it is obvious that French was not her first language. Pappano had a tenure at the house in Brussels and is aware of the requirements of this opera. The orchestra may not be the Vienna Philharmonic but overall the performance comes across as a ""festival"" performance in a way that the new one doesnt.

The best reason for acquiring this DVD is Jonas Kaufmann. He brings his usual intellignce and musicianship to everything that he does. Clips on YouTube of the ROH revival in which he replaced Villazon are harbingers of the pleasures that he brings to this production. Harteros is blessed with a gorgeous voice, a lush spinto only lacking in Italiianta; she can hardly be blamed for that having Greek and German ancestry. One only need to go to Scotto's performance to see what is missing and while I love the lady I have to admit that her entrance into Italian spinto roles raises more than a few qualifications, ones that need not apply to Harteros. Her muscianship and artistry match the tenor's--a marriange devoutly to be wished. The Eboli. Ekaterina Semenchuk, probably the best on the DVD performances. Most are able to manage the Don fatale but come to grief in the Veil song which required the kind of singing that seemingly isn't taught either in convservatorys or privately. It's a difficult role and the mezzo know that her second aria is always going to garner more applause that the coloratura required in the earlier aira.

Hampson is competing with himself in this set and the younger Hampson trumps this later performance. The voice is now quire dry and the liquid legato singing that was offered in the Chatelet is here replaced by many deivices that mask the flaws of the current state of his singing. Hampson is frequently criticized as not being a Verdi singer. The same charge was leveled at Fischer-Dieskau and their repertoires did overlap. Alas there are no Verdi baritones such as the ones cited in Todd Kaye's review. Georgian and Serbian entries simply fill in the gap. At his best (the Chatelet) I never felt shortchanged; disappointment reigned in this current performance. Keenlyside who sang in the ROH performances is also a lyric baritone, albeit younger; his Macbeth from ROH is superb although it is his intelligence and artistry that carrry the day. The Intendent at Salzburg should have looked elsehwere.

I wonder how often Matti Salminen has sung Phillip--not often I would imagine. This artist who is nearing 70 has left a recorded legacy of distinction but he remains a strange choice for this role. Unfortunately I found him dull and the voice dry. And while he didn't embarass himself he didn't provide that authority, vocal and dramatic that is inherent in the role. Indeed, he seemed bored at timies.

I have never seen a Peter Stein production and after this I don't care if I ever see another one. Minimalism is not something I object to but I found this production even weaker than the ROH production which looked cheap and utterly unevocative of the era and the location. This is French Grand Opera but unlike the majority of the genre it is a great opera, possibly Verdi't greatest. Obviously we will never see productions that the Opera offered when Meyerbeer reigned, but surely something more opulent could have been provided. And it would appear that Stein hasn't the faintest idea of what to do which a chorus as they are frequently lined up as for a sing-a-long.

Every set has its strengths and weaknesses--could it be otherwise in an opera requirinig at least five great singers--and ones who can act as well. With the Philharmoniker and Pappano in the pit and those singers I have singled out there is much that can be enjoyed here--even if it is in the wrong language!",1403136000,13,5273,4.760393873085339
8629186,4,B00H28A5EO,"I bought this to replace my Covent Garden DVD with Villazon. The image is gorgeous, far superior to the DVD Don Carlo (for example), and this is emphasized by the gorgeous costumes. The sound is inferior because of the placement of the voices, they are not at all forward, effectively causing the opera to play at a very low volume. Except for Eboli the singing is mostly inferior to the Covent Garden version. There is more music in this production and that is nice.",1512518400,2,467,4.571428571428571

Jonas Kaufmann is the reason I added this ""Don Carlo"" and he is well worth the expense.  He is not alone in the excellence of his performance - all the singers deliver fine performances.  My other ""Don Carlo"" stars Jose Carreras, who is also wonderful.  It will always be a hard decision when I want to see this opera at home.",1504569600,,511,4.633333333333334

8629193,5,B00H28A5EO,"Verdi spent over 20 years writing and re-writing Don Carlo, which some regard as the greatest opera ever written.  If we can put up with 6 to 9 hours in Wagner operas, why not 41/2 of Verdi.  This being the absolute complete opera I heard parts I'd never heard before.  Most important is the Prison Scene which contains the magnificent melody Verdi took out and used instead in his Requiem Mass.  It's moving to see Carlo and Philip mourning over the body of this hero.  The cast is excellent and the reviewer who complained about Philip being too grey haired is mistaken.  He sings about his grey hair in his aria,  Ella giammai m'amo'.  The only tenor I would prefer as Carlo is Roberto Alagna, whom I heard at the Met, where the production is beautiful...Carlo commits suicide at the end and it's a great idea, since the opera is all about death anyway.  Kaufman is excellent and  so is the soprano, Anja Harteros.  Hampson is also excellent and the two basses.  Ekaterina Semenchuk is a knockout.  The production is not good.  It's great to have the duet between Elizabetta and Eboli and see for once the exchange of veils, which makes the mis -identification by Carlo  understandable.  Only Verdi would have the courage to have the burning of the heretics on stage and so powerful.  The last soprano aria and duet are some of greatest moments in opera.  Pappano is great conductor in this repertoire.  When the opening scene is left out the aria Io l'ha vidi is sung with a very dramatic introduction.  I would like to see the aria repeated.  After all in the prologue Carlo sings not having seen Elizabetta yet; while in the first act he sings that he has.  I guess I'm a Verdi fanatic.  I am trying to find out when Don Carlo will be performed at the Met again...the production I last saw originated at Covent Garden and I'm hoping there will be a new and appropriate production like Covent Garden's.  Any info would be appriciated.",1447632000,5,1939,4.569767441860465

8629195,3,B00H28A5EO,"I bought this DVD partly because of the many five-star reviews, and partly out of curiosity; besides the price was low.  I already own the Met's Don Carlo (Mirella Freni, Placido Domingo, Louis Quilico, and Grace Bumbry) and the French Don Carlos (Karita Mattila, Roberto Alagna, Thomas Hampson,  and Waltraud Meier).  I find both of these far more enjoyable than the one I am reviewing.  Mirella Freni is a more moving Elisabetta than Anja Harteros (especially in the last act), and so is Karita Mattila.  Jonas Kaufmann at times looks and sounds like an imitation of Placido Domingo; I prefer the original.  And I don't think any of the other  Princesses Eboli is a match for Grace Bumbry.

This, of course, is the personal opinion of a casual viewer, without extensive musical knowledge.  All the same, I would recommend that you start with the (old-fashioned) Met performance if you prefer Italian, and with the Chatelet performance if you prefer French.  The Salzburg version is not about to become a rarity any time soon, even with so many 5-star reviews.  I found it just plain ordinary, and very forgettable (and I guess the price will go further down).",1433116800,8,1161,4.842639593908629
