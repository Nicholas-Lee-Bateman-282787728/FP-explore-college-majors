1943976,5,B0000TPA4C,"Thus spoke the chimpanzee Cornelius (Roddy McDowall, 1928-1998) while reading from the sacred scrolls in the 1968 classic sci-fi film ""Planet of the Apes"".  It's difficult to believe that 35 years have passed since this landmark film was produced in which a group of astronauts land on a planet dominated by intelligent apes and the local humans are mute, uneducated, and living like animals.  The four astronauts had left Earth in the late twentieth century in a spaceship capable of light speed and were placed in suspended animation for the duration of their long journey to another star system.  They were George Taylor (Charleton Heston), Landon (Robert Gunner), Dogde (Jeff Burton) and a female astronaut named Stewart (Dianne Stanley).  The spaceship crash-landed on a planet in a lake and automatically awakened the crew.  Taylor, Landon and Dogde managed to escape the sinking ship, but Stewart's suspended animation chamber had not survived.  Just prior to disembarking, Taylor read the ship's chronometer, which showed the year to be 3978.  Their journey had lasted for 2000 years.  The trio paddled to shore, then walked through a lifeless terrain, but eventually came across vegetation and scarecrow-like figures.  Ignoring the warning, they proceeded into a lush oasis of water and food; but intelligent apes that protected it captured the trio along with several mute local humans.  Having suffered an injury, Taylor awakened in a cage, cannot speak and had been treated by a chimpanzee veterinarian named Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter, 1922-2002), who is Cornelius' fiance.  When Taylor is able to demonstrate his intelligence, the conservative orangutan Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans, 1901-1989) wants him dissected.
""Planet of the Apes"" was an adaptation of the 1963 French sci-fi novel ""La Plante des singes"" by Pierre Boulle (1912-1994), who also wrote ""La pont de la rivire Kwai"" (1952) which was the basis for the 1957 film ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"".  Writers Michael Wilson (1914-1978) and Rod Serling (1924-1975, of the original ""Twilight Zone"" TV series) transformed the novel into the film's story.  Franklin J. Schaffner (1920-1989) directed the film. Morton Haack (?-1987) received an Oscar nomination for Best Costume design, and Jerry Goldsmith was nominated for Best Original Music Score. (Jerry Smith has composed music for hundreds of films and TV shows including ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" (1970), ""Alien"" (1979), ""Poltergeist"" (1982), ""L.A. Confidential"" (1997), ""Mulan"" (1998), ""The Mummy"" (1999) and several ""Star Trek"" films & TV series.) John Chambers (1923-2001) recieved an honory Oscar for his makeup work in the film.  Memorable scenes include the stolen clothes, the capture, Taylor's first words to the apes, Taylor with Dr. Zaius, the cave and the closing scenes.
Overall, I rate the original 1968 ""Planet of the Apes"" film with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  Sadly, none of the four sequels that followed were as good as the original, but of those, ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (1970) was the best.  Tim Burton's 2001 remake of ""Planet of the Apes"" had many wonderful special effects, but its alternate story, mediocre acting and cameo of Charleton Heston as an ape was far less engaging than the 1968 original.  Hence, between the 1968 and 2001 versions, I highly recommend the 1968 version for being far more realistic and better acted.",1076112000,,3374,5.195571955719557
1943977,3,B0000TPA4C,"This release offers very little in the way of new material. If you already own the Evolution box set, this goes double for you. The commentary tracks, in you can call them that, are spotty and pieced together from old interviews. One of the few actual new bits turns out to be an old Mego toy ad that looks and sounds terrible! Menu graphics, as well as the box art itself, are really lame. This is a fine example of the license holder strip-mining its property!",1076025600,9,462,4.383720930232558
1943978,4,B0000TPA4C,"I have to say that I agree with most of the negative comments already made here over the new ""35th Anniversary"" DVD edition of ""Planet of the Apes"" (1968).  This appears to been something of a rush job on the part of 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment to please the die-hard fans of the film.  Unfortunately this package doesn't contain enough of the things those very fans covet most: an extensive photo gallery of behind-the-scenes shots, deleted footage from well-known cut scenes, and a gallery of nearly every product ever released with the ""Planet of the Apes"" logo stamped on it.  Also, most of the extra stuff here has been previously released on DVD, with only Roddy McDowall's private 16mm films taken during the production being the most fascinating extra on the two-disc set.  Jerry Goldsmith provides a wonderful commentary but there are long stretches between his comments, and there's no isolated score, which would have been nice.
So what is there to get excited about?  Well, finally this classic Science Fiction film is available in the anamorphic DVD format of 16X9.  If you have a widescreen video display with progressive scan this movie is going to look marvelous.  For a 1968 flick, the movie looks remarkably good, a tribute to the original Panavision photography.  And the movie sounds better than ever, with a stereo that now finally approaches the original 4-track sound of the era.  It's true that there's hardly any rear surround information, but this is typical of the era's mono surround track for four channel films.
If you're not a fan of the ""Planet of the Apes"" and hardly know anything of its production, then this DVD is going to tell you everything you'll want to know and more.  After viewing everything on this disc you may want to ""Escape from the Planet of the Apes.""  And if you are a member of the ""Apes"" cult of fans, then just keep writing to Fox for ""more, more, more.""  There are still the four ""Apes"" sequels waiting to get the anamorphic treatment on DVD.",1075939200,7,2006,4.765895953757226
1943979,5,B0000TPA4C,"I give 5 stars to the film, which, in my opinion, is one of the greatest films ever. The packaging for the 35th anniv. edition is awful.  First they put a photo of Caesar (from Conquest) on the cover, the back cover has a photo of Ursus (from Beneath) and the inside opens up to the gorilla stadium scene from Beneath. Are they clueless at Fox??? The film is Planet and should include photos from Planet (not its sequels!!!)  Secondly, most of the special features are recycled material.  I was really dissapointed with the section of Ape Merchanside and Ape Collections.  There are hundreds of ape collectibles and all they show are a few Mego figures and wind-up Medicom figures.  what a joke!  Then for the Ape Collections they show a few masks, facial appliances and costumes.  How weak!  I thought I would be seeing some actual collections.  Anyways, the movie is a classic, but once again the folks at Fox have butchered it's DVD release.",1075852800,2,944,4.63855421686747
1943980,2,B0000TPA4C,"It's nice to see that this movie is finally being released as an animorphic widescreen version, but ALL of the extras are already available on the BEHIND THE PLANET OF THE APES 2 DVD set. So those of us fans that already bought the Behind set are getting corn-holed. Buhahah... it figures.
And while were on the subject... hows about letting us have the damned ANIMATED Planet of the Apes series on DVD already!! Geez!",1073433600,8,418,4.586666666666667
1943981,5,B0000TPA4C,"The only film in the ""Apes"" series that is worth watching, the original ""Planet of the Apes"" has withstood the test o' time in many ways.  The FX make-up is still the standard against which the art is measured in modern films.  The set design, costumes, and acting are all brilliant, and don't seem corny or dated, even though the movie is almost fifty years old. And , of course, the famous ending scene never fails to shock, even after repeated viewings. A must-have for any serious sci-fi fan.",1360195200,2,496,4.561797752808989

1943983,5,B0000TPA4C,"The social criticism in the movie is a bit sophomoric at times--I don't think the satire is half as deep as the writers want it to be--but the astonishing make-up effects and Jerry Goldsmith's slam-bang score, along with that mind-blowing final image, push the movie over the top and give the ideas a visceral jolt they might not otherwise have. Some critic (maybe Pauline Kael) also noted that Charlton Heston's iconic profile reminds you of an American eagle--yet another visual touch that drives home the movie's points and gives the whole story resonance and meaning.",1331683200,,571,5.021052631578947
1943984,5,B0000TPA4C,"If you're a Planet of the Apes fan, you gotta have this 2-disc 35th Anniversary set in your library; not for the first disc, but the second one.

The first disc  has what you'd expect: the full-length sci-fi classic itself.

But the second disc offers a truly unusual gallery of supporting materials that will certainly enrich and deepen your enjoyment of this cult masterpiece.

My favorite Disc-Two materials include the 2-hour ""behind the scenes"" documentary hosted by Roddy McDowall; rare footage of dailies and outtakes; and again McDowall's on-set footage.

Both thumbs up.",1325376000,2,579,5.182795698924731
1943985,4,B0000TPA4C,"Adapted from Pierre Boulle's 1963 French novel, director Franklin Schaffner's Planet of the Apes stars Charlton Heston as a ""spaceman"" named Taylor, who, along with two other astronauts, finds himself on a mysterious planet run by intellectual apes. After eventually escaping the confines of the apes' prison, which still holds one of his earthly companions captive (the other is the local museum's latest addition), he ventures out into the planet's uncharted parts, where he makes a dire discovery that will make your stomach churn.

Planet of the Apes is a time-standing masterpiece of sociological complexities that gleams with on-screen beauty, lavish sets, brilliant costumes (which garnered an Oscar nod in '69), and enough action to appease a popcorn-movie hound. It is considered a vital piece of the sci-fi movement and preceded four sequels and a remake in 2001, none of which compares to its ingenuity. Still, none of the aforementioned qualities amount to its mind-blowing conclusion, one of the most eerie endings in film history.",1266364800,2,1044,5.327272727272727
1943986,4,B0000TPA4C,"First of all, if you can find it, you should buy this two-disk edition (the one with the silver cover), rather than the edition that seems to be more ubiquitous on Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-of-the-Apes/dp/B000E6ESEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet of the Apes</a>, since that one doesn't have all the goodies this has.  Unfortunately, I think the two-disk one is going out of print.

As for the movie itself, I don't think I'll be watching it again:  I know you're supposed to suspend your disbelief before you pop in a movie like this, but watching it in middle age, I couldn't get around the plot holes.  They were simply too enormous.  Sure, I know it's a classic movie and all.  And sure, when I was a teenager this really fired my imagination.

But this time around, the only thing I marveled at was how hoodwinked I had been before at such second-rate entertainment.  In this case, the plot-hole that triggered my dissatisfaction was the fact that Heston wasn't struck at all by the fact that the apes spoke English.  At least in Boulle's book, they spoke another language which he slowly had to learn.

I know that sounds like a minor matter, but once you start to notice that, a whole lot of other things seem to go wrong, until the point where you're just rolling your eyes instead of taking the movie on its own merits.

Another thing that seemed completely off was the direction:  think of the crashing-to-earth scene.  I realize they had a limited budget, but that has got to be some of the most inept direction I've ever seen.",1254528000,,1605,4.9440298507462686
1943987,4,B0000TPA4C,"I bought this Movie for my Husband, I am not particularly a Planet of the ape fan.  It was just what I wanted and I know he enjoyed the movie.

1943988,5,B0000TPA4C,"I was lucky enough to see this at the movies when it was re-released with Beneath the Planet of the Apes 1970. It made a huge impact on me at the time and I must admit I still love it. The original is a fantastic film and it blows the remake completely out of the water! The sequels, well.......they are kind of stupid, but I can't help but like them any way! I grew up with them and when you're young you are willing to let little things go...like continuity,inane dialog and unbelievable and contrived story lines. The first film is in a class all by itself. The make-up is great for the time and I still think for the most part holds up today. The sets are cool and Roddy,Kim and the rest of the main apes play there parts to the hilt! Heston is Heston and he can make anything seems like it is real! The 2 disc set has a really nice transfer and a load of extras.",1185926400,,867,4.076023391812866
1943989,5,B0000TPA4C,"As with most Rod Serling stories (he co-wrote this with Michael Wilson), a fundamental twist in the nature of things opens the door to pointed social commentary. The ruling apes exhibit the same fears, ignorance and prejudice as we civilized humans, only it stings a little more when you're on the wrong end of the whip. The film is gorgeously shot and briskly paced by director Schaffner, who'd go on to do ""Patton"". Kudos to 20th Century Fox on the quality of the restoration, as watching this pristine DVD felt like a whole new experience. Heston as the cynical Taylor makes an appealing hero, and Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter excel as kindly chimp couple Cornelius and Zira. That ""wow"" surprise ending is justly famous. Avoid the Wahlberg re-make.",1182988800,2,752,4.837209302325581
1943990,5,B0000TPA4C,"After the Sixth Sense came out, a star appeared on Late Night TV and literally spoiled the ending for everyone. Such was the case with me for Planet of the Apes. From its hideous VHS cover to that classic Simpsons parody (""I hate every ape I see, from Chimpan-A to Chimpan-Z""), the ending was spoiled long before I even watched the movie. And it didn't help that the film is often listed on classic movies everybody watched such as Psycho, Gone with the Wind and the Godfather. Well even if the ending was spoiled, I found the film incredibly enjoyable regardless.

4 astronauts crash land on a planet, one being killed during the crash. Very desolate and seemingly void of life. However, there exists a primitive era race of men who are hunted by intelligent apes. An oppressive society against men, the apes have little tolerance of man so when one of the astronauts, Taylor, manages to surprise them by being able to talk and reason, he becomes public enemy number 1.

Like I said, the twist was spoiled long before these eyes watched the film so as I'm watching, I was actually surprised by how obvious it seems at times. There's a doll, horses, automatic weapons which made me think ""people were surprised by the ending?"" However it is quite an effective ending and the image of the...thing is quite poignant. It's probably best if you were living in a cave, or you're 13 and never saw the movie, been spoiled...or seen that episode of the Simpsons.

While it does have the occasional action, its really surprising the film completely draws you in simply by talking. Similar to walking in someone's house and feeling the need to browse, you get interested and drawn in by the ape-run world. The only minor distraction is that the apes tend to be fairly similar to the next one and their mouths aren't exactly the most articulate but again, minor distractions.

It's definately worth a watch and you should check it out and the 35th Anniversary seems appropriate...that is if Fox decides on a 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray/HD-DVD release.",1156291200,2,2037,4.729577464788733
1943991,5,B0000TPA4C,"Oh, man...I love this movie. I can watch it over and over and over again and still find it absolutely fascinating. I love the Charleston Heston character; Taylor. He's so anti-human himself and then winds up on a planet where ""the only good human is a dead human..."" I am well aware of the fact this particular line is from the second movie, but even before that line was even uttered you got the feeling that this was the overall attitude of the inhabitants.

The part that still gets me is the ending. I remember watching it with my dad for the first time on network television; that scene played out and my dad let out an audible gasp. It was just totally ironic. Taylor has discovered the destiny of the human race. It still sends chills up my spine just thinking about it.

The Tim Burton remake was absolutely horrid. My friend and went to go see that piece of monkey **** only to drive home and rewatch the original. Maybe Tim Burton needs to enroll in some kind of class where they can teach him some of the basics on how to make movies.

Stick with the classic original. Even if you're not into science fiction you will find this movie to be absolutely incredible. Everything from the writing, to the shot locations, to the screenwriting is total and complete perfection.",1155859200,13,1280,4.484978540772532
1943992,5,B0000TPA4C,"This was so very clever, probably even better than the novel by Pierre Boule.  The entire premise is just so clever, so smart.  The music and scoring is superb.  The acting is great.  The make-up for its time was also dynamite.  Overall, it was just a great combo of scary and intellectual.  And the final shot of the statue of liberty: I'd argue it's one of the greatest, most recognizable, single shots in the history of movies.  Just a fantastic movie!  Everyone should see it.",1152403200,5,480,4.564705882352941
1943993,5,B0000TPA4C,"I am slowly collecting DVDs of all the classic horror/science fiction movies I loved as a kid....Planet of the Apes was one of my favorites. I saw a version of it several years ago on cable tv that looked quite dated due to the poor picture quality. I was hesistant to order this DVD package but I took a risk given the positive reviews I read by others here. Well, my skepticism disappeared quickly after about five minutes into this picture. Quite frankly, I just could not believe the picture quality of this DVD!!! It looks like it was made yesterday! The Western location shots utilized during the first portion of the movie look visually stunning and breath-taking just as if I was observing it for the first time in a movie theatre. The sound quality is quite excellent as well.... Although there are heavy handed moments given its over the top message, the 35th anniversary easily holds it own and packs a powerful and timely message. Planet of the Apes offers a textbook lesson on power, prejudice and acceptance. Readers may disagree with me, but I also think that this is one of Heston's best performances on film.  As far as plot and pacing, you get an exciting thrill ride of action and suspense rooting for ""Taylor"" in a battle of wits against the ruling ape hierarchy. Oh yeah, the ending (in the top 10 of all time movie endings) ain't too shabby either! Highly recommended...",1149206400,14,1392,4.635627530364372
1943994,2,B0000TPA4C,"1968'S ""Planet of the Apes"", based on the book by Pierre Boulle and starring Charleton Heston, Roddy Macdowall, and (predictably) alot of evil simians, is, despite a few compelling moments and it's reputation as a ""sci-fi masterpiece"", an over-rated, inconsistent, clumsily-paced allegory, a movie ultimately more successful in concept than execution.
  But it's a fascinating concept: a group of astronauts, led by the tooth-gritting, gun-toting Heston and featuring what are surely two of the most wooden performances in a modern-day feature (fortunately Heston's comrades are soon picked off and lobotomized, thereby salvaging the picture from near-destruction), crash-land on what appears to be a distant planet dominated by a race of hyper-intelligent apes to whom the local population of apparently retarded humans are enslaved. (Considering the Apes supposed intelligence, it's enigmatic how their cities are built of stone and their only available means of transportation are primitive horse-and-buggies. Amish apes?).
 After a prolongued stretch of unconvincing dialogue, and after being separated from his fellow astronauts, the unwitting Heston is taken into captivity, though fortunately not without a sexy non-verbal human girl with whom the apes have provided him and who keeps him company throughout the movie (in addition to the many valuable insights it provides into prejudice and the brutality of human nature, ""Planet of the Apes"" serves as a reminder that having one's friend's lobotomized, being treated like an animal and incarcerated in a straw-filled jail-cell in the distant future on a planet controlled by malevolent talking apes can be an endurable, even pleasant experience, as long as one is afforded the comforts of a subservient human chick with whom one can mate.)
  Fortunately, Heston happens upon a pair of benevolent chimpanzee scientist's who discover his intelligence and embark on a quest to convince the ape community, particularly the disbelieving and contemptuous Dr. Zaius (who actually looks sort of like a peculiar combination of Jerry Stiller and Alfred Hitchcock in a cheap monkey costume). Ultimately, at the film's conclusion, and in what is probably it's most powerful moment, Heston makes a by-now fairly well known but still shocking revelation. The inclusion of this ironic twist isn't surprising: the screenplay was written by Rod Serling, of ""Twilight-Zone"" fame, who managed to inject enough of his show's trademark philosophical inventiveness and ""what-if"" creepiness into ""Planet"" for it to be, from a contemporary standpoint, a more-or-less watchable experience.",1148947200,2,2623,5.630379746835443
1943995,5,B0000TPA4C,"I watced this film many, many times over the years and have always greatly enjoyed it. With this 35th anniversary disc, it's the first time I've REALLY WATCHED IT. The colors, the shadows of this beautiful anamorphic widescreen took me to another level. If your a classic sci-fi buff, you know exactly what I'm writting about. The sound is as rich as it will probably ever be, and with the right home theatre hook up your itching ears will be satisfied.

  This is the result when things are done right. There are alot of so called dvds out there, but this is how the format was truely intended to be expressed, before quick packaging make a buck took over. Fox and other companies occasionally get it. The film is easily in the top 5 of the grandest sci-fi films ever done. Now, watch it in all its splendour as the otherworldly feel envelops you with all its social, religious, political and downright crushing futuristic embrace. More good news is that ""Beneath"" is on the horizon with the supposed same treatment as ""Planet"".

  But as true retrospectors of quality sci-fi we know that the ape films stop there, and the sillyness starts.  The days of Mr. Heston and that feel of the 60s concept are long gone, but the film exists. Lets hope filmakers can get on the right track again with original science fiction that boggles the mind.

  P.S.- And I'm not an evolutionist.",1143072000,4,1378,4.610655737704918
1943996,5,B0000TPA4C,"I finally got around to watching the DVD, and the film looks great, and it reminded me that a lot of the sci-fi films from the 60s and 70s had more of a message than the effects heavy sci fi films post Star Wars (which is really a samurai film in space..it all goes back to John Ford tho').

The only disappointment was that Heston didn't take part in the commentary.

But the ""bonus"" DVD is what makes this edition worth picking up. You find out where the movie was filmed (some of it's the same location that they would use for the M*A*S*H TV series). The 2 hour documentary incorporates some of the DVD extra footage, like Edward G Robinson in the ape costume (who would quit right before filming), and the future husband of La Streisand, James Brolin. McDowell, who narrates the documentary, gives his home movie footage to us all, showing the actors hanging about as well as the application of the makeup, and goes into detail not just about this film, but the entire Apes franchise, including clips from the TV show and cartoon prior to Tim Burton's version (which is not mentioned anywhere as far as I know).

1943997,5,B0000TPA4C,"This is one of those stories where you conveniently ignore some of the absurdities of the plot with no ill effect on the experience.  I'm talking about the lack of surprise or recognition by the astronauts at the blue sky, breathable air, humanoids, Earth-like gravity, terrain and animals, and the fact that the apes speak 20th century English, for Pete's sake, with ape mouths incapable of speech.  It just doesn't matter.  Rod Serling claimed not to have intended to create a morality play, but it is just the same.  The ""see no evil, hear...."" scene with the orangutans was supposed to have happened spontaneously - give me a break.  But the obvious class comparisons to modern society are right on, if a bit transparent.  The struggle of scientific inquiry vs dogma, yada yada yada.  What I REALLY find brilliant about this movie is the way the orangutans (ostensibly the ""ee-vill white male Republicans"") who seemed so arbitrarily hateful and fearful of man are proven completely justified in the last scene.  So by the end we have another apocalyptic view of the possible future, along with Soylent Green, the Omega Man, the Andromeda Strain, THX-1138, Silent Running, 2001, and others of that generation.  And the make-up alone is genius, as well as the brilliant 20th century symphonic score, which simultaneously sounds primitive and modern, grounding us in the 20th century - ""home"" to the main characters.",1140220800,,1417,4.995744680851064
1943998,5,B0000TPA4C,"In recent years sci-fi have been filled with flashing lights, high-budget CGI effects and ridiculous stunts like in THE MATRIX and I, ROBOT. If you don't like one sci-fi film, you're unlikely to like any as they're all the same. However, my dad took down PLANET OF THE APES from our video shelf. Unlike most sci-fi films, it was made in a time that had to deal without CGI and relied completely on the break through movie make-up as well as providing what people have voted time and time again ""The Greatest Film Ending"". PLANET OF THE APES has a cast of the greatest, easy storyline and it keeps your attention even as the credits are rolling at the end. Based on Pierre Boulle's lesser novel (La Plante des singes AKA Monkey Planet) tells of an astronaut landing on a distant planet and discovering that man's role as the superior life form has been reversed with the apes. The film has many needed changes to it to make it more watch-able and tap into the true fears at the time the film was made. In 1968, everyone lived in fear of an atomic bomb attack and PLANET OF THE APES truly taps into that fear, for reasons I will not reveal but it is understandable why the story was so popular at the time and why it shocked everyone.

PLANET OF THE APES tells the story of George Taylor (Charlton Heston), when he and his doomed astronaut friends find themselves stranded on a distant planet. It seems to be inhospitable with no life. However, after traveling throughout the place, which is famously referred to as ""The Forbidden Zone"", discover plenty of life including ape like humans and human like apes. Taylor is shot in the neck rendering him unable to speak. Treated as a wounded animal, he is taken to a human-ape study lab where he meets Zira (Kim Hunter), a sympathetic, friendly and intelligent chimpanzee. She almost straight away notices that Taylor's intelligence goes far beyond that of any other human, and she encourages him to speak. However, orangutan leader Dr Zaius, sneers on Zira's and her fianc Cornelius' (Roddy McDowall) belief in any human intelligence, and won't listen to reason. Despite Cornelius' skeptical feelings towards Taylor, agrees to help prove his intelligence which only proved once he finally says his famous line: ""Take your stinking paws of me you damn dirty ape!"" Heston is anything other then a likable character. Unlike Ulysse Merou in the novel, Taylor isn't a polite, slightly moody, clever and likable character who values his friendship with Zira and Cornelius. He represents what we, as humans truly are, that is self-centered, violent and dangerous. Though on stage he is reportedly (according to Laurence Olivier) truly a talented actor, on screen and in PLANET OF THE APES, Heston basically turned up and like in many of his other films played himself. Nonetheless the character of Taylor works as you either love him or you hate him. Just like every other work Heston did, the rebel Taylor is no different from the other pushy characters Heston has played over the years. As a sort of physical god-like body, you suppose that the film where the apes are pushing us humans about cause we're basically behaving like apes is just what the doctor ordered.

Of course we all know that it's the two lovable chimps Zira and Cornelius that we remember the most in the PLANET OF THE APES films for their charm and humor they bring to the story. Hunter's portrayal of Zira was a masterpiece on it's own, giving the most powerful performance of its time. It's fair to say that Zira is the strongest and most well developed character in the film. Indeed she's the only ape that Taylor seems to actually like! With her strong-mindedness, wit and admirable sense of humor it's not surprising most people who are asked who their favorite character reply ""Zira"". Hunter manages to make the character just how Zira was meant to be, more human then ape. In fact, she's more human then most of the beautiful female actresses in the other classic 60's films, despite the fact she looks as ugly as hell in her ape make-up. The charm still shines through.

Of course, if you don't love the intelligent and cool Zira, you always have intelligent and nerdy Cornelius. McDowell, next to Heston, is one of the most credited male actors in the films as he comes over as the sort of nerd of the rebel gang that you just want to hug. In the film, Taylor seems to have a love-hate rivalry relationship with Cornelius as they constantly challenge each other like full-blooded males do no matter how civilized we get. A good example of this is when Zira allows Taylor to kiss her on the lips as a goodbye and Cornelius makes his jealousy clear. However Taylor sticks up for him against Zaius, which shows not as much friendship as understanding. McDowell is the most credited actor in any PLANET OF THE APES version be it this, the sequels or the TV series and is an irreplaceable member of the cast who is impossible to live up to.

PLANET OF THE APES is a mark in cinema history, famous for these talented artists, gripping story line and amazing ending that shocks you, scares you, breaks you and brings you to tears with the realization that you'll never truly experience a film like this again. Anyone who is anyone owes it to himself or herself to watch this film and experience the feeling. Even people who dislike sci-fi are likely to enjoy this. A film that truly did break STAR WARS and challenged it like no other film ever could. PLANET OF THE APES will live on in all of us. It will go on forever, find its way to younger audiences and will win them over just it won over us.",1138492800,4,5611,4.624874623871615

(Note that this review is for the 35TH Anniversary DVD Edition of this movie released by Fox Home Entertainment in Feb. 2004.)

This movie, based on the excellent and imaginative 1963 novel of the same name by French author Pierre Boulle, is about four astronauts who crash-land on an unknown planet in the year 3978.  One dies in the spacecraft and the three remaining astronauts Commander Taylor (Charlton Heston), Dodge (Jeff Burton), and Landon (Robert Gunner) explore the planet that according to Taylor is ""320 light years from Earth...in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.""

These three soon discover a terrifying truth: this ""madhouse"" planet is ruled by intelligent apes that hunt primitive, mute humans.  The ones they don't kill for sport are captured and used in scientific experiments that leave those experimented on either in a vegetative state or dead.

Dodge is not so fortunate in a hunt (where gorillas hunt humans) but Landon, Taylor and a mute woman Taylor befriends named Nova (Linda Harrison) are captured and brought back to Ape City.  Luckily, Taylor or ""Bright Eyes"" meets two open-minded chimpanzee scientists Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) and Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) that try to protect him due to his obvious uniqueness from the close-minded orangutan High Minister of Science Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans). Unfortunately, Landon was not so lucky.

Dr. Zaius is also the Minister of Religion who keeps the sacred scrolls of the ape ""Lawgiver.""  (These scrolls are like the human Bible.)  One of these scrolls provides a warning:

""Beware the beast Man, for he is the Devil's pawn, alone among God's primates.  He kills for sport or lust or greed.  Yea he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land.  Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours.  Shun him, drive him back into his jungle lair, for he is the harbinger of death.""

This movie is grand entertainment from its visually stimulating beginning to its chilling, unforgettable last moment where Taylor, realizing what's happened, yells ""Damn you, God damn you all to Hell.""  It is a first-rate science fiction adventure that both thrills and poses to the viewer some soul-searching questions.

The acting is superb.  This was Linda Harrison's first movie role.  All actors in their ape make-up do good acting jobs especially Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall.  Special mention should go to Maurice Evans for his fine performance as the stern Dr. Zaius.  The legendary Charlton Heston carries the movie as the cynical Taylor.

The ape make-up is very convincing.  It's obvious why this movie won an Honorary Academy Award for Outstanding Make-up Achievement.

The spell-binding background music definitely adds to each scene.  It's easy to see why this movie was nominated for an Oscar for Original Score.

The brilliant screenplay for this movie was co-written by the late, great Rod Serling and it shows on-screen.

This DVD picture and sound are exceptional (certainly better than my VHS version).  There are eighteen extras in the form of such things as commentaries, documentaries, promos, outtakes, and galleries.

Finally, there is a sequel to this movie called ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (1970) also on DVD.  There are also three prequels to this movie made in the early 1970s.  A ""remake"" of this original 1968 movie was also made in 2001.  (Actually, there is no similarity between the remake and the original.)  Charlton Heston and Linda Harrison were the only actors from the original to appear in this ""remake.""

In conclusion, this is a unique, exciting movie that makes you think and is now on a special DVD.  Never has Ape City looked so good!!  Also see why Charlton Heston yells the memorable line, ""Take your stinking paws off me, you damn, dirty ape!""

I know it was a woman and she had died already but she was there.  Imagine, in a 1967 movie they show a woman being sent on this none returning mission with three men.  As Charlton Heston character stated: ""And she was suppose to be the new Eve, with our hot and eager help of course.""

So, try to look closer at the movie the next time and you will see that there was a fourth astronaut.",1109548800,,538,4.184466019417476
1944004,5,B0000TPA4C,"""Planet of the Apes"" is one of the deepest pschological sci fi adventures of all time. The film is based off the classic series of novels Planet of the Apes. The story is basically about these three astronauts that are sent out into space, but they somehow end up several years into the future to come home to a world dominated by apes. Two of the astronauts are eventually killed by the intellectual primates, so Jake Taylor (Charleton Heston) is the only survivor. Taylor is soon caught in a world where man is no longer the dominant species and finds himself trying to survive in a world gone ape. The film offers a lot of great qualities like acting, plot, directing, make up (for that time period), and set designs were simply beautiful. With great scenes like when Taylor says, ""Get your hands off me! You damn dirty ape!"" Or the classic unforgettable ending. Despite a few dated make up on the actors portraying the apes and story being paced, it's still a great film to watch.

I think this is better than the remake. See both if you want, however.",1108425600,3,1056,4.528795811518324
1944005,5,B0000TPA4C,"... and never trust a guy in an ape suit, either!

Although I am a science fiction fan, somehow I didn't get around to seeing this movie until last night. I was astounded at how well it came across. I thought it would be terribly dated, even laughable. I was wrong!

The themes in this movie are universal and timeless. As a vegetarian and a supporter of animal rights, I wanted to stand up and cheer at many of the points made. The costumes and special effects were actually pretty good, and the dialogue was well done.

The surprise ending still packed a punch. I'd say, buy this version because it's widescreened -- you don't want to watch this classic panned & scanned. Then, sit back and enjoy a true science fiction classic with themes still important to us today. It will be a refreshing experience.",1106006400,2,806,4.506849315068493
1944006,5,B0000TPA4C,"Planet of the Apes is the perfect brew. The film presents so many potentially weak links that you'd think at least of one of them would fail. Nu-uh-uh.

Franklin Schaffner's direction is unrelentingly fresh and exploratory. The screenplay by Rod Serling and others presents a perfect blend of intelligence and entertainment. The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith remains original to this day. Charlton Heston was perfect in a lead role requiring a balance of arrogance and humility. All of the Ape characters are portrayed with great freedom of expression and with precision. (Maurice Evans is particularly perfect in his role). Even Linda Harrison gives the perfect mix of primitiveness and innocence to her ""cave girl"" character. In short, the film contains a large supporting cast and everyone of them contributes significantly to the scenes in which they are included.

The film is well known for its not-so-subtle and (most importantly) entertaining social commentary. At no time, however, does the ""commentary"" overwhelm the film or take itself too seriously. In an odd way, Heston's portrayal is pivotal in giving such dimension to the social themes because he was both one of the film's greatest supporters and similtaneously cast in a role that was quite ""un-Heston"" like. On many levels, Heston's character was the antithesis of the character with which he is normally associated (i.e., hero and defender of national tradition).

The only ""weak"" links in the entire package (referring to the 35th Anniversary DVD edition) are the commentaries. Neither commentary track is a true commentary, but rather includes brief blocks of dialogue scattered over the film's two-hour running time. The ""commentary"" is mostly non-scene specific and even sounds like a collection of pre-existing statements edited in over certain portions of the film. Only Eric Greene's text commentary lives up to the package.",1104969600,4,1905,5.322259136212624
1944007,5,B0000TPA4C,"Planet of the Apes is a great ""What if"" tale. There have been oodles of movies where the heroic space travelers lurch forward in time to find earth in a completely different state. But when ""Apes"" was released and we found that the planet was ruled by monkeys, that took the cake! Charlton Heston is one of our heroic space travelers here. The theory of talking ape evolution is very interesting even if not very likely. In one of the later of the Ape series we find that humans are using apes to perform menial tasks but an uprising takes place. They are not only used as slave labor but mistreated as well. Monkey racism I guess you'd call it. That uprising is spearheaded by Ceasar, a talking chimpanzee (played by the late Roddy McDowall).

The series takes us forwards and backwards to show us how the simian race was able to take over in the first place. Unfortunately, the later films in the series are not the same caliber as the first but some of you may still find them enteraining nonetheless.

As for the first Ape film, you would expect that the ape makeup would count for 90% of the acting but gratefully, the acting is top notch in spite of the makeup jobs. The ending really blows you away because you're involved in the film so much that you aren't trying to figure out where the astronauts have landed. You just want to know why the monkeys are talking. Also interesting is that the apes have their own heirarchy. The gorillas are the brutes so they are all soldiers. The chimps are intelligent so they are the scientists and the orangutangs are the elite so they rule the land.

There are a lot of extras here.  Good stuff, not the stuff they threw on the floor while making the film.  The documentaries are interesting to watch as well as the creation of the facial makeup.  The process was brutal.  Once the makeup was applied, the actor had to stay in it until shooting for the day was over.  If they wanted to eat, most of what they ate had to be sipped through a straw.  There are cast interviews and Roddy McDowalls home movies as well.  Lots of fun stuff here.

1944008,2,B0000TPA4C,"Even though I was old enough to have seen the original movie in theatres, I never did.  I finally saw it on dvd because the critic in Entertainment Weekly talked about how great the ""surprise ending"" was.
I'll keep this short.  You'd have to be pretty dim to buy into the premise that Heston's character......supposedly a scientist.....wouldn't at least suspect that he might be on earth.  There was so much evidence to that effect.  So the ending is not a surprise at all.  You can see it coming hours away.  Aside from that, the movie is just very lame.  I had a tough time forcing myself to watch it all the way through.  Bad acting, bad dialog, bad plot.  Nuff said.  You're either with me or against me..:-).........p.s. I find it amusing the way all the POTA lovers out there can only express their hurt by indicating that my review was not helpful.  Boo hoo!",1095292800,2,865,4.516129032258065
1944009,5,B0000TPA4C,"This film is absolutely brilliant in every respect.  Heston is great in the lead, and I don't see why everybody bashes him.  The concept is great, the ending is great, and it's easily in my top three films of all time.  Also, anybody who says the newer Planet of the Apes is better should be shot because Tim Burton absolutely killed this classic.",1094774400,4,347,4.476190476190476
1944010,5,B0000TPA4C,"Franklin Shaffner's 1968 adaptation of Pierre Boulle's (author of 'Bridge On The River Kwai')science-fiction satire still makes audiences ponder on questions of human nature even after almost 40 years with its brilliant script and great special effects.

The story follows George Taylor (Charleton Heston) and his 3 crew mates who've been travelling the stars at light speed in suspended animation.  The spaceship is programmed to land back on an Earth that is centuries older but something goes terribly wrong: a system failure leads their ship to land in a desolate sea on an unknown planet.  As the crew members salvage what they can from their sinking ship, their hopes of ever returning home go down to the depths along with their ship.  After some exploration, the disoriented astronauts realize that they aren't alone.  On this new planet, apes are the only intelligent life while human hunter-gatherers live like flocks of mute sheep.  Captured by the apes, Taylor speaks out and sends shockwaves through the ape society's scientific community.  Securing the friendship of two chimp scientists named Cornelius (McDowell) and Zera (Hunter), Taylor seeks to save his life and that of his new silent soul-mate Nova (Harrison) against the fanatical Dr. Zeuss (Evans.)  Will he escape this world gone ape?  What will he find if he does?

With a brilliant script written by the legendary Rod Serling of Twilight Zone fame, the audience is plunged into the depths of this political/social satire.  The film explores the concepts of human nature and its fallacies manifested in social institutions such as religion, science, and government.  The film is an attack on preconceptions as to human nature and its place in the universe. Although the film significantly deviates from Boulle's short story, it is far superior to Tim Burton's recent bubble gum adaptation that offers a true satire as opposed to a mindless and generic sci-fi action plot with no theme.  Also, the make-up and costumes in this version are actually more convicing than the glossy and static CGI enhancements in the new film.

This is perhaps one of the rare instances where the film is better than the novel that inspired it.  Boulle's novel is short and leaves the plot somewhat lacking as to it characters just as much as the film lacks more detail as to the ape society Taylor finds himself in.  The film somewhat wins over in this comparative deficiency by developing Taylor's character.  Also, the characters in the film being professional astronauts make more sense than Boulle's eccentric scientist and his crew of amateurs.  Focusing the story on Earth instead of another planet and changing the final scene in the film has a greater thematic impact than the one in Boulle's novel.  An interesting fact that both the novel and film seem to ignore is the disparity in physical strength between humans and apes.  If apes would indeed socially evolve to replace humans then humans would be at a serious disadvantage as apes are much stronger in terms of physical strength and so the scenes where Taylor is wrestling free from the clutches of several gorillas is pretty much an impossibility.  The film making the apes less evolved than in the novel also seems to work better.

Overall, this is a great film that, despite its changes, conveys most of the theme in the novel and actually does better than the novel in its plot.  A timeless film to be enjoyed by all ages.",1092700800,5,3447,4.956521739130435
1944011,5,B0000TPA4C,"In the authority chain, you may distinguish the clear diference between the apes too.
One spacial navy suddenly falls in a hole time and it's carried hundred years after. The landing in a unknown planet, carries to these man and it shows them a world ruled by apes who dictate its own rules and have established the official story.
The man is under them in the evolutive chain. The men have lost his speaking capacity and they only make gutural sounds. Their state is something less than pitiful.
George Taylor is wounded in his throat and that's why he can not articulate even a single word.
The dramatic sequences in the same point he pronounces the first word,(Do you remember the miracle worker and the wild child?) creates a true revolution among the ape scientist. This behavior are against the rules. The law is the law.(The island of Dr. Moreau)
And so, Taylor is involved in a constant fight for surviving. His friends can not help him anymore , one is dead and the other suffered a lobotomy.
The dramatic ideas exchange between Taylor and the master science of the ape comunity include hilarious bits and obviously undeniable conflicts between the science and the faith. Forget all you learned about Darwin and please watch the mirror image. All the concepts are reverted and so the anguish and the poor human condition is less than zero.
Finally our hero wins? and he can carry Nova his only possibilitie for sow the next human seed generational, but he will find out the astonishing revelation.
Since its release, this film involved just once more the fever for new concepts and ideas. Fahrenheit 451 (1967) and 2001 was released the same year and the world was in a decisive turning point. The man conquers the moon and the screen must be part of this decisive event.
So the people turns back over Asimov, Bradbury, Boulle, Stanoslav Lem and will  read over and will find out new universes, bitter nightmares spacials. In a very close state the fifties had a coommon behavior. The ancient films of sci fi were released, and others were remade. We had to expect four years for Solaris directed by Tarkovski in 1972.
In this sense, you can not forget the political behavior in many countries in that age. There were many dictators all around the world , and the figure of the ape was a clear methapor of them.
Undoubtly, you may be find the film , thirty years after, a little bit aged, but the dramatic implications that a nuclear conflict involves, still feed the imagination of many people.
Charlton Heston was a true icon of rthe anti hero in the fifties (with his religious films) and in the sixties (with historical roles), then he would make another war films but keeping always that undeniable majesty for make prevailing the truth, no matter what's the prize you pay.
Sensational direction of Franklin Schaffner and arresting sequences, like the human chase and the scape from the jail (or the concentration camps) .

Many people are complaining this film is too confusing for some, but I must point out that ONLY TIM BURTONS VERSION WAS CONFUSING. I will now explain the ending to those who were confused...
Future humans waged an atomic war againts themselves, destroying the most of the species. Apes however, survived and built a new civilization. Over time, the humans became stupid.
Story:
A time warped astronaut (Heston) crash lands on a world where apes rule over a primitive race of humans.  He then must rely on two chimps (McDowell Hunter) to escape from the planet.
Whats Good:
 Pretty much everything. The story is respectable for a sci-fi film of the 60's, delivering a good message, and haunting finale. Alos, it stands it's own when giving out some great qoutations I.E. Damn them, Damn them all to hell. Notthing to violent,, good for the family. Very thought provoking
Whats Bad:
The ape make-up takes sometime to get used to. Although not laughable, it is alittle odd. Also, the opening walk through the desert is a wopping 30 minutes. It does a fair job of standing it's own against the book, but not as good.

Probably the best, most effective portrayal of the dangers of religion. Charlton Heston is wonderful in his role, and a great action hero. I got really involved in this movie - at times i was so twisted up and fearful for Heston's life and frustrated by the repressive nature of the Ape state.

1944015,4,B0000TPA4C,"20th Century Fox released the film previously on DVD by itself and in a box set with the rest of the Apes films plus a bonus DVD of extras. Now, for those who just want the first (and best) film of the series and all of the extras, Fox has released an excellent two-DVD special edition of Planet of the Apes to celebrate its 35th anniversary.
The DVD's extras get off to a shaky start with the two lackluster audio commentaries. The first is by legendary composer, Jerry Goldsmith, and the second by actors Roddy McDowall, Natalie Trundy, Kim Hunter and make-up artist John Chambers. Both commentaries could benefit from some extensive editing. There is way too much dead air that one has to sit through to get to the few interesting tidbits of information. The DVD producers should have edited down these commentaries to only the scenes in the movie that are actually commented on, like with the audio tracks on the Glengarry Glen Ross and The Right Stuff DVDs.
The text commentary by Eric Greene, author of Planet of the Apes as American Myth, redeems things by cramming a ton of interesting factoids on the screen in the form of subtitles. It's scary when the text commentary is better than both audio commentaries combined.
The second DVD contains the bulk of the extra material. The first section, ""Exploring the Apes,"" contains a comprehensive, two-hour documentary entitled, ""Behind the Planet of the Apes."" Hosted by Roddy McDowall, it takes a look at the entire Apes saga from the films to the cartoon and TV series with an emphasis on the first (and best) film. Fans of the Apes films will be delighted to see all the major players from the films back for new interviews done exclusively for this documentary.
Also included in this section is the make-up test reel with Edward G. Robinson that convinced the 20th Century Fox brass to pony up the money for the film. There is ""Roddy McDowall Home Movies"" taken while making the first Apes movie that shows the step-by-step application of his ape make-up. There are 19 minutes of dailies and outtakes from the film.
There are also two vintage featurettes from 1968 and 1972 respectively. They are nothing more than superficial promos but are now fascinating time capsules of their times. Finally, there are two brief featurettes that showcase footage of directors Don Taylor and J. Lee Thompson shooting a scene from the Apes films that they worked on. These last two extras feel like unnecessary padding.
The ""Publicity"" section contains theatrical trailers for all of the Apes films, two glowing reviews for The Planet of the Apes and a collection of movie posters from all around the world.
The ""Galleries"" section features sketches by costume designer Morton Haack and a small stills gallery.
Finally, the ""Ape Phenomenon"" offers a brief glimpse into the vast Apes merchandising empire with a gallery of action figures. Also included is a collection of costumes and make-up from the films.
This new two-DVD set does justice to this landmark science fiction film. The transfer is amazing clear and free of any artifacting. The movie also hasn't sounded better with a crystal clear 5.1 surround soundtrack. While the audio commentaries are a let down, the two-hour documentary more than makes up for it. This is well worth picking up if you are a fan of the first film and want all the supplemental materials included in the box set without having to pay the extra money for the inferior sequels.",1079568000,36,3456,4.81986531986532
1944016,5,B0000TPA4C,"The brainchild of producer Arthur P. Jacobs, 1968's filmic adaptation of Pierre Boulle's novel LA PLAN&Egrave;TE DES SINGES (PLANET OF THE APES) is a superior mix of action, suspense, and satire that is today deservedly regarded as a science-fiction classic.  Franklin Schaffner's dynamic direction is brilliant, and the script by Michael Wilson and Rod Serling (yes, THE Rod Serling) is simultaneously witty and thought-provoking.  In the lead (human) role, Charton Heston delivers one of his best and most convincing performances, and accomplished thespians such as Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, and Maurice Evans give outstanding supporting performances that help make the film's fantastic plot believable.  Also contributing to the film's genuine simian aesthetics is Jerry Goldsmith's musical score, the style of which has since been frequently imitated but was at the time  so daring and unique that it was almost considered avant-garde.
The plot of PLANET OF THE APES is actually a subtle satirical socio-political allegory that addresses the hotbed of civil-rights and racial-equality issues of the late 1960s (and of today, to a lesser degree).  On a broader level, the film's subtext also addresses the injustices of class stratification in modern Western society that tends to be drawn along religions, political, financial, and educational lines.  Occasionally the film also touches on other disputatious socio-political issues, such as women's rights or the humane and ethical treatment of animals.
Heston plays George Taylor, an American astronaut who awakens from cryogenic sleep to discover that his spaceship has crash-landed on a world where gorillas, chimps, and orangutans have evolved into the planet's dominant intelligence.  In this simian dystopia, orangutan's are the governing members, with ultimate authority over the direction of scientific advancement, the establishment of religious theology, AND the interrelation of the two; the chimpanzees are the scientists and engineers, but they are subjugated by the orangutans; and gorillas, at the bottom of the social ladder, are the soldiers and menial laborers.  (The film's primary race-relations satire is obviously allegorized here: The orangutans are light-haired and light-skinned; the chimps are light-skinned but dark-haired; and the gorillas are dark-haired AND dark-skinned.)  Much to his dismay, Taylor learns the hard way that apes have supremacy over homo sapiens--who themselves are little more than mute tree-dwelling brutes--and regard them as the most vulgar and reprehensible animals on the planet.  Indeed, humans are hunted for sport and used in all manner of vile medical and scientific experiments.
In the late 1960s, some critics claimed that the plot structure for PLANET OF THE APES was really just an embellished rehash of an episode of TV's TWILIGHT ZONE in which astronauts from Earth are kept as exhibits in an alien zoo, and they supported this argument by pointing out that the script was co-written by the TV show's creator, Rod Serling.  With the television episode, a situation is created that forces the audience consider the possibility that humans might not be the most advanced life-form in the universe.  In PLANET OF THE APES, however, the entire animal kingdom is turned upside-down, with mankind now at the very bottom, so that via allegory and satire, the Western socio-political structure can be dissected and its faults  ""safely"" exposed.
To help the audience suspend their disbelief and thereby give in to the fantasy of the film, stunning simian make-up was designed and engineered by John Chambers.  Using a combination of latex appliances, custom wigs, and conventional make-up, Chambers was able to transform actors into convincing apes while still allowing them to maintain articulation with a good portion of their facial muscles.  While make-up FX have come a long way since then, his work was innovative and groundbreaking, and many of today's make-up experts--including Rick Baker, who designed the fantastically realistic ape make-up for Tim Burton's 2001 ""re-imagining"" of PLANET OF THE APES--have said that Chambers' work in this film inspired them to pursue the art of make-up as a career.  Chambers went on to win the Oscar for his efforts that year, only the second make-up person to do so, and it was chiefly his work on this film that lead the Academy to establish a permanent make-up category for the awards.
The 2-disc Anniversary DVD from Fox Home Entertainment will make any film lover go ape!  It offers a beautiful anamorphic widescreen transfer of the film from an excellently preserved print, as well as TONS of extras.  One of those extras is the documentary BEHIND THE PLANET OF THE APES, which itself has been offered for sale at a standard DVD price BUT WITHOUT THE FILM included!  Now you get both.  The audio feature commentaries are a bit of a let down, as there are long gaps without any commentary at all.  However, a text-based commentary by film historian Eric Greene is also included, and it can run simultaneously with one of the audio commentaries and thereby fill in the gaps.
All in all, PLANET OF THE APES is one of the best SF films of the latter 20th century, primarily because of the great acting, top-notch directing, excellent make-up, and an intelligent and socially relevant script.  It still plays as well today as it did nearly four decades ago.  And the 2-disc Anniversary DVD from Fox is reasonably priced and, with all the cool extras, provides hours of simian-based entertainment.",1078272000,13,5554,5.286363636363636
1944017,4,B0000TPA4C,"As for the DVD...I question some of the choices that were made by 20th century fox.  For anyone who doesn't know the film, ""Planet of the Apes"" is based off of the Pierre Boulle novel, also author of the acclaimed The Bridge Over the River Kwai.  In the film, Taylor (Charlton Heston), the captain of an expedition crew in deep space, is about to set the ship on a direct course home and put himself into hyper sleep.  However, as he goes to sleep, something goes terribly wrong and the space ship crash lands on an unknown world 2000 years in the future ""give or take a decade"".  Now, everything that Taylor believes in is about to get tested as his very search for something ""better than man"" pits him face to face with a planet of apes that DO consider themselves ""better than man"".
The film also stars the late Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter as the pair of scientist apes that befriend Taylor and help him discover why apes rule this planet and why this intense hatred for man exists.
When released in 1968, (alongside the release of Kubrick's Sci-fi epic 2001) the film was met with huge success (as well as controversy) due to the political and social commentary apparent in the film.  And while the film is nigh on 37 years old, those commentaries are as true today as they were in the 60's and 70's.  And what really makes the movie stand the test of time, aside from the wonderful performances include the expert direction of Franklin Shaffner, the unconventional score by Mr. Jerry Goldsmith, and the groundbreaking special effects (which still stand the test of time) by John Chambers.
Now to the DVD:  The film is presented in digitally remastered 5.1 audio in 2:35:1 anamorphic widescreen and looks rather good.  I didn't perceive any color issues or transfer issues the first time I watched it, which is always nice to see.  As for the commentaries on the first disk, they are rather useless as commentaries go.  Roddy McDowall passed away before this set was released so I assume that his parts of the commentary are recorded from earlier interviews.  As for the rest of the voices on that commentary, their insights are few and far between.  In essence the track serves more as a 2.0 audio track for the film than a true-blue commentary.
Then there is the ""live"" (thankfully) music commentary track by Jerry Goldsmith.  It gives some insight into the musical choices as well as instrument selections by the acclaimed composer, as well as other small bits of information.  On the whole, it's nothing overly amazing.  Thankfully, Goldsmiths music speaks for itself.
Finally, there's the text-only commentary by Eric Greene, Author of ""Planet of the Apes as American Myth"".  It's not bad if you're into text commentaries.  But at points, it just becomes a nuisance.  It makes you wonder why they couldn't have just added another voice commentary that might have actually been worth listening to.
Then we come to disk two...which is chocked full of goodies.  The two hour featurette ""Behind the Planet of the Apes"" - Hosted by the late Roddy McDowall, is a great view into the history of this film and its four lesser sequels.  Then there are some also smaller featurettes, including the 1968 original making of.  Also included are dailies and outtakes from the original 1968 stock footage (with no audio track) and some of Roddy McDowall's home films shot on 16mm (at least that what I guessed from the camera he was using...it might have been 8mm).  Again, these have no audio, but have been filled in with some of the music from the movie.  The problem here is that ""Behind the Planet of the Apes"" has some of this same footage in it, so you're basically seeing the same thing twice.
So, is it worth it to buy this 35th anniversary dvd?  By all means yes.  This film is a classic by all rights, and it's worth being a part of everyone's DVD collection.  And while the commentaries are on the weak side, there's enough here to keep the general DVD enthusiast happy.  It really is true what they say...they just don't make films (sci-fi or not) like this anymore.

1944018,5,B0000TPA4C,"Perhaps the single greatest tribute to this film is that Tim Burton paid homage to it with a remake that was good but failed to capture the impact of the original.  It is hard to identify exactly why this film seized the imagination of several generations especially since in many ways ""Planet of the Apes"" was a commentary on the sixties.  I saw it and learned, as I drove away from the theater, that Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. had just been shot.  The poignant coincidence of events will never be forgotten.  This is one of the great science fiction films with a remarkable script by the dean of fantasy writers Rod Serling.  It is well acted, even behind the make-up.  It has one of Jerry Goldsmith's best and most original scores.  And it still holds up quite well, largely because it was not driven by special effects.  The new edition does not offer much beyond the widescreen version of the DVD, but the extras are terrific and make this a worthy purchase. Charlton Heston gave one of his best perfomances and will always be remembered for two scenes...when he regains his ability to speak (you know the line), and of course the end scene that still works and may well prove to be a testament to humankind in the modern age.",1076976000,,1233,4.5225225225225225
1944019,5,B0000TPA4C,"At last a 1960s Science Fiction classic, the ORIGINAL Planet of The Apes gets it's deluxe treatment. However, I question why Eric Greene's ( Author of Planet of the Apes as American Myth, 1996, McFarland and Company ) commentary is in text form? The
audio commentaries with Roddy McDowall, Kim Hunter, Natalie
Trundy and John Chambers appear to have come from interviews or something. Composer Jerry Goldsmith's audio commentary was interesting. I suppose that for people who could not afford the six disc Planet of the Apes: The Evolution, the two hour documentary, Behind The Planet of the Apes is perhaps a welcoming sight. Hopefully Fox will continue to re-present the
rest of the Apes series in deluxe form such as this. Note: I went through six of these sets, due to what the seller informed me was a bad batch, whereas the picture freezes and jumps back to a previous chapter, or won't play period. Finally I had to
reluctantly settle for a full screen version, in which playback was perfect. Enjoy.",1076371200,4,1006,4.820809248554913

  Astronaut George Taylor (Charlton Heston) is making an audio report. He has been in deep space for six months from lifting-off at Cape Kennedy on July 14, 1972. It has been traveling at almost the speed of light. The counter reading says they are now in March 2673 and Taylor has not aged at all, but six months. Taylor now sleeps in a hibernation capsule. The space craft lands on an unnamed planet in a lake. The capsules now open for the men to awake. Only 3 astronauts have survived, Taylor, John Landon (Robert Gunner) and Dodge (Jeff Burton). Water is rushing into the space craft. They must get out. The counter reads October 25, 3978. . The men escape on a yellow water raft while the space craft is sinking into the lake. They now have to stay on this planet. They make it to land and have only 2 to 3 days of food and water in their survival kit. They have only 72 hours to find survival. This planet does not have a moon.  They do find plant life. They find objects on a cliff that could be scarecrows. Hearing water, they find a waterfall and the three men go swimming naked in the pond, but then someone steals their clothes. The men finds humans dressed in loincloth and old fur. These humans can not talk. A load roar comes from the trees. The humans run. The horses rush into the cornfields.  Riding on the horses are Apes dressed in leather coats and pants. The Apes shoot rifles at the humans. They are on the Planet of the Apes.  The Apes can talk as well as a humans back on Earth. Here, the humans are treated like animals.
