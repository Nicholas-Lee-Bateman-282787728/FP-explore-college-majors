Billed as ""light comedy"" it's so light there is literally NO comedy. If you think that's overstatement just buy it and you'll see this is trash.
Unfunny, and uninspired beyond the original pretense this hairball was made by a nobody director who got an Italian film grant and went on to spend his million on renting ""loaded minivans"" and banquets for the crew but little else. Utter drivel and shot in a dying upstate NY rust belt town that survives on government grants and pipedreams, Utica, NY ""Corruption Sin City"". This was crudely shot in miniHD, so luckily you can't see how bad the acting is.
The plot literally has gaping holes and utterly ridiculous, contrived ""coincidences"" that are good in Saturday morning cartoons and teenage fare but it's so contrived and forced it's embarrassing to sit thru.

Avoid this unless you like contrived drivel.",1480291200,,1086,4.746031746031746
8101762,4,B000CSEH7M,"Someone loaned this to me, and to be honest, I was skeptical. I stuck it next to the TV and forgot about it for a while. Finally, I got to feeling guilty about having it so long and watched it, so I could give it back.

What a very pleasant surprise! The people in the movie are ""real"" and the plot is fun and inventive. I don't watch many movies more than once, but I've watched this several times.",1249171200,,399,4.050632911392405
8101763,4,B000CSEH7M,"This was an unexpectedly fun movie to watch.  It really captures the experience of being an Italian-American living in Upstate NY.  Mariangela Melato was fantastic - still looks as good as when she did the movie ""So Fine"" with Ryan O'Neil and Goldie Hawn!  This is a must see if you can get your hands on a copy!",1174089600,,312,4.344827586206897
