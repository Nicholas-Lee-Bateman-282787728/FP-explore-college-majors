8619866,2,B004PJM0DC,"I've loved some of the Wild Party Girls DVDs, but I'm very disappointed with their WINTERFEST UNCENSORED one. On a few other Wild Party Girls DVDs, the editors sometimes mess with the picture, but on WINTERFEST UNCENSORED it's totally out of control!! I mean stuff like discoloration, switching from one picture aspect to another like widescreen to full screen, out-of-focus shots, jerky image, rapidly repeating shots that don't deserve to be, and on and on. Does ANYONE like to watch this stuff??! Making things worse for me is an annoying rap soundtrack that's often going in the background.
