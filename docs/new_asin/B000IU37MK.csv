2663334,1,B000IU37MK,"This movie starts out so, so and then nothing happens except delusions on the part of Danika (Marisa T.) Some reviewers say the ending was an excellent surprise...I must be really dense because I didn't get it.  Sorry I bought the DVD.",1320278400,,235,4.595238095238095
2663335,1,B000IU37MK,"First let me say that I'm a big fan of Marisa Tomei, since Mona Lisa Vito captured my heart, as well as a fan of horror & thrillers. This was the reason for my purchase of this DVD, goaded by the 4 stars, and positive reviews of my fellow Amazonians. That is why I say, shame on you!

I watched the film for about 35 minutes, patiently - bloody painfully - waiting for something to happen. Anything to happen. Nothing but disjointed and disconnected scenes washed over the screen, one after the other, yet there was never a story developing.

Studies on film of the defragmenting of a character's mind abound, but you have to draw the audience in at some point and give the story direction, even in the randomness of seeming insanity. Its failure to pull the pieces together, as well as the unappealing promise to continue to fail until the conclusion, is why I turned it off, and why, I think, I've never heard of this film.

Avoid it like the plague. Marisa Tomei usually takes over any scene she is in by force of will, but here, she is oddly out of place. I think they got her on board because no one else of note would allow the strike mark on their career.",1318723200,,1162,4.321100917431193
2663336,5,B000IU37MK,"DANIKA is a mere 80 minute film I watched a few hours ago and the impact it had on me was immense. Marisa Tomei was simply outstanding in this roll and obviously very believable since I still can't shake the film from my head. I was easily drawn into the plot right from the beginning and it mesmerized me until the very end. I never left my chair! It's been many, many years since a film held my full attention and it amazes me that I never heard of it before. But then it's obviously not a mega-dollar production and it seems like that's the only films we ever hear about these days. I HIGHLY recommend this film and since I watched it on Encore, I'll now have to purchase it to add to my movie library. As a side note, I hear so many people complain that some of their favorite movies are not on DVD. Unfortunately, each time movie formats change, (beta, VHS, DVD, Blu-Ray) we lose a few more outstanding films. But thanks to the premium channels of Encore, I am still able to see those wonderful, forgotten films.",1254009600,,1017,4.302083333333333
2663357,4,B000IU37MK,"I don't want to spoil the ending. Apparently it's a shocking surprise you didn't see coming that explains all the events leading up to it.

It's about a mother/wife who has a serious problem- she thinks all the worse things that can possibly happen to her family actually ARE happening, even though they're not. Well then again, maybe they *are*. Who knows?

The storyline jumps around from one horrible event to the other. In one scene, she goes to put her groceries in the refrigerator, only to pull someones HEAD out of the grocery bag, haha. This prompts her to grab her kids, run outside, and scream there's been a murder. When the police arrive, they look through the house and come to the conclusion there's no murder and the woman is crazy. But this is where things get totally confusing- maybe this murder really did happen and the carefully created storyline made it seem like it didn't.

The movie is basically a constant flow of unusual and confusing twists and turns that make you wonder more about what's going on than actually trying to figure out this complex mess. You just never know what's real and what's not.

There were other shocking moments near the end that involve her husband and her oldest sons girlfriend. Apparently the girlfriend was the housekeeper all along. Or maybe she made up the housekeeper part.  I mean, maybe the mother/wife made up that part.  Maybe the whole scene with her oldest sons girlfriend jumping in bed with the mother/wife was made up too.

No wait, I get it- the entire time the mother/wife was actually killed during that bank robbery in the beginning of the movie!  She never really had a family the whole time- she just made up having three kids and a husband because it was during the bank robbery she questioned whether she made the right decision going through life not even bothering starting a family.  Yes, and the oldest sons girlfriend, the school teacher, the police, these were just people that flashed through her mind in a moment of total confusion.  Yes, this is it!  Sarcasm of course.

Hey, that's just one of possibly 1,000 ways to interpret this movie.  Anyway, back to the movie review...

Throughout the movie, the mother/wife/psychopath kept imagining what it would be like to see her children much older, and what they would be like as teenagers. Of course it meant as teenagers -since the mother/wife had severe mental problems- each of her children would all go through their own distinct severe problems which would end up driving the mother/wife crazy.

Honestly, there wasn't much of anything that made a bit of sense to me. The only thing I gathered is that the mother/wife was so screwed up in the head that absolutely *nothing* could save her. If this movie was designed to confuse the viewers, or make people question what's real in the world and what's just an illusion, congratulations- it succeeded.",1249516800,,2889,4.761523046092185
2663358,5,B000IU37MK,"Very well done with a surprise ending that I never suspected, which explains everything. A haunting movie that will come back to you again and again, and make you much more sympathetic to the plight of the mentally ill.  I probably will see it again.  Marisa Tomei, as usual, was perfect.",1245024000,,288,4.627450980392157
2663359,4,B000IU37MK,"I don't know if this movie has a ""correct"" interpretation of what happened.  I think it is more to get people talking.  I saw it this weekend and I'm still trying to figure out what really happened.  It definitely sticks with you long after you've viewed it.  Sometimes I thought it was just a dream, other times I thought it really happened and she was just flashing back in a confused state of mind, and then other times I think it was her sitting on a bench thinking of different scenarios of how the whole thing could have taken place.  If it was real, then was the accident at the end intentional.... did she kill her husband.... what was up with the severed head vision ..... who was the lost child.....what was up with the swimming pool/dead dog segment?  So many questions come out of this movie.  Really a movie you want to watch at least twice and to discuss with someone else.",1244419200,,887,4.404907975460123
2663360,4,B000IU37MK,"Not a horror film (although it has some elements thereof) and yes it's confusing because it's designed for a thinking audience (rare among film these days). The entire span of the movie in realtime is the last five minutes. Everything that comes before that is a mixed up amalgum of flashbacks, paranoid delusions, wishful flash forwards, psychotic interludes, etc. It is meant to be a jumble. Sorting out what life was, what life wasn't and what life could have been. It is like a jigsaw puzzle where some pieces fit, some are missing and others do not belong. I could expand on these themes but do not want to give away the ending - which is actually quite brilliant. I have always wondered how certain people come to be in the places they are in their lives (what's their back story - what went right - what went wrong). Marisa Tomei is always captivating and nails this part. People coming for simple thrills and hold you by the hand story telling should avoid this film. Those interested in exploring darker sides of the human condition are welcome. If you like films like ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""The Sixth Sense"", then this is right up your alley. Highly Recommended.",1234310400,,1171,4.661835748792271
2663361,2,B000IU37MK,"The storyline had a lot of potential, but the script and acting left something to be desired.  Not much of a grabber and it was kind of slow.  The ending wasn't as good as it could have been - almost like, a little suspense - then flop, there it is.",1221177600,,249,3.96
2663362,3,B000IU37MK,"DANIKA is not really a horror movie, but a psychological tale focusing on Danika (Marisa Tomei), a young mother who is vastly over protective of her three children.  Her husband (Craig Bierko) had an affair with their nanny, but now all seems right for the family..until Danika starts having horrifying visions of terrible events that may or may not be real.  DANIKA is a complex tale centering on the fear we have that something may happen to those we love.  Tomei is effective, as is Bierko and Regina Hall as the kindly therapist.  A bit contrived at the end, but not a bad film.",1192752000,,582,4.5673076923076925
2663363,4,B000IU37MK,"I was in blockbuster after not being in one for a while, and lo behold what did I see...a current movie starring Marisa Tomei?  She is still doing movies huh.  I've been a fan of hers since I was little, ever since I first saw her in ""A Different World"", without knowing why.  Now I know, it's because I've had good taste, duh!  She is the most underused and underrated actress I can think of (while writing this review, that is) and wish she would star in more movies.  I said STAR, not ""appear"".  I also like phycological and mental thrillers (fight club, momento).  Although Danika is NOT in the same league as those two, due to the ending, Tomei makes watching it all the worthwhile.  I had to watch it over, because at first I didn't 'get it' .. the ending.  It turns out, yep, i 'got it' alright, I was set too high on my expectations.  Then I read other reviews and saw it is not just in my head, that this movie ""commits cinematical treason"" someone said -- by tensing you up, preparing you for an awesome ending, and then .... blah, unsatisfactory conclusion (but makes sense).  Enjoy the ride but don't expect a grand ending.  Oh yeah, and of course enjoy the treat of seeing a movie that actually stars Marisa Tomei.",1187568000,,1227,4.380530973451328
2663364,5,B000IU37MK,"Marisa Tomei has always been one of my favorite actresses.  With that pretty face, gorgeous red hair, and animated spirit, she should be one of America's biggest stars.  She's won an Oscar, for goodness' sake, so no one can doubt her acting abilities.  Why, then, does it seem like such a rare treat to actually see her play the central role in a film?  The woman is fabulous in Danika.  Say what you like about the story (it's one of those psychological thrillers, so audience reaction will inevitably be somewhat divided), but Marisa Tomei turns in a gripping, very believable performance.

Every parent (well, every good parent, anyway) wants desperately to protect his/her family, especially the children, so in this respect Danika (Tomei) is basically no different than the vast majority of wives and mothers in the world.  All of a sudden, though, her life has taken a turn toward the surreal.  She begins having awful visions which lead her to seek psychiatric help after what can only be described as a psychotic episode at work.  Not only does she see awful things happening to her husband and kids, she also has psychic-like visions of other kids dying in horrible ways, and these things come about in such a way that she feels as if she could have saved them.  This leads her to become ever more obsessive in terms of protecting her own family, and we all know how teens and pre-teens react to overprotective mothers.  A lesser actress couldn't have played this role effectively, as the story is surreal and sometimes confusing as the tension builds toward a pretty powerful conclusion.

As with all psychological thrillers, the proof of the pudding is ultimately in the ending.  It is possible to figure out, to some degree, what is really going on here - I picked up on it from the preview alone, although I didn't predict the final machination of the emotional climax - but I don't think it matters much whether you figure things out on your own or not.  The emotional power of the final minutes is not to be denied, and the whole movie leaves you with plenty of food for thought.  It's the kind of ending that viewers will want to discuss with one another after the fact, and I think that is a sign of the story's ultimate effectiveness.  Any movie in this genre is going to draw one-star reviews from those who claim not to get it, but I think the majority of viewers will find this movie spellbinding and emotionally jarring.",1180742400,,2442,4.6573426573426575
2663365,4,B000IU37MK,"I picked this movie up wandering around the video store and it looked kind of interesting so I gave it a try.  I have to say that I am happy I did.  This was a nice diverting hour and a half, although I did figure out the twist ending just before it came.  Marisa Tomei was just wonderful in this film as the mom.  The movie reminded me a bit of Sixth Sense and later of Jacob's ladder, with elements of both.  I was watching this with a sweetie and the film got a real scream out of her while Marisa was putting groceries away.  I was told I should have warned her what was coming.  Heck, I didn't know.  The bottom line here is that this is a pretty good film, has suspense, some gore, and some mystery.  Pretty sad though.  It might take a while to get over this one.  Talk it over with someone you love though.  That will help  ease the pain.  Glad to recommend this one.",1179187200,,875,4.04093567251462
2663366,1,B000IU37MK,"This was a terrible movie.  It started off with a feeling of suspense that never had a break.  The sound/music designer should have been held back - this movie would have been better had some scenes not been underscored at all.  We got bored with the constant Danika episodes that never moved the story along.  Various potential plot elements (a missing girl, a schoolteacher) were introduced but turned out to have no relevance to the eventual end of the movie.  I recommend Jacob's Ladder instead.",1177286400,,499,4.823529411764706
2663370,1,B000IU37MK,This is the worst movie I have seen all year. It was hard to follow what was happening - you couldn't tell what was real or not. The movie made no sense. Total waste of time to watch - it will leave you total confused in the end. Nothing was real.,1175817600,,247,3.8627450980392157
2663371,3,B000IU37MK,"Always trust your gut feeling - 7th sense (90 minutes)

RATING: 3.25 stars (plot was kind of confusing ... and end was very abrupt)

I rented this movie from the local family-run DVD rental, because the plot described on the jacket intrigued me.  It deals with the topic of the paranormal and with the psychology of paranoia, and had an element of suspense (it's been a while since I watched anything close to a ""scary movie"").

Danika is the name of the main character, and she is a wife of three kids (between 8 and 14), a good wife, and also a banker.  The movie starts out with her normal family and work life, but soon the viewer is introduced to the weird premonitions, the visions, and paranoid/fear-filled feelings Danika experiences.  The movie turns out to show how these feelings, these gut-feelings can be truly a gift or a plague in Danika's life and the lives of those in her life.

The fine line between a dream/daydream and reality is inter-sliced by the director in a very cunning way (kudos).  It's a scary thing to have visions, but this movie shows that it's more scary to have those visions come true.  Danika's 7th sense (6th being intuition) of paranoia/fear is something she cannot escape, and has to learn to deal with before she becomes enmeshed by it.

The moral of this story, for me, is:
always trust your gut instinct, but remember that there is a fine line between paranoia and the fear of an event happening .... Also everyone of us has to define that line for him/herself.  For Monika, it looks as if her fears have sabotaged her life, because she ""cannot protect everyone in her life.""",1173312000,,1619,4.567474048442906
2663372,5,B000IU37MK,"This movie had such a twist at the end that I had to rewind and view it again! Marisa Tomei plays an anxious mother who tries desperately to protect her children from all the terrible things in the world. She visualizes tragedies so real that she begins to think she's losing her mind. Are the vivid images her imagination, real, or a sad version of 'hell on earth' where she's forced to relive her worst nightmare; losing her family.

2663373,5,B000IU37MK,This movie is a very effective thriller. I knew that something was wrong with the character but I never expected that ending. Marisa Tomei is excellent as the worried mother. I wish she would be in more movies. The only disappointing part of the movie is tnat it has too much color and light for a thriller. Its colors should be cooler (blues and grays) and not warm as they are. Dont miss it.,1168646400,,393,4.324324324324325
2663374,5,B000IU37MK,"I rented this film out of curiosity because the movie ""Night Listener"" was rented out so I picked this one up instead. Man, what an ending! Tomei gives her best performance yet, and this film moves along quickly and AVOIDS CLICHES like in all the other films (Grudge, Ring, etc.) where there are scary little kids who see dead people. None of that nonsense here. This is better. IMAGINE ""One Hour Photo"" with a touch of M. Night Shayamalan mixed in. Not gruesome bloddy horror, but definately some moments that will make you cringe - this film is so realistic that it is TRULY DEEPLY SCARY. This is my movie thriller surprise of the year. If you like this one also check out ""November"" starring Cortney Cox, or ""11:14"" starring Rachael Leigh Cook. ""Danika"" is so good that I have been telling people about it every chance I get. RENT IT, BUY IT, DOWNLOAD IT, whatever. Just watch it!!!! NOW!!!!",1168473600,,894,4.59375

2663377,4,B000IU37MK,"Relatively new cinematic team of director Ariel Vromen and writer Joshua Leibner pounce onto the scene with a surprisingly fine little film that has basically gone unnoticed.  DANIKA is a story that demands the viewer's careful attention and rewards that attention with a finely wrought surprise ending.  This is a tough movie to review: almost anything that is said about it diminishes the impact of a fresh look.

Danika (the superb and grossly underused actress Marisa Tomei) is a beautiful, well-dressed successful professional woman, loved by her husband Randy (Craig Bierko) and her children Kurt (Kyle Gallner), Lauren (Nicki Prian) and Brian (Ridge Canipe).  Yet even from the opening scenes we can tell something is amiss: Danika 'sees' disturbing things, terrifying events and people that alter her attention to her job and her family. She visits  a young psychiatrist Evelyn (Regina Hall) who becomes her confidant - the only person who accepts that Danika is witnessing disturbing sights.  A mixture of critical pieces of disastrous events flash before Danika's eyes as well as flashbacks to some years back when her children were young.  Danika overcompensates for her fears by being an overprotective mother, an unfortunate trait that begins to fracture her family.

The pace of the film changes to rapid fire events as the reasons for Danika's  visions become clear: we finally see just what made this brilliant and strong woman the victim of a terrified and disturbed psyche and the manner in which each of the characters in the story impacts this discovery is well-illuminated.  The surprise ending scene is a stunner and one that will haunt the viewer.

Marisa Tomei makes this very difficult, well-written role completely believable.  She is an actress of enormous gifts.  Likewise the remainder of the cast offers such fine ensemble work that credit must be given director  Ariel Vromen for being a young talent on the rise.  Yes, there are some portions of the film that beg credibility but then that is what delusional thinking is about. This is a tight little film that deserves attention.

Then you'll understand the layering process of this unique story seen before. Danika is about a young mother whose hallucinations and reality intermingle together in a strange story of a life gone wrong. A great family and nice life slowly deteriorates as experiences get stranger and stranger. The perfect life starts digressing with each flask of knowledge until the audience is left with nothing. In the end, everything comes together in a powerful tale of woe. Close to the end of the end of the film you are almost guessing what actually happened, but it does surprise, especially if you've not seen this particular lore. Tomei does a wonderful job and it is a wonder that she is not in more mainstream films, she's fantastic as Danika. The rest of the cast does a nice job during the film with many familiar beautiful faces. This is an A class film with few purposefully placed liberties in direction and a typical story told in a very atypical way.
