7928361,3,B00004ZB6Y,"This video is (almost) all about the US Women's softball team from the Olympics in 2000 tooting their horn about their Gold Medal. Truth is, they came back from a deficit, and I'll give them this toot, as they deserve it.
But it still drips with ""we are the greatest"" throughout the video. There's only so much if this I can take.
But having said that, what I *liked* about the video is watching Lisa Fernandez pitch. I pitch softball, too, and I truly look to her performance as an inspiration, especially her mental toughness (as mentioned in the video).
It was worth the money I spent for it, but I do not show it to my kids team, nor even the girls, as it is just not entertaining enough.",1042070400,2,692,4.3307692307692305
