I can't remember ever watching anything so very bad before. Why anyone would waste money to distribute this mess is way beyond my understanding.  A ""Vanity"" release?

The Good: Best packaging I think I have ever seen.  Very High Quality double DVD case, Great artwork.

The OK: The girls were cute, funny, and bare!  The music CD was fair and a nice bonus.

The Bad: Too loud, too hard to follow, too many closeups of ugly actors, contrived humorless humor, dialog disaster, actors who liked to listen to themselves saying nothing with foreign accents.

The Results: The Movie went into the trash, music CD went into the car CD player for another chance, and I wrote this review to keep others from wasting their time and money!",1415836800,,755,4.62406015037594

8051476,5,B0007TKGDA,I don't get the negative reviews on this movie at all. This is a backyard mock-documentary about the perils of no budget movie making and it's a fun one at that! Well acted and funny as hell with beautiful naked girls to boot. What more can you ask for it a low budget movie about making a low budget movie?,1312502400,,307,4.133333333333334
8051477,1,B0007TKGDA,"I found this in a bargain bin at Wal-Mart, here in Canada, selling for $[...], and figured that for that price, I couldn't go wrong.

WRONG!!!

Oh my God, I was stunned by the actual fact that anyone was able to get this movie (and boy do I use the term, ""Movie"", loosely) packaged into such an appealing looking DVD package.

Words can not truly describe this utterly inane piece of crap.

Even the usage of the word, ""Amateurish"", would be considered a blight, on the amateur film making community.

I personally only managed a few minutes of this trite, before I felt my brains leaking out of my skull and into my socks, in an attempt at self preservation.

And trust me, this isn't a case of, ""so bad it's good"", or, ""cult cinema"", it's just plain, ""BAD"".

If I were to give two, two year olds, a camcorder, I can guarantee, that the resulting footage would have more substance and enjoyability then this film (and that's putting it mildly, to say the least).

As for the purported nudity, well, from what I saw, you'd be better off spending $7.00 for a drink at your local strip club, then to waste your money on this.

In short, even if you consider yourself a lover of bad cinema, this film is definitely not one to add to your collection (in fact, adding this to your collection of bad movies could possibly lower the value of said collection).

Try to learn from my stupidity.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have to try and scoop the memory of this film, out of my brain, using a large, rusty, grapefruit spoon, and a broken, pickle fork.

Wish me luck.",1213574400,3,1559,4.393728222996516
8051478,1,B0007TKGDA,"I was seduced by positive reviews into buying this inept piece of contrivance. Don't be fooled. The naked girls are o.k but nothing better than you might expect to find at some amatuer strip night, they have very little screen time.

 Oh dear I hate this train wreak dreck, no horror no style, probably the most boring collection of random jump-cut nothingness I have ever seen !

Worse still the men who appear in this belive they are being humourous, if only they were. The last laugh is their's if you get suckered into parting with your hard earned green.

I love low / no budget expliotation movies, I have a collection of many hundreds, never ever have I seen anything as poor as this.

As a far better alternative I recommend H.G Lewis's superior ""Blood Feast 2"" unrated edition",1120867200,5,785,4.578571428571428
8051479,4,B0007TKGDA,"ACTRESS APOCALYPSE begins with a dedication ""to all

those who've tried to make an epic film in their

backyard."" It's an exploitation mockumentary about the

production nightmares of David B. Lincoln (Garo

Nigoghossian) and his brother Vance (Greg Freeman) as

they shoot their ever-morphing ""mullet-headed killer

Indian/flesh-eating gay zombie"" flick.  Things quickly

go awry when an uppity ""professional actress"" (Dahlia

Legault) makes quite a scene of her own, bawling out

and humiliating the brothers after enduring an

agonizing day of shooting.  She storms off the set leaving the already unstable Vance hungry for revenge.  He takes over production, auditioning actresses in ways that Russ Meyer never dared to dream of, and the homemade epic turns into a snuff flick when Vance gets his mitts around each new aspiring, nekkid young starlet..  The first extended strangulation scene had this reviewer squirming in his seat!  Really demented, disturbing stuff even though the preceding 40 minutes were hilarious!  I feel like I've given away too much of the plot, but I haven't even mentioned the antics of the ""Golden Terror"" yet!

Who knows what inspired ACTRESS APOCALYPSE's ""real"" director Richard R. Anasky's (who plays the mild-mannered cameraman Fernando in the film) psycho/psychedelic imagery, but it's quite a feast for the eyes and ears.  Metal band Space Probe Taurus provides the appropriate music to accompany the visuals. (and the soundtrack CD is included in the unrated double-disc set!) Anasky seems to have a pretty firm grip on who his target audience will be; people tired of the same old thing, looking for a movie with an edge that sends political correctness and Hollywood conventions to the landfill where they belong.  So a word of warning to those of you on the fence:  this is not a movie to take home to Mother!  It's about as bold, misogynistic (to you wimpy PC-types), garish (in a fun way!) and outrageous a movie you'll likely find at Amazon.com!

The DVD has plenty of bonus features but curiously, no commentary.  The feature itself has a fun gimmick that I discovered upon second viewing however:  there are numerous subliminal easter egg freeze frames scattered throughout the film that speak to the viewer.  Little messages that I'll let you find for yourselves.  Besides, I doubt Amazon would let me reproduce my favorites without censoring the content.  Speaking of censors, there's a certain scene in the film that is digitally pixelled over, but you'll get a good look at what the fuss was about in the outtakes supplement.

Overall, a very impressive debut film!  Highly recommended for those of us who're ready for movies that take the gloves off and give their best shot!!!",1112918400,4,2730,5.099322799097066
