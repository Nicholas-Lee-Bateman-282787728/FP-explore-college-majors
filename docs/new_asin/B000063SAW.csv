Good for starters I guess.",1037318400,,162,3.7941176470588234
8362761,4,B000063SAW,"This video is quite expensive, but it's worth the price to learn Lightwave 7 or 7.5 quickly. I also bought Lightwave 7 by Dan Ablan, but his book is over 1000 pages long. That book is good, detailed, but too long for me to be motivated to read it. If you want to learn about how to use the icons and menus on Lightwave, then this video will help you to create basic objects. The chapters consist of: interface, polygons, primitives, modifiers, multipliers, and tools. The author goes into detail on how to zoom in and out, rotate, center the object, and do other things. The video quality is not very good. It's quite poor and it's hard to see the toolbars on the left side of the screen when the camera is filming the entire computer screen. However, when the host zooms in to show specific parts of a model or zooms in to show the steps, then the quality improves a little. You can still see it, but don't expect top quality pictures like a dvd movie. This dvd really helps me, and so I might get the other ones too (model 2, surface 1 & 2, and others). Because now I know how to do basic modeling, it motivates me to read Dan Ablan's book to get more detailed information.",1036195200,,1175,4.273542600896861

8362763,3,B000063SAW,"This is video is okay but not too deep tutorial about how use lightwave partlce f/x. Also, lightwave guy is speaking very fast and jump too much about step to step plus there is no closed caption. It is allright show on video tutorial. that is my opinion.",1020297600,,255,4.333333333333333
