3692291,5,B001M564BQ,"Most documentaries fail when they can't stay objective; not true with Dear Zachary.

When a friend is murdered, a filmmaker decides to make a tribute to his life. But that's only the beginning in this story of how many lifes we touch.  It's best not seen without knowing too much of the story, and you will find yourself trying to find others who've seen it to talk about.

It's like sitting down for a chat with a stranger, and the conversation turns to a personal story so moving it feels like you're experiencing it, and suddenly it's a part of you. Your family becomes bigger as your heart breaks.  The world becomes a much bigger place, and you feel connected to everything, and feel the loss of what's missing.

It's best if you don't learn more about the story before seeing it. Kuenne documentary is a tribute, a work of art, and a call to action.

Update:  If you connect with this story in any way, David Bagby wrote a book called Dance With the Devil: A Memoir of Murder and Loss. And do look up the story to find out just how powerful Kuenne's film is; it was a catalyst for change.",1228694400,12,1094,4.359605911330049
3692292,5,B001M564BQ,"It's difficult to write about this movie without giving too much away, but it is a story about incredible human spirit and the ability to press on in the face of unspeakable evil and an unbeleivable legal process that seems to be more interested in protecting the guilty than the innocent.

The hard work and dedication that comes out in this film shows that Zachary and his father are very deeply loved. THIS is a true documentary, and a real must see.",1228608000,6,453,4.524390243902439

3692294,4,B001M564BQ,"I watched this movie before it was on Amazon Prime to watch.  It was a heart moving film about a man and his struggles before dying.  Personally, I think family would love this film and cherish it.  As to why it was released, I am not sure.  I think this film would be very impacting and the most beautiful gift possible if you knew him but as an outsider, I felt like I was emotionally exhausted over someone I didn't know and frustrated with not being able to hug his son.",1521417600,,474,4.175824175824176

An incredible story filmed by an incredible friend about a group of incredible people.  The strength, resilience, and sheer will for love of having to endure what the parents had to go through....again just WOW.  Everyone should watch this tribute and story.  INCREDIBLE!!!!!!",1516924800,9,430,5.057142857142857
3692301,5,B001M564BQ,Tragic and chilling.  I have to agree - NOT knowing much about this film is the key to having the full impact.  Was left feeling great respect and awe for the Bagby's.  Andrew certainly had lovely friends who would have loved Zachary his whole life if they had the chance.,1516579200,,272,4.4
3692302,5,B001M564BQ,"It is unbelievable that such evil can exist, but it is also incredibly important that we come to accept that as reality. This movie is an incredibly important wake up call, to the incredible selfishness that has roots in this world, and destroys the kindest of us. so please watch this.",1516320000,,286,4.627450980392157
3692303,5,B001M564BQ,"This is a documentary that will break you emotionally. I cannot describe how hard I cried watching this. While some of the editing choices were out of place, it does not take away from the impact of what you're watching. This is a must see, but not one you'd want to watch multiple times. It will leave you shaken, sad, angry and you'll want to call everyone you know after it's done. The proceeds made from this film go to a great cause that I implore you to support. This is a very important movie to watch. And it's not all sad; there are very funny and charming moments and great footage that'll immediately make you feel close to the subject of the film. It's a shocking emotional rollercoaster of a documentary that deserves to be watched at least once. One time is all you need.",1514505600,,785,4.383561643835616

3692315,2,B001M564BQ,"I just watched ""Dear Zachary"" for a second time last night.  The first time (about a year ago), I was very much pulled into the story and the overall presentation.  Being a fan of documentaries though, even then I was a bit confused as to why people considered it to be the best documentary ever, and were ""wrecked"" by it when there are so many tragic, emotionally disturbing docs out there.  Was this an horrific story?  Most definitely.  Have I seen documentaries about equally (or even more) horrific situations?  Yes I most definitely have.  I wondered if the ""gotcha"" aspect of the twist towards the end (I'm trying not to spoil it...) made people feel more viscerally connected to the story and therefore increased the reaction to it?  Not sure...

When I watched it again last night,  because I knew where the story was going and wasn't so wrapped up in the tension and mystery, I was really put off by the filmaker's choices in how he presented the material.  So many aspects seemed heavy-handed, repetitive, and manipulative.  From the seemingly endless, rather dull videos of Andrew backed by schmaltzy music (I get that these videos are precious for Andrew's family and friends but after a while they felt tedious for me after I got the point that he was a good guy who was loved and well-regarded), to the ""puppet mouth"" effect when we were to be disgraced at individuals in the justice system, to the rapid-fire narration of certain parts of the story that could have been slowed down and expanded upon instead of forcing us to quickly digest chunks of details as though they were running out of time, to the SCREAMING rage-filled effect when the twist is revealed -- it all seemed amateurish and so lacking in any nuance that I was a bit embarrassed for the filmmaker.  Of course, knowing that he was good friends with Andrew explains pretty much all of this and sadly, his own pain and grief shows in the material in a way I think does it a disservice.  This isn't a doc that needed to give equal time and attention to Shirley Turner's story, but having some distance from the subject could have allowed the final product to feel less like a friend venting their misery at you.  I had so many questions that I feel like a filmmaker divorced from the source material might have tried to address.",1505174400,,2309,4.611246943765281
3692316,5,B001M564BQ,"This was such a sad story. It resonated with me because I think I'm watching the same thing unfold in slow motion with a family member. Unfortunately, the current system in the US (state by state) allows for the same events as this story, with no signs of change. I bought the dvd because I feel a connection to the family involved, and I guess to show others in the hopes that things might change for the better if they see how flawed current protections are.",1500508800,,460,4.3604651162790695

3692318,2,B001M564BQ,This documentary was more like an amateur student film. It could have been done much better but it made its point I suppose.,1494892800,,124,4.434782608695652
3692319,5,B001M564BQ,"I had to watch this video for a college criminal justice course on domestic and family violence. I started it, thinking it would be like any forensic files episode where they have a murder victim, they look at the evidence, find a suspect, and then case closed. This could not have been farther from the case. This documentary looks at the victim from the eyes' of his family and friends, not through a microscope. It shows how the system that is supposed to protect people like Andrew and his son, Zachary, can fail. It is stories like these that remind me why I want to be a police officer. They show me that the system can fail and it will be my job to protect them when it does fail.",1494115200,2,687,4.292307692307692
3692320,5,B001M564BQ,"This is by far the most emotionally devastating movie I have ever seen. Be prepared with some tissues. I did not know the story before I watched it, and I felt sick as the story unfolded. This is a terrible tragedy and the documentary is well made. I can't believe that people like Turner exist in this world. My heart goes out to the Bagbys.",1492819200,,342,4.276923076923077
3692321,3,B001M564BQ,"There is an important piece missing in these comments and reviews:  What was it about Andrew that got him caught up (and with his guard lowered!) with this woman?  He was a nice looking, stocky, by all accounts personable man, and yet ....  I think of Of Human Bondage. What did smiling, laughing, engaging Andrew think of himself?  It seems that this was the problem.  Yes, there are exploitative people who take advantage of others, but Andrew had to have had a diminished view of himself to have settled for, and defended, the relationship that led to his death.  Hey, people are flawed, sometime you have to look hard to find the flaw.  The documentary, as well done as it is, is not well-balanced in this regard:  It takes two to tango.  Why would he meet with her alone knowing she was pregnant and knowing he was ending the relationship?  This was a bad judgement.  People die from bad judgements.  I don't mean to downplay the role of Shirley, but only to highlight the missing piece.",1490054400,,992,4.573863636363637

3692325,5,B001M564BQ,"This is such a heart-wrenching story.  What happened to this family is incredibly painful, but also leaves one boiling mad at the Canadian authorities that made it possible for accused murderer Shirley Turner to be released back into society so that she could unleash her psychopathic anger against an innocent baby and kill again.  Shirley should be in hell as we speak and from there, there is no release.",1485388800,,407,4.884057971014493

There are very few films that two years from now I'll think about, but this one, I'll never forget, not even 20 years from now.

This story, and the people who lived it, caused sweeping changes to the Canadian justice system-too late for them, but they used their tragedy to help future crime victims.  If you think one person cannot have a huge influence in the world, meet Dr. Andrew Bagby by watching this film. Beautifully crafted by his best friend, you will be in tears fort most of the running time.  I watch this every few months because it is just that good.

This is a stunning tribute to the filmmakers friend, and a depiction of the meaning a life can have; the people who love them, miss them, and subsequently feel their absence very deeply. Ultimately, this film destroyed me- I think it's fair to give warning that it is not light-hearted and will probably crush you- but it's worth the emotional toll because it highlights the beautiful aspects of what it is to be human (brought out against the stark contrast of the ugly, evil side of humanity).

I have been trying to ""give up"" my habit of ""googling"" all the movies I watch, and I truly wish I had just given in and researched this movie while watching. Although I expected the movie to be sad, this was the most heartbreaking film I have seen, and to know that it was all true was devastating. I agree with the previous reviewer that said to prepare to cry and not be able to get off the couch for a couple hours. That said, this was a beautifully done tribute to a man whose life was cut far too short. It made me think about the type of impact I would like to leave and the love and dedication his friends had for him. This story would be emotionally difficult for anyone and even more so for a parent, I believe. I have never seen a movie that affected me so deeply, having a son just a bit older than Andrew's. I would highly recommend watching this movie and preparing yourself for the way it will make you feel. The many failures of the Canadian justice system in this case are shocking and appalling, and the strength and resolve of Andrew's parents is remarkable and beyond comprehension. Must watch!",1451952000,,1222,4.294372294372295

I gave it to a ""friend"", so that he could have the same uplifting experience I did.  If you hate people, this is a great movie to watch to make you hate them even more.  If you are feeling sorry for yourself, watch it and feel better.  Worth watching, just make sure you take your anti-depression meds regularly.",1451865600,16,483,4.322222222222222

3692383,5,B001M564BQ,"Ive seen a lot of documentaries that had me question things. The way kids were being taught in Jesus Camp, the police system in Memphis in the Paradise Lost series, the entire Catholic religion in Deliver Us From Evil, and many others had me scratching my head, wondering how any of this could be allowed. Dear Zachary is another one of those documentaries, this time showing us just how unimportant certain systems make the lives and well-being of children seem. While the title of this one makes it seem like a kind of video diary for a childs father, things take a drastic turn near the end that not only had me in tears, but also enraged.

The film is essentially done in three sections. For the first third, we learn about Andrew Bagby through interviews with dozens of people who knew him at various times in his life, and get to see a lot of clips of him at different ages. Being features in the directors own movies at a young age, serving as best man at multiple weddings, just joking around with peopleits clear that he was a very loved person and an all around great guy. Things took a turn for the worst when he broke up with his fianc and started seeing a much older woman, Shirley. His friends immediately noticed that there was something off about her. She was crude, jealous, and definitely not the kind of person any of them could ever see him with. After being together for some time, Andrew broke up with Shirley, only to have her travel thousands of miles back to his home where she killed him soon after. Some time passed, and she announced that she was pregnant with his son. She had the baby, Zachary, and what followed was an ugly legal battle between her and Andrews parents, David and Kathleen. The final third of the documentary cover something so atrocious that its hard to watch, and the suffering that everyone involved in Andrew and Zacharys lives had to go through because of that woman.

This is one of those times where I cant say a whole lot about the film. Whats presented here speaks for itself and is very raw. Many documentaries do their best to cover both sides of a story and be neutral. Here, its ver hard to do that when one of the key people involved in it is a murderer and is allowed to walk the streets with a baby while the whole court process takes its sweet time with date after date to just SET a date for things to get started. Its not just Shirleys fault here, but the governments. Theres really no way any person in their right mind can get behind her or the legal process after everything happens. Because of how terribly everything is handled, you get a lot of on-the-spot reactions and emotions from people, especially David Bagby. He does not hold back for a second, and its good that the director chose to keep everything in, letting us see how mad he was time and time again. If youve ever been bothered watching a documentary because the answers people give are so contained, you don't have to worry about that here.

Dear Zachary is definitely now on my list of documentaries I recommend people watch. At the same time, I strongly advise new parents or any couples who are having trouble becoming parents to not watch this one until some time has gone by, or things get better. The only things I have against it is that some sequences are edited in an annoying way, with people talking over one another for dramatic effect. But I completely forgave that 2/3 in when a few photos of Kathleen and Zachary are shown in silence.

Just typing that last sentence got me choked up.",1444176000,,3536,4.460587326120557

It makes no difference that took place under Canadian law, the US family court system is just as ridiculous & just as unconcerned with the welfare of children.  Our story did not mirror the tragedies withstood by Kate & David but only by the grace of God; it certainly did mirror it in so many other ways.  I have read the horror stories of many other grandparents & parents who have had to battle through not only the extremely difficult situation of dealing with a parent who is mentally/emotionally unstable but also the court system who insists on protecting the parent at all cost for no other reason than they were able to reproduce.  I was deeply saddened that this family had to suffer through such a nightmare but am so very grateful for their work to try to correct some injustices in the system & for this movie that tells the story of so many children.",1442102400,,1000,4.50828729281768

I did not cry but was horrified to say the very least at how one set of parents could be so unfortunate as to have the same murderer not only murder their only son but also their only grandchild.  Such failures on the part of the justice system seem ludicrous.  I feel for the parents of Andrew and I feel for anyone who suffers such extreme tragedies in their lives and don't choose to end the suffering by ending their own lives.  I wish both Andrew and Zacharys parents/grandparents peace until they are reunited if that is what actually happens when we leave this earth.

3692488,4,B001M564BQ,"Kurt Kuenne tells a great story, here. The narrative entertains and engages, which is critical to the subject. Without the skilled storytelling, the film would not be what it is: a superb tribute to Zachary, his father, and the family and friends that formed them as people. It's also a vitally important story that speaks to the core of who we are and what we value: family, friends, lovers, community, connection. It grapples with law and government and basic needs from these institutions: safety, justice.

The pictured artwork for the DVD is lovely and uniquely suited to the film. The colors and design communicate so much that the film touches on. It illustrates the beauty, love, humor, creativity, wit and a sense of connection we value in those around us. The tree and its roots illustrate the diverse systems within its influence, and is an apt metaphor for Zachary's father and the the film itself.

Ok, so now that we have gotten that out of the way, this is an amazing documentary. It is absolutely gut wrenching and it will shatter your heart and soul. You will not be able to stop thinking about it for days, you will find it hard to sleep without disturbing thoughts creeping into your mind, you will go on to tell everyone you know that they must also subject themselves to the horror, you know, so you're not so alone. If you have not seen this do yourself a favor and watch it, it really does have a point, and our justice system has to be changed. Even with the emotional toll it takes, I feel that it is an important documentary to watch.

SPOILER ALERT BELOW:
I saw this documentary about 8 moths ago and my heart still breaks every time I think of Zachary's grandparents. To lose their son and then get a new sense of hope from that baby, only to have him snatched away as well, broke me. The scene where the grandmother talks about Zachary being asleep, opening his eyes and looking right into her own eyes, and seeing her son all over again was devastating. That baby was everything to her and her husband and from the home videos they were everything to him as well. Just a devastating story all around.",1417132800,3,1493,4.351254480286738

How the Bagbys held themselves together so remarkably after such devastation in their lives is beyond me - I have the utmost admiration and respect for them.  I hope the love of their son's friends surrounds them with warmth and comfort for all of their days.

This is an absolutely beautiful tribute from a friend who wanted his deceased friend's son to know all about his father - hearing about him from the mouths of friends, colleagues, people who loved him.  He wanted Zachary to know how special his father was and what type of child grown to man he was.  A beautiful and sensitive idea, and the way his friends describe Andrew, the viewer can't help but love him either.

The dignity which David and Kate showed in their handling of such loss and their decision to become activists so no one else should have to experience what they did is courageous and selfless.  One cannot walk away after viewing this documentary without having the fullest respect for them- and the hope that they time has helped to heal some of their loss.

A gripping documentary.  I watched it 4 times just to grasp what everyone was saying.  You will be astonished and stupefied at Canada's judicial process.
While Americans view Canadians as free and easy-going, they are oblivious to the Rule of Law the United States abides by, and they are DANGEROUSLY uneducated concerning the evaluation, diagnosis and prognosis of psychosis in humans, and seem not to ever rely on the intuitive warning signs that something's amiss - warning signs that a 1-year-old was able to comprehend.
Honestly, I'm never interested in movies or documentaries where it's obvious right from the start that not only is the producer/director a secular humanist - an altruistic, brainwashed, politically correct egalitarian as well - but so are all of the friends and family of he and the subject of the documentary, as well as all of the other like-minded characters in the film; but in this instance, I put my prejudices aside and finally watched this production all the way through.

The cruel way it had to end is painful enough for those of us not lucky enough to have met the Bagby family; trying to imagine how they not only survived this hell on earth, but rose to fight injustice & inspire so many others around the world.

There exists no words in our dictionary harsh enough for the woman (Shirley) who does the unthinkable and changes the lives of a family FOREVER. However, I never feel quite close about Andrew. The story really becomes about his parents and what courageous people they really are. We see a bunch of snapshots of Andrew as a kid in front of the director/narrators camera growing up. We don't know much about how Andrew and Shirley met and what even drew him to her in the first place. We don't know about her beginnings or anything. We are thrust thinking Andrew is completely blameless- however, he has to bear some responsibility in continuing a relationship with a psychotic, much older woman. We don't know her past but are immediately told she's a PSYCHO. The details (and just a few) emerge towards the end. The movie doesn't flow very cohesively. The audio and editing is TERRIBLE. The narrator sounds TERRIBLE. He sounds like he's reading way too fast, like if he had a time restriction and there was only so much space left on the tape.

The story is gripping, depressing, and just heartbreaking. You wish that this documentary had never been made. But you see the awe-inspiring couple who truly leave an impact in this film and hope that they continue the legacy for many years to come.",1404259200,6,1460,4.658914728682171

3692525,3,B001M564BQ,"Star ratings have a built in caveat: you sometimes are torn between liking how the film works and hating the story. So to find a happy medium, I had to give it three stars.

In all honesty I wish this movie had never been made, because I wish the events had never transpired. Without giving away too much, this is the story of a young man who was manipulated to death, literally. Then if that weren't enough, the person who was responsible does the impossible. Ultimately however this is a love story, between two people who watch their future dissolve at the hands of a mentally deranged individual, who may go down in the annals of film making as the most selfish person to have ever walked this planet. Adolph Hitler comes in a close first. Seriously.

It's hard not to come away without compassion when watching this film. Normally it's easy to tune out events that are jarring and flash before our eyes like a car wreck, but this film delicately balances between the joy and love this family has, and the tragic events that befall them. It's not enough we see the world through the eyes of the filmmaker (who also composed the music for), we also are privy to perspectives from key people in this documentary, even the one who is responsible for it's darkness.

By the end, you know him. Bags. Even days later, trying to tell people about this story, you will still cry. there are no police officers, or the man that found his body. just friends and family, those who loved him.

The story get more tragic as it goes along, till your heart is ripped from the seams in the last 20 (?) minutes.

If you don't like a good cry, pass. But if you can handle it, it's a fantastic journey into the mind of a beautiful man, and the justice system.",1390176000,2,731,3.9591836734693877
3692533,4,B001M564BQ,"If you haven't seen this or know little of the story, stop reading about it before you see it, as there are some plot twists that prove life truly is stranger (and sicker) than fiction. But do be ready for a very very sad tale.

I really enjoyed the love that fills the film, especially towards Andrew from his friends and family. You can't help but feel deeply for his parents, more so as it goes along and you see all that they have dealt with. They're a wonderful pair of people. Likewise their son, who made more friends than most anyone I've ever met. I've surely never known a guy who was best man at five weddings! I know over a hundred men and the next highest best man count is three. (Sidenote: when Andrew says at his oldest pal's wedding that ""I love him and I know he loves me"", watch the bride's face; it's one of the few funny moments you'll find here).

Kuenne does a good job at getting us to like his pal, and seeing as Kurt has so much old footage of Andrew, it fills out the narrative on a much deeper level than most documentaries can. Still, I don't feel like I know much about Andrew even after all of that. I know everyone loved him, but there were too few really personal moments. I got the feeling that the agenda was to show only the good, no matter what. A few edgier moments would have added more depth to the portrait.

The problem with lionizing your subject is that it starts feeling manipulative, a line which every doc must tread very carefully. It all went way overboard for me when the soundtrack drums started doing a loooong slow bolero during a scene leading up to one of the tragedies. It was terrible filmmaking at that point, as we were being slammed over the head: ""Start worrying! Something bad is about to happen. Uh oh, the foreboding music is getting louder, even though the pictures are nice...something bad is coming! Be afraid!"" I was saddened at that moment, as Kuenne had wisely underplayed things up until then. But seeing as he wrote the music as well as editing and shooting all of this, perhaps he just got a bit carried away. Hard to blame him: few directors have this much connection with their subject.

Spoilers coming...

The best part of this film to me is how it highlights the work the Bagbys have done trying to prevent the same tragedy happening to another family. The Canadian legal system clearly killed that baby. Period. The judges and lawyers involved must and should be living lives filled with daily shame for what they did to that baby and his incredibly loving grandparents. I love that the Bagbys refused to be cowed into not having their press conference. F the law indeed, as Mr Bagby says, for trying to stop them from exposing how selfish and uncaring the lawyers and judges were when they were needed to protect that child. But then we've all met more than a few government employees whose only real concern is their paycheck and their pension, and not the people who pay them.

As for the witch/bitch/evil lowlife that the Bagbys call the Devil, the less said of her the better. Except this one conveniently ignored fact, which no one in the film dared say yet must have thought: Andrew is not entirely blameless in all of this. Although he is painted as a total victim, HE chose to continue seeing and being in contact with her even after she proved to be a true psycho. And let's be very honest here: why the hell would he get her pregnant?! What was he thinking? That was his fault and no one else's, and if he hadn't slept with her even after he knew she was obsessed with him then she would never have been able to kill their child, and quite possibly would not have even killed Andrew. One assumes she did kill him as she knew she was pregnant and knew he was going to marry another woman, just as she tried to blame her murder of the child on her new boyfriend. What a true scumbag.

One thing Kuenne really dropped the ball on was not mentioning the details of her previous crimes earlier in the film. By sticking them near the end we get a less complete picture of how sick this monster was...but then it would also have made Andrew look a lot less wise in continuing to see her. And the agenda here is clearly to sanctify him and demonize her. Which is part of the manipulation that pulls this film down a bit.

But in the end, even with the occasionally overdone music and the details moved around to shed the director's friend in the best possible light, it's a deeply moving film. And, one hopes, a serious warning to anyone dealing with a psychotic bitch (or man...it goes both ways in cases like this, as the news proves daily).

The real heroes here are the Bagbys, and god bless them for their efforts on behalf of other victims. If their work and this film helps change the miserable system of protecting perps before victims, then it's done a great service, as have the Bagbys. I wish them and all of Andrew's friends the very best. If there's one thing we can all learn from this story: if your friend is being tormented by a psycho, DO SOMETHING! Better to call the police than be called by the coroner...

This is a film worth watching, no doubt, but don't expect to come away feeling very happy. Still, Andrew brought a lot of fun and love into the world, so perhaps the real lesson here is the old classic: cherish your loved ones every day you're with them, because fate is a cruel mistress and today might just be all you've got.

I agree with everyone else about the emotional impact, plus the film maker is so brilliant in the way he tells the outrageous, sad story, and the way he arrives at the conclusion.

The parents are people to learn from.  They are remarkable, and good examples to the rest of us.

Our society and judicial systems need to focus on victims and not on sadxss criminals!  I want to hear about good people, like Kate and David's stories, not from the sorry losers'.

What an emotional roller coaster, a superb job of pulling you in immediately and laying the film out as to where it brought various emotions even as to when tragedy would arise.

Also, because the filmmaker is so close to the family at the center of this documentary, you can't help but feel as though you're getting a very one-sided view of the situation and the way the film openly mocks members of the Canadian government is childish.  It is obviously a film designed to get support for their cause, and I think I would be more inclined to support it if the film had been a little more detached, a little more professional.",1366156800,10,717,4.534883720930233

I wanted a copy immediately upon viewing it, but at the time, it was not available for purchase. Prior to it being released, I just never ""got around to it"" when I thought of going back and checking availability again....but even now, three years later, this documentary will still pop into my thoughts at the oddest times.

This story is completely haunting. It is, bar none, the most emotionally compelling piece of work that I have ever seen in my life. I am a single, career-focused woman with no children and absolutely no desire for them. I consider myself fairly pragmatic. I have been known to tear up occasionally if the film is moving, but this is the first film that I can honestly say had me crying hard enough that I required a box of tissues along with eyedrops and advil for the headache when it was over.

Stylistically, the film move *very* rapidly and requires strict attention or you may miss a key piece of information in merely a few seconds. That is not difficult however, as it commands your attention quite easily and effortlessly. If you're anything like me, you'll find it almost impossible to look away. The rapid fire twists and turns that this story takes feel almost like consecutive punches and leave you completely breathless. By the end, all I could think was that if I was in the Bagbys shoes, I would not have had their strength of character. I admire them more than I can say.

I cannot recommend this title highly enough. It is utterly riveting and worth 5 times the cost of the product. This is a story you will never *ever* forget once you see it.",1355443200,3,1706,4.493548387096774

Watching this was a tiring act that never lets you hang on to one emotion for a particularly long time. At moments it is reflective, somber or even funny as Andrew and his friends seemed like genuinely nice and hilarious people. It was almost a somber feeling watching home videos of them, for they might just remind you of you and your close friends. However, the film then thrusts you into the horrifying crime against Andrew and the fallout of his loved ones is documented in such a powerful yet respectful way, that only a close friend (such as our filmmaker here) could have presented us. Yet in between the heavy emotions of sadness arises anger at how these crimes could have been prevented. Soon enough though Kurt weaves in and out of more emotional landscape and tugs at all different heartstrings for the duration of the film. It's almost enough to make you feel bi-polar but once the film has its hooks in you, it is seemingly impossible to get them out until the credits role.

I would like to dive deeper into something I mentioned casually in the previous paragraph and that is the creator of this work Kurt Kuenne. Due to the fact that he was one, if not thee closest friend to Andrew it is incredible to watch him interview people whom he has known most of his life about somebody they were all touched by. He speaks with a warmth and nostalgic affection that most filmmakers who did not personally know their subjects could hold. The fact that this case and these people were such an important part of who he was, allows him to put a personal touch on this work that was mandatory (in my opinion) to be as touching as it was. As the film goes on and we pass the hour mark, we almost begin to feel that this work is almost as much therapy as it is a film for him. Also, from a completely aesthetic point of view the film is paced extremely well and never lags or comes across as filler. This man was able to give us ninety minutes of a compelling well told story. Also, maybe it was his closeness to his subjects, or it could have been the fondness they felt for him that allowed them to be as open and relaxed as everyone involved in the film appeared to be but it allowed me as a viewer to feel as if I was getting an honest recollection of the horrible events that had plagued the lives of these poor people.

I also applaud Andrews parents with great vigor, as it is hard to imagine all the emotion pain, hurt, regret, frustration and devastation these people felt and yet they are able to not only continue their humility but their want to do GOOD in this world. It was a humbling experience for me personally and showed me the depths of struggle that human beings could go through and still come out the other side with conviction and the will to right the wrongs, even the ones that don't affect them.

Finally, after the film was over and silence filled my apartment, I didn't know what today. I didn't feel I could go about a sunday evening, filling up time with trivial household chores to pass the time before going to sleep. So I sat there on my couch and I just though about every single emotion this film brought up in me. The importance of love and the urgency that is needed in life, as you never know when things could come to an end. This films running time on Netflix was ninety-one minutes but I found that horribly inaccurate as the film, its characters and ideas filled my head long after the screen went black. So, whom would I recommend this for viewing this film? Everyone. Your parents, your kids, your friends, significant others, co-workers, etc etc. While the seeds that planted the idea for this film are horrific and disturbing, it spurned the growth of a beautiful tree, rooted in suffering and hurt. Each branch of an idea in this film, giving us a new idea or feeling that could easily relate to ourselves or loved ones. I know I began this review by stating that no adjectives could describe how it made me feel and then I spent the entire review trying to do just that, so I apologize for making it seem like a paradox . So n conclusion please do yourself a favor and watch this film, I can guarantee it will have an impact on you, be it positive or negative is entirely up to you.",1344816000,5,4762,4.3592342342342345

This movie made me cry. Hard.

What can I say about it that hasn't already been said?

It's not only an amazing achievement in filmmaking (especially with the Oscar-worthy editing), but it draws you in like no other movie and once you grow close to these beautiful people that the film is about, they're ripped away from you, leaving the other people we care about in this film devastated and emotionally spent. You'll feel the same.

Andrew was lucky to have a friend such as Kurt to create such a loving tribute to him. That not only says a lot about Kurt, but it says a hell of a lot about Andrew.",1344729600,,682,4.346456692913386

3692578,4,B001M564BQ,"I was going to say have a good supply of tissues handy, but you may find anger a more immediate response than tears. Because the story is ultimately about a severe failure of justice. In this case, Canadian justice, but don't imagine it would have been any better in the US.

Kurt Kuenne is a documentary filmmaker. His best friend, Andrew Bagly, is murdered by a woman who had been his lover but did not accept it when Andrew broke up with him. She was a sociopath, from what we can see. In any case, not long after his death, the woman (I'm avoiding using her name) declared that she was pregnant with Andrew's child. The murder took place in Pennsylvania, and as soon as she recognized that she was the primary suspect, she fled back to her home in Newfoundland.

What followed was a nightmare of bureaucracy, with the Canadian government putting off the hearing on extradition over and over again until after the baby (Zachary) was born. Amazingly, they granted her bail, the judge arguing that even though her crime was a horrible one, she did not pose a danger to the community as a whole. What's more, she was given custody of Zachary over his grandparents' objections. They had moved to Canada to be near him and look after him while his mother was in prison.

So Kurt is traveling all over the US, filming people who knew and loved Andrew, organizing it as a letter to Zachary so that he would know something about the father he never met. But the film also recounts what was going on in Newfoundland while he was away. And that's where your blood may begin to boil.

I do not claim that Canadians are terrible people, or even that the Child Protective Services and the judges involved were bad people. But they certainly did not do the right thing by Zachary. As I say, I don't know if it would have been any better in the US.",1336694400,2,1836,4.439169139465875

If you have children, you will experience this story on a whole other level than as to someone who doesn't. I made the mistake of watching this before bed, which was NOT a good idea in the slightest, being as afterwards, the range of emotions I experienced, were too much to allow me to sleep. I went from crying, to being angry, feeling empathy for Andrew's parents and all they went through. Honestly, I think watching this at any time of day, will disturb you for a few days.

Andrew's parents, Kate and David Bagby, are the epitome of what I hope to be for my kids. They were incredibly close to Andrew, but raised him to be his own man. His parents are one of a kind and when you watch this, you will understand why.",1336003200,,882,4.218934911242603
3692580,5,B001M564BQ,"This is the first movie that I would give 5 out of 5 stars. What makes this so terrible is the fact that it is a documentary.

This is easily the saddest, most frustrating, and overwhelming story I've ever heard. After Andrew Bagby, a medical resident, is found murdered after breaking up with his girlfriend, and his girlfriend is found to be pregnant with his son, a longtime friend, Kurt Kuenne, sets out to make a movie for baby Zachary. The intention of the movie was to film interviews with all of Andrew's close friends and family so his son could have an idea of what great things people thought about his father.

The worst, or should I say, saddest, part about this film is that it is not a mystery. There is such a conclusive and shocking end to this story that you'll wish it wasn't so.

I don't want to give anything away. However, being that it is true; you could also just look it up and find out what happened. Still, I would recommend the movie over a simple news story. The emotional intensity displayed by Andrew Bagby's parents is something that I will never be able to forget.

It's been weeks since I watched this film and I think about it everyday.  I am not a parent, I am not even married but, there are so many aspects to this documentary both good and haunting that will last through my entire life.",1335657600,,1326,4.373983739837398

I have a 2 year old son and I ran upstairs to his room and held him while I cried. The feelings of sorrow and frustration the I feel are a mere scratch compared to the deep wounds that the Bagby's feel. Not only from Andrew's murder but than to have their grandson murdered by the same person. It is unbelievable that so much Devestation can happen to good people. She was truly an evil, spiteful, sick person. I can only hope that she is burning in hell right now. I feel so sorry for the Bagby's and how much pain and anger they must be experiencing. I would only pray that I may be spared that level of sadness and that someday they will find comfort. I am most disgusted by the actions of judge welsh. She obviously in not fit to serve as an officer of the court and should be removed. Her actions contributed to zachary's death and she should be held accountable.

Some of the comments on this board misguidedly attempt to rationalize things that the Bagbys could have done differently in order not to have suffered these terrible losses.  The point is that evil can force its way into the lives of good people, through no fault of their own.

The conduct of some of the family services bureaucrats, psychiatrist, and legal officers involved, was despicable and criminally negligent.  I have the highest admiration for the Bagbys in their drive and determination to change laws, while honoring the memories of their beloved Andrew and Zachary.

It is an excellent documentary.  The footage is thorough and carefully researched.  The interviews are well done.  The editing is effective and tells the story at a good pace without melodrama.

Much of the film is exactly the kind of oeuvre that anyone could wish for his child to have if tragedy struck.  Unfortunately, real life is unscripted and events unfold in ways that are difficult to predict and painful to know.  This is the most disturbing and upsetting film I have ever seen.  Having watched it, I am conflicted between wishing I could ""un-see"" it and feeling grateful that the director shared with viewers what a wonderful person his friend was - that he let the audience embrace him as their friend for a little while too.",1328745600,,954,4.603550295857988

3692598,5,B001M564BQ,"Andrew Bagby was a special young man with a big heart, whose potential was destroyed, his life cut short by a psychotic woman. This is his story--and more.

Andrew was a nice looking, friendly young man with a lot of personality, and a lot of drive. His death came as a shock to many people. The manner of his dying was especially horrific, coming at the hands of a woman he'd dated but had broken up with. She refused to accept that from him, and because he spurned her, she killed him, then fled the US for her native land of Canada. St. Johns Newfoundland, to be precise. Andrew's parents, Katie and David, fought to get her extradited back to the US to stand trial for the murder of their son. The plot thickened. It turned out that Shirley Turner, Andrew's ex and his killer, was four months pregnant with Andrew's child. What followed was a nightmare.

Katie and David moved from their home in California to Canada in order to be near their grandchild, and to be a part of his life, uprooting themselves from the home they'd lived in for some twenty-five years. In due course, Zachary was born. The legal shenanigans which ensued were extraordinary and ridiculous. Twice, the accused killer was set upon the streets, having been determined to be no danger to the community. Despite having three other children by three other men, all of whom had custody. Despite having threatened other lovers with suicide and/or death. If one examines Shirley Turner's actions preceding and following her murder of Andrew Bagby, it becomes incomprehensible that this could be.

And yet it was.

And the worst was yet to come...

My son Michael recommended this film to me, and I'll unabashedly admit I cried my eyes out. He'd warned me about that, told me to watch it without even knowing what it was about. He's very wise, my son. The film was heartwrenching, poignant, touching... a fitting tribute to a man I would have loved to be able to know. His friends cannot say enough good things about him. His parents are amazing--in their devotion to him, and to his son Zachary, and in being able to instill the love and respect that they have. They've had to be strong, in a world gone crazy.

I watched all the extras on this film, including Andrew's fire story, and his best man toast. And the home movies of Zacary. It's worth every minute of it. Kurt Kuenne has captured Andrew Bagby for posterity. I commend him for it, and recommend this film to everyone.",1323302400,2,2451,4.5972540045766594

That said, I found this documentary to be one of the most horrifying and beautiful story ever documented on film. I fell in love with the Bagby's while watching this story, and found myself in complete awe watching their love, courage, and strength of character throughout the evolution of this film.

 What this film so perfectly shows, is the best and worst of humanity at the same time. I was staggered, horrified, humbled, murderously angry, and finally, grateful to have watched this moving tribute to a man so many, many people loved. This film actually caused such an internal debate over if I should recommend it to my friend's and family. On the one hand, I felt that as many people as possible should watch this film if only to honor the life of a truly good man. While on the other hand, I knew, beyond any doubt, that watching this film is to have your heart torn out of your chest leaving a gaping wound.

 I am a first responder, so I wouldn't consider myself very thin-skinned at all. You learn quickly to develop coping skills to deal with some of the more tragic scenes you may be exposed to. Yet, with all of the things witnessed through the years, there are moments in this films that had me crying... Not a tear or two, but genuine crying...

 So, to solve the dilemma I have recommended it, but with a clear warning that it will leave you emotionally drained. You must watch it only when you have an entire day free afterward. I promise, you will be left completely drained and useless for hours afterward. I will close with the wish that I could let the Bagby's know just how much I respect and look up to them.

The Bagbys are the strongest people I've ever seen. I would have jumped off a bridge by now if I'd have gone through the things they have. God bless that entire family.",1292976000,31,781,4.342465753424658
3692626,2,B001M564BQ,"This film did not give me room to cry or make up my own mind, but succeeds as a powerful document of a brutal, intensely felt family history. I became numbed from the overemphatic tone. Like a tabloid newspaper, it canonizes the grandparents in broad strokes, while the murderous female, and Newfoundland's justice system, were conversely demonized, and dehumanized to a level that is cartoonish. The filmmaker actually uses still photos of the judges, and animates their mouths as he reiterates their words over and over(amateur hour all the way). The events are tragic. Ms. Turner is no doubt a vicious psychotic who murdered a human being, and then exploited the justice system. What I'm in doubt about is the endless hagiography of Andrew and his parents. It's overdone, and maudlin. Nobody is that heroic, unfailingly good, and true in such overblown Arthurian proportions. The grandparents are strong, stubborn, and have a great deal of ego strength. However, my dread increased as I watched the way they tried to play Shirley Turner. They speak to her in a condescending manner at all times. Even though I know it was the last thing they wanted, I'm thinking that they possibly provoked the ultimate tragedy. How long did they think they could continue playing make believe, patronizing an unstable killer, and get away with it? I know that they wanted to rescue baby Zachary ASAP, as anyone loving parent or grandparent would. But a streetwise person knows that the wheels of justice turn slow. One thing this film is not is ""streetwise"". This film becomes a black-and-white battle of good versus evil. It ultimately lacks any subtlety, or gray area, or genuine insight. The film leaves too many unanswered questions. What was the root of Andrew's low self-esteem? If Andrew's parents were so loving and perfect, why did he think so little of himself? Perhaps Andrew was a decent enough fellow, but I never got to know the real man, regardless of how many grieving friends testified to his greatness. Was Ms. Turner's life-long history of restraining orders and stalking incidents introduced into evidence? Were the judge's hands tied by the letter of the law? I wish more legal experts, and mental health professionals had been interviewed. It would be great to see a documentary on these events that was less one-sided, more insightful, and informative, which didn't have such an intrusive ""I"" character constantly chattering, and manipulating the audience. There are two kinds of documentaries. There's the Michael Moore grabbing-you-by-the-neck kind, which pushes your face into the subject matter like someone house-training a puppy. There's also the Frederic Wiseman documentarian, who shows, but doesn't tell, who allows the audience to observe, and gather their own truths.

This is a raw emotional juggernaut, you are not ready for it (nobody is) and never will be, but nonetheless you need to watch this movie.

There is no equal in documentary movie history.

I think it is touching that a lifelong friend would travel this journey just to give a little boy a story about the father he would never get to know.  This movie will make you happy, sad, and most of all very angry.  But, this story isn't one to ignore and I truly believe that so many can make a difference in making sure that the ending this documentary has doesn't ever, ever, ever happen again.  I am sure that some will avoid watching this because it involves a highly emotional subject - but this isn't political except in the sense of a system failing a family.

I read some reviews and sat down to watch, satisfied that I was familiar with the story being presented. I had, I thought, seen enough of these types of documentaries to be prepared for what I was going to see. I could not have been more wrong.

As the title suggests the film starts as a 'doculetter', addressed to the son of a murdered man (Dr. Andrew Bagby). The filmmaker was a close friend and had gathered together footage from their childhood, through adulthood together with tributes from their friends with the intent of helping the child understand what kind of a man his father was. Not wishing to give too much away, he goes on to explain the events leading up to the murder and builds on the child's blooming relationship with his grandparents (the parents of the murdered man). In the face of such a terrible tragedy these people were the model of dignity and restraint, showing incredible love and devotion to the little boy.

It's then that the second, savage twist kicks in and the focus of the film shifts to the grandparents, the terrible injustices they suffered at the hands of ""the system"" and the unity that united family and friends in a common goal. What strikes you the most is how many lives Dr. Bagby touched. How special ordinary people can be.

I wasn't prepared for this. My 2 year old daughter was in the room when I started to watch it and as the story unfolded I could only look at her and cry.

As others have said, you need to pick the right time and place to watch this film but it's definitely in the ""Must See"" category. Its message and its value simply cannot be overstated.",1288310400,6,1763,4.482866043613707

First of all, as many others have said, go in as ignorant as possible.  The less you know, the better.

Second, keep the tissues on hand because you will cry...a lot...and probably from the start.

Third, try to watch it in the middle of the day on a weekend when you don't have much left to do, so that you are not expected to be remotely productive for awhile.

Finally, just be prepared to get emotionally destroyed.  This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I love that I think my life is better for knowing this story, but there are certain things that you can never un-know.

It's an emotional rollercoaster - I was moved, amused, angry, and depressed by turns.  Be prepared: it will make you cry, especially if you have kids.

I am suspicious of these heavily emotional accounts of these highly complex series of events.  Has the author ever considered the medical history of Ms. Shirley Turner ?  Unfortunately, this subject was just briefly glossed over.  The influence of long-term anti-depressant and anti-psychotic medication is likely a key influence in the bizarre behavior of this otherwise intelligent woman.  Therefore, I do not consider this work to contain the proper degree of objectivity expected by a journalist.  Instead, the author exploits a tragedy in the guise of 'fighting for justice'.  Call me a cynic, but I think my hunches are far closer to finding the 'truth' than this author ever intended.

3692634,5,B001M564BQ,"I'll be the first person to admit that I'm not big on watching documentaries. However, ""Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father"" is a must-watch film. It is a raw, heart-wrenching, stunning picture about the unfairness of life and the fallibility of the modern justice system.

The movie begins as a memorial project for the filmmaker, Kurt Kuenne, to tell the story of his best friend and to the friend's son. Through circumstances and life's intricacies, Kuenne weaves this film into an agenda and message that's more powerful and has far more reaching effect than Kuenne planned for in the beginning.

This documentary attests to the power of the human spirit. What makes some human beings pick up the pieces and not only stand up after a fall but to stand up and become advocates? One can only hope to have the amount of courage, bravery, and strength of character that Andrew's parents/Zachary's grandparents possess.

This film is so powerful and the true crime is so gruesome that the viewer is left to double-checking to see if it's truly non-fiction. Sadly, it is a true story.

What separates this documentary from many others is that although there is an alternative motive to telling the story that alternative motive isn't monetary gain as is so common in today's Hollywood; instead, it's to have an effect on the viewer, to encourage the viewer to seek action, to seek justice, to seek change. As a documentary filmmaker Kuenne accomplishes that rare feat of getting the audience involved in his story enough to make them go out and change the world.",1276387200,2,1573,4.814814814814815

I could not comprehend how there were people in this world that could do such terrible things...and ultimately get away with it. I'm a pretty understanding person, so not understanding the rationalization behind Shirley's thought process left me completely flabbergasted!

The way Kurt puts together the film really allows the viewer to become emotionally involved with all the people and the situation. Especially at the end, when the viewer's emotions become synchronized with the rhythm of the film.

I finished watching the movie with tears streaming down my face in both anger and sadness. The movie impacted me so much that I then wanted to know even more, so I did some online research for the rest of the day.

Someone shot Andrew after he moved to Pennsylvania to complete his residency. Shortly after the murder, Andrew's girlfriend discovered that she was pregnant with Andrew's child. Kuenne wanted to make ""one more film"" with his best friend, and he thought of it as a gift for Andrew's son, Zachary.

As many reviewers have noted, it is difficult to say much about the film without giving away its plot. There are many twists and turns. On one level, the film is about unspeakable evil. On another, it is about the strength and beauty of people.

We decided that sometimes evil happens in the world to show how loving and compassionate people can be and how evil sometimes brings out so much good in others. That is what this movie meant to me.

I caught it by chance on MSNBC flipping through the channels and something about it struck me and I wanted to keep watching it. I thought it was going to a typical true crime drama but I was so wrong. It's the story of how one woman took so much from so many people and caused so much hurt and pain. I can't imagine the pain this family must have felt and I don't want to give too much away because I think you should go into this movie not knowing the whole story and just watch it unfold. But everyone who knew this man, this child and this family took something so awful and pushed through their own pain to make something good for people so that this will not ever happen again. You will get angry, you will cry your eyes out but I hope when you watch this movie the thing you will take away is the love that poured out from everyone's heart. I hope it calls you to action.

The thing I also like is that the issues regarding the criminal case are so matter of fact. I felt the director never went out of his way to villify (sp?) the criminal. You just see for yourself how unjust everything was. The other thing is that these people seem so ordinary that they could be your neighbors or someone you knew. Just ordinary people who had this tradgedy thrust upon them and made the best out of it. You see the hurt and the pain and the anger but also their determination to help and protect others. What they went through to see Zachary... to choose to love their grandchild more then hate his mother to be with him... I don't know if I could do that.

We are fully introduced to young physician Dr. Andrew Bagby and come to know and care about him, his parents, friends, posthumously born son and extended family.  We also come to thoroughly despise his killer who commits another even more horrible murder before the film is finished.

I knew nothing about this case before viewing the film which was made by one of Andrew's longtime friends and provides lots of film footage of him at many stages of his life.  Andrew grew up as the only child and pride of his parents, Missouri born engineer David and British nurse Kate, in a comfortable home in Northern California.  His lifelong dream was to become a doctor and though he was not accepted at a US medical school he was admitted to one in Newfoundland.  At this  Canadian school he sadly met his killer though he also attained his medical degree.  He was happily finishing his residency in Latrobe, Pennsylvania when he was killed shattering the lives of many.

3692649,5,B001M564BQ,"Filmmaker Kurt Kuenne put his directing talents to work to create a tribute of his childhood friend who was slain by a rejected lover.  Andrew Bagby was the life of the party, everyone's best pal and best man, and someone that we would all want to call a friend.  Cut down in his prime at the age of 28, his distraught parents soon discover that the woman who killed their son and escaped to Canada to avoid prosecution is carrying their only grandchild. They quit their jobs and move to Newfoundland in order to acquire custody of their grandson and experience the travesty of the Canadian court system, as they are faced with having to maintain a cordial relationship with Shirley Taylor, the woman who killed their son (and has escaped extradition and prosecution for over a year) to ensure that they are a part of their grandsons life.

Kuenne goes on a 7200 mile odyssey in order to introduce young Zachary to the father that he will never know.  Combining interviews conducted with those who loved Andrew and his family, childhood movies, and voice over narration, Kuenne presents an emotion-packed film which soon takes a heart-wrenching turn that no one will expect.

I first got a glimpse of this incredible documentary on MSNBC while switching channels in a hotel room and was so riveted that I wanted to see the film in its entirety.  I can safely say that no documentary has had such a visceral affect on me. Sometimes I found the MTV-style editing to be a bit annoying, but liked that Kuenne injected his own wry observations and opinions of Shirley Turner's manipulation of the courts and the Bagby family into the film - reminding me of Kirby Dick's fantastic ""This Film is Not Yet Rated.""

In the end, Kuenne's film indicts the Canadian legal system for allowing an unstable suspected murderer to have custody of a child but also introduces viewers to probably the most inspirational couple - David and Kate Bagby, who have gone through hell and back and hope to see that no other family has to experience a similar tragedy.",1249257600,5,2040,4.697478991596639

His goal is to preserve the memory of his friend for his friend's son Zachary, who's mother, Shirley just so happens to be his father's killer. Strange? yes. What's even stranger is the complete failure of the Canadian justice system to fully prosecute Shirley and place baby Zachary in the caring hands of this grandparents(Andrew's parents) The documentary is very hard to watch but it's excellent and fearlessly done.

Judging by the amount of people interviewed, there was nobody he came in contact with whom he didn't leave a fantastic impression. Except the one person who took it all away.

Andrew was a student at a medical school in Newfoundland when he met Shirley. 12 years his senior, they began dating and it caught many of his friends off guard. They found her to be vulgar and crass. When Andrew began seeing the things his friends saw, he called it off. By this time he was performing his residency in Pennsylvania, and she was visiting from her new location of Iowa. He sent her on the plane back to Iowa, only to find that she returned a few days later. When she returned, Andrew was killed.

Shirley made her way back to Iowa while a coworker of Andrew's immediately pointed the police in her direction. As she talked with the police and concocted story after story, evidence began piling up. During this time, she headed home to Newfoundland, where extradition hearings would be moved and changed and piled on top of each other. It was announced that Shirley was pregnant with Andrew's child. When Zachary was born, it was immediately apparent that he was the spitting image of Andrew. His parents wanted custody and were given custody by Shirley when she was put in jail awaiting trial. The hoops they were required to jump through for her were absurd.

What follows in this documentary is raw and evocative. I don't know anybody who didn't just break down at least twice viewing this. The tragedies that amass for the family and friends of Dr. Bagby are heartbreaking and couldn't have happened to a less deserving family. Their strength and determination amazes me.",1242000000,4,1805,4.63125

It's shocking, and If you have a Netflix account it is essential that you sit down and spend an hour and half watching the documentary DEAR ZACHERY: A LETTER TO A SON ABOUT HIS FATHER.  I mention Netflix because it is part of their watch instantly section and I can say without a shadow of a doubt: you need to see this film.

Directed by Kurt Kuenne, it's a story about him on a quest to make a movie for Zachery Turner whose father, David Bagby,  was brutally murdered by his Mother.  When the Canadian courts let her go on bail it turns into a story of his Grandparents fighting to stay in Zachary's life.  These Grandparents never give up.  But mostly the story is about the people we leave behind and the legacy that we leave in their hearts.  If you think your life is useless, if you think you haven't made an impact on the people around you, then think again.  This movie pulls you in at the beginning and doesn't let go.

To tell you anymore about this story is to ruin the emotional impact of a film that will leave you in tears, and thanking God for the people around you.  In 90 minutes I laughed, cried, was made numb, angry, philisophical and by the end I rejoiced in the beauty of the human spirit.  I saw through some very dark turns that love can conquer all.  But more importantly I learned the giving up is never an option and that it's our duty to help those in need.

The film begins with some cheesy computer graphic logo, and the moniker MSNBC Films presents and maybe that's what  caught me off guard.  I almost turned it off right then and there.  But by the time it's over the cheesy little touches made the film feel like it was made by real people and not slick Hollywood documentary film makers.  It feels like one of those photo montages at a funeral, or a wedding.  It a small snapshot into the lives of of people ravished by tragedy and it ends on a bittersweet note that for once shows the power of real life.

DEAR ZACHERY is one of the most powerful and moving documentaries I've ever seen.  It's an emotional film that will leave you angry and yet hopeful.  It tells a story that can't be made up, it rejoices in the best of people, during the darkest periods of thier lives.  I've seen thousands of films in my life and DEAR ZACHERY is a rewarding film, that does what all great films do.  It makes you rejoice in the human spirit and demands that if we see something wrong we fix it.  Please see this film, I promise you won't regret it.",1238716800,6,2491,4.2601279317697225
3692659,5,B001M564BQ,"Do yourself a favor, and buy this DVD without reading too much about the plot.  I know that's asking for an awful lot of faith, but it pays off in spades.  I bought this on a friend's recommendation that consisted of, ""A guy makes a documentary about his friend who got murdered"".  Therefore, every single twist, turn, and plot-development hit my wife and I in the pits of our stomachs.  What a tragic story of courage and grace in the face of DISASTER.  We love you, Bagbys!!",1238284800,11,476,4.425287356321839
3692660,5,B001M564BQ,Unbelievable story.  You have to see it to believe it.  Very well done and highly recommended.,1237766400,,94,4.8125
3692661,3,B001M564BQ,"All the jump cuts, quick cuts, and voice-overs used to tell the true-life tragedy here - don't work for me. It ends up like a dish of cole slaw. I was almost going to give this film just 2 stars, but I bumped it up to 3 stars after a second viewing made the story clearer to me, and out of deference to the amateur filmmaker's sincere attempt to tackle such a serious subject.

However, if I hadn't read the DVD jacket, I would have been hard-pressed to tell what this film was about. It starts with a rapid-fire succession of talking heads lamenting - a friend - the life of the party - cool guy. What happened? Who? Even with the advance notice given by the DVD jacket, it still took me at least 15 minutes to start to get the drift of what crime this documentary was narrating.

Then later in the film, the use of an additional technique introduced some misplaced humor on top of the confusion. A still picture of one or two Canadian officials was shown, but their mouths were made to digitally move in rhythm with the background reading of some rapid-fire quotes attributed to them. Of course this was no doubt meant to emphasize the inanity of their response to the murders, but instead it can just come off as one of those comic ""interviews"" Conan O'Brien has used in his opening segments - an interview with the still photograph of some goofily mouth-moving public figure.

Through all this hectic hail of snippets, it's hard to get to know the victims. Only in the DVD bonus materials did I feel I finally got to know Andrew Bagby a little. These extras at last include a concerted view of him as he was recorded giving a wedding toast and then narrating a humorous camping incident.

Almost no effort is made to introduce us to the perpetrator at all, other than through a few presaging remarks made by the victims' family members regarding some inappropriate behavior they'd noticed. It's true that the theme of this movie is not the crime itself, but the shocking opacity of some parts of the Canadian legal system - a system that repeatedly allowed a dangerous person to go free. Still, I'd liked to have gotten to know both victims and perpetrator in a more concentrated, involving way.

In short, this documentary takes an MTV video approach. If that style of presentation clicks with you, you'll get something out of this film. If however, you prefer the slower, more chronological narrative style of most of the true-crime presentations on TV, you'll probably find much of this film unintelligible and distracting.",1237075200,16,2530,4.613333333333333
3692662,5,B001M564BQ,"When I first started watching DEAR ZACHARY I was a bit thrown by the filmmaker's unusual method of unraveling this real-life thriller: lots of rapid-fire edits, people talking on top of one another, lots and lots of sit-down interviews, jump cuts, etc., but in time it started to grow on me.  Before I knew it, I was completely enthralled by the twists and turns in the fascinating and ultimately tragic story.  And even though it is quite shocking, it is also a tribute to the human spirit, the power of love and the necessity of determination.  Don't miss this great film, one that I believe is the best documentary of 2008.  It's a crime that it was not nominated for an Oscar.  MAN ON WIRE, the Academy Award winning documentary of 2008 was quite good, but not as good as this (in my judgement).  You should decide for yourself.  Please see it!  But, be prepared to have your heart broken and mended.",1236384000,2,904,4.537037037037037
3692663,5,B001M564BQ,"When I first watched this on MSNBC, I knew this would be a touching documentary, but was not prepared for the full scope of events that were to take place. It made me angry that a justice system turned a blind eye.  There are many who bear culpability in this tragedy.  Many tears were shed while watching, whose heart cannot ache for the parents/grandparents of this family? The impact of watching this has been lasting.  Anyone who watches will be deeply touched by and saddened by what this particular family has had to and will likely endure for the remainder of their lives.",1236384000,4,579,4.601941747572815

The twist is shocking and left me sitting in shock for the rest of the film. I was headed to bed when it came on and I stay up for two hours watching it. It was just that good.

Really, have a box of tissues handy. This was a travesty but this film is beautiful!",1234742400,5,518,3.9711538461538463

If you have children, young or old, it hits 5x harder. If you have friends that you grew up with, this will hit hard. Just a great film about a tribute to a friend, a tribute to a great set of parents, and the impact one man can have. Everyone should see this film.",1234742400,68,436,4.265060240963855
3692666,5,B001M564BQ,"I watched this film the last time they showed it on MSNBC. It has an agenda that becomes apparent towards the end. For the most part however it is a devastating look into the lives of a family that has been through hell. I am a 27 year old construction worker and consider myself to be emotionally sound. That being said, this movie made me cry almost continually. You can't help but feel so much empathy for the principal characters. I would be leery of anybody who didn't tear up when watching this movie. If you don't cry for these people you are incapable of feeling for others.

I never saw such ludicrous laws that allowed this to happen. I spent 25 years working in Federal Corrections and worked with virtually every LEA in our country. Kurt poured out his heart and soul to this child and did so without holding anything back, telling Zachary the truth about everything. Several of us were discussing it and we're still in a state of disbelief that this could happen. My heart goes out to Andrew's parents and his co-workers at the hospital, who loved him like a brother. Justice has been served but it took a difficult battle to get the laws changed, to ensure this never happens again.",1229299200,55,788,4.676258992805756

there would not be the tragedy this story is about.
