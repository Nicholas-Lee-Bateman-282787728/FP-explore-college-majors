I found a love for this period in time and it made me want more.  I agree with you, it is NOT Downton Abbey with it's beautiful country side and lavish sets and stunning homes.  But if you love all things from this period and time. Give it a chance!!! It is the beauty of change between the Classes and a very subtle Women's Rights and people fighting for equality in only a way the British can do it.

So had I not watched this I may have never found my love affair with this period and others.  I never would have found Jane Eyre, Elizabeth the 1st or The Tudors and I may have never had the pleasure of 6 lovely seasons with the Crawley's.  It is difficult to go back to what was cutting edge TV  that can not hold a candle to what we have today.  But!!!! If you allow your self to be immersed into these characters lives and peel it away from the stage sets, you just might find your self enjoying a wonderful series!

5 stars for a wonderful show for it's time.",1472515200,,1099,4.018433179723503
