PLEASE BE AWARE, THOUGH, THAT (CONTRARY TO WHAT AMAZON STATES) THIS MAY NOT BE A ""STANDARD-FORMAT"" (NTSC) DVD LIKE WE NORMALLY HAVE HERE IN AMERICA --- THE DISC I RECEIVED (from an Amazon private seller located overseas) IS A PAL-FORMAT DISC (""UK import""), A TOTALLY DIFFERENT TYPE OF DVD THAT IS USED IN SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND SO IT WILL NOT PLAY ON MANY AMERICAN BRANDS OF DVD PLAYERS, which are designed to play only NTSC/Region 1 discs!  Now, in my case, this was not a problem, since I happened to have Memorex MVD-2040 and MVD-2022 DVD players that do seem to be capable of playing a variety of movie-disc types, such as PAL and VCD formats.  These Memorex DVD players are apparently discontinued models, but are available through Amazon.",1331683200,,800,4.911111111111111
8021846,2,B000244FCI,"I thank my lucky stars that I purchased this item used. This ""documentary"" starts you with a five minute jumble of footage regarding disasters in general and having nothing to do with airships at all! It is followed by an incredibly long and wandering history of lighter-than-air travel - again having nothing to do with the title of this DVD. The producers' mantra should have been: ""This DVD is entitled The Hindenburg Disaster"" and stuck to it. Unfortunately, they did not.

 The only real items of interest are the speculation on the fabric skin and the actual footage of the disaster because it includes both minutes prior to the explosion and much of the aftermath. There is also some interesting footage (filler)of a replica of the control car from the disaster movie ""The Hindenburg"" or was it ""The Movie Disaster Hindenburg"" and a fabulous museum in Germany with a fullscale replica of the passenger accomodations. I would have given this item a ""1 star"" had it not been for the above. YMMV",1104278400,14,999,4.8023255813953485
