8012627,5,B0001H9EFY,"If you are both an Ernest fan and a sports fan, I defenitely recommend this video. Ernest and his friends show great skits on how great sports are. I really like how Ernest tells his dummy puppet Woody what he may do with his day and how Woody talks back to him by calling him a knucklehead. Watch out if you are going to be in a wrestling match. Chainsaw Chester dares Ernest to challenge him in a wrestling contest, but Ernest lies and says the viewer is Ernest the Furnace(Vern, that is). How amusing and funny this is for any fan of both Ernest and Sports. Know what I mean?",1265414400,,578,4.216216216216216
8012628,4,B0001H9EFY,"The video was somewhat old when I first watched it, but it is still very entertaining. It shows Ernest and many of his friends that are just as funny as him. At least VHS cassetes are still popular as well as DVDs. I remember the last time I saw the Hey Vern It's Ernest show. It was back in the early 1990s. The episode I saw was Hey Vern It's Food! I liked the one part where Ernest stacked canned food and they fell down. Anyway, in this video, I can see that Ernest sure had a way with caring for just about any kind of pet you could think of(in a funny sort of way). Anybody who is an Ernest fan should buy this show! They may not know what they are missing. Know what I mean?",1262822400,,681,3.9420289855072466
