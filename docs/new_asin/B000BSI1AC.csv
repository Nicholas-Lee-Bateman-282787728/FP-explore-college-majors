2439475,4,B000BSI1AC,"very helpful for a novice like me. although it seems complicated when you put it into pratice it becomes more simple and the
 more you study it the better it becomes",1399248000,,165,4.32258064516129
2439476,4,B000BSI1AC,It sure did answer lots of questions I had about the DP-03.  Nice thing about a DVD is that you can go back over sections until they make sense to you.  Trainer obviously put alot of time into making this video and must have made many changes to make it clearer to the student/viewer.  Nice pacing and the chapters made sense.  Length of DVD just about right as well.,1374105600,,367,4.27536231884058
2439477,5,B000BSI1AC,I have always enjoyed TEAC-TASCAM products and have purchased many of the companies offerings through the years. I have never been disappointed with anything except maybe my slowness in learning how to use the equipment.,1368748800,,220,5.314285714285714
2439478,3,B000BSI1AC,"The DVD was a good start; however, I wanted more. I was interested in learning to use the foot switch. I was also interested in learning to create DVDs so I could backup my recordings to play on computers and TVs. Other than that the DVD was fine.",1362355200,,247,4.166666666666667
2439479,5,B000BSI1AC,I bought this for a friend who has just purchased a Tascam DP-03. he is belighted with the training DVD. Excellent value and service from Amazon . Thank you.,1360108800,,157,4.448275862068965
2439480,3,B000BSI1AC,Like the easy control - not much option for a mix-down - playing back recorded songs are time consuming - reloading /song. But wish it included a midi input.,1331769600,3,157,4.448275862068965
2439481,5,B000BSI1AC,I really think this helps a lot. Helps get you started and takes out the confusion.,1430697600,,83,4.25
2439482,4,B000BSI1AC,"I am a visual learner, so watching the instructor work the knobs and buttons was better for me than reading the manual.  He spoke at a good pace (so I could jot notes) and broke up the material nicely.  I was able to record a half-dozen tracks quickly from this DVD lesson.",1423699200,,273,4.230769230769231

2439484,4,B000BSI1AC,Very helpful.....but go slowly and practice with your recorder one step at a time. It's a lot to absorb at one sitting!!,1421884800,,120,4.5
2439485,5,B000BSI1AC,This product is a wonderful addition when purchasing the TASCAM DP-03. Very clearly presents the training needed to get the most out of the recording studio.,1421452800,,157,5.076923076923077

2439488,3,B000BSI1AC,"Well explained and nicely presented. Beginners like me would never get by with the manual alone.
But, do think it's overpriced for what it is.
In fact; why pay at all for a proper explanation of how to use the product we've just forked out a lot of money for ?",1411257600,5,260,4.117647058823529
2439489,4,B000BSI1AC,"Very good, without it just having the manual isn't enough...........",1408147200,,68,5.9
2439490,5,B000BSI1AC,"Totally excellent: whether a novice or a pro, this tutorial will shorten the learning-curve dramatically! The presentation is clear and concise. The teacher is amiable and likeable. TASCAM should include this DVD with the machine: A great value and worth every penny!",1406073600,,267,5.380952380952381
8091797,5,B000BSI1AC,"Purchased recorder for my husband for Christmas last year.  He was struggling a bit with just the manual so I purchased the video and it has made all the difference.  Easy to understand, step by step instructions made it easy peasy.",1470614400,,232,4.634146341463414
8091798,5,B000BSI1AC,This DVD tutorial takes you sequencialy through the basic steps of recording and builds upon the editing features.  A great way to hone and enhance your recording skills as well as a refresher review.,1466121600,,200,4.882352941176471

8091801,1,B000BSI1AC,"The price is outrageous, the content is rushed, and so much is sloughed over that all you can think of is:'I need a manual!""

DON'T BUY IT! it's total crap!",1455753600,,156,4.2
