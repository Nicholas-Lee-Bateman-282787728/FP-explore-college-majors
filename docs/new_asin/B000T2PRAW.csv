8207668,5,B000T2PRAW,Great DVD selection with many unseen footage covers the war on the eastern from a strategic view. Covers the war from the beginning to end with reason why the war started. Great DVD to purchase covers the war in an unbiased opinion.,1526601600,,232,4.5476190476190474
8207669,5,B000T2PRAW,really bad place to be the Russian front now I see the horror first hand what a hell on earth all the suffering the lust for power the ss units and the Russians were animals a bounty was offered by the soviet high command for every ss armband the ss shoot prisioners out of hand,1409875200,,278,4.072727272727272
8207670,3,B000T2PRAW,"They show war footage (probably from the eastern front). The narrative is definitely about the eastern front. The problem I have with this documentary is that (for the most part) the narrative does not match the footage they are showing. The narrative is informative, but the footage appears to be random. Instead of this DVD, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-of-the-Century-When-Hitler-Fought-Stalin/dp/B00097DY6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War of the Century - When Hitler Fought Stalin</a>, which is also a documentary about the eastern front (a better one, in my opinion).

8207671,4,B000T2PRAW,I bought this for an 89 yr old friend who LIVED through this.  He said it was an excellent DVD.,1362009600,,95,3.75
8207672,5,B000T2PRAW,This is a very good 2 dvd set with a great narration by actor John Hurt (1984). It's all B&W but still has some remarkable footage.,1308096000,,131,4.076923076923077
8207673,5,B000T2PRAW,These two DVDs are very informative and they contain much information that is not generally known to the average person,1222128000,2,119,5.0
8207674,5,B000T2PRAW,Incredible footage. I thought I was pretty familiar with film footage from the Eastern Front but I saw a lot of material on this video that I had never seen before. Fantastic program. I caught a number of minor errors. In some cases footage did not match the historical period it was illustrating. That happens. No big deal in my opinion.,1208736000,8,338,4.557377049180328
8207675,5,B000T2PRAW,"The footage is astonishing. I watched a lot documentaries before. About 30-40% of this one was unknown to me, something new. The episodes with the tank's top shoot out clean from the tank's body got stuck in my mind. My uncle was a T-34 tank driver at WW2. He got through such incidents twice, losing the rest of crue comrades.
  About commentary: are you watching this for a commentary? Trying to get a deep knowledge from the film? Better read the books and enjoy the picture.",1202515200,21,478,4.546511627906977
8207676,2,B000T2PRAW,"There's some good footage here, although not much new for anyone who's seen other documentaries on the Russian front. The numerous errors really start to become irritating after a while though. Not only factual and historical errors, but even basic geography, such as: [paraphrase] ""The Soviet North front would attack through the Balkans [?] and defend Leningrad."" How about the ""Ju-88 Stuka?"" Or ""the Panzer III had a top speed of 18 mph?"" Who edits this stuff? The anachronistic use of footage is also extremely annoying, although fairly common in WWII documentaries, such as showing Tiger tanks or Henschel 129s while talking about Barbarossa. For the price it's not bad if you want to see some historical war footage, but if you want accuracy this isn't the one.",1198195200,37,767,5.0
