512697,4,6302798485,"Mae West stars as a brassy dame from San Franciso, a woman who uses her feminine wiles to her advantage. She also has a string of possessive men after her. After being trapped with a nightclub owner for quite some time, she escapes on board a cargo ship and forms a romance with the captain. When a christian woman arrives heading to the north to save people, West starts to reform. She is so much changed that when the woman dies, she takes her place to help the struggling church in the area to expand and help even the most difficult sinners.

An unusual story for West feels the same as her other films; the dialogue is well written and snappy and West's purring character is still the same woman. The only problem with the movie is its length. Although brief films can be welcome sometimes, this movie seems prematurely abbreviated. It would have benefitted from better developed relationships between characters.",1155686400,,918,4.701863354037267
512698,4,6302798485,"Yep, that's the title of the opening song sung by Mae in her San Francisco revue. But the oriental mood must've been before the cameras starting rolling, because now Mae's tired of being kept by her Chinese lover--hey, no wonder this thing had to be censored, that's far too disturbing for 1930s Middle America. Well before long, Mae's weighing anchor on a ship bound for the Klondike and captained by lovesick Victor McLaglen. Certain circumstances cause Mae to have to pass herself off as a missionary once she lands in the Klondike, with the result being one heck of a sermon before the drunken miners and dance hall gals. She's something else again, that Mae!",998524800,9,663,4.773913043478261
512699,3,6302798485,"This is the movie in which Mae West finally lost her battle with the censors. Constantly pushing the envelope, she wrote a script about a whore disguised as a missionary. They cut it to ribbons, and this rather  pointless melodrama is the result. Throughout the film, Mae rolls her eyes  in silent frustration, and is finally forced to utter some pathetic  shopworn sentiment at the end. It was 34 years before she could be herself  on screen again -- as the lusty talent agent in ""Myra  Breckenridge,"" sashaying into her office with the words ""all  right boys, get out your resumes.""",964137600,11,584,4.732673267326732
512700,4,6302798485,"West stars as a woman on the lam for a murder (self-defence) who heads out for the Yukon on McLaglen's ship. He falls in love with her, finds out her problems and helps to pass her off as the missionary Annie Alden (who died  on board ).Some find West as a missionary (saving souls in her risque way)  as tasteless; others find her hilarious-it all depends on what tickles your  fancy. The story is refreshing yet unfortunately, the script was laundered  to please the censors and there was much cut from the original shooting  script.",947548800,12,535,4.589473684210526
512770,5,6302798485,"Okay, you don't get the eye candy of Cary Grant - but Mae has never been better than she is in this broad, marvelous comedy. She sings - and darn well, she was an accomplished blues singer - in eye-popping costumes and with fabulous sets. She preaches - and saves a frontier church - by getting all the drunks in town to attend and repent (and this is the Klondike, so there are plenty of them!) She swishes and sways, leers, fascinates and generally hogs the whole center of the movie as only she ever could. I adore this, and I'm a long time fan who's watched all of her work many, many times. I was thrilled when this appeared on DVD after a long absence. If you love this diva/goddess of love, I promise she was never better.",1395705600,,729,4.251798561151079
512771,4,6302798485,"Mae West as her typical femme fatale, seducing men and leaving them in her wake. However, this time she assumes the identity of a missionary and heads for the Klondike to save the souls of the miners with rousing honky-tonk hymns that fill the church with sinners eager to repent. How can she juggle her new-found piety with her love for the bold sea captain and the handsome mountie. It's definitely worth having for fans of Mae West or the Gold Rush days.",1370563200,3,457,4.518072289156627
512772,5,6302798485,"She does it all in this film. Singing,acting,and falling in love all with quips to spare. One of my favorite Mae West films and certainly most memorable. Mae West will NEVER be forgotten.",1361145600,2,187,4.696969696969697
512773,5,6302798485,"A Mae West movie worth seeing, but why on earth she decides to end up with the guy she does is beyond me.  Although in true Mae West fashion, he may only be the man of this hour, who knows about the next....",1356566400,,207,3.813953488372093
512774,5,6302798485,Story about a strong independent woman in a time where these things were not considered a good thing. I find Mae West movies timeless. Enjoy!,1353628800,,141,4.68
512775,3,6302798485,"The censors were well and truly in force when Mae West set forth on her 1936 movie KLONDIKE ANNIE, which was again based on earlier material written by the star. It doesn't have the sharp edge of earlier films like ""I'm No Angel"", but West acquits herself well as a cabaret star on the run from the law.

The story opens in San Francisco, where Rose Carlton (Mae West) is Chinatown's famed 'Frisco Doll'. Suffocating under the controlling thumb of her lover Chan Lo (Harold Huber), Rose plans to escape to Alaska in order to stake her claim in Nome's booming gold rush. Half-way through the sea voyage, it becomes ""necessary"" for Rose to assume the identity of Sister Annie Alden (Helen Jerome Eddy) who passed away shortly after boarding. Once in Nome, Rose reinvents her life and turns Nome's struggling missionary around, yet everything is threatened when Chan Lo's henchmen track her down...

Co-starring Victor McLaglen as the salty old seadog captain in love with Rose, KLONDIKE ANNIE was a big hit for Mae West, though the watered down script undercuts her impact somewhat. West sings ""My Medicine Man"", ""I'm an Occidental Woman in an Oriental Mood for Love"", ""Mister Deep Blue Sea"", and ""Little Bar Butterfly"".

A fun movie for West fans.",1291161600,2,1246,4.813084112149533

512777,5,6302798485,"Apparently Mae West had to tone it down for this movie due to increased Hollywood censorship.

I'm amazed that Mae West helped write the script, sang and acted in this movie - in 1936!  Surely Mae was ahead of time.

It's a nice little tale with an ""adult"" undertone to it - so it works as a classic for me. So few movies that manage to keep an adult tone during that period.

This movie is hard to get hold of so grab one if you can.",1257206400,,434,3.954022988505747

7831306,5,6302798485,"For some reason I just adore watching Mae West in Klondike Annie.  The beginning is so unusual, that it draws the viewer in with her circumstances as a mistress to a jealous Chinese club owner.  Her wit and delivery is as good as ever in this film and the time in the Yukon is entertaining too.

This is a must for any Mae West fan, and a treat for me, even as a recent fan and discoverer of her talent.",1443139200,,403,4.0125

Despite its unevenness, ""Klondike Annie"" (1936) has enough Westian moments to make for agreeable viewing. ""I'm an Occidental Woman in an Oriental Mood for Love"" is easily the film's best song.
