8085272,5,B000BCKM64,"The Bears and their Easter Surprise is just as I remember it from my youth--a real nostalgic treat!  I'm still not used to the name change from Berenstein to ""Berenstain"", though, especially when I see it on a classic title like this one.

It's almost like having a ""stain"" on my memory, if you'll forgive the pun!  Nothing has been the same since Jan died and the publishers reverted the name to remove any trace of Jewish ancestry.  Still, it's a great family video, and one I would highly recommend to anyone.",1412985600,3,512,4.532608695652174
8085273,5,B000BCKM64,"I was one of those kids growing up that had holiday shows on a recorded vhs and would watch them not only during that holiday, but also randomly throughout the year. I have been on a mission for the past 2 years to collect those shows I enjoyed, whether they be on dvd or only have them on vhs. I wish more were on dvd, but beggers can't be choosers!",1299542400,,350,4.014285714285714
8085274,5,B000BCKM64,"The video was in okay condition, but that's what I expected for an old VHS..I was looking for this movie for my kids, they loved it just like I did when i was their age!",1270252800,,169,3.857142857142857
8085275,5,B000BCKM64,"The video on this page is the authentic special of the Berenstain Bears' Easter Surprise, an animated holiday special. Be sure to get the copy of the video that says Embassy Entertainment, it may be listed separately as the tape still works well after many years. The copy of the video on this page is by the cheaper Good Times entertainment and the quality of the tape is poor with tracking issues.
The story itself is very entertaining with high quality animation. Boss Bunny is in charge of Spring, and is frustrated enough to quit. Poppa Bear decides to build an Easter egg machine with disastrous results. Lots of neat Easter surprises in this fun tape.",1266969600,,658,4.681034482758621
