3445973,5,B001A7X0ZE,"This is one of my favorite movies. It takes more of a psychological aspect than most other vampire movies, nothing to do with sparkly vampires or the brutally violent vamp movies that todays market caters to.",1295654400,,208,4.805555555555555
3445974,1,B001A7X0ZE,"Vampire Diary (Mark James and Phil O'Shea, 2007)

What a good movie this could have been (unlike the other two flicks I had the misfortune to watch the same day), and yet what a bad movie it turned out to be. I gave it a marginally higher rating than When Good Ghouls Go Bad and Troglodyte in the sense that this is the kinda-hot chick who surrounds herself with ugly girls in order to bolster her own charms, but don't be fooled; this is still an awful, awful piece of work.

Vampire Diary concerns Holly (Without You's Morven Macbeth in her screen debut), a documentary filmmaker who is making a feature about ""weekend vampires"", fringe-dwellers in the goth scene who enjoy dressing up in plastic fangs and going clubbing. She's fallen in with a group of them as she's been working, and has gotten somewhat friendly with the core, comprised of Adam (The Tudors' Jamie Thomas King), Haze (The Journey Home's Kate Sissons), and Brad (Miss Potter's Justin McDonald), a group presided over by a rave DJ named Eddie Strode (Seed of Chucky's Keith-Lee Castle). Things are going along all well and good until a new girl, Vicki (Hellboy II's Anna Walton) shows up at a party one night. Holly finds herself drawn to Vicki, and before long the two of them are in a relationship. It is at this point that Vicki tells Holly that she (she being Vicki) is actually a real vampire, not one of these goth-raver-dressup kids. At some point it's also revealed that she's pregnant by another vampire. At this point, you can pretty much substitute a plot summary for the second half of The Possession of Joel Delaney, so I'll stop trying to explain this.

The one good thing about the film is that Walton, Sissons, and Macbeth are all quite attractive. None of them is a terribly good actor, but you get what you pay for. Of the batch, in fact, only King is all that good an actor, and his performance tends to be dragged down by what's happening around him most of the time. Or at least what you can glean of what's happening. The film is shot as if it were all footage Holly had taken (she has cameras scattered throughout her house, etc.); while this device can be, and has been, used to excellent effect in a number of horror films ([REC] and Paranormal Activity are obvious examples), Vampire Diary attempts to use it in something that, when it comes right down to it, isn't a horror film. And here is where the movie completely falls apart. At its heart, Vampire Diary seems as if it was supposed to have been a sort of lesbian Twilight, though one where you're never sure if the vampire actually is a vampire. But James and O'Shea, working from O'Shea's original script, don't want to just make another quirky human-vampire love story, so they attempt to make a horror movie out of it without actually bringing any horror to the table. There's also, briefly, a mystery angle that is entirely without suspense. The pace reminds me of indie art-house drama, though you've gotta be really, really good to make a movie with this kind of pace and still entertain an audience. James and O'Shea will not be confused for Bela Tarr anytime soon. As you may be able to gather from those last few sentences, Vampire Diary is ultimately a movie that has no idea what it wants to be, and that is its greatest, though by no means its only, failure. *",1268697600,6,3325,4.538333333333333

3445976,5,B001A7X0ZE,"This movie turned out to be pretty good.  It's a horror film about a woman who is doing a documentary about Goths, whom she calls the 'weekend vamps', and ends up getting involved in a lesbian relationship with a real vampire.  I thought this movie was really good.  It was also nice to see all the cool Goth characters and to have actual Goth music in the movie from bands like Fields of the Nephilim, Ghost of Lemora, Voices of Masada, Scary Bitches and NFD.",1226793600,14,460,4.3882352941176475
3445977,3,B001A7X0ZE,"If you're looking for some gore, and frightening images, then this isn't the movie. You don't see her fangs and nor do you suspect shes pregnant.
Exotic lesbien scenes,The real vampire named Vicky, who's pregnant,hunting for blood. Betrayle,love who hangs with Holly and her wanna be vampire friends. No one is safe, and the wana be's start dying. Point I didn't get at all. Vicky gets captured and her baby stays with Holly.
I give this movie 2 1/2 stars; But since there's no 2 1/2 stars; 3 will have to do.
But like i said watch it for yourself and then decide.",1224374400,,564,4.485436893203883
3445978,1,B001A7X0ZE,I only watched about 75% of this movie. The best scenes in this movie were all before the two main characters started having spoken dialog. I lost interest once Vicki the Vampire revealed her secret of being a Vampire. It wasn't a believable performance and was reminiscent of a drunken live action gamer fallen into their own fantasy at 3 AM at a coffee shop...,1223078400,2,362,4.584615384615384
3445979,3,B001A7X0ZE,"I didn't know what to expect when I plopped the dvd into my player. I'm very cautious of horror that comes from the independent circuit since there's a lower caliber of directing and acting involved within these films. However, this is definitely not the case here.

About halfway into the film, good memories of Nadja and Martin began to surface in my mind, which is fine by me since I enjoyed both movies, especially Nadja. The use of a handheld camera as the means in which the viewer sees events unfold in the story is not new, but the way directors James and O'Shea manage to execute it seemed fresh to me.

Admittedly, being a typical guy who doesn't think of himself as too typical, I found that the romantic relationship that formed between Vicki (the vampire) and Holly worked out really well and helped carry the story to its twisted end.

If you like independent horror movies such as Nadja, The Addiction, and Martin, then I'd say go for it. This movie may not be to everyone's liking but it's at least worth a rental and a little patience on your part.

The quality of the film itself was good with a fine level of grain intentionally added to set up the atmosphere. There were no digital imperfections from what I could tell.",1221177600,25,1239,4.517857142857143
3445980,4,B001A7X0ZE,"The story is pretty cool, the acting is not bad, the girls are hot in a goth kinda way, BUT the grainy filming is bad. I know it was made that way, but it's not done right. Some spots are a lot more grainy then others, some in and out of focus and bad colors, and some parts that are supposed to be being filmed by the actors are nice and clear. Would have been a great movie with a better Director. Don't pay more than $5 for it. And by the way, the hot babe on the cover is not in the movie.",1424131200,,493,3.75
3445981,5,B001A7X0ZE,Fantastic documentary style movie. Real enough to hook the secret reality junkie inside and enough of the SciFi aspect to make you want it to be true.,1421625600,,150,4.592592592592593

3445994,5,B001A7X0ZE,"Vampire Diary is a great movie considering what it is--the story of a group of 'weekend vampires' and a woman with a habit of recording everything who meet a female vampire by pure chance. Prepare for an unexpected love quadrangle, some interesting lore on vampires, and great use of found footage.

My only complaint lies in a scene towards the end during which one of the weekend vampires' lines were corny (writing) and poorly delivered (acting).
The only moment found footage was in any way awfully used was during a scene at the end. Though it is understandable why shakey cam was used, a great camera angle could have easily taken its place. This is a complete fail on the director's part as far as I'm concerned.

One thing I especially like about Vampire Diary is that the first thirty minutes make a wonderful short story. I almost wished it ended at the water scene simply because of how great the movie was by that point. So, there you go. Give the first thirty minutes a shot. If you find yourself caring about the characters or interested in seeing what happens next, continue on for the remaining hour.

On a side note, I really like the movie poster used for the Amazon Instant Video page.",1404000000,4,1204,4.590697674418605

3445996,4,B001A7X0ZE,"I was really surprised by this British indie film. I expected a cheap, schlocky, exploitative vampire movie, and instead got an interesting, creative, thought provoking chamber drama. Don't get me wrong, this film is not without its flaws, but given its low budget, ultra cliched genre (vampires), and sometimes hackneyed camera work (probably due to budget constraints) it still presents an interesting spin on vampires, and tells a more believable love story than films with 10X the budget(Twilight?!). Lead actress Anna Walton is great in this, tragic,melancholic,ferocious, and haunting, I don't know why she doesn't have a bigger career. Don't believe all the negative reviews, if you enjoy moody, thought provoking indies over big budget schlock fests, check ""Vampire Diary"" out, its going to be a cult classic someday.",1384473600,7,825,5.403100775193798
