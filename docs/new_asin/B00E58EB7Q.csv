Tina Chen, as the mother, is wickedly nasty, and from personal experience, very believable.",1464825600,,281,4.62

8601347,5,B00E58EB7Q,"A film written and directed by a friend, so I have to give it the obligatory 5 stars in show of support =)  That said, Kelly Hu is amazingly beautiful, and the entire ensemble cast lend their talents to a very artistic, soul-searching drama centered around complicated, mixed-cultural family and love relationships.  It's definitely not your typical romance drama.  And, in some ways it raises more questions than it answers.  But, isn't that how life is sometimes?",1412467200,,465,5.0
8601348,5,B00E58EB7Q,"Not your perfect Cinderella story like my Kdramas.  But this Chinese actress was smart, funny, lovely & likable.  I enjoyed watching her & her family muddle through.  Seller was great.",1408579200,2,184,5.066666666666666
8601349,4,B00E58EB7Q,"I heard about this movie in one of Kelly Hu's interviews, and was pleasantly surprised with the movie.  Although it's not your typical fast-paced romantic comedy, there was a natural pacing to the story that felt real.  Character development was executed superbly, where each character, including the main leads had their flaws and imperfections.  In not depicting the male lead as absolutely perfect, the characters felt genuine, dynamic, and human.  Kelly Hu and Ivan Shaw have great chemistry on screen, and the family dysfunction around their characters only adds to the drama.  I definitely had my share of laughs and crying.  Overall, great movie!",1407024000,3,653,5.230769230769231

8601351,4,B00E58EB7Q,"this is an interesting indie picture that has it's good parts. the focus on the interracial family and the impact, culturally on the kids makes this a unique story.",1396224000,,164,4.689655172413793
8601352,4,B00E58EB7Q,"Not quite, Tennessee Williams or Theodore Dreiser but a very appealing dish of Americana. However, most of us are not that seriously-minded and we come to romantic comedies with lower expectations. Those who want to learn from the mistakes of others, search for romantic inspiration, watch appealing characters find their way beyond family bonds, or expectations and remain true to themselves are in for a treat. This film has the most appealing cast without the Disney seal of approval I have ever seen. Kelly Hu does a wonderful job anchoring this drama, supported by the handsome, Ivan Shaw; for the family cad, Edison Chen fills the bill. The parents in this yarn are atypical to mainstream America, both professional academics, (Rees, and the unforgettable Tina Chen of ""3 Days of the Condor,"" co-worker to Robert Redford's character) probably liberal democrats living an upper class lifestyle that has measurably trickled down to their two rival daughters but not the son. There are many things to admire in this mellow-romantic comedy. What I like about it is the fact that from the start it shows you imperfect individuals who suffer the pain of time, regret the losses, celebrate the successes who lay their cards on the table honestly and look inward, go back to the family to heal themselves and then move forward. It's a human battle being waged in America that strains or strengthens traditions and this is a brief look at the front lines of the daily struggle.",1390176000,2,1474,4.94758064516129
