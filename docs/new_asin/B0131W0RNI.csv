8726899,4,B0131W0RNI,"a wonderful rendition of Dvorak's Symphony 8 & 9. Karajan, I believe Herbert von Karajan was at the height of his career when these recordings were made. He is full of expression which certainly infected the orchester in every way. Of course the Wiener Philharmoniker is a world class orchestra anyway. The re-mastering is done extremely well. A word of caution however is in order. Unless you have a ""region free"" DVD player (we have had one for many years) you probably will not be able to play this DVD. My advice, buy one from Amazon (or another reputable company) and enjoy the whole world of DVD's. The ""industry"" in North-America is ripping us off for intentionally blocking any region other N.A. European DVD players are all region free!!!",1486598400,,747,4.7984496124031
