8121044,3,B000FDFNMM,"I always like the AJ instruction. It was a good review but I saw most of it in AJ reveals the truths about golf,so if you have this series don't get it.",1357948800,,152,3.78125
8121045,5,B000FDFNMM,"I've been playing golf for 40 years and found this DVD very insightful.  A previous review of not being ""insiteful"" must have missed the point.  You can read books, watch endless videos, and listen to your friend's advice but Bonar comes the closest to making you a better golfer FASTER.  Just the tips for hitting out of sand make the purchase worthwhile.",1242000000,,356,4.709677419354839
8121046,1,B000FDFNMM,Don't bother it is the same skills in any of his dvd's nothing new or inciteful here.,1231200000,3,85,4.0588235294117645
