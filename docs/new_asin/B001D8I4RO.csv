8292241,5,B001D8I4RO,I'm a beginner with kettle bells but it didn't matter. This guy shows you perfect technique. Emphasis on breathing properly and mastering motions. Awesome,1416096000,,154,5.458333333333333
8292242,5,B001D8I4RO,"I just started doing kettlebells so i needed to learn proper form so i wrote Steve Maxwell and he recommeneded me to start with this DVD (since he is the master of kettlebell) I thought it was pretty good since he teaches you step by step the proper way to do it and doesnt go terrible fast like other dvds. ""Doesnt go terrible fast"" does NOT mean its not challenging!!! this is the way to start if you are new to kettlebell",1374624000,2,424,4.182926829268292
8292243,5,B001D8I4RO,"You receive a 2-disc dvd set. The 1st dvd explains the form and technique. Steve explains the method really well. The 2nd dvd is
the workout, you can follow him along as he does the actual workout with you. The workout is tough.

I bought this DVD by Steve Maxwell based on the recommendation of Joe Rogan on his ""Joe Rogan Experience Podcast"". I met Joe at a comedy club and he really is fit, so I trusted his recommendation.",1350000000,,426,4.325
8292244,5,B001D8I4RO,"Bought this based on what the reviews indicated and found myself really enjoying this work out. Doesn't seem that challenging but when you try to keep up with the instructor, the body can really get to sweating depending on your fitness level and the weight you are using.

I am currently recovering from a shoulder surgery not related to this workout, but am looking forward to getting back into the routine of this workout once I am all healed up.",1334188800,,449,4.6125
8292245,5,B001D8I4RO,"This is the best weight/kettlebell workout I have ever had.  It is not for beginners though.  Having this DVD and a kettlebell has made gym memberships obselete for me.  In about a half hour or less you take care of strength, cardio, and flexibilty training.  I am 37 and am feeling more like 27.

The only downfalls are that you have to run the whole workout DVD to find out how many reps per exercise and he does not tell you how often to perform this workout.  So far I have done it 3 times a week and it seems to get a little easier each time.

I thought Pavel was the Man, but after getting this DVD, Steve Maxwell is way beyond him.",1305504000,3,638,4.096774193548387
8292246,5,B001D8I4RO,"This is a great combination of strength training and cardio mixed into a workout that can be done in less the 30 minutes.  Steve does an excellent job of explaining every exercise and then if you are ready, he will take you through the 300 CHALLENGE!  It is hard to get motivated to go to the gym and workout for and hour or get on the treadmill and run, but I can always seem to find motivation to do the 300 Challenge!  I have done about 8 different KB videos and this is by far my favorite.",1263081600,14,493,4.061855670103093
8292247,5,B001D8I4RO,"Steve Maxwell's ""300 Kettlebell Challenge"" includes 2 DVDs: 1) Challenge Exercises, 2) The 300 Workout.
1) Steve is a strong natural athlete: he could be a Spartan warrior ! He explains the 18 kettlebell exercises very well. It is readily evident that is is an expert. Being kb exercises execution form very important, Steve provides detailed explanations.
2) Steve does the sequence of the 18 exercises. He uses always the same kettlebell(53 lbs at least). With this big weight he does many reps of Windmill,Deck Squat, Reverse Turkish Get-Up. I began using kettlebells
3 months ago and I did this workout using a 26.5 lbs kettlebell except the 3 exercises I mentioned before where I used a small weight. Moreover at this stage I'm not able to perform the Deck Squat while the form of Windmill and TGU is poor. Summarizing to perform this workout at best you should be intermediate/advanced.
Great job Mr Maxwell: I give 5 full stars !",1231632000,15,936,4.819875776397516
