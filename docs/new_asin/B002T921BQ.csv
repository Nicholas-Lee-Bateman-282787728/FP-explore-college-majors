I especially enjoyed the Spike Jonze animations and live action pieces. One technical note: Another reviewer said that some of the videos did not play for him. I found that all played fine for me on two different players.",1425772800,,330,4.910714285714286
8379977,4,B002T921BQ,"So, if you've seen any of the other Wholphins, you know the short film on here can be cool, funny, touching, some disturbing, and I'm proud to say I own all of the volumes (1-13).  Here's how #9 stands out: three of the shorts didn't play on my main DVD player, and the same three wouldn't play on my best friends DVD player, and it's a shame because the Maurice Sendack stuff is a highlight on Volume 9.  At first, I returned the DVD, thinking it was just my copy.  Eventually, I picked up another, and the same three shorts still gave me trouble, only playing on my secondary DVD player.  Oh well, I've decided to live with it.",1304899200,,629,4.260504201680672
