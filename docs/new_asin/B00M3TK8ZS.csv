6554832,1,B00M3TK8ZS,"I'll be honest I rarely write reviews, to sum this up quickly this is an amazing series, however the dubbed audio butchers it, they don't only mess up the translation but in doing so they change all the characters personalities and interactions. It's AWFUL. If you're getting it for the subtitles it's great though.",1415232000,6,315,4.851851851851852
6554833,5,B00M3TK8ZS,"I watched this series on my Crunchyroll account about a few months ago.  LOVED IT!  I thought it was great----season one was about 24-25 episodes I think?  I planned on owning it until I saw what they are charging.

HOWEVER-----I will be passing on this season one set.  $60 for 13 episodes (half season one)?  That would then be about $120 for the whole season one when part two arrives.  Good-bye collecting anime sets on DVD for me when they are priced like this.  Yes I would pay $60 for the season one on blu ray, but not for half the season.  At least when I bought Attack on Titan the blu ray part one was $29.99----Fair in my mind.  Meaning I would get the whole season one for $60, I'll take it this time.

And this is why I have been winding down from buying anime, everyone.  I don't know about you guys but I can LIVE without owning most of the series I see.  If I just watch them once on Crunchyroll I'm good.  So I want to say thank you for the prices these companies are charging, you've made me buy way less anime then I would have and you're making my $6.95 a month crunchyroll membership an amazing deal.

Especially with all the great console games coming out and the new book releases I have on my wishlist, my anime buying has dropped by about 90 percent this year.  And will not likely see many new purchases as you price me out.  So I wish the anime producers alot of luck in making a living in the anime industry, you'll have less of my dollars to do it with.

And to everyone reading this, you should for sure watch this series on Crunchyroll, it is amazing.  And if you can get a FAIR price on the series, snatch it up!  But at $60 per 13 episodes?  Well I guess if you've got money to burn you could, so its up to you.  But I did enjoy this series, not enough to burn my money on it though LOL.

And if me voting with my money by not buying means there may be less new anime to watch, well then so be it.  I'll always have books and graphic novels to follow along with.  Charge a fair price or else count me out in standing in line for your product.",1412294400,5,2076,4.091811414392059
6554834,4,B00M3TK8ZS,"Collage student Shiroe wakes up one day to find he and 30,000 others have been trapped in the fantasy RPG Elder Tales. At first people simply try to make do, basically just continuing to play the game. But pretty soon it is evident that their predicament isn't temporary and that in order to live in this new world they are going to have to build a functioning society. Throw in the discovery that the NPCs appear to have free will and that dying has unexpected consequences and things become even more complicated.

Log Horizon started airing about a year after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sword-Art-Online/dp/B00DK2HJAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sword Art Online</a>&nbsp;finished airing. Both feature gamers trapped in a VMMOPG, but I was surprised to find they were quite different. With death in SAO being permanent, the characters tend to spend a lot of time worrying about death (their own or others). In Log Horizon when a character dies they simply reappear at the chapel. They feel hunger, but don't really need to eat. So their worries are more about how to survive happily and harmoniously. This leads to the one thing that really got me hooked on the series - they form a government. It is lots of fun to watch how Shiroe manages to force the creation of a city council.

The characters are in general are pretty fun and I only particularly disliked one. Shiroe turned out to be a really fun character with surprising foresight and clever ideas. One of the best things about him is that his intelligence isn't thrown in your face at the beginning. Not that he isn't introduced as being smart, but the show doesn't try to force you to admire him without working for it. It takes time and witnessing his schemes to really appreciate the way he thinks things through. In addition to Shiroe, there were actually several other characters that surprised me with their development.

It took me about 5-6 episodes to really warm to this series. That is how long it took to set up the plot and introduce the characters, then it dives right in to the cool stuff and keeps it up to the end. There is a second season scheduled to start airing 10/05/14. Note that this set is only the first half of the first season.",1412035200,10,2264,4.875324675324675
6554835,5,B00M3TK8ZS,"While it has some similarities to other anime such as Sword Art Online in the sense that players are trapped in an online game, this show is vastly different. Whereas Kirito in SAO, along with the other players, want to get out of the game, Shiroe and the others in Log Horizon attempt to live their lives out in the new world they find themselves trapped in.

I really liked that part, because it takes this show in a different direction than SAO, and sometimes even pokes fun at the former game. They try to deal with living in the game world of Elder Tale, such as dealing with the rampant player-killing several players were doing out of sheer boredom, and later having them deal with the NPC's (non-player character, or characters controlled by the game itself), who viewed the players with a cautious sense of optimism. While players were powerful, they could also abuse the NPC's, and unlike players who resurrect after dying, NPC's who die stay dead, hence their skepticism.

Overall this show was really interesting to watch. I watched it online at crunchyroll, and will certainly get this when it comes out on bluray.

I only have two main complaints. The first is that due to the sheer amount of characters, many of them get sidelined or very little development, so you don't get to know them very well. The second is that the show starts to peter out towards the end, as the most interesting things happen around halfway to about 3/4th's of the way through the show. The ending very obviously sets itself up for season 2 which will air in the Fall 2014 anime season in Japan, with Shiroe meeting an old acquaintance who will likely be a major antagonist towards his goals.",1409270400,22,1684,4.625418060200669
6554836,5,B00M3TK8ZS,"This series is, in many ways, the result of someone knowing how to approach trapped in a game. The creator has the advantage of having written Maoyuu, which used tabletop gaming rules for its world and was an entertaining lesson on Medieval social dynamics, politics, and economics. That experience comes in play here.

The characters, Shiroe, Naotsugu, Akatsuki and others fall into a class of characters known as adventurers. The reason for this, is until the start of the show, they were MMO gamers of the fictional, but wildly popular MMO called Elder Tale, which is set in a post-post-apocalyptic Earth (there have been a few) thousands of years in the future, that was set up to be half the size of the real one. The name of which is a portmanteau of The Elder Scrolls and The Bard's Tale (which are clearly games the original creator played). It serves as the in-universe equivalent of Everquest/Ragnarok Online, and other popular MMOs that were popular in the late 90s and early 00s, and has been around for 20 years in-universe.

Well, to the adventurers who were on when a key expansion came about.... it's no longer a game.

Unlike your usual trapped in another world anime, book, comic series, there is no known way home. At least for right now, and one of the underlying metaplots for the series as a whole (which includes the Light Novels), is finding out if there is one. Rather than focus on the players learning how to play a game that is suddenly reality, though that is there. Instead, the series largely concentrates on how they work to make their lives better, and how their using 21st century knowledge affects the wider world. The game mechanics are still there, but some have now changed from how they were in game in surprising ways. Some get revealed early, some don't get revealed until later, though they are hinted at in the first season.

When I first watched it on Crynchyroll, I found it to be better than SAO in many ways, largely due to the fact that Mamare Touno did excellent worldbuilding for the anime to draw from, and it clearly explains the internal mechanics of the world it lives in. If SAO was a Hero's Journey, then Log Horizon is about how the heroes do affect the world around them, often in unpredictable ways.",1486339200,,2258,4.651629072681704
6554837,5,B00M3TK8ZS,"As usual, it's a gamble as to whether I'm going to like a dubbed show I've seen as a sub, but I have to say, I rather enjoyed the voices they've chosen so far.  Nyanta's voice surprised me, but I have to say I enjoy him the most.

As for the show itself, it's in a genre that's seen a lot of play - the ""Trapped in a Game World"" one - lately, but it's definitely something different from others you might have seen.  I'm not sure whether I enjoy this or Overlord more.  But that's not a bad thing, as both are just simply great.",1483056000,,528,3.952830188679245

6554839,5,B00M3TK8ZS,"Because I'm not in the habit of reviewing individual volumes of anime, I will review the entire first season here and I'll try not to spoil too much.

This is one of those anime about being trapped in a MMORPG. This is becoming a genre onto itself with the amount of these kind of anime. I only saw just one of these anime before: the hack sign anime.  While that anime is boring because it's just jabbering on and on, Log Horizon is filled with action...and, yes, it has a lot of jabbering in it but it's nowhere near as monotonous as hack sign's jabbering.

The main focus of this kind of anime is usually finding a way back to reality but Log Horizon is different in that regard.  Log Horizon has no grand overarching plot.

Shiroe and his friends find themselves in Elder Tales, a MMORPG that had a recent expansion.  According to the players, Elder Tales is twenty years old. I find it hard to believe people are still playing that old of a game but there's people that still play Diablo II.

This stars the usual cast of this kind of anime; Enchanter, Ninja Assassination, Tank and other class types in a MMO.

Shiroe is known as the villain behind glasses because he's much smarter then everyone else.....in most cases.  It was Shiroe that established the Round Table Conference, a governing body of players made by the bigger guilds.  The day that players became trapped in the game is known as The Apocalypse.

The NPCs of the game are real people now with their own lives and backstories. One of these non-player characters (known collectively as ""People of the Land"") inspires to be an adventurer and that was a stroke of genius.

It has no grand overarching plot so it has no great ending.  Season One ends at a narrative stopping point; I call it a ""stopping point"" because it's clearly not an ending and it's not a cliffhanger......although I suppose you could make a very thin argument that it's cliffhanger-ish.

The anime explains the mechanics of MMOs quite well.  Although the players do have access to menus, they perform their moves automatically.

This dub is quite good although the main character sounds too old for the design for Shiroe.",1471046400,,2162,4.605744125326371
6554840,5,B00M3TK8ZS,"In a popular anime and manga subgenre that includes Sword Art Online, Log Horizon stands out because instead of being Yet Another story about how do they escape from a computer game gone insane, this is the story of how do they make their online life better until they figure out how to escape it and go home.  More importantly, as ties binding characters to this world increase along with the time spent there, how many of these gamers would choose to go home rather than stay if they eventually get the chance?

Note: The two seasons of this show have been released on four DVD or Blu-ray sets, with each season split at about the halfway point, episodes 13-14:

Following the Catastrophe, the update that traps them in the game, the characters of Log Horizon distinguish themselves from all of the other such characters in such shows by concentrating on building and improving their world, and it is fairly remarkable when one compares the time spent in battle with the time spent in something else.  In particular in this first half of season 1 a lot more effort is put into Shiroe's plan to manipulate the Round Table into accepting his blackmail and running the city of Akihabara his way than the simple rescue mission to save Serara and return her from Susukino.

Defects?  About the only noticeable one is the overused Harem Plot Device: the main hero, the virginal Shiroe, acquires something approaching half a dozen of ladies in various levels of love for him of which he is totally clueless, and let's not even bring up Soujiro Seto's West Wind Brigade.

My title reference?  Well, I was not much surprised to learn that the previous Manga/Anime for which Mamare Touno was famous for was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-A-O-Y-U/dp/B00IOFDKAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M.A.O.Y.U.</a>, a course on Medieval macroeconomics and geopolitics disguised as a fantasy adventure.

The story is kinda similar to SOA (Sword Art Online) the players find themselves stuck inside a video game unable to logout.  They must adapt to their new environment and move forward to figure out if they can solve the mystery and hopefully get out of the game.  The main character of the anime is very interesting he is what I would call a super nerd or an elite, he can do things other people might find hard or impossible to do. So far their are 2 seasons out(on the net), and hopefully a third will come shortly. Each episode gets me pumped up for the next one.

6554853,5,B00M3TK8ZS,"This show is far superior to Sword Art Online and even the beast that is .Hack in my most humble opinion. I can honestly say that this has solidified itself as my favorite anime. I am a casual RPG player so I can relate to the jokes and references throughout. Very well crafted series with tons of laughs and enough serious moments and fights to keep anyone entertained. The only bad word heard so far was the A-word. I mention it because I like to watch the show with my 11-year old daughter. Besides that small donkey, the show is very family friendly.

6554869,5,B00M3TK8ZS,"I watched this having already seen it in the original Japanese via crunchyroll.  Amazing but still different.
For the English dubs, you get more information about the ""world"" or game of Elder Scrolls.  According to many, the English dubs are closer to the original manga but I really can't say.  There are mild cuss words in the English dubs as well as 21th century American slang words.  In some cases the new dubs are better in explaining things and in other cases it loses (to my opinion) some of the ""magic"" from the original Japanese voices.  Chief Nyanta & Princess Lenessia being the 2 main different dialogues.  Less ""meows"" and more ""street slang"" would be my interpretation.  Also, some of the Japanese language scenes just are better.
The voice actors and actresses (especially the actresses) sound very similar to one another in contrast to the Japanese actors/voices, which provide a very distinct change in who is speaking (sorry, all the females sound the same regardless of the credits).
Specials- in some of the episodes both the beginning & opening sequences with music have full subtitles, be they in English or Japanese.  On disc 1 you can view other products coming from the same company (Sentai).  The ""politeness"" of the Japanese language is lost but then with the English dubs it is much more reduced in the sexual innuendo by Naotsugu & Naotsugu vs. Akutsuki are more like curses/mouthing off to each other versus Akutuski keeping Naotsugu silent on his sexist humor.
This anime is still great & amazing but the English dubs do give it a different flavor that I'm not used to and because of this, I do prefer the original Japanese language despite getting more info in the English dubs.

***
BIG notice here: this DVD/Blu-Ray set has the first 13 episodes with the Log Horizon 2 set delivering the rest of season 1.  If you go to most anime outlets, they'll offer you all these into Parts 1,2,3, etc. with about 3 episodes per set & at the SAME PRICE IF NOT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THIS ONE!!!  Remember, this set has 13 episodes, if you buy the other versions, you're more or less getting 3 episodes per purchase so buy this one if you actually want the show to watch.

6554870,5,B00M3TK8ZS,"I watched this series on Crunchyroll was thoroughly impressed. Many people are quick to compare this and SAO, and while i did enjoy SAO for its own reasons this anime totally BLOWS it out of the water. Well paced and mature throughout with fantastic art episode after episode left me wanting more. I fully admit that I'm a biased fan when i say this, but right now i truly can't find anything bad to say about this movie. As a gamer i appreciate the accuracy and true to form world that they created, and while i can see how it might be overwhelming for someone with no background in MMORPGs, i feel like i can safely say it still handles the knowledge gap in fans very well. Truly a cut above, this is DEFINITELY a must see anime",1417305600,2,730,4.297101449275362
6554871,5,B00M3TK8ZS,"You can still watch this series in Japanese with English subtitles on Crunchyroll and Hulu (I think) for free. So if you want to know whether this series is worth buying, try it out! I've watched the entire first season and am into the second through streaming websites. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SERIES. It's got one of the most addictive and rockin' opening songs I've come across in anime. I love all the characters and the story. (Even though it's in the same genre as Sword Art Online it's not at all like that series.) Whether you'll like it, well, only you can tell, right? But I think it's totally worth it. :)

I got the Bluray release at the pre-order price of $49. I wish it came with the entire first season, but I'm not going to whine about it too much. It's a very well put-together release, nice box and disc art, and even the menu is very well designed. Very nicely done over all!

What about that dub, eh? Well, firstly, the script is spot on. Having watched the entire thing in Japanese, I know very well what the characters SHOULD be saying. The dub stays very true to the original intent of the Japanese script. This is important, because a bad English dub script will ruin even the best voice acting. The characters ""felt the same"" in the English version because of the good scripting.

As for the voice acting, it's... acceptable. What I mean is that the acting itself is usually fine, but the English voices given to certain characters surprised me. They weren't really bad, so much as different. The two most jarring were Naotsugu and Nyanta. Naotsugu sounded too gravely for the character (but the actual acting was very in-character) and Nyanta... well... ok, Nyanta is VERY DIFFERENT. I know there will be people that HATE the voice acting that Sentai got for Nyanta... but... gosh, it was just so unexpected that I gave in and ended up liking it for it's uniqueness.

Possibly the best voice match was Akatsuki. Saxton's voice matches almost perfectly with Kato (the Japanese voice actress). Sentai did an unbelievable job finding someone who sounds just like the Japanese voice. It's actually pretty astonishing (as well as incredibly rare).

All the other voice acting and matching is about average for the current industry. This includes the main character Shiroe. It's not bad, but not great either. Over all, I'm pleased with Sentai's attempt at dubbing this series and am looking forward to seeing the rest of the season completed.

Having said all that, if you hate dubs, you'll hate this dub too. Some people just hate anything that is not the ""original"". If you're such a person, skip the dub completely. It'll only irritate you. For the rest of us who don't have that negative bias, please give the dub a chance! You may be pleasantly surprised!",1417046400,5,2780,4.674846625766871

6554873,5,B00M3TK8ZS,"With the English Dub episodes leaked onto the web, I watched them out of curiosity since I was planning to buy the DVD sets for Log Horizon anyways for the subtitled version. I got one heck of an awesome surprise finding the English dub studio has done one of the best dubs I seen in a long while. Instead of just translating the Japanese dub, the English dub has gone the route of doing a closer translation of the light novel and did one hell of a job considering they managed to tell the story of Log Horizon better than the Japanese dub through just minor editing and voice acting alone. The studio even used the uncanny feeling the new dub gives to get both new watchers and subtitled watchers to work the tone back to the light novel in the beginning and get you right into the story that the Japanese dub missed. Even though several character models have changed, they still within the characters akin to the light novel or have been planned to help English speakers get later one story points better than keeping the Japanese anime character models. In fact, I will not be surprised if the English dub gets Japanese subtitles for Japanese light novel fans and anime only watchers as the Japanese dub of Log Horizon has a lot of spin-off references that confused many fans who have not looked into them and the English dub removed a lot of it and put cleaner lines that really keeps you in the story compared to the original anime. This is one anime where I can say both the Japanese dub and English dub actually compliment each other instead of one is better than the other. The Japanese dub is more light hearted and gives out lots of goodies for fans of the overall Log Horizon series including the spin-offs. The English dub on the other hand takes more of the darker tones of the series and give light novel fans the very story of being lost in a brand new world with no laws and morals and finding how to live in such a familiar, but different world they know of. Hence even with this DVD set being a bit higher in price for half a season, I am buying it as I know where that extra cost comes from and it was well worth it.",1415836800,30,2136,4.329177057356609
6554874,4,B00M3TK8ZS,"The show is good,(<<my opinion) basically Sword Art Online except focuses more on the GAMERS of MMO's instead of a Love story which is the case in SAO.
If you are a gamer or generally like anime I think its a great watch with a great story.
Also other reviews that are 20 lines long seem fake cuz no one would write that much unless they get paid",1415664000,,346,4.102941176470588
6554875,4,B00M3TK8ZS,"This anime, best described, is a slow version of Sword Art Online and that is NOT a bad thing. They're trapped in a virtual game with no way of escape and I know what you're thinking: It's been done before YAWN"" Actually...not like this. In Sword Art Online, the characters know what has happened and know that even though it's a game? it's also life and death. In Log Horizon? more emphasis is placed on living in this world and building your own society. It's not as heavy on the action like Sword Art but it does ask and try to answer questions about what would happen if you were stuck in a video game with no explanation. It's a nice drama and actually feels more like an RPG.

Pros:
Asks the right questions
Poses an interesting situation for gamers
RPG elements
Nice animation

Cons:
Very slow at times
Not as action heavy as i would've liked
Too much focus on the beauty of one female character (shes not the hottest in the show but they act like she is)\

The best way to describe it is: If Sword Art Online is Coke? this is the diet version and that's okay. It has more drama and goes into more depth about the world, characters, classes, NPCs, etc.. Definitely something to check out. The english voices are...okay? I've heard worse so don't mind the 1 star reviews about the voices. If you're getting the DVD you can just change it...duh. Overall: Good anime, definitely worth you checking it out BUT....50 dollars on amazon? as of 11/7/2014 its 50 dollars for 13 episodes? Kind of high. Wait for a reduction.",1415318400,4,1521,4.4640287769784175
