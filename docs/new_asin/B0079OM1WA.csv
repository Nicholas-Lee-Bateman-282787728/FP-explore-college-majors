8512949,5,B0079OM1WA,"My family had a great time viewing the DVD set.  We are always looking for ways to teach our kids to be creative and make things.  This was a terrific way to get them involved into making something simple and fun. On Cruise Ship Towel Folding the host goes over each towel origami creation in great detail and the creations look wonderful once we are done making them. From beginning towel origami creations to advanced works of art, they are all here on these DVDs. My 5 year old loves watching the tutorials and makes some pretty cool things. His favorite one is the elephant. The towel creations also make our guest rooms look pretty cool.  If you want to entertain your children or want to impress a house guest, get these DVDs.",1365033600,,732,4.488721804511278
