8267912,5,B0017ZM0NW,"As far as I know, these performances have not been previously released in the USA. They are danced by Nadzedah Pavlova with the Moscow City Ballet. It is hard to determine when these ballets were performed, since the date of 2005 could be just the release date, but Pavlova is still dancing as of this writing. The performances are videos taken on tour and are somewhat low budget, but the costumes and music are certainly up to snuff. Certainly, the price is exceptional for three DVDs. There is one big drawback: the format, while region free, is PAL, not NTSC(the formant used in the USA), so your DVD player may not play it. But you should be able to play it on your computer. Certainly VLC Media Player(free to download) plays it just fine. Another drawback is the old 4:3 aspect ratio, but at least the image and sound are pretty good. This set is recommended for those interested in classical ballet esoterica.",1402272000,,917,4.631901840490798
