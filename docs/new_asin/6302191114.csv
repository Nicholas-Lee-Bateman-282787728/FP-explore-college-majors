444829,2,6302191114,"Albert Pyun is my absolute least favorite director. I hate his guts. His direction ruined ""Cyborg"" and was murky in ""Omega Doom."" This is his best flick, and it's not that good. In fact, it pales in comparison to the so-so original. Sasha Mitchell is highly entertaining in this sequel that is certainly watchable, but highly forgettable. The villain from the first, Tong Po, has returned after killing the Sloan brothers from the first movie. Now, he's out to redeem his honor by fighting little brother David Sloan. Standard martial arts fare. Some choppy fight scenes, but an interesting main character saves this picture from otherwise becoming complete dreck.",1031961600,,664,5.10091743119266

This time Sasha Mitchell is David Sloan and is here to fight for revenge in a bloody kickboxing battle. This movie delivers a lot of heart and action. The best Kickboxer in the series and the best movie ever made. They should release this on DVD in english, it's well worth it, especially when there's movies that aren't very good released on DVD. Why can't they release this on DVD in english, because it's released in French and German, and I went so far as to buy the French version, even though I can't understand French.

444852,1,6302191114,"Mitchell just had no skills or ability of a real fighter, so Xien Chow--the consummate trainer--had no real purpose being in this movie. Here're some directions the movie should have taken: they could have offered the title role to Mitchell's prize student or had a major try-out for a person to be either the guys' cousin or friend(that way, the best that they could afford gets the job), they could have offered the title role to Philip Rhee, Seagal, or Bruce Lee's son(Brandon), who was still living when this movie was made and made this person(whoever they chose) to be the brothers' cousin or friend bent on revenge. From the looks of the movie, the first option would have been best(very low budget). They needed to write a new fighting villain into the movie, as Tong Po looked like he wasn't in shape and his heart wasn't in it(they could have used ""TShang Tsung""--sorry don't know his real name--and some henchmen to kill David's brothers and his in-law; and, instead of Tshang Tsung championinging Tong Po, they should have subbed in another fighter. This movie needs a starting point(this movie doesn't get that right; he should have been a cousin or friend), a defribillating overhaul, and new directors/writers. The director and/or writer(s) seemed unresponsive and almost as if they weren't going to change anything that might make the movie better(almost as if they were just plain lazy or on an unreasonable schedule for making a good movie). Really the only good that I can say about it is that it needs to be improved in every conceivable area. They had a promising character(more gifted the Mitchell), who was tutored by Mitchell and the promoter or Freddie Lee like man(played Tshang Tsung in Mortal Kombat). Like I said in the other post, this movie is unbearably, unbelievably bad; believe the 1 ratings and not the others; they don't know what they are talking about! it's not onion or garlic breath bad; it's fart or excrement breath bad!",1358294400,,1963,4.845238095238095

With two returning cast members from the original film, a script by Hollywood heavyweight David Goyer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Begins/dp/B00005JNJV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Begins</a>), and with the undisputed king of trashy B-movies Albert Pyun (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cyborg/dp/0792835735/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cyborg</a>) in the director's chair, Mitchell managed to remain entertaining for 90 minutes but failed from the get-go to be remembered as fondly as Van Damme is for his exploits. It's a good little kickboxing movie and definitely a better-than-average outing for director Pyun, but fans of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kickboxer/dp/0783114885/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kickboxer</a>, if they so choose, can ignore this spin-off adventure and not miss out anything that wasn't better in the first movie.

The story: following the death of his brother Eric and the murder of his brother Kurt at the hands of the Thai ex-champion Tong Po (Michel Qissi), the last remaining Sloan brother - David (Mitchell,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Step-by-Step/dp/B000EU1QC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Step by Step</a>) -takes over their inner city kickboxing gym and uses it as a haven for troubled youth. Upon turning down offers to reenter the kickboxing circuit by a greedy promoter (Peter Boyle,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Everybody-Loves-Raymond/dp/B000UR9TKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Everybody Loves Raymond</a>) and Tong Po's nefarious manager (Cary Tagawa,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>) looking for a match between the ex-champ and the last remaining Sloan brother, David finds himself losing his best friend (Vince Murdocco,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring-of-Fire/dp/B000094FE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring of Fire</a>) to the circuit and himself in the hospital following an attack on his gym. Debilitatingly wounded, he must accept the help from his late brother's teacher - the wise and comedic Xian Chow (Dennis Chan) - if he hopes to regain his confidence and put an end to the circuit's corruption.

The one major fault that the film bears is that its ending comes way too fast: the film is of average length, but the inevitable confrontation between David and Tong Po comes at the end of what feels like a very short journey and with minimal preparation on David's part. Sure, there's a training montage, but it's nothing as remarkable and meaningful as Van Damme's excursions in the jungle. If you can get over that, though, the movie is pretty entertaining and solidly put-together for a Pyun picture. Both the protagonists and villains happily ham it up without delivering outright bad performances, and do so to the tune of one of the most outspokenly awesome '80s-sounding soundtracks I have ever heard. The sappy situations David finds himself in - whether it's opening his doors to a foul-mouthed homeless kid or teaching ethics to unscrupulous fight promoters - is the stuff that B-movies are made of but are so wholesomely entertaining in their earnest delivery that it's hard not to keep watching.

Indeed, how entertained you are by the rest of the movie will determine whether or not you can forgive the film's fight content. No, it's not bad, but there just isn't a lot of it: not including a clean sparring session between Mitchell and Murdocco and a short montage of the latter, there are only three fights, featuring Mitchell, Murdocco, Tong Po, and B-movie baddie extraordinaire Matthias Hues (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Come-in-Peace/dp/6301885538/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Come in Peace</a>). The quality of the fights (choreographed by Benny 'the Jet' Urquidez) ranges between good and decent, with good cinematography but no real technical know-how and the fact that the two Tong Po encounters are shot almost entirely in slow motion. The final David/Po showdown, despite featuring the former being beaten so bloody that he looks like a zombie, lacks the emotion and back-and-forth action of the original Van Damme fight, so there's a good chance that devotees of the first film will deem this one unfavorable for ending on a technical low note.

However, anybody who was a bit put off by the exoticness of the first film may prefer this one for its close-to-home-ness; by the standards of traditionalists, it's definitely blander, but also a bit more accessible for folks who aren't crazy about Van Damme. Give it a try, action fans.",1259280000,2,5204,6.43

444862,3,6302191114,"""Better than Kickboxer"" raves the L.A. Times!  Well now you know how much stock you can put into a movie review from the L.A. times.
Anyhow, what do you do when you can't lure Van Damme back to do your sequel?  Well, duh! Naturally you go and get Sasha Mitchell.  You also conveniently kill off Van Damme's character(Tong Po was a sore loser and killed him and apparently his brother and Dennis Chan's niece).  In this film, Sasha Mitchell plays the younger brother of Van Damme.  This doesn't make too much sense considering in the first film, Van Damme stated that his older brother(played by Dennis Alexio) was all the family he had.  Anyway, Mitchell runs a martial arts gym that's just on the verge of going under.  Seems that in Thailand they haven't been able to shake off the dishonor of having their best fighter losing to Van Damme, and want to regain it by having villain Tong Po come to America and fight with Mitchell.  By burning down his gym and other scare tactics, they finally get them both in the ring.  Dennis Chan, who trained Van Damme in the first film, is also lured to America to train Mitchell.  My God, who will win??  It's not without it's entertainment value, but it's not terribly good, and some of the scenarios are hard to swallow, even for a cheap action film.  Mitchell doesn't do too bad of a job and actually is a likable guy.  Peter Boyle has a constant look of, ""what the hell am I doing in this movie?"".  And Dennis Chan is just going through the motions, but isn't quite as charming this time around.  Once again, Tong Po is played by white guy in Asian makeup, Michel Quissi, and he seems to have lost some of his menace.  The movie was directed by schlockmeister, Albert Pyun, and that name speaks volumes if you're familiar with it.  The fight scenes are decent, but Pyun has this thing about playing them out almost entirely in slow motion.  Padding out running time perhaps?  All in all the movie painlessly passed the time while I did laundry.  Watch for the King Diamond shirt!",1198886400,,2024,4.493150684931507
444863,4,6302191114,"Kickboxer 2 followed up the first successful Kickboxer, but minus Van Damme.  David Sloan (played by Sasha Mitchell) is now the focus, the apparent 3rd brother of Kurt and Eric Sloan from the 1st movie.  Sasha Mitchell may not be anywhere as close to Van Damme in the athletic department, but that doesn't hurt Kickboxer 2 at all.  Sasha Mitchell is a better actor and as a whole, Kickboxer 2 does a better job than the 1st movie in that department.  The story is pretty decent too - this time both characters (good and evil) are out for revenge.  The evil is Tong Po, who returns from the 1st Kickboxer,  played by Michel Qissi.  He only has one line in the movie and doesn't appear until much later on, but it is a grand appearance.  Matthias Hues (Death Match, Blackbelt, No Retreat No Surrender 2) also has a role in the movie, fighting David early on in the ring, the 1st of 3 fights in the movie.  Vince Murdocco (Ring of Fire, To Be The Best) is also one of the main characters, who fights Tong Po, the 2nd fight in the movie.  This match is all in slow-motion, but it is the only slow motion fight I have ever enjoyed, creating a sense of suspense that supports a main element in the story.  The final fight of course is between David and Tong Po, which is about 5-1/2 minutes in length.  It is mostly slow-motion once again, but is still quite entertaining and bloody, with broken glass glued and taped to the fists (same used in the 1st Kickboxer).

Kickboxer 1 is definetly a Van Damme classic.  Kickboxer 2 began a different path, but in no way did it succeed in being a bad martial-arts film.  I highly recommend this if you want to see some good fights backed by a decent story.",1155859200,,1692,4.343949044585988
444864,4,6302191114,"KICKBOXER 2 has great fighting and action, with a good story. This continues with Sasha Mitchell (Step By Step), as Jean Claude Van Damme's younger brother. Instead of returning, Van Damme went to make the movie 'Double Impact.' Peter Boyle (Everybody Loves Raymond) and Dennis Chan (Kickboxer) are great additions to THE ROAD BACK. The KICKBOXER stories are really raw for the action movies of that time period. Sasha Mitchell probably does his best performance of his career. After enjoying this, continue with KICKBOXER 3 & 4!",1144108800,5,529,5.091954022988506
444865,3,6302191114,"Its hard to believe that some people gave this movie a negative review just because it didn't have Jean Claude Van Damme in it. Sasha Mitchell does a good job in this one. He plays David Sloan, the younger brother of Jean Claude's character who we learn was murdered by former champion Tong Po at the end of the first Kickboxer. The trainer (I don't know his name) from the first Kickboxer comes to help David prepare for his fight with Tong Po. Yes, like the first movie Kicboxer 2 is about avenging the death of a brother and like the first it delivers good martial arts action along with the return of Tong Po. As with the first movie, the Kickboxer 2 dvd has no features and is not widescreen.",1119744000,10,697,4.32824427480916
444866,3,6302191114,"Alot of people think this is better than the original Kickboxer, however, I really don't think so. First of all, I think they probably shouldn't have bothered making a sequel at all without Van Damme. I'm not really sure the exact reason why Van Damme didn't do a sequel, I'm guessing he either wanted too much money to do one, or he just wasn't interested in doing one at all. (Generally, Van Damme was just never really big on sequels.) Perhaps it was a combination of both reasons, who really knows for sure. Either way, I don't think they should have bothered.

It's not that Sasha Mitchell(aka, Cody, the goofy kid from Step by Step) is bad in the lead role...in fact, he was very convincing, given his real-life Kickboxing experience...he just doesn't have the same style or coordination as Van Damme. On top of all that, the thing I find most irritating of all is that the writers felt the need to write in some really bad dialogue to explain what happened to Kurt and Eric Sloane from the previous movie. I was never a huge fan of the whole ""everybody from the past movie are all dead"" thing. By the time they got to Kickboxer 5, it was starting to get really ridiculous with this.

The rest of the cast is a mix...Peter Boyle gave a decent performance, and Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa always gives a top notch performance in anything he is in. Hell, even Matthias Hughes(who plays villains in a variety of B-action movies) gave a decent performance, but some of the other supporting actors left alot to be desired. Whoever the guy was that played McKaia(or is it McKaya?), I forget the name, gave a pretty lousy performance, as did Vince Murdocco(Brian). As for the Tong Po in this version(credited as ""Michel Qissi""), I'm not sure whether or not it is the same Tong Po from the first movie, I don't think he is, as he looks a bit different, but he just seemed really weird in this version.

If they were intent on making a sequel without Van Damme, then they could have at least tried. The movie started out with a goo plot, and solid foundation, however, after the first fight with David and Neil Vargas, the plot starts to jump all over the place. Tong Po and Sanga are introduced into the movie very late, even though they are the entire focus of the story towards the end. On top of less-than-stellar writing and story development, the fight scenes in this one were terrible. The last two fights in the movie were shown ENTIRELY in slow motion. By the end of the last fight between David and Tong Po, I felt like I was going to get vertigo if I watched it any longer. They were really stretching some things, too. I find it hard to believe that the fight would have gone on that long after Tong Po knocked the referee out. Is it a WWE wrestling match or what? Also, what makes even less sense is that David is escorted out of the building by about seven security guards, and then a few moments later he is magically back at ringside just in time to see Brian killed.

As for the soundtrack, this movie had a couple decent songs; ""My Brother's Eyes,"" ""A Man Alone,"" ""It's All up to You,"" however, once again the movie falls short in comparison to the first Kickboxer in this aspect. For those who did enjoy the soundtrack, good luck finding those tracks, as since a Kickboxer 2 soundtrack was never commercially released, those tracks are virtually impossible to get.

Even though I don't necessarily think this movie was great, I think it was at least better than some of the other Kickboxer sequels. It wasn't as bad as the third one(which was probably the worst of the series), and it couldn't possibly be as bad as Kickboxer 4, with plastic-face Tong Po and a plot that made virtually no sense. As for Kickboxer 5(which was ironically a half-remake of Kickboxer 2), it was actually decent, given the talents of Mark Dacascos, and better writers.

All in all I think this was a poor sequel and they shouldn't have bothered.",1094342400,,3932,4.5

This is how the sequel should of been, Kurt escaping to America with Mylee, his brother, Mylee's uncle, and Winston Taylor, and even if Tong Po and his gang would of followed them, they wouldn't be that much of a threat knowing the American government is not corrupt as Thailand.",1459123200,,550,4.612244897959184

It's not even 10mins into the movie and I'm already catching myself yawning. They tried give this film a ""Rocky"" approach where its kind of a fighting drama but fails badly in doing so. One example, the music is over the top in the fight scenes and try really hard to heroic like in the Rocky films only more generic. Sasha Mitchell's acting is so unconvincing and one dimensional. His acting is as good as Chuck Norris, which is plain as corn flakes. The plot of the film is also another let down. How does defeating a younger brother of an prior opponent return your honor as a fighter??? Shang Tsung and Tong Po really seem out of place in this story. The fact that they are seeking to redeem their ""honor"" through a younger Sloan is just stupid. Xian, young Sloan's instructor, doesn't seem to behave like like himself like in the previous film. The only reason why I rank this crap fest one star is because the final fight was the only part that I found entertaining which is a hilarious scene.
