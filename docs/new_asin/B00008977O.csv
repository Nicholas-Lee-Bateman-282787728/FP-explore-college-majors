1831610,5,B00008977O,"First off, simply the fact that a George Strait concert is available on DVD is very exciting.  I enjoyed every song presented here, and George's performance was excellent.  The video quality of the DVD is good, but not excellent.  I think it must have been shot on video, not film.  The 5.1 audio soundtrack is not very good.  It has way too much crowd noise in the soundtrack, and the fronts don't sound very solid.  You don't get a good sense of vocals in front of you.  They sound a little weak, and lacking in upper range detail.  This was remedied by listening to the 2.0 stereo soundtrack, and putting my receiver in stereo mode.  Much more solid vocals, more powerful and rich sounding.  There is a funny little error with the numbering of the songs on the back.  The numbering is correct up to song 5, but after song 5, track 6 is actually President Bush Sr's. presentation, but it is not counted on the back as being a track.  This means to get to the song listed as being song 6, you have to punch in 7 to actually get to it.  I guess it is song 6, but it is not track 6.  Quirky.  If you have not seen the 1980s VHS tape of a George Strait New Year's Eve show, I highly recommend it.  It is at least as enjoyable as this DVD.",1046908800,29,1236,4.151898734177215
1831611,4,B00008977O,"Well, I read this DVD was coming and and I was stoked. George Strait is the ... when it comes to country, and I have read that his shows are pretty amazing. Well, I bought the DVD the first day it came out then rushed home to watch it. My feelings are kinda mixed though. The video quality is really crisp, and they do some clever editing from time to time. But this where things get hazy. Ya see, George's band, the ""Ace in the Hole"", sounds great, I really like the dual guitar parts in the Fireman. But the DVD rarely shows the other band playing. It shows a lot of the drummer for some reason and since his back up singers are right behind ol' George himself, you see them every shot. Though Marty the backup singer is freakin gorgeous. But anyway,the bottom line is that they show alot of George and not enough of the band. But thats not neccasarily a bad thing. George sings with such conviction, it gives me goosebumps. I really like ""Love without End"" and ""The Best Day"" (A DVD only track). George looks like he is gonna cry on the latter. Anyway, there are NO extras but its a lot of George and you get [many] hits so the man gets 4 stars. Buy this if you are a George Strait fan, and you won't be dissapointed.",1046822400,11,1220,4.195744680851064

1831633,5,B00008977O,"When the star of a country music concert arrives on a horse, you get a sense you're in for a real country treat. While I'm a huge fan of Garth Brooks, George Strait is just as excellent. Unlike Brooks, who was a major showman during his concerts, Strait just gets up there and, without much fanfare, gives a fantastic performance for the audience. It's Captain America without any frills.

Thoroughly enjoyable DVD and highly recommended for country music fans.",1378944000,,461,4.8354430379746836

1831644,5,B00008977O,"If you are a fan of REAL country music, I highly recommend this fantastic concert performance of my vote for the king of country music:  George Strait.  Not only is the Ace in the Hole Band one of the best, tightest-sounding group of musicians I've ever heard play live, their sound is well-captured on this DVD.  Although this was before the days of High Def video viewing products, this DVD can truly be appreciated for its musical content.  Strait reminds us what real country is supposed to sound like with guitar-picking twang, fiddles, and steel guitar.  It's a fantastically far cry from the crap that supposedly passes for country music these days like Taylor Swift and George reminds us in the video why he's the king of this genre and what true talent is all about.  And guess what, the guy's got a great live voice - it's great to hear when people can actually sing live (not like the aforementioned, talentless Swift).....Amazon delivered in a timely fashion and I was completely satisfied with the product/dlvy.",1360108800,2,1024,4.7897727272727275

1831653,5,B00008977O,"Love this dvd of George, a mixture of hits gone by and a few current. I just wish it had accompaning videos as seen on cmt as Alan Jackson does, but after all this is a cocert! If produced later, Troubadour would have been an excellent song to end with. ""Run"" is a favorite startib slow and then uptempo urging you to get to him at any speed, anyhow. I can still make cheyanne is a sad ballad of a rejected love due to his being away so much, and Blue Clear sky is such a laid back descriptive melody. I am not generally fond of a few Texas swing songs, but he pulls them off well. He's a true, rugged, nonhyped authentic cowboy, without the glamerous costumes and lights, and truly masters this concert as well as Alan jackson or Kenny Chesney. He was and is the leader of the cowboy hat brigade of powerful country musicans. You'll put this dvd in, no matter what kind of day you had, and enjoy!",1236297600,,897,4.190751445086705

1831663,5,B00008977O,"A few years ago I was in Nashville and I was just getting to like George Strait. I walked into one of the stores to see what they had. This cd was there and I decided to buy it. It was my first, and certanly not my last, GS cd.
  I loved all the songs ,a few I had heard (at the time) before, and I loved the talking parts, almost like I was there. I had to get the dvd. When I went back my family and I went to the Hall of Fame and they had the dvd. I got it and I loved it.
  The song ""The cowboy rides away"" I found out was shortend yet lengthend. If you have heard the cd you know what I am talking about. Plus there are more songs on the dvd than the cd. Needless to say, this cd was the cd that kicked off my love for GS songs and music. If you have not heard it get it. It is a part of history.",1135641600,,801,3.534090909090909

I wondered about the background noise I'd heard about on this CD- but while there was some crowd noise it certainly didn't interfere with his performance- and besides, some crowd noise is to be expected with a taped, live, performance. However, when George began to sing my husband and I were both so caught up with the music; his delicious voice, and his excellent band that nothing else mattered. I recommend this CD for all George Strait fans. By the way, George should be THE spokesperson for Stetson because he sure does make that hat look good!",1125100800,2,696,4.576

1831668,4,B00008977O,"George Strait was given the honor of playing the final concert at the Houston Astrodome in 2002.  He appeared frequently at the Astrodome in the past, so his concert was an emotional occasion for George and his fans.  I've never had the chance to see George in concert, but I really love his music.  Fortunately, this DVD captures him in nice form performing some of his greatest hits.

1) Write This Down
2) I Can Still Make Cheyenne
3) Heartland
4) Love Without End, Amen - a real highlight as George dedicates it to former President Bush.
5) Check Yes Or No
6) The Fireman
7) Run
8) Murder On Music Row - originally a duet with Alan Jackson, George ably handles it solo.
9) The Chair - the crowd really loved this song.
10) She'll Leave You With A Smile
11) Amarillo By Morning - my all-time favorite George Strait song, and an obvious crowd favorite as well.
12) Living and Living Well
13) Take Me Back To Tulsa - I wasn't previously familiar with this Texas swing song, which I think was originally recorded by Bob Wills.
14) Blue Clear Sky
15) The Cowboy Rides Away - a fitting concert end

During the concert, George mentions that he came down with laryngitis before the concert, and his vocals are sometimes a bit below his normal standard.  However, the opportunity to see George in his only live DVD is well worth the patchy spots.  Former President Bush even presents George with a special award, and George is clearly moved.  Overall, this DVD presents a solid and sometimes emotional concert that is likely to please fans of great, traditional country music.",1097452800,78,1571,4.565836298932385

I saw the performance on this DVD live at the Astrodome that night.  It was truly the most awesome performance I have ever seen.  It was everything, great music, great atmosphere, truly history-in-the-making.  My only complaint is that this DVD did not include the entire show, which was spectacular!

She has been a huge fan of George Strait since he started and to be honest, I used to make fun of her and him.  I used to work outside of Amarillo and I would sing the chorus to ""Amarillo by Morning"" everytime I called her.  To say the least, I am a huge fan now.  I cannot stop listening to his music and everytime I hear a different song it becomes a new favorite.

If there is too much crowd noise in the surround speakers, just lower the surround level on your receiver! The sound is dynamic and clean. The 2 channel mix is great too.

And this dvd is probably the closest I'll ever come.  I am not a George Strait fanatic.  And this is a whole lot better then I thought it would be.  He has so many songs that he would probably have to be on stage for about twelve hours to do them all.  And he does a good number of them here.  Like Check Yes Or No, and Blue Clear Sky.
