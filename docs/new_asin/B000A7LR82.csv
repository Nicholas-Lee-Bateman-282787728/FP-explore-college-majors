2378002,4,B000A7LR82,"First off this movie is described as a comedy and a drama, though theres not much of the former. That being said the movie is like an Iraqi Lord of the Flies. It's acting is good and the plot line is mystical.  Turtles is a great Iraqi movie.",1128816000,,242,4.041666666666667
2378003,5,B000A7LR82,"Even though ""Lakposhtha hm parvaz mikonand"" (""Turtles Can Fly"") is set on the eve of the Iraq war it is not really about that conflict.  The film is a joint Iran-Iraq venture with France apparently figuring in somehow, but the langauge being spoken is Kurdish because the characters in this 2004 film are Kurds, living in a refugee camp on the Turkish border.  Consequently, the film actually takes place more in Kurdistan, the ethnic region that extends into both Turkey and Iraq (as well as Iran, Armenia, and Syria), more so than in the Iraq that is about to be invaded by the United States and its allies.  The politics of the war are rather inconsequential to these people, people the idea that Mr. Bush and the Americans are good and Saddam Hussein is bad.  When the war begins things will change, and since they could not be much worse maybe they will be better.

The world of the camp seems to be composed entirely of orphaned children and old men.  The kids even have their own leader, a young boy called Satellite (Soran Ebrahim), who orders work gangs out into the fields to dig arm land mines that can be sold to the arms dealers in the closest town.  You will be surprised what you can get in a world where land minds are prime battering material.  Satellite even manages to bring in a satellite dish, so that the elders can watch the news (and not the prohibited channels) to find out when the war will start.  But it is not FOX news that provides the warning.

That would be Hengov (Hirsh Feyssal), a boy whose arms have already been blown off by a mine and who now disarms them by removing the firing pin with his lips.  Right there that should tell you what sort of hell on earth these children are living in, but it gets worse.  Satellite is smitten with Hengov's sister, Agrin (Avaz Latif), who is caring for their younger brother.  But little Riga (Abdol Rahman Karim) is not Agrin's little brother and she wants to get rid of the child despite Hengov's wishes.  Satellite is interested in Agrin, but then he discovers that Hengov has the gift of prophecy.  Such knowledge can be a more valuable currency than even land mines or satellite dishes.

""Lakposhtha hm parvaz mikonand"" is written and directed by Bahman Ghobadi (""A Time for Drunken Horses""), who has made a political film that basically points a finger at everybody whose silence assents to this situation.  Once the Americans arrive they basically ignore the refugees.  Humvees drive by, with soldiers running along side, without looking at the deformed children they pass.  But I do not see this as anti-American sentiment but a metaphor for the geopolitical reality of the Kurds.  After all, the camp is under the view of watch towers in Turkey where there are also soldiers with guns who want to make sure the refugees stay on the other side of the border.  There are plenty of stones to throw on this one and Ghobadi underscores the right of the Kurds to do so.",1128297600,6,2947,4.575238095238095
2378004,5,B000A7LR82,"'Lakposhtha hm parvaz mikonand' (TURTLES CAN FLY) takes your breath away.  Not only is the story by writer/director Bahman Ghobadi timely, it is one of the most devastatingly real examinations of the people of Iraq in the days before the American preemptive attack: it is more real because the entire story is told through the eyes of children.

The action takes place in Kurdistan, Iraq at the Turkish border.  The temporary refugee camp in the hills is occupied by children who make money by gathering live mines and used shells from the military conditions under Saddam Hussein's rule.  They struggle to make deals for a satellite dish so that they can provide coverage of the war for the elders (they are not allowed to watch Hussein's forbidden channels!), they form rival groups for the monetary aspects of weapons gathering, and they rely on a leader by the name of Satellite (Soran Ebrahim) who appears to be the oldest of the children.  His 'associates' are the  crippled boy Pashow (Saddam Hossein Feysal) able to run as fast as even Satellite on a bicycle with just one leg and a crutch; Shirkooh (Ajil Zibari) whose tears flow easily; Hengov (Hiresh Feysal Rahman) who lost his arms to the land mines and has the ability to foresee the future; and the mysterious  Agrin (Avaz Latif) the sole girl who with Hengov is caring for a blind two year orphan Riga (Abdol Rahman Karim).

The children, all orphans, are on the watch for war they know will come, watch and listen for the Americans to arrive, and struggle for survival under Satellite's organized control.  Agrin wishes to escape it all, pleads with Hengov to return to their home, but Hengov will not leave the child Riga. As the tension mounts tragedies occur, touching all of the children.  But the manner in which the children finally observe as Hussein's statue topples and as the American troops distribute 'hopeful' fliers from helicopters, events bringing an end to their temporary refuge camp status, is heart-wrenchingly portrayed.

The film is full of passion.  The young 'actors' are splendid: how Ghobadi found such children to play tough parts in such a wholly naturalistic way is a true feat of genius.  This is a powerful, disturbing, yet ultimately beautiful film that deserves everyone's close attention. In Kurdish with English subtitles. Highly recommended!

2378056,5,B000A7LR82,"One of the best movies I've seen in a while.

In the days preceding the Iraq War, a charismatic boy commands the respect and loyalty of a ragtag group of orphaned children who dig up unexploded mines for pay. But he's mesmerized by a beautiful young homeless girl who wanders into the town's refugee camp with her clairvoyant older brother and a toddler they've taken under their wing.

Rebelling against playing the role of mother to a rambunctious toddler when she's just a child herself, and dealing with the aftermath of horrific abuse, the girl ties up the toddler to a tree and abandons him, figuring someone will find him and take care of him. But when the toddler breaks free of his binds and wanders into a no-man's land of landmines, the boy leader's life is changed forever when he tries to rescue the toddler in a bid to win the affections of the girl.",1333756800,2,864,4.532051282051282
2378057,5,B000A7LR82,"This joint Iraq/Iran production is a story of Kurdish children surviving in a refugee camp awaiting the American invasion and surviving by collecting mines and shells to sell to the UN. It is full of brutal reality and a horrific kind of beauty. Its unflinching portrayal of children being maimed and killed is complemented by full character development and brilliant novelistic details behind the stories of Satellite, Agrin, the boy with no arms, and the orphaned child they all care for. I think it is also one of the best portrayals of the chaos of war from childrens' point of view ever captured on film. What was truly amazing was seeing how the children cared for one another and formed their own social order. This kind of story is not something usually distributed in this form and it's refreshing to see that making films has become affordible enough to produce such works. I think this film should be shown to all American school children aged 9 and up as they shuffle in and out of the upcoming Bush library ('lieberry?') whenever it is built at SMU, but maybe it will only be on one of the ""prohibited channels"" in Texas.",1327190400,2,1134,4.675
2378058,5,B000A7LR82,"First off, let me just say this movie is not for everyone. It's PG-13 rating for disturbing scenes involving children is true to its description. If you can't handle that, or if you're looking for a ""feel-good"" movie, try watching something else.

On the other hand, the movie is really powerful, and probably the best I've seen in a long time. If you love politics, and/or you want a movie that will make you cry, this one is it. The movie shows what can realistically happen to a group of mostly orphaned kids in war-torn Iraq. It's in Kurdish, but the English subtitles make it easy to follow.

The only thing I didn't like about the DVD itself was that there are no bonus features. The average person will get really emotionally involved with this movie, wanting to find out more after the film is finished, but there's no director's commentary or interview with the actors or anything. Even on the internet, you might be able to find out more about the director, but nothing on these talented young actors.

I'm sure you've read other reviews that describe the actual plot, so I won't repeat it. But I will say that there are many surprises along the way, and watching this will encourage discussions about Saddam Hussein's regime and the recent US war on Iraq.",1292457600,3,1266,4.6177777777777775
2378059,3,B000A7LR82,"To echo Shakespeare, this film was ""tediously intense."" The film drags and offers too much pointless ""reflection"" that doesn't create empathy or provide insight. The characters seem disconnected from one another, and the storyline, which revolves around children sans any adult oversight (perhaps the point?), gives the film a ""Lord of the Flies"" quality. Ironically, the contextual plot itself is intensely disturbing and powerful. I felt like the premise and message of the film could have provided a moving conduit for awareness in regard to the Iraq War - and the film still provides an excellent example of how the atrocities of war affect the innocent. Instead, the disconnects promote confusion and the pointless endless camera pans give the film an amateurish quality.",1285545600,,776,5.317073170731708
2378060,5,B000A7LR82,"Satellite is an enterprising teenager who stays so busy he only subconsciously notices the devastating effects of being an exiled Kurd in No Man's Land. He wears black-rimmed glasses and runs around installing antennae like a human dynamo. He lives in a barren limbo between Iraq and Turkey, dismantling land mines and selling them to arms dealers in exchange for weapons and a satellite dish. He reminds me of a plucky kid in ""Newsies"", only instead of selling newspapers and rebelling against a wealthy magnate, he commands a group of refugee orphans trying to survive in a moral wasteland domineered by Saddam Hussein. This may seem like grim subject matter for a foreign film, but ""Turtles Can Fly"" has surprising moments of humor and warmth. Often it plays like an ""Our Gang"" movie set in a combat zone. Among Satellite's closest friends are Pashow, who has a crippled leg yet is swift as a cheetah using his left foot and a crutch. Shirkooh is an earnest boy who is ""at Satellite's service"", yet spends much of his time weeping over tragedies that befall the outcast children. The beauty of this story (and what maintains its bouyancy throughout times of despair) is the resilience of the orphans and the way they thrive without feeling sorry for themselves. They do what they can to survive, and even find generosity in their hearts to provide for strangers. When Satellite kindly provides a girl with three meters of rope, he feels like he is doing her a favor, even though her motivation in securing the gift is morbid and disturbing.
  Many may avoid this film, thinking it has a political message, but I feel it illuminates the plight of disenfranchised people who can do little to alter their fate. Americans aren't demonized; instead, their arrival is eagerly aniticipated by the village elders, who feel their kinsmen will finally be wrenched from Hussein's tyrannical grasp. It's a sad fact that when U.S. troops finally storm the region, soldiers hurry past the orphans without paying them any heed. Once again, they are ignored.
  The film is filled with desolate yet unforgettable imagery. Flashbacks to when Iraqi soldiers terrorized a village haunt a girl (Agrin), who is looked after by her brother, Hengov. Hengov lost both his arms when a bomb detonated, and now he neutralizes mines by removing the firing pin with his teeth. Somehow he is able to predict the future, something that horrifies him, crowding his mind with apocalyptic scenes. He looks after a blind toddler who has a strange knack for avoiding death. The doomed triangle between Agrin (who despises the child for tragic reasons) and her empathetic brother provides a bleak counterpoint for the hopefulness of the refugee children.
  The acting is amazing. None of the kids are seasoned actors, but they are wholly credible and authentic. The pacing is dynamic. Seeing ""Turtles Can Fly"" is liked travelling to a foreign country and immersing yourself in an unfamiliar culture. It's disorienting at first, but slowly you fall in love with the people and their unflinching strength in times of war. When Satellite almost has his foot blown off, you feel his pain. His friends are loyal, remaining by his side and even presenting him with a dismembered arm from Saddam's fallen statue. They make the most of their world, finding simple pleasures that eclipse the banality of cell phones, internet, and video games. If Satellite and his companions were transported to America from an impoverished village with only the clothes on their back, they would have important lessons to teach us.",1269129600,3,3572,4.954924874791319

2378083,5,B000A7LR82,"This movie is extraordinary by every measure and a must see for any serious and caring person.  It is as poetic, profound and timeless a story about the hearts and lives of children and youth in a world of ceaseless war and boundaryless inhumanity.  When adults surrender their meaningful civilized role model and become submerged in craven accommodation to violence and gainful survival, children are sacrificed and must construct their own grotesque and angst filled society to survive.  It is hard to imagine how such a story as  ""Turtles Can Fly"" could be visually imagined and translated into a movie of such breathtaking originality and power.  Each character, each shot, each scene, each step in the compassionate revalation of its story is riveting and awe inspiring in production and sheer beauty.

Left to scratching the unfertile earth of a Kurdish border village for unexploded mines and ordinance just prior to the US invasion of Iraq, bands of children work together to earn pittance from a weapons merchant, in their weapons economy, to just get by.  Many, armless and legless, and living in traditional scattered village hovels surrounded by abandoned war machines, bombs and discarded cannon shells, the children are organized and directed by a precocious teen who uses his skill with TV dish technology to leverage the village elders for resources and respect for his devoted and dependent band of children.  A 12 year old girl, always carrying a near 2 year old infant. is the center piece of the story. Her grace and sad mystery mesmerizes the teen leader who is in search of another youth who is alleged to ""see"" the future.  The community is wholly preoccupied with anticipating the impending US invasion that might change their circumstances in the face of the repressive and savage Saddam regime that has wrought the injury and individual scars on the region's peoples.  The protagonist girl carries a wrenching secret and the story of her relationship to the child she carts about becomes the center of the tragedy that slowly unfolds.  Her armless brother is the seer, the witness and respository of all the communities losses that he contains within himself, and, the tender but stern guardian of his sister's secret and the infant child.  An innocent and passing search for 3 meters of rope that the girl pursues which the teen protagonist provides becomes an haunting plot prop that is essential to the story becomes decisive as the lives and losses of the lead characters unfolds.  This is one of the finest and most moving pieces of modern art that I have ever experienced and a monument to the perspective changing power of genius filmmaking and social human caring imaginable in our world!",1254960000,4,2722,4.9823399558498895
2378084,5,B000A7LR82,"Turtles Can Fly is an especially good movie in that we get a rarely seen view of war from the children whose country is being ravaged by it. The performances in this film are nothing less than superlative and outstanding in every way; and I was fascinated by the way Iraqi towns, markets and refugee villages looked and operated on a social level. The cinematography is excellent; and the choreography couldn't be better either. This is a powerful film!

When the action starts we meet Satellite (Soran Ebrahim), a young boy in a small Kurdish town in Iraq just before the most recent Iraqi War. Satellite is, in essence, the leader of the village refugee children and many of the adults, too; and for such a young man he does an incredibly fine job of shepherding the flock. Satellite gets his name mostly because he is a local expert at hooking up Iraqi villages in the area to satellite television so that they can get the news. Satellite's right hand man (so to speak, they're all adolescents or children), Pashow (Saddam Hossein Feysal), helps Satellite anyway he can and Pashow is also Satellite's best friend and confidante. While Satellite wheels and deals, trading land mines for weapons for the soon to start war with America, he is also eyeing a pretty but very troubled young girl named Agrin (Avaz Latif). Agrin has a great deal of bitterness over the recent past; it seems that Agrin and her armless brother Hengov (Hiresh Feysal Rahman) lost their parents to murderers who left their own very small child behind--and now Agrin and Hengov are stuck raising the child of the people who killed their parents.

Hengov doesn't mind being ""Uncle Hengov"" to the young boy. He has much love in his heart; he also has an uncanny knack for making predictions about the future that almost always come true. Even Satellite uses Hengov's prediction about exactly when the Iraqi War will start.

Of course, from here the plot can go just about anywhere. Will the war start when Hengov predicts it will? How will Hengov and Agrin ever end their dispute about caring for the young boy left behind by the people who killed their parents? Will Satellite be able to make Agrin his girlfriend? No plot spoilers here--watch this excellent film and find out!

It may seem as if I've given too much of the plot away but when you watch this film you will know I really haven't. This is, as I wrote above, a rather powerful movie that you won't forget anytime soon. I wish that there were extras on the DVD; the only ""extra"" we get besides scene selection is a small number of ""previews"" that doesn't count for much. I would have loved director commentary on this film.

Turtles Can Fly paints a distressing portrait of just how badly children can be affected by terrible war. This is a great film for people interested in social causes and children's rights in foreign countries especially; and people interested in the Iraqi War may also like this movie.",1234051200,2,2946,4.67953667953668
2378085,5,B000A7LR82,"From start to finish, this movie shows a world that only a handful of Americans have ever been exposed to, personally or in film. The tragedy of war is shown from a refugee-child's perspective, and depicts a world of homelessness, filth and survival by whatever means available.

Imagine, for instance, that the only means of income was to send your children into a minefield and gather mines for sale in the marketplace. Image your child trading these mines for guns in order to defend the camp.

Revealed in this wonderful movie is the innocence of a child lost, the daily challenge to stay alive and the absence of food, potable water and a way to stay clean, even to a minimum.

The overriding message is one of hopelessness. These children have the where-to-all to survive, they have intelligence and motivation, but they have no hope because they have zero opportunity. And when the US troops finally arrive, I was left with the question, ""Did their arrival make a difference?"" I don't know. But what I do know is that we can learn a lot from these children about life, about survival and about hope. For when we see hopelessness, they can can clearly see a glimmer of hope.",1230940800,,1180,4.663461538461538

2378088,5,B000A7LR82,"The title TURTLES CAN FLY is actually a metaphor for the film. They, the children  (and presumably the Kurdish people), are like the turtle, struggling to navigate and rise above a sea of adversities, namely their surroundings and circumstances. In this case, they are refugees on the Turkish-Iraqi border eking out a living to gather and sell scrap military equipment, namely landmines.

While watching Bahman Ghobad's film TURTLES CAN FLY I kept thinking how gutsy and enterprising the children were amidst their desperate condition. Their light humour and camaraderie gave me the impression they would prevail amidst their trials and tribulations, although it would not be an easy task.

Throughout the film you feel the Kurdish people's nomadic existence. In particular, you feel Agrin's (Avaz Latif) lost innocence from a gang rape by Iraqi soldiers in Halabche, her antipathy for the child born of this crime and her futility to care for her blind child in a culture that has perhaps cast her out. You feel Henkov's (Hiresh Feysal Rahman) nobility to hold the family together, to protect his sister's honour and the life of the child, even though he is physically handicapped. You feel Satellite's (Soran Ebrahim) love for and loss of Agrin and the child, as well as his own uncertainty of the future at the end of the film.

Surprising, there are no heroes in this film: not the children, not the village elders, not the black-marketers, not the American army.  The story unfolds as a documentary, revealing events as they more or less happen, while weaving a subtle moral tale within it.

So allow me, a presently unproud American who has served his country, to question why ""we are the best in the world""? Does our might make us so, our arrogance, our ignorance, our excess, our vanity? What god-awful temerity allows us to make this God-like claim to vanquish sorrow?
So allow me, also, this introspection: I haven't the dedication, the loyalty, the love, the compassion of any one of the orphaned Iraqi children pictured in this movie. Shame on me. May the spirit of the doomed children in this movie invade me. Let them liberate me!

2378114,5,B000A7LR82,"This is a movie about liberation. Liberation from pain, mostly, and liberation from an unnatural childhood. The calvary coming over the hill isn't the most significant form of liberation in this movie. Some reviewers are praising this movie as a depiction of children during wartime. No, that's not exactly right. These Kurdish children are where they are because they are running away from the brutalities of Saddam's constant clamp down on the Kurds. They are not victims of a war, per se, and certainly not the current war. They are victims of tyranny and attempted genocide. Bahman Ghobadi's other film, ""Marooned in Iraq"" gives a good idea of why they are where they are. The mines the kids are digging up--well, I don't know why they're there--simply a defense against the Turks or some way to terrorize the Kurds? That's never stated. This is not a war movie. There is no ""war"" through most of this film and when the current war starts is very unclear. I would actually say there is no war through all of this film. The American invasion is mostly just an impending event which doesn't happen visually until near the end of the movie, and without bombs bursting in air. Don't sit foolishly through this film waiting for that to happen.

Most of the various important events of self-liberation and non-liberation experienced by the film's young characters happen before the invasion, within their tentative existence there, pushed up against the farthest fence of Saddam's brutal world.  The well-paced plot forever rides on Satellite's unrelenting ingenuity to survive and flourish and achieve that which he most wants to achieve, despite the waiting and huddling all around him. His is certainly an unnatural childhood. How natural is it for a 13 year old to be commanding, at times, a large population? And talk about extras! There's a couple extraordinary scenes of that population with enough extras to rival the battle scenes in ""Spartacus!"" Quite a sight! It's all about children, though. The young actors' performances are as real and as powerfully delivered as any of the best of adult actors. Truly an amazing accomplishment. And that youngest of actors--and you'd have to call him that--how in the world? I'd like to see how he was filmed and directed, but the DVD is unfortunately completely lacking any special features. Interesting to see, also, that in this Iran-Iraq co-production the Americans seemingly have white hats, although they pass by very quickly. Or do they have white hats? There's a few Imams in the region who probably would have something to say about what they do for the villagers on top of the hill. Otherwise, as we've all seen too well over the past few years, true liberation, if it can happen at all, has almost nothing to do with simply knocking down a statue, and for some, liberation, when it hits, is sometimes a two-edged sword.",1190764800,,2877,4.905544147843942

I don't know if it was concentrating on reading the subtitles and following the story or what but the full force of this film did not hit me until the end as the credits began filling the screen.

The suffering, uncertainty and poverty faced by so many people including those most hard hit, children, around the world is staggering and so painful when one lets it settle into one's heart and mind. I cried so hard after the movie was done just thinking of all those children all over the world that live in such dire circumstances. We all hear about poverty and such but this movie ""brought it home"" to me in really a unique way.

However, the uncertainty of war & the responsibility of looking after a boy can be so overwhelming that in the end, she would do the unthinkable. Only then that we get to tie in the movie together. It's rather an eye opener to see the refugees camp, the invasion of the Americans from another perspective.  Nonetheless, what made this movie truly splendid is the non-pretentiousness of those children who are seemingly living their ""normal"" lives & only then that we realise how fortunate we are and that we can't possibly take anything for granted.

Here are some of the pictures that Bahman Ghobadi, the director of the film, paints for us: a young man without arms who has lost them doing the only trade that once afforded him - picking up landmines; a beautiful pre-teen who's been a victim of rape from a group of ravenous soldiers; a blind infant who's hope is placed in the fate of two teenaged strangers. These are the characters who allow us to see the war as they see it, and the picture is not nice, sweet, or glorious. The result is a feeling that will leave you detesting war more than ever, regardless of your political or personal views on any war the world has been engaged in. Those walls built by pro or anti agendas will begin to fall, and you will lose yourself as you too attempt to emotionally climb out of the experience you've just been a part of.

2378120,5,B000A7LR82,"Kurdish director Bahman Ghobadi situates this poignant film in a Kurdish refugee camp on the Turkish-Iraq border just before the outbreak of the US-Iraq war. The film revolves around a 13-year old boy nicknamed ""Satellite"" for his enterprising ways. Satellite barters, buys and installs TV dishes so the village can get foreign news about rumors of war. He organizes the village children into an economic cartel. They clear fields of land mines, which they then resell, and stack discarded empty artillery casings. Parallel to this big picture of village life among displaced Kurds runs an important smaller story. Satellite has a crush on the orphaned girl Arin, who along with her armless brother Hengov takes care of the blind toddler Risa whom she bore when she was raped by Iraqi soldiers. Only in the last few minutes of the film does the war begin, and of course the Kurds were happy for liberation from Saddam by America. But when you learn what happens to Satellite, Arin, Hengov and little Risa, you understand why in the final scene Satellite turns his back on the American army vehicles as they roar through the muddy village in the rain, as his buddy exclaims, ""I thought you always wanted to see the Americans."" I think Ghobadi intends a deeply human commentary rather than a political statement, to the effect that seen through the surreal experiences of these children, war is hell on earth. It is difficult to know which is more real or more terrifying, the nightmares that Hengov has or the ""reality"" of their waking hours.

2378138,4,B000A7LR82,"On the Iraqi-Kurd border, just before the start of the Iraq war, refugees gather. They are mainly comprised by an army of parentless children, many maimed by explosions. Their leader is ""Satellite"" -- a nerdy and obnoxiously assertive techie who finds jobs for his dozens of young charges. One day, they may be removing mines from a farmer's field. Another day, they are holding wires across a hillside, hoping for better TV reception.

Into their midst comes a sullen young trio -- an armless teen, his 12-year-old sister, and a 2-year old they refer to as ""the child."" There is an aura of unspeakable loss about them. The sister continually contemplates suicide as she passes ponds or cliffs. Her older brother attempts to get her to care for the child, whom she resolutely avoids. The trio is mostly isolated from the rest of the children, until the brother's ability to tell the future attracts Satellite's interest.

The movie is mostly well shot, its stunningly desolate landscapes echoing the lives of the characters. Some of the cinematography is shockingly beautiful -- an underwater shot of an armless boy swimming in a murky pool being one. The movie is also unspeakably depressing. The sight of so many (apparently real) limbless children is not the stuff of happy endings. At its core, this is a film about the constant fight for survival in a stark and unhappy situation. There are those like Satellite who wheedle and bluster their way from one day to the next, and there are those who follow. There are those who struggle with their inner demons as well as the ones conjured by warring adults. There are no happy endings for the children in the film, but only another day of stubbornly coping with a brutal existence.

In one particularly terrifying early scene, an armless boy successfully defuses a land mine with his mouth.

The story takes place in early 2003, during the advent of the U.S. and coalition invasion of Iraq. The Kurdish refugees hope for better lives, but fear the worst, given their extensive sufferings under Hussein's brutal Baathist regime.

The children are led by a boy nicknamed Satellite (Soran Ebrahim), for his role in buying and installing illicit satellite dishes in the area's villages, so that elders can watch the news--although most of it is in English, Farsi and other languages they don't understand.

Satellite's acolytes include a one-legged younger boy, Pashow (Saddam Hossein Feysal), who hobbles quickly alongside his mentor's bike, despite his crutches; Shirkooh (Ajil Zibari), a compelling cry-baby who narrates his travails--while vociferously demonstrating the slaps rained on him by his tormentors;  an armless newcomer named Hengov (Hiresh Feysal Rahman), a victim of land mines with the psychic ability to foresee upcoming events; and Hengov's beautiful sister Agrin (Avaz Latif). Her rape (apparently by Baathist Iraqi forces) produced the blind child Riga (Abdol Rahman Karim), a ""bastard"" whom Agrin tends, but cannot bring herself to love.

This film is tragic, and very realistic. Its villains are Saddam Hussein's forces. But there are no real heroes, for no one can rescue these children from their shattered lives.

It would be hard to imagine a more pertinent and relevant film than ""Turtles Can Fly,"" an Iran/Iraq co-production that, like a modern day version of ""Forbidden Games,"" looks at the horrors of war through the eyes of its most helpless and innocent victims - children.  Set in a poor village located in Kurdistan, just a few steps from Iraq's barb-wired border with Turkey, ""Turtles Can Fly"" begins right before the American invasion of that Arab country in the spring of 2003.  Many of the children of the village are orphaned refugees who earn money by finding, defusing, and then selling the many active land mines that lie strewn across the barren countryside.  This is literally how most of them make their living.  The main character is a teenaged boy who goes by the name of Satellite (one of his many duties is to hook up satellite dishes for the villagers' TV's) who, much like a pint-sized Fagin, sends his gang of kids - many crippled and missing limbs - out on daily missions to forage for mines.  Another major character is a young girl who was raped by the soldiers who killed her family and who now carries the burden of ""shame"" that comes with having had a child out of wedlock and whose actions in this realm ultimately lay the groundwork for the story`s final tragedy.

Given its harsh subject matter, ""Turtles Can Fly"" - which features wonderful performances from a group of children, some of whom have themselves lost limbs to landmines - is not always easy to watch, but there is a surprising amount of humor in the movie, as well as a tender-hearted compassion for its characters that makes it a compelling, moving experience.  Much of the humor comes from the near-surreal juxtaposition of a Medieval existence and mindset with devices of modern technology such as trucks, television sets, satellite dishes etc.  The protagonist's no-nonsense, sardonic approach to life and the people around him also generates some much-needed humor.

But, ultimately, this is a poignant, haunting movie that opens up a world largely unfamiliar to those of us living out our far more comfortable lives in the West.  The movie is basically a series of slice-of-life vignettes that help us to understand the appalling conditions under which people in that part of the world are forced to survive.  Yet even as they eke out some sort of existence against the greatest of odds, these youngsters still find time to laugh and play and fall in love, a fact that is bound to strike a responsive chord in viewers the world over.  For the film is a heartbreaking and vivid reminder that when adults play at their games of war, it is the children of the world who suffer the most.",1161561600,6,2683,4.73175965665236

In many ways, this film is exactly what you'd expect from a ""poor orphans struggling to survive"" sort of story; they've got an almost familial bond to their ragtag band, a spunky and charismatic leader they love and follow unquestioningly, and dangerous jobs to be done for paltry wages.  If these were American kids in the Depression, or Victorian English kids, this would be just like any other movie on the ""poor orphan"" theme, so it's definitely the Iraq War setting that sets this one apart.

Satellite, a teenager, is the leader of the camp orphans, who make money by disarming land mines and then reselling the mines to arms dealers.

All of the children in this film suffer from devastation wrought by the adult world: a world of war. Agrin, raped by Iraqi soldiers as a girl, is now an adolescent and a mother to a blind toddler, Riga, that she pretends is her brother. The children are living adult lives -- selling war machinery & setting up satellite dishes, parenting or providing camp leadership - but the events that led to their transformation into pseudo adults has also left them maimed and psychically damaged.

The film opens and closes with a jump/flight over a vertiginous cliff. Premonition? The war tale somehow manages to be capitavating to look at as well, which given that the village, the dominant stage, is one half refugee, tent-city and the other armourey detritus, is an achievement. There is not an adult of reproductive age on deck. The Kurdish kids are lead by the charismatic and irrepressible, Satellite who wheels and deals the pickings from the peasant's mine fields in order to eek a precarious living on behalf of his charges. In the absence of the aforesaid parents, the kids are prematurely aged. It is  this cast of the maimed and wizened that forms a centrepiece of immense gravity in Ghobadi's tale. A brief scene of the blind orphan calling for his mother down the stack of used shells(that in 'normal' times would be a stack of winter wood) is a cinematic masterstroke. The key figures are archetypal. The Armless Boy who lives with the most horrendous premonitions; his sister who has been raped and later suicides after drowning the orphan child they have 'inherited'; and Satellite's dependance on his second-sighted rival, brother to the permanently damaged girl of his affections.  Ghobadi's tale avoids sentimentality with its pragmatic, grim humour. The village elders are impotent before the devastation and dependant on the adolescent, Satellite to drip feed misinformation from the TV's skewered nformation of events. The US 'copter leaflet drop, promising help that is about as lightweight as the paper its written on, is unlikely to relieve the tragedy at ground level, as the film's protaganists crutch off to the right in the closing image.",1147305600,5,1798,5.091525423728814
2378146,5,B000A7LR82,"Not for the faint of heart, Turtles is a semi-realistic portrayal of life in Iraq after the first Gulf War.  It could be described as a mix between The Thin Red Line and Lord of the Flies, offering both a subtle philosophic insight into the outcomes of war and a narrative built around children being forced into the role of adults.

Turtle's follows the lives of Satellite, Henvkov, and Agrin - three orphaned children in Iraq - following a war that has taken their families, and even given them new ones in Agrin's case.  Satellite fills the role of dictator to a group of displaced and orphaned children in his region.  With the onslaught of war, Satellite's leadership presents the only hope available to a troubled group of children facing scant chance of survival.  At first a money driven youth seeking whatever possessions his skills can bribe, Satellite eventually falls in love with Agrin.  This love eventually envelopes her child Pashow.  Agrin's brother Henkov is almost as resistant as Agrin is to return the benevolence of Satellite; although in Henkov's case, Satellite is more interested in prophesy than friendship.

Through the three main characters, we are given three perspectives that have developed in seemingly similar situations.  In Satellite's case, we find a man searching for the riches of the world, and when money and possessions don't satisfy his desires he begins to seek love.  Satellite still has hope that the world will satisfy his desires for love and happiness.  Henkov is a compassionate person who understands the realities of a fallen world - his insight into the world gives him a spiritual presence that magnifies itself through the gift of prophesy.  Agrin is a troubled girl who has no hope in the future or the present.  Her depression is largely the result of the first war, but she inevitably chooses sadness over the joy of new life.

The movie takes us into the landscape and culture of Iraq on the precipice of the second Iraq war.  The director gives us a rare glimpse into the realities of war and life in the Middle East.

I didn't think that it compared to Lord of the Flies.  In this film, the children have a thoughtful leader, and as a group they care for each other, they share, and they are not cruel.

I do disagree with the description here of the American troops who finally pass through the refugee camp.  There are just a few scenes of the troops in their five or six carriers and jeeps, with four or five soldiers trotting next to them.  Anyone who has been in an invading army, or traveled with one, knows that it watches initially for signs of the enemy rather than stopping for every civilian in distress.  That comes later.

As a matter of fact, only one good thing happens to these children in the movie.  Just one, and it is done by the Americans, offscreen.  So as to avoid a spoiler, I won't mention it.  However, it completely changes the childrens' lives.  Odd that no one else thought to note it.

There is also the bastard child, Agrin's son, I assume, whom she hates the sight of. This sad child is like an albatross around her neck and is a constant reminder of the horror she has suffered, long before the arrival of the Americans.

All the characters are swept along by the news of the impending arrival of the Americans into Iraq, putatively to take away the people's suffering. Ironically, the last shot of the movie shows the clean, white healthy Americans running right by Satellite and his friend, completely ignoring them.

2378150,4,B000A7LR82,"Turtles Can Fly is unlike anything you have probably ever seen, an incredibly poignant and gripping story of the real affect of civil war on innocent humans - the children- caught in its path.  This is a film that will make you cry.  It is set in Kurdistan on the eve of the 2003 American invasion of Iraq, and it follows the Iraqi Kurds who have been the victims of racial and ethnic cleansing in Iraq. A teenage boy known as ""Satellite"" is the charismatic leader of a village of refugee children, organizing the dangerous sweeping and clearing of the minefields and selling the unexploded mines to pay for food and provisions.  Mature and focused on the welfare of these children, Satellite is a natural leader whom both children and adults look to for guidance.  As the film departs, Satellite takes interest in a new orphan to the group, a teenage girl traveling with her two brothers- one aged 3 and one also a teenager, a boy who is tragically armless yet gifted in that he appears to be able to see the future. Only later in the film does the viewer discover the real truth about the siblings as the horrific events of their background -and future- is unveiled.

The entire story is set in the refugee camp at the border of Turkey in a very gritty and real ""documentary like"" filming technique.  The story is amazing- it is heart wrenching and sickening, especially as it is told from the perspective of the children.  The scenery is equally disturbing- this looks less like a movie set and more like you are on location in Iraq.  This is an excellent film -my only grievance is that, even with reading subtitles, the acting seems very forced and the children often appear to scream their lines for effectiveness.  Perhaps if one is a native speaker of Kurdish then this will not be a problem but when relying on subtitles the emotional delivery of the characters- face and bodies -is equally as important and at times the monotonous loud voiced children were distracting. However one actor, the child playing the 3 year old, was able to -despite his young years -give a very haunting and disturbing performance that in itself is enough to make the viewer tearful.

Turtles Can Fly is a must-see for anybody interested in modern day politics, history, culture and the human condition.  There are a few funny moments involving certain of the children's characters but all-in-all this is an incredibly sad and original story.  The movie has subtitles in yellow and no bonus features.",1137888000,4,2488,4.694252873563219
2378151,5,B000A7LR82,"as a war photogrpaher...one that does not make use of traditional media...i find myself constantly battling with the impossibility of capturing war in its unthinkable simulteneity....how do you express the horror...the beauty(that will always endure..not to sound trite)..the unthinkable.. and most importantly the humane..???

i realized for myself while covering the war in northern uganda that mainstream media will never allow war to be human..never to be something that one can relate to in the west..certainly such an act would change the very face of the world...in its illusion of disconnect....this seems to be beyond what american culture demands from the media..perhaps merely out of inertia...

anyway..turtles can fly will change you...soran ebrahim deserves praise...to capture the sublime..to humanize.. this is the challenge to those of us 'mediating' our fragmented world..to get beyond sheer horror..back to the everyday...to our bare priomordial day-to-day...this is where we can relate...how do you build empathy with 'horror' stories that are so easily categorized in abstract language...the 'other'..that 'thing in the news'....this may sound sick..it is..the point is..we are able to drink coffee with our newspapaer because the stories and images are just that absract..they are no longer with us...this film defeats all of that..i am grateful to soran ebrahim...this is not just a masterpiece..this is inspiration...

....mind you i have neglected to mention the visceral beauty of this film...it will defeat all attempts to push the subject out of mind...too beautiful to stop looking...too important to forget...",1135468800,8,1639,5.7366255144032925
2378152,5,B000A7LR82,"This movie, similar to Osama that was filemed in Pashtun with English subtitles, this movie depicts the life of a group of orphan children in a refugee camp on the Iraq Turkey border ....

The leader of the children is a youngster named Satelite since he is the only one for miles around that is able to install a satllite system and get a clear picture on the screen... To pay for food for his orphaned children followers he has them disarm land mines which he sells by the bag to buy food and other necessities ...

Of course the actors bpth young and old are unknowns but trust me they present us performaces that should make most academy award winners blush ....

The cinematography is great and the ONLY complaint I would have is that they only have English as subtitles ....",1131926400,5,780,4.440559440559441
2378153,5,B000A7LR82,"This 2004 Kurdish film is clearly the most disturbing film I have ever seen.  That's because it is about children who are victims of war.  It's set in Iraq, a few weeks before the American invasion which everyone knows is coming.  In fact, the people look forward to it because they all hate Saddam Hussein.  We get to meet a group of orphans who struggle to survive.  One of them is a 13 year old who is their leader.  Many of them are crippled.  Some have lost limbs from land mines.  And all have suffered emotional scars.

The young leader tries to encourage them and hold the group together and earn enough money to live.  What they do to earn money is to dismantle land mines which the leader then re-sells to the highest bidder.

Another aspect of the leader's character that is he attracted to a girl who carries a small boy of about 2 years old on her back.  The little boy cries a lot and wins our hearts..  We think it is her young brother but we soon find out differently.  Her real brother is also about 12 or 13 and he has no arms.  Somehow though, he manages to survive by dismantling land mines with his teeth and even carries around and tries to comfort the small crying little boy.

In a bit of comic relief, the old men of the town want to set up a satellite dish so they can watch the war news.  The 13-year old makes this purchase for them and they set it up in the mosque.  Of course nobody speaks any European language so they can't really understand what is going on.  But I had to smile as they accidentally discover ""forbidden"" channels with Western-style models in scanty clothes.

Eventually, the war does begin.  But life continues to be harsh.  And as the story continues, one of the children commits a terrible act against another child which brought tears to my eyes.  This is a story of survival.  It is also a story of hope.  But here dreams don't get realized and life continues in all its awful reality.

This is a fine film.  But it is guaranteed to leave you depressed and haunted by some terrible images.  I can only recommend it to a few with strong stomachs.  Be forewarned.",1131926400,10,2115,4.337595907928389
2378154,4,B000A7LR82,"""Turtles can Fly"" is a drama set in Kurdistan (on the Turkey-Iraq border) shortly before the Americans invade Iraq in 2003. Satellite is the ringleader of the refugee camp's hoards of orphaned children, who earn a meager living picking live landmines out of fields. Many are missing hands, arms, or legs. At the beginning of the film, the town's villagers are trying to install ancient antennas to catch word of when the war will begin, but Satellite rightly predicts that only a satellite dish will work for picking up foreign channels. Satellite's sidekick Pashow has lost a leg to the mines, and hobbles frantically behind Satellite, trying to keep up as he barks orders to assign his ""workers"" to new mine fields. The children sell the mines to arms dealers, who sell them to the UN.

We soon meet Agrin and Hengov, brother and sister, who are displaced and live in the refugee camp. Their parents were murdered by the Iraqi army, and tagging along with them is their little brother Riga, who, although blind, is a very intelligent, sensitive toddler. Hengov has lost both arms to a mine, and works alone, not talking to the other village and refugee children. It is said that he has the ability to predict the future. His beautiful, haunted, suicidal sister begrudgingly cares for Riga, who she lets wander away at night. Satellite is attracted to Agrin, attempting to impress her by carrying water for her, diving into a haunted pond to look for red fish, and telling her that he's been looking for a girl like her all his life, but she just walks away, back to the misery of her tent and her lot in life.

The war eventually reaches the town, and we see American troops rumbling through, but more and more tragedy occurs to the most defenseless: the children, living in mud-soaked, filthy camps, who spend their days picking through shell casings and unexploded land mines.

The ending is stark and powerful, and director Ghobadi blends mysticism with gritty realism, the young cast all non-professional actors. His distrust of the West is portrayed in scenes that show ""forbidden channels"" on the satellite, music videos and such from Germany, and the inaccurate reporting from CNN. When the village elders try to force Satellite to translate, he just says ""they're saying it will rain tomorrow,"" but later in the film, we find that he does know a bit of English and inadvertently teaches it to the other children.

This is a film full of disturbing images: violence, rape, maiming and suicide of children, so sensitive viewers beware. It is slow to start off, but is an ultimately rewarding journey of the horrors of war and the fate of the marginalized, orphaned children that war produces.",1129161600,21,2700,4.8125
2378155,3,B000A7LR82,"Turtles Can Fly is a film that could be described in a number of ways; extraorindary, insightful, a truly remarkable film. And it really is. I don't think I've ever seen a film with so much clarity of depth into the lives of Kurdish refugees, nestled in the hills outside Baghdad weeks before the war and leading up to it. The story of these orphaned children's lives as they risk life and limb to collect landmines in trade for weapons, and a satellite system for village elders, eager to hear of news of the oncoming war.

Unfortunately, my appreciation of the film is somewhat diminished. Yes, it's an amazing film. I'm not denying that. But my reaction to the film was of utter hopelessness and misery. This film made me feel miserable, not just for Satellite, Agrin, and the other characters. My response to it was misery. Watching Agrin attempt numerous times to kill herself or the young, orphaned child she entrusted to her care filled me with the same kind of feeling seeing Lord of the Flies for the first time did. I kept asking myself, where are the parents? The answer is all to obvious, and yet, the apocaplyptic atmosphere this movie imparts is unshakable. It's a very affecting film. It gets to you. I'd lavish Turtles Can Fly with more praise, but inwardly, it made me feel absolutely miserable. It's a drama in the most human sense, brutal, and honest.",1128902400,19,1370,4.637860082304527
