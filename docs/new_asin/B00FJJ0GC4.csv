8616086,4,B00FJJ0GC4,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2013 and directed by Marko Mkilaakso, Deadly Descent: The Abominable Snowman (aka Abominable Snowman and ""Yeti"") details events in the Washington Cascades after someone goes missing on Mount Glacier (Chuck Campbell) and his concerned sister (Lauren O'Neil) amasses a team to rescue him, utilizing the services of an alcoholic helicopter pilot (Adrian Paul). Unfortunately, their rescue effort is hindered by a couple of hulking, hairy beasts.

Being a TV movie that debuted on Syfy, you can expect cartoony CGI, not just for the ferocious creatures but other things as well (e.g. the helicopter and explosions). If you can handle that, this is a decent entry in the Big Foot/Yeti genre. The tone is serious, akin to Sasquatch Hunters (2005) and Sasquatch Mountain (2006), albeit taking place almost entirely on the peaks during winter. While its not quite as good as those two, its not far off.

The notable score has a reverent quality and Lauren ONeil shines as the female protagonist. The director doesnt fail to respectfully highlight her beauty. The mountain scenery is magnificent and theres quite a bit of thrilling ski & snowboarding sequences. The second act has the protagonists held up in an abandoned ski lodge on the heights.

The creatures, by the way, are never referred to as Yeti or the Abominable Snowman in the movie. The original title of the flick was ""Deadly Descent"" and the whole Yeti/Abominable Snowman element was added simply to market the movie. I'm sharing this for anyone who might complain that Yetis only dwell in the Himalayas, not the Cascades in the Pacific Northwest.

THE FILM RUNS 85 minutes and was shot in Bulgaria. WRITER: Nathan Atkins.

8616088,5,B00FJJ0GC4,"Let me start off by admitting that I am a horror / syfy channel / B-movie fanatic. I often prefer watching these movies rather than traditional Hollywood blockbusters. That being said, I am an avid syfy channel movie collector. Lately, I've been noticing that not all syfy movies that have aired on national t.v. have been released here in the United States. This movie, also known as abominable snowman, is one of those movies. This movie is unique in the way that they portray the yeti type creature as an intimidating looking bear hybrid, instead of the usual human / primate hybrid. It is tons of fun, and is well worth having in your collection. I strongly suggest buying a region free dvd player in order to watch movies like this that have never been released here in the U.S.",1453420800,,783,4.6
8616089,4,B00FJJ0GC4,"There are so many of these now, but most of them aren't worth watching except for the original with Forrest Tucker and Peter Cushing.  This version from Germany made in 2013 which I saw aired as the ""Abominable Snowman"" on the SyFy channel is a cut above most of them.  Thanks to decent acting, good sets, fairly good special effects, and above average screenplay it's worth viewing.",1448841600,,383,4.701492537313433
