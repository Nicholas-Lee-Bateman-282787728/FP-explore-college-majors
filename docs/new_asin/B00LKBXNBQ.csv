6488694,5,B00LKBXNBQ,"I had the opportunity to see 'The War Within' as an entry in the Christian Worldview Film Festival. It won four awards (Audience Choice, Best Feature Film, Best Gospel Presentation, and Best Trailer) for a very good reason. It's an outstanding film!

Many Christian films (I've seen countless) tend to suffer from the plague of lackluster scripts, poor production quality and bad acting, but you won't find any of that in 'The War Within'. This film is top notch in all respects, especially the extremely original script.

You can tell the filmmaker wasn't just interested in making an entertaining film (did that), but the focus was obviously to bring Glory to the Lord Jesus Christ and to reach out to the lost. The Gospel is seamlessly woven into the film and isn't one of those 'out of place' after thoughts. A lot of 'so-called' Christian films either present a weak 'watered-down' Gospel or no Gospel at all. That is not the case with 'The War Within'. Just seeing how the saving power of the Gospel is presented in such a clear unique way is worth the price of admission.

Click 'Add to Cart'.

When you get the film, sit down in front of the biggest television you can, press play, and prepare to watch a really creative storyline for the next 92 minutes. After watching the film, I think you'll agree that 'The War Within' is not only a very moving and entertaining film, but it's a film the Lord can use to bring lost souls to Himself. That's what really matters!

I just can't rate this film highly enough. It isn't one of those 'Watch Just Once' type of films because I know I'll watch it many times in the years to come. It would also make a great gift to give to lost friends and family members too. They may not want to darken the door of a church, but they'll get a clear Gospel message by watching this film. The story is so powerful and compelling, they'll want to watch it all the way through. Let's keep planting and watering those seeds!

A WARNING TO PARENTS: Although 'The War Within' has no objectionable material in it whatsoever, you'll need to watch it yourself (first) before having your preteen children watch it. There are some intense sequences that might be a little too much for them and only you can discern if your children are capable of handling those scenes.

May the Lord bless and use this film for His Glory!

POST DVD PURCHASE UPDATE:

You'll definitely want to do a 'Play All' of the 'Bonus Features'. They're almost as good as the film itself. Don't miss 'em!

This film is on my short list of 'Best Christian Films Of All-Time'. Its got a great script that presents the Gospel to the lost, edifies the Christian, and does it in an entertaining way with a very high production level to boot. That combination is a rarity in Christian films these days.

Even though 'The War Within' was just released, I'm already looking forward to the future efforts of 'House of Grace Films'. These guys are doing it right! I also wait patiently and hope they consider releasing 'The War Within' on Blu-ray, because it really deserves it.",1405641600,25,3125,4.663636363636364

6488698,4,B00LKBXNBQ,"*Spoiler Alert* This review is best read after watching the movie.

*Spoiler Alert* This review is best read after watching the movie: Good movie with a good message. What stands out most to me is the fact that if the accident had happened in America as portrayed in the movie, the parents would have likely faced criminal prosecution thanks to our draconian American traffic laws. Although the child only slipped her seatbelt off for a moment, the law would not be forgiving to the parents, and the driver rear-ended another vehicle. Parents are always responsible for the safety of a child according to the law and for whatever reason a driver who rear-ends another vehicle is almost always found at fault, no matter the circumstances. Very sadly, the accident resulted in a death that no doubt the parents would have been prosecuted for on top of losing their only child.",1511222400,,874,4.826666666666667

6488700,5,B00LKBXNBQ,"I enjoyed on how all the different clips they showed throughout the movie all made sense as the movie progressed and the full background was revealed. Yes, the inner battle parts may be a bit cheesy, but they portray the inner battle of a person in grief trying to sort out that with their faith. I too know the Good Shepard, and know of his redeeming love to be true. Good work!",1507766400,,379,4.277777777777778

6488703,3,B00LKBXNBQ,"I'm not religious, far from it, but I found this a very interesting portrayal of a man's turmoil in regaining his faith.  Yes, the costumes (not clothing) and effects were a bit cheesy but that's no doubt due to budget.  The metaphors they represented were on the mark.  Despite other reviewers, the actors were good, especially Varvel.  The story was obvious from the get go but well presented, although the dialogue was a tad stilted.  Recommend this as a good journey through the grief and angst that can result from a horrible occurrence and make one lose hope, confidence and conviction.  Well done.

Final note: I do however find it amusing that the inner conflict of this man was represented by magical combat.",1501545600,,717,4.780487804878049

6488706,1,B00LKBXNBQ,Interesting concept.. but the absolute worst acting and set design that I have ever seen... looked like a high school production. Everything about the movie... except for the concept... was SO bad that it was painful to watch.,1499817600,,226,4.973684210526316

6488708,5,B00LKBXNBQ,Thought it was corny at first but as I watched on it was actually really good. It really moved me and inspired me to connect all aspects of my being in my faith and bring to light some self-discoveries. Thank you for doing this. A real encouragement. Also helps with grief.,1498176000,,273,4.372549019607843

6488714,5,B00LKBXNBQ,"Beautifully written and made.  Be patient with it.  It is not a big budget but you begin to see many details that have been added to make it seem so.  The second half, for me, is where it took off.  Pure art!",1496448000,,208,3.880952380952381
6488715,1,B00LKBXNBQ,I couldn't even get through 20 minutes. I cannot believe people found this amazing!  The costumes were incredibly awful and cheesy along with the makeup.  The writing and acting was the worst I have come across in a very long time.  Just nothing appealing about it at all.  The reviews must be from the cast and crew.  Absolutely horrible movie.,1496275200,2,345,4.683333333333334

6488719,4,B00LKBXNBQ,"Very emotional, touching film about a faith filled man who thinks by being a believer everything will be okay. When it isn't. He becomes angry with God, throws bible and abandons his faith, thinking that it was ultimately led to the death of a family member. Interesting how we can blame so many things in life, including our faith, for the things that go wrong. What is UNUSUAL about this movies is that seldom do you see such hard truth in a movie. The hard truth that people of faith sometimes face. That they FALL. They BREAK. The pain is so deep, they crumble and begin to think that it's faith itself, God Himself that hates our guts and wants to destroy us. This is a huge lie that has deceived many of faith and NON faith into thinking God isn't real. Very unique movie. Not phony or fake. Shows real struggles. Really battles we have within.",1495929600,,850,4.420382165605096

6488724,5,B00LKBXNBQ,"Wow!! I had been passing by this movie for awhile on my prime account. I thought it was a new age type production based on the summary. But I watched the trailer and said ok looks like it's Christian based. Wow, wow, wow this was great!! One of the best Christian movies I have seen, not at all a typical take or route of a Christian movie. This was an excellent view of how the spiritual war just within ourselves ensues.

What a thought provoking movie and intriguing movie.  I would definitely recommend watching it.  I thought the acting was superb!  Great job, everyone, who participated in the making of this film.",1494633600,,327,4.568965517241379
6488733,5,B00LKBXNBQ,"I watched it with my siblings and my younger sister age 11 though it was the worst 2 hours she spent, (She had to be joking) when I told her she can leave whenever she wanted to she stayed and watched through the whole movie. Notably I would paused the film and would make comments every ten minutes, once I made us all do 20 pushups for everyone, and everyone tried to do 20.

 I really liked how thoughtful The War Within was, and how I can apply those allegory illustrations in my own life. I believe it is great that the movie is a story of Redemption, and where Love overcame with the help of memory, and continues. The actors did an excellent job, the production of the film felt low budget (still great filming, and corny special effects), but the moral, and the lesson you are left with makes it all the worth it:)",1494460800,,822,4.262820512820513

I thought that this was an excellent portrayal of what the some of the spiritual battle must be like as  we are torn between the world's view and the desires of God for our lives.

Alright then."" Then BOOM, you get the plot twist that knocks you off your seat and that's when the ride really begins. The War Within will make you think and feel A LOT.

6488742,4,B00LKBXNBQ,"I really want to give this movie a five star review because my wife and I enjoyed it a lot. The reason I'm giving it a four star review is because I think House of Grace Films is up and coming and there is still room for improvement in the filmmaking. The quality was good and the story was very moving, I think I even shed some tears at one point.

I think the movie does a good job of tackling the much needed and important subject of the thought life, and the struggle people go through in navigating what to do and how to respond in situations. I really really enjoyed the depth of the story, it highlighted important truths from Scripture and gives a good gospel message without being cheesy.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a very solid, Biblically sound, well-made, enjoyable-to-watch, Christian film. Well done House of Grace Films, I look forward to seeing more of your films in the future!",1493683200,,924,4.494047619047619

6488760,3,B00LKBXNBQ,"I liked this movie quite a bit, but it has some fairly serious flaws. Like others who have reviewed it, I agree that the production is impressive, especially considering the obviously modest budget. The main issues I have with it are two.

First, the main character is clearly seriously backslidden, but you don't really realize that until the film gets pretty far in. Perhaps it was just confusion on my part, but I kept expecting (and frankly, wanting) to see the positive and edifying effects in the soul of the main character seeking the Lord, such as from reading the Word or praying. However, you don't see any of this until the very end, when he finally has his repentance, ""wake up"" experience. If Christians were able to see the powerful effects on the soul of actively seeking God, the film could be so much more impactful. They clearly went for maximum emotion and drama, and they achieved that; but they lost a wonderful opportunity to edify viewers by showing them the profound effects of prayer, scripture reading, and/or biblical meditation on our mind, will, and emotions.

The second issue I have is that the Holy Spirit was seriously underrepresented in the ""soul"" of the main character. While we could needlessly argue that the Holy Spirit does not dwell within the soul of a person, the reality is that the Holy Spirit certainly interacts with, influences, and is influenced by the mind, will, emotions, memories, etc. of a born again believer. The Holy Spirit can be quenched and grieved by the thoughts and actions of a person, and the Holy Spirit can infuse life into a person's soul - love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, etc. It would have been wonderful (and far more accurate) to see the influence of the Holy Spirit in the main character's life instead of seeing hardly any influence of the Holy Spirit. (Even some portrayal of it being severely quenched and grieved would have been powerful.) I suppose one could argue that the Holy Spirit was already severely quenched and grieved in the main character's life, and that may indeed be so. That merely takes me back to my first point. I feel a great opportunity was missed to show how great our God is and how His power that lives within His adopted children can indeed lift us out of all kinds of fleshly/soulish troubles. I watched the ""making of"" extra feature on the DVD, and the film makers explained that the Holy Spirit was somehow represented by the mirror glass/water thing in one room. That's pretty disappointing in terms of seeing how powerfully the Holy Spirit can work inside a believer; but again, perhaps the excuse is that the main character was too backslidden for much operation of the Holy Spirit.

I was really impressed by the creativity of the theme of this movie. I also greatly appreciate the ""cleanness"" of the film. There's no profanity, the violence is pretty tame and appropriate (and non-bloody), and the non-married lead actor and actress never kiss on the lips - a rare bit of restraint! I'm just disappointed that such important opportunities for edification of the Body of Christ were missed. The film makers seemed to view their movie predominantly as an evangelistic tool. I find that odd, since the primary theme deals with the internal battle inside the soul of a man who is already born again. True, his wife experiences conversion, and that is indeed powerful; but again, I feel there is some confusion as to the *Christian* purpose behind the film. And I feel a great opportunity for edification of the Church was missed.

I highly recommend this movie and will share it with family.",1423353600,,176,4.205882352941177
6488762,4,B00LKBXNBQ,"I absolutely love this movie. I have watched it over and over and over....and over again. This copy was purchased as a Christmas gift, because it is worth others watching. Great depiction of internal struggles!  I would rate the contents/topic of the movie 5 stars, must see! Only rated as 4 stars because the acting won't get any awards. But seriously, the lack of top notch acting is no reason to pass this movie up. Great, great, great movie!!!",1421107200,,447,4.658227848101266

1) Audience Choice
2) Best Feature
3) Best Film Trailer
4) Best Gospel Presentation

This is one you don't want to miss!",1411689600,6,231,4.325581395348837
6488771,5,B00LKBXNBQ,"Upon viewing the trailer, my first thought was skepticism.  My husband/pastor and I rented the movie online and watched it.  We were awestruck as we clearly understood our internal spiritual struggles i.e., the flesh vs. the Spirit.  This is a must-see movie.  I don't understand why this movie never hit the big screen theaters (if it did, we missed it).  This movie should be seen at the theaters by saved and unsaved individuals.  We ordered it on DVD.  Preferred it on Blu-ray.  The special effects, costumes, and moreover the acting by all characters was phenomenal.  The Lord Jesus blessed this production.  We also order The Board.  We are anticipating the arrival of our DVDs.  We would like to obtain licensure to show this movie at church.  I would suggest pastors/clergy to do likewise and invite everyone both saved and unsaved to see this production.  Keep up the good work and please make more films.  Thank you and God bless!

6488774,5,B00LKBXNBQ,"Wow! This movie is incredibly well done and full of powerful truths. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone! This is one of the best Christian films that has been made. I look forward to sharing it with friends and family, both believers and non-believers. It is a movie that is enjoyable, challenging and inspiring! The story is amazing and the quality is excellent.

8666289,5,B00LKBXNBQ,"Wow. After I got over my initial annoyance with the female Christian romance interest's toothy smiles in every introductory scene, and the fact that she's a school teacher (please, not again!) I found myself delightfully lost in a weirdly wonderful sick-dream of Skyrim meets psychiatry and Spiritual Warfare and... and.... Wow! Truly unique and riveting from thereon in. The climax features divine synchronicity at its finest. This film begs the question - WHEN will a Christian video game featuring Spiritual Warfare be made? Now THAT would be something to look forward to my XBOX One! EMOTION did a great job! At first I thought a higher budget in the ""battle"" scenes would have made them more effective, but then I realized the opposite was true, because then the profound sense of humor would have been lost and, paradoxically, mysteriously undermined the deadly seriousness of what goes on inside us. Perfectly imperfect, and instead of petering out at the end, it climaxes in a totally real and breathtaking way.",1528588800,,1019,5.071428571428571
