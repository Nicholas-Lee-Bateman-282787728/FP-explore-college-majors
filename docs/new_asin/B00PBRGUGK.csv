8687330,5,B00PBRGUGK,"This is a well done DVD. I really like Mrs. Harrison-Tustain's style of painting. I learned a great deal from watching this. I have painted in oils and over glaze porcelain paints for many years. I like control and detail in my painting. I have always shied away from watercolors because of this. Her technique is something I can do, and be happy. My only complaint is that the volume is so low it is difficult to hear. I plan to purchase her other DVDs. They are well worth it.",1498435200,,478,4.322222222222222

8687333,5,B00PBRGUGK,I have just had the pleasure of watching this wonderful high quality DVD. I already own three of her previous DVD's and she certainly lives up to her high standards with this newest one. This is a very professionally done DVD with excellent production quality and attention to detail making it easy to see and follow all of Susan's instructions. Again in this DVD Susan holds back nothing in sharing her techniques and talents with the rest of us.  She has a real gift for teaching and it is quickly obvious that her goal is not to show us what she is capable of but what we are capable of by following her techniques and advice.  There is a great deal of in depth information available on this DVD all presented in an easy to understand format. Watching her point out and explain the 5 Crucial Elements for a Successful Painting showed me immediately where I had been making my mistakes and how to bring my paintings up to the next level by paying attention to these 5 elements. There is information here for every level of artist from beginner to advanced.  This is a DVD that you will be very happy that you purchased and will become a reference source that you will use on an ongoing basis. I highly recommend this DVD and definitely give it five stars!!,1418774400,13,1258,4.460869565217391
