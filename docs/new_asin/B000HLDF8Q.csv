8140281,5,B000HLDF8Q,"I agree with the first reviewer.  This was a fun movie to watch.  It is clear that the narrator, Mickey Rooney, loved the 30s.  The images are OK, the sound reasonable, particularly if one considers how old the source material is.  Some of the excerpts have appeared in other compendiums, but many are seen here for the first time.  Watching this DVD is a great way to spend an hour and a half.  In my case, however, it was three hours since as soon as it was over, I watched it again.  If you have any interest in this period of film making this DVD is lots of fun.",1328400000,,566,4.137614678899083
