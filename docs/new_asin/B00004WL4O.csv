8155582,2,B00004WL4O,"'Angel and the Badman' is one of my favorite John Wayne films and 'Blue Steel' has an okay storyline that includes Gabby Hayes, but these two film copies by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment are neither ""SUPERB"" nor ""excellent"" as indicated in other reviews. I've previously owned 'Angel and the Badman' and this copy is not only an inferior one (dark and splotchy), but has various small parts chopped or cut out completely. 'Blue Steel' is an okay copy for 1934, but the audio quality is mediocre. Find better copies from another studio to truly enjoy these Duke films, or just watch them online.",1514678400,,595,4.786407766990291
8155583,5,B00004WL4O,"If you want decent quality from a couple of  Wayne's old westerns, this is a good buy. Not only  is it a good buy but they are two good B-Westerns!",1291248000,,147,3.8666666666666667
8155584,5,B00004WL4O,No one does it better than the Duke...! What a great mix of films... Angel & the Badman is an all time Classic Cowboy from the Duke's middle career and Blue Steel is a perfect example of his very early career... if you are a John Wayne fan it really is fun to see how not only movies changed but how he changed. The print of Angel and the Badman is absolutely SUPERB and Blue Steel is pretty darn good considering its age. This DVD is an excellent bargain and I highly recommend it to fans.,1063238400,5,490,4.114583333333333
8155585,5,B00004WL4O,It was a kick seeing John Wayne as a very young man in Blue Steel. I love old flicks and this one is nicely preserved by Marengo Films... there are the obvious small flaws in these older films but I appreciate the way that Marengo has cleaned the sound.  I rate both film prints as excellent and the conversion to DVD will certainly preserve these two classics... Buy this one for your library... and bring on the popcorn.,981849600,10,422,4.410256410256411
