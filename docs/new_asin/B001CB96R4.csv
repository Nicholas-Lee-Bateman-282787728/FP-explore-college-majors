8286438,5,B001CB96R4,This video has helped me gain and maintain a strong core. It's amazing for my back pain and has strengthened my entire body. I wish there were more Sharon Mann videos available because the workout is so enjoyable you want to keep doing it day after day.,1477526400,,253,4.404255319148936
8286439,5,B001CB96R4,"Best home workout option EVER. This is not my first copy and it carries me from ultra beginner (when I've fallen off the exercise wagon for months at a time) to experienced challenge (after months of everyday use). You will not be sorry, and if you actually do it you will see/feel results. Buy two because you will be sorry if it does and you can no longer find it online!",1449273600,,373,4.267605633802817
8286440,5,B001CB96R4,"I had her show off the fitness channel recorded and they gave us new equipment so it was gone. I love this one also but hope she makes a new one with different yoga/Pilates .. I have lost 33 lbs and am 3/4 inch taller. Have ""shaped up with Sharon for 5 years.",1408665600,,259,3.9056603773584904
8286441,5,B001CB96R4,"As I have been practicing yoga nearly 3 years pretty regularly, both with and without studio influence on my practice, I have had the opportunity to study a little pilates with a now-great teacher. This DVD does NOT fuse the two disciplines into a kind of Yog-a-lates; but that is necessary in this case. Sharon (with the help of her class) is an excellent and mindful yogini who knows a lot of asana, at least; but the pilates segment is where she really is in her element. Traditional mat pilates that really delivers, and makes me miss my old pilates class. Y-ouch!",1266883200,4,568,4.578431372549019
8286442,5,B001CB96R4,The item was new.  It arrived in plenty of time.  Over all I was very pleased.,1262822400,,78,3.8125
8286443,5,B001CB96R4,"This program is very simple Yoga & Pilates exercise. However, looking at her
""Downward-Facing Dog"" pose, you will realize that her physical prowess is very high. If you follow this lesson, you will be able to have strong core.",1235174400,4,226,4.82051282051282
8286444,4,B001CB96R4,"I really like this dvd. Sharon Mann is always really enthusiastic, and makes you feel like you are a superstar even if you are having trouble with the moves. I love the yoga portion of the video for relaxing & stretching my body, and the pilates portion has some great ab exercises that make me feel like I'm actually working out my muscles. Actually, I've used this dvd so often that it's completely scratched, & I'll probably have to buy a new one pretty soon!",1207267200,,462,4.447058823529412
