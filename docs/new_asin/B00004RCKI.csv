1341677,5,B00004RCKI,"""Once Were Warriors"" is a unique and marvelous film.  Gritty, scary but thoroughly believable.

The film is set in the tough suburbs of south Auckland amidst a sea of social dysfunction.  Yet in this sea, there are some individuals who shine however briefly.  There are others who simply flounder.

There are magnificent performances by Rena Owen who plays the role of Beth Heke and Temeura Morrison who plays her brutal husband Jake ""the Muss"" Heke.  These two actors are great!  See the film if only to see the characters that they have created.

When seeing this film, do not expect to be uplifted.  It is bleak and often terrifying.  It is also very realistic.  Social dysfunction is rarely pleasant.  This film is not the dross of Hollywood but a real world with real people and real problems.

If you see no other film this year, see ""Once Were Warriors"".",1092355200,4,861,4.697986577181208
1341678,5,B00004RCKI,"ONCE WERE WARRIORS is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen.  Released at a time when NZ films weren't widely accepted, yet when audiences saw it ... they changed their minds.  This was the most talked about film in Australia in 1994.  It's one of those rare movies that made me cry.
Incredible performances from both male and female leads which contribute to the powerfulness of this film.  The sequel from 1998 called ""What Becomes of the Broken Hearted"" is worth seeing, but not a patch on ONCE WERE WARRIORS.
Buy it, rent it, or whatever ... just get yourself a copy.  You must have this DVD in your collection.",1077148800,2,625,4.495575221238938
1341679,5,B00004RCKI,"I've just had the opportunity of witnessing this film for the very first time and now understand why it received the great reviews that it has---especially in reference to the performances of Tem Morrison and Rena Owen. Two beautiful and magnetic performers who breathe life and great depth into the troubled world of Jake and Beth Heke. This is one of those rare gems of a movie one usually discovers only through word of mouth as it contrasts greatly from the sort of tripe that Hollywood churns out every summer that's meant to appeal to teenagers and separate them from their hard earned cash working lousy summer jobs.
I was amazed in observing that, although the story centers on the cultural loss and disenfranchisement of a Maori family living in the slums of Auckland, New Zealand, anyone can quickly identify with its universal themes of domestic abuse, hoplessness and the consequences of what can happen when a community becomes a victim of ill conceived ""social welfare"" programs and the vicious circle of dependency that accompanies it.
The opening scene is priceless and unforgettable as director Lee Tamahori stamps an indelible impression of a beautiful, picturesque backdrop of New Zealand that tourists usually see in travel guides--only to have the camera gradually pull away to reveal that the scenic natural beauty is only a billboard set high above a noisy freeway amidst the slums of South Auckland. This is just the beginning as the story proceeds to take you on an emotional rollercoaster ride that doesn't let up on your senses.
The film also features a great supporting cast as well, most notably, from Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell who gives a touching and poignant performance as young Grace Heke, the family's one shining light amidst all the darkness that covers their lives. Her portrayal makes you want to reach out to the screen and ultimately help and save this young soul---that's how affecting her performance was. Why isn't Mamaengaroa an international star by now? Also, the amazing Cliff Curtis who can play so many diverse characters has a short, but crucial role in the movie.
While the very uplifting and highly enjoyable film Whale Rider shows you one aspect of Maori life, Once Were Warriors brings you the unflinching and graphic urban realism of the other. Run, don't walk to your nearest video store and buy this movie. It's that good!",1076198400,4,2376,4.972361809045226
1341680,5,B00004RCKI,"This is one of the most moving and yet inspirational films I have seen. Set in the Government Housing area of Aukland,New Zealand (Aotearoa). while much of other reviews covers the simple view of the film, they cannot convey the powerful story/message as well as watching Rena Owen and Temuera Morrison, Taungaroa Emile, Mere Boynton and  Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell, and the rest of the cast.
The Film highlights not only the Maori story, but as mentioned by Rene herself (in an interview on the DVD I have). it highlights the problems of women children and men worldwide, most people can relate to the characters, many of us know a Beth Heke, a  Boogie Heke, a Jake (The Mus) Heke, even a Grace Heke.
they need not be Maori, but we all can relate, no matter our origins, this is a story of the human condition that is all too common, and in the eyes of this reviewer, shows that too often when we try to be strong, we get it wrong. if you like Hollywood's greatest, then don't get this film, because this film is not a flight of fantasy, this film is reality.",1068249600,,1055,4.461139896373057

This is one of my favorite films and as a filmmaker, I appreciate watching films (especially older ones) in the highest quality possible. That's why I purchased this Blu-ray disc to watch in my home theatre. Much to my disappointment, after the copyright and icon home entertainment bumpers play, the disc stops and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. You can't skip or go to the root menu. Having once owned this in VHS in the 90's I was so excited to watch this in blu-ray with a theatre 16:9 experience. So bumbed!

Adding to my dissatisfaction, there isn't any post house or distributers manufacturing this film in blu-ray. I would love to bust a ""Jake The Muss"" on whoever's ass that authored this disc!!!! It was probably burned on somebody's laptop!",1442448000,2,844,4.626666666666667

1341764,4,B00004RCKI,The book gives an insight in the complex problems many Maoris have to face in modern New Zealand and tries to point out the underlying causes. It tells us that playing the role of victim and just blaming the white people does not bring forward a positive change. Returning to the old strong values of the Maori culture can help to overcome the disasters of the last centuries.

The scene with the mom finding Grace was... so horrifying I literally found myself covering my ears. The absolute devastation and agony heard in that voice is not something I will soon forget. It was too painful to watch, too painful to hear, too painful to even  witness. You don't find acting like that in movies today.

When he's sweet, he is very sweet, but his fuse is short, and it is more important that he maintain the respect of his mates than of his wife and five kids.  When he is violent, he is very violent... to strangers and to his family.

This film is in the genre of ones that lay bare the underbelly of cultures that have been, to a great extent, left behind by the economic, social, political, and educational systems of the ""western world.""  In this case. the film hints at a devastated Maori culture, transformed from a nation of warriors to a splintered group of haves and have nots.  The have nots are featured in Once Were Warriors, and it is not a pretty picture.

Similar stories could be told in Chicago, or Los Angeles, or Cleveland.  Once Were Warriors focuses on the intersection of poverty, alcohol, and race.

Could Once Were Warriors really compete? And could it top them all?

Well, the answer is: yes, it competes. We still consider The Piano a better-made film, and we enjoyed it more, but Once Were Warriors is an important film, with a stark, heartbreaking look at a little-known demographic: the modern M'aori community. Indeed, it is because of its content that Once Were Warriors is so good.

Essentially a typical Dickensian tale of poor families with evil fathers, it takes place in and around the run-down home of the Heke family. Father Jake (Temuera Morrison, i.e. Jango Fett) is a violent, sexual, hard-drinking man who's recently been laid off. He holds wife, Beth (Rena Owen), in a high-intensity love/hate affair filled with extreme swings of abuse and seduction. Meanwhile, their five children are struggling to keep it all together, each in their own way. Eldest son Nig (Julian Arahanga) has recently joined a Maori gang, while second son Boogie (Taungaroa Emile) is arrested for a petty crime and put into a boy's home. Daughter Grace (Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell) is the family's peacemaker and solid core: she cares deeply for her siblings and goes to great lengths to protect them, especially in the moments when their mother can't.

The film is brutal and brief (only 99 minutes), and it's also very straightforward. Much of the dialogue, family dynamics and plot points are well-worn clichs in the genre of the Hardcore Troubled Working Class Home Life Film. Indeed, so inured are we to these staples that our emotional reactions were often quite muted - more muted than they should have been, given how awful some of the scenes were. (And, importantly, even if it's a clich in film, that doesn't mean it doesn't happen in real life.) The filmmaking style was also blunt, even at times sledgehammery: a quick cut from Jake beating Beth to a snarling dog hunting through scraps, a mother's tormented wail fading into the shriek of a passing ambulance's siren. This is a far cry from, for example,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Guide-to-Recognizing-Your-Saints/dp/B000KB489I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints</a>, which takes an equally tired tale - except this time set in the Bronx - and, through nuance and post-modern presentation, makes it fresh and new. Once Were Warriors' freshness lies almost entirely in the uniqueness of the context (as we said): the modern Maori community in New Zealand.

Indeed, the links back to M'aori culture and community had the strongest effect on us: the electrifying scenes of Boogie learning to do the haka, Beth's nostalgic memories of life in the traditional community, the scenes where Nig joins the gang and emerges with his new facial tattoos. These moments were beautiful and very affecting.

On the one hand, the film could be about any family anywhere suffering from alcoholism, poverty and domestic abuse - taken that way, the film fails to make much of an impact, with poor writing and shaky acting. But on the other hand, the film is an incisive look into how modernization, colonization and globalization affect traditional cultural practices: in particular, what it means to be M'aori in the 21st century. Taken that way, the film is a powerful and heartbreaking portrayal. Given also that Pacific island cultures are terribly underrepresented in modern filmmaking, Once Were Warriors is that much more significant.

However, it is not a ""nice"" film and is by no means sugar coated.  This film is a realistic movie about the problems the Maori culture encounters on a day to day basis and the family problems they encounter.  I strongly recommend this film.",1224115200,,399,4.739130434782608
1341821,5,B00004RCKI,"This movie, impressively, describes the daily reality of a Maori family in New Zealand and puts a stop straight away to any romantic myths one might harbor considering the Maori people. This is perfectly illustrated with the opening shot in which we look at a beautiful landscape with a sun soaked lake, marvelous trees and hills. The camera however moves back somewhat and reality sets in: we were looking at a bill board and as a matter of fact we find ourselves near a highway winding itself through the slums of Auckland, New Zealand.

Its director, Lee Tamahori weaves, in a truly unforgettable way, the torturous existence of the Heke family, a tapestry of which the strains have been dyed in blood, sweat and tears, even though in some spots specks of sunlight can be noticed, but the chain of dramatic events that lead to a tragic unraveling, prove unstoppable.

Tamahori is far from gentle with the audience and the impact of the at times extremely violent scenes at times hit with the force of a sledge hammer. These images show a family trapped in social-economic hopelessness, to which the only escape seems to be through alcohol and/or sexual abuse and fortunately, every once in a while, a beautiful song. As head of the family, Jake, magnificently portrayed by Temuera Morrison, in this sense also takes the lead through physical violence in what he considers maintaining his pride in a world that will not allow him any otherwise. As these attempts fail on a regular basis, he takes out his frustration and subsequent rage on his family, especially his wife, an equally impressive portrayal by Rena Owen, who seems to be the victim but in the end is the only one maintaining her dignity and pride.

When we first meet this family, it's clear it has been suffering under these circumstances for years, causing family ties to be strenuous to say the least, if they haven't already been irreparably damaged as they are between Jake and both his sons Nig, Sonny (who we only meet in the sequel to this movie ""What becomes of the broken hearted"") and young Mark.
Their mother already has a hard time making ends meet, so the children are mostly left to their own devices.

Dramatic events follow, mostly ensuing from Jake's violent nature and selfishness, until a climactic event becomes the turning point in the movie and the lives of all involved will change definitively and will also be engraved in the viewer's soul.",1221523200,,2432,4.783333333333333
1341822,5,B00004RCKI,"Looking for a good foreign film?  Try this one.  This gives us a view into the world of Maori culture, the indigenous people of New Zealand.  It's a very disturbing story with a lot of violence toward women.

The story focuses on a woman who's in a marriage to an abusive alcoholic man.  Her son is troubled and constantly getting in trouble with the law.  Her oldest daughter tries her best to make something of herself but given the environment, there's only but so much she can do.  Unfortuanately, this kind of story is being played out every day all around the world.

We may see the woman in this story as strong and somewhat of a hero, but the harsh reality is that by the time she tries to make a change for the better, the damage had already been done.",1219795200,,761,4.309859154929577
1341823,5,B00004RCKI,"""Once Were Warriors"" is a powerful tale of what it is like, to be treated as a stranger on your own land. It gives an intimate look of a people who have not quite shaken off their warrior roots, living in a society that rewards civility.

SPOILER ALERT!  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X

Temuera Morrison and Rena Owen play Jake and Beth Heke, Parents of five, trying to make a go, if Jake were a little more responsible toward his familial duties. He also has a ""hair-trigger"" temper, along with a sizable alcohol problem, and as we all know, they don't go well together.
This is a family in deep crisis. The eldest son Nig, has joined a gang (a sort of throwback to their warrior roots). Their middle son ""Boogie"", seems unable to stay clear of trouble either, being picked-up by Police in the company of real delinquents. Their eldest daughter Grace, is a shy, quiet, introverted girl, thoughtful and kind to her siblings. For some reason, we don't see much of their two youngest, and only one of them has a couple of lines in the film.

Jake has an unhealthy penchant for partying and drinking (one wonders how he can afford this, as he is on the Dole), inviting his drinking buddies over to his house, with no concern towards his children. Beth is really no better, as she allows this sort of thing, and you get the sense that it has been going on for quite some time. We are witness to Jake giving Beth a ""beatdown"", for not cooking for one of his buddies, and the aftermath, which shows how little regret Jake has for his actions. It seems that Jake's routine is no more than sleeping, drinking, fighting, partying,  beating on his wife, and bullying his children.

When Boogie is remanded to State Custody, Beth wants to visit him, and because of a gambling windfall, Jake comes up with the money to make it possible, but on the appointed day, Jake would rather get drunk, than see his own son. During one of Jake's parties, Grace is raped by one of Jakes ""mates"", ""Uncle Bully"" (Clifford Curtis). Finding no solace within her family or friends, she commits suicide.

The cauldron boils over, as Beth is determined to take Grace's body back to her tribal land, to be buried with her people. Jake resents this, but Beth will not be swayed. After the burial, Beth discovers that Grace was raped, after reading Grace's journal/diary, by Uncle Bully. Beth goes to Jake's favorite Bar, and confronts them. It is here, that Jake shows SOME concern, and beats down Bully in a scene that makes one wonder how Clifford Curtis wasn't injured in the filming of it.

""Once Were Warriors"" became a hands-down favorite in New Zealand, out doing other ""Blockbuster"" films, upon it's initial release. There's no wonder as to why. It is an intimate look at a people at war with themselves, trying to make sense of a world they had no hand in creating.

1341824,5,B00004RCKI,This is one of my all time favorite movies. It really brings to light how when a people lose their culture (or have it taken from them) they also lose selfworth.,1206489600,,161,4.225806451612903
1341825,4,B00004RCKI,"Once Were Warriors is a look inside a Maori family's daily life of fighting, loving, and living.  It's a view for outsiders of a proud culture and history, where men were once literally tattood, intimidating warriors capable of warding off even the most difficult adversary.

The father of the family is Jake The Muss (Temuera Morrison), a belligerent, incredibly insecure drunk, who compensates by laying the beat down on anyone in his way.  He descends from a long line of slaves, and that chip on his shoulder causes the aggression.  It isn't abnormal for him to randomly walk up to a stranger at his local pub and nearly beat him into a coma.  Unfortunately for his family, they're often on the undercard for the fight.

Jake's wife, Beth (Rena Owen), is the backbone of the family, the true matriarch through which all struggles are either amplified or lessened.  While far from a good mother, especially with one kid in a gang and one on the way to a juvenile home for Maoris, she's at least the one who comforts and shows love, and ultimately cares about her children's well-being.

Her strength, however, leads to confrontations with Jake, who definitely doesn't like to be challenged.  And when the couple decides to have regular drinking parties at their house, inviting a large group of friends for loud singing and drunken debauchery, the violence is much more prevalent.

Eventually, the story moves along and the family deals with the struggles of domestic abuse, alcoholism, irresponsibility, detachment, rape, and separation.  It's quite a roller coaster ride after a somewhat slow beginning.  It's complete madness at times, but overcoming the daily problems eventually leads to triump, and a return to a proud way of life.

The one downside to this movie is the production value.  It's clear that the budget wasn't very large, and it's quite good for what was available.  The acting is top notch, however, and for the most part, overcomes any production shortcomings.",1203292800,,1985,4.954682779456193

1341829,5,B00004RCKI,"In reading reviews on Once Were Warriors, most written by Americans, I fear that many believe this to be a true depiction of Maori life in NZ.
However, whilst this film shows a gritty, dirty, dangerous side to Maori culture in NZ it is not the kind of life that all Maori lead.  I have numerous Maori friends, among them a doctor, a lawyer, a sales executive and hard working tradesmen, who value their family among all else.  Please know that although this film does portray a kind of gangland you would see in South Central LA it is not the kind of life most Maori lead. In saying that, I do not wish to take away from that fact that the scenes shown in this film are a reality for many Maori too...and this kind of poverty and gang violence is an ongoing issue in NZ. What I like about the film is that it shows the kind of poverty and socio-economic problems evident in ALL societies - a common theme in all countries that is not solely about race.

Also VERY useful in promoting insight in even the most reluctant of batterers. A powerful tool and a ""must see"" for clients - but clinicians need to use judgement regarding client's capacity to view such realistic portrayals of violence and destruction within the family unit.",1184803200,2,754,5.452991452991453

With its jarring realism and uniformly excellent performances, Tamahori's film throbs with anger, bitterness, and cruelty, creating a portrait of societal alienation that feels authentic. In addition to Owen's searing portrayal of Beth, Julian Arahanga gives a sharp performance as eldest son Julian, who joins a vicious Maori street gang after disowning his father, played with unnerving force by Morrison. Based on a novel by Alan Duff, ""Warriors"" is an honest and ultimately cathartic look at finding pride in the midst of crushing hopelessness.",1184284800,5,704,5.467889908256881

The abuse suffered at the father's hand and the mother's acceptance as if the norm was disturbing, yet, real... too real.
It was hard to see the father attempt to redeem his family through violence. He was so very violent and warped it was painful to watch.

1341848,5,B00004RCKI,"I have seen this movie over a month ago and have wanted to write a review of it ten minutes into beginning the movie. Alas, I never found the words to perfectly describe the movie's beauty and power. Because really this movie is beyond words and beyond moving pictures.

Once Were Warriors is a movie about a poor Maori family. Jake is unemployed and is also an alcoholic. His wife doesn't work and his children are heading straight for the life of crime and no future. A suicide in the family forces the family to reevaluate their culture, their friends and their complacency. (I am aware that I am being vague, but I have opted to do so, because I believe that the viewer is entitled to know as little about the plot as posssible preceding the viewing. Read another review for more plot).

Before watching this film, I hadn't the slightest clue as to what it was about. The beginning didn't give me too many hints either, but it could have gone in a thousand directions. The first half of the movie shows us the disintegration of the family. One son is sent to a Maori boarding school where he learns about his culture, another is initiated into a Maori street gang with tatoos on their faces just like those worn by traditional Maori warriors, the Mother gets beaten, and the daughter finds no place to go.

About halfway through this movie, I had a dirty t-shirt in my hand and began to wipe the tears from my face with it every few seconds. My roomates were in the room and I was doing everything in my power to hide my emotions, but alas they probably leaked out (quite literally). As an 18 year old male, I seldom cry while  watching films. Instead I typically laugh at the emotional scenes ,while everyone else has a tissue to their face. For some reason, Once Were Warriors managed to break down my defences and open the floodgates. It wasn't that the act itself was so horrible, there are many movies with far worse instances of abuse and hopelessness, but somehow the presentation of the suicide transcended any presentation of a death that I have ever seen before.

So far, I have only gotten halfway through the film... but the movie keeps improving from there. The decisions made by Jake's wife and his son Nig reflect true and utter power and conviction. Each scene was acted out to its utter potential, each line (especially the line ""once were warriors"") reflects true and pure emotion of the characters, actually, I'll call them people because they were nothing short of it.

I could write a thousand essays on this movie, analyzing each action and each subtext, but alas, I will just suggest that everyone see this movie, for it is more than just watching a film is a literal experience in the brutality and reality of the life of a family. Watch it alone with a clear mind and I am sure that any viewer will be able to experience the movies sheer intensity.",1135900800,10,2877,4.523076923076923

As a New Zealander I can say this movie is a real depiction of the lives of some families in New Zealand.  The actors are brilliant, many are familiar to me from local TV and films, but in this movie any preconceptions about the actors are brushed aside -they play their parts so well and so powerfully.  Rena Owen (who plays the mother Beth ""Fry-your-own-f'n-eggs"" Heke) even took it to real life, a year after the film came out she was convicted and discharged for clubbing someone on the head with a pool cue at her local pub!

The violence, both at home and at the pub; the sexual abuse, the beatings and gang depictions -it all adds up to what could be a very depressing movie.  But there is mercifully light at the end of the tunnel.

1341853,5,B00004RCKI,"I had seen ""Once Were Warriors"" after the publicity and hype here, and for that reason, I was fairly well prepared for the movie itself. In some ways, despite this, the movie did present surprising elements and messages that were not so well publicised in the media.

Focusing on a troubled family of urban Maori, the story revolves around the Heke family, with the mother battling to keep things together in the face of the violence and rage of her husband, Jake ""The Muss"" Heke.

With an emphasis on heritage and who people really are, the movie goes beyond the shocking violence, and gives hope of something better. It is a surprisingly positive movie, that presents tragedy as a catalyst for positive change. It is in the midst of loss and misfortune that people find themselves and are moved to something better. Of course, Jake provides the counter-point of attempting to deal with it in his own violent way, as he has done throughout the movie.

With supreme performances from Temuera Morrison, Rena Owen, Cliff Curtis and many others, Lee Tamahori has directed a masterpiece of a movie. Violent, brutal, and honest, the movie also gives a profound message of hope and self-knowledge. Take the tissues, but also be prepared to be spoken to at a deep level.

1341855,5,B00004RCKI,"As you can see from my rating, I also feel that this is an excellent movie.  I just wanted to clear up one fact from a previous review so as to give two excellent Maori actors their dues.  Temuera Morrison played Jake ""the Muss"" Heke in OWW.  Ironically, it was this critically acclaimed performance which brought him to the attention of Hollywood where he was later to play alongside Pamela Anderson in ""Barbed Wire"", Marlon Brando in ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"", he was also a main character in ""Speed 2"" and more recently as Jango Fett in the Star Wars prequels.

Not to take away from Tem's incredible performance in OWW, but the contrast of the ""somewhat soft son in 'Whale Rider'"", doesn't work because that part was played by another talented Maori actor - Cliff Curtis.  He also had a role in OWW; that of Uncle Bully.  His performance has also led to a career in Hollywood playing various minorities - the drug dealing hispanic in ""Bringing Out the Dead"", the Central American terrorist in ""Collateral Damage"", and plenty of Middle Eastern characters (""Three Kings"", ""The Majestic"", etc.)

It's a pity that a wider audience isn't given the opportunity to see these guys in roles that really showcase their acting chops.  Still, at least they have careers (such as they are).  There are plenty of talented actors out there whose closest shot at fame has been being a waiter in Hollywood.",1119225600,3,1394,4.703703703703703
1341856,5,B00004RCKI,"Gripping, heartfelt drama about a dysfunctional Maori family struggling for survival in the government provided urban housing project (i.e. slums) of New Zealand. This is a violent, hardhitting film. Fortunately the story ultimately transcends the violence and offers some hope for a brighter tomorrow. 'Once Were Warriors' is a story of reconnecting with one's heritage and rediscovering who you are and what you can become.

Three other excellent movies dealing with the same theme of failed assimilation and destruction of indigenous cultures are: 'Where the Green Ants Dream', 'The Fringe Dwellers' (DVD - Region 4 only) and 'Rabbit-Proof Fence.' All three are Australian films dealing with the plight of the Aborigine.

I would also recommend Emerald Forest (DVD) which deals with tribes living within the tropical rainforests of South America.",1113782400,50,849,5.523076923076923
1341857,5,B00004RCKI,"I worked in a home for teenage boys who had substance abuse problems, I wanted to show this film to them. Other counselors were strongly opposed to this idea. I chose to show it anyway, with a thourough warning and disclaimer to the kids about the intensity level and violence. I showed them this film and they were totally entranced by it, it provoked emotional responses from boys who have had to construct a wall of toughness around them to deal with their situations.

After the film we had one of the most intense and active discussions I have ever had with teenage boys. They saw elements of their own lives in this film and it allowed them to open up about the difficulties they faced. One guy even revealed something that he has never had the courage to reveal about his personal situation. True art elicits true emotions.

I can not give high enough praises for all those involved in the production of this film.",1112918400,25,921,4.542168674698795
1341858,5,B00004RCKI,"I don't know where to start. This is one of the finest movies I've ever seen, and I've seen countless numbers. Once Were Warriors is, at its most stripped, about a woman named Beth and her struggle to just do what's best for her family. She is of Maori heritage, New Zealand's sort of Native Americans. Culture is a proud and powerful aspect of the movie, as Beth's strengths lie in her devotion to her family and her heritage. But that is little comfort, as her daughter is struggling to accept adulthood, her youngest son is heading towards juvenile detention, and her oldest son is fast on his way to joining a brutal gang. Worst of all, her husband Jake is a heavy drinker.

The film excels at painting everybody in full 3 dimensions as they just do what they can to find their place. The gang is cruel to the oldest son, but at the same time embraces him. The juvenile detention center separates the youngest son from his only home, but instills in him a pride in his ancestry. And Jake himself is a beast, a man built like a tank who will destroy you with anything available should you spill his beer...but somehow he also comes across as loving Beth. Sometimes.

The film follows Beth as she does her best to hold the family together even while the various problems tear them apart. At the center is Jake's drinking and further carelessness of his family's dissipation. While Beth's answer is to nurture and aid her children, Jake insists it's best to drink away the problems and quit being so ""soft"" on the kids. And we watch, through it all, as the family spirals further apart. Near the end, after seeing both happy and horrible things happen to each of the characters, we are jarred by several traumatic events. Beth and Jake both deal with it uniquely, as she draws once again on the tremendous power of family and human spirit, while Jake shows some emotions we may not expect. The last 15 minutes of the film keep us in suspense as we wonder whether a certain horrible injustice will be confronted, and if so, how.

The last few moments of the movie made me want to jump to my feet and applaud. Though not all agreeable, everyone's actions are understandable. Especially those of Beth and her oldest son, whose interaction with Jake results in my favorite scene in the movie. But don't think you know what's going to happen based on this description, because believe me, you don't. I felt satisfied with the conclusion on all fronts, and thought that each character showed exactly where their strength lies.

Be forewarned that this movie is very heartbreaking. Its overall tone is one of futility, of better lives not received, of wanting the best but never quite getting it. It is very raw and intense in its portrayal of physical and domestic violence, and the easily upset may have a hard time waiting to see if it ends happily enough for their tastes. But no matter what your opinion is, it will definitely be a film that stays with you for a long, long time. My highest recommendation.

SEQUEL NOTE: If you liked this movie, see if you can ever find the rare ""What Becomes of the Broken Hearted"", a direct follow-up to the events in this film with the same cast. While not as good, it tells a different sort of story from a different kind of perspective and is very much worth watching for a good sense of closure to some of these characters.",1112054400,6,3362,4.532125205930807
1341859,4,B00004RCKI,"An infuriating tale of a Maori family living in poverty, as the violent drunk head of household cannot hold down a job and batters his wife while terrorizing the family. Unfortunately I imagine viewers are supposed to understand the cycle of poverty and the hopes the mother, Beth, has for her family (trapped in the cycle of abuse as she is), but it is difficult not be become completely angry with her ineptitude, obliviousness, and too strong and nave a belief in the idea that everything will turn out fine or change of its own accord. She and her husband both drink too much and don't provide much in the way of being role models for the children (the oldest son is a gang member, the other son has been arrested, and the young, beautiful, sensitive and intelligent daughter who tries to escape this cycle ends up paying the ultimate price as she sees no escape and actually loses the most in this heartbreaking film). The family is torn apart not just but the obvious-drinking, anger, physical abuse (effects of poverty) but by sexual abuse, negligence (refusal to see the truths in front of your face), denial and enabling. Although she is terrorized and abused, Beth bears some of the responsibility in her desperate situation; as a mother, she should have protected her children but kept making excuses and enabling her husband to abuse her and the children (which she continues until tragedy strikes). She is a strong woman but cannot resist her husband and keeps letting him erode and destroy her life and the lives of the children, and it is only when confronted by the horrors and realities of what her negligence has driven her children to that she grasps the gravity of seizing control of her life.",1110585600,2,1713,4.713333333333333
1341860,5,B00004RCKI,"Anyone who has been affected by the cancer of domestic abuse can relate, and find strength in this tragically beautiful film.  Once Were Warriors will come too close to home for many.

The stories center is Beth Heke(Rena Owen) a Moari matriarch, who is struggling to tend to her volatile family.  Rena Owen, and especially Temuera Morrison were criminally overlooked in international acclaim for their career defining performances.  Temuera Morrison's performance to this day strikes me to the core of my being as a character that I have known, fear, pity, and can relate to on many different levels.  The family's situation is volatile for the following reasons.

1.  The extreme levels of poverty and unemployment, and the social ills that accompany them.  The plight of the Moari people was compared once to the plight of Native Americans living on land reservations here in America, by a friend and resident of New Zealand.

2.  Her children Grace(Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell), Nig(Julian arahanga), Boogie(Taungaroa Emile), and two youngest are all succumbing to their environment in dramatically different avenues.  Grace is the artistically inclined sensitive protector of her under 5 year old brother and sister.  Grace shields the little ones from the horror of life, at the cost of her own passions and talents.  Nig is approaching adulthood, and is heavily involved with urban street gangs.  Boogie is the teenager who is regularly in trouble with the police, and is looking at institutionalization.

3.  Jake Heke(Temuera Morrison) a.k.a Jake the Muss a.k.a. Beths husband and the childrens father.  Jake and his ""friends"" are the end product of the social machine that the children are dangerously close to entering.  Jake is regularly unemployed, constantly drinking with his friends, and always ready to answer any situation with rage and or fists.  Jakes regular target is Beth.

What this film is truly about(without spoiling the film) is rediscovering the pride that exists within a people.  Once Were Warriors transends all ethnic barriers in this respect( but does an outstanding job of shedding light on the little known Moari people).  Pride and history is present in all peoples.  To find solutions to the present, you have to examine the past.  Do not search for villains in this film.  Even in the monsterous Jake, one can still see the young boy that lost faith in his people, his family, and himself a long time ago.  A brutal, honest, soul ravaging film, this should be required viewing for any family",1102204800,3,2524,5.095121951219512
