528797,4,6302990114,"This 1978 film of Agatha Christe's ""Death on the Nile"" is a personal favorite of mine.  As a film, it is not what I would refer to as being great or definitive, but it is very good, and it is a lot of great  fun to watch.  This is the type of film with which to curl up on a  comfortable chair, with popcorn in hand, and to completely enjoy --- and  there is a lot to enjoy here.  The basic formula is not unlike other film  adaptions of Agatha Christe's books:  surround Hercule Poirot with an  outstanding supporting cast of actors, place them in an exotic and  picturesque locale, and let nature take it's course.  There are some  stunning location shots of Egypt here, and some very funny sequences as  well (the tango sequence at the hotel immediately prior to the departure of  the cruise boat down the Nile River), all of which add to the overall charm  of this movie.  When the film begins with the effective opening music, one  cannot but be impressed with the cast assembled for this movie, and what an  outstanding cast it is!  Peter Ustinov is an endearingly foxy Hercule  Poirot, and the ensemble performances of Mia Farrow, David Niven, Bette  Davis, Maggie Smith, Jon Finch, Angela Lansbury, and George Kennedy are all  first-rate.  The film is wonderfully reminiscent of the types of movies  Hollywood used to be so good at putting together.  There are  improbabilities in the script to be sure, but none of this matters at all.  It's an awful lot of fun, and isn't that what it's all about?",944265600,3,1507,4.5055762081784385

529041,5,6302990114,"Review of Death on the Nile
Hot Toasty Rag, September 17, 2017

Everyone can agree that David Suchet is the best Hercule Poirot. Ever. Yes, Albert Finny was very good in Murder on the Orient Express, but Agatha Christies creation is truly captured in David Suchets 14-year series that adapted every one of Poirots detective adventures.

That being said, I absolutely love the 1978 version of Death on the Nile. Peter Ustinov plays the famous Belgian detective, and although he isn't my favorite, the supporting cast more than makes up for it. David Niven, Mia Farrow, Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, George Kennedy, Olivia Hussey, Lois Chiles, Jack Warden, Angela Lansbury, Jon Finch, and Jane Birkin add to this fantastically lush, unforgettable murder mystery.

Ustinov is on vacation, taking a cruise on the Nile River. He meets and observes the previously listed supporting cast, and theres an obvious tension in the air. I won't tell you any more about the plot, but since it is an Agatha Christie mystery, you should expect a murder. The acting, on-location filming, and perfectly paced script makes this film a real classic. David Niven plays the Hastings-type sidekick, and hes perfectly handsome, debonair, and brave. The scene where he battles a rattlesnake is one of my favorites! I also love Mia Farrow, and she gives a wonderful performance opposite Lois Chiles, her costar from The Great Gatsby.

Death on the Nile is one of my all-time favorite whodunnit movies. If you haven't seen this classic yet, and you like mysteries or detective stories, pick up a copy this weekend. Youll love it!

529088,4,6302990114,"Poirot has been played by several actors, the most prominent being David Souchet in the long-running TV series, and of course by Albert Finney in Murder on the Orient Express. Only Souchet has the actual size and style of the diminutive Belgian sleuth, but in the case, Peter Ustinov does quite well and no complaint whatsoever. David Niven is his side-kick here (he always has one) and a good thing it is because he comes just in time to slice a slithering cobra with his sword. Since I had seen the Souchet Nile, the mystery took second place to the style. One would not expect less from producers Richard Godwin and John Brabourne, who also produced Evil Under the Sun and Murder. Lois Chiles was superb--though she dies too soon (sorry)--and Mia Farrow (the two were together in the Great Gatsby) a fading actress, not belonging to the string of great actresses alongside her--Bette Davis and Angela Lansbury especially. Good fun though, if you are prone to like Dame Agatha's convoluted tales.",1492473600,,998,4.808139534883721

Who made it? Who cares? First take, awful everything, casting, sets, acting, directing. Bleh. Thank God it didn't cost an arm and a foot. Can't believe it got such high marks.

I like Peter Ustinov as an actor and enjoy most of his work. This production is not 'superior', but it's still delightful in every sense of the word. I think the film has held up well over time. If you're expecting the same film and production quality as say 'Murder on the Orient Express' with Albert Finney (he was totally robbed of best actor for The Dresser), then you'll be disappointed with this one. The quality is good, but not great. If you think of it as an exceptionally good t.v. movie, then that will give you an idea of what to expect.",1483747200,3,711,4.476923076923077

The excursion to the pyramids was suspenseful, and the denouement kept my interest.  I purchased this movie on the strength of a similar feature, Evil Under The Sun.  For fans of that film, this one did not disappoint, although the tone was not as high-key.  Very entertaining.  I didn't quite understand the motivation of the Bette Davis character.

The plot was unbelievable, especially the ending. SPOILER ALERT!!! Yeah, right...the guy shoots himself in the leg, is bleeding buckets.... and is still able to function after that.

Mia Farrow in particular was just so annoying in this movie, whining all the time.

Peter Ustinov did not make for a good Pierot, as another reviewer said here, reminded me of Santa, not a famous detective.

And Angela Lansbury, whom I usually love in films, was not good in this one either. Seemed phony and too over the top, even for the saucy novelist she was supposedly portraying.

The movie is a follow up to the success of ""Murder on the Orient Express"" but stars Peter Ustinov as Poirot and he would later do ""Evil Under the Sun"", like those this film has a ""big name"" cast that do a nice job.  The story follows the original Christie book very well and is more enjoyable than ""Orient Express"" which, in my opinion, was marred by the conclusion, even though it is the same as the novel.

529497,4,6302990114,"Peter Ustinov's first outing as Hercule Poirot in the second of the Brabourne/Goodwin series of Christie adaptations turns out to be highly entertaining.  While there are some awkward moments and risible dialog - especially at the end - John Guillermin's film is redeemed by some memorable individual sequences.  The interplay between Poirot and Colonel Race (David Niven) is keenly illuminated - at one point Race raises his eyebrows in exasperation as he hears the Belgian detective self-importantly describing himself as ""the great Hercule Poirot.""  The Colonel has a rather bad time of it; earlier on in the film he is forced to dance a grotesque tango with Mrs. Salome Otterbourne (Angela Lansbury), where he desperately tries and fails to keep up with her.  Poirot tries his best to be polite in the company of others, but his patience is stretched to the limit by Mrs. Otterbourne's relentless obsession with sex and sexuality.  At the end of one evening he is saddled with the onerous responsibility of taking her back to her cabin, while desperately trying to stop her collapsing to the floor in a drunken stupor.  Bette Davis and Maggie Smith have a fine time trading insults as an elderly American dilettante and her full-time ""companion""; Davis has one especially rich line as she suggests that she should take Smith for a ""cooling break"" in the Gobi Desert.  Jack Cardiff's memorable cinematography shows the breathtaking beauty of the Egyptian landscapes, but suggests at the same time that they can be sinister - especially in the sequence taking place at the Karnak Temple, in which Linnet Ridgeway (Lois Chiles) is quite literally placed in mortal danger.  Nini Rota's memorable theme-tune gives the film a stately feel as the boat plows its inexorable progress down the Nile.  Even after thirty-five years, DEATH ON THE NILE is still highly watchable as much for the quality of the performances as for Christie's convoluted tale.",1408665600,2,1947,5.059375

In the novel Miss Marie Van Schuyler travels with her cousin Cornelia Robson and Miss Bowers.  In the 1978 film only Miss Bowers (Maggie Smith) appears.  In the 2004 film only Cornelia Robson (Daisy Donovan) appears and  as in the book  she ends up being engaged to Dr Ludwig Bessner (Steve Pemberton).

Joanna Southwood, Mrs Allerton and Tim Allerton (who, in the book, steals Linnet Ridgeways pearls) appear in the 2004 film but not in the 1978 film  where Marie Van Schuyler (Bette Davis) is the thief.

The 1978 film never reveals that James Ferguson (John Finch)  who becomes attached to Rosalie Otterbourne (Olivia Hussey)  is actually Lord Dawlish.  In the book and the 2004 film Rosalie Otterbourne is attracted to Tim Allerton.

In the novel the literary Karnak travels from the first cataract (south of Aswan) to Es-Seba to Abu Simbel to Wdi Halfa and return.  In the 1978 Peter Ustinov cinema film the Karnak goes on a scenic but fanciful journey from the Cataract Hotel at Aswan to Kom Ombo/Karnak and then Abu Simbel and a stand-in for Wdi Halfa.  In the 2004 David Suchet TV film the Karnak goes north from the Winter Palace at Luxor via the Temple of Luxor to the Temple of Dendera and return.

Agatha Christies original of the literary Karnak was probably Cook & Sons stern-wheeler Thebes which steamed between Aswan and Wadi Halfa.

529648,5,6302990114,"Based upon Agatha Christie's mystery novel, 1978's ""Death on the Nile"" is a lavish, all-star 1930's period piece featuring Peter Ustinov in his first turn as her famed Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. Ustinov brings his own distinctive charm to the role, as he is supported by a most impressive array of co-stars (Bette Davis, Angela Lansbury, Mia Farrow, David Niven, Maggie Smith, etc).  Very leisurely paced but never to the point of utterly boring, this film is exceptionally faithful to its source material re: a baffling homicide of a newlywed heiress (Lois Chiles) aboard a posh Egyptian cruise ship.  Poirot and colleague Col. Race (David Niven) have a whole slew of possible suspects with the means, motive, and opportunity, including the vengeful ex-lover (Mia Farrow) of the victim's dashing husband (Simon MacCorkindale).  As with many Christie mysteries, one has to swallow the disbelief that so many of the victim's possible enemies could conveniently all be on the same ship at the same time.  With that said, it is still generally a real treat viewing an old-school Hollywood production celebrating one of Agatha Christie's finest novels.

The story begins in 1930s rural England where a Rolls-Royce drives to a country mansion. Miss Ridgeway inspects the grounds. They talk about a fortune hunter. Her friend Jackie asks Miss Ridgeway to give her boyfriend Simon Doyle a job; she agrees. Next, Linette will marry Simon and go on a honeymoon to Egypt. Uncle Andrew Pennington also plans to travel. The newlyweds climb a pyramid. Jackie is there too. Linette complains about her. We see other wealth tourists enjoy their vacation (and their background). Hercule Poirot is on vacation. Some dance the tango. [Isnt it obsolete today, like the quadrille?] Poirot offers advice to Jackie about her life. Do not allow evil into your heart. The visitors board their cruise ship (a side wheeler). The talk tells about these people. [Would you want them as co-workers or neighbors?] Linette won't sign legal documents unless she reads them. [Good advice.] Linettes maid asks for promised money but is refused. Her lawyer is under suspicion.

They ride donkeys and visit the sites. [Do some act suspiciously?] A falling stone nearly kills Linette! The others gather around. [For an alibi?] Poirot warns Jackie again. [What does he know?] Linette argues with a physician from Zurich over his treatment. Jackie acts unpleasant. When Simon tells her off Jackie draws her derringer and shoots him in his right leg! Later a scream at night tells of the murder of Linette! There is a J on the wall, written in blood. But Jackie has an alibi. Who are the suspects? Poirot and the Colonel begin the investigation. We see his hypothetical explanations. Who had a motive? [Too many?] The other passengers are questioned. Where are Mrs. Doyles pearls? Where is the gun? Who put a snake in Poirots room? A sword cane solves this problem. The natives fished out the murder weapon - a four shot .22 derringer. Where are Linettes pearls?

Penningtons cabin is searched. Was he trying to keep control of Linettes fortune? Is Jackie still in love with Simon? She talks to him. The Colonel and Poirot discuss the suspects: all of them. Blood reveal another body! Was the maid Louise Bourget a witness to be eliminated? Mrs. Otterbine has a solution: she is an eyewitness. But a shot silences her! Poirot gathers the tourists together in one room to solve the murders. Was there a third shot? Was Louises language a clue? Poirot reconstructs the murders. [Was it a surprise to you? Was it too complicated to succeed? Did it require split-second timing?] Wheres the proof? The moulage test uses paraffin to detect whose hand fired a pistol. There is an admission, then a tragic end. The tourists leave the boat.

I haven't read the novel so I don't know how true it is to the book. It is a good dramatic story. It follows the old style where the murder victim is shown to be a nasty person (so the viewer doesnt feel bad about the murder), and, all the suspects are gathered together in one room when the crime is solved. Wasnt this story implausible? Did this story remind you of Murder on the Orient Express? Notice the slimness of some of the actors (historical accuracy?). Did women then wear such revealing dresses? How did Linette fall so quickly in love with Simon? Was it easy to buy poisonous snakes? Were people free to carry arms then? Raymond Chandlers essay The Simple Art of Murder criticized those murder mysteries which were concocted to make a puzzle for the reader to solve.",1395100800,,3452,4.7675585284280935

Agatha Christie's ""Death on the Nile"" staring Peter Ustinov as Poirot was sensational and one of Christie's most famous mysteries. The story was set in 1937 and is superb. The 1978 movie, directed by John Guillermin is a stunner and the ending is un-creditable.
The cast is loaded with stars including Colonel Race (David Niven), who was a wonderful batman for Poirot (Peter Ustinov) and danced a stylish tango with Mrs. Otterbourne (Angela Lansbury) at the Cataract Hotel in Assuan. The trip up the Nile, aboard the water wheel boat Karnak, was beautiful. The stop at the Temple of Ammon in Karnak was wonderful. The attempted murder in the Hypostyle Hall in the Temple of Ammon of Linnet Doyle (Lois Chiles) and her new husband Simon Doyle (Simon Mac Corkindale)  possibly by Andrew Pennington (George Kennedy) Linnet's American Trustee dislodging a heavy stone far above the floor  was a gut wrenching close call. The next day, at the temple of Abu-Simbel, Jacqueline de Bellefort, (Mia Farrow), the abandoned fianc, again taunted Linnet.
Poirot attempted to convince Jacie to back off and leave the newlyweds alone. But Jacie answered ""If love can't live in your heart, evil will do just as well."" The sparring continued until Jacie shot Simon in the leg, and Linnet was found dead having been shot in the temple. From there things got even worse, both Louise (Jane Berkin) and Mrs. Otterbourne were killed. The clues keep appearing and continued to get tangled. It became difficult to track who was where and who had an alibi for what. Finally Poirot put his little grey sells to work, and announced that there would be a gathering of everyone in the salon where he would reveal everything. What did happen was in creditable and surprised everyone.

This is one of Agatha Christie's finest works, and one of Peter Ustinov's best performances as Poirot. It you have a copy of this mystery staring David Suchet as Poirot you can make a close comparison of the two. I prefer this version with Ustinov playing Poirot but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.

It you have a copy of this mystery staring David Suchet as Poirot you can make a direct comparison of the two. The later interpretations of Poirot by David Suchet have gotten a little overly critical and intense for my taste. His earlier performances when he had Col. Hastings and Miss Lemon were much better. I prefer this version with Ustinov playing Poirot but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.. This DVD is a must have for everyone with any interest in British mysteries or in Agatha Christie's work.",1390003200,3,2437,4.865060240963856

529805,3,6302990114,"Though this film conveys its story adequately, my view of it is greatly influenced by two things.  One is my having seen all the Poirot episodes starring David Suchet, and two is my having seen Mr. Ustinov and Maggie Smith in ""Hot MIllions"" about a week before watching ""Death on the Nile.""  By comparison to Mr. Suchet's Poirot and to his own subtle performance in ""Hot Millions,"" Peter Ustinov's Poirot evokes a rugby player posing as a ballet dancer.  Even his scraggly mustache comes in a distant second to Mr. Suchet's precisely delineated adornment.  And poor Ms Smith is so restrained as to disappear almost completely into the wallpaper, where she is joined by some other competent performers.

The quality of the performances may be attributable to the fact, if true, that the director and cast were not allowed to view dailies during the shooting or to the unpleasant conditions prevailing on location, which I assume featured hot and muggy weather not pleasant for actors togged out London style.  So I wonder how much shooting was done on the replica boat constructed on the London sound stage.  The behind-the-scenes feature on the DVD stresses the replica's fidelity and shows the construction of it, so I assume it was used extensively.  The question not addressed was how practical is such a replica when shooting interiors that call for wild walls all around and plenty of overhead space for lights.

Lois Chiles plays Linnet Ridgeway, a spoiled heiress who is talked by her best friend Jackie (Mia Farrow) - a perky, vibrant woman who is at the opposite of the wealth spectrum from Linnet - into giving a job to Jackie's handsome husband-to-be, Simon Doyle (Simon MacCorkindale).  Within a short period of time, however, it's Linnet and Simon who end up in love and married ... and a spiteful, vengeful Jackie who follows the couple on their whirlwind honeymoon, stalking and ridiculing them at every turn.

Enter the famous detective Hercule Poirot (Ustinov), on vacation and taking a cruise up the Nile when he runs into the Doyles - both of whom beg him to talk to Jackie before something truly bad happens.  But Jackie is not to be dissuaded, and soon murder occurs ... and the one person who seems to have a cast-iron alibi is Jackie.

A VERY cool whodunnit, often played tongue-in-cheek and worth seeing for the cast alone (though the film also offers some beautiful location shots).  Bette Davis and Maggie Smith, playing (respectively) a rich curmudgeon and her manly nurse, are a special delight when on-screen, either alone or together, and the ending is purely typical of an Agatha Christie puzzle that will surprise those not in the know.

529909,5,6302990114,"DEATH ON THE NILE was written by Agatha Christie and first published in 1937, and this movie starring Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot was released in 1978. In this review I will speak about both because many fans will enjoy reading the book and watching the movie, as I did.

The main story centers around twenty year old Linnet Ridgeway, a wealthy heiress who somehow manages to make enemies of several people including her best friend Jackie when she steals and marries Simon Doyle, her fiancee. Linnet and Simon spend their honeymoon in Egypt, where most of this story takes place. She is murdered one night in her cabin aboard a Nile cruise ship, and Poirot and his friend Colonel Race conduct the investigation. There are several suspects on board the ship who either had a grudge against the victim or would benefit financially by her death. Christie has written a great story, with a complex plot, several twists and turns, and a seemingly impossible solution. The book is hard to put down.

Anyone interested in getting the Kindle book should know that it is nicely formatted and reads well.

As is typical, the book has several characters and intricate story details and some of these are omitted from the film. There are also some variations in the movie story vs. the book, and to me the biggest difference from the book is that Poirot overtly accuses each suspect of having a motive and the opportunity to commit the crime, and there are accompanying scenes of each suspect retrieving the pistol and killing Linnet Doyle as Poirot describes what they could have done. I suppose this was necessary for the film because much of the book contains quiet, low key Poirot discussing clues and possibilities with Colonel Race, and this would not have been as interesting for movie viewers. For dramatic purposes, the movie also creates enmity between Linnet and Dr. Bessner and Linnet suing author Salome Otterbourne for libel.

The movie creates a nice period setting with award winning costume design, and was filmed on site in Egypt. The photography of sites like the pyramids and ancient temples is stunning. All players acted well, except I think Angela Lansbury over-played the role of alcoholic erotic author Salome Otterbourne because she was always drunk and rarely stood up straight. This exaggeration was done for movie audiences, I suppose.

529911,5,6302990114,I believe this is one of the best of the Poirot movies. It has a great location and plot and keeps you guessing until the end. Peter Ustinov does an outstanding job as Poirot. (...and why not? His dad was actually a spy!) I can heartily recommend this movie to any Poirot enthusiast.,1352678400,2,283,4.3584905660377355
529912,4,6302990114,"The cast is superb, especially Bette Davis and Angela Lansbury who have the luxury of playing some very colorful characters.  Everyone right down to the great Maggie Smith in a supporting role give outstanding performances.

I've read lots of Christie but not seen any of the films before this.  So, I can take Ustinov's Poirot performance with nothing to compare it to.  I must say, he was terrific.

The only issue I have with this film, as with the book is that it takes too long for the murder to happen.  Yes, there are many characters and it takes time to do the proper setups and establishing of motives.  Even so, I could have done with a few less characters so the more interesting ones like Davis and Lansbury could have more screen time.  That way, the murder could have happened sooner.  This film and book depart from Christie's usual format.  Quickly establish characters.  Murder happens.  The rest of the book is the unraveling of the plot and investigation.  It's over an hour into the film before the murder happens.  That's too long.

Once it does happen, it's classic Christie.  The pace picks up as the bodies pile up.  I've only ever guessed a Christie murder twice and this was one of the times...but it wasn't until near the end.  As usual, she has you changing suspects and second guessing yourself all the time.  Even though I knew WHO, and WHY, I didn't know HOW it was done.  Christie's attention to detail in the premeditation aspects is always highly detailed.  There were a few nitpicky things about some of these details, but I'm letting them go because the rest was so good.  Even after the murderer is revealed, there are STILL unexpected turns that I didn't see coming.  I can definitely see why Nile is in the upper echelon of Christie's body of work.",1345852800,,1787,4.6210191082802545
529913,5,6302990114,"I had to get this video because I missed the first fifteen minutes during the 1978  screening.

The screenplay effectively throws out some characters and sub plots from the book. Cornelia Robson and Rosalie Otterbourne become one character while a sub plot involving one of the ship's staff by the name of Richetti was excised.

Death On The Nile is one of Agatha Chrisrie's best novels. Set in 1937, the rich but not beloved heiress Linnet Ridgeway is murdered during her honeymoon on board the Nile steamer Karnak. In true Christie style, everyone save for her husband and once best friend turned love rival have a reason to kill her.

The puzzle starts to deepen as bodies start to pile up. In addition, Poirot has to contend with a kleptomaniac, a misbehaved drunk and a crooked lawyer. I'm glad they did not edit these out.

Peter Ustinov as Poirot differs vastly from Christie's literary description. But Ustinov flat out owns Poirot. His habit of gathering everyone to reveal the murderers' identities is in line with the fictional creation's vanity. Ustinov's Poirot also loves to eat. While he tucked into a lovely sundae in Evil Under The Sun, he has moray eel for dinner in this movie.

Watching Death On The Nile is like taking a holiday. Expect plenty of breathtaking scenery as the characters travel in fabulous 1930s fashion to various locales - the Sphinx, the Egyptian pyramids and other ancient and exotic places.

The veterans give the performances of their lives. Bette Davis is the covetous rich dame Van Schuyler with Maggie Smith as her acid tongued companion Miss Bowers. Angela Lansbury is a hoot as the sex author Salome Otterbourne and David Niven is great as Poirot's right hand man.

Mia Farrow is a great choice as Jackie de Bellefort, the jilted wronged vengeful woman. Jane Birkin (yes she of the Birkin bag) is utterly convincing as the bullied maid while her self centred boss is played by Bond girl Lois Chiles (watch Moonraker). Generally the rest of the cast put up very strong performances. The young talents in this film must be legends now.

Part murder mystery and part tragic romance, Death On The Nile brings to life Christie's most baffling case and takes you on an unforgettable cinematic outing. I'm glad to have kept the 70s novel with the movie poster on the cover.",1341187200,2,2313,4.791457286432161

529930,4,6302990114,"John Guillermin's ""Death on the Nile"" (1978) makes for a pleasant two and a half hours, as long as you're willing to participate in the conventions of the Hercule Poirot murder mystery as set forth by Agatha Christie.  Guillermin, who had previously worked with an all-star cast in ""The Towering Inferno"" (1974), effectively directs a comparable cast of luminaries here, led by Peter Ustinov as Poirot and also featuring, among others, Bette Davis, Mia Farrow, Olivia Hussey, George Kennedy, Angela Lansbury, David Niven, Maggie Smith, and Jack Warden.  The conventions that one must accept, if one is to enjoy this sort of film, include the following: 1) A murder will be committed in an enclosed space (here, a Nile River cruise boat); 2) the murderer will commit his or her crime in spite of being aware of the presence of a world-renowned detective who has never failed to solve a case; 3) virtually everyone on the boat, with the exception of said detective, will have a plausible motive for having committed the murder; and 4) all of the suspects will sit together, quietly and cooperatively, in a comfortable parlor at story's end while said detective identifies the murderer and explains how he solved the crime.  In the case of ""Death on the Nile,"" the victim is wealthy heiress Linnet Ridgeway (played by Lois Chiles), and the motives of the various passengers on the boat range from broken love to financial self-interest.  Ustinov makes a fine Poirot, though I prefer Albert Finney's portrayal of the same character in Sidney Lumet's ""Murder on the Orient Express"" (1973); the rest of the cast provides solid support.  Future TV sleuth Angela Lansbury seems to be having particular fun as one of the suspects, a sex-crazed romance novelist.  The film also features gorgeous photography of ancient Egyptian sites such as the temple complex of Abu Simbel, along with Academy Award-winning costume design.  And I was impressed with how fair-mindedly Guillermin as director scattered clues throughout the film, in a manner that is faithful to the spirit of Christie's work.  If you like watching film adaptations of Agatha Christie's novels, this film should not disappoint you.",1294704000,,2186,5.052777777777778

Still, it doesn't take long to get the feeling that the number of closeups and lines of dialogue were all dictated more by star contracts than by the director's discretion.

The whole movie is packed with great actors, yet even thought you recognize them they do not distract from the characters that they play.

I thought that it was a nice touch when the kids along the shore mooned Mrs. Van Schuyler (Bette Davis) as kids would do everywhere.

Simon (Simon MacCorkindale) and his new bride Linnet (Lois Chiles) are being perused by Jacqueline De Bellefort (Mia Farrow) the girl he jilted.  Once onboard a boat going down the Nile bodies are dropping like flies.  Everyone is a suspect.  Everybody could have done it as we see the proof acted out.  And yet nobody could have done it as all alibis hold up.  Only Hercule Poirot can logically figure this out.  Naturally as usual Hercule Poirot is in the right place at the right time to hear everything and extract the truth.

I thought it was odd that a film with such a star-studded cast only received two stars. How could so many big names (nearly the entire cast) commit to a project so average? Peter Ustinov plays the great detective but occasionally slips out of his fake foreign accent. The director let it go. He does okay, overall, but it's nothing special or memorable. The movie moves along but most of it is so ho-hum. I don't recall any music used to influence mood and increase tension. The whodunnit murder mystery genre is so overdone, and this one has the tired cliche of 'anyone could have done it because everyone had a motive.' It's disappointing that it's such a low-budget movie. (Did they spend the entire budget on salaries?) They get off the boat only once, to see some ancient ruins, and the rest of the time they're all couped up on the boat. The set is dull. We don't even get to see any scenery despite the whole movie being filmed on location. The cinematography rating is zero stars. The closeups of dead people are gratuitous and unnecessary; they ruin it for young children. The ending of this old flick is nasty and you can't really walk away from it feeling satisfied like you do with many films. You realize at the end that in many respects Death on the Nile is better suited as a play instead of a movie. I thought the director tried too hard to make this such a clever plot you'd never suspect who committed the murders. Nearly half the cast getting bumped off virtually makes it a parody of the genre.",1235865600,6,1611,4.464406779661017

529966,4,6302990114,"Wow! What better backdrop for a story than the pyramids and ancient ruins of Egypt.  Set mainly along the Nile, I sometimes found the story second to the scenery! Not that the story didn't fully engage - it did! The varied characters in Death on the Nile, are quite a bunch - there is an element of humor underneath all the intrigue. We know someone is going to get it as the movie unwinds, but who? and by whom? Many seem to have their reasons...

I loved the first half of this movie.  It starts off with the craziest scenario.  Niece wants fiance to get a managerial position at her very rich auntie's estate.  She asks auntie and auntie says, well, let's meet him.  Did I mention that besides being filthy rich, auntie is also quite young and attractive?  When auntie meets fiance, sparks suddenly fly and then -

Cut to Egypt.  Suddenly riding horses amongst the pyramids - rich auntie, and niece's fiance - they're married!  And trailing around in their dust is the poor niece, bent on making a nuissance of herself during the honeymoon that should have been hers!  There's a certain humour.  And the scenery of the Nile, the ancient ruins, the Sphynx - it's stunning, and yet very much a part of the story.

For the second half of the movie though, I started to find myself less engaged.  It became more of what I think of when I think of a cliche mystery.  Less shots of Egypt.  Less humorous situations.  More tedious regurgitation of the murder as the Ustinov tries to solve the case.

The second half I give 3 stars as a noticeable lull seems to set in with the latter part of the cruise.  It becomes more ""in the head"", and I wasn't terribly convinced when the murder was finally solved.  A bit far-fetched..  While I don't mind far-fetched if it entertains simultaneously, I was becoming less and less entertained as the movie wound it's way toward the conclusion.  Not terrible.  Just not what the first half of the movie was - gorgeous, clever, witty and interesting.  One reason for this may have been that for the second half of the movie less attention is paid to the myriad of interesting characters interacting with each other, and all things focus on Ustinov, who's rather stuffy and dry most of the time, although he's not awful.  Just not as interesting as other characters which get more attention in the better half of this movie - the first.  Fortunately, the story ends on a powerful note.

This movie is worth seeing.  There are some jaw-droppingly beautiful scenes, which, at the same time, tie in so perfectly with the story.  The tying together of such a dramatic backdrop (Egypt) with the riviting story this begins as, and the satisfactory final scenes, make this movie more than well-worth seeing.",1207526400,,2731,4.596273291925466

The inimitable Sir Peter Ustinov is Hercule Poirot, and his relaxing(!) Nile cruise is rudely interrupted by murder and mystery. His fellow passengers are the usual A-list assembly of stars, and there's an unusually high mortality rate among them--several murders and a few maimings. Everyone aboard wants to kill the beautiful heiress (Lois Chiles), and someone succeeds. Is it the crooked lawyer (George Kennedy)? The crooked doctor (Jack Warden)? The slanderous romance novelist (Angela Lansbury) and her nervous daughter (Olivia Hussey)? The larcenous lady (Bette Davis) and her grim companion (Maggie Smith)? The unhinged romantic rival (Mia Farrow)? Or is it her handsome, mysterious husband (Simon MacCorkindale)? Poirot gets to the bottom of it, natch, accompanied by eye-popping views of the great river and its tourist attractions, sensible direction by John Guillermin (THE TOWERING INFERNO), and a moody, graceful musical score by the great Nino Rota (THE GODFATHER, Franco Zeffirelli's ROMEO AND JULIET).

Here the only thing that matches the majesty of the great Nino Rota score (which brilliantly evokes a Nile steamboat, the location for much of this film's action is Mia Farrow's performance as Jackie. This was probably the best role Farrow got in the Seventies, and while it allows her to do her specialty in evoking hysteria it also allows her the rare opportunity to play a really intelligent character. Her scenes menacing her ex-lover and best friend (who have married one another behind her back) by turning up at Egyptian tourist sites and reciting statistics about the sites to them are memorably strange. Peter Ustinov makes a fine Poirot, and Angela Lansbury is a lot of fun as a Marie Corelli-like hack novelist, and Simon MacCorkindale is suitably dreamy as Farrow's ex-lover, but no one else is up to the scale the production seems to demand. Several actors seem terribly underused (particular Olivia Hussey and Maggie Smith), and Bette Davis as a Washington grande dame looks like a walking mummy (which should be suitable to the theme but instead is rather creepy). Very few of the characters have plausible motives for murder, so the time spent discussing whether or not they committed the central crime seems pretty tedious.",1201392000,2,1487,4.9282868525896415

529991,4,6302990114,"For some reason, I always thought that ""Death on the Nile"" was a marginal Agatha Christie adaptation, one that certainly paled in comparison to the great ""Murder on the Orient Express"", which was produced some five years earlier.  So I never bothered to see it.  Well, I finally caught up with the movie on DVD, and, boy, was I wrong.  ""Death on the Nile"" is a really good movie.

You get so much here: exotic scenery; a great set where most of the story takes place (an early 20th century steamer); about a dozen famous actors giving top-notch performances (some understated, some slightly scenery-chewing, but all entertaining); solid direction by John Guillerman; a polished screenplay by Anthony Shaffer (Hitchcock's ""Frenzy""); and, to top it all off, a wonderful, memorable score by Nino Rota (""The Godfather"").

And the film features the best kind of Agatha Christie murder plot and solution: one that is sufficiently complex, but understandable and believable (at least in the world of the movie) once the great Hercule Poirot explains it all to us.  It also helps that the solution is genuinely clever.

Is ""Death on the Nile"" as great as ""Murder on the Orient Express""?  In the end, probably not.  But the worst one can really say is that ""Murder"" is a lush, epic, beautiful film that just happens to be a murder mystery, while ""Death"" is clearly part of the murder mystery genre from the outset.  But there's nothing wrong with a really great murder mystery, and this film is one of them.

The DVD features an excellent widescreen print that's sharp and bright, and a handful of interesting extras, including a 24-minute behind-the-scenes featurette produced at the time of the film's release (probably for the emerging cable market) and a couple of interviews conducted by a Spanish journalist, where we get to see Peter Ustinov answer questions quite well with his servicable Spanish (conveniently subtitled in English).

By the way, I finally saw this movie not because I'm an Agatha Christie fan (though I am such a fan, as many of my Amazon reviews readily demonstrate), but because I'm doing a favor for my wife and watching with her all the movies available on DVD that feature the great Bette Davis, in their original release order.  It's been fun.  However, by the time the late 1970's rolled around, there weren't any true ""Bette Davis movies"" anymore, only movies that offered small or moderate character roles for the once top box office draw.  So, in addition to everything else that's good about the film, one gets to see Bette Davis in one of her last five or six roles here.  It's not a huge, memorable role (apparently Ms. Davis was disappointed that this movie wasn't able to do for her what ""Murder on the Orient Express"" did for Ingrid Bergmann, namely earn her another late-career Academy Award), but seeing her is one more pleasure in a film rich with pleasures great and small.",1197936000,2,2910,4.824949698189135

My concerns were quickly laid to rest, when at a hotel on the banks of the Nile, Mr. Poirot spoke in his French-accented Belgian voice to David Niven who played a lawyer representing Lynette Doyle's (aka Ridgeway's) interests, one knew this would be a film worth viewing. All the key players in this murder/drama were staying at the same hotel, waiting for the luxury steamboat ""Karnak"" to arrive and take them on their cruise down the Nile ...

Based on Agatha Christie's book of the same title, the film is superbly cast with such great names as Bette Davis, Angela Lansbury, Mia Farrow, Olivia Hussey, George Kennedy, Jack Warden, and actors and actresses unknown to me: Lois Chiles (played the leading lady, Lynette Ridgeway), Jane Birkin, Maggie Smith, and Jon Finch. The story begins as the heiress and socialite, Lynette Ridgeway arrives home at her great estate in England. She is greeted by the servants and her best friend or relative, Jacqueline (played by Mia Farrow) who begs her to hire her fiance and lover, who is penniless and without a job. When they are introduced, a spark is exchanged, and one senses that Ms Ridgeway will win him in the end ...

In the next scene, Lynette and her new husband are riding on horseback to view the Pyramids ... They stop and kiss on horseback, then climb to the top of a Pyramid. Only to learn as they reach the top, Jacqueline is there, waiting for them, giving details about the structure as if she were a tour guide and laughing as she views their discomfort and irritation by her surprise appearance. She is their nemesis, tracking down their moves and showing up, when they least expect it ... playing the spurned female lover to perfection. The couple manage to trick her into going to the railroad station, as they back track and return to the hotel, to board their boat for the cruise ... The upper class never looked so grand and haughty as the various actors and actresses play their roles when boarding for their cruise ... One learns nearly every passenger has a grudge against either Mrs. Doyle (aka Lynette Ridgeway) or her father who left his wealth to her. They all resent or hate her for some reason or another ... On a tour of some ruins, the passengers feign interest in the huge columns and carved structures, when they are all eyeing the antics of the newlyweds, the Doyle couple, as they wander around the site. A scream from Mrs. Doyle arouses everyone's attention, as they run to see what happened, a huge boulder, had toppled from one of the columns and nearly crushed her ... Hercule Poirot's instincts are aroused, his attention to detail and memory, like a steel trap, is put into over-drive ...

Ms Jacqueline makes her grand dramatic entrance at a tour site along the way and she comes on board ... to haunt the Doyles. She gets drunk one evening, threatens Mr. Doyle after his wife had gone to bed. Jacqueline loses control, whips out her pistol and shoots him in the leg. After this event, she is led back to her cabin, emotionally distraught and nearly hysterical. A passenger who is a nurse is awakened to stay with her all night, she injects Jacqueline with Morphine ... Mr. Doyle is taken to the doctor's cabin for treatment ... And shortly thereafter, Lynette Doyle is discovered murdered, shot in the head, with the same pistol used to shoot Mr. Doyle.

This is the first murder on board and Hercule Poirot has his work cut out for him, as *everyone* is a suspect ... Nearly all the passengers have motive and most had the opportunity to do it, except the *obvious* suspect, Jacqueline who was guarded by the nurse in her cabin. In true Agatha Christie fashion, the clues are examined by Mr. Poirot. Everyday life on board the boat becomes more tense and frightening. Even Hercule Poirot's life is threatened by a live cobra in his bathroom ... In the end, there are five total deaths on board. The last two occur after Hercule Poirot reveals who the murderer is: amazingly, the murderer and accomplice end up dying. This is a very fine film with enough twists and turns to satisfy any ""who dun it"" murder mystery fan. The film has magnificent long shot scenery, great actors and actresses, superb winding plot and colorful characters played to perfection, one can ask no more of a film!

530068,5,6302990114,"Many reviewers have talked about the good cast and their work in this movie, but I didn't find reviewers evaluating the soundness of the movie's argument. Either people did not seem to pay attention to the way the movie's assassinations were solved or they simply took it as it was without complains or contradicting the movie; this is impressive. I've seen several other reviews and Agatha's novel movies are the first products I found without much objections (if any at all). I also like very much all the cast's performances, but I got much more interested in the movie's logic.

Then, I repeated the movie's end and some other scenes a few times to look for incongruence or flawed reasoning, it was fun. Besides I wasn't quite satisfied with the case explanation and I wanted to imagine how another one of the several murder suspects could still have done the crimes. However, the hero's (detective Hercule Poirot) logics to discover the bad guys stood to reason all along. It was rather the Poirot's assumptions about the suspects that were far out. For example, Poirot regarded one man (the Marxist) as a suspect just because he had been dishing out the killed victim. Poirot's basic idea to point anybody as a suspect was that a person could kill at the immediate chance of having a gun and nobody watching. Fortunately, most people don't kill that easily. Just look at a nation with gun rights like USA, which is relatively peaceful; despite so many news on crime this nation, it would be giant cemetery if people behaved as Poirot regards humans.

Thus that was the characteristic off in the movie, people are assumed to behave in more violent ways than they really do and the real bad guys' plans are way too far out. Nonetheless, this same characteristic makes the movie even more interesting to watch, because everybody could be a waco over there but logics stands still and help solve the case.

By the way, although most people have enjoyed this movie some stated that the former Agatha's movie (Murder in the Orient Express) was better. They didn't say quite clear why such preference but I guess it simply because two of the movie's characters (Poirot and the Doctor) spoke too many words in their mother tongues, French and German. I suggest you not to pay attention to those picky details, this movie was better than the Orient Express. This movie had fair jokes, much more light, several pretty and interesting scenarios in Egypt, a boat and England; the characters were less creepy and Poirot was able to prove his theory. The other movie (Orient's) is totally the opposite, everything takes place in dark scenarios within only a train (it was a saddening scenario despite being all luxury) and Poirot's case resolution was more awesome than at Nile's but could not provide real evidences. Yes, this movie was better. Just consider that virtually nobody is paying attention to the  movie's logics (as they do in the other one) but rather to the scenario and cast.",1141344000,2,2983,4.797665369649805

530071,4,6302990114,"This second outing by John Brabourne and Richard Goodwin is no where near their first, Murder on the Orient Express.  But it is still a great mystery.  The style of the movie is identical to the first, prelude followed by gathering of the cast, then a murder or two and finally a gathering of suspects and unmasking of the killer(s).  The only difference is Albert Finney did not want to reprise his fabulous interpretation of Hercule Poirot, instead they have Peter Ustinov.  Ustinov makes a very good Poirot and needs little change physically.  Ustinov would recreate this role in two more feature films and four more television adaptions.

As the film starts we meet heiress Lynette Ridgeway (Lois Chiles).  Her best friend Jackie De Bellefort (Mia Farrow) is engaged to Simon Doyle (Simon MacCorkindale).  Lynette gives Simon a job at her estate and ends up marrying him!  They decide to honeymoon in Egypt and a steamer up the Nile.

Now we assemble the suspects.  We meet Andrew Pennington, Lynette's trustee (George Kennedy), who has embezzled from her and needs to cover it up.  This is followed by Mrs. Van Schuyler (Bette Davis) and her paid companion Bowers (Maggie Smith) whose father was ruined by Lynette's family.  Mrs. Van Schuyler has a fascination of Lynette's pearls. And of course the perfect honeymoon guest, the jilted lover, Jackie.  Of course, Poirot needs an assistant Colonel Race (David Niven).  Also on board is Lynette's maid Louise (Jane Birkin), anarchist Mr. Ferguson (Jon Finch), Dr. Ludwig Besser (Jack Warden) whose clinic Lynette is trying to shut down, novelist Salome Otterbourne (Angela Lansbury) who was being sued by Lynette and her daughter Rosalie (Olivia Hussey).

The plot is fairly typical Christie, murder attempt, red herrings, murder, additional murders and the solving of the murder.

As usual, the plot is overly complex but all the clues are right there in front of you.  This is deliciously fun.  The stand outs are Angela Lansbury and Maggie Smith.  Lansbury is over the top as the over the top potboiler writer.  This lead to her much more subdued turn as Christie's other main stream sleuth, Miss Marple.  Which lead to the role that made her a household name, Murder, She Wrote's Jessica Fletcher.

Maggie Smith is perfect as Bette Davis' bitchy paid companion.  It is not often that Bette Davis got upstaged in films.  In this one, Smith just runs over her with her perfectly time quips. Smith won the Oscar that year for California Suite but I think this was much better.

Orient Express was the perfect murder mystery move.  Death on the Nile is a deliciously fun mystery.",1134864000,4,2632,4.909297052154195

530074,5,6302990114,"If you can accept this adaptation of Agatha Christie's ""Death on the Nile"" in the spirit it was intended, you'll have a good time. Faithful followers of her great books may find a lot of little details to nit-pick over but as a fun murder mystery this one is truly grand.

The production is visually pleasing and the star-studded cast are all fun to watch. At its center is Peter Ustinov's fine portrayel of Christie's greatest creation, Hercule Poirot. His interpretation of the Belgian detective with the little grey cells is both smart and humorous. The film is great fun for murder mystery fans.

On vacation in Egypt, Poirot overhears one conversation after another about the rich and selfish Lynette. It seems almost everyone has a reason for wanting her dead. Among Lynette's many trophies is her best friend's boyfriend. She is suing a sexpot writer for slander, is on the verge of finding out her attorney is swindling her, and is keeping her servant girl from happiness with another. Poirot knows this trip to Egypt will be no vacation when Mia Farrow, the jilted lover of Lynette's husband, tells him: ""If love can't live in your heart, evil will do just as well.""

The period production is sumptuous in its presentation of both Egypt and their excursion by boat down the beautiful Nile River. It is resplendent and elegant fun and the cast is allowed to play it out with gusto. Ustinov gives Poirot a droll humor even after a close brush with a cobra, planted in his cabin by the murderer.

Angela Lansbury and Betty Davis both ham it up in appropriate fashion and Lois Chiles is good as the not so deep Lynette. Jack Warden, George Kennedy, Maggie Smith, Olivia Hussey, and John Finch join David Niven, as Poirot's old pal, in a great ensemble cast of movie legends.

If you have a couple of hours to kill and want an old-fashioned and entertaining murder mystery to pass the time with, this one will definitely do the trick. This trip down the Nile is a lot of fun.",1123804800,41,1979,4.626780626780627

530102,4,6302990114,"Like many other reviewers, I have a deep affection for the character of hercule poirot and am quick to point out any inconsistencies between the actor portraying him and my own vision of him.  Death on the Nile is the first movie in which I saw peter ustinov in the role (other christie productions with him as poirot pale incredibly in comparison to this one).  At first I thought he was terribly miscast, mainly because he didn't look the part and his ""belgian"" accent was so phony. However, after seeing this movie a few times, his performance has grown on me; he adds much needed playful humor to the movie which I think is present in much of Christie's books, but many times lost in the movie/tv versions, especially those with David Suchet (who is much too serious for my taste).  I think ustinov plays well the whole ""papa poirot"" side of the character.  Mia Farrow, Maggie Smith and the other big names did a pretty good job, but I think the Egyptian landscape was the real star of this production, and, of course, the incredibly clever twisting plot.  I'm giving four stars because this is one of the more well made christie productions; my favorite is murder on the orient express with albert finney, who, down to the limp (a war injury mentioned in the mysterious affair at styles), was, in my mind, a nearly perfect poirot.",1120608000,,1335,4.592436974789916

No.  Are they a great introduction to Agatha Christie?  Hell, yes!  Sure, there are some minor glitches and a few over-the-top acting faux pas, but overall, this is a great movie.

You'll never for a moment believe that Ustinov is playing anybody but Ustinov, well outside the character and almost strictly for laughs.  Likewise, Davis and Smith have a go at each other as travelling companions (Davis looks remarkably like the aged version of her character in ""Mr. Skeffington"" from the 1940's!).

But top honors in the scenery-chewing department go to bug-eyed, grandiosely bizarre Lansbury, who would later play Christie's Miss Marple.

There are some other second-tier stars and some nice Egyptian scenery, but you won't be able to concentrate with the aforementioned quartet around.  The film just bides its time till one of them takes over again.

530106,5,6302990114,"Beginning with a stirring overture (composed by Nino Rota) and incorporating stunning location shots of Egypt and the English countryside, John Guillermin's DEATH ON THE NILE (1978) boasts a star-studded cast.  Peter Ustinov, David Niven, Lois Chiles, Mia Farrow, Bette Davis, Simon MacCorkindale, Angela Lansbury, Olivia Hussey...The only other movie version of an Agatha Christie mystery that rivals this one for the glamour of its cast is Sidney Lumet's MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS (1974).  And just as that movie was enriched by the likes of Martin Balsam and Richard Widmark, this one has such great character actors as Maggie Smith and Jack Warden in supporting roles.  The story, based on Christie's own favorite of her novels, concerns a love triangle that is not quite what it appears to be.  All three members of the triangle, along with famed Belgian (not French!) detective Hercule Poirot (Ustinov), his friend Colonel Race (Niven), and a host of others, end up in Egypt, and then on a ship traveling up the Nile.  This is where the beautiful, wealthy, and unscrupulous Linnet Ridgeway Doyle (Chiles) is murdered.  The problem Poirot faces is that nearly all of the passengers had motives for Linnet's murder, and the most likely suspect - her wronged friend Jacqueline (Farrow) - had a water-tight alibi.
Though Ustinov is not my favorite Poirot - that would be David Suchet - he was a wonderful actor and I LIKE his Poirot better than Albert Finney's (in MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS).  He is full of savoir-faire, and egotistical but never obnoxious.  He can also be deadly serious, as when warning Jacqueline not to allow ""evil"" into her heart.  Niven's urbane appearance and dry wit (Race to Poirot:  ""Yes, I'd forgotten your opinion about yourself""); Lansbury's deliciously over-the-top acting as Salome Otterbourne, writer of ""trashy"" romantic novels; Hussey's winsome vulnerability as her neglected daughter, Rosalie; Davis' likeable prickliness as Mrs. Van Schuyler, a rich dowager with a penchant for pearls; Warden's remarkable accent and manner as the German Dr. Bessner; and Chiles' flawless beauty are among the other memorable things in the movie.  Under Guillermin's direction, the action flows to its shocking and tragic conclusion.  With a script by playwright Anthony Shaffer (SLEUTH), this DEATH ON THE NILE was the perfect follow-up to the rightly acclaimed MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS.",1101859200,2,2421,5.211340206185567

In the story, Agatha Christie's famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot (played by the brilliant actor Peter Ustinov, 1921-2004), is vacationing in Egypt.  As part of his vacation, Poirot rides a steamer named the Karnak down the Nile River and visits a number of ancient Egyptian sites along with an assortment of other guests on board.  Played by an all-star cast, the other guests include the elderly & wealthy Marie Van Schuyler (the incomparable Bette Davis, 1908-1989), her nurse/assistant Miss Bowers (Maggie Smith), the very wealthy Linnet Ridgeway Doyle (Lois Chiles), her newly-wedded husband Simon Doyle (Simon MacCorkindale), her maid Louise Bourget (Jane Birkin), Simon's ex-girlfriend Jacqueline De Bellefort (Mia Farrow), the noted romance author Salome Otterbourne (Angela Lansbury, who has often played one of Agatha Christie's other memorable detectives Miss Jane Marple in the 1980 film ""The Mirror Crack'd""), her daughter Rosalie Otterbourne (Olivia Hussey), boyfriend James Ferguson (Jon Finch), businessman Andrew Pennington (George Kennedy), Colonel Johnny Race (David Niven, 1910-1983), Doctor Ludwig Bessner (Jack Warden) and the Manager of The Karnak (I.S. Johar, 1920-1984).  The mysterious murder of Linnet on board the steamer begins an investigation by Poirot, who is assisted by Colonel Race, and leads to many interesting possible motives by many of the guests.  Can Poirot solve the mystery before anyone else might be murdered?  You'll just have to watch this compelling film to find out.

Filmed in Egypt, the views of Egypt along the Nile are breathtakingly beautiful as the mysterious story in the film unfolds.  The film won its only Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design (Anthony Powell).  It was also nominated for several BAFTA awards, including Best Actor (for Peter Ustinov) and two separate nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Angela Lansbury and Maggie Smith).  Anthony Powell again won the BAFTA for Best Costume Design.  Memorable scenes in the film include the visit to Temple of Karnak, the visit to the four statues of Ramses II, the discovery of the murder, Poirot's questioning of various guests and the final scenes of the film.

Overall, I rate ""Death on the Nile"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to any mystery film aficionado.  Peter Ustinov was always brilliant in any role he played and is sorely missed. It is also probably the best film that John Guillermin ever directed.",1096329600,,2677,5.345238095238095
530109,5,6302990114,"To my mind, Peter Ustinov is Hercule Poirot. He may not bear much resemblence to the character famed mystery writer Agatha Christie described him in the many novels in which he appeared, but Ustinov made the role his own in a series of movies in the late 1970s through to the late 1980s - of which DEATH ON THE NILE is the first.

 Brought to the screen by the same team who entertained four years earlier with the MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS production that headlined Albert Finney as Belgium's most famous literary detective among a high calibver all-star cast, the 1978 production of ""Death on the Nile"" also presented an impressive group of veteran actors (such as David Niven) to ypung and upcoming stars such as actress Lois Chiles (who would go on a year later to appear in the blockbuster MOONRAKER).

 Chiles plays the victim in this riddle of a mystery, a spoilt heiress who seems to have the misfortune of having taken a cruise with a boatload of people the majority of whom all have a reason to kill her. It's up to Poirot to navigate his way through all the red herrings and clues and come up with a conclusion that is just as shocking and ingenious as any that has ever been brought to the screen.

 This is my favorite of all the Christie adaptations, the entire cast is uniformly excellent, the direction solid and the locations awe inspiring.

 Also of note is the inclusion of a MAKING OF... vintage featurette made to coincide with the movle's release as well as an interview with Ustinov.

 All in all, well worth a look by mystery fans and a definite purchase by Christie devotees.",1091059200,10,1603,4.554006968641115
530110,5,6302990114,"+++++

I watched this 1978 movie of 140 minutes without first reading the 1937 Dame Agatha Christie novel (of the same name) that it was based on.  I'm glad I did this!  Why?  Because it forced me to really watch the movie in order to try and deduce who the murderer was.

As a brief synopsis, the movie begins with ""Jacquline ('Jackie') De Bellafort"" (Mia Farrow) telling her very wealthy friend ""Linnet Ridgeway"" (Lois Chiles) about the man ""Simon Doyle"" (Simon MacCorkindale) she has fallen in love with.  Linnet falls for Simon and they eventually marry.  Their honeymoon is on a riverboat (technically called a 'paddle steamer') called the ""S.S. Karnak"" that takes then down the Nile River in Egypt. Aboard the boat, besides the three mentioned above, are ""Hercule Poirot"" (Sir Peter Ustinov) and his good friend ""Colonel Johnny Race"" (David Niven).  There are other passengers on board who all dislike Linnet.

Linnet is murdered.  Eventually two other passengers are also murdered.  Poirot has to solve who the killer is.  For both Poirot and the viewer, it's obvious that the killer is no ""Simple Simon.""

Who are these passengers?  Besides the five mentioned above, they are as follows:

(1) Louise Bourget, Linnet's Maid (Jane Birkin)
(2) Socialite Marie Van Schayler (Bette Davis)
(3) Miss Bowers (Maggie Smith), Aid to Marie
(4) Marxist James Ferguson (Jon Finch)
(5) Romance Novelist Salome Otterbourne (Angela Lansbury)
(6) Rosalie Otterbourne (Olivia Hussey), Salome's daughter
(7) Lawyer Andrew Pennington (George Kennedy), Linnet's uncle
(8) Dr. Ludwig Bessner (Jack Warden)
(9) Manager of the Karnak (I.S. Johar)

Of the fourteen actors mentioned above, Ustinov's performance stands out.  This was his debut performance as Poirot and I feel he does a stellar job being both serious and comical at the same time.  Other performances to look for are Mia Farrow as the ex-fiance and Angela Lansbury as the perpetually drunk novelist.

The cinematography of this movie is visually stunning.  We especially get to see the Sphinx, the Pyramids, and the ancient ruins of Egypt.  The costume design is elegant.  The main background music adds to this movie as well.

Listen for gags that run throughout this movie.  For example, Poirot is Belgian but is always confused as being French.  One of my favorite pieces of dialogue is where a passenger gets angry at the great sleuth:

Van Schayler: You perfectly foul French upstart!
  Poirot: Belgian upstart, please madam.

As Poirot attempts to solve the crime, we are shown what might have happened.  Unfortunately, there is some unintended humor as Linnet continually gets shot (in the head) as Poirot goes through each possible scenario.  I found this somewhat distracting.

Finally, the DVD (which has the movie in widescreen format) has five extras.  I found that the only one that was interesting was about the making of this movie.  It lasts about 25 minutes.

In conclusion, this is a fun movie, even if you have read the book it's based on!!

I particularly like David Niven and Mia Farrow in this one, and Maggie Smith who seems to always be good.  If you're a Poirot fan then this is must see.

As ""Death on the Nile"" opens, we meet Linnet Ridgeway--young, beautiful, rich, and single--shortly before she meets Simon Doyle, the fiance of her good friend Jackie de Bellefort.  We soon see Simon on honeymoon--with Linnet, not Jackie.  Simon and Linnet board a steamer for a cruise down the Nile, along with several other passengers--including Jackie, who has been tracking the newlyweds on their honeymoon, and who seems to have gone over the edge in her jealousy and anger.
Also on board are the famous detective Hercule Poirot, and his old friend Col. Johnny Race of the British Secret Service.  And a good thing, too.  Late one night, Jackie, in a fit of hysteria, shoots and wounds Simon, and is then taken to her cabin and sedated.  The next morning, Linnet is found shot to death in her cabin.  Jackie would be the obvious suspect, but she couldn't possibly have done it.  And so the great Hercule Poirot has another complex case to unravel...
""Death on the Nile"" is one of Christie's very best novels, and even with a simplified plot--fans of the novel will not the absence of several characters and at least two sizable subplots--the natural strength of the source material makes for a very enjoyable movie.  It falls short of the very top because of some unsatisfactory casting.  Peter Ustinov is no more than an adequate Poirot, falling short of either Albert Finney or David Suchet.  At times he seems to rely largely on his eavesdropping talents, not his ""little grey cells.""  Nor is David Niven a good choice for Col. Race--he is too dapper and elegant to portray Christie's ""man of unadvertised comings and goings.""
However, the supporting cast is quite strong.  Mia Farrow, as Jackie, gives the standout performance.  Lois Chiles, best remembered today as a Bond Girl, didn't have great range as an actress, but the lovely ex-model had the right personality for the arrogant Linnet.  Bette Davis and Angela Lansbury also stand out.
The film won an Oscar for best costumes.  Nino Rota contributed an atmospheric score, and John Guillermin directs ably.  The Egyptian locations--most of the film was shot there--provide a stunning backdrop.
On the whole, this is a very enjoyable movie.  It is clearly the best of Peter Ustinov's several outings in the role of Poirot.",1057276800,2,2554,4.913752913752914
530143,3,6302990114,"This big screen treatment of mystery author Agatha Christie's best-seller is dinstinguished by the first appearance of Peter Ustinov as the world famous sleuth, Hercule Periot. Though the film version of ""Death on the Nile"" doesn't rise to the quality of its immediate predecessor, ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" it is still a worthy trip with a boatful of nouveau rich upper classers who all have a motive to kill a filthy rich heiresss (Lois Childs). When she actually come up with a bullet to her head while sleeping, suspicion falls on her husband's spurned ex-fiancee (Mia Farrow, in a slightly nerve-trying overacting job) and an all-star passenger list headed by Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, Angela Lansbury and Olivia Hussey. Enter Inspector Periot and David Niven as another sleuth aiding in the investigation. Though the ""who did it"" isn't a surpise, the ""how they did it"" is, and that solution makes the film an enjoyable watch. Additionally, there's some stunning scenary of Egypt and along the Nile, and Ustinov's personification of the fabled detective is worthy. He shows up again in subsequent film versions of some of Christie's other novels, and this is one of Ustinov's better efforts.",1043712000,,1203,5.08080808080808
530144,3,6302990114,"When heiress Lynette Doyle (Lois Chiles) is murdered during a Nile cruise, it is up to super-sleuth Hercule Poirot (Peter Ustinov) to seperate the culprit from the many suspects who had reason to want her dead.  I have never been a fan of the ""cozy mystery"" sub-genre that was Agatha Christie's forte, in which suspects are bumped off at regular intervals until the detective gathers everyone in the drawing room to reveal his solution of the crime.  Therefore, I am not the proper audience for this film.  The cast is certainly impressive and the production is smooth.  I enjoyed the beginning of the film quite a bit; it takes on the air of a smart, elegant comedy of manners as the foibles and interrelationships of the various characters are introduced.  However, I began losing interest after the murder of the heiress, as the mystery aspects of the story asserted themselves, grinding formulaicly to an implausible conclusion./",1040515200,,933,4.955128205128205
530145,5,6302990114,"Although the ""mystery"" isn't that intriguing, the performances from this star-studded film, the magnificent locations, and the superb Rota score make up for any deficits in the movie.
Ustinov, though not the physical embodiment of Christie's Poirot, is quite good at his interpretation of the Belgian sleuth. His sharp twinkle of the eyes, though reminiscent of a beardless Santa, still resonates a mind at work. It is good to see David Niven, one of the most elegant actors ever to grace the silver screen, in a supporting yet significant part. Veterans George Kennedy and Jack Warden are also on hand as respective ""suspects"" in the death of heiress Lois Chiles.
But, the acting nods go to a quartet of heavyweight grand dames of film: Angela Lansbury is a delight in the role of an eccentric lush of an author seemingly obsessed with sex; Bette Davis as a kleptomaniac dowager with designs on Chiles' baubles again shows why she is at the top of the women of Hollywood; and Maggie Smith as Davis's assistant is a joy as she trades barbs with her employer. Even though Mia Farrow is younger than the aforementioned, she still shows that she can hold her own in the role of a scorned woman with plans of her own. These women know how to deliver an award-winning performance.",1034380800,,1275,4.747747747747748
530146,4,6302990114,"Death on the Nile takes the viewer on a genteel cruise aboard the paddle-steamer 'Karnak' as it, along with its motley collection of passengers, wends its way through the stunning scenery of historic Egypt. Unfortunately on this voyage the Nile proves to have disturbing currents, and a wealthy heiress with a propensity for making enemies is shot. Corpulent Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot is on hand, and, as the body-count rises, must tax his legendary 'little grey cells' to the limit in order to expose the assassin in their midst.
The charm of this film is that to most of the audience it will be foreign in both time and place. The Egyptian location provides a visual feast, with visits to the pyramids, the inscrutable sphinx, and the eerie wailing statue of Ramses II at Abu Simbel. Scenery like this makes it somewhat easier to forgive the movie its overlong running time of almost 2  hours. The story (originally penned by Agatha Christie) is set in the 1930s - the golden age of detective fiction - when murder investigations were much less clinical affairs than they are today. In an era before DNA sampling, Poirot uses the narratively more interesting approach of involving suspects in conversation, and reading between the lines.
The cast is certainly star-studded, but unfortunately several of the characters tend towards stereotypes. However, there are some wonderful performances by several of the silver screen's grandes dames - Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, and particularly Angela Lansbury as the inebriated author of appallingly bad romance novels.
Although a little slow initially, various techniques (such as dead silence being used as the ultimate suspense music) keep the viewer's interest piqued right through until Christie's trademark denouement.",1030924800,,1771,5.2140350877192985
530147,4,6302990114,"OK, those died-in-the-wool Christie fans had better give this a miss and stick with David Suchet.
But, just as Margaret Rutherford did a totally unauthentic, but delightful, version of Miss Marple, Peter Ustinov gives us an equally enchanting version of Hercule Poirot.
No, it's not Christie's Poirot, but it's still a lot of fun.
Christie's plot is basically kept in tact, but it is the all-star performance which, for once, shines through.
David Niven does a wonderfully English 'Hastings' impersonation (far more interesting than the original character in the book in fact). Bette Davis and Maggie Smith do star turns as the NY matron and her companion , but the whole film is stolen by Angela Lansbury as the alcoholic 'romantic' novelist, Salome Otterbourne. Her 'authentic' tango with David Niven is a cinematic classic.
The idea the 'everyone could have done it' is rather laboured, but if you can suspend disbelief, this film is loads of fun.
If you like your Christie with panashe, then this is the film for you.",1011916800,,1021,4.976608187134503
530148,3,6302990114,"Agatha Christie's complex MURDER ON THE NILE comes to the screen with the obligatory star-studded cast and a script that--while reasonably faithful to the original story--sacrifices the novels' sense of atmosphere and one of Christie's more celebrated plots for the sake of broad performances with a comic tone.  The story focuses on a romantic triangle, with Mia Farrow in the role of a young woman who has been cast aside and now stalks her ex-lover and his wealthy wife on their honeymoon, even going so far as to book passage on a tourist ship with the couple.  Needless to say, the newlyweds take a dim view of her presence, and the tension of the situation errupts into murder.
Peter Ustinov is obviously miscast in the role of Hercule Poriot and therefore plays the role for humor; much the same may be said of David Niven in the role of Johnny Race, a character clearly adapted from the Capt. Hastings of several Christie novels.  Like Ustinov, Mia Farrow is poorly cast in the role of the woman wronged, but the supporting cast--including Bette Davis, Angela Landsbury, George Kennedy, and Maggie Smith--offer good value; their over-the-top performances make the film quite watchable.
This adaptation is truly ""Christie-Lite,"" an effort to cash in on the popularity of the earlier film MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS without going to the same effort.  It's mindless fun at best, and many will enjoy it as such, but those expecting a fullfledged adaptation of a Christie classic will be more than a little disappointed.",1008892800,16,1525,4.9221789883268485
530149,4,6302990114,"Agatha Christie wrote ""Death on the Nile"" in 1937, one year after ""Murder in Mesopotamia"", and to all appearances ""Death on the Nile"" was intended as a prequel to ""Murder in Mesopotamia"", which itself was a prequel to the 1934 classic ""Murder in the Orient Express"". The three stories make up a satisfying trilogy of mysteries as Poirot tours the Near East finding murder everywhere he goes.
All three of the stories follow Christie's tried-and-true formula: She introduces the cast of suspects, gives each of them a dark secret and a motive to lie, and piles up the circumstances in such a way that the flying fickle finger of suspicion points to every one of them at some time or another. She compounds the confusion by supplying false leads and deliberatly glossing over hot clues. In each case Poirot holds his cards close to his vest, tantalizes the reader/listener with cryptic comments, and finds the most inconsequential-appearing facts to be highly significant. Eventually Poirot airs everyone's dirty laundry, explains his chain of deductive reasoning, reconstructs the crime in all its improbable complexity, and gets a confession.
Of the three stories, however, ""Death on the Nile"" presents the most feasible modus operandi for the murder, as well as the most likely motivation for murder. This is a roudabout way of saying that ""Death on the Nile"" is the most realistic of the three.
The Peter Ustinov movie stays faithful to the plot and gives the viewer some excellent scenes of Egyptian ruins along the Nile.  The star-studded cast turns in good performances.  Having first seen David Suchet as Poirot, I could not help but be somewhat disappointed with Peter Ustinov as Poirot.  Of all the Poirot movies starring Ustinov, however, this is the best.",1005696000,45,1765,5.017064846416382

530173,3,6302990114,"Fans of murder mysteries, especially those of Agatha Christie, will want to check out this mystery about the murder of an American heiress (played by Lois Chiles) on board a boat sailing down the Nile.  Almost all the passengers on board have a reason to do away with her, and someone does the deed.  It's up to passenger and sleuth extraordinaire Hercule Poirot, this time played by Peter Ustinov, to exercise his little gray cells to find the answer as the bodies begin to pile up.  The mystery itself is quite entertaining to try and solve, with enough surprises to more than keep your attention.  Ustinov brings humour to the Poirot character, and is amusing in a different take on the famed fictional detective.  The supporting cast is filled with terrific actors, but unfortunately, they're not given much individual screen time to establish their characters.  However, Angela Lansbury as the drunken author of steamy romance novels has a field day with her character, staggering from scene to scene to great effect.  Mia Farrow also gets some juicy scenes.  Bette Davis and Maggie Smith, as wealthy, jewellery loving old woman and her much put upon nurse, have a great chemistry together, insulting each other with style, but they aren't given much else to do.  It's not often you see Davis blending into the background!!  Others, like Jack Warden, David Niven, George Kennedy, and Olivia Hussey, are effective in underwritten roles.  Victim Lois Chiles is quite stiff and doesn't deliver much of a performance at all.  But apart from not fleshing out the characters enough, the film maintains the suspense, is great to look at (great scenery and costumes), is well scored, and the climax of the mystery is quite satisfying.  Also, as an aside, it is unusually violent for a Christie story/movie, with repeated shots of murders.  All in all, it's good, but not great mystery entertainment.",996278400,2,1896,4.958860759493671
530174,5,6302990114,"The video tape of <Death on the Nile> has long been available, although the widescreen edition was hard to find except on such channels as AMC and TCM. Now I am delighted to find that star-studded film on DVD with the Anchor Bay label.  As has been pointed out by many, this plot fits the Agatha Christie pattern in which an isolated group of people (on an island, a train, a boat) experience murder and the guilty party must be one of themselves. In one of them, they ALL did it. In two of them, the detective did it. In one of them the only two who could not have possibly done it did it. In the slim case you do not know the solution to ""Death on the Nile,"" I will say no more.
  As with ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" the period dcor is just about perfect and each one of the Big Names in the cast gets at least two good scenes in which to do their thing. Possibly Maggie Smith can be singled out as giving us the most subtly comical character in many a film. Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, pulls out all the stops as the forever tipsy author of sex novels. And indeed the entire project has an obvious blend of comedy that helps make this (perhaps) a bit more watchable than was the far more serious ""Orient Express"" that had preceded it. (How seriously can you take a film in which the manager of the cruise ship exclaims ""Goody goody gumdrops"" when they dredge up the murder weapon?) (And how did the villain acquire a live cobra aboard the ship?)
  There is no point in comparing Ustinov's Poirot with Finney's in the ""Orient Express"" film, since they both are very good in their own ways and neither had David Suchet with whom to contend. What is a good example of missed opportunity is one of the DVD's bonus features that gives us an interview in Spanish with Ustinov in which he is not really being asked the right questions to elicit any really interesting answers. A similar interview with Jane Birkin proves even less enlightening.
  Among the DVD extras is a not-bad 24 minute ""Making Of"" short, the original trailer, and some short but detailed printed bios of the cast, included Harry Andrews, who shows up for only a few moments at the film's start.
  All in all, this is a DVD I know I will view many times in the future, as I have done with the full screen tape edition, but with far greater satisfaction.
  As a footnote, I should mention that Audio Partners has released a reading of the complete novel with David Suchet as narrator and the entire cast. It always makes a fascinating game to see what changes the film has to make to simplify things.",987379200,6,2578,4.35
530175,4,6302990114,"""DEATH ON THE NILE""
Yet another story of a murdered millionaire heiress, but this time, the movie has a much bigger budget (than ""Endless Night""), a screenplay by Anthony Schaeffer, exotic Egyptian locations and a star-studded cast that includes Bette Davis, David Niven, Angelea Lansbury, Mia Farrow, Olivia Hussey and Lois Chiles.
Peter Ustinov is droll, meticulous, Belgian master sleuth Hercule Poirot taking a cruise down the Nile on the S.S. Karnak. And, as is often the case when he goes on holiday, someone dies. Soon, all the rich passengers are suspects in the murder of Linnet Ridgeway.  Can he find the culprit before the boat docks?  Of course.  But you will be surprised at his revelation -- and the number of bodies that fall along the way!
Director John Guillerman works hard to balance the Christie formula of character over plot. The movie works and is a delight.
A highlight is Nino Rota's memorable score that cleverly riffs the chugging of the steam powered boat heading up river. Jack Cardiff's cinematography perfectly evokes 1932. (UK, Color, Widescreen, 140 Minutes, Rated PG, 1978)",985478400,5,1107,5.038251366120218
530176,5,6302990114,"The novel Death On The Nile ranks as my favorite of all of the Christie novels I've read, and so I was hoping that this movie was faithful to the original material. I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed.
The performances of the many actors are great. Simon MacCorkindale's portrayal of Simon Doyle is wonderful, and Angela Lansbury as Salome Otterbourne is very entertaining. Maggie Smith and Bette Davis as Miss Bowers and Miss Van Schuyler, respectively, have some wonderful scenes together and have great chemistry. David Niven as Colonel Johnny Race is great and makes for a good Watson to Poirot. Jack Warden as Dr. Bessner and Jon Finch as Jim Ferguson, while don't have a ton of screentime, still portray their characters perfectly, and of course Peter Ustinov as the great Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is great.
The scenery is beautiful. The scene where Simon and Linnet Doyle are climbing the pyramid is simply breathtaking.
The extras on the DVD are pretty good. The 24-minute featurette ""The Making of Death On The Nile"" is interesting, and the interviews (both in French with subtitles) with Peter Ustinov and Jane Birkin (who plays Louise Bourget), while not extremely interesting, are still a nice addition.
There are a few flaws in the movie. The largest one is the fact that they cut out Tim and Mrs. Allerton. For those of you who have read the book, you'll know that cutting out Tim Allerton changes a few important things. Cornelia Robson is also cut out, as well as James Fanthorp and Signor Richetti (which again changes a few things). While I did like these characters a lot in the book, during the movie, these characters were hardly missed.
The movie runs approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes, and despite the PG rating, has some slightly graphic violence in it.
I would highly reccomend buying this DVD, however, I would suggest reading the book first.",983836800,13,1882,4.8478260869565215
530177,3,6302990114,"""Death on the Nile"" should be more fun than it is. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly what it is about the film that disappoints. The cast is good, the script witty, the direction capable, the backdrops lush, luxurious and spectacular. It was obviously produced with loving care, and Christie's story provides a constantly surprising, intricate puzzle. As for the specifics of the DVD, Jack Cardiff's high-key, low-contrast photography lends itself well to video, the transfer is 16:9 enhanced, and the results are uniformly handsome.
Producers John Brabourne and Richard Goodwin repeat their ""Murder on the Orient Express"" formula. The Christie novel provides an excuse for an expensive, well-tailored cast to perform light, vaguely campy acting games. Most of the actors seem to be having fun with their parts (particularly Angela Lansbury as a drunkard author, barely standing at what seems a perpetual 45 degree angle) but the formula doesn't work for Ustinov. Or it works too well, depending on your point of view. He lacks the intensity Albert Finney brought to Poirot in ""Orient Express,""  and unlike Finney or David Suchet, he fails to lose himself in the part. We're always just a shade too aware that we're watching Ustinov performing a clever impersonation rather than forgetting him to focus on the crime. On the other hand, the humor he brings to the part may please some people more than Finney or Suchet's seriousness.
""Death on the Nile"" was the second of three Brabourne/Goodwin Poirot adaptations, the first to star Ustinov (who went on to play him in two other theatrical films, and three made-for-TV movies), and the first to introduce a note of sly humor. That may be the problem. All the adaptations of the Poirot novels tread a thin line between tongue-in-cheek knowingness and self-parody. ""Death on the Nile"" just barely avoids slipping into the full Camp theatrics that made the next film in the series, ""Evil Under the Sun"" too cute to be effective. Fortunately, the solution to the mystery is a real surprise, and there's a second, stunning twist that makes the film memorable. If the rest had been up to the ending's level of involvement, the film might have been a real stunner. As it is, ""Death on the Nile"" is enjoyable enough, just not quite as good as we want it to be.",983404800,4,2303,4.920308483290489

The actors and actresses look glamorous but are constantly upstaged by the glorious remains of pharaonic Egypt.
