8598425,1,B001CQ5FI8,"As a huge OSU fan, this DVD is really poor given the stars left OUT - Thurman Thomas, Hart Lee Dykes, Mike Gundy, Leslie O'Neal, Josh Fields, Rashaun Woods to name a few, only covers about 8-10 players and most of those players were not ""stars"" but strong contributers with the obvious exception of Barry.  The profiles that it does have are very brief - not worth the investment.",1235088000,4,380,4.507246376811594
