Though In one of the bonus match between Buddy George Vs. Jethro in the The 4 Corners Of Pain Death Match Jethro took some brutal punishment!! The bloodiest match on this video with Jethro's face and entire back gets turned into hamburger, it's was BRUTAL!!! With his high pain tolerance while loosing buckets of blood It would have been really nice to see Jethro entered in the Death Match tournament... Regardless, it's an overall good Death Match video.",1486857600,,603,4.798076923076923

8202725,4,B000RW3YYU,"I've seen a lot of death matches, and I'm a huge deathmatch fan. Volume 2 is My favorite of the deathmatch series but this ones pretty damn good! Some people may not recognize the wrestlers for they are independent but don't let that discourage you. These are some violent mo'fos! The biggest 4 names are Iwa and Ecw legend Ian Rotten, Homeless Jimmy, Xpw legend Supreme, And the most violent individual on here Evil Lonestar. The one match that stood out the most for me was the Lonestar vs Homeless Jimmy match, spoiler alert Lonestar is thrown through 2 glass shower doors. Omg! It's intense. See tables, light tubes, barbed wire, and fire. Also a vacuum cleaner. It's one insane dvd. If you love deathmatchs get it and enjoy! :)",1365724800,,732,4.638461538461539
