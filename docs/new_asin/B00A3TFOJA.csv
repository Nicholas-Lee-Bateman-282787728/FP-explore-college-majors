8546531,5,B00A3TFOJA,"quick paced, nicely done. I like all the moves and the lady's voice isn't annoying. She flows quickly from move to move describing how to do it efficiently, no nonsense.  a keeper for me. I am an experienced exerciser, a little newer to barre, and I am not strong in ballet. short update: I have been attending barre now regularly. Where I agree that the burn/shake you will get in a full hour class is not here, I still like the variety very much and don't always want an hour workout. So I rotate my videos depending on what kind of workout I want. I am not sure that advanced is the right term for this video but I do enjoy it a lot.",1433980800,,636,4.129032258064516
8546532,5,B00A3TFOJA,I purchased the 1st DVD and loved it. This one is even better and a GREAT workout!,1429574400,,82,3.8823529411764706
8546533,1,B00A3TFOJA,Bad production.  Bad sound.  Goofy warm-up.  Great instruction. Exercises are properly done.  It's just an awful video.  Could only play it 2x before deciding to toss it.,1416873600,,170,5.148148148148148
8546534,4,B00A3TFOJA,Good workout and instruction. I'm am instructor and was able to get some ideas for my class.  Worth a purchase,1392249600,2,110,4.5
8546535,4,B00A3TFOJA,"This is a really great workout!  It's a little too short and there should be more reps to be an advanced, but for a 35 minute workout, I thought it was pretty good!  I didn't pay too much attention to the people on the set; i know people have complained about one of the women.  She didn't bother me enough to not use this video.
All in all, it was a good workout and for days I only have 35 minutes, I definitely will be using this one!",1365379200,8,437,3.9431818181818183
8546536,5,B00A3TFOJA,"I really enjoy doing barre work.  As a young girl, I took ballet.  And boy does it work your abs, your butt, your thighs.  In this DVD, in addition, hand weights are added to some moves and you get a great upper body workout as well.  It is easy to follow and well taught!  One of my favorites.",1365292800,11,294,4.0
