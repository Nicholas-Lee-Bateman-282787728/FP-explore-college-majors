8156561,5,B000KGGOHC,"I love this show.  I cannot get enough of the Most Extremes, and my 7th grade students love them too.  I love ""Gluttons"" because it goes over some animals that we take for granted and presents how incredible these animals really are.  This series is very valuable, especially since it relates the animals to humans so we can see what it would be like for us if we were that animal.",1243728000,,381,4.338028169014085
