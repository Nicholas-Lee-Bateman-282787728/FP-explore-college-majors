This is a pretty fun cheesy b-movie and I recommend this to any fan of these kind of films. The picture quality is amazing with the bright and vibrant colors and the dirt specs and scratches which gives it that drive in theater feel. So grab some popcorn and beer and check this one out!",1426723200,6,412,4.1625

7908382,5,B00000FDZ5,"This picture, released in movie theaters in November 1976 starring the gorgeous and tall Jayne Kennedy as Serena, Jeannie Bell as Kelly, Playboy Playmate Rosanne Keaton as Anggie, Trina Parks as Marcie, Tony Carreon as Montiero, and John Montgomery as Turko.

Summary: The picture opens on the seas as the mothers are riding in a boat when they come across a boatload of people. The Muthers are nothing more then you are modern Pirates they go along and rob people from the seas and the ocean. Kelly tells Anggie to stand by with the gun, as the rest of the crew gets ready to go aboard. Anggie fires the gun as the people on board hit the desks as the rest of the Pirates climb a board and takes anything and everything they can get there hands on. That evening the Muthers take there boat and there very hot goods to a local harbor where they pond them off cash and supplies. While at this harbor they see there number one nemesis Turko trying to soften up some of the local government. Therefore, the next day the girls decide to attack Turko because Anggie and Kelly were getting bored. At first Turko stand his ground but is later scattered along with the rest of his men as the Muthers bring in the boat with the high power guns. So after the Muthers get back to camp Kelly is told that her younger sister Sandy has run of again her parents want Kelly to go find her. So Anggie and Kelly go looking for Sandy in a local village where they end fighting for there survival because some men don't understand what the word no means. Meanwhile, back at Kelly camp where there parents live it is attacked by Turko who's trying to find out where Kelly is. The next day as the girls are talking about what there next move is a man approaches them from the Justice Department. The man tells Kelly that a man that calls himself Montiero that has Sandy on an Island called Get out If You Can. Montiero runs the Island as a prison camp for women kidnapped her sister, and he also has as his own Serena. Now the girls have found there way on this Island and they question are they ever going to find there way off? Now a few thoughts of my own about this picture.

My Thoughts: This Movie reminded me of two others The Big Bird Cage and Terminal Island. This movie was good because it kept my interest through out the entire movie. Jeannie Bell and Rosanne Katon were very good in their roles as the leaders to the Muthers. Trina Parks was also very good as her role as Marcie who became the Muthers friends once they were in camp. I thought that Tony Carreon did a good job as the fat pig who ran the Island and kept the girls as slaves. Now for the real reason I bought this and that was Jayne Kennedy. She did fantastic job playing the role of Serena and she was gorgeous in anything she wore. Therefore, on the fact that Jayne Kennedy was the leading woman and because of her beauty I give this movie 10 weasel stars and you can buy this movie on Amazon.com",1218585600,7,2954,4.301615798922801
