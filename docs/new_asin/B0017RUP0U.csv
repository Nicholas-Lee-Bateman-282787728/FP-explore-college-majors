8267017,4,B0017RUP0U,"In a time when Doctor Who was on an extended hiatus...some of the actors and writers got together and decided to do an ""Who-like"" direct-to-video. In spite of an anemic budget and special effects...it works. Check out the series for some great appearances by past Who members. As with 70's Dr. Who, the ideas carried the show more than the effects. Well done on a shoe string.",1392768000,,376,4.626865671641791
