4987745,1,B006GVN1O4,"""I'm not a drug dealer, I'm an artist."" Glenn ""Fitz"" Fitzgerald's life
is starting to fall apart. His band is breaking up and he watches his
former mates find success while he is stuck at home selling pot to make
money. This may be my shortest review ever. This movie is 100%
improved. Unlike movies like ""Best In Show"", ""Mighty Wind"", and most of
Will Ferrell's movies this one is not funny. It may be because I'm too
old but this is not my type of movie and I thought it was lame and
boring. Overall, not for me. I give it a D.",1330473600,2,529,4.096153846153846
4987746,5,B006GVN1O4,unexpectedly hilarious. i will admit i only bought it for dylan o'brian and it ended up being a very charming funny movie. it is my go-to for when i am sad,1452297600,2,155,4.032258064516129
4987747,5,B006GVN1O4,Excellent comedy. I wasn't expecting it to be as funny as it was. The acting was great also. The action scenes were enjoyable also.,1446940800,,131,4.5

4987752,3,B006GVN1O4,For the price I'm not mad that I bought it but it's not a movie I'd recommend for someone to watch.,1420243200,,99,3.761904761904762
4987753,2,B006GVN1O4,"The actors are all first rate and known for their comic chops but the film, itself, feels forced. It's like a group of actors got together and decided to improvise the entire film. Was a script ever written? I don't think so. It meanders and you get the impression that the director continued filming even when the scenes stalled. Eventually, you start thinking.....what a waste.",1419984000,,379,4.846153846153846
4987754,5,B006GVN1O4,dude it was so worth it i don't even care please play this at my funeral,1415404800,,72,3.5625
4987755,3,B006GVN1O4,"Very strange movie, but it kept me watching to see what would happen.  Probably will not watch again.",1408406400,,101,4.611111111111111
4987765,4,B006GVN1O4,"Not typically my kind of movie, but there were some entertaining aspects to it.  It's more of a guys kind of movie.",1403222400,,115,4.2272727272727275
4987766,5,B006GVN1O4,"Dylan O'brien is one of my favorite new actors. His talent really shines in this. I didn't realize that it was mostly unscripted, and that shows the talent of these actors. Somewhat inappropriate language/themes occasionally, but that's to be expected with the theme of the movie. I love it.",1400112000,,291,4.959183673469388
4987767,5,B006GVN1O4,"This movie starts with the lead actor finding his life going all over the place as his band is breaking up, his girlfriend is pregnant and his small time weed dealership goes haywire sending him on an adventure to find life and what is important.
Running for wrong reasons being chased for wrong reasons but learning what is going on and eventually turning into a nice romantic comedy overall.  Fun and put together by the comedian himself Matt Walsh a fine leader as a director.
Enjoy.",1388361600,,486,4.651162790697675
4987768,1,B006GVN1O4,"I couldn't even finish this movie.  And I watch lots of bad movies.  How this great cast all read the script and went ""this will be great!"" is unfathomable.",1368144000,2,156,4.344827586206897
4987769,1,B006GVN1O4,There is absolutely no point to this movie.  It's not funny and there is no real story line.  Don't waste your time on this one.,1361836800,,128,4.08
4987770,5,B006GVN1O4,"Almost a perfect movie. I laughed pretty freakin' hard at a lot of the jokes, and the plot kept moving along at a decent pace. The fact that the script was improved only adds to the humor. Oh - the soundtrack was excellent. I want to find it and purchase it only for the sound the drag queen dad sings towards the end.",1358035200,,318,4.063492063492063
4987771,4,B006GVN1O4,"I thought this movie was hilarious the first time that I had watched it. It's not for everyone, but if you are looking for a good movie to watch on the weekend and you are looking for a comedy to watch. I would suggest this one, since I personally liked it and I'm definitely into comedies. I absolutely loved the parts where they were going to Oakland. :)

Recommending the movie to some of my friends.",1341532800,,403,4.302631578947368
4987772,5,B006GVN1O4,"This movie is FUNNY.  I don't think I am the target audience for this movie, but I found it hilarious - laugh til you cry.  I have never been a huge fan of improv but this story seems to have a path, and it is so good that it makes me want to take another look at some other improv movies!

I think this movie is perfect for watching with friends.  The laughing can be contagious when watching - so don't choke on your popcorn!  If you have a chance to see this in a theater - the theater will be FULL of laughter and joy.  Great movie!!",1331683200,3,537,3.925925925925926
4987773,4,B006GVN1O4,"I was one of the lucky ones to see this movie in a theater, and I laughed my ass off!!!  I'm a huge fan of Improv and UCB, so when I finally saw this movie there was no surprise that I would love it. After purchasing and watching it again I caught some subtle jokes that I didn't get before due to the fast pace and the fast dialogue.  This is a type of movie that grows on you, like Grandma's Boy.  At first I hated Grandma's Boy and thought it was the stupidest movie I have ever seen.  Then I watched it with some friends who enjoyed it, and we laughed til we cried.  High Road is shot like another Improv movie from a few years back called Cyrus (Matt Walsh, the director of High Road was also in Cyrus) but where Cyrus was a mopey melodrama, High Road plays out like a French Farce.  The plot really doesn't matter, but it's the actions of the characters and listening to their dialogue that really makes the movie shine.  Watch it with some friends and pay attention, or else you'll miss the funny.",1331596800,,1004,4.170984455958549
4987774,5,B006GVN1O4,"I have to completely disagree with the previous reviewer. I just went to a screening of this film in NYC and found this movie to be absolutely hilarious. Maybe I'm of a younger generation than the previous reviewer but I wasn't the only one who seemed to enjoy this film. The theatre was sold out, had a very diverse mix of all shapes, sizes & ages in the audience and the laughter never stopped. Everyone seemed to really enjoy it. Its clear that this film is a very low budget indie and I went in not expecting much, but I found the ensemble cast very entertaining and the story surprisingly sweet ~ which is why I came on here to purchase some copies for friends! I loved it.",1330732800,7,678,4.3046875

8497815,3,B006GVN1O4,"This movie isn't the best, but I only paid like $5 for it anyways. Would've been better off without it. The acting and casting was ""decent"".",1495929600,,140,4.423076923076923
8497816,4,B006GVN1O4,"I don't normally enjoy improvised, unscripted movies. This is in fact the only unscripted movie I've ever liked. Unscripted movies seem to leave the actors floundering trying to find some plot to stand on. I'm pretty sure that the difference with this movie is Dylan O'Brien. From time to time the other actors flounder but he never does. I wouldn't be at all surprised if the cutting room floor was littered with scenes that didn't include him and if the final movie ended up being more about his character than the creators originally intended.",1491782400,,546,4.819148936170213

I loved this movie when I was watching on putlocker couple years ago.. This movie is so dang funny I laughed like a hynia or however you spell it.. But, anyways you have to watch this movie.. I'm about to purchase this DVD now that I know Amazon has it! Also, I'm a huge fan of Dylan O'Brien!!!",1464652800,,406,4.0875
