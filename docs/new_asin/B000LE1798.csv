2708002,5,B000LE1798,"Batman Beyond is a great spin-off of the Batman series. It was very stylistic and had hip techno music. I wish it would have continued a few more seasons, but alas, it lasted only three wonderful seasons. If you are like me, you must have bought all 3 Batman Beyond seasons, the Batman Animates series, Superman Animated series and all of the Justice League Animated series. These are wonderful collections fro all ages. I was initially disappointed when season 3 ended with no conclusions to the series. But if you have the Justice League Unlimited series one, it wraps up the Batman Beyond series nicely with ""Epilogue"" episode. We learn the shocking truth as to why Terry became the next Batman in project Batman Beyond, his love hate relationship with Bruce Wayne and finally, whatever did happen with him and Dana, his main squeeze. It is by far, my favorite Batman Beyond episode, and you'll see why when you see it. Too bad it wasn't included in this collection, but it's no biggie since I have all the animated series.",1175299200,5,1026,4.705555555555556
2708003,5,B000LE1798,-This is the final season and it is just as good if not better than the last two.  Excellent finale with some tie ins to later shows of the same genre.,1175040000,2,151,3.870967741935484
2708004,5,B000LE1798,"See Ras Al Gul's daughter Talia back for the first time since Superman/Batman adventures in 1998. I won't explain how.

Also see the first TV appearance of futuristic Justice League Unlimited, paving the way for their own show.

Batman Beyond is a terrific spin-off from the Batman series of the 1990s (much better than the series which it in turn spun off: Zeta Project."" (You will see Zeta back one more time in this season though).

Kevin Conroy is now voicing an elderly Bruce Wayne who continues to instruct and train his replacement Terry McGinnis.

The character development between old Bruce, Terry and former Batgirl Commissioner Barbara Gordon is excellent throughout all three seasons.

Since my local cable TV in Aust did not show season 3, I was particularly glad to see this released on DVD. I'd been waiting for years.

Snatch it up and indulge yourself,

Peter",1174521600,2,876,4.878378378378378
2708005,5,B000LE1798,"Since the team behind ""Batman: The Animated Series"" and ""Batman Beyond"" were concurrently starting work on ""Justice League Unlimited,"" I was afraid that the quality of the series would decline with this season.  But so far I've been pleasantly surprised; the interesting plots and character development continue.  Too bad this is the end.",1174348800,3,338,5.3584905660377355
2708006,5,B000LE1798,"The third, and last, season of Batman Beyond was a big step above the decline in quality that was found in the sub-par second season of the animated series, and thank God (or Paul Dini and Bruce Timm) for that.  As the third season begins, Terry McGinnis (voiced by Will Friedle) has his hands full as the Batman of the future as old villains Ink, Zeta, and the Royal Flush Gang return.  It gets better though, as Talia Al Ghul, the daughter of Ra's Al Ghul, returns and makes a stunning offer to the aging Bruce Wayne, with huge results and an even bigger twist.  This episode is worth picking this DVD collection up for alone as we get to see Bruce and Terry side by side fighting.  It gets better with the two-parter ""The Call"", as Terry gets the call of a lifetime from Superman (given a great new futuristic look) to join the Justice League in an effort to uncover a traitor, with even more shocking results!  Batman also takes on Big Time, a former friend from Terry's past, and then goes toe to toe with KOBRA.  Sadly though, the series comes to an end with these episodes, but there would be more Batman Beyond.  The Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (the director's cut that is) was an excellent film which saw the return of Batman's greatest enemy, and as a previous reviewer already mentioned, we would see an older Terry in the Justice League Unlimited episode ""Epilogue"" in which Terry learns a shocking secret about his real origins (and yes, it would have been oh so nice if that episode was included in this et, because that is the true end of the series).  That aside, the third season of Batman Beyond is a fantastic pick up for fans of the series or Batman in general, and if you've never seen ""Epilogue"", you should pick up the first season of Justice League Unlimited for that alone.",1167955200,59,1805,4.448484848484848
2708007,5,B000LE1798,"I missed the majority of this show when it first aired. So I have been waiting for the series to be released to DVD, and so far I have not been dissapointed. Batman Beyond was a great show!

But I am dissapointed that Warner Bros. is not including the Justice League Unlimited episode ""Epilogue"" which is seen by many as Batman Beyond's true finale. FOX did this with both of its X-Files spin-offs The Lone Gunmen, and Millennium in which an alternate finale was filmed within the X-files series and was included in the boxed sets.

Other than that oversight by Warner Bros. I'm excited to finally have all of Batman Beyond to add to my DVD collection!",1167868800,9,652,4.516949152542373
2708008,5,B000LE1798,"If you are a fan of these cartoons, and if you already own ""Batman Beyond: Season One"" and ""Batman Beyond: Season Two,"" then you really should not think twice about purchasing the final volume in the BATMAN BEYOND series because it concludes an excellent television show, and it has thirteen absolutely magnificent episodes. Here is the episode list, with a very small description of each episode, so not a lot of the plot will be ruined:

1) King's Ransom -- The Royal Flush Gang returns.
2) Untouchable -- Batman must face a new villain, The Repellar.
3) Inqueling -- Ink returns, and so does her daughter!
4) Big Time -- Big Time, a friend from Terry's past returns.
5) Out of the Past -- Talia Al Ghul, Ra's Al Ghul's daughter and Bruce Wayne's past love from ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" visits Bruce on his birthday.
6) Speak No Evil -- Batman helps a genically enhaced gorilla find his mother's killer.
7) The Call: Part I -- Superman asks Batman to join the Justice League Unlimited.
8) The Call: Part II -- Batman must comfront a traitor in the Justice League Unlimited!
9) Betrayal -- Big Time returns once again and causes problems for Batman.
10) The Curse of the Kobra: Part I -- KOBRA kidnaps Max Gibson, Terry's friend, and plans to release a bomb.
11) The Curse of the Kobra: Part II -- The second part of ""The Curse of the Kobra: Part I.""
12) Countdown -- Zeta, the robot from Season Two, returns to Gotham City to find his creator...but something goes wrong!
13) Unmasked -- A flashback of how Terry was once unmaked.

SPECIAL FEATURES might be another ""Panel"" and probably Commenteries and trailers.

I myself have not seen all of these episodes, but I can for sure tell you that they are great! I hope you buy this to add yet another excellent volume to your Timm/Dinin DVD collection!!! You will not regret it.  ^_^",1167436800,30,1838,4.5606060606060606

Intro: Batman Beyond: the Future of All of the Batvillains; A 'Free verse' Poem: an Article

by

Mark Walt Meredith

The creators of BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES had reached nearly as far as they could go with the waning popularity of the stories.

The popularity of the Batman characters in an animated series was reaching the end for that time and the creators needed to revamp the series to give it a few more seasons, and that came in loud and clear from the lowering ratings numbers.

Something bad just had to happen to, the Batman, Mr. Wayne, to give him obstacles, to make, Batman, a supporting character, and there needed to be someone to become the revamped Batman.

As in the comic book version of The Dark Knight Returns the writers on the show had agreed that Bruce Wayne having heart problems was a cool idea.

The creators decided that they should have, Wayne, get old and have the spin off series take place in the future.

The voice of Jack Napier/the Joker had left the series, the voice of Robin 2, the Boy Wonder had quit, as well as Harley Quinn's voice had quit the animated series.

The creators of the cartoons had designed a costume that was more like a second skin than a costume.

The costume seemingly had no boots, no gloves, and no gray tights.

The costume was black so that, Batman, couldn't be seen in dark alleys; yet the mask part covered the whole face.

The only opening for the new Batman's mouth was a small one that made his mask look like the mask itself had a mouth.

The mouth made the outfit look even more like the new BATMAN had ebony skin.

Some people in the past have thought that, Batman, was always a giant bat or some kind of demon.

That fact is probably because there are some times when, Batman moves so fast and stealthily with Ninjutsu that all others would see are the shadow-filled cape, cowl and ""those eyes"" with the white contact lenses in them.

Criminals don't get to see, Batman's, shadowy lower face nor do they see the shadowy gray costume.

The cape and cowl are shaped as if the capes bottom were a bat's wings.

Look at, Wayne's, cape and look at a bat's wings and the truth of this comparison is clear.

Since Batman Beyond has come along, Batman, has employed the use of claws on, Batman's, gloved fingers to scare criminals as well as a cape made of faux leather shaped to look biologically as if they were cut off of some giant bat...complete with fake wing bone shapes in the fake leather.

Batman isn't the kind of super hero to actually cut criminals with, Wayne's, clawed fingertips but the claws make the Batman more intimidating to super-criminals.

Meredith-2 Intro: BATMAN BEYOND: the Future of All of the Bat villains; an Ar . .

In the future of the animated series Mr. Napier has disappeared for some reason and no one brings up what happened to Mr. Napier but ""now"" there is a notorious gang that is based in, Wayne's, city of Gotham.

Citizens of Gotham have to contend with a gang that robs people on the streets dressed as clowns and wearing Hallow'een' costumes.

The name of the gang is: ""Jokerz.""_

_ The new BATMAN the animated series was deluged with letters wanting to know where Mr. Napier had gone to and to have Mr. Napier back.

There were so many letters avalanching the creators of Batman Beyond that Joker's return would have to be a direct to-video movie called Batman Beyond: the Return of the Joker!

The makers of Batman Beyond talked to the voice actor that used to play Mr. Napier in BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES who happened to be Mark Hamil.

The creators of the Batman series told Hamil about the flood of letters that came in and the creators of the spin-off called Batman Beyond practically begged Hamil to work with the creators once again one last time as a guest appearance in the makers of Batman Beyonds' movie and Hamil said, ""yes!""

The makers of Batman Beyond asked the voice of Harley Quinn the Harlequin to come back as a guest star also and she agreed as well.

In the beginning of the ""direct to DVD"" ""Jokerz"" are being led ""in the background"" by a ""Mr. Napier/Joker"" that wears all black and short, greased back green hair.

It is a revamped ""Mr. Napier"" of the future that knows everything about, Wayne,...somehow.

It turns out that by the future ... Mr. Napier had been killed by being electrocuted by Timothy Drake Robin 2.

Mr. Napier had brainwashed Tim Drake into the evil ""Joker, Junior.""

During the final conflict at the destroyed Arkham Asylum ... Harley Quinn fell into a pit and supposedly died even though, Batman could never find the body of ""Harley Quinn.""

The Harlequin as a super villain had never been seen again.

In the end of the original Mr. Napier's last battle ""Joker, Junior"" finally turned on Mr. Napier as Tim Drake began laughing and crying, with two electric cables electrocuted Mr. Napier.

After that battle Tim Drake quit being Robin Boy Wonder, there was never a Robin Boy Wonder again.

Tim Drake blamed, Wayne, for the traumatic event and hadn't talked to, Batman, since that.

Batman had never tried to talk to Tim Drake after that..., Batman, blaming himself.

Tim Drake moved to another city and got a job fixing satellite dishes.

Batman never fixed things between, Batman, and Tim Drake.

Mr. Napier had put a tiny, metallic ""dot"" on Tim Drake with circuitry in it holding the ""sum total"" of Joker's personality that would change Tim Drake into ""Joker"" 2 in the future.

The Royal Flush Gang was in the cartoon named THE SUPER FRIENDS as a disguised man named only the King formed and gathered one-by-one a team called only Royal Flush Gang.

When King and after he created Royal Flush Gang...King revealed he was secretly ""Joker!""

Royal Flush Gang happened to be in BATMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES and, Batman, stopped Royal Flush Gang for a long time though eventually obviously they had reformed.

Royal Flush Gang had members like King, Ten, Ace and Jack.

By the ""future"" of Batman Beyond the leader of Royal Flush Gang was Jack who had by then become the King II.

Ace II was still the un-aging hulking android with all of the weaknesses of the Justice League of America: New Frontier built into Ace II's powers.

Ace II can change Ace II's surface to yellow for the Green Lantern and can use fire against, Batman, the Martian Manhunter.

The King II had hired a new bloodthirsty Jack II, the King III's new wife had become the Queen II and the King II's new daughter ""was become"" the new Ten.

Meredith-3 Intro: BATMAN BEYOND: the Future of All of the Batvil . .

Meredith-4 Intro: BATMAN BEYOND: the Future of All of the Bat . .

_ Mr. ""Freeze"" Victor Freis had gotten a disease in the past and had he frozen solid until humanity could find a cure for this disease.

By the time of the animated spin off Batman Beyond, mankind had found a cure and had unfrozen Freeze to cure Freeze.

Batman MacGuiness had shadowed him to see if he was on the ""straight-and narrow"" or not and the events turned out to be Freeze had turned over a new leaf.

 the future, there was an outbreak of designer drugs that had been outlawed by that point in time.

 The future had the abuse of a steroid that was used by, Batman's, old enemy to make ""Bane"" super-strong and more cunning.

The drug was called Venom and by that time, it had been synthesized into a patch form that could be absorbed into the skin.

Once the jocks in high school had slapped one of those Venom patches on their arms...the veins leading from the area of the patch would stand out immediately and the Venom abuser in general would become human looking hulks twice their size.

Batmanwent to find the source of the illegal patches.

Batmantraveled to the residence of ""Bane..."" ... and sneaked through the security guarding his mansion.

Batmangot through to ""Bane...""..., and then Mr. McGuiness saw that Bane was wearing an oxygen mask; unhealthily scrawny; lanky and sitting in a love seat, unresponsive.

When a Doctor saw young Batman...... ... Batman asked, ""What happened to him""?!

Meredith-5 Intro: BATMAN BEYOND: the Fu . .

The guard said, ""Too many years on Venom"".

_Mr. MacGuiness went out and found the real distributor of the patches who wasn't Bane, stopping the flow of the dangerous drug forever.

One of ""Jokerz'"" gang is a ""more modern"" version of Jonathan Crane the Scarecrow from the movie THE DARK KNIGHT and BATMAN BEGINS.

He wears a scarecrow Halloween' outfit and keeps weapons in a plastic Jack O lantern with a carrying handle that the Jack O lantern hangs from.

_Spellbinder from BATMAN IN DETECTIVE COMICS the comic book series shows up the time of Batman Beyond as well.

Instead of being a corny supercriminal from the 60's with an eye design on his mask forehead, a swirl insignia on Spellbinder's chest and a red costume ... Spellbinder in Batman Beyond has a full face mask with a red and black swirl design that continues down Spellbinder's skin tight bodysuit like an ""insane"" Spider-Man.

On his palm is an eye design that Spellbinder used to hypnotize people. . .

We are given some great episodes such as Out Of The Past, where Talia returns on Bruce's birthday to offer him immortality, The Call, where Superman asks Batman to join the Justice league, and Unmasked, where Terry tells Max a time he had to unmask to save a boys life. All episodes are packed with steller voice acting, from Will and Kevin, the soundtrack rocks and animation beautiful. The only reason I'm not to fond of this season is because it didn't really end. We see no development from Terry, he still makes bone head mistakes. We do see some maturity in the episode Countdown. It would be nice to see him changed and be smart like the original Batman. A nice ending would be an episode of him fighting alongside the Justice League. Does Terry just drop Dana? We never see what became of those two.

I think Timm Bruce tried to regain the greatness of season 1, and knew the 2nd season was a horrible down ward turn in stoy telling. So, the 3rd season, I think he tried to fix the damage. Less about Terry's teenaged troubles and back to better villians and stories. Not as good at the first season, but much better than the 2nd.

2708215,5,B000LE1798,"In the third and last season of Batman Beyond, we see Terry(aka the New Batman)becoming a Batman of his own with less help from Bruce. This itself affects alot of the plot lines and such in the episodes. The season kicks off with ""King's Ransom"" and the return of the Royal Flush Gang with Terry falling in love with one of its' members. Yet, the gang aren't the only villains to return. Inque, The Kobra Clan, Charlie Bigalow, you name it. Course, my favorite episode has to be ""The Call"" which shows Terry joining The Justice League. Sadly, this volume only contains 13 episodes and ends on a rather dull note with the episode, ""Unmasked"".

My gripe is the same as before with seasons on DVD, there's just not enough extras here to suit me. Bonuses here include: ""Inside Batman Beyond Season 3"" which is a ten minute long look at the producer's favorite moments and ideas they came up with but never got to film, such as an episode where Terry actually finally made a date with his girlfriend instead of missing out - a pretty formulaic element of the show. They also admit the show ended on a lower note then they might have liked. ""Closeup on..."" takes those producers and pairs them up with Will Friedle for brief discussions on a few of the thirteen episodes in the set. You'd be surprised at how much Friedle knows about the show and his character.

Personally, I thought Batman Beyond was a great but short-lived show. It's funny(for lack of a better term) how, once the show got its' legs to stand on, the 'powers that be' yank the plug on the show. I liked it because it was a darker take on Batman, per se'. I'll admit, it took me a little while to warm up to the show but, once I did, I loved it. It had very clever storylines, beautifully designed action sequences, and was animated in a more anime-style. What more could a fan ask for?

Another thing that saddens me about the show is that, during this time, a live-action movie was planned on the show. That really would have been something to see and maybe we could've seen a proper ending to Terry's story. Alas, it didn't happen.

I highly recommend this show to any Batman fan. Get all three seasons. It is a great show. It took me a little over 6 months to complete the series on DVD but it was well worth it!!!",1234224000,,2281,4.385342789598108

2708236,4,B000LE1798,"If you're considering a purchase of Season Three, I can assume you've seen the first two seasons. There isn't any big departure from the formula, which is a good thing. There was a little too much emphasis on mindless action for my taste this time around.

The first season episodes have better writing. I've watched those several times and they still hold up. I won't be replaying the third season as often.

I really don't think there is much character development. Dana is still given virtually nothing to do. The writers were cruel to her. Max is a great cast member, as always. But I don't remember the stories involving much of Terry's mother and brother, or much related to high school. The plots are mostly given over to the Batman side of Terry's double life. The other part of his life is less prominent.

Another reviewer mentioned no subtitles. I can't remember if the first two seasons had them. Nevertheless, their absence was annoying. How cheap can they be, not to subtitle the programs for the hearing-impaired? Bad form, Warner Brothers.

This is a fitting end to the series (though the final program was a bit lame). It doesn't quite live up to the joy I experienced watching the first two seasons, but Batman Beyond held up a level of quality I haven't found in any other animated program. It was a great team, a great theme, and well executed by the writers, actors, and animators. Buy it, watch it, love it.",1188864000,,1429,4.636363636363637
2708237,5,B000LE1798,"In the third (and unfortunately final) season of Batman Beyond, the show's creators settle into a rhythm that's really reminiscent of their finer moments in the much heralded Batman: The Animated Series.  Having followed the series from its debut episode right up until the final, I can state that the entire third season manages to feel very natural in terms of character interaction and setting mood.  While not as unpredictable as the first season, the third was wise to put Maxine Gibson (from season 2) on the backburner.  Terry is much more able to explore his own thoughts and feelings as the new Batman with Bruce to back him up when the going gets rough.  Note: Max is still present in many episodes, but her role is a bit more subtle.

Unlike Batman: The Animated Series, Batman Beyond doesn't run quite a tight rouge's gallery.  There are some reoccurring villains (such as Inque, Blight, The Jokerz, etc.) but nothing like the staples found in the original Batman story-lines.  The show's creators claim that while there never an official ""canceling"" of Batman Beyond, they were all approached with assignments that caused them to drift apart which explains why the final episode could be viewed as fairly anticlimactic.  Fortunately, as a result, greats like Justice League and Unlimited would be born.  Batman Beyond is a program that still holds up beautifully and brings an interesting take on an already wonderful franchise. My only complaint about the series is that it had to come to an end.

The episode ""out of the past"" is my personal favorite. Bruce Wayne, now aged and bitter is given the chance to be young again by a former love but is everthing it seems? Of course not. The action is well balenced with plot and substance throught the season. The two part episode focused on Kobra is very good, with spectaular voice acting talent from Alexis Denishof. (interestingly many buffy the vampire slayer and angel cast members contribute their voices throught the Timmverse series, look out for them). The future justice league also make an appearence, complete with a superman whose kryptonian DNA has kept him relativly youthful over the forty years since the end of the modern DCAU, a nice touch by the creators i thought. The only gripe i have is that ""unmasked"" is not really a fitting ending to the series, working as a standalone episode. Fortunatly the final episode in season one of ""justice league unlimited"" ""epilouge"" ties up batman beyonds loose ends. i find the balance of darkness and humour refreshing all the way though the season and the homages to the original series are loving.
