8601901,5,B00E689HD8,"It's great to have this t.v. series cleaned up and in bluray quality. I missed this year's ago when it was out on DVD and started buying them for a decent price, but then they got extremely pricey. Thus is a great buy of a great series for those that love robot/mecha anime shows with  some good comedy.",1424563200,,303,4.224137931034483
