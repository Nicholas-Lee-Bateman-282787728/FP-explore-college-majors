7741636,3,B01F2NCSJK,"I used to like series. However, IMO things went down quick. If you are a 4th grade teacher you do not jump out the window and you leave the kids unattended. Molly never liked Peggy and then they are writing to-gether? Why was Harry a character? He was a waste. I wish things stayed the same. Molly wasn't the center of attention.",1510185600,,329,4.32258064516129

7741643,5,B01F2NCSJK,"This is a great series! Even though it was highly rated it was cancelled when Melissa McCarthy lost a significant amount of weight. This would alter the basic premise of the show, ie two very overweight people finding love.",1498262400,3,223,4.743589743589744
7741644,5,B01F2NCSJK,Loved it!,1497225600,,9,4.0
7741645,5,B01F2NCSJK,"I had seen this flipping channels but never paid attention to it. Until I cut my cable and hooked up an antenna. I finally sat and watched a full episode and was hooked after a few episodes. So much that I started watching on a regular basis. When I saw they had released an entire series box set it was a no brainer for the price. Picked it up for $35 which is a steal for 6 complete seasons.

I only wish CBS hadn't cancelled this show. The acting is great and the cast is fantastic. I received the box set yesterday, and already I'm 10-12 episodes into it. Though I've seen most of the episodes 2 or 3 times they are still funny and worth rewatching. I highly recommend this for both the value and quality...",1494028800,3,711,4.189781021897811

8759977,5,B01F2NCSJK,"I don't even know where to start but here it goes (no spoilers): There are a bunch of shows that shows you kinda real couple trying to figure out their lives together but this one takes the cake... Its way beyond hilarious and cute at the same time, it also shows some stuff some everyday situations that couples faces.

I have no idea how the cast made it without laughing at certain lines or situations that it becomes humanly impossible not to laugh at, they are amazing! i mean, how do they hold their attempt of laughing? if i try to hold it in front of my niece sometimes i surely have 911 dialed and my finger ready to push the call button in case of a heart attack hahahaha...

I truly appreciate, love and cherish this show, its a good and worthy bing-watching one. You will not regret this purchase at all. Buy it, watch it, enjoy it, but no cellphones! Its very contextual and you need full attention to it.

Take it from me, put your cellphone away if you're off-duty, you will not regret it.",1536624000,,1004,4.329787234042553
