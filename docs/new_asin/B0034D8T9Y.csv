4066809,3,B0034D8T9Y,"Fox Screen Archives must be trying to improve as this is a very good color print. The unusual western centers around the Corbett-Fitzsimmons fight in Carson City. But it still has the good guys/bad guys with a ridiculous shoot-out at the end. No one is a particular good shot. Dale Robertson is his usual wooden self and Jeanne Crain tries to bring a little life into her scenes, but she is pretty.",1394668800,6,398,4.541666666666667
4066810,3,B0034D8T9Y,"In Carson City, Nevada during a world championship prize fight between Bob Fitzsimmons (Gil Perkins) and ""Gentleman Jim"" Corbett (John Daheim), a gang rides into town with the intention of robbing the proceeds of the fight. Unfortunately, their leader (Dale Robertson) finds that two other rival gangs have the same idea. Directed by Harmon Jones (GORILLA AT LARGE), the film's plot sounds interesting enough to expect an intriguing western and while it holds our attention, the execution is limp though the actual robbery during the fight is handled very well. As usual, Richard Boone makes for a compelling villain but the film's subplot featuring the usual good girl and bad girl vying for the hero slows the action down. Jeanne Crain as the good girl looks ravishing in Technicolor but despite being top billed, there's isn't anything for her to do but fret. Carole Mathews (SWAMP WOMEN) as the bad girl fares somewhat better. With the exception of a rousing main title, Cyril J. Mockridge's score is forgettable. With Lloyd Bridges, Carl Betz, James Best, Leo Gordon, Rodolfo Acosta, Don Haggerty and John Doucette.

The Fox DVD from Spain is a nice Technicolor transfer in its appropriate 1.33 aspect ratio.",1314835200,7,1213,5.065

8388353,4,B0034D8T9Y,"One of Dale Robertsons best. Paired up again with Jeanne Craine (Take Care of my litle girl) and a younge Lloyd Bridges and Richard Boone. Storyline is fairly involved and one has to concentrate to follow the three gangs involved. Dale is the Tall, handsome, brooding, scheming, romantic and a western star who can really ride a horse. Could watch this movie over and over.",1401148800,9,373,4.753846153846154
