8416469,1,B0025ZIG68,Very poor quality VHS transfer - not remastered at all.  Pixelated and spanish sub-titles over the text.  This is the SILENT FILM Version!  It does not say that in the description.,1294617600,,180,4.741935483870968
8416470,1,B0025ZIG68,"This was just a version made off of a VHS tape, very pixelated, not remastered.  Not only wasn't it ""remastered"" it had Spanish subtitles over the silent movie's 'English title cards'.  That would be fine if it was what I wanted ... NOT.  Very distracting.  Their description could have been more detailed.",1249430400,7,306,4.826923076923077
