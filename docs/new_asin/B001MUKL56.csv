8321824,5,B001MUKL56,I'm just learning this stuff. Buck Brannaman is a good teacher of people as well as horses.,1527465600,,91,4.411764705882353
8321825,5,B001MUKL56,Mr. Brannaman is a wealth of information. I watch and re-watch his training DVD's and always am inspired to try harder to be the best horseman I can be.,1428192000,3,152,4.275862068965517
8321826,5,B001MUKL56,"this is a video that you'll need to watch and try and watch again.......and each time watch more closely for the subtle hints and clues

the only thing is i wish they had a complete session no breaks.....with one critter....and rider....and then again.

as a newbie wrangler and longtime horse owner......i just did a 3 day Wilde to broke client.....and then watch these and buck is a master.....i see the light...the clues....but for a newbie....it is overload......so be patient and keep trying......if not you'll have a best friend......and learned so much.......so don't expect a miracle on your first try....like but says practice practise.....and it will come ....its really about communication both ways and this gentle-ING and not breaking a horse",1410048000,2,755,5.283333333333333
8321827,5,B001MUKL56,"Getting the fundamentals & and an understanding is basic before launching into training. Buck is a master in teaching & training horses, so why go elsewhere?  He takes you through the steps & if you're not getting it, start over & be sure to watch what he's talking about when a horse responds the way he wants it to.  THAT's what you want in your horse.  Sometimes the response is small, but catching it is important to giving the horse a reward for stepping out into obedience.",1402876800,5,479,4.482758620689655
8321828,4,B001MUKL56,"Overall this is a great set to have if you like Buck and his teaching.  I gave it 4 stars instead of five as it featured a lot of roping from horseback, which, while very worthwhile to the horses in the video will not be what I am doing with my horse.  I do not possess the skills to rope a horse I am working with from another horse.  However, watching Buck work in this way gives me a greater understanding of how that is done.  I do plan on having a professional, knowledgeable trainer rope my horse in that manner, so I find it valuable in that regard.  I just wish there was more groundwork where the person is on the ground too.

Overall- this is a great video to add to your Buck collection.",1395446400,5,698,4.095588235294118

8321830,5,B001MUKL56,Just fantastic and easy to follow with so many helpful ideas.  I am a newbie in owning my own horse and this was priceless for me!,1384819200,5,130,4.0
