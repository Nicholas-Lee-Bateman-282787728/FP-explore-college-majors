8040164,5,B00068GH9E,"Hours of interesting and historical information await you in this fascinating film. This movie is amazing. The countries covered and their history with the birds is so much more than what you could ever find in a book. I will constantly be impressed by Mr. Jenner's intuition, storytelling ability, and artistic eye.",1299628800,,316,5.096153846153846

As a life-long pigeon fancier I must say that this five hour series is the most complete, most professional work I have ever seen on pigeons.  The twenty chapters are exceptionally well told and the photography is wonderful.  It makes me proud to be a pigeon fancier to see what a fine story is told here about the many, many facets of the pigeon hobby, including Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth's racing lofts, that are included here.  This epic work is a must for any pigeon fancier but will also make a wonderful educational piece for schools & libraries.",1132272000,5,575,4.72
8040166,5,B00068GH9E,"As past President of the American Racing Pigeon Union, I am very pleased to say that this is the very best DVD & Video on pigeons in the world. I have seen them all.  Not only is it educational, but also very entertaining.  A real opportunity to learn about pigeon raising in mainland China also.  I highly recommend this video and all the other pigeon videos that Mr. Jenner has produced.  This is a must in any pigeon fancier's library.  Children will find it fascinating and to discover a family hobby that all ages can enjoy.",1100995200,13,529,4.46875
