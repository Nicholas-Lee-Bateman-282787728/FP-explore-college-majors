1964779,5,B00011D1NQ,"No one in modern American history stirs as much controversy and disagreement as does General Douglas MacArthur. In this terrific documentary which PBS originally presented as part of the ""American Experience"" series, narrated by noted historian and author David McCollough (""Truman"") in an exhaustive four hour excursion into the remarkable, incredibly flamboyant and star-crossed life of Douglas MacArthur, a endlessly complex, brilliant, but vainglorious general so many Americans learned to either love or hate.
It is all here, from his ignominious (although officially ordered) personal withdrawal from the Philippines by PT boat, leaving his entrapped garrison behind to the rebuilding of American presence in the south pacific, and the first tentative efforts to stem the tide of Japanese aggression in New Guinea. MacArthur was a virtual dynamo, and was instrumental in slowly but methodically turning the tide against the Japanese, first by leap-frogging his way slowly up the coast of New Guinea, and then by island hopping his way closer to a return to the Philippines. By late 1944 he was ready to invade the Philippines, and did so boldly and with a smashing success first in Leyte, and then eventually retook all of the islands. Finally, he oversaw the signing of the instruments of surrender in Tokyo Bay, and the terrific footage of the actual signing of the peace accords is by itself worth the price of the video.
The documentary is full of informative details concerning MacArthur's life, from his obsession with equaling or surpassing his Medal Of Honor winning father's career as a late 19th century Army general to his fear and difficult relationship with his adoring but domineering mother, who actually cohabited with him as late as when he was Commandant of West Point in his mid-forties after World War One. We learn a great deal about the career thrust of ""Dugout Doug"" in this fascinating personal portrait of him which depicts him as vain, a publicity hound, and a wry but sometimes nave politician and darling of the Republican right wing, who protected him from suffering the court martial and disgrace of the commanding general and admiral at Pearl Harbor.
The historic and constitutionally charged clashes between President Harry Truman and MacArthur over the strategy in Korea are carefully examined, leaving this viewer both admiring MacArthur's position based on his knowledge of the combat situation as well as his resolve not to appease the Chinese, but yet also understanding that too much was at stake politically and strategically to be as aggressive and as provocative as MacArthur tended to be. This documentary provides the viewer with four hours of edifying detail concerning one of history's most instrumental and successful military leaders during his times at destiny's door. I really enjoyed this video, and suspect you will, too.",971395200,25,2878,5.231601731601732
1964780,5,B00011D1NQ,"This is one of the best biography's I ever viewed on video.  Not only did it hold my interest from beginning to end, it was very educational and revealing.  This work was well researched and well written.  It presents an  in-depth look at a man who had a significant influence on our nation's  history.  But it does not stop there.  It also gives an in-depth look at  ourselves, and our own history as a people.  It helps us to reflect upon  our moods and attitudes during World War II an the Korean war.  It puts in  perspective the history of America's relationships with The Philipines,  Japan and China.  Most revealing are the power struggles that take place  behind the scenes at the highest levels of government.  It puts a human  face on superstardom.  If you want to learn how Japan got to where it is  today after loosing World War II, why we dropped the atom bomb, and why our  relationship with China is what it is today, this video will help.  General  Douglas McArthur not only had a major influence on the history of his time,  but because of his policies and actions, he is still a major influence on  our history today, and will be for a very long time.",958262400,28,1170,4.410377358490566

8005047,5,B00011D1NQ,"The PBS program ""MacArthur"" was a well done documentary of this controversial figure in American history. I found it largely factual and in general agreement with other presentations about this man. I did find the program a bit ""pro MacArthur"" but not so much as to make it to be without value. All in all it is informative and enjoyable to watch.",1416787200,,347,4.612903225806452
8005048,5,B00011D1NQ,"Weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese were threatening Australia and New
Guinea. Winston Churchill and Army Chief of Staff George Marshall urged President
Roosevelt to order MacArthur to Australia to organize its defenses. MacArthur saw
opportunities where other men saw problems. But Australian defenses hardly existed.
Planes were either being assembled or repaired and there was no navy. Washington
promised planes and troops, but couldn't deliver right away. Roosevelt's priority
was the war against Hitler.
A detailed bio of MacArthur that should please all.

8005049,5,B00011D1NQ,"I thought this was a very good documentary, that showed all of the ups and downs of General MacArthur's career. I got the impression that MacArthur was really full of himself and I was amazed when it was mentioned that General MacArthur came very close to getting court martialled due to his actions in the Phillipines from Dec 1941 to the Fall of the Phillipines. Apparently in the 1930's he was offered the rank of Field Marshall in the Phillipine Army and he actually thought about taking it, due to his ego!! Most people also aren't aware that Eisenhower was MacArthur's aide in the Phillipines in the 1930's and Eisenhower was belittled by MacArthur, who called him the ""the Best Clerk in the whole US Army"". I would also be interested to hear what happened to MacArthur's son who shunned a miltary career, in favor of the theatre??",1329177600,,837,4.662162162162162
8005050,5,B00011D1NQ,MacArthur was a polarizing personality for sure.  He is one of my heroes and this video provides excellent footage and a great memory of The General.  I taught mathematics at the USAF Academy so I am a bit biased toward this West Point graduate.,1301097600,,245,4.545454545454546
8005051,5,B00011D1NQ,"Excellent for first timers.  Brief in its depth, but supportive to those interested in the research.  Very good source information provided; worth the price.",1248912000,,157,5.5
8005052,5,B00011D1NQ,"Was Gen. MacArthur an egomaniac? Yes, name me a general who wasn't. But in America's 'brief' history, you will not find a more intelligent, and courageous officer than this man. During WWI, his personal bravery and daring led to seven Silver Stars. During WWII, he lost less men in the southwest Pacific in four years of fighting, than Gen. Eisenhower did at the Battle of the Bulge alone! During the Korean war, at seventy years of age, his offensive at Inchon was the height of audacity and planning. He wrote Japan's postwar constitution, he is also revered by many Japanese to this day.
All in all, his career is enough to make one say, ""Patton who?""",1153785600,5,654,4.646551724137931
8005053,5,B00011D1NQ,"Was General MacArthur an ""egomaniac,"" as others reviewers have noted? Of course he was, but few Americans in history had better cause to have such an high opinion of themselves. Not only was MacArthur astonishingly brilliant (he graduated first in his West Point class), he was handsome, erudite, reached the apex of his profession with his fifth star, and he a military genius. It would be difficult to be humble having such an array of stunning attributes. Few have possessed such an astonishingly rich rsum.
American Experience biographies are always exemplary efforts and this is no exception. We see footage of various places MacArthur knew, from the military forts of his childhood, West Point, Manila, all the way to his last days at his improbable residence, the Waldorf Astoria. There are a multitude of interviews with people in MacArthur's orbit, from his military aide in the Philippines do his aide in Korea. The historians they include are all interesting, with the exception of the pompous Geoffrey Perret, who wrote a disappointing and error-laden biography of MacArthur.
There is an abundance of material on MacArthur's private life, including his bizarre first marriage to a flapper and his stable second marriage to his devoted Jean. MacArthur's Eurasian mistress is not forgotten either, and the documentary quotes from his sappy, Victorian love letters to her. Very interesting stuff! Finally, they include the fact that his only son, Arthur MacArthur, changed his name and now lives anonymously in NYC as a saxophone player. This is a highly entertaining documentary, beautifully produced, edited and scripted. It doesn't get much better than this.",1059782400,8,1670,5.258426966292135
