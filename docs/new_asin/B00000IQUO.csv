1230067,4,B00000IQUO,"I watched this for Drew and she did not disappoint.
This was a very interesting role for her to agree to do...she was quite impressive. Her accent and the way she carried herself was fantastic. I wish it could have gone into more detail...I thought the story was too vague. If I had any questions about what happened they wouldn't really have been answered here...there are too many conflicting stories...it doesn't make sense to me that Amy Fisher was the only person convicted of anything...maybe that's the point?
Drew can do no wrong in my book...I'd watch her paint a fence! If you're an admirer I'd like to suggest you buy this film...if you're not, I'd like to suggest you'd at least rent it. It's worth a peek.",1017964800,7,718,4.6171875
1230068,2,B00000IQUO,"I forced myself to sit through this movie when it aired on television the first time. Although the acting was decent, perhaps even good, it was based, unfortunately, primarily on the tabloids and inaccurate accounts in the newspapers/television reports. How do I know this? Simple. I grew up in Bellmore, Long Island and went to school, and was friends with Amy (which, btw, is not the correct spelling of her name, just another instance of the press not bothering to check their facts).
I personally feel watching this video, or any movie based upon the unfortunate real life (no matter how inaccurate) events of unfortunate people is tacky at best, but if you're going to watch it, please don't take it as the gospel of what really happened.",1008633600,5,743,4.8125
1230069,5,B00000IQUO,GOOD PLOT EVEN FOR A TRUE STORY.  HEE! HEE! DREW AS USUAL WAS AWSOME SHE PLAYED THE ROLE BETTER THAN ANYONE COULD HAVE POSSIBLY DONE AND I ENJOYED EVERY MOMENT OF HER [DREW].  CASPER,1002067200,,182,4.323529411764706
1230070,5,B00000IQUO,"Drew was simply dazzling in the Amy Fisher story.  We all know
the
history of the event...young girl from Long Island shoots
her lover/.../car mechanic's wife in the head on her very own
front porch.  I've seen all the Amy Fisher movies and Drew blew all
the others away.  Her hair, her makeup, her clothes, her gawdy Long
Island accent are all perfect.  I don't know Amy Fisher personally, but
Drew made Amy lovable yet moody, innocent yet dangerous!  The
only complaint I have is the casting of Joey Buttafucco's character.
The actor was better looking and way too polished to be Joey, but
that's Hollywood for you.",980380800,7,617,4.675925925925926

7911552,4,B00000IQUO,"The Amy Fisher Story is a beautiful train wreck
the same night this movie aired another network aired ""There"" version of the Amy Fisher/Joey Buttafuoco scandal the other version having another former child star  in Alyssa Milano!
Both films were sleazy exploitation on network tv both films were also terrible between the long island accent and just the rush to get there's made and put out  during the massive media frenzy
The film is average but, it was also rushed (this was around the time network's got away with doing hatched jobs of real national media stories and got away with what they shown) Looking back I'm shocked no network tried to do a OJ Simpson made for tv movie! (maybe they did and i missed it) with everyone being so litigious this would never be made now
The film is the story of  the long island Lolita Amy Fisher meeting Mr. ""Stupid Pants"" Joey Buttafuoco there affair, and the infamous shooting of Joey's then wife Mary Jo
If this whole thing didn't really happen you'd swear it was something out of Hollywood
The facts are sketchy and there were a number of real victims
fast forward to 2005  Joey Buttafuoco leaks a sex tape then Amy Fisher does too (with a man she marries that looks and sounds like
Joey Buttafuoco) Amy kind of lives of to the stereotype of a girl having daddy issues!
She would later sign a adult contract and do 6-8 films and tour around strip clubs promoting the films!
You can't really blame her or call her a s! ut  hell Kim Kardashian only got massive exposure from her so-called leaked sex tape but, everyone forgets and acts like she's American Royalty!

In 2001 when Anchor Bay actually put out cools stuff they put out The Amy Fisher Story Uncut with all the sex scenes/nudity intact from the foreign cut  A+
One massive negative the film is full frame they put the work into a raunchy unedited version but, didn't think to present it in Widescreen
The foreign cut was infamous but, it's nothing shocking! at the time I'm sure it was cause i think this was Barrymore's first nude/sex scene
I could be wrong though.....
If you are a Drew Barrymore fan it's a must have in a sense It's Drew as a brunette looking stunning but, you might wanna punch out your tv from the horrid long island accent  No offense to any people from Long Island
It like so many of Anchor Bay's early dvd back catalog is no out of print and over priced
you could find this in strange places like Pawn Shops, Good Will, maybe a yard sale
It's a interesting buried treasure just for the time capsule angle and pop culture in general  8.5/10",1447891200,2,2569,4.483940042826553

7911554,3,B00000IQUO,"I remember this when I was in high school, as I too was about Amy Fisher's age and wondered how it was that this whole media frenzy exploded around this event.  Amy and Joey became late night talk show punchlines and launched a million jokes, and it was also hilarious that all three networks had made for TV movies about this.  You could flip from one channel to another and hear ""She's dead!' *click* ""She's dead!"" *click* ""She's dead!"".  Your enjoyment of the movie itself depends on how much time and interest you invested in the actual story.  Looking back, I'm not sure why it is that we bothered to look at this mess.  It was all so funny that a man in his forties who dressed in MC Hammer pants, gold chains and pattern boots was happily married with two children in Long Island and decided to take up with a 17 year old girl who was so obviously, as the press dubbed her, a Long Island Lolita.  And his wife, Mary Jo, who Amy would shoot on their front doorstep, sat by his side with her twisted face and defended him.  I think they were all so obnoxious that we couldn't help but laugh at them.

Amy Fisher was a self centered teenager who was going to high school on Long Island, experiencing all the friction that a teenager has with their parents, and had a certain reputation for dressing slutty and being just that.  One day, after a fender bender, she meets the dashing (ha ha ha) Joey Buttafucco at his body shop and she is suddenly smitten.  The two begin an affair, despite his being twice her age and married.  Eventually Joey decides that Amy needs to work as a hooker, saying ""make love with your body and not your mind.""  What that means, I'm not sure.  Then or now.  Maybe he was looking for some kind of power trip.  Eventually in a jealous rage, Amy confronts his wife Mary Jo on the front porch of their house and shoots her in the head.  Mary Jo survived, Joey denied it all, and a media furry began.  How do I feel about this even today?  I'm not sure except it was a trashy train wreck to watch on television.  Today Joey and Mary Jo are divorced, Joey is limping along in the occasional public appearance and Amy is ""working"" in adult films.  They made a living out of their reputations.

The most positive thing one can say about this is that this help relaunch fallen child star Drew Barrymore back into the limelight.  She cultivated a Lolita type of role when she made a comeback as an adult, and it worked for her.  Today she enjoys success and a prosperous production company, Flower FIlms.",1424995200,,2527,4.364025695931478

she had the accent down,I went to school with and hung out with these chicks. She was academy worthy.",1186185600,,261,4.822222222222222
7911559,3,B00000IQUO,"How much you enjoy this movie will depend upon how much interest you have in Amy Fisher's story.  Absent the fact that it is based upon real events, it is not all that exciting.  It is well acted and filmed and makes some interesting comments upon the media, but that's all. From the perspective of realism and professionality, it is the best film made about Amy Fisher, but as a result is far less amusing than the other two films made from the perspective of Amy and Joey.  It is more difficult to find humour in the characters when they are more real.  This film, vs. the other two, shows equal sympathy (and condemnation) towards all those involved.  Thus, as an exploitation film, it is not that great.  The liner notes in the booklet about what Fisher and co. are doing now is far more entertaining and bizarre than anything in the film.  Regarding the few new minutes added, I can see why they would be edited out of TV broadcasts, but they barely rate anything more than a PG-13.
Watching this film did not leave me wanting to regain lost time, but it's not particularly memorable and I can't picture myself watching it a second time.",1038355200,7,1142,4.48792270531401
