1905267,4,B0000ADXFQ,"A great action flick with the gorgeous Heather Thomas at her sexiest. Unfortunately, mediocre picture quality, a shameless transfer to DVD with no digital enhancing. Still worth getting, however.",1269734400,3,195,5.758620689655173

1905269,1,B0000ADXFQ,"This is without a doubt the absolute worst movie I have ever had the misfortune to buy. When they cut that beloved little dogs throat and drained the blood, I wanted to throw up. That was when I ripped it out of the dvd player and put the movie where it belonged. The garbage can.",1237075200,,280,4.109090909090909
1905270,4,B0000ADXFQ,"This is one of my favorite 80s movies.  I used to watch The Fall Guy and I was surprised when I saw Heather Thomas was in this.  She plays both tough and sweet in this movie.  She also has a funny side.  If you are a big Heather Thomas fan and a fan of 80s movies, this one is for you.",1216684800,5,285,3.622950819672131
1905271,4,B0000ADXFQ,"It's campy, over acted, and low budget, everything a good B movie is supposed to be!!! And the cherry on top is Heather Thomas! What else could you ask for? If you like B movies I think you will really enjoy this one. On a side note, this was the last movie Dar Robinson made. You should get it for this reason alone. BTW, if you don't know who Dar Robinson is ... do yourself a favor and find out.",1184976000,6,398,3.9875
1905272,4,B0000ADXFQ,"This review is to discuss the DVD quality. If you're looking to have the sexy Heather Thomas in full screen beautiful color and a sharp well defined picture then you will be grossly disappointed with this joke for a DVD. The movie itself is a very entertaining little flick. With plenty of great shots of Heather in the typical 80's outfits. But the overall quality of the transfer to DVD was made from and old VHS tape that someone had laying around. Complete with your typical distorted waving pattern throughout the entire movie. Usually caused by not have the proper cables connected right. The colors are muddy and the picture is soft also typical of VHS movies. Very sad since I had hoped on having Heather at her physical peak in pristine DVD form. Unfortuantely, this studio needs the money badly and is only hoping that other Heather fans will purchase this sad representation of a mastered DVD. The movie was well worth better treatment.",1179705600,23,947,4.745454545454545

7996848,1,B0000ADXFQ,"Heather Thomas, Lee Majors' comely co-star of ""The Fall Guy,"" stars in the stealth cinematic offering (I don't remember seeing it advertised anywhere, for the record)--and in all likelihood wasn't--where she is the custodian of a motorcycle Evel Kneivel would have given his soul to own. Fred Olen Ray's recent direct-to-video actioner has a clearinghouse of Hollywood has-beens including Martin Landau, Troy Donahue, an uncredited Russ Tamblyn, and (gasp) President Reagan's son, Michael.
  Before I forget, the title is Cyclone, a laughable and ridiculous excuse for a movie. Thomas is the girlfriend of an inventor  (Jeffrey Combs of the Stuart Gordon-directed releases Re-Animator and From Beyond). In movies, only someone as nerdy-looking as Combs could get a girlfriend who looks like Thomas--but then again there is Dan Aykroyd and Donna Dixon--but then again, no one would have interest in devising a scenario where a pair of completely undynamic people are in a relationship.
  All Thomas seems to do is spend much of the film either tooling around on her motorcycle or hanging out at the gym with her well-toned pal (Ashley Ferrare of Revenge of the Ninja). Thomas takes Combs out to a nightclub to celebrate his birthday where he is murdered while dancing with her to the unmelodic and ridiculous songs played by a motley crew of a band called Haunted Garage.
  Heather finds that her late lover has been laboring on an invention which is sought by those responsible for his murder. The invention is a fancy motorcycle called ""cyclone"" and it features an array which Combs explains to her via a videorecording. The device looks like an advanced model of the lethal wheels used by Lucianna Paluzzi in Thunderball (1965), which probably explains why Martine Beswicke, one of Sean Connery's co-stars in his fourth 007 outing, is among the cast.
  One can only hope that Martin Landau was compensated for his time as he has been appearing in embarassments for a paycheck for quite a few years now. Perhaps for him to find other work might require the Impossible Missions Force to reassemble.. Clearly his role is an homage of sorts to cinematic villains of yesteryear. Possibly James Mason on North by Northwest (1959) perhaps? That might be stretching things but Landau did play one of Mason's goons in that noted Hitchcock work.
  Cyclone is little more than a vehicle for Thomas. It succeeds as ample testimony to her being a bad actress. She doesn't have to work so hard to be so lousy. On the positive side, she is a sight to behold and wears her figure-hugging attire well. In all likelihood, the cast probably furnished their own clothing. Sadly the film features some of the final work by veteran stuntman Dar Robinson who met his demise on the recent release Million Dollar Mystery. Even more sad, though it pains me to speak ill of the dead, his work here as an actor is nothing impressive.",1472428800,,2907,4.912244897959184
