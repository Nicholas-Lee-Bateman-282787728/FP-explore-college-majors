To me, there is no greater spectacle of artistic expression than a beautiful woman playing the violin and doing it superbly. Here the divine Ms. Mutter is far from dead, though she does appear rather cherubic in appearance (appropriate to the material?) in this all Bach concert with Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic. In contrast to the overt sexiness of the Beethoven violin concerto with the same forces (a characteristic commented on by at least one other Amazon reviewer), she here appears to be innocence itself.  I realize all of this is terribly subjective, and tastes will vary, but this""big band"" production of Karajan's has actually made me like Bach--something no period performance has managed to accomplish.  Do we really believe most of the great composers were satisfied with contemporary orchestras' abilities to incarnate their
creative fulminations? I think in many cases they were not satisfied, which points to the central fallacy of the period instrument movement--that the score adhered to literally and played by old instruments perfectly embodies the artistic vision of the composer. I have a video of Karl Bohm rehearsing ""Don Juan"" with the Vienna Philharmonic, where he tells them that Strauss (whom he knew personally) had forgotten to insert a marking in the score to the ""annoyance of his publisher"" (subtitle translation of Bohm's German remark).  So much then for the
""inviolability of the score"" argument, which is simply the old Toscanini dictum updated for the period instrument generation, which ultimately is about as reliable as nineteenth-century scientific positivism.

Anne-Sophie Mutter's performance of the concerto is satisfying and the Magnificat  which accompanies it is, for lack of a better word, magnificent. Anyone who tastes are not completely skewed by period instrument bias stands a good chance of enjoying these performance. I happen to like some period instrument performances as well as Karajan's renderings of some of the classics. After all, his idol was Toscanini. If we are going to discount Karajan, we have to do the same to Toscanini and everyone else who preceded the Norringtons and John Eliot Gardiners of the world. I admire the latter, but also admire Karajan's ability to elucidate the composer's meaning beyond the printed notes. Karajan studied the scores religiously and actually memorized many of them, which accounts for his conducting with his eyes closed in much of his career--to facilitate recall.

The picture quality on this DVD is actually better than I expected. My copy is region B. It will only play on an all-region player or a region B player. If you have an blu ray player which can play any region of blu ray or DVD, this DVD will look even better when it is played with the setting on region B blu ray. I found the sound to be quite acceptable: PCM stereo is offered, as well as 5.1 surround sound (generated through a re-recording of the tapes at the original venue). I prefer the PCM.

For those who cannot abide anything but period instruments, I feel sorry for you, just as I feel sorry for those who will not watch old black and white movies because they are not in color. And in some ways. the period instrument movement strikes me as the sonic equivalent of the garish colorization of black and white movies--a vain attempt to recreate something that really cannot be recreated at best and, at worst, no more than a soothing sop to the egos of the perpetrators. In any event, as a college music professor once asked me when I was mired in listening only to 19th century romantic music, ""Why limit yourself to one thing?""  Why indeed.",1473465600,,3745,4.952229299363057
