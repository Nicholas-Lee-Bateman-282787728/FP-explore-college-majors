This is not just for videographers it is for photographers as well.

If you consider yourself a professional I guarantee that you will learn at least a dozen tricks after watching videos.
You will be able to expand your artistic ability drastically.

If you are a average Joe with a video camera just recording for home videos you need this. You don't neet a nice camera to make good home videos you first need to learn how to really use a camera. Even if you just have a cellphone video camera this will benefit you.

I always thought I was a good videographer.
I made decent videos and short clips.
I would be lucky to have a video that garnered the attention of the viewer just by using the camera work.
After this series I laughed at what I made before.

This video will make you an AMAZING cameraman or woman.
I watched the videos years ago and took notes and everything as if it was a class.
College classes couldn't really teach me anything compared to what John teaches here.
I had friend who went to trade schools and college and didn't learn half of what is in these videos.

If you are considering going into media production of this nature this will be the BEST investment you make.
A better investment than a new camera a new lighting system or even new computer.

This videos are work drastically more than what they are sold for. Buy these video and I promise you will not be disappointed.",1333929600,,1482,4.410256410256411

I would pay 3 times of the price and still think of what good deal I have caught.

Great work, great narration, great attitude. The camera tricks and techniques are really simple to acquire and very neat!

If you are looking to improve your footage, make it pop up, be more 3D, more alive, catching eye it is the best short cut i have ever found. Even if I learned some of these techniques before and even used them more than once this refreshing, revitalizing outlook is very in place.

No matter have you been shooting for last 15 years as I do or just have purchase the camera and contemplate the your hobby, you will learn A LOT. Great work, here are the guys to learn from.",1142985600,5,941,4.269662921348314
