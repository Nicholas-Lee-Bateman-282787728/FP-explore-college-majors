2317577,5,B0009S4IJM,"On September 18, 2005, we commemorate the 100th birthday of one of the best actresses of any generation, Ms. Greta Garbo.  What better way to celebrate her life than by enjoying some of her excellent work.

""Ninotchka"", ""Queen Christina"", ""Anna Karenina"", ""Mata Hari"", ""Anna Christie"", ""Grand Hotel"", ""Camille"" and the silents, ""Flesh and the Devil"", ""The Temptress"" and ""The Mysterious Lady"" plus an excellent TCM documentary and hours of extras/commentaries/trailers will keep this most die hard of fans glued to television and DVD player.  I consider it the finest film festival I will have attended this season.",1126483200,11,615,5.319587628865979
2317578,5,B0009S4IJM,"I cannot believe that the greatest Garbo films (including the silents) came out in DVD. This box is my greatest treasure, because Greta Garbo is the best of the best. A perfect actress, beautiful and with a great talent. In terms of talent, Garbo is among Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Vivien Leigh, Katherine Hepburn. But in terms of beauty, Garbo is above them all!

If you are a Garbo fan (or a fan of great pictures), do yourself a favor and buy this imediately!",1126396800,10,464,4.523809523809524
2317579,5,B0009S4IJM,"I suppose the following remarks will make more sense to someone who's seen a number of Garbo films and responded to their particular magic.  No matter how tiresome the workings of the various plots, or the sometimes ridiculous headgear, couture, coiffure, costars, mise en scene - all of this in the end counts for nothing as she cannot be defined or contained either by her moment in time or her physical surroundings.  When you see her and hear her ""up there,"" on the screen, you are in the presence of a very, very, Old Soul neither feminine or masculine but a conglomeration of elements unique unto itself.  This truth is evident from that first glimpse in ""Gosta Berling"" right through the wreck and ruin of ""Two Faced Woman."" How courageous of her to allow us a look inside!

A wise old professor of mine once said that you cannot consider your education complete until you've seen what Greta Garbo does.  Thats why even the weakest of her films (The Torrent?  Susan Lennox? Romance?) are worth watching, and ""coffee table"" books are still being published (2 more this month) professing to answer why she remains an object of fascination and study.  Could it be this ultimate symbol of that most superficial of epitaphs  ""movie star"" went far beyond the expected and actually evoked something timeless and outside the traditional scope of the medium in which she practiced?

Watch these films and discover - either for the first time, or all over again.  If they themselves are not worthy of repeated scrutiny, she certainly is.  Garbo is soon to be 100, but I think her age is best measured in millenia.

2317580,5,B0009S4IJM,"Released in time for Garbo's hundredth birthday on September 18th 2005, this collection incorporates all the better films that GG made during her Hollywood career which was spent entirely at MGM. The three silent films are marvellous with astounding new prints and orchestral scores. Similarly the quality of the seven talkies are near flawless.
Must suggest if you are considering buying this collection that you also read Mark Viera's recent release book 'Greta Garbo - A Cinematic Legacy' to accompany it. Each chapter is an even-handed critical study and appreciation of each of her Hollywood films, ideally read prior to watching the movies in the set to gain a deeper appreciation.
It has long been considered by vintage cinema buffs that Greta was 'above' the quality of the films she was cast in, Mr. Viera's book attempts to rein in that myth, take a step back and objectively assess each of her films on their own merit.
The extras included in the DVD set are priceless, with particular reference to the screen test Garbo made for the unmade 1948 film 'La Duchesse de Langais', seven years after the final film she would ultimately appear in and also the alternate German language version of 'Anna Christie'.
No fan of vintage Hollywood or Greta Garbo should be without this one.",1117065600,15,1289,4.91743119266055

2317591,5,B0009S4IJM,"Greta Garbo is the portrait of the reclusive movie goddess shunning the media frenzy that fueled the public's interest in her. She is undoubtedly one of the brightest stars of the Golden Age, and definitely one of the most beautiful. The Divine Garbo, as her fans have nicknamed her, is showcased to her fullest in the Signature Collection, containing seven of her talkies, three of her silents, and a feature-length documentary.

''The Garbo Silents Collection'' is a two-disc collection containing three of her more popular silent features: The Temptress (1926/B&W/106 mins.), Flesh and the Devil (1926/B&W/112 mins.), and The Mysterious Lady (1928/B&W/89 mins.). Garbo came to Hollywood in 1925 with director Mauritz Stiller. She couldn't speak English very well and she was petrified about working at such a large place as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). These films capture Garbo at the early stages of her career, and co-star Antonio Moreno, John Gilbert, and Conrad Nagel, respectively.

The other seven movies are all sound movies, or talkies as they were called in the 1930s. All descriptions are taken (if not directly) from the DVD covers themselves.

Anna Christie (1930/B&W/89 mins.): The publicity slogan read ''Garbo Talks!'' Like Lon Chaney and Charlie Chaplin, Garbo had continued to make silents even though talkies were all the rage. Sixteen minutes or so into this movie, Garbo appears at the doorway of a bar, and after taking her seat, she utters her first piece of dialogue: ''Gimme a whiskey, ginger ale on the side, and don't be stingy baby!'' Her husky voice added to her other-worldly allure. As Anna, she plays a former prostitute whose past choices may in fact ruin her chances at a happy future. As a bonus, the German-language version of the movie Garbo did with a different cast and director is included. Co-starring Charles Bickford and Marie Dressler. Directed by Clarence Brown.

Mata Hari (1931/B&W/89 mins.): Who better to play the WWI spy than Garbo, the divine star called the Swedish Sphinx? To answer, no one could have done it better. With the world at war, Mata Hari's heart (something she didn't know she possessed) is stolen by a handsome aviator. Love is her weapon, and the only men she couldn't seduce were the twelve in the firing squad that brought her turbulent life to a tragic end. Co-starring Ramon Navarro, Lionel Barrymore, and Lewis Stone.

Grand Hotel (1932/B&W/112 mins.): ''People come. People go. Nothing ever happens.'' This line offered a bit of irony to the movie's plot: yes people came and went, but something is always happening. Garbo (who gets top billing) plays a famous Russian dancer whose career is hitting the rocks. In a moment of depression, she utters the famous line ''I want to be alone.'' This was the first so-called ''all-star'' movie. Its rather long and slow-moving, but no one can deny this movie's grandness. Co-starring John and Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery, Lewis Stone, Jean Hersholt. Directed by Edmund Goulding.

Queen Christina (1933/B&W/99 mins.): After more than a year away from movies, this was Garbo's return to the screen. ''Garbo Returns!'' was the tag line for the trailer. This was Garbo's first classic role. She plays the title role as the Swedish queen who rides into the countryside disguised as a man. There, she meets and falls in love with a dashing Hispanic man. They plan to marry, but she knows her people won't accept her marrying a foreigner. She must make a fateful decision. Co-starring John Gilbert and Lewis Stone. Directed by Rouben Mamoulian.

Anna Karenina (1935/B&W/93 mins.): Garbo portrays Anna Karenina for the second time (in 1927, she played her in Love), a dutiful wife and devoted mother, knows contentment but not passion. That changes when she meets ardent Count Vronsky. For him, she throws away her marriage, family, social position... and in the end, her very own life. Co-starring Fredric March and Maureen O'Sullivan. Directed by Clarence Brown.

Camille (1936/B&W/109 mins.): ''Garbo's best performance. Screen acting of the highest order.'' Perfectly cast as the courtesan Marguerite who becomes world renowned as Camille, Garbo is perhaps at her classic and elegant best her. Never more has she seemed so beautiful or mesmerizing. As it was once said, no one has ever looked better while dying from tuberculosis. Co-starring Robert Taylor and Lionel Barrymore. Directed by George Cukor.

Ninotchka (1939/B&W/110 mins.): ''Garbo Laughs!'' brought a freshness to Garbo's waning career in 1939. After years of dark romantic dramas, she finally delighted the world with a comedy. This is a hilarious tale of a Russian envoy sublimating her womanhood for Soviet brotherhood until she falls in love with a suave Parisian gentleman. Co-starring Melvyn Douglas and Ina Claire. Directed by Ernst Lubitsch.

Garbo (2005/B&W and Color/86 mins.): This exclusive TCM documentary is rather interesting and very informative. It includes interviews with Garbo experts and with people that new her best. Her nieces and nephews even provide their opinions in some parts. However, if you're a die-hard Garbo fan, there isn't anything here that you won't already know. But, as I said, it is a very good documentary, especially if you're a newcomer to who and what Garbo was.

To summarize these movies isn't an easy task. Greta Garbo, although renowned in her day, has been criticized today for being an over-rated actress. Personally, I don't think she was over-rated, but whether you think she was or not falls with your own knowledge. This is an impressive set, but yet at the same time, it's somewhat disappointing. Garbo's better-known films are here (Grand Hotel, Camille, Ninotchka), but it would have been very nice to see some of her earlier films (Romance, Inspiration, As You Desire Me) here as well. Even her final movie, the ill-fated Two-Faced Woman (1941), should have been included. I understand that her better works had to be included here to assure a better profit for Warner Brothers, but it still saddens me a bit. Maybe another Garbo set will come out in the future, or even better, all of her films will be made available on DVD. Overall, this is a very nice and appealing set. The prints and audio of all films are crisp and clear. It definitely won't disappoint, especially at this price.",1436918400,2,6344,5.084534101825168

2317607,1,B0009S4IJM,"I recently ordered this set and was disappointed and angered.  The quality of most of the videos is inexcusably poor; they appear to have been carelessly copied from scratched old prints. The opening scene of ""Camille,"" which is supposed to take place on a sunny day in Paris, looks instead to be occuring in a rainstorm of scratches. The images in most of the films are grainy, washed out with poor black and white balance. The degraded quality negatively impacts the appreciation of Garbo's art which involved subtle facial movements originally beautifully even lovingly captured by cameraman William H. Daniels in her best films.  ""Queen Christina"" is an acknowledged masterpiece of lighting, but all of the subtlety and dimension is gone from the version in this set, giving this great film a cartoony look. This set is inexcusable because superb prints of most Garbo films are available and have been shown recently.  This set is a shameful betrayal of a great artist by Turner Classic Movies and Warner Brothers. Disgraceful.",1418515200,13,1031,5.052941176470588

2317629,4,B0009S4IJM,"Garbo is still legend. She has a mystique that is still tangible today. Is she a good actress? I don't know, but she is an honest actress and physically embodies true emotion. In sound pictures, she is at times uncomfortable with dialogue and emotion. Physically she is very real, but whether it was a diconnect with the english language, or the fact that she perfected her craft in silent films and the transition was a little difficult, it is hard to say. I can say that when she is in tune with the words, she embodies her characters and she is physically and verbally remarkable. Garbo takes chances with her moments a lot of actors would be afraid to do. And I, for one, applaud those chances.
This collection is a fine example of some silents and her major sound films. From the silents to her first words in Anna Christie to ""Garbo Laughs!"" it is a fine collection",1374364800,4,871,4.484276729559748

As stated, my main interest is in the silent films and I'm very pleased with what's there. The prints vary in quality but even at the worst they are quite watchable.

2317641,5,B0009S4IJM,"Not new, but worth seeking out if you're a fan of classic Hollywood films and a devotee of the ethereal beauty and mystery that was Greta Garbo, GARBO - THE SIGNATURE COLLECTION is a glorious 10 disc celebration of Garbo, the enduring, luminous screen goddess of the 20s and 30s.

Born September 18, 1905 to a working class Stockholm family, Greta Gustafsson evolved into one of the most renowned -- and observed -- film celebrities of all time.  Ironically, she became even more famous for her oft-expressed desire to be left alone.  In her better films, included in this collection, her alluring, impossibly photogenic image still radiates a uniquely cold light.  This marvelous collection from Warner Bros. Home Video includes:

ANNA CHRISTIE
Eugene O'Neill's Pulitzer Prize play Anna Christie is Garbo's famous first talkie.  The disc also features the simultaneously filmed German version.  As the sensational Parisian dancer/spy Mata Hari, Garbo is a troubled, tragic seductress to whom men are drawn and doomed.

GRAND HOTEL
Academy Award winning Best Picture (1931-32), Grand Hotel is a literally multi-storied cross section of jaded, ruthless, fragile lives intersecting in one of Berlin's finest hotels.  ""People come, people go.  Nothing ever happens,"" says one world-weary patron.  But movie buffs know otherwise.  Garbo is a delicate, disillusioned ballerina.  Billed as the ""greatest cast in stage or screen history,"" other stars include John and Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford and Wallace Beery.

ANNA KERENINA
As Anna, Garbo risks everything for idealized love in Count Leo Tolstoy's still stirring romantic tale of Czarist Russia. The set features the hypnotic silent version of CAMILLE that co-stars a mesmerizing Rudolph Valentino.  And no Garbo collection would be complete without NINOTCHKA, Ernst Lubitch's classic comedy of romance in Paris.

Among the three silent romantic thrillers with commentaries is FLESH AND THE DEVIL (1927).  Garbo and real life lover John Gilbert burn the screen with their charisma and chemistry.  This title was selected for preservation in 2006 for inclusion in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""

A terrific exclusive to this set is Kevin Brownlow's revealing new documentary, narrated by Julie Christie, on the life, movies and mystique and of the ""Swedish Sphinx.""",1332979200,3,2421,5.442359249329758
2317642,5,B0009S4IJM,"She is one of the greatest movie stars in movie history, and every one of these films in this box set is a true gem. Even the great Bette Davis one said of Garbo... ""Her instinct, her mastery over the machine, was pure witchcraft. I cannot analyze this woman's acting. I only know that no one else so effectively worked in front of a camera."" Bette Davis.",1307577600,,355,4.313432835820896
2317643,5,B0009S4IJM,"This is one of the greated Classic Movie Collections containing 7 pictures and 3 Silents of Greta Garbo and 1 Documentary. Voted #5 on AFI's List of Hollywood Female Legends, Greta Garbo is a personal favorite of mine along with Bette Davis, voted #2. One critic once said that no one suffers, loves, or feels like Greta Garbo, and this is most evident in her Masterpieces Camille, Queen Christina, and Ninotchka. Those and Anna Karenina are my personal favorites. The Documentary is so insightful into Garbos personal life. I loved it. The Silents are mesmerizing. A great Collection. Love Garbo!",1288051200,2,597,4.98
2317644,4,B0009S4IJM,"I gave this set 4 stars simply because of what it contains. I would say that while the quality of the talkies is by no means bad, they would benefit from remastering and with such, this would be a 5 star collection, in my estimation. On the other hand, the Garbo Silents and the Valentino version of Camille are exceptional in quality. So if top quality is what you are looking for you may do better to purchase the Silents on their own and hope for some remastering of the talkies later. Personally if Grand Hotel is ever remastered I will upgrade. Again, not that Grand Hotel is by any means a poor print, its just that of all the films its my favorite and I would like to see a pristine copy.

This is one great collection plus the 86 min. documentary allowed me to learn and appreciate her so much more!  At the last few minutes of this documentary shows her very last screen test on May 25, 1949 for a movie but never made.  How incredibly tragic and sad.  My jaw just dropped of how beautiful she was at the age of 44 at the time, showing more of her personality.  I agree with the person saying..""What a waste of talent""  This should be the biggest mistake the movie industry has ever made.  She was willing to comeback but the industry ""stabbed"" her in the back by not making the movie which prompted her to never again comeback through the horrible and embarrassing experience.  Unbelievable!!

She should never ever be forgotten.  This is one unique special lady and there will never ever be another Garbo!",1243123200,4,971,4.497142857142857

The positives are obvious - a good selection of Garbo's best films, a good documentary about her career and some excellent commentaries on the Silents. In fact, the Garbo Silents disk shows the loving attention of the best TCM DVDs which leads to the disappointing aspect of the collection. Most of the prints of the talkies are poor. ""Queen Christina"", ""Camille"" and ""Ninotchka"", maybe her best films, warrant restoration. ""Anna Karenina"" does not even contain a complete print. There are no commentaries, a few theatrical trailers and ""Grand Hotel"" has an interesting newsreel of the premiere.  These films deserve better.",1189123200,11,765,5.071428571428571
2317649,4,B0009S4IJM,"This is an impressive set, by far the most economical way to get all of these movies in one place.  Since Garbo made so few films in her career, this is an excellent way to get a survey of her filmography, from her first silent MGM films to her later talkies.

My only real complaint is that the contents are not as filling as the overwhelming size of this giant cube of a package would imply.  Aside from the movies, we only get commentaries on the silent films; on Camille, we get the original silent version starring Nazimova and Valentino; Anna Christie includes the German language version, and Grand Hotel has the most extras on a disc.  Queen Christina, Anna Karenina, Mata Hari, and Ninotchka have nothing more than a trailer for extra features, and the Garbo documentary takes up a whole disc by itself.  Not that I expect Warner to load each DVD with unrelated content (although i have no objections to their ""night at the movies"" features), but what's really surprising is what's missing from each DVD that could have been included.  After all, it's not like Garbo hadn't already made a silent version of Anna Karenina with John Gilbert called Love that could have been put on that disc.  Ninotchka was remade as Silk Stockings, but you wouldn't know that from this set.

In summary, the movies and features just seem to be spread thin across 9 discs, the result is a set that takes up more space than is really necessary.  To put into perspective, the TCM Lon Chaney Collection also included 3 films with commentaries, as well as a documentary; this set could have easily consolidated those discs just the same.

With no other historical context, it would not be recommended to buy these DVDs separate from this set, especially if one was unfamiliar with Greta Garbo.",1185062400,12,1779,4.673076923076923

2317651,5,B0009S4IJM,"I`ve grown up with Garbo... Ever since I was a child, Swedish television has indeed appreciated her legacy and I`ve witnessed all the sound films mentioned here:

To my mind, what makes Garbo great is her wonderful sphinx face... and her melancholy, sad remarks... When called upon hysterics and outburts, she is painfully amateurish...

That goes for ANNA CHRISTIE, GRAND HOTEL, CONQUEST, AS YOU DESIRE ME....  In CAMILLE, NINOTCHKA and TWO-FACED WOMAN she shows us the actress, a girl who DID posseess nuances... method acting....

And never more so that in the silent FLESH AND THE DEVIL 1926.

In it she is a man-eater, a sultress, a she-devil and she she in only limited when call upon a confrontation scene with Lars Hanson`s sister...

The film has wonderful closeups of its three stars and the subject remains as fresh as it did in 1926. The scenes in the snow and how she seduces John Gilbert is quite good and I must say - FLESH AND THE DEVIL is still quite watchable even today.

To me the friendship between Gilbert and Hanson is a homosexual one and when Garbo falls through the ice - the men are seen embracing each other - and free of that devil Felicitas.

Their intense friendship fools no one in 2007, but 80 years ago it must have...

Garbo is only 21 in the film, but shows a mature display of acting and womanhood - no wonder the world fell for her and the same goes for the sound MATA HARI...",1171756800,4,1414,4.513725490196078

There is just something about Garbo that words cannot say. The TCM disc about her life was so good. It's hard to believe,however understandable, that she just walked away. What a loss to the screen. Barry Paris and Mark Veira have wonderful biographies available which explain her life story. I was just blown away like never before by the silents Temptress,Flesh and the Devil and Mysterious Lady. Camille is the story of Verdi's La Traviata. Anna Karenina is a period piece film of a Russian. Anna Christie is Garbo's first talkie. It takes 16 minutes before you hear the first ever line from her(Give me a Visky). Grand Hotel is loaded with stars such as the Barrymores and Joan Crawford in what may be her first movie.

Fortunately, my parents must have sensed it was on my wish list, regardless of its price, and bought it for me as a gift last Christmas. I just couldn't bring myself to take it back! The quality of this set is just too overwhelming. Not only do you get at least three classic film masterpieces (Camille, Queen Christina, and Flesh and the Devil), but also a whole selection of good Garbo films, ranging from obscure to highly popular. Mata Hari has always been a Garbo classic, even if it's not a masterpiece. Anna Christie was based on a great play and, although the production is stagy, the excellence of the story shines through. Anna Karenina is one of the best films in the lot--the photography alone is astonishingly beautiful. Ninotchka was an entertaining comedy, but probably my least favorite Garbo film. Grand Hotel speaks for itself as an enduring cinema legend, as do Camille, Queen Christina, and Flesh and the Devil.  What was Garbo's best film? It's a toss-up between these three timeless titles. It's also nice to have two very rare silents: The Temptress and The Mysterious Lady, even if these films are slightly less than stellar.

As far as quality goes, the set is teriffic. Picture quality is extremely good, but not perfect; I think we can blame this on the age of the films and not because of any disservice from Warner's. The prints are cleaned up very nicely, but just not as pristine as other releases such as Now Voyager or Mildred Pierce, which fairly glimmer. Very good quality, though.",1154131200,22,1625,4.8

2317659,5,B0009S4IJM,"This is a great ""signature"" collection of films starring that Swedish Sphinx, Greta Garbo.  I was a little dismayed at the barebones treatment the majority of these films got (nothing but a trailer for Ninotchka, Queen Christina, Anna Karenina, and Mata Hari), especially since WB likes to make sure all their catalog films at least get a short featurette and or a cartoon/live-action short, but the fact that these films are available at all make up for it.  After all, beggars can't be choosers.

Two gripes, though: the bonus documentary, Garbo, is neither close-captioned or given subtitles.  Also, if they were able to fit both versions of Camille on one side of a disc, why did they have to give Anna Christie the flipper treatment (two-sided disc)?

Would have also loved to seen Garbo's last silent film, The Kiss, but I'm sure they didn't have the resources or time to restore the film in time for the boxset (which came on Garbo's birthday)",1143936000,5,950,4.803680981595092
2317660,4,B0009S4IJM,"I can confirm Mr Sharafyan's observation. I have a tape, recorded in 1989, of a BBC transmission of Anna Karenina. In this version, and missing from the DVD, Garbo calls the boy on to the gondola and gazes at him for a moment before March gives him a coin and sends him back to his friends. At this point reel-change dots appear on the screen and there is a cut to a next-reel shot, with Garbo looking pensive and March saying 'We're still in Venice', which Garbo (thinking of her son) answers by referring to the look in the boy's eyes and suggesting they return to Moscow, as the scene fades out. On the DVD, without the segment of the boy actually on the gondola, Garbo's comment about the boy's eyes hardly makes sense because he is only seen doing cartwheels. Could there be any significance in the fact that the fragment missing from the DVD occurs at the end of a reel? An error in transferring the film to DVD?",1136419200,12,918,4.374269005847953

Well, let me tell you it was worth every penny.  The picture is crystal clear showing previous details of sets and costumes missed before.  And that face!!!

I was watching ""Queen Christina"" and early on in the movie there is a scene where Garbo's face is shown in profile and takes up the whole screen when she looks above and then says wearily, ""Must we live for the dead?""  The line itself isn't the important thing; it's that for just a split second time comes to a stop and you know you are witnessing something extraordinary.

2317665,5,B0009S4IJM,"As a long time Garbo fan, this set is worth the wait.
The documentary is excellent, and the features are everything you could want.  I was particularly interested and impressed with the silents, having seen only two, and them only once.
  ""Camille"" is my all time favorite movie.  That's it.  My favorite.  The story is a timeless love story set against the accepted mores of society.  There is the wonderful addition on the Camille DVD of the rarely seen (non-Garbo) silent version with Valentino as Gaston.  This silent version is often referred to in movie retrospectives for it's unusual and artistic sets in high Deco style.
  ""Anna Karenina"" is another classic of Garbo's and one of my favorites of her films - I've watched it at least 20 times.  It remains one of the best adaptations of this story to film.  The 2000 version with Sophie Morceau is a really wonderful pairing/contrast with this version.... shifting focus and social concerns, and adding color, but this black and white Garbo version remains equal to it.  Tarzan's Jane shows her real talent playing ""Kitty"" with lightness and vulnerability.
  ""Anna Christie"" is a stage classic that was altered very little for the film. It was the perfect choice to introduce Garbo to the world, and is the heartwrenching story of a woman who wants to forget her past and just live a simple life.  In retrospect, this is also what Garbo wanted for her own life, and that dimension only adds to the levels.  This one also includes the German version made with Garbo and her good friend and mentor in the Marie Dressler role.
  ""Ninotchka"" is Garbo's memorable comedy, later made into the musical Silk Stockings.  She makes fun of the serious impervious image created  by some of her other films, and it is a perfect foil for the overall serious tone of this set.
  ""Mata Hari"" is easy to dismiss as too camp, too melodrama, but it is beautiful to look at, both in its glitz, and its more severe moments.  We should all look so beautiful in prison when we are about to die.  It is a quintessential blending of Garbo's silent work and her early sound work.
  ""Queen Christina"" is probably her best work, with some interesting direction, with moments of eloquent silence that Hitchock began to move to in his later work.  One classic moment is referenced in many other movies.  Often said to be one of her own favorites, it has many moments of playful sexual ambiguity... and has been the springboard for the highly imaginative rumors of her ""lesbianism"".  Her nephew puts it best in the documentary.  She has a history of long and very open and public relationships with men; anything different from that is conjecture.  I'll add that having read almost every Garbo bio, the only person who difinitively states he knows she had a lesbian affair is a spurned lover who has a reputation for trying to spread untrue rumors about many of the legendary people he knew.  He simply is not a reliable source.
  I saved ""Grand Hotel"" for last.  Garbo herself knew she was miscast as a ballerina, and while it loks like her worst, most overwrought work, her flair as a silent actress was useful in the role of the overdramatic diva.  Prima ballerina's are actually more dramatic than this, so it is only her stature that makes this really laughable.  Still, it is a jewel.  It was the very first film to feature stars in every major role, and Joan Crawford shines.  Grand Hotel has the best work of several of it's stars, and it is eminantly watchable and enjoyable.
  Just a wonderful box set. It makes one long to be alone... to watch these DVDs again and again! The quality of the prints is great.  I rate this set much HIGHER than 5 stars.  For one supersized, undimmable star!",1129507200,8,3726,4.657450076804915

2317667,5,B0009S4IJM,"I am a huge fan of Greta Garbo, and I have seen all her movies more than once. I recently bought her Signature DVD collection and I was very happy to own it finally. I was watching ""Anna Karenina"" on the other day on DVD and I found out that a scene is missing from the movie. In that scene Greta Garbo's character Anna is with Frederic March's character Vronsky in Venice riding a gondola. Then, all of a sudden, a little boy comes to them and shows some tricks and Anna becomes very pleased to see him because he reminded her of her own son. She throws some coins to him. The missing scene is actually a part of this scene. That same boy brings all his friends from his neighborhood and they are all starting to do the same tricks as he was doing to get more coins. The whole scene takes approximately 5 minutes.

First, I thought that my DVD might have been defected, but I was so determined to find out that I actually bought another DVD just to prove myself that it is not defected. The production did skip that scene from the DVD. In May I went to see this movie on a big screen at UCLA and the scene was there.

2317670,5,B0009S4IJM,"I feel like a kid in a candy store as I gaze with anticipation at an expensive DVD boxed set I just bought from Amazon:  GRETA GARBO-THE SIGNATURE COLLECTION.  Manufactured by Warner Home Video, this is a good purchase for vintage film lovers and a younger generation who maybe wants to just see some compelling and mesmerizing silent and sound  romance.  I believe Amazon is selling the set for $70, but we are talking about ELEVEN MOVIES on ten disks that individually sell for $15-$20.

It is not Garbo's entire film output-another disk could be filled with what is missing.  But it has her finest films, like QUEEN CHRISTINA (1933), CAMILLE (1937), and NINOTCHKA (1939).  Also included are both the English-language and rare German-language versions of ANNA CHRISTIE (both 1930-and Garbo spoke fluent German), MATA HARI (1931), the Best Picture Oscar winner GRAND HOTEL (1932), and ANNA KARENINA (1935).  All of the sound films here at least include a theatrical trailer-it is fun to see how MGM promoted a given movie.  GRAND HOTEL includes a new documentary, a premiere newsreel, a vintage musical short, and trailers for both this and the WEEKEND AT THE WALDORF (1945) remake.  And CAMILLE includes the 1921 silent version starring Nazimova and Rudolph Valentino, a ""Leo is on the Air"" radio bonus, and the 1936 theatrical trailer.

As if all this were not enough for $70 (or even the $100 suggested price), we have three of the eight or so silent romantic classics Garbo made: FLESH AND THE DEVIL (1927), THE MYSTERIOUS LADY (1928), and THE TEMPTRESS (1926).  Quoting from the DVD box since I have not seen these silent films recently, FLESH co-stars John Gilbert, who was Garbo's lover at the time; their love scenes, ravishingly shot in luscious B&W by William Daniels, have an awesome sexual potency.  Garbo plays a woman who comes between two friends.  LADY has her as a Russian spy who seduces her victims.  The earliest of this trio, THE TEMPTRESS stars Garbo as a vanp who destroys men.  I am not sure whether she does this intentionally, or whether men cannot resist her charms.  These three silent films are studio prints with new music scores and audio commentaries by Greta Garbo biographers and/or scholars.  Also included on this dual-disk are alternate endings, photo montages for all three films, and the surviving 9 minutes of the ""lost"" THE DIVINE WOMAN (1928).

Finally, this magnificent-looking Warner Home Video treasure (I expect nothing less from them) has a brand-new 90 minute documentary called GARBO, by British film scholar and ace restorer Kevin Brownlow.  The film is narrated by Julie Christie, beautiful in her own right.  GRETA GARBO: THE SIGNATURE COLLECTION, sight-unseen, belongs in the library of everyone who has fallen under the divine Garbo's elegant and mesmerizing spell-or is about to.

Each movie is a completely different character of Garbo's and her acting is brilliant each time. What I love about Garbo's acting is there's a strong toughness in her --almost masculine like-- and yet she seems very feminine and vulnerable.
