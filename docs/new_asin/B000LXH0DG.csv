8164823,1,B000LXH0DG,"But for ""The Tenement"", whcih only one story was really good and ""Deadly Culture"" ,I would have thrown this dvd in the garbage. Dadly Culture had some terrible Special Effects, but, but was a decent movie. The Tenement movie I liked t he best was  of the boy obsessed with the horror movies and then became a killer himself. That one was very good; the best of the entire dvd. The special effects on the entire dvd was terrible. From not on, I will be fast forwarding to those two stories, if I decied to see them , which will be rare. The dvd  was only about seven dollars. I wish I could purchase those two strories and get my other five dollars back.

Goblin was absolutley terrible. The only thing worse than the directing was the writing. The only whing worse than the writing was the acting. The only thing worse than the acting was the story. The only thing worse than the stroy was the special effects. I am offended by the Middle Schoolers that put this garbage on the market. The first story in ""The Tenement"" was excellent and is feature length material. , If it were, then I would have been willing to pay feature length money for it. But , with the exception of ""Deadly Culture"", which, if the special effects had been better, would have been much better, and the first above mentioned story, this dvd is crappy.",1186531200,,1325,4.422131147540983
8164824,3,B000LXH0DG,"MAXIM MEDIA's ""Pendulum Pictures"" horror films are distributed exclusively by MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT. These movies are a throwback to the early '60s type of drive-in theater gorefests that were once popular with teens. If you're looking for big-budget state of the art special effects and top rank actors this series may not be right for you. Fans of murder, mayhem and maniacs will not be disappointed by this little collection, however.
