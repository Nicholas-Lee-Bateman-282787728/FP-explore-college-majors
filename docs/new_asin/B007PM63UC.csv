8520542,4,B007PM63UC,"Girl leaves the police academy after being blinded in an accident that left her brother dead. A year later she is a witness in a hit and run. At first discounted because of blindness, her keen senses get the attention of a hypertensive detective who asks for her help. Then another witness shows up with a very different account. Where lies the truth and what else is going on? 4+ stars.",1382140800,,387,4.464788732394366
8520543,4,B007PM63UC,"I have never been stalked by a serial killer but this movie TWICE has the villain down and the other characters run away rather than hitting him repeatedly with a heavy object. It was 'good' to see that not all the characters you like are guaranteed to survive. I liked the lead actress very much. I will have to look for her in other roles. Even though the viewer knows what car she gets in, the conflicting testimony of her and the 'eye witness' are a nice touch to send the police off in a different direction. The chase through the subway station was suspenseful. (Go! Go! No, left!) I almost cheered at the final confrontation between our heroine and the villain. Not a unique story idea but well executed and filmed.",1363651200,,722,4.4772727272727275

8520545,5,B007PM63UC,"I'm a huge fan of suspense movies, and 'Blind' would have to be #1 in the suspense category (out of the ones I've seen). Besides the rich story line, the suspense makes your heart beat faster and will have your fists clenched waiting for what's going to come next. The acting is also some of the best I've seen, Kim Ha Neul portrays the role so well, it's indescribable. This movie is intense, somber, and suspenseful; it should be more well-known than it is in America. I would recommend it to all movie lovers.",1350172800,4,512,4.457446808510638
