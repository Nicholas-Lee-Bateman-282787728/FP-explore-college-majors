Truly an inspiring film about a truly incredible lady, but I just wish the biologist who did so much good work on protecting the alpine flora of the Adirondacks would have kept his religion out of the film.  Not everyone appreciates being proselytized to about religion!  ...Rather inappropriate for this kind of film.",1522540800,,341,5.163636363636364
8693903,5,B00R3EJHTG,"Excellent story and production. The ""bonus features"" were great also, and a reminder of the difficult task it is to edit a tight story when there is so much good footage to work with.",1515974400,,183,4.411764705882353
8693904,5,B00R3EJHTG,"Well presented, very beautiful scener, but most importantly a great story.",1494806400,,74,5.818181818181818
8693905,5,B00R3EJHTG,"As a 46r with several of Grace's letters still in my possession, I was really pleased with the film.  The Adirondack experience was a big part of my growing up years with my father and even included introducing my sons to the peaks.  Grace was an important part of the experience.",1469923200,,280,4.470588235294118
