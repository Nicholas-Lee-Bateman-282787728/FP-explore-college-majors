The film is a top notch British Horror ? Scifi movie and the storyline is great.",1362009600,3,240,3.4444444444444446
2636924,3,B000HEVTKY,I received this item in a timely manner but did discover a small problem on receipt.  The DVD is european format and will not play on my DVD player.  I can use it on my computer so for the price it is still a good deal just a llittle inconvenient.,1360627200,2,247,3.92
2636925,5,B000HEVTKY,"Excellent DVD - unfortunately I could only find it in region 2 format, so won't play on most DVD players. This is the cream of British sci-fi from the 60's/70's era. Good overall plot despite a few places where credibility gets stretched a little thin. Obviously filmed on a tight budget but loosing nothing for it, much in the style of the early Dr Who series. Special effects quite convincing for the context. Great nostalgia for anyone knowing London from that time.",1327536000,3,469,4.7317073170731705
2636926,5,B000HEVTKY,"This is a story about Martian hybrids that came to colonize earth five million years ago. One of their ships went off course and ended up in the mud. The ship is found during a subway excavation and the fun begins.

When I was a youngster many movies gave me nightmares such as ""It Came from Outer Space"" (1953) where I kept seeing eyeballs. Now only one movie left to get over, you guessed it, this one. I can not look a grasshopper in the face. And as with most viewers I saw it on late night television as ""Five Million Years to Earth""

This film is logical and spooky especially by 1960's standards.  And you get all the stereotypes such as the military that is just determined that this object found buried is a bomb. It makes you want to slap him around. Then there is the professor that knows better and is ignored. I could go on. But you need to see this movie. The only thing that is stretching but fits in a sci-fi movie is the device that changes thoughts into pictures; see this setup again in ""Brainstorm"" (1983).

2636929,5,B000HEVTKY,"The Blu ray is region B and the DVD is Region 2, there are no video extras, but there is secondary audio interviews during playing of the movie. Quality is best it can be for this old of a movie. it is widescreen to 1:66 so there are very small bar bars on each side as 16x9 TV's are 1:78. Audio is dolby digital 2 channel mono. Audio is very clear. there is graining in the video and a few spots with overly contrast, giving it it a bit of washed out look, but all in all very pleased with the video. Mine played fine in a Oppo Blu ray player with a region adapter that can play any A<B or C or DVD at all region or 1,2,3,4,5,6, keep that in mind, when buying will not just play in a American region A or 1 player, will play on a PC if you use anyd$d to make it all region playable also.",1502323200,2,788,3.8404907975460123

2636932,5,B000HEVTKY,I saw this when I was little. Great film. I saw it recently and it still holds up. I haven't seen all the quartermass film but this was excellent. It was even better because I saw it in a drive in on a huge screen!,1500249600,,214,3.7777777777777777
2636933,5,B000HEVTKY,"I'm a big fan of the 1967 movie, so I wanted to watch the original TV mini-series. The film is a little aged at the beginning, but clears up nicely after it gets going. I liked the bugs and ape-men better in this series. And since the series is about twice as long as the 1967 movie, there's a lot more detail and explanation that wasn't covered in the movie.",1499644800,,359,4.142857142857143
2636934,3,B000HEVTKY,this is the review for the tv series which later was made into a much shortened movie. The movie version is one of my favorite science fiction pictures about how the earth was really colonized by giant grasshoppers.the tv series drags too much and feels padded.i highly recommend the movie but not the tv serial version by nostalgia family,1495843200,,339,4.762711864406779
2636935,3,B000HEVTKY,"This is a low-quality copy. If you want to see this show, and you font own a UK format DVD player, this might be your only option. You get decent sound and a really low resolution pictiure.",1493856000,,189,4.135135135135135
2636936,5,B000HEVTKY,"Surprising how well this classic old TV miniseries held my attention. Big fan of the movie by Hammer studios, saw this was at a reasonable price and I thought I would buy it and give it a try.
To my surprise I took it all in at one sitting. This was and is great rainy day watching. The production is very well presented and Andre Morell is excellent as Quatermass. The story is good sci fi and way ahead of it's time on subject matter for a TV science fiction story. I recommend this to any one who is interested in early TV. The show moves along at a fun pace keeping you interested and the limit of the budget do not deter from the show. Good old fashion black and white television with decent effects done on a low budget and still worth seeing to day.",1492992000,,756,4.149659863945578
2636944,5,B000HEVTKY,"Bought this for the fact that it is one of the best sci fi movie made. It is dated but any serious fan of the genre should add this movie to their collection.
Made by Hammer it has a stellar cast and an excellent story about the invasion of earth done in the time of ancient man. The cast has Barbara Shelley a very under rated actress who steals the show with her looks and charm. She gives a very subtle performance.  She also was the vampire female in Dracula Prince of Darkness with the iconic scene of her staking by the monks. Yet most people even fans of horror and sci fi do not know her. Great shame!
This is a region B bluray and will not play on most USA bluray players will need a multi-region bluray player.",1491782400,2,720,4.142857142857143

This particular movie is a bore compaired with 5 Million Years to Earth. The same plot but this is a terrible version of the plot. For my money, this was a waste.",1489622400,4,285,4.107142857142857
2636946,5,B000HEVTKY,"Ya know what? There are a number of Multi-Region or (Region Free) Blu Ray players available right here on Amazon.
So listen folks, rather than unfairly give this movie a one star rating because you can't play it on your (U.S. only) Blu Ray player,
go purchase a (Region Free) Blu Ray player like I did quite some time back, and you can play all these non US region movies without any fuss.

2636948,4,B000HEVTKY,I like it but realize it is circa late-50's B&W television. Nevertheless this is first-rate science fiction for fans of the genre.,1487808000,,130,4.954545454545454
2636949,5,B000HEVTKY,"I had a vague memory from my teens of the climax scene (from a later movie version it turns out) and got curious what that movie was, and found out it was this story. This one with the 2 guys and the creature on the front cover is the original British late 50's mini-series (3 hour total). It's very well done! As soon as I started watching I got engaged in it. The British story telling unfolds very well and very logically as they try to figure out what they unearthed at the construction site. There's no cheesy special effects of some movies of that time, and the effects they have are very well done for that period. It doesn't distract at all and left me very impressed. And the backdrop of the series is very interesting of Britain in the post-war period. For me, this movie sits very well on the shelf next to Village of the Damned (another British classic), Invasion of the Body Snatchers original, and Twilight Zone series. And by the way, if ""Quatermass"" just doesn't translate to you like it didn't me(!), it's one of the character's names - professor Quatermass! And it plays fine on my US Blueray/DVD player as other people noted.",1486944000,,1144,4.478468899521531
2636950,5,B000HEVTKY,"Although my intent was getting the American version (5 million years to earth) of this, I was most pleased with the Quatermass UK version.  The idea that it was originally segmented for television (which makes sense) makes suspending belief even easier.  The storytelling and acting were excellent and the characters compelling.",1486857600,,328,5.411764705882353
2636951,4,B000HEVTKY,"The discs have no scene selection so stopping in the middle of an episode is a problem.

2636953,5,B000HEVTKY,"Well firstly i need to say - Having ordered this DVD BEFORE reading some of the reviews, i became very concerned this DVD would not play in my USA format player. However it played just fine in mine so i do not know what the issue is in some of the prior reviews (?)
Having said that, on with the film(s) review. I have waited DECADES for this to finally pop up on DVD in the USA & my patience has been greatly rewarded. Already being a huge fan of the ""Five Million Years To Earth"" remake, and having heard it slagged forever in comparison to the original i was eager with anticipation. Now that i have seen it I STILL LOVE the remake, but the original is indeed brilliant also and everything i had heard. The longer running time allows for  a more slowly unfolding and moderately more detailed plot plus i like the pacing. Still i will have no issue rescreening either film through time. Some of the special effects are superior in comparison in each version - the 'rising devil' image at the end of the remake & climax scenes i personally enjoyed more. The ship in the original is more interesting. The Martians more gruesome in the latter, the street setting better in the former... these comparison could go on at length but i think i have touched on the main issues. The extended dialogue (hence explanation of the entire unfolding plot) plus character development of the former are better, but not by all that much. The latter did a nice job of combining a character or two (surely to shorten the running time) and eliminating an unnecessary 'romantic' angle, but whatever.
The special effects in the remake are more 'sensational' and the pace more harrowing, but the more subtle effects in the original are quite good also and the more languid pace of the coming Armageddon more realistic.
Hence what i am saying is, one should see and enjoy both for the great films they are and stop quibbling over which is the better, to my mind it's a waste of time. Both have their strong suits and are 5 STARS in my book anyway.
Finally i would add for USA buyers, GET THIS DVD before it disappears folks - this film (actually, both do) has a way of vanishing from availability for indefinite periods.",1477785600,10,2197,4.4925

2636956,5,B000HEVTKY,"I am really happy to finally have this movie in my video collection! This was a film I watched as a 11-16 year old when it used appear on tv before cable existed. My parents and I used to watch it whenever it came on (it was shown in the US under the title of Five Million Years to Earth and until I discovered what it was called in Britain, I couldn't find it anywhere). We loved it and to finally get it in Blue Ray is fabulous! I have a non-region specific player that plays it and everything else I own. The color and sound of the blue ray is great, it never looked this good on a 19-inch B/W set or even the 25-inch color one we got a few years later. It was one of the best films Hammer productions ever did and even though it was filmed in 1967, it is not as dated as I thought it would be. It is fun to see the parts of London it was filmed in and how much they have changed since then. The 60's mod clothing on the people is great to see also. It is almost fifty years since they made it and it still looks fantastic!",1474934400,11,1026,3.867298578199052

This movie is a great film also known as 'five million years to earth'  and it is one of the best sci fi films of the 60's.  It scared the hell out of me when I was a kid too.  They find a old space craft in the underground of europe , which unleashes the force of the long dead occupants , which takes control of peoples minds.  Before the wild ending this is just scary , with a  lot of atmosphere, then it morphs into a sci fi blast off with london being wiped out basically by the power of the mind.  It is that wild of a movie and this is the second film , I think in the series of quartermass films. the blu ray looks great too.

2636979,5,B000HEVTKY,"Terrific.  It's very much like the movie version, except twice as long, so everything develops in a much more leisurely fashion.  In comparing it to the movie version, I'll admit that I think the movie having Andrew Keir and Barbara Shelley is a big point in the movie's favor.  Nevertheless, the actors in this TV version do a great job and I can't fault them in any way.  Because it is a TV version, I fully expected the spaceship effects to be pretty lame, or missing, but that's not the case; while not *quite* as good as the spaceship in the movie, it and its effects are terrific for the time and place and medium.  Highly recommended.  It makes me curious about the other Quatermass TV episodes, since the movie versions of those are (for me, at least) highly forgettable.",1454976000,12,779,4.5285714285714285

2637011,4,B000HEVTKY,"As a child in the early 1960s, my parents told me about the Quatermass serials that they had seen on the Beeb, before they dragged my brother and I away from Pommieland, and the doctors who wanted to remove our tonsils.

I first saw this as a grimey b&w in the late 60s. About the same time, a mate introduced me to a Goon Show version of this story, which it follows quite closely, called ""The Scarlet Capsule"". A gem.

I saw this in color in about 1971, crap print that was too. However, as a very early ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" it stands up very well to modern inspection.
As a glimpse at the look of a Britain still recovering from WW2, it's worth a look.
There are periods of, by today's standards, true campiness....intense scientists chasing their personal convictions, a stuffy senior military man who comes to a sticky end, a pretty female scientist, Mr Plod type police officers, and simple but effective tradesmen. and the hero scientist who saves the human race by sacrificing himself.

The story posits that modern humans are the result of genetic manipulation of our ancestors by a race of giant Locust-like creatures from Mars, some 5 million years ago, and that our baser instincts are remnants of such manipulation, which, given a trigger, will result in  destruction of the species.. Many movies have treated of this since, but few have been as effective, or genuinely scary. It has a certain authenticity not evident in more recent technically clever versions.
No-one does grime and grubbiness as well as the Poms or French.

The print/copy is very good, the sound at times muddy.
This one of those movies that deserves to be preserved.
Watch it....then get hold of Spike Milligan's take on the story.",1363132800,11,1728,4.7275747508305646
8139421,5,B000HEVTKY,Love this BBC series very much.  Much better than the later movie version.  Andre Morell was a far better Quatermass than Brian Donlevy.,1523923200,,136,4.869565217391305

8139426,5,B000HEVTKY,"Buyer beware! This set includes both Blu-ray and a DVD. The Blu-ray will ONLY play on a region 2 player. It will not play on a region free player! That aside, the movie is a first class production, and well worth the effort. I had to watch the DVD version, but it was still great, after all these years.",1510790400,,303,4.1525423728813555

8139428,5,B000HEVTKY,I've been looking for this movie for years. Bought it even if it's region 2. Got it anyway figuring I'd find a way. Came with 2 Disks. First announced I couldn't play it. Second plays fine in my Xbox. Minor lip sink issues. Don't care.,1509235200,,235,4.2444444444444445
