660433,5,6303481264,"It is not every day that one is able to see such a fine movie as Wings of Honneamise.  This movie takes on what is usually too much for one movie.  Besides the obvious plot about a space program, this movie deals with war,  politics, friendship, religion, love, morality, the sanctity of childhood,  homelessness, and a man trying to find himself.
The movie starts off  slow, but if you don't pay close attention at the beginning, one of the  most intriguing parts of the movie will be lost to you.  At the beginning  of the film, Shiro Lhadatt is shown to be a goof off, one who does not care  where his life is going... until something seemingly unimportant happens to  him (see the movie, I don't want to give away anything).  From this point  on, he is serious, dedicated, but also shown to be carrying a lot of pain  inside - this change in character is possibly a little too sudden, but  important and very thought provoking nonetheless.  He unwilingly is thrust  into the spotlight and is hoisted as a scapegoat for many of the country's  problems.  This movie thankfully keeps the supporting characters to a  minumum, and each is round and diverse.  I am not going to say too much  more about the movie, only that the ending of this movie is the most  glorious and magnificent ending of any anime I have ever seen (and better  than most of the regular movies I have seen for that matter).  I earnestly  reccomend watching it multiple times - like most good animes, it can only  be fully appreciated after being watched 4 times or so.  Please E-Mail me  with comments on my review or the movie in general - I love discussing  movies like this.",947808000,11,1650,4.47972972972973
660434,5,6303481264,"It was a very strange experience watching Wings of Honneamise.  The story started out fairly slow, so I just kept up with the dialogues and try to grasp the plot and its surroundings.  And at some point, I lost track of  everything and became completely hypnotized into its world.  How did that  happen?  This is what I think.
There's nothing spectacular about the  storyline.  Rather, it is straight forward and plain.  But that seems to be  the secret ingredient in this film.  It deals with something subtle, yet  quite meaningful; our daily lives.  The film is about a man, living in  another world not unlike earth, trying to be the first one in space, while  everything else around him is falling apart from the war and politics.  It  revolves around how he deals with ambition, worries, stress, happiness,  religion, friendship, and even love.  And because of the commonality of  underlying theme, I felt drawn to the main character, his world and his  dreams.
When the movie was over, and the hypnotism wore off, I didn't  think too much of other amazing elements in Wings of Honneamise, such as  spectacular graphics and incredible rocket launch sequence.  All I could  think of was the portrayal of a man who would do anything to live out his  dream, travelling beyond the bounds of sky.  A portrayal, not too far off  from that of our own.",946512000,9,1350,4.702586206896552
660435,3,6303481264,I was a little disappointed in this movie. The reviews raised my expectations. It was not as good as I expected. I kinded expected something as great as Akira. It's not a bad movie I just felt it lacked a certain air  of seriousness. Though I do think it's worth the money.,939254400,,273,4.25

660437,4,6303481264,"The story is about The Royal Space Force, it is a special team of people that want to be the first into space.  This is an alternate reality and alhtough the culture has excelled in some technology like weapons and other  things they have not yet been into space.  It is a lot like Final Fantasy 7  in that sense.  The government is on the edge of war with another country  and is not sure if they want to spend money on the space program.  It  depicts the training, which is very interesting, and it also shows the  conflict between religion and science. It was a nice break from some of the  ""cutsie"" and ""violent sci-fi"" animes that the market  has been flooded with.  Go check it out.  I reccomend it highly.",913766400,,712,4.303030303030303
660438,5,6303481264,"Wings of Honneamise is the first theater version animation of GAINAX , which later creates Neon Genesis Evangelion. It was released in 1984 in Japan, directed by Hiroyuki Yamaga at that time age of 24. Even though it gained little success on busines base at that time, even today, well loved and supported.

660563,5,6303481264,"I GOT THIS MOVIE, FOR THE BOYFRIEND. ONE OF HIS ALL TIME FAVORITES. AMAZON WAS SUPER CHEEP AND THE ONLY PLACE I COULD FIND IT.",1302307200,,126,4.08
660564,4,6303481264,"Unlike ""Apollo 13"" and similar astronaut dramas where the flight itself is the focus, this anime is all about the preparations surrounding the nation of Honneamise's first rocket launch that will put a man in space for the first time. In this world, this is a crackpot idea utterly disregarded by everyone as crazy and useless. So much so that even though the main character's life dream was flying fighter planes, his (bad) grades only leave him the Royal Space Force as an option.
I have to admit that I was going ""Come on, launch now!"" more than once but the slow-burning drama builds up to a very satisfying and apotheosic ending where everything comes together. The words ""One small step for man..."" are paraphrased in the movie and this is basically the idea: it brings back that feeling of the Space Program as a glorious endeavor that has so been lost in the decades since the Apollo program.
Seldom I've seen a world in a movie or anime so exquisitely crafted as this one. And I'm not just talking Miyazaki-style steampunk gadgets and Soviet-style booster rockets, but minute details such as the way people celebrate something or how they say goodbye when a ship is leaving. These details are all over the movie and are like little easter eggs that suddenly give a lot of depth to the world.
""Honneamise"" presents the point of view as well that it's utterly Earthly concerns such as greed, war and social struggle that keep us away from the stars. Still, like all knowledge-for-knowledge's-sake scientists and explorers the Space Force makes do, trying to sell their soul as little as possible to the establishment machine in order to reach their goals no one else believes in. Mankind is portrayed as a centaur: part lofty purpose, part beastly aggression.

On a technical note, the anime shows its age mostly in its 80's avant-garde music and the character designs; however, it is marvelously animated (check out the explosions and rocket blasts, they are simply awesome). Its main drawback seems to be its slow-pace and for that it didn't earn 5 stars for me, for this will effectively keep away a lot of viewers. However, for those who stay, the experience is well worth it.",1196726400,2,2187,4.770448548812665

Secondly, this is a great movie and while the HD version is an upgrade over previous versions it is far from perfect and shows it's age with grain and some flat colors.

660567,5,6303481264,"Royal Space Force and the man in the middle of it all. Wings of Honneamise tells a great underlined story that many young people can relate to. It is the follow your dreams story of Shirotsku Ladat, a young man who had desires to be a pilot, but because of his ""averageness"" he took the next best thing: a fledgling space program underlined by his country's military. The military space program is not fully respected and with the recent failed attempt launching a pilot into space (the pilot dies in the attempt), The Royal Space Force is at a stand still and suffers termination unless they can get another  pilot. In a quest to become greater than he is and to be the pilot he dreamed to be, Shirostku(or Shiro as they call him), decides to step up to the challenge. And the adventure begins from there. A great movie, with tons of comedic and thought provoking moments. And a great musical score by Ryuichi Sakamoto as well. It's extremely hard to find on DVD, So HD-DVD heads out there, I recommend you pick this one up.
I am usually very fickle about the English dub of Anime. I sometimes find the acting flat and not as emotionally intense as the original Japanese voice acting, but this movie was a pleasant change. The voice acting is quite good.",1186012800,10,1255,4.504385964912281

660570,5,6303481264,"Some other reviews that rate this DVD low seem to be pointing out its video quality, not the film itself. This DVD, however, I bought at Hawaii had none of those problems to play on my DVD player at home in Japan. It's unfortunate for such reviews to be wrongly lowering its Average Customer Review.

I am Japanese living in Japan. I watched this film for the first time at the theater after reading Hayao Miyazaki's preview that had praised it to the skies.

""What a film,"" I thought myself. It successfully creates a RETRO PARALLEL WORLD of ours, having nothing to do with fantastic robots or supernatural forces in space operas.

As a Japanese, in order for the foreign audience not to misunderstand the culture of the WORLD shown in the film, I have to say it is none of Japanese, Chinese, or Korean one. The film crew seems to have invented it so that even the Japanese audience can find it quite ethnic. It looks like Mongolian or Bhutanese culture if I may say so.

Lastly I'd like to mention some differences between Japanese and English versions of the film. In the Japanese version, people belonging to the enemy country speak in an imaginary foreign language, which is not even Greek to me, so the picture has Japanese subtitles for it, successfully giving the Japanese audience the feeling that they are really foreigners to the heroes' country.

The enemy fighters often shout like, ""An Zhad Rhy!"" as a salute after briefing and just before attacking. It is translated into ""God bless you,"" in the subtitles.

Cooooooooooool!!",1140393600,8,1539,4.723880597014926
660571,1,6303481264,"I bought the 12"" laserdisc release of this movie some years ago, and the colors are vivid, the edges are sharp, and I could find little to complain about except they messed up the subtitles in several spots -- they were actually missing in certain scenes.

But laserdisc is a dead format. Now comes the DVD, and they've ruined the movie. The colors are washed out. Edge enhancement is very prominent and annoying. If you are watching on a progressive monitor -- the deinterlacing is bad. The picture looks fuzzy, in spite of the edge enhancement.

I thought the Return of Sherlock Holmes DVD transfers were bad, but this is worse. Shame, shame on all who had a hand in releasing this DVD edition.

EDITED as of 11/09/2007: There is a new version, a new transfer of this movie, in a combination HD-DVD and standard DVD package. I believe there is a Blu-Ray version too, also containing a standard DVD in the package. They have fixed the video problems I complained about in the original DVD release. I'm glad they finally got the mastering right. It's a beautiful rendering of a beautiful film. Overpriced, though.",1130544000,30,1113,4.697435897435898
660641,1,6303481264,"I consider this film to be second only to Akira, in terms of Anime. It's a really wonderful story, and a very thoughtful one too. Unforunately, this has about the worst quality I have ever seen on a DVD. I have the VHS version of this, and it's much better. This one is so bad, that i'm surprised they haven't been recalled or a public apology has been given.

Unfortunate.

660642,5,6303481264,"Directed by Hiroyuki Yamaga, Honneamise is a country on another planet fractured on every conceivable social, political, and religious level. The story chronicles the ridiculed Royal Air Force and underachieving cadet Shiro Lhadatt, who volunteers to be the first astronaut to be sent to space. It is a homologue of the feat accomplished by Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin with all of the political melodrama and public ridicule leading up to the event.

The base where this action takes place is blatantly, beautifully similar to Edwards Air Force. From rocket sleds to the giant hangars containing the conical-shaped orbiter and service module. When they show the giant engine nozzles, the lines, valves, pumps and manifolds articulating it with the service module are obsessively detailed. The training montage has Lhadatt being put through every simulation imaginable to prepare him for space travel. He is bound to a gyroscope and spun like a top. Another scene shows Lhadatt pedaling away on a contraption of coiling, serpent-like tubes on a fixed platform. He has to solve three-dimensional puzzles underwater. He free-falls hundreds of feet off a bridge with a bungee rope around his waist.

There are references to World War II in some of the films many designs. The aircraft Shiro trains in bears a striking resemblance to the Mitsubishi J7W1 Shinden, a Japanese fighter. Shiro's fictional plane has the same canard design, that is, the wings and propellers are attached to the tail section and the stabilizers are on the front, same as the J7W1. The rocket in the movie is a combination of the Soviet ICBM R7 from the Cold War and the SIVB stage of NASA's Saturn rocket. The appearance of the fictional rocket corresponds to the actual R7 wherein four strap-on, first stage, rockets surround a central `sustainer' motor. The American component of the film's rocket is the use of liquid hydrogen in the upper stages of the vehicle's ascent. Kerosene is heavier, cheaper and more practical in the early stages when a rocket is encumbered by gravity. The huge nozzle depicted on the `sustainer' section of the film's rocket is identical to the enormous J2 engines used on Saturn rockets.

The world of Honneamise is replete with art/high-tech fusions in everything from train and automobile designs, to furniture and even ceremonial uniforms. Medleys of ornate, curly angles suggest the Art Nouveau movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Visual information is programmed into every frame and I was convinced that the artists had catalogued strange relics from an alien museum they'd visited.

The ambience of the film's music is a world all its own. New Age tones underscore each scene. When Lhadatt gives his homily from orbit, softened acoustics draw the viewer inside of the capsule. The diminutive planet outside of his window elevates the viewer into the vastness of higher consciousness. Music of Lhadatt's earthly experiences is chaotic, fast-paced and intense. His encounter with a young devout named Riqunni Nonderaiko is introspective. Ryuichi Sakamoto, who won an Oscar for The Last Emperor composed the film's music.

At the age of twenty-four, Hiroyuki Yamada formed Gainax and produced a four-minute film for the Bandai Corporation. A budget of eight hundred million yen (approximately $8 million U.S.) was subsequently awarded to make the film. More than 3,000 talented animators collaborated on the project. Groups went on research expeditions to the U.S. A team visited the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. to study aircraft design, space hardware and watch early footage of space launches. For the movie's postmodern look, a group toured New York City to study its architecture.

Wings didn't enjoy the popularity that Spirited Away, Ghost and Akira did after Anime gained widespread appeal. And like Kubrick's 2001, the film polarizes those who love it, and those who don't. It doesn't have a lot of action, which makes it hefty at two hours and five minutes. But Honneamise is a masterpiece of art and a testament to animation's power to convey the director's vision precisely. Wings of Honneamise is one of the best sci-fi features ever made, anywhere.",1123027200,2,4208,5.144736842105263
660643,5,6303481264,"Japanese animation scores not only on fantastic music and mind blowing graphics but also on the content and ""Wings of Honneamise"" is no exception its one great movie by director Hiroyuki  Yamaga. The plot and graphics are very vividly picturised. I love every bit of this movie.",1105488000,,278,4.914893617021277
660644,5,6303481264,"A fellow Beatles fan and I say this about Abbey Road, one of the band's final albums: it wouldn't matter what cuts came before so long as the album ended with the classic song cycle Golden Slumbers / Carry That Weight / The End.  Those pieces alone suffice to make it one of their very best, most fulfilling works.

I have a similar feeling with Wings of Honneamise.  The end of this movie is one of the most touching and perfect moments in all of the cinema I have experienced, alone propelling it among my favorites.  Unless I'm in a particularly cynical mood it will elicit tears every time, and I'm not an especially emotional kind of guy.  This is not to say that the rest of the movie is not worth seeing...as with Abbey Road, there is a lot to like in Wings.  But if you're like me, that ending will keep you coming back time and time again.

The most obvious strengths of Wings are its animation and soundtrack, both of which are immediately appreciable as superior.  What is not as easy to get into is the story's languid, at times disjointed pace.  Doubtless many would find it just plain boring, which is not far from my initial reaction.  But give it time, and you'll discover the many nuances of style and the appeal of the characters.  Wings is a fully-realized work of art, an engagingly-creative mirror on human nature.  It is not a popcorn movie you can just pop in and enjoy, although there are some well-done action sequences towards the end.  Instead it's a mood movie, something to absorb and relax to.  Indeed, more than any movie I have ever seen, it's a movie to make you think.  Along with the stellar ending, this trait has made it one of the most-played movies in my collection.  If this sort of thing sounds appealing to you, then I highly recommend Wings.",1094947200,3,1784,4.459876543209877

660647,5,6303481264,"""The Wings of Honneamise"" is one of the greatest anime ever produced. It is superb science fiction storytelling at its absolute best. Rather than give us giant mecca or huge-chested women, we get a stirring story about a race that is constantly at war with each other. A flight into space provides hope for the planet which, it is revealed at the end, is not Earth. While there are religious characters in the story, the film never preaches, since its religion is entirely made up. Instead, it concentrates on the message that man can achieve great things if we all work together. This is one of my all-time favorite films not just because of its science fiction background or its animation, but for its interesting characters and incredible situations. It is a very adult, mature cartoon that blows anything by Disney out of the water. The sex in this movie is violent instead of sensual and the violence is hopeless instead of exciting. Another interesting part of this film is the music, which seems to create a genre all its own and accentuates a different surrounding making everything surreal. Yet while the story is very serious in nature, there is also humor in all of the sadness, a quality that should be noted. While the voice dubbing fails on some parts, the overall story and scope of the film is amazing and makes this one of the best of the Japanese cinema.",1039478400,4,1372,4.6735537190082646

Stagnant plot, poor characterisation, but attractive stylistically.",1034726400,4,395,5.827586206896552
660649,5,6303481264,"Wings of Honneamise is, to simply put, a fabulous film. It comes closest to realize the true potential of animated film as a powerful medium that can stand side-by-side with its live-action counterpart.
Well-crafted plot, deep and believable characters as well as intricate animation. All of these are enough to make this film one of the finest animated film ever made. It is really impressive to know that the whole sequence of this superb animation are hand-drawn, frame by frame, by almost 3000 dedicated animators.
On the DVD side, this is a wonderful package with loaded of extras. I DID NOT experience anything that could be describe as ""poor quality"" throughout this feature. It's really not as bad as those public outcries would have you believe. However, I viewed this DVD on the DVD drive of my computer, using software called ""POWER DVD"". The result was clear and crisp, bright and colorful. I noticed that this film wasn't as superbly remastered and transfer as AKIRA, but it could be that this film isn't as popular so they didn't take such an expensive remastering process like what they did with AKIRA. However, it's visual quality is far and away better than what you would get from VHS.
It might be true that the DVD responds differently with different DVD players. Unfortunately, I didn't try it with any other DVD players apart from my computer so I can't really confirm that. But I can recommend that if you don't have satisfying result when viewing with your DVD player, try it on the computer. Computers usually don't reject DVD the same way some DVD players do; that is the advantage of seeing DVD on a computer. I know that most people don't buy computer to watch movies, but if you have a computer with a DVD drive then give it a try. You might not utterly despise it.",1030147200,3,1793,4.695238095238095

Unfortunately, everyone who has written a review with more than one star has done you a diservice:  This DVD is poor quality.  Primarily, any time there is any quick action on screen, bars will appear over the picture.  Second, the picture is not sharp at all, akin to a well used VHS.

660713,4,6303481264,"This is a flawed film, to be certain.  However, its main problem is perhaps that it is an animated film with aspirations that are too high for the likely audience.  This is also, in a way, its strength.
In presenting a film that is deliberately paced and deals with philosophical subject matter, the creators have certainly presented anime fans with an ""odd man out"" in the genre.  The film has no superheroes, no futuristic high-tech battles, and no coquettish schoolgirls.  Instead, they have given us (especially those of us too young to have witnessed the moon landing) a new look at mankind's seemingly inherent desire for knowledge (Cold War ideology included), and the conflicts that arise when that drive confronts other instinctual urges, such as the thirst for power.  But the filmmakers take it a step further by suggesting that such awe-inspiring advances in science may not be compelling enough in and of themselves that we can ignore the plight of the poor in favor of experiments that don't seem to have any immediate benefit for the populace (and make no mistake about it-- a fair number of Americans were opposed to the moon landing for that very reason).
Ultimately, the film plays out as an attempt to unify faith and science, without compromising either-- yet it thankfully refuses to provide the viewer with any pat answers.  Obviously, the creators were aiming high.  The film is lacking in the characterization department, and some of the principals' motivations remain unclear, or overly simplistic.  At the same time, the story tends to introduce storylines and then leave them underdeveloped.  That's bound to happen, maybe, given the goal the creators set for themselves, but it still takes away from the film's ultimate impact.
Nevertheless, in spite of its flaws, the result is a dramatic film that has as much substance as pretty much anything playing at your local arthouse theater, and it has a stunning (although somewhat dated) soundtrack by Ryuichi Sakamoto (of 'Last Emperor' fame) besides.  Never released stateside, it is still in print in Japan, twenty years after the fact.
Ultimately, 'Wings of Honneamise' manages to be pro-science and optimistic about faith at the same time, even as it presents the pitfalls of dogmatism on both sides ...  The scene was troubling, but there for a reason; namely to remind us that we're human in spite of our best intentions, I would suggest, though we may try our best rise above it-- and that applies to both characters in the sense that he failed to overcome his sexual urges in favor of a 'higher calling' and that she failed to overcome her desire for some abstracted personal reward in favor of a more tangible temporal justice,as most contemporary liberal Americans (including myself) would view it).
It goes without saying that some of the artistry of the film seems to be lost in the translation (the Japanese version emphasizes a more general spirituality along the lines of a belief in some greater purpose ((suggesting that it might even be nothing more than a biological drive), while the translation comes across as more essentially Christian), although as dubbed versions of anime go, this is top-notch and well-acted.
This is an ambitious film, and it's an art film, make no bones about it.  It's not a bona fide classic, but if you're interested enough to have read this far, you really can't go wrong by giving it a look.  As an attempt to reconcile faith and reason, the end result is a minor statement that manages to be both spritual and secular at once-- in spite of the inherent contradictions.
Strongly recommended, with reservations.",1025308800,2,3635,4.939344262295082

With live-action sci-fi, there are too often cheesy effects and horrendous makeup.  Nothing is compromised in animation.
The Wings of Honneamise is fantastically animated.  I was very impressed.  Every last detail is very fine-tuned.  The pieces of machinery remind me very much of the manga of Masamune Shirow (who made the comic that inspired Ghost in the Shell).  It's beautiful.
There's not a lot of action in the Wings of Honneamise.  Like the Patlabor movies, there's simply more to it than explosions and chaos.  There was obviously a lot of thought put into this movie.  It's one of the best animes out there.",1016323200,,784,4.819548872180451

To my disappointment this DVD is riddled with encoding problems. The picture is fuzzy and toward the layer switch it breaks up (pixelization). I own about 250 DVDs many of them with dual layers and this is the only one that has this problem. I know this DVD may react differently to different players. But my Panasonic did not like this disc.

660716,3,6303481264,"You would think that 19 year olds are half the population of the planet, since so many films are made from that viewpoint.
Meaning, the viewpoint that mankind is generally bad, mean, cruel, stupid - generally hopeless.
Of course, many people never grow up to become 20 year olds, and stay 19 all their lives - especially professors and artists - artists like the constant parade of filmmakers who make movies about what they perceive as the hopeless state of mankind.
This film ""cleverly"" takes place on a planet ""just like our own"" (amazing coincidence, eh?) - of course, so that the filmmaker can only deal with his own personal conception of what is ""the important"" aspects of life on our own planet.  For example, there is a religion on this planet, and it has a book, but since it is another planet, the filmmaker can remove those aspects of religions that he finds inconvenient or disturbing.
As many anime films do, this one ends with a string of platitudes (cf the otherwise superior ""Ghost in the Shell"") that sound good, but have little meaning other than impressing the 19-year-old-at-heart viewers until they go on to the next thing in their lives.
In terms of art and animation quality, this is far inferior to ""Akira"" or ""Macross Plus"" (two of the only intelligently scripted animes I have come across so far, but I admit to only having seen about half of the more acclaimed works.)

660720,3,6303481264,"Enter a parallel world where television is black and white, the setting is art deco, strife is everyday life and man is struggling to reach into space.
The main character is Shiro, a middle of the road kid who is the most unpromising cadet in a class of washouts in a space program that is held to be little more than a joke.  Lacking inspiration he finds it in the form of the beautiful but troubled religous girl.  Shiro decides to try and be the first man in space and so begins the saga of getting there with all the odds stacked against him.
The story of WOH is very innovative and the setting is very unique.  However i felt the film moved a little too slowly in many parts and lacked the visceral quality that it could have eaaily pulled off had it been more coherant and better structured.
The film had some very definitive moments though (such as the beginning and the end) but sadly couldn't keep them up.  Its a real shame because i think this film had real potential with the characters, story and setting.  The music in the film (depending on your taste) is very inspiring in some moments but very lacklustre in others.  I really wish it had a better soundtrack (like Jimmy Sommerville's work in ORLANDO) because i think it would have really set the film off.
I can honestly say I thoroughly enjoyed PARTS of the film but on whole it seemed a little too scattered and very confusing.  It was full of cuts to scenes that really didn't make much sense or had little relevance (they seemed to provide irrelevant, too little information or none at all) and made the film feel very unorganised.  But those few moments (like the very start when Shiro talks about his life and his passion for flying) really burn into your brain.

Well, they don't speak the same language in the subtitled version. In fact, its a made-up language. I also feel that the Japanese voices do a better job. Anyway, lets talk about the film.
The movie itself is viewed as a different civilization that mankind could have created. Money exist as little sticks, books are read vertically, TVs are black and white and the time is made up of 'maals'. It tells the story of Shiro who voluneteers for the next person to be shot in to space. Currently, the Space Force hasn't sent anyone into space succussefully, but this time, its going to work. Shiro also meets a young lady who is very religous. Yeah yeah. Your thinking they're a love couple, right? Wrong. This story tells the tale about a man who fails at love, but still lives on. The most impressive scenes are when Shiro plays a game at a bar with his buddies, when Shiro tests out an airplane and when the shuttle gets ready to take off while the enemy fights only a few miles a way.

660830,4,6303481264,"""Wings of Honneamise"" juxtaposes personal motives, personal motives as recorded for posterity, and personal motives as seen by the public. Case in point: Shiro Lhadatt, a chronic slacker serving in the pointless, oft-ridiculed Space Force of the tiny kingdom of Honneamise. Inspired by the teachings of a humble young woman (he instantly falls in love with her, only to realize that her kindness shapes in him in unforeseen ways), he jumps at the chance to be the world's first cosmonaut, even though due to mechanical errors and reduced government funding, all previous missions were outrageous failures.
The viewer is likely to be captivated by the artful, imaginative parallel world of ""Wings of Honneamise"". ""Art Noveau"" fits the feel very well. This is a world of fluted architecture and double-decker streetcars, narrow alleys flanked by worn stone walls, and flickering sepia televisions.
The film takes a variety of approaches to achieve the full impact: there are humorous scenes (the ""engineers"" designing the so-called ""warship"" are bowling-ball headed old men, whole lives' dream was to design this spaceship), thought-provoking scenes (it is suggested that were the funding for the program cut, the government could issue relief for the poor and the unemployed), thrilling scenes of suspense (the attempted assassination), love scenes (Shiro's hapless romance with kind, humble Riqunni), scenes of triumph against all odds (when the launch is approved despite the war that erupts over the rocket), etc.

Like when you see Shiro get interested with that girl, you might automatically think its a romance, but your wrong. After Shiro tries to seduce her, they break up, but as the story moves along, you'll see that shades of the girl grows on Shiro. The movie is mostly about religion, flight and life. And the last couple of minutes in the movie feature brilliant music set against stunning pictures of artwork. It is a brilliant movie and the dub was very well done. The music was a little questionable, but its not horrible for a movie made in 1987.

Aside from viewing the movie in 5.1 English or 2.0 Japanese, there is also commentary with the directors in Japanese with English subtitles. Seeing the commentary really helped me understand certain scenes like with Shiro and that girl. The DVD aslo contains a promotional short for the film (which is kinda like a promo for Space Oddessy), a deleted scene (which is just a scene where Shiro and a friend of his sit together on a car talking) and a musical conceptual art video. Theres also Manga previews, blah, blah. One of the neat things about this DVD is that inside the case is a little reading on the directors and how the movie was made. Can you believe it took 800 million yen to make the movie? And I couldn't believe it took over 3000 artists to help animate it. The only down fall is that this 2 hour movie only has 10 chapter stops. Even Princess Mononoke had more than that. But still, Honneamise is a great film. I'd recommend it for adults and teens since there are some mature themes in it. A must-have for any anime fan or anyone who likes films. I'll close by quoting Roger Ebert's statement on the film.

The film suggests that we could have had manned space flight before jet engines in planes. All of these intricate details make this a wonderful world to watch by itself but with the story intertwined with all of this eyecandy you can't help but love this film.
  The story is not the greatest product I have ever seen in my life, but it is uses a decent character to use as a vehicle throught the film. The main character is someone who you can empathize with.

I'll just say this, this movie I would watch through a telescope at 3 miles with no audio what so ever, except the music.

Amid the rag tag band of scientists and soldiers is an underlying intrigue of political and national underhandedness, plotting counter to the welfare of the RSF and their country.

660932,5,6303481264,"Honneamise is an excellent film with powerful characters and an intriguing world.  To dismiss this as a cartoon is to entirely miss the point.  The meticulously detailed world (down to its unique toothbrush design) could not be readily crafted in live action.  The story recounts the efforts of a nation in another world to launch the first manned spacecraft, and the personal journey of the pilot, Shiro Lhadatt, who dreamed of being a jet pilot but failed due to his grades, and ended up in the ridiculed Royal Space Force.  A chance encounter sets him, uneasily, on the path to space, whatever his nation's leaders' cynical plots and manipulations (or the low expectations his superiors have of him).  Perhaps the most important point about this film is that it doesn't try to explain itself: it tells its story and lets the viewer discern its meaning.  It is a film for adults to view and think about, and those are few and far between.  Above and beyond that, it is often breathtakingly beautiful.
Technically, this movie is outstanding.  The quality of the animation is superb.  The character designs are unusual and even if not attractive at first glance, endearing and expressive.  The voice acting of the English dub is outstanding; in particular, the voice of Shiro is more than capable of carrying the story (as the needs to be).  The music is unusual, but meshes perfectly with the unique vision of the world as drawn.  As an aside, there is a very brief shot of nudity late in the tale, but it is integral to the tale of Shiro.",973468800,9,1540,4.705223880597015

The comedy takes a back stage but is not completely nonexistant as there are quite a few moments that will make you chuckle.  Where this anime truly shines is the exquisite character development and design.  The characters seem truly real to the viewer.  It takes you in so that you actually care what happens to them.

660934,4,6303481264,"Honneamise was Gainax's first movie -- and could have very well been their last. At a cost of 8 billion Yen, this production was the most expensive  anime project at that time. The money spent of this movie really shows --  for this film's animation quality is something that is rarely seen, even  after some 12 years since its initial release.
Writer / director Yamaga  Hiroyuki has created an wonderfully complex and diverse world, very much  like our own, as his canvas for this ""what if"" fairy tale of a  world's first attempts to launch a man into space. His world is one which  has gone through the Earth equivalent of the Stone, Bronze and Iron ages,  faced its version of the Industrial revolution, and is now facing the  parallel of World War II. While aspects of the language and objects  depicted this film may be non-human, you find yourself strangely familiar  with everything -- almost as if you may have seen this world in a different  lifetime. The brilliance of this approach is that there are no distractions  by providing familiar, historical points of reference. Instead, the  philosophical themes are allowed to shine through the script, their  messages strangely resonating against the backdrops of a not-so alien  world.
Characterisations are very detached -- almost docu-drama in feel.  But this 'arms-length' protrayal of both Shiro and Leiquinni (the religious  devotee for whom Lhadatt falls) in no way diminishes their roles in the  movie. Like many other elements in this film, each character has their own  piece of history -- some things are hinted, others are explored in depth.  (Speaking of characters -- the characters designs are refreshingly  different from your typical anime fare. While they're not photorealistic,  they do have facial features not normally seen in a Japanese production.  Leiquinni, for example, has a real nose!) Music, composed by renowned  artist Sakamoto Ryuichi, is one area that I found rather disappointing.  While the soundtrack helps move the show along, it seemed uninspired --  somewhat repetetive, and included as almost an afterthought. The animation  is where this production really shines. It's not particularily notable in  frame rates, but it is richly detailed, and even more importantly,  exceptionally well composed. Animation director Hideaki Anno utilizes  dramatic angles and strong backgrounds to provide a richly illustrated  world in turmoil. (Several scenes were obviously modelled after popular  science-fiction movies). There are some instances where the frame  composition seemed strangely out-of-place -- most notably during the final  battle scene, with enemy ground forces advancing on the launch site. The  direct close-ups of the infantrymen didn't portray the same level of  dimension and depth as the rest of the movie. While this is a minor item,  it does illustrate an interesting facet of filmmaking: if movies scenes are  composed exceptionally well, the mere presence of any sub-standard scene  will appear blatantly ordinary in comparison.
And the animation itself?  Breathtaking. The final scenes are simply a joy to watch. Aircraft behave  like real aircraft. Explosions scatter shrapnel. And then there's the  launch itself. Painstakingly rendered with assistance from NASA's film  archives. The efforts of the animators are most rewarding to the  viewers.
Surprisingly, the English dubbed version is acceptable -- the  actors sound bored, but otherwise, they're inoffensive. And give credit to  the folks at Manga Entertainment. They didn't even try to re-work the Royal  Space Force Anthem, which is a mixed blessing. It's not a great piece to  begin with; but by not doing anything with it, they didn't make things  worse. The major draw-back with the dub: the final dialog by Shiro is  already a fairly trite and preachy speech. The strained English voice-over  version is even more so.
In the end, the real star of this production is  the story itself. It's ambitious to a fault, plods uncomfortably slow at  times, and ends on a weak editorialising note, but I found that this in no  way diminishes this film's intent. Technology may grow, but if human nature  does not grow with it, we are destined to be no better than the wielders of  stone knives and bear-skin clothing.

In this film, we see a society in what  might compare to the 1950's of our era at the brink of space flight, with a  brewing war drawn up by politicians which is riding on a single space  flight.

The plot  itself seems to be a wish fulfillment for Japan to be the very first nation  to reach the outer space even though the real-life astronauts are already  riding off in space shuttles by the time this film is made. And what is  more, the sweet-faced Shiro could have been a well-celebrated and  much-loved hero, yet...(POSSIBLE SPOILER) he just went and poured all of  his virtue down the drain when he brutally forced himself onto the timid  young nun in a country house.

This really is an anime for an intellegent crowd so it  should turn off some viewers, guess what, I'm not one of them! Grave of the  Fireflies is the only title better in the anime spectrum that I can think  of although honorable mention goes to Akira but Akira is more genre centric  than Wings. Wings has an appeal that transends genres and target  demographics and tells a gripping story about life. The characters are very  well rounded and believable. The pacing is actually a strongpoint in the  film as nothing ever seems out of place as the theme slowly progresses  without ever skipping a beat. For those that have the patience, this is a  deep and rewarding experience. For everyone else, go watch whatever, I  don't care because you're not who this review is for. Oh yeah, for a film  that came out in 87 the production values are superb. Although this was the  highest budgeted anime ever at this point.

I believe there was only one good action scene in the film in  which an assassin chases the main character through the city.  Other than  that, the movie was, without a doubt, made for the Animae fans that enjoy  more artistic movies than action movies.

A gripping story, thoroughly believeable characters, staggeringly powerful animation  (check out the launch sequence!) make this film stand shoulder to shoulder  with some of the best SF ever made.  A true example of what can be achieved  with animation besides just doing song-and-dance routines or busty babes or  foul-mouthed kids.  Will everyone like it?  Of course not.  But if you like  animation, anime, or are complaining about the lack of good science fiction  out there, do yourself a favor--quit griping and check this movie out.",948672000,5,677,5.3428571428571425

I wouldn't mind having this play with like some chill music or something, but for real, the movie is about going to space and like the whole movie I was just waiting around for the wings of mayonnaise to take off. Also, what was up with the rape stuff? I was cringing in some scenes.",1507766400,,370,4.225352112676056
