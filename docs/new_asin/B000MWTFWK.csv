8494762,5,B000MWTFWK,"This program is a favorite of mine! It covers the F-22, F-35, JDAM munitions, laser weapons, electro-magnetic pulse weapons, stealth technology and UAVs like the Pegasus for the Navy. It is about 50 minutes long and has excellant footage and graphics. The interviews with the experts and pilots are very informative. One of the programs has been cancelled, the Comanche helicopter, but it documents that aircraft's development very well. This program would appeal to the aviation enthusiast who wants to learn more about stealth technology,fighters and military aviation technology. It even has a segment on hypersonic aircraft.",1371859200,,628,5.484536082474227
