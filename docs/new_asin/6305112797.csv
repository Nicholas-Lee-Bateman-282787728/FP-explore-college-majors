7884572,5,6305112797,"Excellent action movie. The acting was quality, and the action was well done. Very impressed. I don't know why I didn't see this before. This is a keeper in the video collection! All the elements were there. The protagonist was excellent with good martial arts scenes. Shatner did well, and can still take a punch like a champ. The soundtrack was horrid. Whoever did the music for this film should be taken out back and flogged. Did the producer run out of money, or something? If you can get past the soundtrack, you'll love this film.",1505865600,,536,4.59375

7884574,3,6305112797,"Putting Jeff Speakman into a movie with William Shatner (or vice-versa) is just about as random of a combination as any, and I'm sorry to say that it doesn't make for a particularly noteworthy movie. Nearing the end of his career as a solo star, Speakman does what's expected of him (though not necessarily all of what's wanted), while Shatner seems to have dropped into the film on a whim and looks puffy and wooly-haired. Together, they make a very generic action film with a political backdrop, fun enough to watch on a slow night, but far from the standout vehicle for either of them.

The story: when the campaign manager (Speakman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Perfect-Weapon/dp/B006A8XFUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Perfect Weapon</a>) of an aspiring senator (Shatner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B001DHXT6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>) discovers that his boss is connected to a militia plotting the overthrow of the government, both he and his family are put in mortal danger.

Story-wise, the film is an exercise in ambiguity. I don't think it's ever revealed why Shatner's character and his militia hate the government, nor how they intend to overthrow it. It's also never hinted at why a political campaign manager just happens to be a martial arts expert and capable of such feats as stunt driving and home infiltration. (SPOILER) And why does a supposedly good FBI agent suddenly become a turncoat at precisely the right time? - I have no idea. I think the filmmakers figured that since such information is generally facetious in an action movie to begin with, why even waste a minute on exposition? This doesn't necessarily hurt the film, but it does make it surrender any credibility it had in being anything but a ""dumb action movie.""

As such, there really is no political intrigue, here. The viewer will know within the first five minutes that there's something extremely fishy about the aspiring Senator Shatner, and it's not long thereafter that the whole plot is dropped into one's lap and the vast majority of the film is simply a matter of Speakman and his family attempting to evade assassination. Luckily, this is a pretty action-packed hunt, supplying a good amount of 90s-style adrenaline scenes. The filmmakers appear to really have had a thing for vehicle stunts, because I lost count of all of the impressive car crashes. There's even a scene wherein a truck drives *through* a school bus, ripping it in half. Sadly, the kind of action that everybody wants from Jeff Speakman - awesome karate fight scenes - remains as insubstantial as it was in his last half-dozen movies: there are nine hand-to-hand fights, but only two of these exceed ten seconds in length and only one of the longer ones is what I'd call a good brawl.

William Shatner's inclusion is a mixed thing. Most of the time, he's playing a politician in front of media cameras and comes across as wooden and ingenuine as any legitimate one, but then he has some scenes as an unabashed, slimy villain and he's very effective. He even gets in on the action near the end of the picture, involving himself in a helicopter scene and even getting into a quick tussle with Speakman. Nevertheless, I think his role could have been played just as well by other performers, and therefore, the movie isn't a must-have for his fans. Speakman fans will have more fun with it, provided they don't expect too much kenpo. In all, this one's a better movie than its obscurity would suggest, though its audience is fairly niche: low-budget action lovers only.",1407801600,,3662,5.180743243243243

7884576,1,6305112797,"Jeff Speakman is a fantastic martial artist ..... but this movie, like all his movies since The Perfect Weapon, is horrible ..... machine guns, car wrecks, bad dialogue and plot - and the video of Jeff's American Kenpo techniques is wasted by bad angles and no filming imagination .... I'd like to see Jeff Speakman in a movie made by Jet Li or Jackie Chan's crew, or by the crew from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ..... I'll wait .... don't waste your time with this bomb ... 1 star is a gift",1226016000,2,494,4.380434782608695
7884577,4,6305112797,"William Shatner has never been called a great actor.  True, he guided STAR TREK into immortality, but that was mainly because of the series itself, with Shatner's Captain Kirk becoming more of a caricature to be revered as opposed as an acting conquest.  In this entertaining, if improbable, movie, Shatner plays Aiden Carvell, an advertising executive, who is on his way to becoming a state senator.  Jeff Speakman plays his campaign manager who discovers that Senator Carvell is up to some sneaky, anti-government activities, like funding a militia group that would take over America!  Speakman's martial arts training enables him to become a veritable superman in his quest to take Shatner down.  Lisa Darr is his supportive wife who gets caught up in the mayhem; Chris Lemmon has a small role as an FBI agent supervising witness protection for Speakman and his family.  There are lots of car chases, bullets flying and an almost humorous climax between Shatner and Speakman.  Speakman is a martial arts Shatner; not a great actor but a commanding presence nonetheless.

You could do a lot worse on a rainy October night.",1097625600,6,1124,5.005376344086022
