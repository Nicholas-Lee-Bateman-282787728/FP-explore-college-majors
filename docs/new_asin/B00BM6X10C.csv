8570696,3,B00BM6X10C,"Dramatic movie of the tragic real-life abduction of ten-year-old Natascha Kampusch who was taken from her way to school in 1998 and kept in a dungeon for eight years. Real-life kidnapper Wolfgang Priklopil was excellently if sadistically played by Thure Lindhardt in what surely must have been a difficult role. Difficult too was the part given to Amelia Pidgeon who played young Natascha, for she had to endure the initial fiendish setting in the dungeon.  Hard to view for the audience is the skeleton-thin body of actress Antonia Campbell-Hughes who had to lose practically all her weight to play the part of teen Natascha, and who had to endure the physical and sexual abuse by her tormentor.  I cannot recommend viewing this movie because we viewers have to suffer all the indignities and abuse thrown at poor Natascha---it is a movie that is painful to watch.  However, looked at as a documentary we learn to appreciate the true hell that Natascha---and the many thousands of girls and women who are kidnapped around the world---lived through.  3096 Days is not a movie with a dynamic plot that moves forward with every passing minute, but rather a milieu movie where the setting and everyday life in the dungeon and the floor above provide the primary focus. On the other hand I also see this movie as a testament to the courage of real-life Natascha who wrote about her experiences in hell. Because of this I can say that viewing it was a worthwhile experience, and perhaps even a duty. Knowing about her story we more fully come to know about the vileness within the human race.",1391904000,13,1587,4.781021897810219
