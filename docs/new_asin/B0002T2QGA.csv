2118426,5,B0002T2QGA,"The DVDs come to an end with this final volume. For those who haven't gotten their hands on the unaired episodes, you're in for a major treat. Here are the episodes on this volume.

GIR Goes Crazy and Stuff / Dib's Wonderful Life of Doom

TAK the Hideous New Girl

The Most Horrible Xmas Ever

Mortos der Soulstealer / ZIM Eats Waffles

The Frycook What Came From All that Space

But first, here's a little backstory. ZIM was on the verge of being cancelled by the time the second season was started. The first season ended with TAK, and the first seven episodes of season two were already being animated. Then Nick pulled the plug on the show. But not after one last episode Jhonen proposed to do to end the series with a bang. So, 'The Most Horrible Xmas Ever,' which was scheduled to be made near the end of season two, was pushed up and made, thus explaining Minimoose's unusual appearence. Minimoose did have an introduction, but it was never completed. So 'Xmas' aired, and the remaining six completed episodes were shown around the world, but not here in the US. And now, we can finally see them. WATCH Dib conjure up the ancient being Mortos der Soulstealer! MARVEL at the horrible pig girl that is Gaz! GASP at ZIM eating waffles for eleven whole minutes!

There will be commentary for almost all episodes, and also the animatics of course. But I hope they include some of the artwork, scripts, and other things they had completed for the incomplete season two episodes. There were at least ten that were at least laid out. Four episodes even got recorded: ""Return of Keef,"" where Keef makes a triumphant return, ""Mopiness of Doom,"" where Dib tries to do REAL science, ""Simon Says Doom,"" where ZIM babysits kids, and ""Nubs of Doom,"" Minimoose's premier episode. But, these are just things I hope are on the DVD. I didn't want to get anyone's hopes up if they're not.",1092960000,122,2015,4.584958217270195

2118429,5,B0002T2QGA,"In the far reaches of space, the Irken Empire moves ever closer to universal domination. Unbeknowest to the Irkens, however, important battles are occuring on Earth between child paranormalist Dib, and ZIM, an annoying, stubborn Irken Invader (Invaders are those who infiltrate planets and find out how to take over it). As the series moves closer to it's end, the almost-Irken Invader TAK comes into play, and the Empire begins the most deciding battles of all: crush the resistance or be crushed.

Unfortunately, ZIM was cancelled before it reached the two part Season 2 finale, which would have set up the next phase in the show's storyline. However, you can watch the series progress throughout the 3 volumes (this being the last) and discover the story arc that seemed to only become clear in Season 2.

From mastermind Jhonen Vasquez (comics ""Johnny the Homicidal Maniac,"" ""I Feel Sick,"" ""Squee!"") and director Steve Ressel (tv shows ""Rocko's Modern Life,"" ""Stressed Eric,"" ""God, the Devil, and Bob"") comes Invader ZIM, the show that Nickelodeon just couldn't handle.

On these discs, you'll find the completely uncut version of ""The Most Horrible Xmas Ever,"" the infamous Christmas special, ""TAK: The Hideous New Girl,"" which introduced TAK, Fan favorites ""Backseat Drivers From Beyond the Stars"" and ""The Frycook What Came From All That Space,"" the zany ""ZIM Eats Waffles,"" ""Gaz, Taster of Pork""- the episode that got ZIM cancelled, and more.

Hurry and grab yourself one of the finest animated series ever made today!",1091836800,13,1526,5.116465863453815

2118449,5,B0002T2QGA,"""Invader Zim"" is an awesome cartoon. I won't be surprised if it's already reached some kind of ""classic"" or ""cult"" status. I watched this when I was a little girl, circa 2001 (I was about eight or nine when it first aired) and I still watch it. I find it very disappointing that Nickelodeon cancelled the series over a little blood being shown. Like that's the worst this show has done. Wow. We've seen Zim crawl through guts, seen some characters get turned inside out and even seen some other grotesque images at his school on earth involving even puke... And it gets cancelled over a little tiny splotch of blood. But whatever, the show is amazing. The art style, as you can already see from the icon, is highly quirky, but paired with the amazing writing it all comes together nicely.

Zim is a young Irken invader who is deployed to Earth by the Tallests, his leaders who could care less about him, with an adorable little robot named Gir, who is actually just an empty shell. Literally. His head is empty aside from some trash. Zim makes his base in a rather filthy looking city, disguises it as a ""normal"" earth home, complete with a flag out in the yard that says ""I <3 Earth"". But, seeing the general heights of the grown adults, he realizes he must masquerade as an Earth child and enroll in school. Phase one of his plot to destroy Earth is nearing completion when a boy in his class, a paranormal fanatic named Dib, soon realizes that no normal kid has green skin... Hilarity ensues in most episodes where Zim and Dib attempt to annihilate each other, most often coming from Gir, who can't resist piggies, cupcakes, cutesy kids shows, waffles or tacos, even when pretending to be Zim's little green pet dog. He also loves babies and dancing... He has a long list of things he likes that cause him to go hyperactive.

My only warning: the show is graphic and might not be suitable for those who don't have strong stomachs. But it is highly worth a watch for some great belly-laughs!",1430870400,,1993,4.518005540166205

Oh, did I mention there is a robot in a dog suit.... with a zipper? Yep. Amazing!
This cartoon has a completely legit cult status now and will forever live in the hearts of club kids and goths alike, but truly this is a fantastic achievement. It's utterly original, hilariously written, and is absolutely enjoyable across genders and age gaps.
So often what amuses kids is utterly torturous for adults, but this is not the case here. This is really enjoyable and I actually think I might enjoy it a bit more than my kids, but don't tell them!
At times the series can verge on the completely bizarre, but as a whole it's a wonderful show that you should experience at least a small bit of. I can almost guarantee you'll be hooked and will be humming the doomy techno theme song in no time!",1361404800,,1040,4.450261780104712

2118550,4,B0002T2QGA,"Invader Zim is a dark, disturbing cartoon that looks like someone made it that was insane (but in a good way). The basis of the story is that an alien, Zim, from planet Irk is sent to a mysterious planet on what he thinks is a mission to conquer it. His leaders, The Almighty Tallest, only sent him away to be rid of him for a while. Zim and his robot servant, GIR, just so happen to land on Earth. Sadly, Zim is unequipped to handle the challenges that await him on Earth. To make matters worse for Zim, a child with a huge head named Dib sets out to stop Zim at all costs.

All of the episodes are full of laughs and ridiculous screaming. GIR is the funniest character due to his complete randomness and idiotic nature. Some episodes are more based on Dib or Gaz, Dib's Sister, than on Zim, but they are still very well done. This DVD set features episodes 19-27.

My only complaint with this Season is that the episode they used to close out the series, The Most Horrible X-mas Ever, was completely stupid. It introduced a new character named Mini-Moose for no reason at all. The episode itself isn't funny at all compared to other episodes in this box set. Invader Zim went out with a whimper and no closure whatsoever.

I can get the DVD to work in only one player.  This happened with the other Zim DVD I bought.  This does not happen with any other DVDs.

2118557,5,B0002T2QGA,"When a group of my friends asked me to sit down a watch the entire series of a show called Invader Zim in one sitting, my first reaction was...Invader who?  Yes, up until recently, I was one of the unfortunate few who had not seen this series.  Well, after sitting through all three volumes of the show my immediate reaction was...That's it?!  There's no more?!  I must have more Zim!  Ziiiiiiimmmmm!

First off, let me say that my review for this volume of the series will actually be for the entire series.  Also, because my friend had to take his DVD's back (sigh) I did not have time to go through all the special features and commentaries.  However, I chose this volume in particular because it contained my favourite episode (more on that later).  The basic premise of the show (for those that don't already know) is that a race of aliens called the Irkens are planning a conquest of the galaxy, codenamed: Impending Doom II.  The conquest is spearheaded by a group of Irkens called ""Invaders"", who are sent to various planets to lay the groundwork for invasion.  Zim (who screwed up Impending Doom I) is one such Invader.  However, to prevent his interference with Impending Doom II he is sent off to a planet at the edge of the galaxy (i.e. Earth), and is accompanied by a broken, and slightly insane robot named GIR.  On Earth, Zim attempts to discover our planet's weaknesses while trying to blend in with Earth society.  The only one who actually knows Zim is an alien is a boy at the school Zim attends named Dib, who seems to model himself around Fox Mulder from the X-Files.  Dib attempts to stop Zim's plan at every turn, while at the same type trying to convince everyone around him that Zim is an alien.

This show is just all around insane craziness.  Nearly every episode of this series is gut-splittingly hilarious.  I remember one episode early on in the series where Zim steals his classmates' organs in order to make himself appear more human to a school nurse, but in the end becomes incredibly fat from taking too many organs.  There is another episode where Zim tricks Dib into thinking he has become this all powerful hero.  So powerful in fact, that he destroys the Irken mothership, and when that ship crash landed onto Earth it created a huge sandstorm that threatened many civilians, but Dib just roundhouse kicks it away! It was freaking great!  Another episode had Dib's sister, Gaz, hunt down a boy who took the last of the new Game Slave 2 consoles, and tortures him by not letting him finish his game.  Moral of the story, don't piss Gaz off.

But, by far my personal favourite episode of this series would have to be the Christmas episode in volume 3.  This episode had Zim attempting to take over the world by disguising himself as Santa.  It also introduced Minimoose (""Yup, him with me the whole time!""), it had a great fight scene between Dib in a giant robot suit and a colossal, out of control Santa suit, and it has one of the greatest Christmas carols of all time.  You know what, since this is Christmas time right now, I'm going to buy this series, force all my friends and family to sit down and watch this Christmas episode, and make everyone sing, ""Bow down!  Bow down!  Before the power of Santa!""

Frankly, it's a crime that this show was pulled off the air.  I remember hearing my friends tell me that Nickelodeon put this show in a pretty crappy timeslot, and wrongly marketed the show towards young children.  It's a shame though, because given the proper treatment by TV execs, this show could have easily become the next Simpsons, Family Guy, or South Park.  If you are reading this review, chances are you have already seen the greatness of this series.  If you haven't, then you MUST check this show out!  Zim commands you!",1134950400,4,3782,4.562314540059347
2118558,5,B0002T2QGA,"Invader Zim is one of the most strangest, awesomest shows I have ever seen in my life. It rocks.

The Girl Who Cried Gnome 4/5

The Most Horrible X-Mas Ever 5/5

Told 2 million years in the future, by a machanicle snowman. Zim tries to take over the world by becoming Santa.

Over all, I'd give it 5/5 stars. Zim is an awesome show, and you really should watch it. Especially if you enjoy insane cartoons.",1134000000,2,2725,4.228682170542636
2118559,5,B0002T2QGA,"Okay, let's get down to it.  This rocks.  I'm not going to tell you about the backstory with Nick and Jhonen, that's whart everyone else is for.  Okay, basically, there's this little alien named Zim.  He's from a mighty race on the verge of Universal conquest.  Unfortunately, rank, in his society, is judged by hight, and Zim is almost as short as they come.  Well, after alomost destroying his home planet, the Almighty Tallests sent Zim to the far reaches of the galaxy with a peice of crap robot assistant and an pout-of-date spacecraft.  this might seem the tragic beginning of a series, but it's not.  Zim finds Earth (go figure) and begins making pathically carzy plans for conquest.  However, there is a kid named Dib who recognises Zim as an alien and vows to protect earth.  that's basically all you need to know.  The first two volumes explain it more, and have loads of funny episodes, but the third volume is, by far, the best.  I saw one episode from this volume and imediately ran out and bought the whole series.  It's worth it.  You could do it in order, but what I told you is really all you need to know to understand what's happening.  I lent the DVDs to some of my friends and they all became obsessive zombie-types after the firts episode.  So yes, if you like twisted humor, you'll like this.  Now hurry up and buy the demn thing!",1131321600,,1353,4.479508196721311
2118560,5,B0002T2QGA,"Most likely, if you are reading this you either a) watched Invader Zim on TV long ago and you are intersted in watching the many unaired episodes, b) you bought the other two volumes and are wondering whether to buy the last one, or c) you have no idea what Invader Zim is and stumbled upon this item on accident.

If you are an A or a B, I would suggest buying this DVD immediately.  This volume contains some of the best Invader Zim episodes; ""Zim Eats Waffles,"" and ""Girl Who Cried Gnome,"" both of which show off Jhonen Vasquez's incredible talent at taking boring things (such eating waffles) and craft them into hilarious pieces of entertainment by adding genetically-enhanced demon squids and cybernetic zombie soldiers.  Also, episodes such as ""Backseat Drives From Beyond the Stars,"" and ""Gaz, Taster of Pork,"" really shows off his wild imagination that Jhonen's fans have come to love and expect.

This may seem like duh-duh advice, but anyone who is a C (that is, doesn't know what Invader Zim is), should check out Volume 1: Doom, Doom, Doom, or the Invader Zim minidisc, which contains the first episode, before buying Volume 3.  And if you haven't seen Zim before, I would highly suggest it.  From my experience, people either love or hate this show, but it's definately worth the risk.",1129420800,,1299,4.725663716814159
2118561,4,B0002T2QGA,"It's easy to see why Nickelodeon cancelled the series if these were the ones produced for airing during the next season.  That's not meant to be a harsh statement but it is obvious that these episodes were geared more to adult fans.

It has some hilarious moments especially each time Zim screams or laughs maniacally.  The animation remains stylish, the stories are still delightfully decadent, and there are plenty of quirky drop-ins.  My favorites tended to be all the food-related ones: ""Zim Eats Waffles,"" ""Gaz, Taster of Pork,"" and ""The Frycook What Came From All That Space.""",1123977600,2,582,4.969072164948454

2118573,5,B0002T2QGA,"So it comes to this the end of a short-lived masterpiece. Well Mr. Vasquez surly saved the best for last. This final volume of Invader Zim is by far the zaniest and most brilliant out of the entire series. This piece really fills up all the gaps in the Invader Zim story line. We are introduced to the vile Irken female invader named Tak. I am sure that Dib would have killed himself knowing he tried to get with an alien. The head of planet food courtia also tracks down Zim. And of course...I mean...nothing is more ingenious than an episode dedicated to Zim eating waffles! Nothing happens in that episode yet you just can't help but laugh at him just eating waffles! I heard that there were other episodes that were written, but never released. The true question is...what are the chances of a possible Invader Zim comeback? Knowing television programming these days probably slim to none. Zim however will remain in the hearts of all the fans along with all the memorable lines and characters that joined him on his quest to conquer Earth. Unfortunately for Zim...he will never find out if he ever did...but speaking as one of his true fans he sure as hell did. Johan Vasquez...thank you.",1117929600,3,1193,4.632075471698113

2118578,5,B0002T2QGA,"This is the third and final volume in the long-awaited Zim DVD set. It contains all 6 of the unaired season 2 episodes, which, aside from some grainy encodes sent to fan site servers from fans in Brazil, (as well as occasional screenings at conventions and the like) have never been seen by residents of the U.S. or Canada.

This final installment in the series finishes of the first season with the fan favorite ""Tak, the Hideous New Girl"" which started a whole new continuity which carried into the second season and, had the series continued, would have brought the series into more space-themed stories, where Dib and the Resisty would join forces to oppose the Irken Empire. Unfortunately, such a  turn of events never took place, but we did at least get to see a few great continuital episodes such as ""Backseat Drivers From Beyond the Stars"" and the highly sought after ""Frycook What Came From All That Space"", which was predecessor to a major but unfinished episode, ""The Trial.""

We also get a lot of irrelevant but funny episodes, features of which include Dib and his guidance counselor, a little girl who gets stranded in Zim's gnome field, and a curse that makes everything Gaz eats taste like pork.

The only major problem with this volume is the accidental inclusion of the edited-for-TV version of ""The Most Horrible Xmas Ever."" While Media Blasters is working to correct the problem, it's still disapointing that we don't yet get to see staff member Ian Graham crushed to death by an immense piece of machinery.

This is a must-buy for any Zim fan, of course, but fans of animation in general will enjoy the well orchestrated chase scenes and fancy CG effects used in a few of the major episodes. There's also some particularly great scores here from composer Kevin Manthei, whose interview is not included on this or any other volume, so we'll have to assume that it will be included on the ""extra disc"" packaged with the box set.

The advertised ""UNCUT XMAS EPISODE"" is not currently on this volume.  The Media Blasters people reported a ""BOO BOO"" on their part, and accidently put on the edited episode.  They intend to replace the mistake on future printings of this volume.  It was last reported that they HOPE to have this problem fixed by Late November of 2004 OR possibly sometime in December 2004.  So it might be best for those of you who do not have any of the volumes yet to wait until the ULTIMATE set is released (Hopefully) sometime in January 2005.  There are two things listed to be released in January 2005 for Invader Zim Box sets.  One is ""JUST THE BOX"" along with ONE extra DVD and a few other nicknacks (it does not include the 6 DVD's of the episodes, so don't be lured in by it's price).

Does anyone remember the (original British) Max Headroom in the '80s? After the pilot, they produced about 8 shows, and it was prematurelly cancelled. When they tried to bring it back, it totally lost the edge.

So the same thing with Zim. But at least Zim was just cancelled before Nick tried to sugar it up. I still find it amazing that Nick even aired the show. These are the kind of cartoons to which none other can stand against.

From the commentary, the people involved give the impression that a lot of the work was half-baked, and I shudder to think what would happen if the producers were give total creative freedom, rather than being dragged down by the masses.

In any event, Zim is a brilliant creation which was deemed unworthy by Nick for further production.

If you've not seen Zim, you need to seriously buy all three of these DVD's and have a blowout weekend just watching them. You'll find yourself a better person.",1098316800,8,1058,4.582010582010582
2118593,5,B0002T2QGA,"Firstly, Jen down there doesn't have all the facts straight. Yes, the uncut version of the Christmas episode was not on the disc, but it wasn't just some rumor spread by fanboys. It was actually supposed to be on the disc, and it's on the description on the back of the DVD box. However, because of a mixup at Media Blasters, they accidentally put the wrong episode on the disc. I hear they're trying to fix the problem.

Anyway, on to the DVD. This one was probably the best volume of the three. The unaired Season 2 episodes, along with my personal favorite episode The Frycook What Came From All That Space, are on the disc, as well as the Season 1 Finale and, of course, the Christmas episode. Unlike the previous 2 volumes, all the episodes on this volume have commentary on them. The commentary for this volume is probably the funniest out of the three as well. On the second disc there's the interview with the production crew, which interviews Bryan Konietzko, Jason Stiff, Chris Graham, Ian Graham, and Rayfield Angrum. Still no interview with Jhonen Vasquez, which is a disappointment.

Although Media Blasters made a mistake with the Christmas episode and there was no interview with Jhonen, this DVD volume still deserves 5 stars. Invader Zim is probably the funniest show in existance, and it shows on this volume.",1097971200,22,1327,4.7155172413793105
2118594,5,B0002T2QGA,"I just recently purchased ""Horrible Holiday Cheer"", the third volume of the cancelled Vasquez masterpiece ""Invader Zim"".  Aside from the lack of extras, the dvd is just as good as the previous volumes, except for a couple of things.

1. Volume 3 has the infamous Christmas episode, ""The Most Horrible X-mas Ever"" and 2. Volume 3 also has a number of unaired episodes.  That's right, episodes that never made it to the screen thanks to Nickelodeon's bogus advertising priorities.

There are nine full episodes on this disc (most of which have two separate sub-eps in them), and you'd be hard pressed to find it selling for more than $17 anywhere.  If you're into bizarre humor with a twisted sci-fi edge, there's honestly no better human worm baby to turn to than Zim.",1097539200,12,767,4.78030303030303

2118596,5,B0002T2QGA,"i love this show so much. i have the first two volumes and they just make me want to watch them more and more and more and more. i can't get enough of gir's crazy rantings or everyone casting dib off into disbelief as if he is crazy. hopefully they will have johnen vasquez finally doing an interview or commentary or something because he seems to be awefully camera shy. i wish they would really concider putting this series on another more probable channel that will put it on a slot that will give it ratings instead of prime time on nickalodeon.

i can't wait to see the christmas special. horrible holiday cheer, sounds like my holidays. why did they decide that this show was good for nickalodeon anyway? are they retarded? no need to answer because the answer was in the question. down with spongebob and up with zim. boot them freaking rugrats and give us gir. screw the fairly odd parents and hand us over dib. YEEEAAAAHHH!!!!!

oh yeah and don't forget kids, keep an eye out for those elusive characters from the Squee and Johnny the Homicidal Maniac comics that made their way onto dvd. if you don't know what i am talking about, look at the teacher and those really dumb aliens who were quite tall from vol 2.",1096761600,3,1221,4.4708520179372195

You might see a volume called Operation: Doom, but that is a best-of set, loaded with fan favorites, apparently.
After enjoying the first two volumes of IZ, you will probably love seeing some of the final episodes and specials from the groundbreaking series that introduced mixing CGI and hand-drawn animation techniques nigh seamlessly, combined with dark, edgy humor that still delights fans to this day.
