4961807,4,B00664AM34,"Hello Kitty is a great show for little kids to watch. Each episode strives to teach kids the importance of good ol' family values, such as table manners, being patient, etc., and/or tips for just growing up, such as how to get dressed by yourself, when to go potty, or how to answer the phone. This 47 minute DVD includes the following episodes:

1. I Can Share With Friends (Really focuses more on being patient, waiting your turn, etc.)
2. Saying I'm Sorry (Kitty learns to say ""I'm sorry"" when she's done something wrong.)
3. Let's Play Together (Learning to play together at the playground)
4. Eating Nicely (Practicing good table manners)
5. Going to the Bathroom (Kitty learns how to listen to her body and go when she needs to)
6. Replying Properly (Answering when someone calls to you; saying 'yes' instead of 'uh-huh')

Compared with Growing Up With Hello Kitty 1, this one has more of the ""weird, imaginary characters"" common to Japanese animation. For example, in the last episode on this disk, Kitty finds a ghost-like being in her room named Yeah-What, and whenever she answers someone improperly, he grows, but whenever she says ""yes"" properly, he shrinks. There's also talking silverware in the 4th episode, and a non-threatening version of the little angel and demon that sit on someone's shoulder in the first one. I also feel that Kitty is a bit more whiny and self-centered in this video than in the first one, but she always learns how to behave correctly by the end of the episode. I would recommend both Hello Kitty DVDs, but if you can only get one, I would probably recommend Hello Kitty 1 over this one.",1372377600,15,1628,4.688811188811189
4961808,5,B00664AM34,"We bought the first one while we were on vacation, not realizing that all the episodes are about ""how to be a good kid.""  We were delighted, and our kids loved it, so we nabbed the second one from Amazon.  Excellent ""teaching lessons"" DVD / series for kids.",1370390400,,257,4.333333333333333

4961811,3,B00664AM34,My daughter really likes this movie. I am also a fan of Hello Kitty but she whines way to much in these stories. The lessons are good but also can be a bit scary learn through fear type of stuff.,1360195200,3,195,3.9
4961812,5,B00664AM34,"I have both Volumes of Growning up with Hello Kitty. They teach good lessons for kids.

Here are the cons 1. There is excessive laughing and alot of siliness on behalf of the kitty character. It can be a annoying!!
  2. Some of the stories use guilt in order for kids to do the right thing. It doesn't bother me, but someone else might not like that.",1343865600,2,350,4.1940298507462686
4961813,5,B00664AM34,"We bought the set of these dvds for our two year old to try to help her learn manners, sharing, when to go potty, etc. It's even better than we had hoped! It's so perfect for her to learn all these wonderful behaviors, and see that her favorite sisters Kitty and Mimi are acting the proper way. All we have to do is remind her that Kitty does this or that, and she's in such a happy mood to do exactly what Kitty did! These little cartoons are great for any age children, and the children don't even realize they are learning!!",1334880000,6,527,4.176470588235294
4961814,5,B00664AM34,"My daughters, 5 and 4, really enjoy this DVD. It has feel-good stories that teach the way to act in situations. I love that it focuses on teaching good habits and not just cute stories. I also recommend ""Growing Up With Hello Kitty 1"".",1334534400,,235,4.363636363636363
4961815,4,B00664AM34,"Hello Kitty is a beloved character from Japan that has become more familiar to our children. She is not perfect, but willing to learn and wants to do the right thing. Children will enjoy how she tackles the challenges put before her. This is a six-episode DVD, each segment has Kitty and her sister Mimi in everyday situations, applying what they learn from their parents. Life skills are taught with gentleness and caring. A good illustration that children of this age need guidance, and suggests that this be originated by parents. In every situation, Momma and Poppa work together to teach children the proper way to handle each new lesson. I am impressed by the gentle way in which the parents approach Kitty's mistakes. They are patient and use kind words. Kitty can make mistakes in her safe and loving environment that allows her to learn and grow. The family seem to really enjoy each other and they work and play together. Kitty and her sister Mimi have a good relationship.

Here is what some of our youth critics had to say about this DVD: ""The movie is all about good lessons."" ""Hello Kitty and her sister learn some important life lessons and their parents help them."" ""I like Mimi's sweet voice and how she is so nice to her sister."" ""I enjoy watching very much. It has a cheerful feel to it. It wasn't bad at all and wasn't dark or scary. It shows you can solve a life problem easily if you give it a good try!""",1332115200,5,1426,4.505791505791506

8493714,5,B00664AM34,"Really cute show that we stumbled upon at our local library. My kids loved it so much we bought it. And what a great price!

It's s bit outdated (in the way they talk to each other, use the house telephone, etc), but the lessons seem to be really topical and my children (ages 3 and 4.5) really enjoy it. The song is also very catchy (but lyrically odd). The best Hello Kitty show you can find on here (in addition to Growing Up with Hello Kitty Vol. 1).",1416700800,,454,4.101123595505618
