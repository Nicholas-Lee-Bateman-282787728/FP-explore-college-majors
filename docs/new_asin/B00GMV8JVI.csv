6088860,4,B00GMV8JVI,"When I enjoy a movie that other reviewers dismiss, it makes me wonder if my judgment has gone askew.  (The same applies when I don't like a film that everybody else seems to revere.)

In this particular instance, Im referring to BAD COUNTRY (2014), released onto Blu-Ray by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment and out of favor in just about every review Ive read thus far.

Im not claiming that this picture, directed by Chris Brinker, doesnt have faults, but as a tense, brutal crime drama, BAD COUNTRY its quite entertaining.  Supposedly based on a true story, the basic plot of the movie has been a prototype of the genre for decades.  It deals with a career felon who wants to change his life and, to do so, he agrees to become an undercover informant and help take down a major criminal organization.  What makes this version of the story rather unique is that, rather  than the action being set in New York, Chicago or Los Angeles, it takes place, for the most part, in the seedier parts of otherwise colorful Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Matt Dillon stars as a former hit man for crime kingpin Tom Berenger, who is arrested on a series of burglary charges and because of his past record, faces life in prison.  Wishing to start a new life with wife Amy Smart and his new baby son, Dillon makes a deal with cop Willem Dafoe to help him get Berenger, whose nefarious activities also are of interest to Federal authorities.

The cast, which also includes Neal McDonough and Bill Duke, is first-rate, delivering compelling performances all around.  The script contains a fair amount of unexpected turns, and the gritty action sequences are well staged.  Overall, BAD COUNTRY is a pretty good picture, yet it certainly could have been better.

At 95 minutes running time, several story elements in the movie remain sketchy.  Without overstaying its welcome, the screenplay could have included a bit more character development and, most importantly, more explanation as to the relationship between the various law enforcements agencies involved in the criminal investigation, as what is transpiring between them on screen is not always clear.  I also felt that, as well staged as it was, the final shootout and confrontation between Dillon and Berenger goes on a bit too long.

Extras on the Blu-Ray disc include deleted scenes and a Behind the Scenes featurette.

6088861,3,B00GMV8JVI,"Set in Baton Rouge in 1983 this is based on a true story. Detective Bud Carter played with veteran zeal by, possibly the most reliable character actor in America, Willem Dafoe realises he is on to something big when a chance undercover operation leads to him being given the name of someone higher up the crime food chain. This is Matt Dillon playing white supremacist and life choice criminal, Jesse Weiland .

He is at first a hard nut to crack but the ineptness of his underworld cronies soon leaves him with little option but to turn informant. That is when the whole thing starts moving inexorably towards the demise of one side or the other.

This is a really well made film production wise with strong performances and convincing conviction from all the players most notably the two leads and Tom Berringer who owns nigh on every scene he is in. There are a couple of plot holes and incidents of what has to be called `poetic licence' but this is `based on' a true story and as my Granddad used to say `you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story and by jingo the makers have taken that to heart.  There is a fair amount of action, plenty of earthy language and enough plot to keep you hooked right from the very start, so long as you can suspend belief a few times - easily recommended for some `not to be taken seriously' viewing.",1397347200,21,1357,4.376984126984127
6088862,5,B00GMV8JVI,"If you are sick of seeing the same old movies, this is a MUST see. Bad Country is based on a true story and will keep you entertained!! Matt Dillon and Willem Dafoe do a great job acting. Well written, great story line, good actors!",1395964800,,232,4.177777777777778
6088863,3,B00GMV8JVI,"""I didn't turn because I'm scared. I done what I did because certain people crossed the line."" Jesse Weiland (Dillon) is a contract killer in Louisana in the early 80's. Facing life in jail and never seeing his family again he makes a deal with Detective Bud Carter (Dafoe) to become an informant. When the FBI takes over things turn south for both Carter and Weiland. When his ex-boss goes too far Jesse has only one thing on his mind...revenge. I knew nothing about this movie going in and was looking forward to it because of the cast. The fact that it is based on a true story helps too. This is however yet another movie that has a great cast but isn't a great movie. I had a hard time getting into it and really caring about the characters. They all did a great job in it but there was just something missing. I can't tell you what it was but there was an element or two missing to really make me fully enjoy the movie. When you watch it maybe you can let me know what it was. Overall, great acting but not a great movie. Seems to be happening a lot lately. I give this a C+.",1395446400,,1081,4.152380952380953
6088864,3,B00GMV8JVI,"The film is based on a true story in 1983 Louisiana. It tells you what happens in the opening read. From a lone snitch, a crime empire is taken down. Bud Carter (Willem Dafoe) is the local detective who has discovered the operation. With the ineffective help of the government and inside man Jesse (Matt Dillon), Carter struggles to do his job.

Being based on a true story hampers some of the drama. There were plenty of shoot'em up scenes. I thought Dafoe and Dillon did great jobs in their roles, but somehow the local flavor of Louisiana didn't come through. The sound track needed to be taken to another level. We needed to see more of the crimes action. It is listed as a gritty crime action thriller. It meets the requirements of the description, yet most of the individual scenes looked made for TV.

Will make on okay rental. No need to rush out and see it.

Parental Guidance: F-bomb. Brief nudity (Gayle James?)",1394841600,4,922,4.542168674698795
6088865,3,B00GMV8JVI,"Let me just start by saying that I think both Willem Dafoe and Matt Dillon are very underrated actors.  That being said, I was pretty excited to check this movie out since both are included.  I REALLY wanted to love this movie and honestly went into it with the intention of recommending it to everyone.  However, after finishing it, I just can't do that.  The major problem with this film is the timing.  I was well over half way through before the synopsis even began to play out.  Once it finally did become the movie I was hoping it to be, it was over.  They took FAR too much time building a backstory for the characters and once that was done, it was almost if they realized, ""Woah...we need to wrap this thing up!""  It was mostly 1:15 story telling, 15 minutes action.  Now for some movies that's perfectly fine, but going into this thinking it's a ACTION/SHOOT-EM-UP, it completely let me down.

The movie follows Detective Bud Carter (Willem Dafoe) and his investigation into contract assassin, Jesse Weiland (Matt Dillion).  Without ruining anything (this is actually in the synopsis), Detective Carter eventually catches Jesse and turns him into a ""rat"" with the intentions of bringing down a massive crime syndicate.  Once the the organization discovers Jesse's betrayal, they off his family and Jesse seeks his revenge.  Sounds awesome, doesn't it?!  I thought so too!  Problem is, by the time Jesse's family is gone, there is only around 15 minutes of the movie left?  That killed it for me.  I was really amped up on watching a ""Death Sentence"" type movie, but sadly, that isn't what I got.

Don't get me wrong, this film isn't a complete waste or loss.  For the most part it does keep you interested, but I just felt that there was so much more that could've been done to bring it up to the level that it should have been.  I can see myself watching it on cable TV at home on the weekend, but other than that.....

Final Verdict:  PASS on this one.

6089277,3,B00GMV8JVI,"What a lifeless movie. I am not sure why, so I will blame the director. The actors walk through their lines and their accents are HORRIBLE. Berringer is the worst, switching from Irish to Brooklyn to standard California style...good lord! It's nothing to do with watching it, or enduring the dialogue, or being so vacuous we just cannot understand it; it's just a really dead movie. They even do a quick homage to Platoon, where Beringer has a push dagger like he did when he and Dafoe were in that movie. So many missed opportunities here it's just sad.
Watchable, but you will see what it wanted to be, but couldn't.",1429488000,2,618,4.576576576576577

6089284,4,B00GMV8JVI,"This movie is definitely better than a 5.5 - probably as good as a 7 at times.  Had potential to be a really terrific movie - the director missed the mark.  Good acting by Dafoe and Dillon, I especially liked Dafoe who I felt was immersed in his role so well I forgot it was him. He brought realness to that gritty detective he was playing.  There is a good story line, predictable but an interesting night at the movies.  I feel Dillon did well but I do not think his character was as fleshed out as it could have been and didn't come across as the contract hit man for the brotherhood that he was playing.  It wasn't because of his acting, it was more because of the script and how they presented Jesse Weiland in all his scenes.  At one point alluding to he had taken a break from hits to theft type crimes - that still wasn't a good explanation why they didn't spend more time building up the Weiland character to come across as a menacing thug. He was way too likeable, and even the Detective Carter appeared to like him.  I mean you can slap a whole bunch of Arian brotherhood tattoos on someone and that isn't what is going to make him that character.  All in all a good effort, but they should have dug a little deeper, it was there in their hands they could have had an outstanding movie.",1429228800,2,1297,4.222672064777328

Tom Berenger's attempt at a south Louisiana accent hurt my ears it was so bad. It would have been BETTER had he just not tried any accent at all and talked in his normal voice. Whenever he spoke, I couldn't tell if the accent was just THAT bad, or if he was actually doing some Adam Sandler type of accent from ""The Waterboy"" and make fun of Louisianians.

I think what helped the total picture was how awesome William Defoe was, and the bond created between him and Matt Dillon.

AND MATT DILLON- YOU COULD NOT ASK FOR MORE. These guys just are scary and BILL DUKE was refreshing as the 'TOP DOG' pulling the strings and telling everyone to 'do what they were told to do.

6090570,2,B00GMV8JVI,"Did you ever watch a film and as you were watching it you wondered, ""What the hell were the people making this thing thinking?""

That's what has happened here.

The script is not ""tight,"" but it's a decent script. The actors (Willem Dafoe, Matt Dillon, Tom Berenger, Amy Smart and Bill Duke) are all capable (or were at one time). The action sequences aren't shot well but....well, the whole thing should have been a lot better.

The greatest problems with this film are the pacing and the HORRIBLE attempts at Louisiana accents. The second biggest problem with this film is Tom Berenger. Berenger started out his professional career in the early to mid-1970's as a male model (yup, that's true) and then converted to a servicable actor, especially in films like Platoon (which also starred Willem Dafoe). But in recent years Berenger seems to have taken more interest in the bottle than acting and everything I've seen him in, he seems to be sleepwalking through his parts. He's so out of it in this film, that as the main villain in the piece, he's laughably silly acting and is not the least bit menacing. His accent comes and goes - not just scene to scene, but word to word in sentences.

The wardrobe person on this film should be sent back to school, because the ""costumes"" that are provided for Berenger's character are more appropriate for a Bourbon Street pimp than a white supremacist gang leader (didn't the filmmakers even bother to take a look at Sons of Anarchy?).

Dafoe does a decent job - as always, but surprisingly Matt Dillon turns in a wooden performance, where I would have expected him to be really on his game. It's a good part for him.

Facial hair deserves at least a line in the acting credits, because for some reason, the make-up person (which in turn should really be blamed on the director and producers) thinks that in the 1980's folks in Louisiana all had big handlebar mustaches. By the way, this was not the case. Dillon's facial hair is so outrageously fake looking that it may have been part of the reason he delivered such a poor performance.

I really wanted to like this film more than I did. It had so many things going for it. However, it just didn't work out that way in the end. The big climactic scene is sort of a bust. The most menacing scene (between Dillon and the man who killed his family) is not the climax, but is thankfully fairly well done.

the director worked on both the Boondock Saints 1 and 2, and there are hints that the over the top aspects of those films was intended for the screen here, but the director just didn't have the chops to deliver.  The director died the same year this film came out. I have to believe, that sadly, the director may have died before the filming completed and certainly before the film was edited, because this is really not what it should be.

It's a shame this film isn't better than it is. I can see the hints of it. While there are many films I will watch over and over, I can definitively say, this will never be one of those films.",1425081600,,3031,4.4845735027223235

6090859,2,B00GMV8JVI,"I was very disappointed by this seemingly promising 2014 crime film and I regret that I bought and watched it. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

PRECISION: this film was initially supposed to have for title ""Whiskey Bay"" and on some webpages it can still be found under this name

Somewhere in Louisiana police officer Bud Stewart (Willem Dafoe) makes a seemingly rather routine arrest, but he quickly starts to suspect that the criminal he apprehended, Jesse Weiland (Matt Dillon), far from being simply a burglar, a fence and a gun smuggler is in fact something much worse - and also somebody much important. Initially very loyal to his bosses, Jesse ultimately agrees to turn informant, after his younger brother is murdered and it appears that his wife Lynn (Amy Smart) is not being taken care of and lives penniless. It is then revealed that he works in fact for a large criminal network, which was formed first in prison by numerous violent felons who also all share a visceral hatred of ethnic minorities. This organization is never named but it is clear that it was inspired by Aryan Brotherhood. And then the film really begins...

A gumbo which mixes a really bad@ss police officer, a neo-Nazi gangster turned supergrass, gun trafficking, diamond smuggling, a mob lawyer, FBI, ATF, DOAs, GSWs, corrupt Washington lobbyist, a wire and an insane racist goon named Catfish (!) Stanton should in principle be at least a honest treat. To improve this combo they even threw in a Cajun (a bad un...) villain, who not only is covered in swastikas, but, supreme proof of evil wickedness, he even speaks FRENCH...)))!!! This pretty scary guy, played by Tom Berenger, is named Lutin Adams (Tom Berenger) and this is actually a pretty good joke, because ""Lutin"" means ""little elf"" in French...)))

Quite a lot of good actors were hired for this film. Willem Dafoe, Matt Dillon and Tom Berenger are of course major stars and always a pleasure to watch in anything. As for Amy Smart I admit that I have a major crush on her ever since I saw her next to Denise Richards in ""Straship Troopers"" - and notwithstanding the stellar beauty of Ms Richards I completely forgot about her and had instead a ""Who is THAT girl?"" moment... In this film, albeit her screen time is finally rather limited, she simply SHINES!

There are also many familiar faces in secondary roles, like Bill Duke (Mac in ""Predator""), Kevin Chapman (Detective Lionel Fusco in ""Person of Interest"") and Frederick Weller (US Marshall Marshall Mann from ""In Plain Sight"").

Sadly, all those good ideas and good actors were used poorly. After a honest beginning the film starts to turn into boring absurdity. Decisions made by all the protagonists usually don't make any sense. Interesting characters are destroyed quickly. Interesting possibilities are never explored - or closed as soon as they appear. F-bombs and shootings become quickly the whole plot. Cops ROUTINELY torture suspects - who seem to ignore even the fact that there are entitled to a lawyer... And let's not even talk about the last 30 minutes... Finally, action scenes are just ridiculous Chuck Norris style shootings (one bullet-proof guy who never misses against dozens of bullet-attracting guys who cannot shoot) - and Chuck Norris style shootings are fun only when they are performed by Chuck Norris...

The only two things which are really worth seeing in this film are Amy Smart and the one short scene in which Willem Dafoe can finally pay back Tom Berenger for what he did to him in ""Platoon""...)))

6090866,3,B00GMV8JVI,"I enjoyed the movie - as long as I didn't think about the storytelling kinks - but, once again, solid acting holds things together. Matt Dillon and Willem Dafoe are standouts in the school of ""Let's do a good job"" acting, no matter the story or pay. It shows. The story itself is interesting, avoiding the unrealistic heroics of most B actioners. But, sadly, the movie itself feels like either whole expository scenes were cut or they just fell back on cliches to get past any concern with details. Thus, one gets a ""major organized crime ring"" that seems to be run by one rich guy (a fine Tom Berenger) and two drooling rednecks --- at least until two shootout set pieces when a dozen silhouettes and/or new faces appear on the bad guy side. Same goes for the good guys: the cliche too young/too bureaucratic fed v the rough/smart local undercover cop -- guess who's always right? And so on. It feels like this was a real story, and like Serpico or The French Connection it could have had some resonance if the filmmakers had trusted to storytelling instead of action cliches at key moments. Well, at least it has a nice sense of location feel and some solid backup work by actors like Amy Smart - though, once again, some of the other smaller characters are just fill-ins for space. Watch it to pass the time and enjoy it at that.",1420934400,,1332,4.48559670781893
6090867,3,B00GMV8JVI,"The film is based on a true story in 1983 Louisiana. It tells you what happens in the opening read. From a lone snitch, a crime empire is taken down. Bud Carter (Willem Dafoe) is the local detective who has discovered the operation. With the ineffective help of the government and inside man Jesse (Matt Dillon), Carter struggles to do his job.

Being based on a true story hampers some of the drama. There were plenty of shoot'em up scenes. I thought Dafoe and Dillon did great jobs in their roles, but somehow the local flavor of Louisiana didn't come through. The sound track needed to be taken to another level. We needed to see more of the crimes action. It is listed as a gritty crime action thriller. It meets the requirements of the description, yet most of the individual scenes looked made for TV.

Will make on okay rental. No need to rush out and see it.

6092330,3,B00GMV8JVI,I don't know if it was the actors but considering the gore and the violence it should have seemed more tarantino than disney.  Somehow it winds up seeming like a nice version of a Tarantino film with all the gross but not really gross.  It had to have been the casting and the script.  It's like going on the It's a small world ride and chucky is in the sceneries.  This could maybe become a cult film but needs a little more for that to happen.,1417996800,,445,4.1395348837209305

They don't really put dialog in movies anymore, just mindless fight scenes, blood spatter and car chases (well those are fun)  because that is the only thing the average viewer can comprehend anymore.  Hey, myself included most of the time.
I liked this movie a lot.  Tom Berenger was excellent!  Matt Dillon was exceptional.  Willem Dafoe was at his usual amazing best, maybe his accent slipped once or twice.  Really great work by all.",1417046400,3,700,4.544

6093053,4,B00GMV8JVI,"Bad Country offers Willem Dafoe the chance to once again being his special 'police officer magic' to the screen.  While certainly not as over the top and flamboyant as his portrayal in Boondock Saints but played just as doggedly.

Bad Country also offers an older, portlier Tom Berenger a chance to reunite with Dafoe years after the 1986 masterpiece Platoon.

Bad Country has Matt Dillon as the token bad guy ready to flip and work for truth and justice as a way to see his newborn soon grow up.  When that doesn't go quite as planned, things change and the feds agenda is no longer as important as his own.

The character development and interaction is very good.  With the exception of a sidebar now about a long our of the picture father retrieving, this movie stays focused allowing the movie and action to unfold at a nice pace.  Nothing stalls, nothing is over hurried.  This movie works nicely from start to finish.",1416614400,,923,4.619631901840491

From the culture, enviromonent, all the way down to having coffee and carring a cane.

It was the first time, I had ever seen Dafoe in cowboy boots, Bearinger with extra weight, and Dillon as a police informant. One thing, I wish the movie would of pressed more on, was the time both Bearinger and dillion spent in prison. To form the mob and Dillion's inception into the military.

6093542,3,B00GMV8JVI,"It's always great to see an actor rise from what he once was to something far better. Such has been the case, at least for me, when I look at the career of Matt Dillon. He began as a teen heartthrob back in the seventies and at the time I was never quite fond of him. His acting always seemed the same to me, a sullen look and grin that became repetitive instead of showing acting ability. As he aged though, Dillon began to show that he did indeed have some acting chops. His roles became more adult in a good way rather than the sordid style some young actors take. His latest shows he still has plenty of great roles yet to come.

BAD COUNTRY takes place in the seventies in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A huge crime syndicate runs almost every criminal enterprise in the county. Someone high up in the organization has the money and means to pay off judges, law enforcement and anyone who might stand in their way. Detective Bud Carter (Willem Dafoe) has had enough of it. He wants to take down the man at the top, bypassing the small fries that he always seems to get. A chance arrest of one of these men gives him that opportunity.

Jesse Wieland (Dillon) has done tough time in prison in the past. Facing more time isn't anything he can't handle physically. But as a new father, married to a woman he loves (Amy Smart), he wants to be outside to raise his child. Carter offers him a chance to do so by becoming an informant, a man inside that will help him bring down the syndicate. At first Jesse turns down the offer. When the man outside has his drug using brother, also in prison, killed, Jesse decides to have his revenge.

With the hope of taking on the syndicate now Carter is disappointed when the Feds jump onboard. Instead of a seasoned vet they send in a green attorney to head the investigation, a man on his first case. To say that the teams involved don't work well together is an understatement. The local police, the FBI and the ATF all want a piece of the action. It's the ineptitude of the Federal agencies that nearly bring the whole thing to a horrible collapse.

Jesse works his way back into the syndicate headed by Lutin (Tom Berenger). While Lutin may try to appear to be a father figure of sorts to his crew he is indeed the most ruthless man living in Louisiana at the time. Jesse pulls off a jewel theft for him to start and then works up to buying illegal arms. When that deal goes bad due to one of his crew losing his temper, all hell breaks lose and the chances of the entire project are up in the air. Only Jesse can save this sting and in doing so will have to lay his life on the line.

When you have an ensemble cast like this one, one of two things can happen. A single actor can chew up the scenery and spit it out making the entire cast look bad. Or they can work harmoniously to achieve a solid story and film that entertains and keeps your interest. The second is what happens here. Dafoe's portrayal of Carter displays a man desperate to make a difference but at the same time with enough heart to want to protect even a contract killer like Jesse when he's placed in harm's way. Dillon shows a man dealing with the mistakes of his past in the hope of redeeming himself. And Berenger, a great actor rarely given the roles he deserves these days, brings life to Lutin making him seem like an elder statesman of crime who is every bit as lethal when brought face to face with someone as he was when he was younger. Toss in Neal McDonough in a role unlike those he's played before and you have a great cast working at top form.

While an entertaining and well done film, this is not what I would consider Oscar material. Instead it does the best thing a movie can do by telling a story and making you feel for the characters involved. Some could have had more development along those lines but the two leads make you want something good to happen their way. You want the bad guys to get their just deserts. By the last 30 minutes you beg for that to happen.

So get ready to feel that southern humidity ooze out of your pores. Grab a sweet tea and set back. Know that bad times are coming for some and heroics from others. And finally sit back and enjoy the ride.",1400630400,8,4203,4.265997490589712

6093566,3,B00GMV8JVI,It was pretty good for a low budget film.  Better than what I expected.  I watched it with my husband and he liked it.,1399680000,,118,3.875
6093567,3,B00GMV8JVI,"If you are looking to be entertained, this movie will keep your interest.  If you are looking to be knocked off your feet, go watch Lawless, or Captain America, or 47 Ronin, or The Wolverine.  This is not a well-written, thrilling story.  It is a mediocre, realistic crime drama with a tone more like that of a TV movie.  The difference is that these characters are brought to life by acting heavyweights!  Even the smallest part is well-acted.  You will HATE the bad guys and admire the good ones.

The worst part, in my opinion, is when our hero cop (Willem Dafoe), roughs up the corrupt lawyer (Neal McDonough), who physically is like a superhero.  Neal REALLY HAS TO ACT.  I laughed at that part, and it brought me out of the story.  You'll see why.

The ending was not satisfying at all.  It made me feel like all of the risk our anti-hero (Matt Dillon) went through was for nothing.  The last scene is presented as if we should think it is a slick move, a bit of poetic justice--but frankly someone's head needed to be blown off.  It was NOT a clever ending, but a soft, weak-kneed portrayal of our ineffective justice system.

This movie felt realistic.  It is worth watching if you have already seen all the better movies out.  Still, it's much better than current films like Gravity, Art of the Steal, etc.",1399680000,,1315,4.481012658227848

6093575,5,B00GMV8JVI,"This movie was fantastic! Willem Defoe was outstanding, I believe his best role ever. I normally do not care for Matt Dillon as an actor; this movie has changed my opinion. To be honest when seeing the opening credits and read Matt Dillon was in the movie, my first thought was; ""this movie is going to suck!"" Matt Dillon proved me wrong! His acting was the best I have ever seen him perform, I have mentioned this movie several times now to friends. It's gritty, surprising and so damn entertaining; it is a movie I will purchase the DVD so I may watch it whenever I want to. I thought the end of the film was really great, it left you wondering whats more to the story without leaving you hanging waiting for a part 2; but it allows you to speculate the ""what if"" of the film. If you have watched the movie ""No Country for Old Men"" and loved it, you will love this movie too.
Don Yesso's character I think was down played too much. I believe his character had a lot to contribute, and was short sighted. Don Yesso has a strong presence and the ability to pull off this character, in a sence I don't believe they gave Don enough in this role for his acting ability.
There are some outstanding shoot-out scenes that were very fun, I am very critical when it comes to weapons and how they are used in movies; this was well done.

In Loving Memory of Chris Brinker (1970-2013)

Five RELENTLESS Stars. In what is both his directorial debut and his final offering on the silver screen, the late, great, award-winning director Chris Brinker spins a gem of a relentless, fast-paced, cops and robbers film set in the area of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In the 1980s, an ambitious local crime boss is using some ruthless help to build an empire. In the plot, Matt Dillon, Willem Dafoe, Neal McDonough, Bill Duke, and an almost unrecognizable Tom Berenger create some memorable characters as Dafoes character is unrelenting in his pursuit of a hunch about local crime activities. Also co-starring Amy Smart, Kevin Chapman, Don Vesso, Christopher Denham, John Edward Lee, Frederick Weller, James Lew, and more. Co-produced with Jim Crabbe and directed by Chris Brinker. Highly Recommended. Five DETERMINED Stars. (CB Productions, ANA Media and Mandalay Vision. Rated-R. Color. HD. CC. X-Ray. Time-1:44:21.
