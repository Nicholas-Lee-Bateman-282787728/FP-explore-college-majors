8125646,5,B000FQJPQY,"the whole movie was an acid trip. I loved the set designs and the dance numbers were funny - there's a scene where men crawl under women twerking in kimonos with baskets strapped to their butts, so strange is an understatement.  i'd def recommend it, although it is a VERY weird movie.",1414627200,3,285,4.480769230769231
8125647,4,B000FQJPQY,"This is a rare gem, but some people get thrown off by the abstract Portuguese background, but they forget that they were the first Europeans there. It's kabuki theater come to film!",1414454400,,181,4.6875
8125648,3,B000FQJPQY,"A different film than we may be used to, but for fans, can be a single viewing dvd. Not great, not horrible, just different",1303516800,,123,4.166666666666667
8125649,2,B000FQJPQY,"As noted in the product description, ""Princess Raccoon"" is a musical romantic comedy. The premise: a young prince, who has no mother but has a father intent on being the ""fairest of all,"" is underhandedly exiled for developing into someone threateningly handsome; while he is being smuggled to a land where he is to undergo some sort of horrific fate, the ""Ostrich Monk"" court assassin loses the prince in the forest of the raccoons (or, rather, ""tanuki"" who often function in Japanese myth like the raven in Native American myth); the prince falls in love with a beautiful woman, who turns out to be the raccoon princess on an unscheduled outing, and she falls for him-- a bad thing, which gets him locked up by the rest of the raccoons. Hijinks ensue.

Some reviews describe ""Princess Raccoon"" as a surreal musical comedy. That is an understatement. Relying on equal parts of traditional designs, stage sets, wide vistas, and chaos, ""Princess Raccoon"" is more like something that would have resulted were Gilbert and Sullivan oriental, modern, and not interested in character development. It pokes definite (and inaccurate) fun at Catholicism, Disney concepts, hide-bound male-female relationships, western theatre, and eastern theatre. Unfortunately, in stuffing all of this potentially good comedy in, the continuity suffers tremendously.

The costumes are magnificent. The music is charming. The plot is slow to start and very rushed, though, and then there's the problem of following the convolutions through sub-par dialogue.

Two Stars: Rent it, don't own it. The problems outweigh the delights.",1283731200,4,1603,5.2784313725490195
8125650,5,B000FQJPQY,"Funny story and music,very good video quality(looks like blu-ray),colorful image. You will see Ziyi singing and dancing. Collection for Asian movie lover and Ziyi's fans",1245369600,2,169,5.8
8125651,5,B000FQJPQY,"and this film -- quite pretty in itself -- is great fun in every respect.  And its various ""meanings"" begin to reveal themselves with repeated viewings.

And the ""Making of"" extras -- which are quite extensive, from her first meeting with the director to the tearsome film wrap-up -- are also English-subtitled in this release.

Charming all around.  So much so I now have three different releases of it for their different covers.",1241654400,3,431,4.863013698630137
8125652,5,B000FQJPQY,"Loved this movie.  I'm a westerner, spent time in Japan, loved this live-action fairy-tale love story.  Even though the writer/director is somewhere in his 80's, he has a funny, surprising and high-energy style that will enchant you.  If you're used to Disney and Pixar, maybe you should give it a miss, because it's off-beat and surprising--but I'm buying a copy for myself--loved it.",1217462400,6,385,5.079365079365079
8125653,2,B000FQJPQY,"I'm part Japanese but I found this musical is so alien to my American-bred sensibilities that it seemed very strange and creepy. It colorful in a gaudy way with very cartoonish qualities. At least, it has the adorable Zhang Ziyi at the center (she's speaks mostly Chinese in this Japanese film).

The best part of the DVD for me was the behind-the-scenes featurette which focused on Zi. I was surprised that she switched to English a few times when talking with her Chinese/Japanese translator. And there's a ""cute"" moment when a little girl, an extra, speaks to Zi in English (you'll understand the quotes after seeing it).

This one, you might want to rent first before deciding to purchase.",1201392000,4,693,4.815126050420168
