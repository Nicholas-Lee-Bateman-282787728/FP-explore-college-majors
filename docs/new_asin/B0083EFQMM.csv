(I realize this review seems like a betrayal on my part.
considering how much I love this genre.
But something about this movie just irked me.
It's just too half assed, not gory enough, not sexy enough, not pervy
enough, not gross enough and the lack of action beyond the stilted
confrontations just made me snap. I mean hell I enjoyed ""samurai princess""
and Kyony doragon (another of my reviews people hate for some reason lol))***

The Tokyo Gore genre (as I like to call it) is a weird one.
It is a mix or reinvention of the splatterfest/gore genre but with a Japanese twist.
The leaders in this movement are Yoshihiro Nishimura and Noburo Iguchi. Thought the genre
was not invented by them, Yoshihiro leads the way with his goretastic oldschool special fx.

There has been great entrees into the genre such as ""The Machine Girl"", ""Tokyo Gore Police""
good ones such as ""Vapire Girl Vs Frankenstien Girl"", ""Psycho and Gothic Lolita"" and lesser ones
such as ""Robo Geisha"" and ""Samurai Princess"" just for examples.

Z.A.T.O.T.D (this film) falls into the lesser category...
The movie lacks true comedic laughs, with goofy fart jokes that fall flat every time.
It tries to be gross but it fails in that respect as well.
Of all the movies in this genre this one truly fails to entertain.
Even Nishimura's fx can't save the film, nor can the attractive female actresses.
Though in this respect they try, of the three main leads you have a very large breasted
beauty and an all around beautiful girl that hits all the right proportions.
The Main lead while pretty, has what the model industry calls a ""Boys Body""

There really isn't much else to say, the plot is dumber than usual the action is
poor and stilted with very little martial arts and the movie just feels lifeless...",1376870400,4,1782,4.68370607028754

This is by no means a good movie, but it is perfect for people looking for a little brain dead (get it, zombies? Yeah this movie is as bad as that pun) fun.

5124652,5,B0083EFQMM,"A largely inappropriate, exploitative fecal fiesta of tapeworm-induced zombiism.  If you love butt and fart jokes, then this may be your Tokyo Shock Pulp Fiction (1994).  I loved it!  Needless to say, you shouldn't watch this with your mother.

Considering that the opening credits features girls dancing in short shorts and eating hot dogs, it seems that horror comedy writer/director Noboru Iguchi (The Machine Girl, RoboGeisha, The ABCs of Death  F is for Fart, Dead Sushi) will never change his quirky waysnot that I'm complaining at all.  In fact, I'd call this his best work yet BY FAR and one of the better installments to the growing exploitative Tokyo Shock genre.

A group of friends venture to the wilderness in search of trout parasites (tapeworms which they'll evidently catch with a butterfly net) to make wannabe actress Maki (Asana Mamoru) thinner so she can be famous.  Fearing that a zombie would have them arrested for catching trout off-season, they abandon their mission.  But not before the large-breasted Maki swallows a fishing lure-like tapeworm to begin her journey to skinny town.

They wander to a nearby village which is filled with diarrhea-smeared zombies which vomit, you guessed it, more diarrhea.  Why?  I have no idea, probably because it's gross and it makes drunk and high people laughand me.  While succumbing to some wicked constipation along with the emergence of an evil mutant butt-tapeworm from her rear end, Maki becomes zombie kibble.
Our protagonist Matrix-bullet-dodging, martial artist, school girl Megumi (Arisa Nakamura; The ABCs of Death  F is for Fart, Kazuo Umezu's Horror Theater: The Harlequin Girl) is a quiet, innocent loner.  But when the s*** hits the fan and the crap-covered deadites are upon them she gains a Dwayne Johnson-like proficiency for shotgun headshots and general asskickery.

We learn that every zombie has an evil monster tapeworm, which actually eats and then controls the brain of the infected body, and the zombies bite to infect others with tapeworm eggs.  An early symptom of this tapeworm-induced zombiism is profuse fart emission.  Hmmmm, I'm no tapeworm expert buuuuuuuuutseems legit.

Inappropriate bathroom scenes, a butt-to-mouth skewering, exploitative grabbing, laboratory enemas, a lot of sexual and phallic scenes involving tapeworms, some nudity, feces-slathered sewage zombies, lots of bleeding from the tush, sexual tapeworm impregnation, panty-revealing high kicks, weaponized anal tapeworms and gastrointestinal sound effects all do their integral parts to contribute to this fart-scored film's raunchy charm.

Poo is everywhere.  The stool-studded zombies even throw feces like they're in the middle of a monkey crap-fight at the zoo.  There's spraying vomit (done with weak effects), blood-gushing prosthetic dismemberments, and the jettisoned gore is complemented by CGI and silly scenarios.  It's all done quite well and there was hardly a slow minute in this movie.

What really stoked the fires of hilarity is when the zombies start skittering  backwards, butts in the air with their evil butt-tapeworms turtle-heading out of their rectal domains ready to strike.

Regarding the action, this movie truly succeeded where its predecessors failed.  The action was often original and some of the hand-to-hand combat was not only quite entertaining and thoughtfully (though humorously) choreographed, but well-executed given the effects and budget.  We also enjoy tapeworms whipping from elevated cabooses like Scorpion's Mortal Kombat ""get over here"" harpoonwhich then turn a bit into Anime-style sexual assaults with tentacles.  The action-packed finale is loaded with diverse, decently-executed effects, a nifty monster for Megumi to fight, a clearly unconsensual tentacle mating scene, and aerial combat made possible by anal jet propulsion which all culminates in a Top Gun aerial death-by-enema victory!  Because, when zombie-infected tapeworm evil is defeated by an enema in a fart-propelled dogfight, don't we all win?

As if this movie could be spoiled for anyone, I'll now warn ""SPOILER ALERT.""  What really brings this together is the underlying plot that a scientist has an ""agreement"" with the tapeworms contingent on the tapeworms curing his daughter's myeloid leukemia.  See?  It's thoughtful writing like this that proves that there are still original ideas out there.

Despite the exploitative, highly sexualized nature of this movie, it's funny and never gets more than a bit awkwardly raunchyfor a Tokyo Shock film.  If you can handle the Evil Dead (2013) tree rape scene, then this will be fine.  It's all in good (i.e., totally gross and raunchy) fun and the action ranks quite high in Tokyo Shock canon.  This is one of the best Tokyo Shockers I've seen since I first saw Tokyo Gore Police (2008)!  Needless to say, you shouldn't watch this with your mother.

5124656,3,B0083EFQMM,"This is a disgusting movie , and it's meant to be. It's a fun movie but it's also aimed at showing lots of butts and farts and toilets. Parasites take over a village and such and people come out of toilets , and giant farts erupt from hot babes butts. Well , that should clue you in that this is not a serious zombie flick. It is about weirdness and showing hot babes.  But one of them is a buttkicker and fights the hordes and such with a ax.  This is played tongue in CHEEKS!  , and you will laugh at it. But it is very offensive and disgusting and that's what it wants to be too. If you can't handle this type of over the top flick , then this isn't for you.  It does feature some cool heads exploding and such.  This is lowbrow stuff and NOT for kids at all , on a lot of levels.

I was so disgusted by the quality of this thing that I bought another one from a different source to compare . The second one is totally the opposite : It is pressed , not burned . And the case/disc artwork are not cheap copies .

The one good thing is that this is a longer version (possibly uncut) than what is available from other countries . This cut has more gore as well as , how can I put this politely , extended parasite insertions . Not a movie for the kiddies for sure .
