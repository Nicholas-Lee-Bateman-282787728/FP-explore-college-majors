These DVD's are playable in ALL regions

Part 1: The Jordan River

The river Jordan tumbles from its source below the slopes of Mount Hermon to the Dead Sea, the lowest point on the earth's surface. Along the way it passes through rocky gorges, a broad shallow swamp, and the Sea of Galilee. This documentary reveals the wildlife of the river and the events in history which have endangered its survival.

Part 2:The Crowded Desert

More than seventy percent of the Holy Land is desert, but it is not a lifeless desert. Leopards hunt wild ibexes among the cliffs above the Dead Sea Valley, and hyraxes and songbirds gather to drink at a precious oasis. This video examines the effect of human occupation with its resident inhabitants, which seems to be balanced by a complex and rugged ecosystem. Changes have come as the Dead Sea shore is now a holiday resort for young Israelis and tourists seeking relaxation in this desert environment.

Part 3: Along the Sea Road

The Mediterranean coast and the northern forest of the Holy Land have been known to travelers and traders for hundreds of years, from the Phoenicians and early Arabs to the Greeks and the Romans. As one of the oldest inhabited parts of the world, the sea road shows the marks of centuries of continuous habitation. Yet the wildlife - including lizards, hedgehogs, leopards, snakes, deer, and nesting birds , still flourish among the sand dunes and the remnant forest. 500797d
