Like seriously.  It's like this frisbee  weapon that you throw over a person's head and then pull it back causing the victim's head to get cut off!  It has a lot of camp value to it. Picture quality isn't that great.  Story is interesting but can be rather boring at times.  If you really like these type of films, then go ahead and try this one out.  If not, then stay clear",1472601600,,539,4.267326732673268

Fast forward to the present, i was thinking about this film and decided to look it up on here and found it  on DVD at a good price. This movie is as cheesy as it gets with terrible  special effects but it's action packed and i love this movie. Of the 4 flying guillotine movies that i own, this one is my second favorite. Anything starring Chen Sing and Carter Wong can't be too bad. Chen Sing plays Shen, a man who damages his heart practicing kungfu and goes to No Return Valley to seek out the dragons breath cure but  he can't leave or he will fall ill again, so he stays there for 20 years. In that time , he teaches himself the lighting strike technique which is the flying guillotine. The evil prince offers him a book stolen from the shaolin temple that can heal his heart if he will teach his men the lighting strike. The shaolin priests and other clans send their best fighters to no return valley to get the book back and kill Shen before he can join up  with the evil prince. It also has a surprise ending which i thought was cool too. Don't expect great picture quality since this was transferred to DVD from a VHS source. The real surprise is the DVD contains 10 minutes of footage not in the VHS that clears up the storyline a bit better. If your looking for good, campy, old school kungfu fun then this movie is for you.",1413417600,,1424,4.148550724637682
7929752,5,B0000524DE,"You know how some movies are so absolutely worthless that they end up being mind numbingly brilliant? That is Fatal Flying Guillotines. The fight scenes...silly and comical and poorly choreographed...the acting...ahahah...the acting...ahahahahahahahha....it really is amazing...the dubbing helps too...it adds a whole new level to the bad/goodness of this flick. the story? do you really need a story? the main character in this movie has a ""technique"" that basically consists of flying giant bells on ropes out to sever people's heads, because his heart condition has driven him insane. I think I've said enough. Now you need to purchase this so you can show it to your friend and impress them with your knowledge of little known, yet devastatingly funny ""kung fu"" movies. cuz im not really sure this is kung fu. Its bell fu. Look at me, still rambling. Anyways...buy this.",1020988800,3,874,5.205673758865248
7929753,2,B0000524DE,"Being the mark that I am for movie gimmicks, I purchased this film in hopes of seeing more of the flying guillotine which I have become so fond of over the years.  ... It's nothing more than a jug attached to a chain.  Granted, we're talking about a flying guillotine but come on.  If you want to see a real flying guillotine movie, wait a month or so and watch ""master of the flying guillotine."" I beleive it comes out into theatres next month.",998006400,3,445,4.273809523809524
7929754,4,B0000524DE,"This is a kung fu classic.  The Emperor has one of his henchmen create a weapon which is thrown thru the air, lands on someone's head and beheads them.  He then has a dozen killers trained to use it, and starts executing people.  After a few killings one of the trained killers decides he wants out, and the hunt is on to kill him.
The movie has some jerky-ness to it, as the film they used was not in great shape, but for those who watched kung fu theartre on saturday afternoons as a kid this is a must have.  Second only to Jade Claw.",990921600,6,537,4.085714285714285
