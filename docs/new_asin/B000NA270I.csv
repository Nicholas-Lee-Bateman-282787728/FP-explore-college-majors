8176225,4,B000NA270I,"I purchased this DVD because it was required viewing for a film music class I'm taking in college. I was afraid it was going to be incredibly boring, but it wasn't. It is well crafted, interesting and informative.",1374278400,,213,4.631578947368421
8176226,4,B000NA270I,"I love music from the movies, and on this dvd they demonstrate how its put together, wonderful.  I just wish sound track from The Big Country , with Gregory Peck was on there.",1350604800,,175,4.303030303030303
8176227,4,B000NA270I,"I have been interested in movie music even before John Williams  brought it to the public's attention. Max Steiner, Alfred Newman, Erich Korngold, Dimitri Tiomkin, Miklos Rosza, Alex North, and Bernard Herrmman, all great writers of musical scores, always had my attention while I watched the movies they scored for. That's my complaint about this DVD. Only a few of the writers I mentioned are on this disc, and. as far as I'm concerned, not presented long enough. As beautiful as David Rakin's theme from Laura is, I don't put him in the same class as the writers I have named. Yet this disc devotes more time to him than the others. That's why I'm not giving it five stars. It's commendable that movie writers are getting their due, and this disc gives you some insight  how they worked. It's worth buying. I know there are CDs out with movie music, but I'm hoping a more comprehensive DVD disc will be issued soon.",1328918400,4,918,4.625766871165644
8176228,5,B000NA270I,"An excellent overview of the Golden Age of Hollywood film music, brimming with musical and historical insight, (Who knew that von Korngold imbued his score for ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" with protest against Nazism?) The personalities of that era's great composers come through--Steiner, Newman, Waxman, Tiomkin--even though there is hardly time enough to do any full justice. The lion's share of coverage goes to David Raskin and the story of his composition of the signature theme for ""Laura"": Even if you know that tale, Raskin's own retelling of it is delightful, and he is good company. The disc serves equally as a primer, introducing the craft of film scoring, as well as a time capsule for the more knowledgeable. The production is intelligently written and well edited. Highly recommended.",1291766400,8,802,5.176923076923077
8176229,5,B000NA270I,Fully agree with the previous two reviews - an excellent view of the people in the Hollywood Golden Era created their scores. Very insightful and interesting.,1231372800,5,158,5.115384615384615
8176230,5,B000NA270I,"Both an educational and entertaining look at the classic Hollywood music scoring of the 1930s and 1940s. Host and narrator John Mauceri conducts the BBC National Orchestra of Wales in carefully selected music cues from such classics as Laura, Bride of Frankenstein, Gone With the Wind, Casablanca, Adventures of Robin Hood, The Song of Bernadette, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Johnny Belinda, How Green Was My Valley and Red River. Composer David Raksin gives us in depth background on the composing of his famous theme for ""Laura"". The process of film scoring is touched explored. Anyone who loves the film music of Steiner, Newman, Waxman, Korngold and Raskin will find this a fascinating 85 minutes. This would be great for a film course also. Highly recommended!",1187481600,26,766,5.087301587301587
