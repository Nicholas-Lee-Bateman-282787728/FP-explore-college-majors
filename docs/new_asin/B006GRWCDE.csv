4987650,5,B006GRWCDE,"I'm overjoyed that ""Most Valuable Players"" has finally been released on DVD.  Oprah Winfrey Network isn't part of my cable package, so I wasn't able to see its world premiere.  I tore off the cellophane when it arrived and watched it immediately.  I was not disappointed.  The movie is tuneful, joyous, sobering and just a whole lot of fun.  The ""Freddy Awards"" themselves is an amazing ceremony and the film captures all its best moments in relation to the characters.  John is the athlete who gets stage-struck, Zach is the awkward teen who finds comfort on stage and with his theater friends, Amanda is the shy girl off stage and a dynamo on, Katie and Ali are the super talented mean girls who hide a more vulnerable interior.  The movie surprises with a sub-plot that comes out of the blue and puts the fun and games into a more meaningful perspective.  For a documentary, this looks slick and sounds great in surround sound.  Special mention goes to the terrific musical score by Randy Miller.  The DVD is filled with generous extras.  There is a show that reunites most of the cast.  It's awesome.  There are great deleted scenes.  I guess the filmmakers followed other schools and couldn't include them in the film.  The scene with Pius Catholic High School and the nun/teacher makes me yearn to see more of that.  I also liked hearing about Nazareth High School, a school which refused to take part in the Freddy Awards.  The extras also have an outtake reel which is good for some laughs.  There is also running commentary which allows you to hear the filmmakers talk over the film as they chat about their experience.  This is terrific because there's some very interesting insight.  The commentary is funny and entertaining.  But listen to it after you see the movie.
Overall, ""Most Valuable Players"" is a fantastic movie and an even better DVD considering all the extras that you couldn't see in the theater or on OWN.",1329955200,,1931,4.704477611940298
4987651,5,B006GRWCDE,"Truly an eye-opening piece that provided me with great insight into an area that the majority of Americans, myself included, know very little about. After highlighting the struggles faced by high school theater programs, the documentary gave great insight into the many individuals that made each production so special. Well done!",1329782400,5,330,5.490196078431373

8497748,5,B006GRWCDE,"I am from a Midwestern state that values its sports more than anything else, from professional to college and right down to the high school level. Just the name of this film, MOST VALUABLE PLAYERS, begs the question of why so much money is being put into athletics and not into the arts, such as theater. This is a touching story of high school ""kids"" (and the teachers that teach them) putting everything they have into the most collaborative ""team"" they may ever be a part of: a high school production of a musical. The Oscars, The Emmy Awards, The Tony Awards...and now The Freddy Awards! I am thrilled to say these awards are now part of my lexicon. A lovely film.",1371600000,,668,4.483606557377049

8497750,3,B006GRWCDE,"Great movie to promote the Arts in our school system.
Not crazy about the editing.

8497751,5,B006GRWCDE,"""Most Valuable Players"" is a movie for anyone who has ever done theater: high school, college, community theater or even Broadway.  I was not expecting this to be as utterly engaging, moving and as much fun as it is.  I was genuinely surprised.  The documentary follows three different high schools in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania as they prepare for their annual stage musical productions, a season of theater that ends in the coveted Freddy Awards which are touted as the Tony Awards for high school musical theater.  The movie takes us on the journey to the televised award ceremony where the three schools vie for top honors including Best Overall Musical.  There is an earnest, good spirit running through this film.  It's ""feel good"" in every sense of the word, and there are moments that bring about laughter and tears and plenty of goose bumps. The students and teachers show a love and respect for what they're doing and each other that is truly admirable.  The climax is at the Freddy Awards and there's plenty of song and dance and suspense too.  This is a documentary you can watch with your whole family.  In fact, it hardly feels like a documentary at all because it all flows so free and natural.  The DVD is packed with great extras like nine deleted scenes, a reunion featurette called ""On Stage with MVP,"" and wonderful filmmaker commentary by director/producer Matthew D. Kallis and writer/producer Christopher Lockhart.  The filmmakers are informative, engaging and pretty funny too.  Plus there's interviews with the filmmmakers, and an outtake reel and some trailers from the OWN Documentary Club library.  A great purchase that can be watched again and again and will not disappoint!",1330387200,2,1711,4.940559440559441
8497752,5,B006GRWCDE,"I play hockey. I don't do musical theatre. That being said, I loved this film. My girlfriend grabbed my hockey bag and sat it on the sofa next to her. I knew something serious was up because the smell of the bag alone has threatened our otherwise fantastic relationship. She said I could not have my manhood back until I sat with her and watched Most Valuable Players. I tried to get myself out of the torture I was certain I was about to endure but she gave me ""the look"". Being a fan of the Dog Whisperer, I knew it was time for me to sit down. From the first images of the grainy sports kids/theatre kids montage, to the final fade out, I was captivated. No narrator telling me what to think. No shaky camera shots that drive me nuts. No stupid sub-titles because the audio was poorly recorded. Only a well thought out and executed film about the heart and soul of theatre kids and their parents. I actually teared up many times because the film brought me back to my parents taking me to the rink, encouraging me on how hard work and effort will take me farther than God given talent. There's no crying in hockey but there is in theatre. The parallels of my hardcore sports upbringing and the passion these theatre kids exhibit was a revelation for me. Its just that I wore a uniform and they wear costumes. Come to think of it, some folks will say my hockey sweater and stockings held up by a garter hidden by my hip pants resemble something of a costume. Never thought of that before. Anyhoo, this film opened my eyes and heart to the what all of us have in common - a passion for the things we love and the importance of working hard to live our dream. The lessons brought to us by this wonderful film is something that needs to be shared. Now if I can only get that damn smell out of the sofa!",1330387200,5,1801,4.238372093023256
8497753,5,B006GRWCDE,"Most Valuable Players is one of the most joyful documentaries I have ever seen. I saw this film nearly a year ago at Docuweek (LA), and was hoping to see it again on DVD.  I found it to be even more entertaining and enlightening the second time around.  There are also lots of great extras including Filmmaker Commentary, Deleted Scenes and a Cast Reunion segment.

'The film opens accessing support for the arts in sports crazy Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania. A newspaper editor states that more column inches are devoted to sports than any thing else in his newspaper, and millions are spent to maintain sports facilities, with little to nothing being spent on the arts. But as we learn from this thoroughly engaging doc, high school theater is also a team sport. ''

The film follows three high schools: Freedom, Emmaus and Parkland, and their talented students leading up to the Super Bowl of local musical theater, the Freddy Awards. The brainchild of State Theater CEO Shelly Brown, the annual Freddy's bring together 27 area high schools, as they compete for Tony like honors. All of which, including the nominations, is broadcast live on TV and streamed on the Internet to huge audiences.

Freedom High soccer standout and drama geek, John Andreadis, illustrates that there is no conflict between sports and the arts, when adults step aside and let the kids find their way. His parents are supremely understanding and supportive once they realize that the two disciplines are compatible. His drama teacher Jennifer Wesco makes sure that every one of her drama students understands that they do theater for themselves first and foremost, not for trophies and accolades. Parkland High director, Mark Stutz and Emmaus director Jill Kuebler are wonderfully honest and open cheerleaders for their students, as their two schools battle it out at the Freddy's, each with 16 nominations for their competing Les Mis productions.

It's the kids that profoundly demonstrate that their love for theater transcends all when they join together at what is truly their theater all-star game, The Freddy's.

Director Matthew D. Kallis and writer Christopher Lockhart have made a doc that really scores. For many of these students the Freddy's will be the pinnacle of their theater arts careers, but it's their high school experience that they will carry with them for the rest of their lives.",1330387200,2,2380,5.025380710659898
8497754,5,B006GRWCDE,My sister's a theater geek and made me watch this documentary with her.  I h-a-t-e showtunes but I laughed and cried throughout this extremely entertaining movie.  Doesn't matter if you're a theater geek or not because the movie connects on so many different levels and everyone has felt like an underdog or has wanted to find their place in the world.  Lots of great moments that we rewind and watch over and over.  I have a crush on John Andreadis who's the athlete that becomes Elvis!,1330041600,,487,4.627906976744186
