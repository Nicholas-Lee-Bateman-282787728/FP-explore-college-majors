6680211,5,B00NU6CP0Y,"Sound the trumpets, raise the drawbridge and drop the Oldsmobile, here is the new 3 disc Collectors Edition of Army of Darkness!
I won't spend any time reviewing the movie since most who are reading this have already seen it many times.  I instead want to review this version from the perspective of someone who has purchased this movie first on VHS, then clamshell VHS, DVD then bootleg edition DVD, well you get the picture.  If you are like me, you may be wondering if you should purchase this set?
First off, four different versions of the movie exist, the Theatrical, the Directors Cut, The TV Cut and the International Cut.  All four of these are included here for the first time on Blu-Ray!  The Directors Cut has the original ending and the syndicated cut is padded out to fill a 120 minute (minus commercials) block of time.  The TV cut is amazing and you will notice a ton of different scenes especially at the beginning.  The international cut is slightly different than each of the cuts and has a couple different scenes as well.  This is remastered in 4K and is a fine cut of the film.  This is the one that is also known as Captain Supermarket in Japan.
Extras:  Alternate Opening?  What is this?  Fans will be shocked to see a new opening including close-ups of Ash doing the voice-over and footage from Evil Dead 2 cut together.  Next there is a 96 minute documentary featuring all-new interviews and behind the scenes footage (some new, some old).  This was a lot of fun.  I love seeing footage of Sam and Bruce together- it must have been a lot of fun to witness this madness unfold.  Tons of behind the scenes videos and stills mostly centered on effects thanks to KNB are interesting as well.
Anyways, my wife will be happy to hear that I can finally ditch my 20 year old VHS dubbed copies of the TV cut complete with tracking problems and Sy-Fy logos as well as my International Cut with hardcoded Japanese Subs  and so can you!  Definitely pick it up and it is a great price for all 4 versions.  After years of suffering through middling repackagings of Army of Darkness and dashed hopes of another installment, we get the COMPLETE version of Army of Darkness and a new series ""Ash vs. the Evil Dead"" on STARZ!  Good times.  Now where is that ""Within the Woods""?",1444435200,33,2284,4.497572815533981

I bought it from a store locally here in Wisconsin and I also got 1 disk so the problem is still out there don't know why. But I did get a replacement. But that was annoying.

6680233,5,B00NU6CP0Y,"Excellent blu ray, with multiple cuts of the movie.  Many other reviewers have already commented on the details, so I won't repeat all that, but in short this title is big step up from previous DVD & Blu-ray releases. One thing I really like is the different artwork on each disc.  Some blu rays have a generic solid blue label, which is boring and a disservice to quality that blu ray promises. It's called 'attention to detail' and Scream Factory nailed it.  Nice work.",1476316800,4,471,4.583333333333333
6680234,5,B00NU6CP0Y,"This film is somewhat unique among other cult films in that there are just SO many different versions of it out there.  There's the theatrical cut, then the director's cut, the international cut, and of course, the TV cut aired on the SciFi channel (which is how I first saw the movie).  That's not even including the deleted/alternate scenes.  This made having a ""complete"" DVD/Blu ray package stupidly difficult.  Thankfully, however we no longer have that problem!  Scream Factory has given us a package with ALL four cuts of the film in one glorious 1080p package.  This film has been released so many times on home video, but if there truly was an ultimate edition, THIS is it!  I'll spare going into tiny details, but if you're thinking of buying this package, here's what you need to know:

1. Yes, all versions are included.  This is also the best they've ever looked, and not just because they're in high-definition.  Colors look great and various imperfections such as grain and dust have been removed (but for some reason, not in certain parts of the director's cut unfortunately).
2. The international cut is produced from a 4K scan and looks perhaps the best, although I believe they used this scan for the theatrical cut too.
3. Yes, the director's cut is the COMPLETE version (including the brief dress-ripping scene that was absent on earlier releases).
4. New and old special features are present, including deleted scenes and the ""making the Deadites"" feature from the ""Screwhead"" edition.
5. The TV cut is present as a special feature on the 3rd disc and appears to have been transferred from a VHS source.

In summary, if you're a fan and are tired of needing to own several different versions, this is for you.  You can get rid of your ""Screwhead"" edition blu ray, you can toss out your old VHS of the Sci-Fi channel version, and you don't have to worry about getting the R3 MGM director's cut.  It's all here and in glorious blu-ray.  Is it perfect?  No, but if you have to settle on one copy, THIS is the one to get.  It's the best version of a film that has been released too many times already.  Thank you, Scream Factory, for giving us fans what we wanted!",1475884800,,2182,4.625974025974026

6680247,5,B00NU6CP0Y,"When we last saw Ash Williams, he had been sucked through a time vortex and ended up in the 14th century... where he STILL had to contend with undead horrors. No, not going to give context.

""Army of Darkness"" pretty much picks up from there, finishing up the legendary trilogy that Sam Raimi started with ""The Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn."" This time around, Sam Raimi dials down the horror once again, while dialing up massive quantities of skeletal comedy -- while there's the odd gross-out moment (eyeball in the shoulder!), most of the story is devoted to the increasingly manic Bruce Campbell struggling to defeat an undead horde of skeletons with only his trusty boomstick and chainsaw.

Having appeared in the 14th century, Ash (Campbell) is immediately captured by the arrogant Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert), who mistakes him for one of Duke Henry's (Richard Grove) men. He tries to explain that he's not, but ends up tossed into an execution pit filled with iron spikes and demonic Deadites -- and only the timely intervention of the Wise Man (Ian Abercrombie) allows Ash to reclaim his chainsaw and ""boomstick,"" kill the Deadites, and establish that he is a prophesied savior come to free them from the Deadite scourge.

But of course, the entire universe hates Ash. So when he's sent on an incredibly simple quest to reclaim and de-power the Necronomicon, Ash immediately encounters bizarre Deadite attacks that are specifically designed to torment him -- including the formation of an evil doppelganger from his own body, Evil Ash. And when he manages to botch the whole thing, the Deadites prepare to storm the castle and take everything over. Life is hard when you're Ash.

Considering that the series started with a serious attempt at horror, it's a little odd that ""Army of Darkness"" mostly drops the horror. Of course, there's still some gloriously gross moments (the emergence of Evil Ash, and his decaying face a few scenes later), but most of the movie is played for laughs (including a long sequence where Ash is assaulted by a small army of Lilliputian doppelgangers, who jab him in the butt with a fork and tie him to the floor). Even the grosser moments are played for laughs (""Good. Bad. I'm the guy with the gun"").

And that's what makes this whole movie so gloriously entertaining -- it's gross, nasty and violent, but it's presented with the gleeful joy that comes with a cavalcade of one-liners and memetastic moments (""All right, you primitive screwheads, listen up... this... is my BOOMSTICK!""). Nothing is presented very seriously, because... well, how can you take this seriously? It's about a college student/S-Mart employee who gets blasted back in time to fight demonic zombies in a medieval setting. The cheese is thick and gloriously unserious, climaxing as Ash careens through the titular army in a massive armored steampunk-car/tank that easily hacks them apart.

And despite the much larger cast and more extensive sets and special effects required, somehow Raimi maintains that rough, low-budget feel -- the stop-motion, tiny Ashes, and especially the battle sequences that are clearly against inanimate Halloween skeletons. It still feels like a cheesy low-budget movie that does NOT care

Bruce Campbell is at the absolute height of his Campbellitude here -- he gives a delightfully hammy performance as a gun-toting, one-liner-spouting Ash. He plays the kind of guy that every guy likes to think he'd be in such a crisis, uttering don't-give-a-dang one-liners, shooting monsters and smooching a wench with extremely good teeth with great relish. And he gives an equally quotable (""Little goody two-shoes!"") performance as the Evil Ash, who is just as snarky but... well, his face is rotting off. The supporting actors give good performances, especially Abercrombie as the wise man that nobody ever seems to actually listen to, but this is clearly the Campbell show here.

So what sets the collector's edition apart from other versions of the story? Well, it contains multiple cuts: the original R-rated theatrical cut (the kind you're most likely to have seen), the director's cut (which contains many scenes that didn't make it in, including the original not-approved-by-test-screenings ending and a sex scene), the international cut (which has a lot of stuff missing) and the TV cut are all included, with a trove of making-of and behind-the-scenes material like photos, featurettes, interviews, commentary with Raimi and Campbell, and even deleted/alternate footage. In short, the only way they could have a more complete version of ""Army of Darkness"" is if it came with a tiny Ash pinned to the box.

It may have effectively left horror behind, but ""Army of Darkness"" instead embraces a gloriously gross brand of comedy, with knights, skeletons, bagpipes and one S-Mart employee with a boomstick and a robot hand. It's hard to find a movie more resolutely fun than this.",1461456000,,4932,5.056580565805658

6680249,3,B00NU6CP0Y,"I have lost track how many times this movie has been double dipped over the now more than two decades since its initial theatrical release. What you get here is the theatrical version, an international version and a slightly extended version. I would have to say that so far I feel this is the most cohesive release but recycling a lot of the same extras from previous releases. As for the movie, Bruce Campbell is still terrific as Ashe and the movie moves at a pretty break neck pace. What kind of sucks now are the dated not so special effects with the stop motion skeletons and rubber-faced bat demon. The one liners still hold up but some of the slapstick now seems out of place and purely ridiculous like the scene where Ashe is inside the windmill facing down Gullivers Travels style a bunch of mini versions of himself. Not much more to say here other than that if you are a fan and don't have an army of darkness blu ray then grab this one otherwise skip it since it has a lot of what past versions included.",1460246400,2,1017,4.3578947368421055

Great picture and sound on the two main versions though not so fine on the longest TV broadcast edition. But you can take your choice.
There are numerous extras including the quite recent 'making of'.

A cult classic from a distinguished director - Sam Rami.

the theatrical version - 81 minutes
the directors cut - 96 minutes
the International cut - 88 minutes
the television cut - 90 minutes
It also comes with an abundance of extras.

Excellent Movie I have seen the theatrical version & the directors version. It is good to see the directors version included in Dvd box sets. The directors version is usually the way directors intended the movie to be screened on the big screen.

Movies are art form, they need time to evolve and many movies age over time. The Movie Executives need to acknowledge and realise that movies are a important art form. Original stories are critical to help preserve this essential this art form, writers need to be acknowledged and paid accordingly. The Executives in the movie industry need to focus on long term profit and forget about this short term profit mentality.

Looking forward to the series Ash vs Evil Dead.

Universal wouldn't of bothered making any effort to bring this film to blu-ray
and 4 Different versions of it aswell which is a surprise to me
i knew there was the Theatrical version which i've seen once many years ago and i didn't like it
mainly cause it wasn't Sam raimi's vision of the film, Universal had the final say of the Theatrical version
lots of scenes were cut out
and i knew of the Directors cut by Sam raimi himself which has about 15mins of extra footage inserted back in
the extra scenes that Universal edited from the Theatrical version.
the new HD transfer for the Directors cut does look excellent very nice sharp & clear picture quality, hardly no grain or Dirt
much better quality than the very old Anchor bay version

apparently the HD transfer for the international cut is 4k scan well i compared this to the Directors cut version
and the picture quality looks very similar i can't really tell the Difference
the sound quality for the Int' cut is the same 5.1 master mix
and 1 more version the TV version which must've been broadcast to U.S. TV sometime in the 90's
the TV version which is 90mins is only a Digital remaster transfer in 1:33:1 ratio
the picture quality is Good, not excellent but watchable.

6680295,4,B00NU6CP0Y,"I've had the opportunity to watch all versions of the movie included in this collection. The Theatrical Cut looks great but pretty much identical to the ""Screwhead"" edition. Some footage that is inter-cut into the Director's Cut definitely has some very noticeable excessive grain and film scratches. These added shots are very obvious and tend to be only a few seconds in length. It's a bit disappointing but, it doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the movie. The Director's Cut is also the only film that contains a commentary track. The International Cut looks the nicest out of the three HD versions. Vivid colors and crisp clarity. The TV cut is tacked on to the disc like an afterthought, looks poor and is in standard definition full-frame as expected.  It has no chapter options so you must fast forward and rewind manually, which isn't the greatest but a welcome bonus. A minor complaint is that the bonus material should have been relegated to it's own extra disc, as it's a bit of a pain to keep switching out discs. Also, to confirm, the glitches are as mentioned.

6680296,5,B00NU6CP0Y,"If you're buying the Scream Factory Collector's Edition of AoD, you probably already know and love the movie. What you may not know however, is the differences between the versions. While I'm not going to sit here and describe in detail what the differences of each version are (you can see that here [...]) I will tell you that the version of the film you really should be watching is the theatrical version.

This may seem like an odd choice, especially since normally the unrated or Director's Cut of movies generally is the better version, but in this case it just didn't work and I will tell you why. First of all if you are watching the scene where Good Ash shoots Bad Ash in the face and wondering where the famous line ""Good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun"" is, thats because it was scrapped in the Director's Cut (for whatever reason) for a less impressive piece of dialogue.

Secondly not only is the DC's ending no longer relevant with the release of Ash vs Evil Dead, but one of the best lines in the whole film is missing! At the end of the movie in the ""S-Mart"" Bruce delivers the ""Hail to the king baby"" line.

6680298,4,B00NU6CP0Y,"I think my buddy and I must have watched this movie 200 times when we were in high school.  Almost every night at some point Army of Darkness found its way into the VCR (no, sadly that wasn't a typo, I'm unfortunately that old), usually followed by either Unforgiven or The Outlaw Josey Wales, but they're not being reviewed here so I'll not go into the details of how full of awesomeness those are.  I think we managed to annoy more chicks with this movie than we ever did with our vulgar, sarcastic senses of humor and general childishness, since they were often subjected to our nightly viewings also and were generally ignored in the process. I won't go into a synopsis since I also stopped writing book reports in high school and you lucky readers can probably find one in most of the other reviews. I'll just say that the movie is hilarious in a silly, childish way that generally doesn't appeal to me, but in this case I absolutely love it. It's one of those films that I truly never get tired of watching and it amazingly doesn't lose any of its laugh a minuteness with repeated viewings. I remember the first time I watched it that I laughed so hard and so long that my face actually hurt. I watched both Evil Dead movies after seeing this and though I haven't seen either since, I remember not liking them nearly as much as Army of Darkness. So if your holding off watching this because you saw either of those and didn't like them, do yourself a favor and get past that prejudice post haste and watch this film.

6680301,4,B00NU6CP0Y,"I'm waiting delivery of my copy of this edition. The 4-star rating is based on some reviews I've read AND of the film itself. I did see this October 24, 2015 review from Blu-ray.com:

For those who were less than pleased with the problematic Screwhead Edition from Universal, most if not quite all of the issues with that version have been addressed on this new release, but there is at least one new anomaly on one of the versions in this set which Shout! has commendably been quick to address. That (admittedly) small glitch occurs at circa 28:00 in the Theatrical Version, where a second or two of footage of Ash jumping over a small stone wall is missing, between Ash tumbling down a hill and a wide shot of him running panicked toward a windmill, leading to a very brief audio sync issue. Shout! has already announced that replacement discs alleviating this issue will be in the pipeline and delivered to consumers in November. (You can see the missing snippet at circa 29:53 in the Director's Cut and at circa 30:05 in the International Cut.)

Has anyone who was seen the theatrical version of this edition noticed this glitch?

UPDATE: I received and watched the theatrical version. I could not perceive any discontinuity between the sound and image of the film at the time of or after the very brief skipped footage takes place. But I'm not an audio expert, either. Anyway, the rest of the movie played just fine, and it looked and sounded great. Once I view the other versions, I may up my star rating if all goes well.",1445904000,5,1528,4.589743589743589

6680303,5,B00NU6CP0Y,"It appears that the issue with the faulty discs have been resolved by Shout for this set.

Groovy. Ash found life at ""S"" Mart a little more challenging than he originally would have thought. That's assuming, of course, that Ash HAD a thought.

We get four different versions of the film on three discs with a variety of special features. Three of the four look from exceptional to very good and the last looks at least decent (but is presented in SD). You can pick which version appeals to you.

The third part of the ""Evil Dead trilogy"" gets the ultimate Blu-ray edition. This three disc set includes ALL the cuts of the film. Disc One includes the theatrical version of the film.

Image and Sound Quality: The transfer here is quite nice. The compression issues that have marred some Shout Factory releases aren't as apparent here. There are occasional bits of crush but, on the whole, this looks quite in for all three versions of the movie with the high def transfers. Originally when I saw the theatrical version, I thought it might have used the same transfer as the Universal. In comparing the two it appears I was initially mistaken--many of the digital flaws on the Universal disc aren't evident on this new transfer. It looks pretty nice.

As with all the other versions the image quality varies quite a bit depending on whether or not there post production visual effects.

The fourth version (the TV cut) is in SD and looks like it was sourced from videotape. Again, not awful but it can't possibly compare to the other three versions. Of the three, the ""International Cut"" looks the best here.

Sound is quite nice for all three with the fourth the SD TV version trailing far behind the first three versions.

Extras on this disc include current interviews with Bruce Campbell, Patricia Tallman (who did many of the female stunts in the film), Ted Raimi, Bill Moseley and others. We also get the original opening and ending for the film, deleted scenes, promos, U.S. theatrical trailer and TV spots.

Disc two is an unrated director's cut. It's a little bit longer and just a tiny bit softer looking in high def. The aspect ratio is also different--the original film is in 1.85:1 while this one is 1.78:1. Colors look better than previous versions.

This features an audio commentary with Campbell, director Sam Raimi and his brother co-writer Ivan. We also get the""Creating The Deadites"" featurette, extended vintage interview clips, behind the scenes footage from KNB Effects.and a vintage featurette on the film.

The third disc featurets the international cut of the film from a new 4K scan. in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio. The TV version is also included as an extra here. (in 1.33:1). The TV version is in SD. The international theatrical trailer and still galleries.

So there's four versions of the film and you can choose the one you first saw.

As usual, Shout provides a two side cover--one which features the image from the original theatrical trailer and a new one specially commissioned for this set.

This is the best it could possibly get for fans of the film. Recommended.",1444521600,50,3096,4.751865671641791

The final film in my all time favorite trilogy, yes you read that right my FAVORITE trilogy ever, of all time. The Evil Dead films are some of the greatest movies ever made and they surpass the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings films for me as the best trilogy ever. I understand anybody who loves those other choices or any other over these, sure I get it but for me there is none greater. Horror movies and B movies just appeal to me and this series is the best of both worlds.

After one of the worst nights of Ashs [Bruce Campbell] life he is transported back in time thanks to the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis. He is sent to medieval times were he is immediately captured by Lord Arthur believed to be a member of Henry the Reds men. Once back at Arthurs castle he is thrown into a pit to be killed by a captured Deadite. Things don't go as planned for Arthur as Ash kills the creature and then is given back his weapons as the Wise Man says Ash is the chosen one. From there Ash is told that he must journey to a cemetery that holds the Evil Book known as the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis. If he speaks the three words correctly he can bring the book back and be sent back home to his own time.

So Ash is off on his quest for the book, but being who he is things do not go as planned. In fact he is the direct cause of all the bad that is coming for all those he is supposed to help. It turns out after encountering small versions of himself an even more dangerous [and taller] version of him is leading an Army of Darkness straight for Ash and Arthurs castle. Now the battle is on, can Ash save those he put in harms way and make it back home?

This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time and also one of the most fun ever made. The film is hilarious as Bruce Campbell does an amazing job as Ash. If you really look at it from the previous films he has gone from one of the most loving and easy going guys ever into a complete jerk all in one night. I guess facing off with demons and losing your possessed hand will do that to you. It is because of that that Bruce is able to deliver some of the best one liners and dialogue ever for the hero of a movie. He cracks me up every time I watch this movie and I am talking every time from 1992 and on. That barn line is excellent, she should have closed the door I guess.

Campbell is amazing as Ash here in a trilogy that went from Horror to comedy to adventure with all three styles working wonderfully together here. Writers Sam and Ivan Raimi created one of the greatest movies of all time wit Sam at the helm of all three flicks as director. Along with producer Rob Tapert these guys gave the world an amazing film and one of the most fun experiences that anyone could ask for. From the story to the dialogue to the effects from the great KNB team everything is wonderfully done here.

I could go on all day about how much I love this film but I am sure those reading this know about it. So I will go into what you get here on the Scream Factory Collectors Edition. This is indeed the collection to get  as you get all four cuts of the film, yes all four versions of the flick. Here you can watch the Theatrical, Directors, International and even Television cuts of the movie, and all four are fun for different reasons.

You also get all of the  behind the scenes, making of, trailers, deleted scenes, original opening and ending, T.V. spots, video promo and still galleries among other things. Of course there is the commentary from Bruce, Sam and Ivan that we all know and love but there is something new and special for this release, a feature length documentary on the making of this film. This doc is called Medieval Times: The Making of Army of Darkness which features all new interviews and footage with Bruce and the great Ted Raimi who played four to five different characters in the film not including all the voices he did for Deadites. This is one of the best documentaries I have seen from this company, right up there with the same thing they did for The Return of the Living Dead.

This is one of the best releases that Scream Factory has put out and definitely the best release for Army of Darkness. I highly recommend this Blu-Ray three disc set for any fan of this film or anyone involved. One of my all time favorite films and the third film in my favorite trilogy. I think I am going to watch it again, hail to the king baby.",1520294400,,4418,4.174882629107981
