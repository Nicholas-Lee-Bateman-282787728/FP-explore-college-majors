5062706,5,B0077PTX54,I thought this was a good show and I bought it for a reasonable price of $5. I thought that Christina Applegate did a great job acting in this...but I bought it because Melissa McCarthy is in it and I think she is a great actor. She is very funny and she looks like an everyday woman.,1392422400,,284,4.0
5062707,5,B0077PTX54,"Christina Applegate is so great in the show. But back to about the DVD. The discs are in great condition, and the case makes it so you don't have to worry about the case banging your DVDs around.",1382054400,,195,4.157894736842105

8512060,5,B0077PTX54,"God I love this TV show, and it kills me that it got cancelled so quickly and it's not even its fault.
The channel wanted to see which shows are people really watching, so they switched up their line up to see if their reality singing competition was causing more people to watch this series just because the show was going to start in thirty minutes or so. So instead of having this okay before or after they changed the day it would play on, and they noticed a big drop in viewing and unfortunately this show was one of the many that soon got the cut.
Such a shame.",1463961600,2,567,4.163636363636364
