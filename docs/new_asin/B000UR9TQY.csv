2924265,5,B000UR9TQY,Our friends in Prague requested this collection--they love American movies in Europe--they loved them--I'm sure they will be requesting others soon.,1239321600,6,148,6.095238095238095
2924266,4,B000UR9TQY,"I bought this as a gift for my son and he said they were very good. They are mostly half hour films, he has a large screen and they showed up well. He liked the variety of subjects.",1232928000,12,181,3.789473684210526
2924287,1,B000UR9TQY,"Although there were some enjoyable pieces, most of the films were cheesy and very poorly done.  It may be necessary to view them on an IMAX screen to appreciate them, but in general these were a waste of time.",1391385600,4,209,4.358974358974359
2924288,5,B000UR9TQY,"This set is a must-have for IMAX fans. The only downside is that I wish there were more nature episodes included, but that's my personal preference. My son lives it; he's a science buff",1388016000,,185,4.470588235294118
2924289,4,B000UR9TQY,"Wow, IMAX lovers will appreciate this collection. There are 20 IMAX films on 20 DVD discs narrated by various celebrities. Be warned that this collection is not in true 3D and the films are not in widescreen format. I enjoy most of these films but they do vary in quality. There isn't much in the way of bonus content.

20 IMAX Films:
1. Space Station, 2. Mission to Mir, 3. Blue Planet, 4. Destiny in Space, 5. Cosmic Voyage, 6. First City in Space, 7. The Dream is Alive, 8. Hail Columbia!, 9. Deep Sea, 10. Into the Deep, 11. Galapagos, 12. Survival Island, 13. Hidden Dimension, 14. Secret of Life on Earth, 15. China: the Panda Adventure, 16. Mountain Gorilla, 17. NASCAR: the IMAX Experience, 18. Mark Twain`s America, 19. Fires of Kuwait, 20. T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous

Buy this collection. For $55 you can't beat the price (but it is now out of print). Blu-ray releases of many IMAX films are also sold separately.",1378944000,,926,4.538922155688622
2924290,3,B000UR9TQY,No question about the beauty of the subjects but it's really like something you would play in the background at a party or for an attentive small child or family.  If you can get your family to sit still and watch then congrats.,1368921600,,228,4.3023255813953485
2924291,3,B000UR9TQY,"I thought they would be widescreen, but they are not. Very disappointing that I have to change the format on my 55"" to view it without the black side bars. Thought IMAX would default in the widescreen format. I guess I can't complain when you get 20 IMAX movies for the price, but will read all the descriptions before I ever order anything like this again",1367798400,,356,4.409090909090909
2924292,5,B000UR9TQY,I am yet to watch all the movies. seen 2 they are mindblowing interms of picture quality and sound. I would recommend this collection to everyone.,1363651200,,146,4.653846153846154
2924293,2,B000UR9TQY,"When I purchased this item I thought the videos were in 3D since I put 3D movies in the search bar.  They are not 3D and with a 60"" wide screen TV all you get is a small block in the middle of the screen where the video is.  Make sure this is what you really want or you will be disappointed like I was.",1362355200,,303,3.646153846153846
2924294,5,B000UR9TQY,"Hard to beat IMAX movies. Great collection. May give it to my grandkids for them to watch.
Great educational movies.",1360972800,,116,4.85
2924295,3,B000UR9TQY,"I have only watched a few of these.  17 out of 20 disc were unopened, so new disc.  The IMAX quality is usually better than I
have thus far seen on the two disc I have watched thus far.  The HD TV format is shrunk down, so a small viewing panel
on my HDTV tv, looking into why?

OK product, not the usual IMAX quality I would expect",1357516800,3,332,3.838235294117647
2924296,3,B000UR9TQY,I did a quick search for 3D movies to check out my new 3D TV and was in too much of a hurry --- I did not read the description closely enough and thought I was getting a 3D set but that was not the case.  OK I was careless and the non-3D was clearly my fault.  The DVDs say the IMAX 70mm picture was reformated to fit the TV --- The format is old fashion and not even wide screen.  The content of the set is good & interesting --- just wish the awesome IMAX format would have been carried forward to make an awesome DVD.,1347321600,19,520,3.8411214953271027
2924307,3,B000UR9TQY,"I love IMAX films, however, these weren't their best and the quality is not very good---sound and picture is below average.  Difficult to hear the narrator in many of the films---also, film is not bright or as clear.  Price was very low but the product was also. Disappointed---maybe purchasing Blu-ray individual copies is best.",1344211200,7,329,5.074074074074074

2924310,2,B000UR9TQY,"There are several DVDs in this collection (~20).  My family and I have only watch about five of the DVDs more than once.  Besides these five DVDs, there were others that were interesting and/or good to watch.  Overall, I don't think that we got the value of our purchase...considering the alternatives.",1308873600,5,302,4.882352941176471

2924313,5,B000UR9TQY,Most IMAX movies/DVD are usually excellent or very good due to the high production cost of making the film.,1268265600,,107,4.684210526315789
2924314,5,B000UR9TQY,"This is a fantastic gift.  The DVD's are wonderful and the price can't be beat.  I ordered one and loved it so much I have bought four more for gifts.  Go for it, this is GREAT!!",1251417600,9,178,3.888888888888889
2924315,5,B000UR9TQY,"First of all, please be patient
with my english writing skill. I am
not from a english speaking country.

I am a great fan of IMAX films.
These collection contains a few of the greatest IMAX movies ever made.
So - if you don't have any of these movies or only a very few...
there's no reason to leave this mega box in the store.
I got my for only 22,99 $ ... unbelievable - this is a 20 film box !!
Normaly you can't get two of the film series for this price.

If you know what IMAX is - be sure , you will be satisfied to watch any of the movies
any time you want. There is only one downer i know :
unfortunally there is no 72 x 53 ft screen in the box .... so ... don't forget
to check out the newest IMAX films in cinema.

Hope this will help
Bye,
Ingo",1251158400,56,755,3.7658227848101267
2924316,4,B000UR9TQY,"Amazon independent sellers sell this for $30; not pay more that this, though. Some of the movies seem like filler movies, although I haven't watched them all yet. Still, for $[30], you end up paying $1.50 a film, which is pretty darn good. And most of these films are very educational and visually stunning.

Also note these films are presented in 4:3 or standard presentation. This is in proportion to the IMAX 70mm film.

All in all, great for the family if you pay the right price for it.",1242950400,35,491,4.50561797752809

8214427,3,B000UR9TQY,"Just in time for the Holidays, selling for $50 at Walmart and Costco, comes this mix of 20 individually packaged films, most averaging 40 minutes each, in a maximum size package, 12"" x 8"" x 6"",  so make sure you have enough shelf space to hold this. While the photography is great in most of these films, the best ones were Cosmic Voyage,  The T-Rex, Galapagos and the 3 nature films. One of the problems with this set is that 8 of the films are about SPACE, and 7 of the SPACE films are so similar, they use a lot of the same shots, views of the Space Station, astronauts floating in free space, the space shuttle landing and taking off and way too many interviews. And then some of the Space films keep using shots that take up only  1/4 of the screen with a black background through quite a deal of the movie, it may look good on an IMAX screen, but it turns a 40"" or 50"" flat screen into a 10"" screen. And some of the films depend too heavily on B/W photographs, like the Mark Twain film and many of the films are filled with interviews and crowd shots. When I first experienced IMAX in the theatres, it was a lot more thrilling and interesting than what is in this package, there were roller coaster rides, great scenic thrills such as flying over rivers and mountains, more like entertainment than just plain documentaries.  There are some good films in this set as I initally noted, yet I would think that most people would have preferred more nature films, films that would appeal to children, it seems as if some of the less popular selling IMAX films were thrown into this set, a better package would have had more variety.
