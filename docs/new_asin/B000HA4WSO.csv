2632483,4,B000HA4WSO,"The Rock Hudson Screen Legend Collection is one of the best I have ever seen all movies are in colour and fully restorded to a brilliant picture and sound as if they were made yesterday. I recommend these movies to any one and what a great price even with the austrailan dollar conversion and postage cost me about $7.00 per movie.

2632484,5,B000HA4WSO,"PLOT SPOILER
Spiral road turned out to be an excellent, thoughtful film. It was too long in obscurity. Hudson plays an ambitious doctor and top competitive athlete who feels utterly self-confident. He is not sympathetic to people who can't handle life without community or for example religion. The film has lush tropical atmosphere in color, but such a view of humanity is the core issue here.

Ives is the crusty old world expert on leprosy who is too busy treating patients and coping with jungle life to publish his stack of research findings. He maintains a tough exterior but gains deep respect and affection for Hudson, that he tries to conceal.

PLOT SPOILER
Toward the remarkable ending Hudson cracks under quite strange but believable psychological pressures. He is being outwitted and starts making dumb mistakes as any human might under such alien circumsances. If you are the sort who thinks YOU wound never ever make such mistakes, forget this film. Anyway he falls apart mentally out alone in the jungle. He has to be rescued. All that saves him is that other human beings who love him more than he loves them have come to care about him. It is implied  that he comes to realize that loving human bonds are not simply weaknesses but are critical to human survival and give meaning to life.

Elsewhere I read that the film is about atheism versus religious belief. The film does involve missionaries who run a leper colony, Hudson's disdain for religion, and it does end with a quote from the Bible, but the overall characterization is misleading. All these elements largely raise issues for the viewer to ponder. For example suppose Hudson's scientific arguments were correct, and the religious position was wrong. So what? -- Apparently what was really important was the love component in religion as it was presented in the film in the context of care for the lepers and the importance of personal bonds among the doctors in tough situations at the edge of survival. I don't know the book, and it is not impossible that the author originally had a different objective, and that Hudson would have found God in the end. But that was not how the film developed the story.

Hudson and others did quite respectable jobs of acting. Some would say he was out of character, but I would say that the film is rather unusual in any event and any famous actor might seem out of character for some viewers. I liked the way he played the role, however. Gratefully, the actors did not overplay and trivialize the points that I just made. I liked the dialogue. There were some nice thought provoking lines.

This is quite simply a thought provoking film -- it is not an action or adventure film. It is not the usual sort of drama. It is not an inspirational religious film about conversion. It is difficult to put it into the usual categories without raising misleading expectations.",1204070400,13,2884,4.758
2632485,5,B000HA4WSO,"It is so good to have five of Rock Hudson's Universal International films in one package. I only hope the studio continues the process and in the near future we will see a package containing This Earth is Mine, A Gathering of Eagles, The Desert Hawk, Seminole and Captain Lightfoot. Hey thats just a start, what about Twilight for the Gods, The Tarnished Angels and Blindfold. All Universal hits. It is a treat to watch these dvds after so many years of not having them available to watch. Quality is pretty good.",1165017600,5,513,4.586956521739131
2632486,5,B000HA4WSO,"Universal is starting to get better with their franchise collection DVDs, including this one, as they are released on single discs with only one to two movies on each. This allows for better quality unlike the dual-sided discs crammed with up to four movies a disc.

While this collection features rare Rock Hudson movies, I must say the entertainment value is well worth the expense. At about 4 or 5 dollars a movie, it's cheaper than a movie ticket. AND YOU GET TO KEEP THEM! With this release also came out similar collections of Cary Grant and Bing Crosby. Unfortunately, there is some technical skipping or stoppage in one of the Cary Grant discs--the only technical malfunction so far as I still have more of the collections to watch. (Skipping and stopping has been an issue with Universals Franchise Collection DVD packaging for awhile now, but slowly it's getting better.)

The packaging is nicely done with some interesting side notes on each film inside the casing. However, there is a misquote on the three films he did with Doris Day (at least in my copy there is). It states the three movies Rock did with Doris were Pillow Talk, Lover Come Back, and <EM>Come September</EM>? The first two are correct, but the latter is suppose to state <EM>Send Me No Flowers</EM>. He did Come September the same year as Send Me No Flowers, but he did it with an italian actress, Gina Lollibrigida as their second movie together.",1164326400,17,1428,4.754032258064516
2632487,5,B000HA4WSO,"Finally, The Spiral Road is available on DVD, and that alone is worth the cost of this collection. Amazon indicated the format was standard and I was prepared to accept that. Thankfully, it was issued in widescreen. I agree this is an obscure title, but an excellent movie. Grab it while you can.",1163980800,36,296,4.60377358490566
2632488,4,B000HA4WSO,"It is great to see Universal release more of Rock Hudson's films to dvd. And thankfully the three discs in this collection are single sided. I thoroughly enjoyed The Spiral Road - a very good drama set in and around Borneo in 1936 and which also stars Burl Ives. Both are doctors and surprised I had never heard of it until now. By the way, three of the films, including Spiral Road, are presented in their OAR of 1:85 ( widescreen )and are Anamorphic. The label on the dvd incorrectly lists Spiral Road as 2:35.

Rock Hudson was a very underappreciated actor in my book.  He deserves a wonderful box set for current and future fans to enjoy.
I can only hope that this set will reflect his diverse talent and not be some cheaply made B-movie set.
Here's hoping for three films that reflect his true acting talent.

2632502,5,B000HA4WSO,"First, the visual quality of these movies is top-notch-clear and strong, vibrant colors. The movies themselves are really fantastic. There is no question Mr. Hudson is a fine actor, and that, with his handsome looks and his warm screen presence make for a wonderful viewing experience. I liked 'Have You Seen My Gal"" and ""The Last Sunset"" the best. Kirk Douglas is really, really good in the later. The story there is more compelling than many Westerns of that era. Rock Hudson is solid. The Spiral Road is very good as well--a wonderful study in human character. Didn't love A Very Special Favor, because it is similar to the movies Rock did with Doris Day and she is much better that Ms. Charon in playing a comic role. But, it was written well and the story flowed well--Miss Charon just didn't do it for me. The Golden Blade was fun, but really chessey fun to be sure.  The sets and costumes left a bit to be desired, but Rock's performance was solid and his female co-star was interesting to watch.  All other parts were not so great. It's a good story so it was watchable. Have you seen my Gal was special. The sets were top-notch, the filming was beautiful and each character in the movie was appealing. The acting throughout was very good. The story of rags to riches and how it affects people was handled very believably and it kept one very interested to the end. Very uplifting Americana scenes and situations. Just fantastically charming throughout. Rock doesn't get the most screen time but he is very good--the older, wealthy man is great. I bought this set for $7!!! Five very well made movies, all with great, interesting and moral-laden stories. Amazing.",1430784000,2,1671,4.680272108843537

I bought the set, which was a bargain, because of HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY GAL, that one was fun along with THE GOLDEN BLADE.  However, I found A VERY SPECIAL FAVOR  to be an inane sex comedy.  To be frank I hated it.  The print was gorgeous and the cast was exceptional but this ""sex comedy"" turned me off.  Universal was running out of steam after the success of the Doris Day-Rock Hudson comedies.  Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid and unbelievable dud comedy. I could not get through the entire film, and this is the first time this has happened with my  purchase of any DVD  movie..

And now that I've finished reading Rock Hudson's biography, it goes to show you just how brilliant & gifted of an actor he was! He has amazing screen presence in each of these films!  I highly recommend.

I'm really glad to have gotten this from Amazon! From growing up in the `80's, I've never seen these movies before or even gotten into watching movies from this era but wow, they just don't make them like this anymore. And by that I mean movies and their stars.  I hope Hollywood can somehow bring back the glamor, elegance, sophistication, style & grace that the stars of the `50's had.

I had read the book and found this movie unusually good at picking up the highlights of the novel.

Rock Hudson is a tremendous Dr. Drager: young, arrogant, conceited and presumptive; he gets brought down by an ""ignorant"" witch doctor with a diabolical  understanding of human nature. Science trumped by superstition! Also, this movie is closed-captioned, a rarity for movies of this era and very collectable for more reasons than one.",1344384000,4,646,5.02803738317757

The young Rock Hudson and Piper Laurie dancing the Charleston are fun.  You'll see the old raccoon coats popular among the college set at that time.  And be sure to catch young James Dean at the soda fountain (uncredited).

2632536,5,B000HA4WSO,"..... A Cowboy Movie I'd seen a couple times on Late Night Television when I was a Kid, and it is my all time favorite Western and Kirk Douglas film .. and Yes! that includes ""Lonely Are the Brave"". It was Directed by Robert Aldrich (Flight of the Phoenix and The Dirty Dozen) with a script by Dalton Trumbo, it also Stars Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone, Joseph Cotton. Carol Lynley (smokin'hot), Jack Elam and Neville Brand.
  If you wonder why I site this as a ""Kirk Douglas Movie"" it's because he has the Lead Role of Brenden O'Malley, a Wild at Heart drifter who seeks to regain the Heart of Belle, played by Dorothy Malone, who now lives in Mexico with her Cattle Rancher Husband (Joseph Cotton), Hot on O'Malley's trail is Rock Hudson, a US Marshal who plans to take O'Malley back to Texas to Stand Trial for Murdering his Brother-In-Law. Both men take jobs with the Rancher in moving the Cattle to Texas, on the Drive they experience Action, Drama and Romance! all with the anticipation of what will happen when they reach Texas, the ending does not disappoint!
  Until this Collection was released, the only option for this movie were outragously priced VHS Copies. The print offered on this collection is absolutely Beautiful, the color is magnificent and the sound is clear, my only complaint is there is no Scene Selection, but then, this film should only be watched in it's entirty! I'm thrilled to finally be able to see this again 40 years later, I plan on watching the other films soon, but I purchased this collection for The Last Sunset.",1307836800,3,1551,4.629090909090909

2632538,5,B000HA4WSO,"The Spiral Road was one of my favorite movies when I was high school and college. It wasn't a ""popular"" or terribly huge box office success, but the theme is wonderful, and I believe it remains one of Rock Hudson's absolute best performances. It's theme is we all need each other, and we need God. The scene that just brings sobs to me every time I see it - is the ""Aha"" moment, where Dr. Anton Drager comes to a realization that he does need help. If you read Daniel 4 in the Bible, you'll see a close parallel between King Nebuchadnezzar and Dr. Anton Drager. Thankfully, Dr. Drager doesn't spend seven years as a madman, maybe only a few weeks. But the outcome is the same.

The moments are very powerful and the cast is terrific. You have the beautiful Gena Rowlands as Else, the love of Anton's life, ""Honeylamb"" according to Dr. Brits Jensen, the foremost expert on leprosy. He is wonderfully played by Burl Ives, who can go from very serious to very humorous and back again in the course of the movie. There are many other notable performances in the film as well, in smaller parts. The witchdoctor you'll recognize as the assassin from ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (Doris Day and James Stewart version). He is appropriately creepy.

One of my favorite characters was the long-suffering, yet non-judgmental and humble Dr. Willem Waters of the Salvation Army. He responds well to persecution and mockery. He took responsibility for any quarrels, even though they weren't his fault. I totally appreciated that as an example of what real humility looks like.

I did watch The Golden Blade, A Very Special Favor, and Has Anybody Seen My Gal. They're OK. I really liked Has Anybody Seen My Gal, and I thought The Golden Blade was a lark.

But I bought this because it is the only place you can get The Spiral Road. That movie has the best message, the best cast, and I believe will linger long with you after you see it. It's been nearly 40 years since I saw it the first time - and I was so thrilled to be able to get it on DVD.",1272240000,5,2030,4.434316353887399
2632539,4,B000HA4WSO,"Rock Hudson fans probably won't care whether any movie he's in is good or bad; they just want to drool over his hunkiness.
Somebody at the studio decided to put Hudson in a costume pic and ""The Golden Blade"" was the sad result. He tried, but had nothing to work with.
""Has Anybody Seen My Gal"" is a vehicle for Charles Coburn, and Rock doesn't have a big role.  ""A Very Special Favor"" doesn't do anybody a favor.  It's a mishmash that can't make up its mind whether it's a comedy, a romance or just something to give Hudson, Leslie Caron and Charles Boyer (as Caron's father) something to do while the cameras are rolling.

But  ""The Last Sunset"" and ""The Spiral Road"" are worth the price, especially the latter.

In ""Last Sunset"" Hudson does an interesting, well-reined-in job in a John Wayne-type role, and he and Kirk Douglas manage to retain the viewer's interest in this somewhat different Western.  Dorothy Malone and Carol Lynley hold up their end of the film.  All in all, it makes one wish Hudson had done more roles of this type; he might have picked up where John Wayne left off.

Not everyone will like ""The Spiral Road"" but those who do will find it a gem.  It's a magnificently filmed adaptation of Jan de Hartog's novel about an atheistic Dutch doctor (Hudson) in the pre-WW II East Indies.  Gena Rowlands is believable as the love interest, and Burl Ives darn near runs away with the film as a crusty old doctor who's an expert in leprosy.

It's another of those films that make one realize that had Hudson been given more good roles, he could've set the world on fire with his acting, instead of his good looks.  But one can't totally blame the studio; legend has it that Hudson turned down ""Ben Hur,"" ""Bridges at Toko-Ri"" and ""Sayonara.""

According to the late Hollywood columnist Shirley Eder, Hudson wanted to buy ""The Rosary Murders,"" but the agent had sold it two weeks earlier.  Mystery buffs may entertain themselves imagining Hudson as William Kienzle's priest-detective, Father Koesler, eventually played by Donald Sutherland.",1267660800,5,2052,4.695530726256983

2632541,5,B000HA4WSO,"I am a Rock Hudson fan, and I enjoyed these movies, I had never seen any of these movies before!
I remember seeing Rock Hudson on TV for the first time, when I was a very young little girl, watching a Rock Hudson movie on TV, with my parents, and I thought that he was the most handsome man in the world! I think that he was the first handsome man, that I'd ever seen! Rock Hudson is one good looking, beautiful man! Wow! He is my all-time favorite handsome leading man, and  to this day, I have not seen anyone out do Rock!

In this movie collection HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY GAL, is a very good movie, it gives you a idea of how it was with the roaring 20's, college era, and about people who have money, and the people who don't! I loved the funny, old man who was the secret, rich, millionare! I enjoyed it!

And my favorite was THE GOLDEN BLADE, I just loved it, and I loved the chemisty between Rock Hudson, and Piper Laurie, who played the beautiful princess! This movie I will watch again, it is your classic romantic, love story, with your dashing handsome hero(Rock Hudson), that saves the princess, and her kingdom!

The movie A VERY SPECIAL FAVOR, reminded me of some of Rock Hudson's movies with Doris Day, but in this movie Leslie Caron was the leading lady, and of course Rock was your handsome playboy! I loved the man who was the matchmaking father, who was trying to fix up his beautiful daughter, with Rock!

I just loved this movie THE LAST SUNSET! Kirk Douglas was the handsome outlaw, and Rock Hudson was the handsome cowboy hero! Wow! Rock Hudson as a cowboy! My favorite scene in the movie was when Rock Hudson moved the wagon to point to the north star, so that he could seek the attentions of the pretty widow Belle, who was in the wagon.

 But the movie that touched my heart was THE SPIRAL ROAD, I love Burl Ives ,he is always one of my favorite actors, he is simply outstanding! No one can out do Burl! But Rock Hudson surprised me in this film, he show me that he was more than a handsome leading man, he showed me what a outstanding, talented man he really was, in the scene where he gets lost in the jungle, standing in the water, with tears in his eyes touching his reflection in the water, and realizing that it was his reflection in the water, staring back at him, that scene was awesome! I loved this movie collection, and I highly recommend it! And I will watch these movies again!",1240444800,15,2412,4.287912087912088
