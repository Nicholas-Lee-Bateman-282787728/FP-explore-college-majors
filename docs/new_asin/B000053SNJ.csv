7930256,5,B000053SNJ,"I was born in 1948 and I believe that the last of the serials was shown in the theaters around 1954. Being so young, I never saw any of them in the theaters. However my parents saw them in the theaters as they were growing up and they told me about them. Also, there was a week day 5pm movie on one of our local channels back in the 50's and every once in a while they would show a chapter of a serial as filler in the allotted time slot if the movie ended early. That was my exposure to serials and I loved them.
I have a massive movie library and many, many serials. I recently purchased ""Junior G Men Of The Air"" and I must say that its fantastic. Both the picture and sound quality are excellent thanks to the work of VCI for preserving them. The story line and action in this serial is right up there. Even the cover art on the box is great.
This serial was made sometime during World War Two during the early days of the war when it wasn't going that well for America. I couldn't help but notice the patriotic ""can do"" message that was throughout this serial. To me it also seemed to convey an everything will be alright message to the children of America which at that time were huge fans of the serials. Major studios such as Universal and Columbia made serials but the very best serials were made by Republic Pictures. In any case, all serials were great and a fantastic time be you a kid or an adult",1477094400,,1409,4.145985401459854

7930259,5,B000053SNJ,"VCI Entertainment and Universal Pictures present ""JUNIOR G-MEN OF THE AIR"" (1942) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Serials, more specifically known as Movie serials or Film serials, were short subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film --- Known as ""chapter plays,"" they were extended motion pictures broken into a number of segments called ""chapters"" or ""episodes."" --- Each chapter (a typical serial usually had as many as 15 of them) would be screened at the same theater for one week --- The serial would end with a cliffhanger, as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the latest perilous situation from which there could be no escape --- The audience would have to return the next week (and pay admission) to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and battle the villain once again --- Serials were especially popular with children, and for many youths in the first half of the 20th century, a typical Saturday at the movies included a chapter of at least one serial, along with animated cartoons, newsreels, and two feature films.

The Movie studios of Universal, Columbia and Republic, with Republic quickly becoming the acknowledged leader in quality serial product --- Each company turned out four to five serials per year, of 12 to 15 episodes each, a pace which they all kept up until the end of World War II when, in 1946, Universal dropped its serial unit along with its B-picture unit and renamed its production department Universal-International Pictures -- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

7930261,4,B000053SNJ,"Okay, this version of the conflict between G men and the Black Dragon society might not have the great chapter endings or the raven or the super weapons in ""G Men Versus the Black Dragon"", but I couldn't help liking it anyway.  You have thwe antics of the East Side Kids...no Leo Gorcey, but the rest are all there.  You have Lionel Atwill as the Japanese villain with a rather german accent.  You have the secret entrance to the hideout in a haystack.  You have shots where the shadows cast by the staircase resemble the rising sun symbol associated with the Japanese during the second world war.  You have allusions to history in touches like the Japanese merchant (a cover, of course, for the Black Dragon Society) closing their doors on December 7, 1941.  I guess I can't call this one of the great serials, but what the heck, I really enjoyed it and recommend it.",984960000,8,868,4.532051282051282
