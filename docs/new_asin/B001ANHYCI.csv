8278114,5,B001ANHYCI,"The Strangest Cartoons Ever Made is indeed a weird show for the most part. There is one that is weird not in content but due to the fact that it was made for a whiskey company.  The Peanut Vendor would prob scare the dickens out of a young kid!  It is not a cartoon so much as a 'puppet' of sorts. If you have a taste for the odd or unusual you will love this weird and old cartoons.  Their age is part of their charm. One of the cartoons which is French and called Joi de Verve is very unusual; please don't ask me what it is about!  We see two girls dancing and prancing around what appears to be an electric company! Their dresses are constantly flying around and at one point very, very briefly we see a breast!  If you are not watching closely you won't even see it. By cartoons end they are prancing around a train station. All very strange for a cartoon made in 1934. If you have a taste for the odd and unusual I highly recommend this collection.",1407024000,,954,4.10752688172043
8278115,5,B001ANHYCI,"This is a great DVD from thunderbean! The videos are mostly in good quality,but Monkeydoodle's sound is pretty bad-the rest is good though. All of the cartoons are weird and are hard to explain(just TRY to explain Monkeydoodle,One Man Dog,The Kangaroo Kid,or Old Manor House!).It's all good cartoons,though. Here's a simple rundown of the contents

Monkeydoodle-??? sound dissapears randomly at some points
Is My Palm Red-surreal BETTY BOOP
Gypped in Egypt-hilariously random waffles and don
Old Manor House-???
The Case of The Kangaroo Kid-??????????????
The Peanut Vendor-kinda creepy stop motion experiment
The Fatal Note-weird little king
Sniffy Escapes Poisoning-unintentionaly hilarious PSA film where a boy with an oversized head tries to cure his dogs sickness,but the medicine starts SINGING.
Johnnie and The DK Robot-weird live action/animated educational film
PM Picnic-who's idea was it to have superdupercute woodland critters advertising for HARD LIQUOR?
Joi De Vivre-surreal,yet highly stylized art noveau
Candytown-two cats go on the moon and are chased by a can of castor oil and a spoon.(hey that rhymes!)
One Man Dog-???
The Snowman-great film with a cute eskimo and his animal freinds build a happy snowman...until it comes to life and terrorizes them!

Overall i think that you should buy this great DVD.",1389744000,3,1325,5.490196078431373
8278116,5,B001ANHYCI,"After reading the response from the creator of this collection, I can only praise him for his forthrightness. It is very hard to find proper copies of original film...remember the poor sap who without knowledge, erased years of Johnny Carson, to reclaim tape that for the most part, was used for forgettable fair? Most collections of this type are created from easily accessed terrible copyright office copies. These guys accessed real prints and internegs to at least try to get it right. As a recently retired optical camera operator at a major Hollywood film laboratory, I can attest to the treatment of aspect ratios reduced to ""pan and scan"" or worse. We must be thankful some of these treasures exist at all!",1389398400,4,714,4.860655737704918
8278117,5,B001ANHYCI,Excellent collection that lives up to its name! Thunderbean once again has put together a wonderful collection of vintage animation!,1358294400,,132,5.65
8278118,4,B001ANHYCI,"The video quality of the cartoons are in my opinion, very good considering that these graphics are almost 80 years old. The sound is also OK with same consideration. There is a frame though, in the first feature that the sound just disappears and that could be somewhat frustrating but again, these cartoons are almost 80 years old! As for what is selling, these are indeed some strange cartoons! One gets what is sold here. Overall is worth the price and I would recommend it.",1284768000,3,477,4.623529411764705
8278119,5,B001ANHYCI,"Great curios of the cartoon world.  Be warned, though, some of these cartoons are of dubious quality, and many of them don't make any sense.  That's part of the reason why they're so charming!  I particularly enjoyed Sniffy Escapes Poisoning, a PSA cautioning children against using pharmaceuticals in which pills sing and dance.  Joi De Vivre was a real surprise on the compilation.  This beautiful and surreal short is a also great example of art nouveau.  Highly recommended to anyone interested in animation history!",1245542400,33,520,5.130952380952381
