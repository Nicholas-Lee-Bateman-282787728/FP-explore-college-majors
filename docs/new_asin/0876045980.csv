7793305,3,0876045980,"Reddy's Hypnotherapy sounds a bit shaky, as if it's part and parcel of some New Age phenomenon - I'm always amazed how ""subjects"", maybe better described as ""patients"" always manage to meet some Historical figure. In one case presented here, guess who the individual met? Well, a hint is, he was around about 2010 years ago.
She speaks very conclusively about how a connection can be made with a past life or lives and this explains why someone gets headaches.
Much more convincing is her biographical notes, beautifully expressed; quite humble and often funny. Her experience with shall we say, the paranormal is fairly compelling. Although something about a license plate containing the same phrase about which she meditated at the beach, well....
A big selling point is her obvious, absolute belief in her new ""career"". She really wants to help people and when she sees the fruits of her labors, she is overwhelmed with joy and resolution.
The presentation is made at an Edgar Cayce center, in an apparently small auditorium. Helen is videoed mostly at stage left; there's a vacant chair to her left - which is featured as much as the speaker. The viewer waits for a section where someone from the audience gets ""regressed"" right before our eyes.
For Helen Reddy fans who want to really *see* Helen Reddy, she's stuck behind a podium, so for those who want to see the sensuous star top to bottom, forget it.
Why the Producer couldn't photograph her head to toe with a boom or handmike, I cannot fathom.
Interesting kickoff to the speech on the ""non-physical"" world. She mentions a very satisfying afternoon massage and facial. No humorous sequeway.",1265673600,2,1651,4.879003558718861
