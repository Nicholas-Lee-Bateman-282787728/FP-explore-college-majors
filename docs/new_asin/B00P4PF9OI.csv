8686387,2,B00P4PF9OI,"This film  is a biopic of Jean Harlow from her first screen test to her death. Considering the subject matter, this could have been a great movie. However, its a bad movie. Production values are zero. Acting is subpar. If you choose to watch this movie, be prepared to cringe a lot.",1513728000,,282,4.423076923076923
