6246264,2,B00I0VTOMG,"I do not recommend this for younger kids.  I got this for my 2 year old as he really enjoys Claymation on some of the videos we've seen on Netflix and he loves chickens and what a great price on three I thought!  I put in Chicken run and the picture was kind of dark not colorful at all and it was too much of  story line and not a lot of action, he didn't pay a bit of attention to it.  To be honest, even as an adult it didn't really draw me in.  I read a lot of reviews about this that said it was funny and a great picture, but I just don't see what they were talking about honestly.  We put it in once and now it's in the back of our dvd shelf with the videos that we don't watch.  I honestly didn't even give the other two a chance after what a disappointment chicken run was.",1426032000,2,782,3.7901234567901234

6246268,3,B00I0VTOMG,"I've been watching Aardman films since I was very young, and Chicken Run remains one of my favorite movies. They arrived very quickly, and I watched all of them in one day. The Curse of the Were-Rabbit and Chicken Run played fine, but Flushed Away skipped a tiny bit in the middle, then played smoothly again until the end, where it skipped over the whole final conflict to the very last scene. Upon closer inspection, there was a big scratch in a circle all around the disk. Very upset by that. Otherwise, it was a great price for three good films.",1411948800,5,549,4.445544554455446

Clay Animator Extraordinaire, Nick Park, has done it again (well, twice actually, Flushed Away is computer animated, but with Nick Park's character design behind it)!

8638096,5,B00I0VTOMG,"I had seen Chicken Run before but not the other 2 and I must say this 3-pack is about as good a deal as you are ever going to get. I love all 3 of these movies. I had never heard of Flushed Away and after watching it read the wikipedia page and saw it got so so reviews and while it made $160 million it cost $150 million to make and ended Aardman's relationship with Dreamworks. I thought it was great: funny, interesting characters with real personalities, excellent voice acting, and it MOVED! Never a dull moment. Curse of the Were-Rabbit is a Wallace and Gromit movie and if you are a fan of Nick Park and his other movies you will love it, I sure did. Chicken Run is another winner, I just do not see how anyone could dislike it. Were-Rabbit and Chicken Run are claymation and Flushed Away is CGI. I cannot recommend this package enough, it's for everyone and certainly is perfect family viewing. Let me just add: if you have many DVD's and are not keen on buying Blu rays to upgrade the quality now that we are in the 4K era, get a UHD Blu ray player. The quality of the upconversion with a UHD is simply amazing and light-years better than a standard Blu ray player. Especially with CGI movies. I got my Sony for $150 and now see no reason to spend a fortune upgrading to Blu ray for many of my movies that visual quality is not so important, like comedies for example.",1530921600,,1377,4.239543726235741
