8525139,5,B0084I7RRY,"Before I started watching this video, I wasn't that optimistic.  There's just so much fluff out there on internet marketing.  You spend half the time waiting for them to get to the point (and sometimes the other half realizing that they don't actually have a point...except maybe to sell you some other useless hypey stuff).

But within the first 3 minutes Zurar was already educating me about the Google Heat Map and the F-Pattern.  So simple once you know it, but so disastrous if you don't.  So many of us have even the layout of our site backwards, leaving thousands of dollars on the table. :o

The video had so many valuable insights such as ""fancy graphic, no traffic"": your website can look great, but your website's design is only as useful as the number of people who see it.  Again, so simple once you know it, but so disastrous if you don't.  And before watching this video, most of us just don't know it...including web designers.  I love how Zurar shows what Google and other search engines look for to get your site highly ranked.

The only challenge with this video is that it's pure content.  If you want anecdotes and funny stories, you won't find them here.  What you get is basically the following:

1) A tip about what you're doing wrong with your site (damn!).
2) An example or two of the wrong way and right way to do things (some of these are really cool, like the World of Warcraft example).
3) An action plan for fixing it (I always love an action plan to fix things, instead of just theory about why I suck).

What's also useful about the video is that it's one thing to know what you're doing wrong, but it's a whole other level to be able to actually fix it, and it takes a whole other level of know-how and skill.  I appreciate that Zurar makes some brief references to his internet marketing consulting company, Marked Advantage, in case you want help implementing all the strategies mentioned in the video.  And he does it in a way that isn't hypey and doesn't waste my time telling me why Marked Advantage is the greatest thing since sliced bread, blah, blah, blah.

I even went to [...] and got to see some of the principles of the video in action on the site, such as the Google Heat Map, Silent Sales Machine, and the others.

Now I need to go check my site to see what I can fix.

Can't wait to read Zurar's book, Client Web, when it comes out.",1339545600,2,2381,4.394977168949771
