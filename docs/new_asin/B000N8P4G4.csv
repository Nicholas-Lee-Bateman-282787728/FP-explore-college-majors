8175557,5,B000N8P4G4,"Easily one of the best cop buddy movies, tough guys has the ingredients to pull it off. Lino Ventura and Issac Hayes play well off each other. Fred Williamson typecast as the heavy, plays with ruthless abandonment. The character snake is like a snake. He charms you like one and he turns on you like a viper and Fred does it with style. A priest and a cop is a great screenplay and Lino and Ike make it believable. If you are a fan of the cop-buddy genre, include this movie in your collection. I promise you won't regret it.",1318118400,3,525,4.26
