6251371,5,B00I5EONJC,"All three of these are personal favorites, so I'd certainly consider this a really great deal. Thankfully, Fox has at least three more phenomenal Biblical films they could follow up with.  I'd sure love to see THE STORY OF RUTH, DAVID AND BATHSHEBA and FRANCIS OF ASSISI in another volume to come.  How about it Fox?",1398902400,2,316,4.625
6251372,5,B00I5EONJC,"Since this set is on sale, you get three amazing Biblical epics of the 50s and 60s (the best epic movie era) on bluray for roughly $4 each. Amazing deal. If only for THE BIBLE and THE ROBE, it's incredible. Those two have been beautifully restored by 20th Century Fox and look brilliant on bluray. It's great to see John Huston's THE BIBLE looking so good...and those who saw this year's NOAH will be delighted with Huston's more traditional take on the Ark/Flood story. Huston is a terrific Noah and you get real animals loading into the ark. THE ROBE received a far more extensive restoration and it shows. For being as old as it is, it looks beautiful. Martin Scorsese does a nice intro and there are tons of extras. GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD doesn't fare as well. It looks like FOX/MGM/UA spent about 35 cents to put it on bluray. It even starts with a disclaimer warning that it was presented using the ""best available elements."" But for $4, who cares. You at least get to see the great Herod sequence with Claude Rains.",1398211200,36,1024,4.510752688172043
6251373,5,B00I5EONJC,"Please note that this is a 3-disc Blu ray collection.  Amazon is currently incorrectly listing this as a 1-disc set.

The Greatest Story Ever Told contains a trailer, two documentaries, and a deleted scene.

The Robe disc is loaded with extras, including trailers, a commentary and several featurettes,

6251408,5,B00I5EONJC,"I was really surprised at the quality of the picture especially with ""The Bible"". You always see on new blu ray releases of older movies ""Remastered Edition"" but after seeing them they don't look much different from before, not all but most, thats not the case here with the bible. I have been watching this movie for over 40 years and i have never seen it so crystal clear. The same goes for ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" The cinematography is beautiful. Im not so crazy about Max Von Sydow as Jesus but other than that its just a beautiful movie to look at. The Robe is awsome too, it never looked so good and the extras are plenty.",1461974400,2,635,4.34453781512605

6251415,5,B00I5EONJC,"I picked this up on Amazon for about $17, taxes and shipping included. I had previously bought the double Blu-ray set of ""The 10 Commandments"" and ""Ben Hur"" and wanted more of that. That's an even better set of films and I'd highly recommend that. These films are also good and a great value for the price.

There are 3 Blu-rays discs in this collection, one per film. The remastering for Blu-ray makes all 3 films look great. I'd say ""The Bible - In the Beginning"" looks the best of the three but that's likely due to the quality of the original material. The amount of bonus material is inconsistent from film to film - ""The Bible"" only has a trailer for the film while ""The Robe"" contains LOTS of excellent bonus materials. I didn't realize that ""The Robe"" was responsible for the starting the trend to wider screen films, and the first of many ""sword and sandal"" films. Very interesting.

It's Easter time and we have 2 religious films currently in the theatres and other classics being released on Blu-ray. After Easter, these films will either be cheaper or harder to find. If you like the classic Bible films, this is a great bargain. However, of the two sets I own, I'd recommend ""The 10 Commandments"" and ""Ben Hur"" set first, as I think they're better films. Enjoy!",1453593600,,1274,4.558951965065503

6251443,4,B00I5EONJC,"Being in the UK I can only refer to The Bible & The Greatest Story Ever Told as these are Region Free. Regretfully The Robe is locked as Region A and therefore would not play here (a great pity as I read that the transfer quality is very good and I wanted to experience it). Why TCF has not done the decent thing and made it Region Free I will never know but it seems very puerile of the company in locking it as Region A especially when a Blu-Ray copy is not available here in the UK for one reason or another.  However in commenting on the picture and sound quality of The Bible & The Greatest Story Ever Told, both are equally as good as each other and I am delighted with the quality of the transfer. An excellent buy at the price. Finally, I am giving the rating as 4 stars for the reasons outlined. Get your act together TCF!",1399420800,13,831,4.098159509202454

The videos were sent promptly but and the sound quality is good albeit I had to turn the volume up to 100% on my television to hear it.  The colors in the video are good but the video quality is not of the standard expected in that there is a good deal of noise in the video.  I would hope that given the enormous amount of money spent on the production of this film at the time and the near legendary cast that the movie would be preserved in a better quality for the future generations to enjoy and experience it.,1524096000,,688,4.029411764705882
