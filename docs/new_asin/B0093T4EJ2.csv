8535410,5,B0093T4EJ2,"This is one of my favorite Japanese films and I can't understand why it doesn't get more respect.
I love it for what it is, a sweet family friendly film with a sincere anti-nuclear stance.

A rogue planet is on a collision course with Earth. An unknown planet on the opposite side of our Sun (no, not very plausible) sends emissaries to assist. It is a shared interest to avoid mutual destruction.
The rogue planet looks a lot like a sun to me and it does wreak much havoc before it is destroyed by an Earth scientist's Urium 101 substance.

I find it fascinating that this film was released on 1/29/1956, almost 10 1/2 years after the end of World War II. According to one estimate there were 1,834,000 Japanese  casualties between 1937-1945.
Japan at this time, 1956, appears to be very American, surprisingly so. Complete with glamorous Hollywood type musical performances, including tap dancing!
But there is much native culture evident as well. It makes me ponder how such a polite and seemingly ethical people could be so brutal during wartime.

This is a well made film production overall, with very good values.
Production design is unique, truly expressive.
Effective cinematography. Special effects are a little weak but then again this was 1956.
It's really great to see this as it was intended to be seen in its native form. I don't read or speak Japanese but this release has English subtitles and is Region 0 (ALL), NTSC video format.

My copy was made in China and is DVD-R.
It plays automatically launching into a Japanese language movie trailer (Title 1), next the Main Feature (Title 2, 15 Chapters), then two more Japanese Trailers (Titles 3 & 4) and finishes with a Japanese language video commentary by someone for Channel NECO in Japan (Title 5).
There are no accessible onscreen menus.
Video quality is decent, about 8/10. Picture is a bit soft and fairly grainy without excessive pixelation. It upscales well enough with a 4K player & TV.
Audio quality isn't so great, just acceptable. White noise is an issue.

This release is currently the best edition I have found for this film.
It is a tremendous improvement over the pathetic Public Domain English language version based on an old VHS tape.

A very worthwhile purchase if you like this film and classic science fiction!",1514246400,,2299,4.790404040404041
