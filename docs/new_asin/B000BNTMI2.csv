8089492,5,B000BNTMI2,"Aqua teen hunger force has its own kind of following.  Not for everyone, but if you get Family Guy, Ren and Stimpy, and South Park Humor, you will get this!!!  The three main characters are yes, a Shake, French Fries and a Meat Wad.  Adult Humor, not for young shildren.",1361491200,,270,4.36
8089493,4,B000BNTMI2,"While each season of ATHF has its gems and usually a couple of clunkers, this is right behind season 3 for sheer inventiveness and lunacy.  While some might argue that season 2 was the most consistent, I'd rather see ATHF swing for the fences of insanity, strike out a few times, but knock it out of the park others.  I'll put up with a couple of dopey episodes for the great ones that make me laugh until it hurts while my brain explodes from the mix of high, low and insane humor

For me, the genius episodes in Season 4 include; `Video Ouija',`Dusty Gonzangas', and `Hypno Germ' and are closely followed by  `Unremarkable Voyage', `E-Dork', T-shirt of the Undead', and `Spacegate World'.

Overall, the series has worn off a just bit for me from when I was first blown away by it's sheer dada-esque insanity, but the best episodes still transcend to inspired, sublime levels of bizarre, gross, tweaked humor, leaving you both laughing out loud and shaking your head at the audacity and bravery of the storytelling.

When your starting premise is a giant talking shake, fries, and wad of meat living in suburban New Jersey, USA how wrong can you go? If you like strange, gonzo humor (Monty Python would be my generation's touchstone) and/or out-there adult animation, you owe it to yourself to give this a try -- and give it a couple of episodes to let your head get into what the creators are doing.",1344729600,,1401,4.606425702811245
8089494,5,B000BNTMI2,"This is one of my favorite seasons of ATHF, so this was an excellent choice out of all the seasons that were available at the time to put on UMD. I still have my PSP (haven''t upgraded to the VITA yet) and still enjoy it. Go for it if you have a PSP and enjoy ATHF.",1341792000,,265,3.75
8089495,5,B000BNTMI2,"I'll admit it,the first few times I watched this cartoon I thought it was stupid. Then, one day I watched a full episode and I couldn't believe how funny this show really was. I believe Master Shake and Carl are the funnirst characters and voice characterizations I have ever seen or heard. What seperates A.T.H.F from other Adult Swim Cartoons is the chemistry,writing,and characters. This show to me is pure genius. I mean, how the hell could you even think this stuff up, its beyond me which is why it's a highly successful show. I personaly own every dvd box set (1-4) including this UMD. With all this hype the UMD has zero extras and zero commentary but I could care less. If you value bonus materials more than just the thirteen episodes then you should buy the dvd, (but If you are as lucky as I am by owning a PSP) and enjoy the show I highly recommend buying this UMD.

  If one day I were to bumb into any writer/director/producer/actor of the show I would shake their hand and tell them what a great job they have done with the show. This is my absolute favorite cartoon in the whole world and I would make a strong bet that there will be new seasons in the short future.",1141344000,5,1183,4.368181818181818
8089496,4,B000BNTMI2,Aqua Teen on the Go can only mean one thing. Having the person next to you think you're crazy for watching a cartoon about happy meal items. Nothing cooler than freaking out the squares! It's worth the extra cash for the supberb quality and to scare the normals.,1136419200,2,262,4.479166666666667
8089497,5,B000BNTMI2,"What do you get when you make a cartoon about a meatball , french fries and a milkshake ? well a very funny show it turns out . Volume 4 is the first one I bought but after watching this now I want to get them all . Also the other cartoon Spacecataz is very cool and funny .",1135555200,3,274,3.6610169491525424
