8020722,5,B00022N5ZS,"Rickey Smiley is always funny!  I saw Rickey Smiley Live FROM Atlanta on BET and I thought they were the same but they are not.  However, this is just as good.",1434931200,,159,4.096774193548387
8020723,5,B00022N5ZS,Excellent for gift giving family viewing,1425686400,,40,5.833333333333333
8020724,1,B00022N5ZS,"This was not at all a good performance for Rickey Smiley.  It was not funny, was repetitious and a waste of money.  I bought this as entertainment for a group of church folks, and after previewing it, I chose to leave it at home.  Save your money and purchase something else.",1392076800,,275,4.352941176470588
8020725,3,B00022N5ZS,the comedy was great but there was too much jumping back and forth to different acts.. I prefer live on stage with no interruptions.,1379721600,,132,4.541666666666667
8020726,5,B00022N5ZS,"RICKEY SMILEY IS SO CRAZY FUNNY. I ALMOST WET MYSELF. I LAUGHED ALL THE WAY THRU. RICKEY SMILEY IS SO TALENTED IN HIS COMEDY ABOUT ""PRECIOUS,"" THE CHURCH, THE BAND, AND I ALSO LOVE THE WAY HE PLAYS THE PIANO AND TELL JOKES WHILE PLAYING. WHAT A GUY WHO I LOVE TO SEE IN MOVIES AND STAND-UP COMEDY. YOU WILL LAUGH AND SAY, ""RICKEY SMILEY, YOU ARE NUTS."" LOL!

I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO SEE THIS OVER AND OVER.
LAUGHTER IS GOOD LIKE MEDICINE.

LOVE YA!

8020727,5,B00022N5ZS,"I loved this dvd and for the price yessss! This product was a great deal, shopping for more right now.",1364947200,,102,4.15
8020728,1,B00022N5ZS,"this dvd wasn't what i was expecting. i thought is was the show that plays on BET often but it seems like it is an older version,",1356739200,,129,3.814814814814815
8020729,5,B00022N5ZS,"I agree with the first reviewer that Ricky Smiley made me laugh from beginning to end of the concert. He is a fresh comedy voice for me. Smiley's unique approach to traditional and often mundane African-American cultural issues(grandmothers, religion,marching band comparisons,gospel singer varieties,black musicians and our musical intonations and  movements,etc) are hilarious and provide  a cultural depth and understanding  beyond the usual comic allusion to ""you know how we do it"" sthick. Although his comedy is almost nonoffensive, it is not quite as innocent as Sinbad,so a responsible adult needs to be around for young children to keep things in perspective.

This DVD is well worth spending your time with friends watching and enjoying. I highly recommend that you add it to your comedy collection. Ricky Smiley has an interesting comedy niche staked out and he is creative and funny, and one of a kind.",1355702400,,914,5.2827586206896555
8020730,4,B00022N5ZS,"Rickey Smiley is a fool!  I don't think I've ever seen him have an ""off"" day.  This DVD had me cracking up from beginning to end.",1112486400,14,129,3.923076923076923
