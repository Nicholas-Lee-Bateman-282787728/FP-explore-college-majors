3477306,5,B001AZI22W,Hello There...  This is only one of Her workout DVDs that I own and I must say they are ALL great fun (and a good workout too!!!) My niece and My Mom (Grandma) and I all work out at the same time and have a wonderful time doing it.  Doesn't seem like work at all!!!~!  BUT you feel it later.  If you want a good workout for all ages and you want to have a fun time in the process...try Hemalayaa's workouts!!  Absolutely OUTSTANDING!!!,1226966400,,435,4.130952380952381

3477308,5,B001AZI22W,I am so excited Hemalayaa has a new DVD - I love her other DVDs and this one is just as fun.  I laugh while working out and next thing I know the workout is over and I feel great.,1225411200,,179,3.475

3477317,4,B001AZI22W,"This is a great video. I have a ton of workout videos- mostly Jillian michaels kathy kaehler etc but wanted to try something new. I will first say ""I cannot dance"" its true I am impossible but this was very easy to do and lots of fun and the direction, music, and actors are great. not irritating just fun and freeing. I tried zumba but quit because the moves are too specific and I couldn't do them. but this was great. Im going to order more of the videos from her collection. And I was quite sore for the first 3 times after doing this so it does actually work, just muscles that other workouts don't traditionally focus on. The only reason I didn't give it 5 is because they do tend to focus on one movement for an extended period of time. They change it up with speed and arm movements though.",1407628800,,798,4.222222222222222
3477318,5,B001AZI22W,"By far the most fun, great excercise, meditative with movement, sensual, exotic, instructional dance video I have ever done! I try different dance videos frequently, and this is the most fun I have ever had while simultaneiously getting a great workout, and sweat. I love how this dance is a sensual meditation in motion for the feminine energy. The last part is incredible!!!",1403654400,,376,4.984126984126984

3477321,5,B001AZI22W,So much fun! and was easy to follow along and learn the moves-- Would definitely recommend this to my friends!,1395878400,,110,4.55
3477322,5,B001AZI22W,She makes working out fun. An hour goes by and it doesn't even feel like it. A must buy for those who are tired of those boring plank and crunch work outs!,1395878400,,155,3.875
3477323,5,B001AZI22W,"Rating is five stars, It could not be any less.  Yes, I am a male and I heard a lot from my female friends, sisters, and female coworkers about not having enough time to work out, its boring, takes away from the family, and ect. This DVD is in complete English.  I am going to put this in my face book page.  I have also ordered 7 DVDs for my female relatives, friends, coworkers, sister-n-law, and ex-wife.  So do I think highly of this?  You will hear words like Boo-tay walk, Swan, Tick-tock, Hip flick, and Over the shoulder.  This is more than exercise for the complete body.  It is the teaching of being Sensual....  Years ago, my ex  took lessons on belly dancing.  Then she was too embarrassing to show me. It seem to me ( a man) that American women/girls are embarrassed to show sensually unless it has to do with sex.  It is another way of dancing, flirting, and expressing oneself.  So I am giving copies of this DVD to my people. The ages are 20 to over 60.  Friends, this is for your health, your sensually, and your love life (husband or other person).",1395273600,,1066,4.3232323232323235
3477324,5,B001AZI22W,"Hemalayaa has a great booty, and thighs exercises in this video. There is a warm up and then three workouts. In the first two workouts you learn different moves. In the last workout you combine all the moves you just learned. This workout is so fun, and you feel sexy when you move you hips like this!!! After the workouts there is a cool down. I think her workouts are awesome, and I like that she is so energetic, expressive and smiley!! ""laugh, smile, enjoy yourself""!!!",1395273600,,473,4.511627906976744

3477326,4,B001AZI22W,"Her dance workouts are a blast to do. Even when I don't want to exercise, I find myself laughing and enjoying myself not 10 mins in. This one in particular is not as hard as some of the others, in so that I mean I don't get winded and sweaty half as much. I use it for days when I'm not feeling like bouncing around too much.

For me, I don't feel ""booty"" in particular with most of these moves, but my butt has never been my area of focus, so I don't mind if it's not targeting it. I use it as a gentler, lower body work out.",1390694400,,526,3.8256880733944953
3477327,3,B001AZI22W,This is a good workout but it is not what i expected. I wanted to work out to the songs I know from Bollywood but instead you just hear her annoying voice for the most part. STILL I FELT IT IN MY THIGHS!!!!!!,1390435200,,208,3.86046511627907
3477328,5,B001AZI22W,"I'll start by saying that I don't really like working out. It's just a habit that I do every day. With that said I found myself smiling and even laughing when I did this workout for the first time. It's enough of a workout to get you sweating and works a lot of muscle groups, but it really is just so much fun!",1390262400,,311,3.9523809523809526
3477329,5,B001AZI22W,Saw on TV she was very good and my daughter and I were having so much fun dancing along I had to order..,1389225600,,104,3.5652173913043477
3477330,3,B001AZI22W,"I'll say at the outset that I am not thrilled with this DVD, but your mileage may vary. It all depends on what you're looking for in a workout DVD.

First, some general comments on the production value. The camera angle changes frequently, sometimes as often as every few seconds. This is distracting and sometimes you can't even see what you need to see as far as the demonstration goes. For example, in one segment, you reach your arm over your head with your hand in a mudra (hand position). However, you do 5-6 reaches before you even see what the hand movement is.

One way to overcome this problem is to watch the DVD in its entirety before attempting to do the exercises contained therein. Then you'd know what to expect.

The music is on an endless loop, which is somewhat annoying. The other reviewers suggest that Hemalayaa is off-beat. I don't notice this, but I have no rhythm and no dance background. So if you are like me, this won't bother you. If you have some dance experience, however, your opinion will likely differ.

I think the set is nice (appropriate for the type of dance and not too cluttered) although the lighting is a bit dark. The women behind Hemalayaa are mostly able to keep up and seem to know what they're doing.

As a workout video, what this DVD lacks is cueing. Hemalayaa's commentary is excessive (instead of just telling you what the moves are, she adds a lot of chatter) and she's doing more describing of the action than telling you what's next. It's almost as if she's watching it for the first time, herself. It doesn't give a feel of being choreographed, which is not a good thing in a dance workout.

This DVD has six main segments, a warm-up, four ""workouts,"" and a cool-down.

The warm-up is short -- only about four minutes. You do a lot of arm movements that you will need to remember later and, to be fair, you do move the entire body.

Workout 1 is about five and a half minutes. It involves a lot of plies, some with toe taps or kicks, and a variety of upper arm movements. There's also some walking in place. This one is fun, actually, but too short to properly be called a ""workout.""

Workout 2 is eight minutes long. You use the arm movements from the warmup a lot. There are some lunges and hops here. You should watch out for these -- there's no instruction as to how to safely perform these moves. In the lunges, Hemalayaa's knees go way out over her toes, which most other workout DVDs recommend against doing. And the hops are high-impact. She tells you not to do the hops if it's hard on your knees, but doesn't offer an alternative move. This segment also has some hip lifts and shimmies.

Workout 3 is about twelve and a half minutes long. It consists almost entirely of moving your hips in a figure 8 and hip flicks/lifts. The last 2-3 minutes of this one have some additional moves.

Workout 4 is about eleven and a half minutes long. This is a collection of moves from the other segments and doesn't contain anything new. While I could've dealt with the amount of repetition in the other segments, this one really drove home just how much repetition this DVD contained.

The cool-down is only about three and a half minutes (the rest of this track on the DVD consists of the credits). It's a pretty standard Hemalayaa cool down, with lots of forward bends and slow, flowing movements. There's one part where you squat deeply, with your rear end almost to the floor and your knees sharply bent. Be careful with this part, as it could be brutal if you have bad knees. I have to back off in this segment.

You are not going to get much benefit from only doing one or two of the workouts and nothing else. Even doing the whole DVD may not be enough to break a sweat if you're an intermediate or advanced exerciser. One thing that could be useful is doing a segment or two of this as a warm-up before lower body strength training, just for something different.

There are a few good things about this DVD. It's fairly fun, and you don't need a lot of room. You don't need to be super-coordinated and, with the amount of repetition, you'll have the moves down by the end (there aren't any complicated combinations). It won't teach you to be a dancer, but it will get you moving. Hemalayaa is enthusiastic and seems to genuinely be enjoying herself.

In the end, what you'll get out of this depends on what you're looking for. If you just want something fun to do a couple of times a month to change up your routine, or if you want to use part of this as a warm-up for strength training, it may be worth a purchase. If you're already a dancer or are serious about dropping some weight, you may want to look elsewhere.",1387152000,3,4677,4.4157955865272935
3477331,3,B001AZI22W,"Hemalaya is perky and cute,
But this didn't really work my glutes,
It made my achy knees and back scream,
Not exactly my workout dream,

This DVD is well-made and easy to follow,
However the workout promises are hollow,
You will sweat a little and learn a few moves,
I like how Hemalaya grooves,

I wish she'd make a routine,
Of dance moves that would make me look good in jeans,
Bollywood with some booty moves too,
That is what I ask of you.",1383004800,4,443,4.261904761904762
3477332,5,B001AZI22W,"I just tried this for the first time this morning.  I did the warm up, the first 2 workouts and the cool down.  What FUN!!!  The music was fun and the moves were a blast!  I like the way Hemalayaa uses visualization and makes everything a positive, fun experience.  She encourages you to feel sensual in the movements, which is kind of a giggle for me as a mother of 5, but it's a great workout.  I did it 12 hours ago, and my thighs are still burning!  I am also a big fan of Bollywood Boogie.  I also bought Bollywood Burn, but I haven't tried it yet.  LOVE HER!",1373328000,,564,4.054545454545455
3477333,4,B001AZI22W,"Fun moves, good music.  You can follow along or improv.  Move the same or at your own pace.  Some moves are similar to the hula.  You will want to keep your feet on the ground during the brief jumping moves if you are older or if you have knee issues.",1372118400,,251,3.96
3477334,2,B001AZI22W,Slow rhythm & music isn't enjoyable while working out. Her voice is annoying as she instructs dance moves. The settings look old & not up to date.,1368144000,,146,4.444444444444445
3477335,5,B001AZI22W,This is a great exercise video. It is easy to follow and low impact on the back and knees. I skip the jumping parts sometimes.,1364428800,,126,4.08
3477336,5,B001AZI22W,"First of all, I LOVE this dvd ! I'm 30 and a pretty active person; I do a lot of zumba and workout classes and I can't attend those classes, I love doing workout dvds. I'm pretty used to Jillian Michaels 30 day shred and Ripped in 30 type of dvds and I wanted to try something more fun for days when I just wanted to shake my booty.
This dvd is a lot of fun and brings a lot of happiness. I know people have a hard time with the voice over but it didn't bother me at all since the instructor always has a nice smile on her face and is very expressive with her movements. I love the fact that the moves have a meaning to them, like ""paint the walls with love"" and then ""paint yourselves with the same kindness"". It is not only a focus on fitness and building muscles and strength but it is also about feel good and sexy ! Some hip movements can be a bit challenging but I felt like the workout helped me loosen my spine. I also love the sassiness about it !

I really recommend if you don't necessarily have a crazy hardcore workout but if you want to sweat, smile and feel happy and sexy :D Have fun ! Namaste",1363651200,,1109,3.9730941704035874
3477337,5,B001AZI22W,"Pros:
* Great for beginners or people (like me) who need extra toning and aren't in their best shape (gets some great firmness on the thighs and butt)
* Doesn't require a large space to do
* Simple, fairly easy to follow routine - if you aren't used to learning dance/exercise routine it might take a few tries
* Moves have names that will make you smile, and the instructor encourages you to laugh at them
* Upbeat, although slightly hyper sounding, instructor (seriously she sounds like she just downed 8 shots of espresso)
* Right from the beginning it states it is designed for ALL body types, sizes and is meant to enhance a woman's assets. So firm and enhance the rear bumper, wittle the waist. Perfect.
* Music is nice, not the best, but good.

Cons:
* While it does have a Bollywood flavor, it really isn't as Bollywood oriented as I would have liked. I love bollywood dancing, and this may be inspired by it, but it isn't going ot teach you moves you've seen in films. However, since it is a beginner level workout that isn't really surprising.
* Maybe it is just after getting used to everything in HD, but it isn't the most crisp image.

Overall, I give 5 stars. I was looking for easy for getting back in shape and something that makes me smile while I sweat. Honestly, I loved it as soon as they talked about embracing your body type and enhancing what you have.",1362528000,5,1375,4.409448818897638
3477338,5,B001AZI22W,"I did these workouts on demand when we had cable, and loved them. I looked forward to workouts. I did this one and the dance workouts. These are my favorite workouts.",1357948800,,166,4.387096774193548
3477339,5,B001AZI22W,"Ladies, if you are looking for a workout that's fun and a bit different and makes you smile while you sweat then you must give this one a go! I have been doing 3 routines plus the warmup 2-3 times a week and by the time I am finished am totally drenched in sweat.  I bought a belly dancing hip scarf on eBay for aud$10 which i wear over exercise pants and a crop top so I jingle to the moves as well which helps me move my booty more.
Hemalayaa is an amazing instructor, I've seen many fitness DVDs and for me what helps me chose one is if I like the instructor and the way she teaches and after seeing the previews on YouTube I couldn't wait to give it a go and I was not disappointed. I'm quite uncoordinated but once you do the routines a few times you get used to moving different parts of your body at the same time. I was surprised with myself because I never even had to stop and rewind any of it on my first go so that was a giant plus. The music is cool too so that helps. The hopping is very minimal, I have knee problems so I just don't do the hopping and my knees are fine with everything else. The swan is very sensual and the elk move is hot and I agree that bollywood vogue has to be done with the funny face.
Hemalayaa was once on Ellen so check that one out on you tube.
Have fun and play with bollywood booty!",1356998400,2,1327,3.933085501858736
3477340,5,B001AZI22W,"I saw a trailer and thought hey, I can do this.  Well I can and have and really love it.  I had purchased a bellydance scarf for my Zumba workout and use it w/this so I can hear by booty shaking. It is so much fun that it must be illegal!! I will eventually get all of her video collection.  I like having fun when I workout and I add weights to make it more intense(hand and ankle types)  I just love the fun part, because if I am not having fun I will not do it!!",1346198400,,465,3.7628865979381443
3477341,5,B001AZI22W,"I have many of the Hemalayaa videos, and while I love them all, this is one of my favorites.  It is a fun workout, and I can feel the difference in my legs after exercising with the video.  My other favorite is ""Bollywood Dance Workout."" These two videos are the best, although, I would recommend any of Hemalayaa's workout videos.  She is a great motivator, and the workouts are always exciting and enjoyable.",1340668800,,410,4.589041095890411
3477342,5,B001AZI22W,"Like another reviewer, I have this in both DVD and instant video and have no problem with the beat matching the moves.  This is fun and is enough of a workout to create a ""glow"".",1340064000,,178,4.085714285714285
3477343,4,B001AZI22W,"Hemalayaa provides a warm-up that's pretty effective. The warm-up alone is worth having. I like that it's low-impact so that most people can do it. I do think certain sections of the workout would strengthen your thighs and your rear end. But Hemalayaa incorporates some high-impact exercises that seem more geared for cardio than for shaping your muscles.

Sometimes her voice-overs are annoying, such as ""Paint yourself ... infuse yourself with love."" I prefer it when she just gives cues and encouragement. I don't need to hear, ""All your cells are getting excited.""

For the most part, the music is motivating. The set is appropriate -- not too cluttered, but interesting.

I liked that Hemalayaa incorporated some bellydance moves like the figure 8 and snake arms. Of course, she puts her own style on them. If you're going to get one of her Bollywood excercise workouts, I'd get this one instead of ""The Bollywood Dance Workout."" This one is far less silly and much more graceful.

I'm not sure why the entire sequence of exercises was repeated. I would have preferred to have some different moves included instead. I wouldn't say that this is really four separate workouts. I'm not sure why it's marketed that way.

But I really do like Hemalayaa as an instructor. I guess I'd just like to see her teaching a different kind of workout -- more structured and totally low-impact.

Special features: There is a bonus classical Indian dance with Hemalayaa that's really more of a stretch. It might be good for getting your muscles to relax. Like yoga, it has some exercise benefits. But a lot of the symbolism is annoying. Everything seems to be a goddess pose or an acknowledgment to ""mother earth."" I guess I just prefer the professional exercise approach to the pagan imagery.

Then there is the extra free-for-all ""Liberation"" dance with some other instructor which consists of a bunch of people just bopping around like monkeys. It's more like a meaningless music video than a workout. The voice-overs are silly and obnoxious ... ""dancing for no reason at all."" Yeah. I guess so. Who'd have a reason to dance like that? It's not even dance.

The third extra is a Brazilian workout that is fairly high impact. It seems like it would be pretty fun on days when you have a lot of energy. You'll have to ignore the third performer, however, because he really doesn't fit in with his dreadlocks. I guess the makers of the video wanted to indicate that men could do the workout, too. Maybe they thought the wild look was better than the athletic look, but I don't agree. This is, after all, an exercise workout.

Most likely I will want to just stick with the workouts by Hemalayaa. The last two special features are really previews of other DVDs. I'd be interested in the Brazilian one if the third performer didn't look so silly. But the ""Liberation"" one is worthless. If I want to dance freely, I'll do it. I don't need a DVD full of obnoxious chatter and people flopping around to do it. At least you don't pay for it, because it's just an extra. And you can skip it if you want.

3477344,5,B001AZI22W,"I detest exercising.  It is my least favorite thing to do, but since I want to be healthy I drag myself through work outs anyway.  But this is fun!  From the hip popping to the Bollywood posing, every minute is a joy.  I'm sweating my butt off and still smiling!  Amazing.

All the dance moves are explained well, and you are given plenty of time to learn the next step.  You definitely feel it in your hips, lower abs, butt, and legs as you follow along. This is my favorite addition to my at home workout routine.",1336089600,4,515,4.247422680412371

I also use the Zumba workout with my Wii player which is a good cardio program but, after doing the Bollywood Booty routine, I really feel it in the glutes, thighs and calves. I love the fact that I can do her routines in bare feet. She is very pleasant to follow and has an uplifting spirit that projects thru the TV screen. All of her dvds including this one are broken up into several short sessions so you can pick and choose the ones you like or do them all together for a great cardio and toning workout. I will definitely buy more of her dvds as new ones come out, she actually makes me WANT to workout everyday!",1305158400,3,732,4.125874125874126
3477347,4,B001AZI22W,"On preview, I was not overly enthused with this workout but after finally giving it a try I found it was a lot of fun. Good for light/recovery days, you get about 40 minutes of continuous movement, enough that my headband was soaked when it was through. The pace is doable and the steps are very easy, though if you are uncoordinated like me, it might be a good idea to start with a belly dance basics DVD so that you can learn some of the movements as there are no actual ""how-to"" dance instructions. The sections are rather repetitive but for me that's a plus because I really need to work on my figure eights and hip bumps. (To be honest, I need to work on everything!) Hemalayaa has a stunning but approachable beauty and a warm deep voice--a joy to listen to even if her cues are not always where they need to be. She's a pleasant and encouraging instructor who makes the workout inviting, I'll be buying more of her DVDs.",1302566400,5,927,4.333333333333333

Also, most of the repetitive movements involve light bending of the knees over and over.

3477354,2,B001AZI22W,"I wanted to like this video, but I can't say I do.

Hemalayaa does all right in terms of enthusiasm. But she misrepresents some of the work that goes into ""hip flicks,"" saying the movement comes from the hip.  It doesn't.  It comes from the knees and abs.  I have a problem with her bouncing movements as well. Only in this video does she acknowledge that hops can hurt a person's knees. The bouncing stretches, which she also uses on ""Beautiful Belly,"" can cause injury. (So don't bounce, stretch. No workout should hurt you.)

I have a hard time with her diction, too. I guess it's because I'm from a different generation, but I really do prefer hearing the correct terms (e.g., gluteus or glutes) rather than slang. I knew to expect the word ""booty,"" but ""Butt Monster Moves""?  A little too crass for me.

I find the editing something of a problem because the cut-aways mess up what there is of a count system and when they come back to the dancers' actions, the dancers aren't moving in the correct direction. Sometimes even Hemalayaa is moving in the wrong direction. Oh, and Hemalayaa gets her left and right mixed up at times. Since she did a voice over, you'd think they would have fixed the problem. Or maybe they didn't notice. (Acacia People: next time try the workout a few times before you print the DVD!)

Speaking of counts, they seem slapdash. I've counted out the movements. Sometimes Hemalayaa starts a new movement on 7 and others at 8. There are instances of 6 count steps, which occur with some predictability once you know what to expect, but she doesn't say so.  Even her own back up dancers seem to be confused every once in a while.

The warm up is too short, warming up nothing at all and the routine itself is boring. It feels as if she just threw it together on a whim. That said, it gets the job done.

What do I like?  Well, I do appreciate Hemalayaa's beauty and physique. I appreciate her enthusiasm. I think that maybe her yoga practice might be more inspiring, and I'd like to see her teaching traditional Indian dance, since her short dance presentation was lovely. I wish she'd talk a little more about the meaning of the mudra she used in the workout--because different mudras do have different meanings. It would only take a few seconds.",1259798400,7,2275,4.5354523227383865

I really like that. Hemalayaa is fun and engaging and even though I look like a klutz right now trying to dance, she makes me want to keep on trying.

3477361,4,B001AZI22W,"This DVD is taught by Hemalayaa Behl, who appears along with two female background exercisers.  It actually offers four short workout segments (each less than 15 minutes in length) in addition to the warm-up and cool-down, thus allowing users to customize the total length of their workout time.  I have broken down each of these segments in greater detail below.

>WARM-UP (4 min).  Here Hemalayaa introduces the ""walk,"" a move that replaces the basic march seen in many other workouts.  This is sort of a hip sway from side-to-side, and she uses it in place, moving forward, and moving back.  She also performs mini-plis and teaches the arm movements that are used throughout the workout.  Although Hemalayaa gives the Indian names for these exercises, she explains them by asking users to envision everyday movements--e.g., lightbulb arms, painting the walls, etc.
>WORKOUT 1 (5.5 min).  Hemalayaa calls this segment ""Butt Monster Moves.""  She returns to the mini-pli introduced in the warm-up but adds many different variations, including toe taps, side reaches, butt kicks, leg lifts, etc.
>WORKOUT 2 (8 min).  The first half of this workout includes a series of side-to-side lunge variations; Hemalayaa cues different arm movements (including ""Indian vogue arms"") and moves at a relatively quick pace.  The second half includes some plis as well as mini hops. Hemalayaa has you hop around so that you are facing away from the TV, and then you swivel just your head back over your shoulder while doing some fast hip flicks--this was a lot of fun!
>WORKOUT 3 (12 min).  This workout begins with the swan, a figure eight move with the hips.  Hemalayaa adds in a hip flick, going back and forth from side-to-side and constantly changing up the tempo.  However, because the swan and the hip flick were the only moves in this longer segment, it started to feel quite repetitive after awhile.
>WORKOUT 4 (11 min).  For this final section, Hemalayaa does not teach anything new; rather, she incorporates parts of each of the three prior workout segments above.
>COOL-DOWN (3.5 min).  Hemalayaa concludes the workout by leading fluid, yoga-like stretching.

Overall, Hemalayaa and her two female background exercisers really do seem to be enjoying themselves during this workout.  Although some of the moves WERE fun, I didn't find the workout to be very intense, and I didn't really find that it targeted my ""booty"" more than any other area.  This DVD is probably best suited for those looking for a very light, fun cardio workout--if you don't mind shaking your booty, Hemalayaa is likely to put a smile on your face.",1251158400,21,2616,4.986175115207374

3477367,5,B001AZI22W,"I have to start by saying that Hemalayaa's workouts have changed my life. I hated every form of physical activity (except dancing) and had never found a video that I enjoyed and that provided results. I'm so glad I found Hemalayaa's DVDs because now I do one a day and I already feel beautiful and in much better shape. I even walk with more confidence, and I'm pretty sure my butt is rounder!

I already owned two Hemalayaa DVDs (Bollywood Burn and Beautiful Belly) and so my only decision was which one to try next. Bollywood Booty is, in my opinion, her best yet, for 1) how much fun the exercises are, 2) how sexy and varied the movements are, 3) how awesome the music is, and 4) the bonus dance Odissi in the special features.

Bollywood Booty is a lighter-weight workout than Beautiful Belly (which is the best for quick abdominal results). Hemalayaa is, as usual, joyful and the perfect instructor for those of us who don't like to take ourselves or our workout too seriously.

Happily, I wasn't.

Whether this DVD will reshape your backside as it promises, I do not doubt, but this depends upon the level of your fitness.  Repeated movements of this sort cannot help but redefine your butt.  However, Hemalayaa's derriere workout is limited to fast plies and side to side lunges that she incorporates to work within the pacing of a dance that she threads together in four separate segments that when played back to back equal the entire 45 minute program.  Squats are mentioned on the back cover of the case, but other than a repetitive backwards motion where one's back is flat and the rear end is thrust out with exaggerated hip movements, I do not recall any of the classic move being incorporated.  Hand and arm movements abound as well as full body undulations that Hemalayaa explains in exuberant voice-over as she stomps through the segments in happy abandon that one cannot fail to want to emulate. Caveat: Hemalayaa and her dance team do perform barefooted as I did. Simply don exercise footwear to prevent problems if your knees experience pain during jumping movements.

Bollywood Booty is not billed as a cardio workout, therefore I did not expect to have an elevated heart rate throughout the routine.  With that thinking put aside, I was able to enjoy the DVD for what it was worth--as an do-able and entertaining routine that introduces the participant to Bhangra dance. As I sashayed, tic-toked, jumped and elked my way through the routine with a big smile on my face, I realized that Bollywood Booty delivered the fun it advertised. Maybe I wasn't sweating, but I got my body moving and felt good for the rest of the day.

In addition to the four individual ""Booty"" segments, Bollywood Booty includes bonus dance features that act as advertisements for other Acacia products.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-and-Be-Fit-Brazilian-Body/dp/B001B1Q2U4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance and Be Fit: Brazilian Body</a>&nbsp;looked particularly appealing to someone like myself who wants to feel a little more intensity while performing simpler moves within the framework of dance.

Bottom line?  If you are in reasonable fitness health, don't expect to be sweating profusely at the end of this 45 minute boot-ay sculpting session.  If you are accustomed to performing repetitive squats, lunges and other butt building exercises, you may be a little disappointed in Hemalayaa's offering.  Here, the moves fit together to enable the participant to perform a facsimile of a Punjabi dance (think the vibrantly happy dance fest in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monsoon-Wedding/dp/B00006AW0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monsoon Wedding</a>&nbsp;or the train station stomp in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slumdog-Millionaire/dp/B001P9KR8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slumdog Millionaire</a>) and relish the ebullient sensual feeling of moving sinuously with the beat rather than focus on slowly perfecting form.  Recommended as a smile-cracking alternative to the usual larger moves utilized in other butt sculpting DVDs.

So, I'm very active, healthy, and in good shape. I got this workout on a whim, based on a review that I had read elsewhere. I was looking for something different to do, other than my pilates and cardio/tone interval DVDs. I get bored easily, and need lots of change to keep my interest. I watched this one day while on the treadmill and did it the next morning before work. It was a lot of FUN. Not your regular excercise routine. It got me moving and doing SOMETHING, rather than starting my day with a trek on the treadmill - I saved that for later. It's very carefree and flowing. I laughed while doing it and had a good time before I had to head out the house. A great way to start the day. It's not going to give you muscules or firm you like a fitness model. It's simply going to get you moving and bring you heart rate up a bit. If you're looking for a good, fun time that is different from the rest of the workout DVDs, this is it. After doing this one and having such a good time, I ordered several other of Hemalayaa's DVDs, and I'm really looking forward to trying them out.
Just have fun with this. Let yourself go, dance like no one is watching, and enjoy yourself. Being fit isn't always about the strenous weight lifting and sweat drenching runs. It's about moving, having a good time, and keeping regular with whatever makes you feel good.

The music is engaging and upbeat which is wonderful for a workout video. There was a lot of thought put into the ambiance of the video that shows what a master dancer Hemalayaa is.
The Workout begins with a warm up that introduces you to the movements and the names of certain moves that you will be doing during the workout. Then the rest of the workout is broken down into segments which can be played all together or done seperately if you aren't ready for the whole thing. Each segment works in different combinations which are all fun and sassy. The Butt Monster Moves will have you sweating with a smile plastered across your face. I love the Elk moves! So sassy and playful.
Have you ever watched a workout video where all the people in it look bored or you can tell they are reminding themselves to smile? It looks forced and painful. This is NOT that DVD. Hema and her two dancers all look like they are truly enjoying themselves and dancing with one another. That is such a rare thing that my husband even pointed it out. I am not sure how you could refrain from smiling while doing the ""Butt Monster Moves"" but I have seen some DVDs where sour faced backup dancers could have.
This is a great workout for the core, hips, thighs, and of course the booty. Not only will your booty be lifted...your spirits will as well.

This is mostly because Hemalayaa spends a lot of time telling you to 'play with the camera' instead of how to work the gluts! The 'butt monster' move,which was introduced in the beginning, was not challenging at all. In fact there are more torso exercises than those working the gluts. A lot of the glut action involves just plies, but Bollywood dance involves so much more than that. The last dance segment combined other dance segments with a slight variation instead of just creating a challenging dance sequence. By this time my body was bored, not tired. Thankfully there is a 5 1/2 minute segment of 'Brazilian Body' with Kimberly Mullen in the bonus features section. Now that really got the body going including the all important gluts!

8280682,5,B001AZI22W,So much fun and playfulness tricks you into thinking this workout isn't a challenge!!! This has firmed my booty and my waist! Hemalaya is such a beautiful and encouraging dance instructor. This workout is fun and sexy!!!,1470787200,,220,4.972972972972973
8280683,5,B001AZI22W,"WORTH THE LOW COST. Arrived Tuesday. I've used it Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday-purchased more of her workouts right away. My body feels it already. Intend to do the workout one week then switch to BELLY for a week then DANCE for the next week. One caveat-the BOLLYWOOD DANCE WORKOUT already contains the BOOTY so don't buy separately if you get the DANCE; [I'll gift the extra.] Fun and really makes you sweat a bit. I don't do the jumping but modify as she encourages. Seems my 20 pounds overweight will be a thing of the past very soon combined with my modified food plan.",1448064000,2,572,4.563106796116505
