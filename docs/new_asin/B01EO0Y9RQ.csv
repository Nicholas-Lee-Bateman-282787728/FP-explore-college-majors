8759287,1,B01EO0Y9RQ,"Alas, typical Zurich Opera production.  Very complicated set that takes over and conquers all.  Interlocking rooms on a revolving stage and the entire company continually  troop from one room to another.  They never stand still so you can hear the music!  Everything done to distract you from Bellini!  Joyce DiDonato does her very best to surmount all this, but she's constantly stalked by an androgynous mime representing death since at one moment Romeo says ""Death is my constant companion.""  A further distraction!
Get the San Francisco Opera production with DiDonato at her best, a splendid staging, a wonderful Guilietta, and the company stands still so you can imbibe the glorious music.  A plus for those wanting to be up to date: the exuberantly flowing costumes are by famous fashion designer Christian Lacroix.  The whole thing is a treat!  Bellini would love it!",1481414400,3,874,5.091549295774648
8759288,4,B01EO0Y9RQ,"I attend a great many ""live"" performances particularly in Germany and I try in most cases just keep any reviews/comments re DVD or Blu-rays simple.  I'm not a singer and I have no technical knowledge of the art - I just know when I enjoyed a performance and when I didn't.  In this case, I liked it much better than I expected.  I generally not a fan of Loy with his often very sparse settings - however, this idea of death and rival crime organizations seemed very appropriate to me.  The singing was terrific and I am generally not a big fan of DiDonato.  There is something about her voice that just feels thin/shrill to me but I know I'm in the minority.  All is definitely good re the production and the singing but I took off a star for the sound.  I don't want something overly miked but there was very poor placement here.  The voices felt recessed the majority of the time causing too much emphasis on the orchestra -- there seemed to be a very slight echo.  It was especially noticeable in the last half of act 2 when a few times the voices almost disappeared.  A natural sound is fine but the voices still need to be clearly heard.  I'm curious to know if anyone else thought the same re the sound.  This is the Blu-ray disc, not the DVD and I only listen to the regular 2 channel sound, not the 5.1.",1481328000,2,1311,4.2631578947368425
8759289,4,B01EO0Y9RQ,"This has all the hallmarks of a Zrich Opernhaus video: good video, superb, first rate, uncompressed natural audio, great singers and an anti-septic, bourgeois regie. The singers are mostly very good, DiDonato (Romeo) and Kulchynska (Giulietta) are excellent. Luisi mostly serviceable - he doesn't keep the momentum, tempi sometimes drag until interrupted by sudden accelerandos . Repeats are uncut and embellished. The first time I watched it I found it annoying and wrote a scathing review, but upon repeat reviewing I ""got"" it, it can be recommended and I have nothing to add to ""Keris Nine""'s detailed review, except expounding on how good the sound engineering is.

The sound engineering is very naturalistic, exactly to my taste, not close miked (no body mics), with real inhouse acoustic, vivid, with a very wide dynamic range (you have to turn the volume up to hear the singers clearly, but then expect loud outbursts from the chorus - this is exactly as it should be). When ""Keris Nine"" writes ""...her voice soaring with the high drama"", I think it refers to the wonderful phenomenon that inhouse, a singer's voice can swell, bloom and fill the house with rich, reflected overtones. This is usually not captured well on recordings, particularly when body-mics are used, but here it is captured very well. The singers' voices, particularly the females have a huge dynamic range, exactly as inhouse.

This is worth 5 stars, but it is now mandatory to knock off one star whenever there are no subtitles in the original language as in this case.",1477094400,2,1549,4.976833976833976
8759290,5,B01EO0Y9RQ,"Essentially what is left of Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' in Bellini's I Capuleti e i Montecchi (the libretto actually taken from another source) is two rival Italian families teetering on the brink of all-out gang war and a young couple from the two families who want to get married and live a life without fear of the constant feuds and assassinations. It's 'The Godfather' really, Romeo the Michael Corleone of the family, a young man with progressive ideas refusing to inherit the role as the boss of a murderous mob family, but he is drawn in against his will, unable to escape the blood ties that determine how he must act.

Put like that, it seems obvious to stage I Capuleti e i Montecchi as a mafia drama, but it's not at all obvious that such a modern setting would fit with Bellini's bel canto music. Between Fabio Luisi's musical direction and Christof Loy's dramatic direction of it on the stage, it turns out that it is more than capable of sustaining just such an interpretation. The mood is well established during the overture, the revolving set showing a series of rooms littered with bodies of gentlemen in suits. Bodies piled up in offices, in anterooms, in bathrooms, in bedrooms. We also see a young child being prepared for a wedding, and later see her as a young woman. As the stage revolves and the scenes flow, we see however that she is clearly traumatised by the carnage. Death is all she has ever known.

The mood is sustained by the dimly lit, sepia toned lighting through the Venetian blinds spilling shadowy lines across the wood-panelled sparsely decorated rooms. The rooms are invariably inhabited by powerful men in dark suits and tuxedos, standing around looking threatening. The tension is such that you feel a fight could break out at any moment and inevitably it does, though mostly off-stage, the set revolving like the sweep of a camera pan to the adjoining room where more bodies litter the floor. Loy also brings in an additional non-singing character to shadow the performers. He/she is an adjutant for Romeo, a go-between that permits the otherwise unlikely frequent incursions that the Montecchi Romeo seems to be able to freely make into Capuletti turf to visit Giulietta's room. This silent sinister figure however also incorporates the musical motif of premonitory death that lies between them.

There's a lot more to making the staging of I Capuleti e i Montecchi work than simply dressing the sets and the characters like it were 'The Godfather' although Alexei Botnarciuc gives a great Brando impersonation as Capellio, the head of the Cappelli family. It's Loy's direction of the singers as actors that makes it work convincingly, his use of the stage as ever impeccable, every single scene and movement contributing to the drama as well as looking cool and stylish. It's not enough however just to turn a Romeo and Juliet story into a mob drama, and Loy doesn't neglect this either. You never at any stage (including the violent opening overture) forget that there are other scarcely any less violent passions involved here between Romeo and Giulietta.

Fabio Luisi recognises this too and his conducting of Philharmonia Zrich is remarkable, fully exploring the moods underlying the melodies. If there is rigour in terms of matching the intensity of the music with the dramatic direction, it's only enhanced by a uniformly impressive cast. Joyce DiDonato is not unexpectedly something of a phenomenon as Romeo, convincing in the trouser role if not looking quite as comfortable wearing high boots. The dramatic nature of the role suits her and she sings and plays with real intensity. Olga Kulchynska is a more than capable match as Giulietta, her voice soaring with the high drama. Benjamin Bernheim also makes a very strong impression as Tebaldo.",1471564800,3,3805,4.922118380062305
