8443478,5,B004PGRXC8,"My daughter had the great experience of attending Model Boot Camp with Shawn Ehlers. This dvd is a good overview of the camp for those aspiring models that cannot attend or a good review for those who do. Shawn, a former model, gives helpful advice based on her years of experience in front of the camera on how to move and how to pose. She also trains new models on how to work with the photographer, make-up artist, hair stylists and others on a shoot. Shawn is currently a photographer in NYC as well as a model trainer. She is very personable and helpful and delivers information in a very nice way.",1361923200,,603,4.392857142857143
8443479,5,B004PGRXC8,"I am so impressed with the overall quality of this dvd.  It is packed full of information.  What really helps is not only was Shawn Ehlers a model for years, she is a photographer so she understands both sides of the camera.  She does a fabulous job at clearly explaining how to move in front of a camera for either fashion or commercial photography, how to act on a job, and just what you need to build confidence in front of the camera.  Having modeled over 25 years ago, I found information that I wish I knew then.  Now with a daughter who is interested in modeling, this will be a big help for her.  You will watch it over and over again.  Well worth the cost.",1301356800,,665,4.188976377952756

8443481,5,B004PGRXC8,I just received the Model Moves Video! Just wanted to let you know that the video is fantastic! So much information in the video. What I like best is that you can see what REALLY goes on at a photo shoot! Seeing a model work during a photo shoot on a video is key to learning and understanding the moves and expectations of a model. You can not get this out of a book or magazine! Great job!,1299110400,,391,4.0256410256410255
