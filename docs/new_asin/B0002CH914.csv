8026068,5,B0002CH914,Found out about this show in a room I used to moderate and holy hell is it the best animated series I've ever seen.,1442620800,,115,3.8333333333333335
8026069,5,B0002CH914,"pitch black comedy with sweet downtempo soundtrack and supercool animation (each bit/sketch by a different art team, all with great style)",1423699200,5,138,5.619047619047619
8026070,5,B0002CH914,"In my opinion British Comedy is superior to most American Comedy. (For starters, I hate canned laughter). Its generally a different type of comedy where the British aren't afraid to celebrate aspects of lower economy, the poor and/or unhappy. Or bad teeth.
Monkey Dust is a collection of characters and ideas from different animation houses/people, all unrelated but blended in nicely to one another. The styles of animation changes slightly for each skit but they all seem to have a grimey look to them.
The characters are miserable creatures, whether it be the big headed man who keeps coming up with appalling sexual explanations to his wife of his whereabouts or the father who sees his son once a week only to hear about what his replacement has been up to and then commits suicide, or the first time cottager gathering up his confidence, Monkey Dust is more a black comedy that happens to be in cartoon form, not the other way round. Not for light hearted bunnies.

8026071,5,B0002CH914,"Clever and funny beyond description, I am of the opinion that if this series ever got picked state-side it would have a large and loyal following. A sure fire hit with the adult swim crowd, I can only assume. But that aside, will this series ever be released over here, or is it generally assumed that Americans need their humor dumbed down? Someone please get on the ball and get this outstanding series available to the American public. If you feel the same, please write a review here and let 'em know. Who knows, maybe someone will see and start the ball rolling :)",1186099200,9,569,4.480769230769231
8026072,5,B0002CH914,"Yea, yea, that's overselling it, but you ain't seen nothing like Monkey Dust. It's so addictive, you'll be repeating random lines from all week. Beautifully drawn, it provides a similar outlook toward the world that Sartre and Camus write about.",1177459200,4,245,5.15
8026073,5,B0002CH914,"I first stumbled upon this when channel surfing and became hooked immediately. This dark, surreal animation makes you cringe and laugh at the same time.

I'd recommend it to anyone with a dark sense of humour and a strong stomach. Bring on the series 2 and 3 DVD sets!",1152403200,5,268,4.469387755102041
