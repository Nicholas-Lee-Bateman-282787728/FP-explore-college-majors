990572,5,6305122725,"I have watched all my movies in this set.  Even the silent ones are good, though I do get a little restless needing to sit glued to the set so as not miss anything.  But as a Hitchcock Movie Lover what could I do.  I found my picture and sound good.  No jumping or uneven sections in the movies.  I totally appreciate companies that produce these old movies.",1348704000,3,358,4.205882352941177
990573,3,6305122725,"Alfred Hitchcock is one of cinema's most recognized directors. His face as his signature, he greatly overshadows his own films. And with a face as famous, if not more than, his movies... his image become an advertisement. It is no longer the films that sell. It is Hitchcock.
  This collection is a perfect example. This box set seems to showcase the already well-known face rather than its movies. Each of the fourteen disk cases is haunted by his revered image in the place of a proper movie cover; His name in bold type, three times the size of the movie title. Even on the disk, his face.
  These are some good movies; perfect to complete your collection. I won't deny that this is a good set. These films should be paid more tribute, but until then, they stand under Hollywood's most famous shadow.",1184889600,4,803,4.594405594405594
990574,5,6305122725,"For VHS nostalgists, and those intimidated by the pricey Criterion boxed set that has replaced this (adding ""The Lady Vanishes"" and ""The Thirty-Nine Steps"" and subtracting ""The Paradine Case""), this set is a prize to be sought out.  Anchor Bay put out a good number of clamshell-cased classics in the suspense and horror genres (including letterboxed Argento titles and ""Halloween"") and they also did right by these Forties Hitchcock thrillers.  Of course, these are the films Hitchcock made under the prying eyes of Selznick, and the relationship was sufficiently difficult that Hitch occasionally drifted away from the post-production, allowing Selznick to lave on extra dollops of music and occasionally even reshoot a smidgeon here and there.  ""Notorious"" is the only one here free of Selznick's taint, but that is in large part because it is the only one of these projects to so completely fire Hithcock's imagination that he considered it absolutely vital to maintain his full vision. Regarded as a highwater mark by everyone from Truffaut to Ebert (and Hitchcock himself), its greatness is so pure and consuming as to reduce even these other terrific films almost to the status of filler.  But let us not write them off.  Though they are not the same Minerva-born products of Hitchcock's genius as ""Notorious"" and the Fifties-era masterworks, Selznick was not without his visionary qualities and the Gothic richness of their confections (Hitchcock's ingredients certainly preponderant) make for superb, intoxicating entertainment.  Truffaut rightly hailed the 'very modern' qualities of ""Rebecca"" (the intercutting feels completely contemporary, the forward momentum of the camera through the enormous interiors clearly influenced Kubrick's ""The Shining"", and the opening sequence is as luminously fluid as any feverish dream of Cuaron).  Joan Fontaine is far sexier here than in ""Suspicion"" (the original ""New York Times"" review memorably noted ""Miss Fontaine has the most expressive spine--and shoulders!--we've bothered to notice this season""), and George Barnes' camerawork is similarly sinuous and expressive.  The film's obsessional perversities, like those in ""The Paradine Case"", come through quite nicely.  Alida Valli is the subject of some prime iconic shots in ""The Paradine Case"" (though the screenplay from Selznick's own hand is a bit disjointed, the camera-choreography clearly kept Hitchcock awake).  ""Spellbound"", the one Hitchcock considered least successful of this bunch, was an enormous hit, and though Miklos Rozsa's sensational score may have been too much for what Hitch regarded as the requirements of the piece, it remains a landmark movie score and will certainly seduce the viewer.  Bergman's Dr. Constance Peterson is one-dimensional compared to Alicia in ""Notorious"" but beguiling nonetheless, and watching the somewhat wan Gregory Peck fume at her mothering attentions provides comic counterpoint to its delirious bouts of pop-Freudian obsession and nightmare.  This boxed set comprises a glorious waking dream in luminous black & white, a gorgeous riot of eroticism, fixation, ambiguity, terror, menace and romance rich and seductive enough to keep your nights filled through a long holiday week, and as soon as I have enough nights free I'll be ""renting"" my brother's set off him and subjecting my girlfriend to the whole lot.  Grab it up if you can.",1082505600,19,3391,5.485604606525912

7885388,1,6305122725,"Well, my first review was apparently rejected because someone had issues with the language I used; fine. So, here's the sanitized version. I bought this set without seeing the ""fine print"" that it won't play on DVD players made in the US because of ""area limitations,"" which is apparently a euphemism for ""you live in the wrong hemisphere to play this dvd."" As advanced as technology is, you still can't buy something in one country and expect it to work in another. If I failed to see the disclaimer when I ordered the DVD set, then my bad; buyer beware and all that. However, on a broader note, I would like to add that it is precisely this type of technological nonsense that makes me want to return to #2 pencils and rotary phones.

7885396,5,6305122725,"SPELLBOUND was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and produced by David O. Selznick in 1945. As the story unravels it is essentially a murder plot interwoven around psychiatrists and psychoanalysis. It is actually Alfred Hitchcock's approach to the story and his collaborations with composer Miklos Rozsa and surrealist artist Salvador Dali that highlights this film. Gregory Peck plays John ""J.B."" Ballantine who poses as a psychiatrist while in a state of amnesia. Uncovered by Dr. Constance Peterson played by Ingrid Bergman, Ballantine must find out if he is responsible for the death of the missing psychiatrist that he posed as and simultaneously discover his own identity. Miklos Rozsa's score is both romantic yet eerie as Ballantine tries to remember what happened through analysis of his dreams. Alfred Hitchcock hired Salvador Dali to design illustrations and paintings in order to construct a crisp and vivid rendering of these dreams. Hitchcock did not want to use conventional techniques such as blurred camera shots to recreate the dreams. He wanted them to be as clear and even sharper than the rest of the film. He wanted Dali's style of using shadows, lines of convergence and the idea of infinite distance incorporated into the dream sequences. In the dream sequence we see a black stage highlighted with people at gambling tables with huge mysterious looking eyes peering over them. A man cuts away at the fabric of one eye with a giant scissors revealing another eye. In another part of the dream we see a man standing on a roof behind a chimney that has sprouted roots. The hooded man holds what looks like a deformed or eccentric wagon wheel in his hand. In the distance there is a formation of rocks and boulders, which look like they are sprouting into the shape of a man's head. Another part of the dream shows a man running down a pitched geometric plane as the shadow of a bird follows him. In the background there are geometric shapes and lines that go off into infinity. All these images must be interpreted into experiences from reality. Dali's images are unsettling and thought provoking. Eventually, the eccentric wagon wheel turns out to represent the chambers of a revolver pistol and reveals the true identity of the murderer. A surrealistic painting brings to the canvas an image from reality but puts it into a context of the unreal. I think Dali was successful in translating the realistic elements from the plot into a vision of incomprehensibility of the conscious human mind. Hitchcock and the scriptwriter Ben Hecht then had their characters translate Dali's images back into plausible reality. This is brilliant filmmaking years ahead of its time.

NOTORIOUS is Alfred Hitchcock's wartime romantic thriller. Ingrid Bergman as the daughter of a Nazi spy living in the United States. Her father has been convicted of treason as we see from open doors outside the courtroom. Bergman an amorous and promiscuous playgirl who is reluctantly conscripted by an enigmatic American espionage agent Cary Grant, finds herself in more peril than she bargained for on her assignment in Brazil. This has always been considered one of Hitchcock's better thrillers. NOTORIOUS is absolutely intriguing and deliberately paced. As an Alfred Hitchcock enthusiast it took me some time to realize the power of this film. I even watched this film again before I wrote this review. For me it no longer seems out of step from his other films. In a strange way it jumps ahead to a style Hitchcock employed in 1969's TOPAZ. For me the romanticism combined with Cary Grant introspective performance rank this among Hitchcock's best.

Despite much talk and disagreement as to who contributed what to it, REBECCA is definitely an Alfred Hitchcock film. Producer David O. Selznick hands-on approach to producing definitely is evident, yet the film does not look entirely like your typical Selznick movie for that period. I would think this is director Alfred Hitchcock's doing. Yet again, it does not resemble the style that Hitchcock employed in his first American film, FOREIGN CORESPONDENT. I think a lot of the success of this film should be given to the performances of Joan Fontaine as the young woman who becomes the second wife of Laurence Olivier as the brooding aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter. Laurence Olivier performnce and screen presence as is Maxim de Winter is one of a dashing figure, yet aloof and seemingly enigmatic. Judith Anderson as the stern housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers is the real protagonist of the film and her unsettling performance opposite Joan Fontaine is mesmerizing.

THE PARADINE CASE is an opulent production concerning the elegantly statuesque and enigmatic Mrs. Paradine placed on trial for the murder of her husband. Mrs. Paradine is played with subtle radiance by Alida Valli who embodies the alluring vision of pulchritude that barrister Gregory Peck has created and fallen under the spell of. Gregory Peck's obsessive character is a forerunner to James Stewart's role in Hitchcock's VERTIGO. Obsessive behavior can be destructive as is seen in the relationship that Peck has with his loyal wife portrayed by Ann Todd. However, the greatest role and performance in this film is in the form of Louis Jourdan. Jourdan is an unwavering curiosity in his quixotic role as Mr. Paradine's manservant. His relationship with Mrs. Paradine and her late husband remains a conundrum. Jourdan's performance as a man of steadfast loyalty to both duty and passion is one of brilliance. If there is one Alfred Hitchcock film that is truly misunderstood and underrated it is THE PARADINE CASE.",1382054400,,5626,5.073434125269978
