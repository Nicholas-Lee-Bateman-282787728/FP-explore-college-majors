8168656,3,B000MGBTM0,"My girlfriend loves to salsa and dance, in general.  I purchased this hoping to improve my skills and I found it very limiting given the camera angles that were utilized.  I think most of this is a function of the EXTREMELY small studio in which he recorded the video in.  With a bigger studio better camera angles could be obtained and more footwork and body movement could have been captured in sync.  With this video you get footwork or body movement but never the two together when he is attempting to teach the students, which is extremely annoying.",1202601600,,554,4.622448979591836
