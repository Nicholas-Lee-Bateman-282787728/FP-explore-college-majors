Torgo, a creepy caretaker with giant knees warns a traveling family about The Master. Why is it great? No budget, bad acting, weird plot, completely overdubbed, ant the Master wears this stupid rope with hands on it. Teenagers Battle The Thing has even worse acting, no one shows any emotion. A group of teens unleash a mummified monster, that we the audience don't get to see until the last 5 minutes of the film. And what a monster; it looks like it was quickly sewn together from a moldy carpet. Also, much of the movie uses the ""day for night"" technique, that is when you film during the day, but pretend it's night. The real unsung gem on this dvd is Maniac, an absolute bad movie super classic that easily rivals Plan 9. It's a convoluted mish mosh of story lines, brought to new hights of badness by over the top acting. The movie tries to be part Frankenstein, part The Black Cat, part documentary on psychosis, and part roadside sleaze. Wow!",1331596800,,1101,4.455445544554456
