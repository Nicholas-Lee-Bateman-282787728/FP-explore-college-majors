8702608,1,B00TPN7EJI,"Do you know what separates an informative documentary from a waste of time?  Facts, sources, and credible references.

Despite giving some voice to intellectuals who actually attempt to break down the cold hard facts of the Obama presidency, the way that this documentary is pieced together (and its director) has dumbed-down the argument to a dismissive racial debate between perhaps the least qualified people in society.

Racism is a serious accusation, with those being interviewed as ""The Jury."" Henceforth, those with views pro or against Obama whom either immediately or gradually reveal their religious, racial, or otherwise overtly opinionated view of him should be disqualified as they offer no factual objective resolve to the main question (aside from self-affirmation).

For example, arguments made by Rev. Peterson (as well-presented as they may be at times); his opinions on Obama are clearly religiously-motivated.  It's hard (for the Revrend) to look at only the facts when your idea of the man is that he dececrated the religion and values you spent a lifetime upholding.

The  ""pro Obama"" side of the argument is littered with  ""oblivious racists"" whom don't seem to be fully aware of their own cultural biases/racism.  For example, LA Rivers self-admitingly being conflicted on whether to ""vote for Obama because he's black"" or ""vote for Hillary because she's a woman."" With that mindset, it's  no wonder that chauvenistic narrow-minded bigots (like Trump) have a stage on which to stand.

Answering the central question presented by the narrator at the beginning of the film whether ""Obama is more hated because of his policies or because he's black?"": Well, the answer to that is another question.  By whom do you mean?  If you ask well-read secular scholars with no political motives on  whether or not there's reason to hate him other than his race, you'll find - like any other president - some will agree with his policies and others won't.  Just as some hate him because of his race, others only like him for the same reason -- both sides equally as racist.

Keeping in mind the intricacies of every aspect of Obama's decisions and Impact for the decades to come, without interviewing experts in each respective field, can makeup artist ""Alicia Cabrera"" and her salon patrons really provide us with an answer (on how impactful Obama was for better or worse)?

Leaving such a question on the public stage to be answered by some downright foolish and/or self-serving comentators presented as our ""Jury"" is almost insulting to the leadership.  It's inherently socially irresponsible given the commentators seem to be only affirming their religious or racial biases as the sole reasoning.  This takes away from the overall credibility of the documentary, let alone the depth of the commentators' perspective.

Worst yet the documentary further cultivates and validates that our cultural biases should dictate our decision-making (as presented by both the interviewed salon patrons and black celebrities such as LA Rivers).. He comments are just as racist/sexist as say Donald Trump  voting for Hillary or Romney instead of Obama because they're white, and Obama is black.

Black pride is the same as white pride. When it impacts social or political decisions, it's just ugly, hardcore, bonafide racism. Likewise is sexism disguised as feminism.

  This review is coming from someone who would vote for a 3rd term Obama presidency if possible.",1467849600,,3465,5.177737881508079

Obama is originally from the Southern Virginia/North Carolina area.  He was arrested several times for adult on boy pedophilia.  He was part of a homosexual cult in the Ivor/Suffolk,VA area called the Luther-dons.  He had several sexual occasion with political members in these areas and they expunged his records and neglected to come forward with the truth, in order to engage like our real politicians engage.  Most fathers are working not stocking young boys to restrain them for sexual favors and in and out of homeless shelters.

No Saturday mail... Obamacare ..lol!  I am not a racist but, the first Black President was a  homosexual scam artist,Treasonous bastard, and  liar... no wonder the Black Caucus didn't support his presidency.

He wanted a financial gain and to rise above the superior credential our country has earned for over 200 years.  All he got in return was a titular form of power with a superior title no one would recognize.  QUIT CENSORING THE PRESS FOR YOUR SELFISH ATTITUDE AND EXPRESSIONS...QUIT STOCKING OUR TAX REFUNDS! WE THE PEOPLE FORM THIS GOVERNMENT NOT A DISABLED CULT FROM VIRGINIA!  DON'T EVER LIE TO OUR GOVERNMENT AGAIN... AMERICA CARES!",1457222400,2,1233,5.197969543147208

8702612,5,B00TPN7EJI,Don't need a documentary to answer this question. Interesting documentary and the irony is that the same people rating this documentary low are the same people this documentary talks about. I always get confused when people talk about how terrible the President is especially when Bush slid his way out of office as the economy crashed. Nonetheless a good documentary but examines the sad state of racism in America.,1453075200,7,416,5.043478260869565
8702613,2,B00TPN7EJI,"I am neither black, nor white, but my inclination is to look through the lens of a minority when seeing this sort of documentary because I am a minority.  That being said, I found this documentary to be full of wholes within the first 10 minutes.  In asking the question if people hate Obama because he is black, it was very apparent that they were targeting people who love Obama because he is black... .which is an extremely slanted point of view, and hard one to back up.  When one of the ladies stated, ""I didn't know whether to vote for the female or for the black guy...I was confused,"" it quickly became clear that this wasn't truly asking a question, it was trying to prove a point.  If you are confused you can't decide between a female or a black person because you are both, then it means you aren't voting for the RIGHT person, and everything else that comes out of your mouth is suspect.  I think the idea of this is intriguing, but I hope someone comes along who really wants to answer the question.  And yes, the government has been shut down with white presidents before.  It was not something that just happened because we now had a black president.  Someone should have fact checked.",1452902400,12,1201,4.4520547945205475

8702615,4,B00TPN7EJI,"When you watch a documentary you have to realize that the film maker behind the movie you are watching will almost always have an opinion on his subject matter far in advance of his making the movie. It is the rare occasion where this isn't true and perhaps the only type of film that comes close are true cinema verite films where the camera merely follows the inhabitants of the story that evolves in front of you. The majority of documentary films being made these days revolve around politics and those on both sides of the political spectrum come to the table with their own agendas well in hand.

What makes many of these interesting once they arrive is that few these days seem to fact check the information they offer or selectively edit out what they know will harm the basis of their film. Michael Moore is notorious for doing this going so far as to create scenes in his films and then trying to pretend they just happened. Sadly, and some may argue this, the majority of documentary films these days are made by those who have a left leaning ideology which means that a balanced number of films are not being made. On top of that a number of these films are demolished once released when fact checking them shows the faults in their reportage. With everyone having easy access to finding answers behind the lies online it makes the film makers seem either lazy or just propagandists.

As HATING OBAMA opens it seems as if that might be the case here. It begins by asking the question Do people hate President Obama because of his policies or because he is black? Within the first 20 minutes of this already short film we are presented with people talking about President Obama and praising everything he does. Those filmed include activists and actors, playwrights and street people. None of them will be names you will recognize. Even radio talk show hosts being talked to are regional at best and unknown to me; perhaps others will recognize them.

Included in that time we are also presented with images of blacks in this country being hosed, beaten, having dogs unleashed on them, being subjected to the most hateful signs and images KKK rallies. But it doesnt take long to notice that all of these negative images are not current at all. Almost all of them come from the 60s, over 50 years ago. While talking about the amount of racism in this country those who feel it exists in the most extreme measure seem to think the U.S. today hasn't changed over those 50 years. If that were the case wouldnt we have more current footage that could be used, especially with the 24 hour news cycles stations in existence today? And if it were true then how was it that a black man was elected to the highest office in the country to begin with?

I was about to give up on the film when things began to change. Suddenly there were black commentators, authors and preachers who were talking about the subject at hand. These were not white politicians or liberals claiming that they felt guilty about white privilege, these were black individuals who were talking about the current President and how unhappy they were with him. The chance of claiming their views were based on racism was an impossible task. But through their being included in the discussion it demonstrated that the film maker here wasn't trying to present only one side of the coin. He was indeed trying to discuss the topic in question with an even hand.

Even more surprising to me was that those who were presenting arguments against the President did so in a way that discussed his policies and politics rather than simply claiming he was wrong. They discussed verifiable facts that could be researched once the film was over. They talked about how he was elected as someone who would represent the black cause in this country but who has used policies that have actually harmed the black community instead, things like the fact that the unemployment level for blacks in this country has risen since he took office rather than decline.
On the other hand those who support the President are surprising as well. Their reasons for thinking his policies have worked revolve around two things. The first is that they personally have received a benefit from his policies, such as the lady who says she now has insurance and visits the doctor once a month now. I don't know about anyone else but I don't really know anyone who makes monthly doctor appointments no matter how great their insurance is. The second supporters are those who think he is wonderful for no reason other than that he is black. They don't care about his policies, what he accomplishes or harms or anything other than the fact that he is black. Would this not constitute reverse racism? I don't know but it seems like it might.

By the end of the film I have little doubt that anyone watching will probably not be swayed one way or the other. If you walk in thinking there is nothing wrong with this President then you will ignore those people talking about why they disagree with his policies. If you don't like his policies you will agree with the statement one man who ran for office makes that he won't be stopped because the minute you disagree with anything he says you are immediately proclaimed to be a racist. Perhaps the most telling interview in the film comes from a patron of a salon who praises him, talks about the wonderful things she and her friends now have and when it comes to anyone who disagrees with his policies then f**k them! Hardly a well thought out argument but one that many use when their only reason is what they can get from someone.

The movie is interesting as it progresses and the arguments on both sides are telling by what they say and how those making statements view things. While I have little doubt in my mind that there are pockets of racism remaining in this country today it is nowhere near what it was in the 50s, 60s and before. As long as those who argue against racism in this country try to paint it that way their voices are likely to go unheard except by those they wish to foment into riotous masses. Those willing to have a civil discussion on the topic are more likely to be part of not only the discussion but the solution.

The film maker behind this film, Marquis Smalls, should be given credit for tackling a serious topic and bringing both sides of the issue to the forefront. While the film begins one way it ends by offering both sides of the issue, leaving the viewer to consider everything theyve heard and seen in the past 107 minutes. Thats what a documentary film maker should aspire to, presenting the entire spectrum of the issue they choose to make a movie about. Michael Moore, whos been around long enough to know better, would do well to take lessons from Mr. Smalls.",1433894400,13,6784,4.573190789473684
