2551384,3,B000F4RHSO,"I agree with the reviewer who noted that the original mini-series was more like 200 minutes long & included a lot more interesting background. I recorded the original broadcast, & was very disappointed in the abbbreviated version. Hopefully the longer version will be released on DVD before my VHS copy wears out....",1171238400,9,316,5.096153846153846
2551385,2,B000F4RHSO,"I watched this on the WE station 10/16/06 with commercials. I must assume it was not the abreviated version as there was Part I and Part II. Seymour was very good, altho when I saw her in the credits I could not believe she would be playing Callas. Onassis was a short, not too handsome a man and the casting was not good here altho a fine actor, J. is tall and handsome. The contrast between Onassis/Jackie would have been more real with another actor nearer to Onassis' looks/stature...  The Jackie actress was super.

Young Onassis had a gay affair with the Turkish soldier for self preservation? Has this been known?

I agree the reason for Jackie marrying him was known but well scripted in this movie. I thought Onassis' quote (I assume) that women all marry for money was interesting. In Jackie's case it was a matter of price. She ended up living in NY and without fear.

Worth a look. Rent if you can. A bit different than the Anthony Quinn/Bisset TV movie.",1161043200,5,966,4.502857142857143
2551386,2,B000F4RHSO,"According to a couple of internet sources, this DVD is a drastically truncated version of what was originally a 200 min. miniseries.  This could explain many of my problems with the film, which seems to skip briefly over the biographical and emotional high points of Aristotle Onassis's life, without giving us much insight into his character or much depth to his romantic relationships.  Jane Seymour won an Emmy for her portrayal of Maria Callas, but I suspect that much of her performance that prompted the award has been cut from this DVD, leaving mostly over-the-top moments (even in the context of the character being played) from this usually very subtle actress.  While I admire Raul Julia's body of work, I think he may have been miscast as Onassis.  While, again, more subtle, character revealing aspects of his performance may show up in the full version of the film, his acting choices here were awkward and abrupt, and he never convinced me that Onassis was anything more than a shallow, unpleasant, not particularly interesting character who never would have a film made of him were it not for his wealth and taste in women.  Anthony Quinn (who here is cast as Onassis's father), at a (not too much) younger age would have done a better job of portraying what I suspect the scriptwriter wanted us to see in Onassis:  a charming, often likeable rogue.  The most powerful emotional moment on this DVD came from  Francesca Annis as Jacqueline Kennedy, who convincingly conveyed what was probably the core reason for the latter's marriage to Onassis:  stark fear that her entire family would share the same violent fate as John and Robert Kennedy, resulting in her search for protection.  I hope that a full version of this miniseries will be released on DVD, so that viewers can discover how much more depth to Onassis's story might be found in the missing 82 minutes.",1156723200,14,1879,4.84375

2551419,5,B000F4RHSO,"Raul Julia played another great role in this one.  He was an awesome actor.  I love the scene in this movie where a friend of Onassis complains that his daughter wants to marry a fisherman, while he (the father) wanted her to marry ""a businessman.""  Onassis commands his (presumably rich) friend ""Then buy your future son-in-law a fishing boat.  Then your Daughter WILL marry a businessman.""",1391472000,3,391,4.878787878787879
2551420,4,B000F4RHSO,"rather good movie and very surprise about his past with his life in turkey as a young 16 year old was included.the acting was rather good by all actors in the movie..disappointed they omitted dates .it didn't go very deep in any subject.jane seymore was supberb as maria callas.she should have receive an award for her portrayer as maria callas.all I read in the media was in this movie.so that's why I rated it so high.just would have been better if they included the dates when events happen.onassis was the man of his time!!I don't blame Jackie for marring him.i can see how she even fell in love with him.he is flamboughent.pamper his friends and guest.there  never be another man like onassis.just wish they would have done deeper subjects on his life.he hAD A INTERESTING AND FANTASTIC LIFE.AS HIS MOTTO WAS""THE RULES ARE THERE ARE NO RULES""GOES TO SHOW HOW VERY LITTLE HIS LIFE IS KNOWN.HOPEFULLY HIS GRANDDAUGHTER WILL WRITE A BOOK ON HIS LIFE.",1381708800,,952,4.7696969696969695
2551421,5,B000F4RHSO,"Arrived as stated and I enjoyed the show...I met Jane Seymour in Zageb while she was filming a made for TV movie, so this made it especially enjoyable. Also I am a huge fan of Maria Callas!",1372032000,,189,4.135135135135135
2551422,2,B000F4RHSO,"If, as another reviewer has mentioned, this version has been cut from an original 200 munite version, then this could explain why it comes across as just another shallow made-for-TV bio pic. Watching this current 2-hour version, one can only come to the conclusion that Onassis was interesting only because he was rich, because Maria Callas was his mistress, and because he married Jackie Kennedy. There was no real insight as to how he made his fortune, which would have been much more interesting than a film whose only focus was on Onassis' womanizing. Raul Julia has proven that he is a fine actor with good material (Kiss Of The Spider Woman comes immediately to mind), but he is undone here by a very unimaginative script. Jane Seymour is not bad, though there's nothing here that hints as to why she won an Emmy, and her lip-synching of Callas leaves much to be desired.",1350000000,,877,4.701298701298701
2551423,3,B000F4RHSO,"This is a very good overview of Onassis' controversial and legendary life. His accomplishments are incredible and watching this well-produced TV movie drama, you get alot of insight into his life. Jane Seymour gives an incredible performance as Maria Callas, which is a whole other story upon itself. Raul Julia also gives a great performance. It centers more on the relationship between Onassis and Callas, and unfortunately not enough about his own family, such as his daughter Christina. It could have been more picturesque and cinematography could've been much better. The time period was very glamourous, but this film doesn't capture that essence. It does however capture the dynamics between he and Callas. Overall it's good, but the quality could have been much better, because it's just a made-for-TV movie.",1298073600,,816,5.2846153846153845
2551424,5,B000F4RHSO,Very well done.  It respects the true story from the beginning to the end.,1227484800,,74,4.285714285714286
2551425,3,B000F4RHSO,"The death of Raul Julia closed the door to a career still peaking. This film provides one of his great showcases, and fans will savor his powerhouse performance.

Taken as a Citizen Kane-type film about a self-made Greek billionaire, this is very entertaining and would be an excellent story. However, as a biography of Aristotle Onassis it falls flat.

For starters, Julia looks nothing like Onassis. He's the wrong height, build, nationality, and is certainly much handsomer. Though great to watch, he never is able to convince you that he is Onassis.

Supporting cast is unimpressive. Elias Koteas is awkward in his first-act showcase as young Aristotle, and I can't see how Jane Seymour received an Emmy for her overblown performance, while Julia was not even nominated. Francisca Annis fairs better as Jackie Kennedy, but the presentation of Jackie is too quaint for it's own good; all information provided can be found in an encyclopedia entry.

Oddly enough, Anthony Quinn as Julia's father looks significantly more like Onassis than Julia, but his hammy appearance indicates why he would not have served well in the main role.

Recommended strongly for fans of Raul Julia, everyone else would probably not be interested.",1221264000,2,1228,5.12

8117419,3,B000F4RHSO,"This version of the tv mini-series movie has been edited entirely too much.  It should have been a two-disc set. Expanding it onto two discs would have allowed for more of its original content to have been shown so that you could have enjoyed it as if you were watching the original release minus the commercials.
Had it not been due to the editing of this movie, I could've given it a five star rating.",1476230400,3,403,4.373333333333333

8117424,3,B000F4RHSO,"Despite a few good moments, the film was just okay. As a bio of the Greek tycoon, the film tries to explain his rise to wealth as well as the temperment and passion of Aristotle Onassis. The movie starts with Raul Julia (as a young self-assured adult Aristotle) doing a Greek dance (like Fiddler on the Roof) on a rocky beach. This opening scene is followed by a narrative by people (such as Maria Callas played by Jane Seymour) who knew and were involved with Aristotle Onassis to chronicle his life. Francesca Annis' portrayal of Jackie Kennedy lacked so much depth to the point where she did not even resemble the real life person. Anthony Quinn, comfortable with a Greek role, did a good job playing Ari's father. Though you come away from the film understanding Ari a little better, the acting and storytelling are tortured and sub-par - almost boring at times.",1438214400,,866,4.666666666666667
