Moreover, the footage of the trains of that era are wonderful and informative. The train themes initially brought me to her films and it's enriched my life tremendously. She is a woman I would have love to have met, if only her era hadn't died so soon.  I would love to see more of her films become available in the future. I'd give it 5 stars if the story had been better and her acrobatics had been similar to 10 years earlier.

By the way, does anyone know if she had any natural children? I have not been able to find that out. Wonderful woman none the less!",1445817600,,721,4.255474452554744

8514971,3,B007DIQAEW,"Helen Holmes is one of the great female figures in early 20th Century American film history. She was often portrayed as an equal, and sometimes superior, to her male counterparts in her various film roles. Helen's astounding feats of daring were often performed herself without help from stunt personnel. And there were times when she was almost killed performing some of her stunts.

There were two Helen Holmes features entitled ""The Lost Express."" The first was made in 1917 and was about a railroad magnate who is kidnapped and his private train hijacked by a gang that wants the formula for a new type of gasoline.

""The Lost Express"" presented in this DVD edition is a very loose remake from 1926. In it, railroad magnate John Morgan somehow takes temporary custody of his little granddaughter in an attempt to get his daughter and her husband to quit feuding and to reunite as a family.

Morgan decides to take his granddaughter for a ride on his private train. In the meantime, the train is hijacked and Morgan and his staff are held for ransom. The crooks move the train to a forgotten railroad spur deep in the woods, thus the title of the movie, ""The Lost Express.""

For some reason, not made clear in the film, the granddaughter, portrayed by adorable six-year-old child actor Lassie Lou Ahern, ends up in the baggage car of another train (I think). At a rural depot, Helen Holmes is working as a telegraph operator. When the train arrives, the baggage man hands Lassie Lou over to Helen who immediately begins a search for the child's parents.

""The Lost Express"" is a very low budget film that is only about 45 minutes long. The plot is meandering, disjointed, and often confusing. And there are precious few scenes  of Helen doing any of her daring railroad stunts of which she was so famous. By 1926, Helen was 34 years old which may account for the sparse amount of action on her part.

Unfortunately, Alpha's DVD of ""The Lost Express"" does not present Helen Holmes in the best of light. The film's quality is fair to good at best, and is often washed out with somewhat fuzzy focus. The background music is okay, but nothing great.

The bonus featurette ""In Danger's Path"" (1915) is actually Chapter 33 of Helen's mammoth 119 chapter silent serial ""The Hazards of Helen.""  It is a fast-paced little ten minute railroad adventure, but the picture quality is only poor to fair.

Hopefully, Helen Holmes, Pearl White, and other female cinematic trailblazers will one day receive the ""star treatment"" they so richly deserve when it comes to future DVD releases.",1384041600,4,2574,4.751121076233184
