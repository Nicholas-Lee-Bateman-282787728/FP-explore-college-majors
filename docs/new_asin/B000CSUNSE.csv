8102160,4,B000CSUNSE,"I started watching these ""Hollywood Rivals"" on YouTube some years earlier, and when I found them on Amazon, I was very enthusiastic about ordering them. All of the episodes are here, each approximately 45 minutes in length. Of course, as a previous reviewer has said, die-hard fans of these ladies and gentlemen won't learn any new, because what is told here is basically the bare-minimum information on each of the parties involved. It's very clear that the narrator was pressed for time as he speaks at a rapid pace. Much of the information, however, is a little fuzzy; I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of the information here is just rumors pressed together to make a mini and not-so-good biography. The only reason to really have these episodes are to have little documentaries on stars that don't have enough documentaries dedicated to them.

These are decent, I guess, little biographies of each of the above stars, etc. mentioned. They are a fairly decent way to kill an hour, especially when you have nothing else to do or nothing better to watch. As my heading states, these aren't great, but they're certainly okay.",1436400000,2,1905,4.775075987841945
8102161,4,B000CSUNSE,"This set of shows may have aired on cable or somewhere, but I never saw it if that was the case.  The 5 disc set features over 20 hours of programming on the various stars presented.  Footage is often from trailers but is extensive and  there are also some actors who knew and worked with these stars giving some short takes which is interesting.  The episodes are not, as someone else pointed out on the quality and depth of the A&E series, but the shows are entertaining and certainly provide some thought provoking ideas.  I especially liked the Astaire/Kelly episode. There is a wide variety of subjects as well,covering much of the history of American movies.  I knew some of this material but did learn or reconsider some information,  making this a very entertaining series, especially for this price.",1398556800,2,808,4.76978417266187
8102162,3,B000CSUNSE,"I was actually expecting more from this than what I got. What you get is a bunch of film clips, interviews, and choppy biographies. Odds are if you know anything about these stars, you already know what these episodes are going to tell you. Despite the ""Hollywood Rivals"" title, in the majority, there is few reference to their rivalry. Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield were both blonde sex symbols are were rivals to a certain degree, but there is little noting to their rivalry. Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth are paired because they each were World War II pin-ups, but were is the rivalry? Some of the better ones are Bette Davis vs. Joan Crawford, which may be the best of the batch. The ones nearing the end about Movies vs. TV and Lassie vs. Rin Tin-Tin are the worst in my opinion. In essence, these are for people who are clueless about these people and want what little information these will give. They're not disappointing, but often live the viewer asking: ""Where was their rivalry?""",1398470400,,997,4.670454545454546
8102163,4,B000CSUNSE,"These Passport DVD releases tend to get a bad rap because they rely on public domain footage, but just because film is free to use doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.

Every rivalry presented has a very healthy 44 minute length, with equal time donated to both participants.  Format is a biography of each actor going back and forth with sporadic interviews from involved parties, as well as clips.  Hardcore fans of either actor is not likely to learn anything new, but because there's such a variety any film fan is bound to know less about certain feuds than others, so you get a crash course on performers whose name you may recognize but you may know little about.

I rather like that most of the footage are trailers because, firstly, it is fascinating to watch how certain movies were presented at the time they were released, and secondly, because it forces the documentary to examine careers on a film-by-film basis, which I personally enjoy in Hollywood biographies more than broad strokes and endless talk of their persona mixed with interchangeable accolades.

At the affordable price, you're basically getting what you pay for.  Film fans looking for light entertainment and to-the-point biographies of many actors who have few documentaries donated to them will be pleased.",1350000000,5,1285,4.981308411214953
