8588030,1,B001NZ3DJG,"This DVD was horrible; it wasn't a seminar, or hypnosis sessions.  It was just people sitting around eating cheese, talking.  Watching it was like actually sitting in the room with the people discussing abduction only A.) i couldn't participate in the conversation and B.) I wasn't high enough to care what they had to say.  Dr. Whatever-her-name is can't stay on topic long enough for me to even remotely considering anything she has to say as valid or interesting.  I hope everyone involved in this DVD contracts some type of STD.",1253491200,,532,4.813186813186813
