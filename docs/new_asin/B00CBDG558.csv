8579726,4,B00CBDG558,"If you like anime in which the protagonist goes back in time, this is a good show to watch. I was just annoyed by how easily the protagonist was manipulated. I was annoyed by how the friend was a jerk and was not held accountable for her actions. That made me believe the writers did not spend the time needed to make the characters and the story cohesive. Besides that, the overall premise was fun and the show was interesting.",1521244800,,428,4.3625

8579730,1,B00CBDG558,"First there is no reason to watch this. Mayo is an evil, stuck up b** *h who reminds me of Stroke Face. There is no redeemable quality that she has and her back story is so pathetic that it doesn't give her an excuse for her actions. Oh boo hoo! My parents don't get along! Boo hoo oh f*****g well! She should have died miserably then maybe I would have rated this waste of an OVA 2 stars. The CG in Sailor Moon Crystal looks way better than the ugly CG you see here. Skip this! It has nothing to do with the original manga by Yuu Watase.",1457049600,,538,3.990740740740741
8579731,5,B00CBDG558,Once you have one season of Fushigi Yugi you need to have them all.,1431302400,,67,3.857142857142857
8579732,5,B00CBDG558,"You could watch this by itself. But it's a whole lot better, and makes more sense, if you've watched the first 2 seasons of Fushigi Yugi. So it's a great follow-up to those 2 box sets. Comedy, action, romance, drama!",1374105600,4,216,4.425
