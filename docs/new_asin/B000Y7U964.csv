8231032,5,B000Y7U964,"This DVD went out of print way too quickly and to find it at such a great price, well, enough said. Anyone who is a fan of blues and rock should really check this out, then immediately buy all of Doyle's CDs as the music is all covered on this disc. Absolutely worth buying!!",1389571200,,275,4.111111111111111
8231033,1,B000Y7U964,"Sorry guys, and for the fans, but...(and honestly I'm not even sure what the hell Clapton/Waters have found on this guy, as there must be hundreds at this level)...but after hearing him playing with Clapton and Waters, two of my heroes, and on the Croosroads Festival several times he got my attention as honestly he was good. Here he was simply bored and uninspired, yes, unique, but in the way of unbearableto be listen to...after three or four tracks, sorry I had to remove this video and forget about it. Bonamassa, Kenny, Eric Johnson.... and even John Mayer and Jonny Lang, that are not my cup of tea at all, sound a lot better to me than this guy...Clapton even compared him with SRV, and called him unique in comparison...Sorry Clapton, but not sure what you were smoking, but must be really good...",1370131200,,807,4.65034965034965
8231034,5,B000Y7U964,"I'm the biggest of DBII fans, but even with that being said watching Doyle, J.J. and Mike lay down their Austin brand of blues for the people of China at the base of The Great Wall of China is awe inspiring.  Great song selection and watching Doyle play left-handed on a guitar strung upside down with precision, feedback and fire makes this a must own for any blues fan.",1350604800,,371,4.3768115942028984
8231035,5,B000Y7U964,"Doyle Bramhall ii Live from The Great Wall of China DVD is SPECTACULAR!  Number one Doyle is an amazingly talented singer,songwriter,guitarist.  To have this show performed in front of the Great Wall of China is breathtaking.  THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA not a facade.  Two giant dragons on each side!  The temple in the background.  A huge polished mirror like stage!  Chinese stone soldiers on either side of the stage!  Smoke billowing out from somewhere.  Thousands of Chinese people trying to figure out WTF is going on!  Best of all is Doyle singing and playing his ass off! Great three piece band with Mike Elizondo on bass and JJ Johnson on drums.  I don't care what Roger Waters does with his wall he cannot duplicate this.
Doyle is playing sideman to a lot of rockstars these days including Roger Waters, Eric Clapton, Sheryl Crow and others.  Doyle is also playing around with his old band the Arc Angels.  This is all great but Doyle needs to be putting out his own music.  All three of Doyle's solo albums are awesome.
Message to Doyle ""Please put out more of your own CD's, DVD's and tour""!!!
PS: ""Give you my heart"" is a great song.  This song needs to be released and given some air time.........

8231036,5,B000Y7U964,"Doyle Bramhall II is from Texas, he was highly influenced by Stevie Ray Vaughan. He plays the guitar, left-handed. He is a ""Blues-Oriented"" guitarist, and is simply an outstanding Guitarist, and this DVD proves it. I found out about Doyle, by watching Eric Clapton's 2007 Guitar Festival DVD. On Disc two of that set, you get Doyle, along with another great guitarist, Derek Trucks playing along with Eric, in several of Eric's songs on disc two. (Note: that particular dvd, does not list them as players, but they are.) Anyway, I was very impressed with Doyle, so I bought this DVD.

This DVD contains some commentaries, during the concert, from Eric Clapton, Sheryl Crow, Doyle, & others. However, these commentaries ""flow with the music"", and serve as an ""introduction"", and ""explanation"" of Doyle's guitar playing style. They didn't seem to disrupt the concert to me. The performance portions are simply outstanding, and well worth watching, even with the commentaries.

The line-up consists of the following:
Doyle Bramhall II - guitar & vocals
Mike Elizaondo - bass
J.J. Johnson - Drums

The Song set is as follows:
1. I Wanna Be
2. Chariot
3. Smokestack
4. Who I Am
5. I'm Leavin'
6. Flesh
7. Time
8. Green Light Girl

Bonus Songs Include:
1.& 2. Eric Clapton & Doyle Bramhall II - ""TerraPlane Blues"" & ""Milk Cow Blues"" - These are Robert Johnson Classic's.
3. Sheryl Crow & Doyle Bramhall II - ""Pride & Joy"" the Stevie Ray Vaughan Classic. (This is a very outstanding performance, with Sherly Crow singing the vocals.)
4. Roger Waters & Doyle Bramhall II - ""Comfortably Numb"" - The Pink Floyd Classic. (This is another outstanding performance, with Doyle providing some of the vocals, along with Roger Waters, plus it showcases some of Doyle's guitar playing skills.)

Interviews include:
Doyle Bramhall II.
Eric Clapton.
Mike Elizodo.

Overall, this is a great guitar-oriented concert dvd. I enjoyed the commentaries, the interviews and the performances. Doyle is an ""awesome"" guitar player!!! This is a great concert DVD, and I highly recommend it. Thanks!!!!",1247270400,2,2069,4.982608695652174
8231037,4,B000Y7U964,"I first heard about DB2 in the early 90's when Arc Angels put out their record. It was a breath of fresh air. I've followed everything both Doyle Bramhall II and Charlie Sexton have done since then and was excited to see that this was being released.

Well filmed, great location, good interviews included (although some of the footage of Eric Clapton is the same as the Before the Music Dies interviews) and good extra 'stuff' like 'Comfortably Numb' from the Roger Waters DVD, SRV's ""Pride and Joy"" with Sheryl Crow (keeping the strings on the neck tuned that low is astounding), some footage from the Robert Johnson DVD that Eric Clapton put out a while ago. As well as a cool mini rendition of ""He Stole Our Love Away"" from his s/t CD amongst other 'stuff'.

There's also a great spot about 3/4 of the way through the set when drummer JJ Johnson goes through about 4 sticks in the space of about 5 bars, but still keeps things together.

The only knocks I would have on it is the audio (at least on the copy I have) is a bit inconsistent. The first few tunes are strong and then it almost seems like they lost the ""real"" mix they had and had to rely on the crowd mics a bit more, but you never know.  Only other spot is some editing early on where what Doyle is playing and what is being shown isn't the same. Not sure if they fixed it in post or if it was just a weird video edit, but it's a very minor thing.

DB2 is the real deal. Tremendously inspiring. Don't accept substitutes. I won't mention names. You owe it to yourself to check this out, then buy ""Jellycream"" and ""Welcome"" and his s/t recording, then buy the Arc Angels disc and then buy one for everyone you know. Thanks.",1218672000,6,1688,4.29559748427673
8231038,4,B000Y7U964,"DB2 is among a handful of guitarists today that will be talked about in the same way clapton, santana and dare i say....hendrix are considered the greats that they are.
trust me and see him live and you will see what i mean.
and did i mention, he plays a right-handed-strung guitar left-handed.
in other words.........upside down.",1214870400,2,330,4.807017543859649
8231039,3,B000Y7U964,"I'VE ALWAYS LIKED DOYLE'S PLAYING AND WAS EXCITED TO SEE THIS SHOW, HOWEVER THE VIDEO PRODUCERS DECIDED TO SPLICE INTERVIEWS INTO THE SHOW AND THAT WAS A MAJOR DISTRACTION FOR ME. THAT MEANS THAT EVERY TIME YOU WATCH THE SHOW, THERE ARE THE INTERVIEWS. THEY COULD HAVE DONE IT AS A BONUS AT THE END. THAT SAID, THE CONCERT IS VERY GOOD OVERALL.I ONLY GAVE IT 3 STARS FOR THAT REASON.",1211414400,4,383,4.408450704225352
8231040,5,B000Y7U964,"Years later, I still listen once in a week his Welcome album. I love Jellycream too. I truly understand why giants like Roger Waters and Eric Clapton wanted him. Great songs, great guitar, great vocals, new style in blues-rock. Listen to ""I Wanna Be"": its solo is so groovy. And ""Smokestack"" knocked me out by its raw intensity. What a feeling ! I hope he will seriously make HIS way in the future...

PS. JJ Johnson on drums is just perfect. As always.",1209945600,3,453,4.457831325301205
