5524884,5,B00AWWGOHE,"Bit of a slower speed than I am used to (being a former road racer) this still has beautiful scenery to ride or jog to.
This must have been an awfully time-consuming venture as Argyll is pretty darn rainy and this is all in beautiful sunshine......piecing together the film must have taken years!!",1455148800,,297,4.622641509433962
5524885,4,B00AWWGOHE,It was okay. Better than most.,1453852800,,30,4.166666666666667
5524886,5,B00AWWGOHE,"Update 7/2/2015:  I went out and bought a cheap DVD player from Walmart and the DVD plays great. I watch it everyday while I am using my stationary exercise bike. I am very pleased and will probably be purchasing more videos.

This is a great video! My only issue with it is it will not play on my PS4....which is the only device I have set up in my living room for playing Blue-rays and DVDs (which is where my stationary bike is located).  :(  In order for me to watch it I have to stick it on my computer and stream from my TV. In doing so the quality has gone to crap. Maybe I'll just break down and buy a $25 DVD player at Walmart and be done with it.",1431129600,,656,3.946969696969697
5524887,5,B00AWWGOHE,"Anything in Scotland is Beautiful.  Can't go wrong with this.
Waiting for more from Scotland.... even tours of Castles and walking through forests.",1429056000,,147,5.391304347826087
5524888,5,B00AWWGOHE,great walking dvd. AAA+++++,1415836800,,27,6.0
5524889,5,B00AWWGOHE,"This DVD is just what I was looking for - something that would mimic going for a ride in the country.  I know there are other dvds out there that offer multiple timed rides at a variety of speeds.  But the more it seems like an exercise routine, the less likely I am to use it.  The route is very picturesque, complete with the sounds of nature you are passing by.  The quality of the picture is so good it makes me feel like I am on the road instead of in my living room.  In fact at one point it looked like we might miss the curve we were coming up on and my reaction was to put on my brakes.  It certainly takes the boredom out of exercising.  I take care of my mom and she enjoys watching the dvd while I am on my bike, which allows me to use it more often.  She has even told me to ""slow down"" or ""be careful"" a time or two.  I will definitely be purchasing more of VITA Digital Productions' bike rides in the near future.",1409788800,11,928,3.9197860962566846
5524890,5,B00AWWGOHE,"An excellent DVD to watch while on a treadmill or exercise bike.  The scenery is both lush and varied and the image remains steady while in motion.  The 10-15 MPH speed is too fast for those who walk at a slow pace on a treadmill but perfect for joggers and bicyclists.  Plus, it doesn't have those annoying screen wipes that occur on so many other videos of this type.  This company features an excellent variety of DVDs with filmed locations both in the US and overseas.",1407283200,6,472,4.453488372093023
5524891,5,B00AWWGOHE,"After doing Ancestry.com for a solid 3 months (every night/3 to 4 hours a night), we wanted to visualize the scenery rather than look at YouTube videos and images online. Great price and goes well in our ancestral video library.",1380499200,4,228,4.725
8558657,4,B00AWWGOHE,"Beautiful photography, good routes. I am looking for scenery to watch while biking indoors- this fit that bill.",1525392000,,111,5.222222222222222
8558658,5,B00AWWGOHE,Just what I was looking for! I have walked many times in this area so the scenery brought back memories for me. It kept my attention and made it easy to exercise - something I am not fond of doing! Very happy with the quick delivery from the seller. Will order more!,1505433600,,266,4.134615384615385
8558659,4,B00AWWGOHE,"This review is for Scenic Argyll Scotland Virtual Jog & Bike Ride Scenery DVD.  I purchased a few DVD's and while this one isn't as fast paced as some and the scenes really don't change dramatically....I really did enjoy it.  The scenery was beautiful, sunny, green, some animals and quite tranquil.  I'd walk/jog/bike with this one anytime.  I'd say it was about a medium pace I would guess and there was up and down paths/roads and around curves.  There were a few points where you stopped to take in the view and quite a few sheep running around.  I enjoyed it because during the winter this is exactly what I want to see....sun, flowers, everything green and even though this was Scotland it looked so much like the paths around me (minus those sheep). ;)  I'd recommend it.",1500940800,,778,4.594202898550725
8558660,1,B00AWWGOHE,Boring as hell.  Unless you like sheep.  Lots and lots of sheep.,1498262400,,64,4.25
8558661,5,B00AWWGOHE,"These are really interesting.  I love them, and they are very realistic.  I've even experienced a little vertigo when I went down a hill and around a corner, which is a strange experience on a bike trainer. If you want to try this, it's a good, high quality, DVD.",1488585600,,263,4.346938775510204
8558662,5,B00AWWGOHE,These videos are gorgeous and help break the monotony of the treadmill.  I actually have put them on while I'm working around the house so they are just playing in the background.,1482969600,,179,4.59375
8558663,5,B00AWWGOHE,"I like this ride very much. The speed is right. You can response to the terrain by adjusting your tension. Interesting changes in scenery. You can feel the rises, the dips and the curves. I would not hesitate to purchase another dvd from this company.",1479168000,,251,4.6
8558664,5,B00AWWGOHE,This was fantastic! Thank you!,1478217600,,30,5.2
8558665,5,B00AWWGOHE,"love the natural sounds, especially from the sheep!  The scenery is very green and lush.  I will purchase more VITA Digital Production DVD's for my treadmill.",1473724800,,158,5.038461538461538
8558666,5,B00AWWGOHE,Nice workout video for an easy ride on my recumbent exercise bicycle. Well done,1461110400,,79,4.714285714285714
