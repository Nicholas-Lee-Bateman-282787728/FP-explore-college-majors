5009266,1,B006OGKTZK,"This video was the worst I have ever seen or tried. This seemed like a home video from her gym and I think the instructor is clinically depressed. Usually workout videos pump you up, the instructors are energetic and smiley... not this poor woman.",1420329600,2,247,4.636363636363637

5009269,2,B006OGKTZK,"I had high hopes for this workout but I was disappointed.  It was so slow that I was having a hard time staying in engaged.  I also didn't think it was that great a workout.  I barely worked up a sweat over the half hour.  If you are interested in this type of workout, I would recommend Xen Strength by Danielle Steele or Kristin McGee's S3 workout.",1393286400,6,350,4.17910447761194
5009270,5,B006OGKTZK,Exactly what I was looking for. Great synergy between yoga and weights... You have to know the poses and feel the balance! Love Kim.,1379030400,2,132,4.541666666666667
5009271,5,B006OGKTZK,"The video combines two aspects in one workout and are both excellent.

I am a dedicated fan of Kimberly Fowler.

5009272,4,B006OGKTZK,"""Yoga + Weights"" is an easy to follow yoga workout with light weights.  Kimberly Fowler, the instructor, uses a pair of 3 pound dumbbells.  Most poses are easy and the lifting is light and the reps are few, with 5 reps per exercise or side.  At the end, while in the final pose, I felt calm and relaxed and I wanted to just stay there for a while in gentle repose.

8501908,1,B006OGKTZK,"I tried this on two different DVD players at home and unless you go through a lengthy Paul Mitchell infomercial, you can't get to the yoga part.  Don't have the patience for that!  Why pay good money for commercials?",1527811200,,216,4.512820512820513
8501909,4,B006OGKTZK,Good and challenging.  Just what I was looking for,1504828800,,50,4.555555555555555
8501910,4,B006OGKTZK,"It's a great work out, you feel results right away, the only things i didn't like it's that there's no music, and i wish it last longer, but still great ",1489881600,2,153,4.1
8501911,5,B006OGKTZK,"After I purchased this i actually got another copy because I did The Flat Belly Challenge at Kimberly's studio in Venice, CA.  Using both the book and DVD and going to studio classes, I lost over 7 pounds in 1 month. I am slowly getting more flexible and will continue to use my DVD for at home mat work. The video is a little slow but this was good because at first I did not know what the heck I was doing.",1487808000,2,408,3.975609756097561
8501912,5,B006OGKTZK,Love this DVD. It just the right length and challeng. A nice addition to my other yoga,1476144000,,86,4.117647058823529
8501913,5,B006OGKTZK,"Challenging and rewarding.  I've been doing this DVD for a few weeks and really enjoy it.  Even with only 3 lb. hand weights, I feel it.  The best thing I can say about it is that I feel a sense of well-being after doing this.  It runs approximately 30 mins., which is perfect for my schedule.  Kimberly Fowler is an inspiration!",1473552000,,329,4.327868852459017

8501915,5,B006OGKTZK,"Kimberly Fowler does a great job of leading you through a yoga workout with weights.  I like how she reminds you to go slow and to remember to engage your core throughout the workout.  Going slow will engage you muscles more so than going quickly.  I always feel refreshed after doing this workout.  Note, she is not a typical yogi - no chanting, no namaste, just yoga poses.  She also has another great DVD to try, The No Ome Zone.",1461196800,2,432,4.35
