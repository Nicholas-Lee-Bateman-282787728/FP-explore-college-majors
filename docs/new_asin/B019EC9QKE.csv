I like Sarah Jessica Parker.  Love romantic comedies.  So, this really should have been beyond easy to keep me happy for a few hours.

BUT.  THIS.  WAS. TERRIBLE.  It was like a punishment.  They couldn't even film Rome to maximize its beauty.  Go watch paint dry.  You be more entertained.",1496793600,,443,4.468354430379747

It is lighthearted yet very touching, sweet and funny. I loved it. I only wish I would have been able to talk my teenaged daughter into watching it with me because there are some really nice mother/daughter/granddaughter/grandmother elements in it, with a nice dose of romance thrown in.

7570710,3,B019EC9QKE,"Cute movie, not much depth.  Some funny moments.  Sarah Jessica Parker is pretty much still Carrie Bradshaw, just with less fashionable though more attractive clothes, and a teenage daughter.  Otherwise, her personality is pretty much the same here.  Not great acting or characterization, and the story is not very believable though it is cute.  The same concept could have been executed much better.  Probably would have given only 2 stars except that I was an avid SATC fan and it was nice to see a bit of Carrie again, albeit not so appropriate as a supposedly different character.",1466208000,,584,4.908163265306122

7570722,4,B019EC9QKE,"We were pleasantly surprised by this movie!  There are actually three love stories, one young, one middle aged, and one old.  The old was actually the most touching, to see a couple who had been out of touch for decades, reunite after many years apart.  The character of the elderly mother, who at first was portrayed as grumpy and losing touch with reality, turns out to be neither, as the movie shows her finding a way to get to Rome to reunite with her lost love.

The rebellious teen daughter who was on a path to destruction and the elderly lady, find commiseration in each others plights, become friends and and help each other plights.  The insight of the older lady and her friendship, helps the teen see the reality of the fellow she thinks shes in love with.

The lead characters, the mother of the rebellious teen and son of the elderly lady, also have a chance to rekindle a lost chance of love lost when they were lovers twenty years and one divorce prior.  All this takes place during a long car pursuit in Italy, when the daughter and elderly mother take off in the sons red Alpha, and are then pursued by the son and teens mother.

Enjoyable enough that I could watch it again, as a pleasant, happy, light-hearted movie filled with a good dose of love and romance.",1464048000,3,1280,4.463519313304721

7570754,2,B019EC9QKE,"I think that this film was badly edited or filmed and is missing a few key scenes.

SPOILER ALERT
There are a few scenes where you get hints that Sarah Jessica Parkers's character and the mother of the male lead played by Raoul Bova had a past. We know that SJP and RB had a relationship in their youth and then SJP left later marrying back in the US and having a daughter. The SJP character at one point says the mother was ""always a bitch"" but there never seems to be a reason and the elderly mother is now on a road trip with SJPs daughter and seems genuine towards the daughter and sweet in trying to meet up to marry her own lost love. Later we learn another young lady in RBs the film was a daughter he had BEFORE his youthful relationship with SJP. Could the mother have been bitchy to SJP more as way to scare SJP away from her son for both their own good and now realizes her mistake (from a knowing eye she does give SJP earlier in the film)? Just one scene where we see a flahsback or it is explained that was the case would have filled in some holes in the film and give the reason for liking the characters. It was as if everyone had a secret as to why the relationship didn't work before but none of the explanations go far enough in the film to make any of the characters likable, instead we think SJP was a whining youth who left because she was scared but with no good reason and calls the mother bitchy for no good reason and the RB character just comes across as having always been a ladies man and you never understand why SJP was the one he let get away. ONE SCENE, just one scene with some extra background could have saved this film. Instead, I sat there waiting for the big ah-ha that would redeem the characters, instead all the ""ah-ha"" moments fell flat.",1459641600,,1780,4.174418604651163

Of course the kid will have none of it and takes off for a plane home with mom and exboyfriend in pursuit.  The guys elderly mom with bratty kid takes off with her, to marry an old flame in Rome.

7570897,1,B019EC9QKE,"I absolutely LOVE Raoul Bova, I really enjoy Sarah Jessica Parker movies, and I'm a sucker for rom-coms and international romances...all things that should have made this movie a 5 star winner for me. This is the first--the FIRST--1 Star review I've ever given a movie, but I simply could find nothing good about it, except the fantastic countryside...which was RUINED by the terrible and repetitive harmonica-lead hillbilly soundtrack. They couldn't find some Italian music?

-There was no chemistry between SJP and RB, so the romance - supposedly a long-lost-love - was completely unbelievable. Like someone else said, did these fabulous actors owe someone a favor????
-The teenage daughter was so cliche it was painful to watch (although the actress was darling)
-The soundtrack was obnoxious and repetitive - in fact, now we hum it as the theme song for any stupid moment in our lives. Seriously, it's like the song that never ends. It's a Small World in a fun house mirror. Terrible.
-SJP hits RB...she HITS him in the face because she's being coy and cutesy. I HATE it when girls/women hit boys/men because they think it's cute. It's not.
-I didn't cry. Not once. Out of the HUNDREDS of movies I've watched in my life, this is the ONLY rom-com I can remember in which I didn't shed a tear. BIG RED FLAG. Ask my kids.

And that's just the first few things off the top of my head.

I'm not kidding, people. I love those two actors on the cover, but that's truly the best part about this movie (See my above comment about the Italian scenery).

Find something else to watch. You'll be glad you did.",1456444800,24,1601,4.686832740213523
7570898,3,B019EC9QKE,"""A woman takes what she wants, when she wants it."" Maggie (Parker) is starting to lose touch with her daughter Summer (Day). In an effort to reconnect they take a trip to Italy. Maggie sees this as a bonding experience but Summer sees it as punishment and is worried about her boyfriend who she left. When Maggie reconnects with a former love it only enforces Summer's desire to return home and she takes a car, and a grandma, and will stop at nothing to fly home. Maggie will stop at nothing to stop her. This is really not that bad of a movie. Generic and formulaic but still worth seeing and I actually enjoyed watching this. The movie is pretty predictable but it is a romantic comedy so that is to be expected. In terms of chick-flicks I have seen worse and while this is nothing super outstanding it was better than I was expecting and I laughed quite a bit. Overall, nothing original or unexpected but still worth your time. Much better than I was expecting. I give this a B.",1456444800,,982,4.4010989010989015

What a spoiled, ungrateful brat, insensitive, self-absorbed, rude, selfish, pig headed jerk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I think the daughter with pink hair-her character was very immature in so many ways and you don't have to act like that at 17, 18. Appreciate your mom taking you to Italy! Don't be so RUDE to everyone around you! She pouted until the last couple minutes of the film. I enjoyed Carmen and the old man.

her daughter and they wrote that daughter to be a selfish jerk!!!",1531785600,,757,4.6

8744910,1,B019EC9QKE,"Might be the most cringeworthy movie ever. I cant emphasize enough how unlikeable SJP & the girl cast as her daughter are as characters. The daughter especially is so incredibly self absorbed & spiteful. Imagine for a moment that you have a 16 year old daughter. Then imagine that she steals a car in a foreign country, taking along an elderly woman shes been told is in poor health and senile. Then imagine that she tries to leave this elderly & (she believes) mentally impaired human being in the middle of nowhere on the side of the road. Because damnit, HER problems are more important than any old woman.
See?
Theres no redeeming her after that. And SJPs character isn't anymore endearing than her daughter. Basically she plays SJP... typically neurotic & demanding of privilege. Between the two of them, this was actually angering to watch.",1528934400,,846,4.801369863013699

8744917,5,B019EC9QKE,"I gave this 5 stars because people missed the many important messages occurring in today's world. When I think about something in a movie that is worthwhile, it deserves some attention.
1. I always love the scenery in Europe
2. The message of HONOR (provided by the 'grandmother'). The young girl, and yes, I have mentored dozens of young women that actually think some guy 'loves' them (or even has the capacity to care about anyone but himself) and that they need to 'prove' it by doing something stupid the guy tells them to, that only benefits this shallow guy. This self-centered brat had NO honor, and that is, unfortunately, not uncommon. She was not honoring herself--a lesson she seriously needed to learn.
3. Yes, kids, ANY rap sheet on you can cause you not to be able to fly internationally, no matter how small. Or at least put you through a lot of hassle! And if suspected of something in a foreign country, even if you are innocent, and you have even a minor rap, beware.
4. Jumping to conclusions, even as silly as something like her believing his daughter was the girlfriend, is an everyday occurrence in any kind of relationship. We jump to conclusions instead of asking the questions.
5. He is a handsome man! But then I adore Italy and have no idea why my son and his family get to live there and I don't! Oh, yes, perhaps being that his wife is Italian could be a part of that :) . If my son had had a rap sheet, no green card for him!",1515369600,2,1456,4.396296296296296
