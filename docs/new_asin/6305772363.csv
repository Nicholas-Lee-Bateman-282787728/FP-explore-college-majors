7894396,5,6305772363,I just simply love this movie! Even when it is kind of old movie I could say it is a classic of the Spain cinematography from the 80's! This DVD is in great condition! I'm pretty happy that I can add it up in my collection!,1475452800,,223,3.869565217391304
7894397,1,6305772363,"This film is patronisingly skewed against men, and is superlatively shallow. It argues that women should be allowed to live by a looser moral code than men, and that women have a right to expect their men to provide for them. That said, most of the charcters in this film are deeply unsympathetic. Watching this film just made me indignant and angry. Even the acting wasn't top notch. If you're intelligent, give this one a miss.",1380067200,,429,4.657894736842105

7894399,5,6305772363,"This is a great little Spanish movie about family, gender, and sexual tension (""Sex relieves tension. Love produces it"") in modern Spain. Carmen Maura plays a nuanced role as a devoted housewife and reporter in love with her sweet and apparently honest but incorrigibly sexist husband.  Great bits include mother-daughter talks, stoned son, Maura and her friends feminist walk out during a dinner scene and the envy of Carmens character (called Carmen, I believe!) envy of the ""elegant men"" that nonetheless drive her crazy. The voice over was put to such good use that I found myself identifying as much with her as her husband Antonio (played by Antonio Resines).",1073347200,7,665,5.045454545454546
7894400,5,6305772363,"This movie, that is actually based on a novel by Carmen Rico Godoy, is the personal view of the life of an independent woman that has to face the fact that in the 90s the world is still ruled by men, just because their men.  Keep in mind that this movie and the novel are set in Spain, a very traditional an chauvinist society.  She is an accomplished woman, as one she is not only a professional journalist, but she is also a housewife and a mother.  Her crisis arises when she realizes that she is a mother figure to her husband, that the gynecologist sees her as a woman and not a patient, and that a promotion at work will go to the best man and not the best person.  When the mistakes of others slip by seamlessly, hers do not--society punishes for being a ""Superwoman""--something that she brought onto herself.  Carmen Maura is excellent.  She sets the tone of the movie--in the novel the character appears to be a neurotic woman, yet Maura manages to give us a woman with a purpose, and why not,with a vengance.",977184000,21,1018,4.35978835978836
7894401,3,6305772363,"This movie, based on an Almudena Grandes novel, is a tribute to women all around. Carmen Maura is the wife of a man that  cheat on her and a son in the process to grow... a tragedy changed her forever. This comedy has great  moments of laugh,  but the book is much better. I think in some levels the  director misunderstood the novel, Almudena Grandes is a feminist  who  believe that women are not better than men, they're even and in this movie  goes in the inverse. Other movies based on an Almudena novel are  ""Cuernos de mujer""  y ""How to be unhappy and enjoy it"".",961027200,16,569,4.2924528301886795
