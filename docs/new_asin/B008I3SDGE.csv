5166893,5,B008I3SDGE,"[My blu-ray review copied to the DVD page]

64-year-old Meat Loaf hits the stage in Sydney (shortly after a disastrous live performance at the AFL final) accompanied by an army of HD cameras filming what he announced to fans would be one of his final trips to perform in Australia/New Zealand. He makes restitution in full for the AFL nightmare.

If It Ain't Broke, Break It
Bat Out of Hell
Peace on Earth

+a 30-minute documentary offering a backstage look at Meat in preparation for taking the stage

The Good:

The video is outstanding; I'd even go so far as to say flawless. It's simultaneously grand and intimate, basked in vivid colours, and tack-sharp HD. The audio mix on the Blu-ray is equally without fault offering dynamics, impact, clarity, and openness. The addition of a violinist and a sax-player to the band adds a great twist to some of the sound. In particular, the sax-player (Dave Luther) is musically astounding; I've always felt that live rock is aided by the presence of a sax and this is absolute proof. Meat's band has for for 30 years been the single best in the entire business and they are note-perfect here for every second of the performance. Some pieces have been changed out from the long-term lineup, most notably Justin Avery is in and Mark Alexander is out. While I loved Alexander, Avery's take on the songs is fresh and captivating - he takes the old and familiar and makes them new and intriguing; he's a jaw-dropping talent. Meat's voice isn't what it once was owing to decades of destructive abuse; however, it gets stronger as the show goes along. Meat himself is a showman without equal in the music industry and he turns in an honest, genuine, heart-felt evening of fun. It was also wonderfully refreshing to have some new songs inserted into a setlist that had remained largely unchanged for several tours. The documentary is a great add-on.

The Bad:

Nothing big really. As mentioned, if you're watching a concert only to hear flawless, prerecorded, Mariah-runs then you're unlikely to be wowed. If, however, you came for a big show by one of the best showman ever, then this shouldn't be a concern. I thought a couple of the tracks were unusual choices and I always wish that Meat would draw in some of his great Bad Attitude tracks as that album has been largely forgotten despite representing one of the best recording outings of his career.

The Verdict:

Essential for any Meat Loaf fan. The best video/audio offering of any Meat concert. The vocals have been better on past concerts, but they in no way leave you feeling let down. The best band that Meat's ever toured with. 5 stars out of 5 without reservations of any sort.",1369440000,6,3038,4.684803001876173

5166895,5,B008I3SDGE,"Even the most avid Meat Loaf fan (guilty) has to admit that his voice is a mere shadow of what it was in his prime.  That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this concert.  The Neverland Express has got to be one of the tightest back up bands in the business.  Patti Russo is still dynamite, and despite what other reviewers have said, is in the entire show.  Meat Loaf is the consummate showman and clearly loves his fan.  My only regret is that as yet, I still haven't gotten a chance to see him in person.  After watching this video, would I pay my hard earned money to see him in person?  In a heartbeat.",1367366400,2,599,4.201754385964913

5166898,3,B008I3SDGE,"I had preordered this DVD at $9.99. On release day it suddenly went ""temporarily out of stock"" and never came back into stock after a few months. It then showed up here on Amazon by a different vendor at a higher price. Even though the item ships via Amazon they said the price was out of their hands so I ordered at the higher price. Once it arrived I watched it. I have been a Meat Loaf fan since the original Bat Out Of Hell many moons ago. I have seen him perform live on four occassions and own most of the other DVD's put out. This one is entertaining but certainly not his best (or worst) DVD. This show comes off kind of lifeless and the new female singers and backup singers aren't as good as the previous ones.",1360713600,3,720,4.15
