I wish that the studio would have made it available in a DVD format though, but just being able to get an old VHS tape was better than nothing. Too many of Hollywoods old and now forgotten moives have been passed by and not transferred to DVD.",1363651200,,406,4.355263157894737
7868649,5,630434211X,"This is a very rare video about the conflict between the Normans and Saxons in the eleventh Century.  A Saxon Nobleman was being forced to marry a Norman, but he instead married a Saxon Noblewoman called Lady Godiva.  Marriages were arranged at that time for the nobility. The constant fighting between the two cultures led to Lady Godiva taking a horseback ride through the streets of Coventry lead by a Nun.  She stated that the Saxons would NOT look upon her naked body.  They did not.  This story is filled with romance, adventure and history from that time period.  It stars the very beautiful Maureen O'Hara, and George Nader.. A wonderful movie, with important pieces of history.  I highly recommend it to people who are interested in stories with kings, queens, ladies, knights, castles and intrigue.",1359244800,3,808,4.897058823529412
7868650,3,630434211X,"Yes, this is meant to be a ""faithful"" historical account of the events leading to Lady Godiva's naked horse-ride through the streets of Coventry, but, strange enough, it seems to more closely resemble a broad comedy remake of Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"".  Maureen O'Hara, the undisputed Queen of Technicolor, rides to glory in the title role of LADY GODIVA OF COVENTRY (1955); with George Nader as her husband, Lord Leofric, the Earl of Mercia.

Betrothed to a Norman noblewoman, Lord Leofric (Nader) decides he'd rather be thrown in jail than get married to her, where he meets the sheriff's lovely sister Godiva (O'Hara).  Beautiful, strong and with a firm social conscience, Godiva soon becomes his wife, yet their union is tested by the machinations of corrupt Count Eustace (Leslie Bradley), who secretly plots to otherthrow the Saxon monarchy with his Norman soldiers.  In a last-ditch bid to prove the loyalty of the Saxons, Godiva rides naked through the Coventry township, her long, flaming-red hair the only thing concealing her modesty...

Maureen O'Hara saves the day with a spirited performance.  Universal loved putting O'Hara in these lush period adventures and she does suit the era of the story incredibly well. George Nader is also solid as Leofric.  Look closely for Clint Eastwood in a small role as the ""First Saxon"".",1257465600,5,1346,5.090909090909091
