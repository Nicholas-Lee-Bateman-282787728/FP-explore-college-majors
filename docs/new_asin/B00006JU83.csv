1782820,1,B00006JU83,"Whats the point of making a movie about a  Megalodon if it is only the size on an average white? I THOUGHT that the filmmakers were ripping of Steve Alten's MEG, but if they had actually READ the book then maybe they would know a thing or Two about Megalodons.. Not so.
It would have been a helluva lot more cool to have an animatronic shark instead of footage, so that it could interact with the actors. Hell, JAWS did it 1975, how hard could it be to create a decent one nowadays?",1041033600,2,482,4.182795698924731

1782843,3,B00006JU83,"But - THE LINE - more then makes up for it!  I have no idea who else was in this movie and honestly I didn't care.  I bought it because I am a HUGE John Barrowman fan!  During a TV interview, John admitted he did the movie because he needed the money.  I think he should have just let the creditors have him.

This is truly a Guilty Pleasure Movie. The CGI completely blows - one scene where the shark eats a man while in a motor boat looks like he was swirled down the shark's throat!  It was also shot in Latvia (I think) but the setting is supposed to be Mexico, so EVERY SINGLE ACTOR'S VOICE IS DUBBED!  Except for John and his two co-stars. The worst being one of the first scenes where the heroine is supposed to be talking to a night watchmen who is white, but speaks with a African-American jive accent.  If this movie had been billed as a comedy, it would have made millions!",1355356800,,884,4.128654970760234
1782844,4,B00006JU83,"So, I know the Oscars are being broadcast about now, but this movie seems right to watch and review over the sanctimonious ceremony in Tinseltown.  I'll be the first to admit, this film is not classy, lacks any sense of quality or artistry, yet it's ridiculous, over the top cheese that tends to be more memorable than anything a group of 60+ year old white man can vote for as ""quality cinema.""

Let's not talk about the acting, which is pretty bad.  Nor the plot or script, which is a direct rip off of Jaws.  No, let's talk about the action, which starts with a 15 foot Megalodon off the coast of Mexico and ends up with a whooping 60 foot monster swallowing people and small boats in a single gulp.

Much to the filmmaker's credit, the sharks are portrayed by stock footage of Great Whites for the most part, with the occasional mechanical head or CGI beast thrown in when needed.  But the opening scenes of the final act, where actors are combined with stock footage of a real shark, are terrific.  It makes the movie worth watching just for that.

Add in the most horrid pick up line ever recorded, a few dismembered limbs and a bit of nudity, and you have the perfect Saturday night flick.  It might not be The Artist, but I think it will stick in your memory longer then this year's Best Picture winner.",1330214400,,1311,4.406639004149378
1782845,4,B00006JU83,"I'm a sucker for Shark movies, I have many faves such as Deep Blue Sea, The Last Shark and even Red Water. This one is definitely up with the big boys. Not much of a plot or good acting just pure fun. Grab some popcorn and watch some great shark attacks and some really awkward lines.",1276905600,,284,4.089285714285714
1782846,5,B00006JU83,Enjoyed this movie espessially the unexpacted appreance of the Megalodon.  Great low budget job.,1250208000,,96,5.857142857142857
1782847,5,B00006JU83,"IMO, the actress Jenny McShane, who plays the anthropologist in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shark-Attack-3-Megalodon/dp/B00006JU83/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shark Attack 3: Megalodon</a>, steals the show! She's not only lovely to look at, she's also a good actress and a woman of action. Her helicopter scenes and boat scenes are totally believable, especially when she's face-to-face with the shark, with the boat falling apart around her. Wow! That was exciting.

I admire her acting ability. The scene where she cries on co-star John Barrowman's shoulder--after the shark almost gets her--might seem like ""overkill"" to some, but to me it's a realistic human reaction. She's strong in facing down the shark, does her own action scenes, and carries her weight throughout the movie. That's what matters.

The plot was exciting, different and had enough twists and turns to keep me horrified and amused. So what if it's a little campy: a boat seeming to stand still while at full throttle, a shark that makes ""bear sounds,"" and other funky little things like that! That's part of the fun with this type of movie and what makes it so unforgettable to true horror buffs.

I understand that McShane acquired a cult following from these Shark movies and that she and Barrowman landed some fine roles after this one.

As for Barrowman, he's a hunk, all right; a little too ""pretty"" for my taste, though. I think he should take a page out of Brad Pitt's book and get a bit scruffy for his next roles. Not to knock him in any way; he's a good actor and has a wonderful singing voice...a voice that has won awards in the UK.

He turns me off in this movie when he says something shocking to McShane that wasn't in the script. To her credit she simply walked away for a while, returning to finish the tasteful love scene a short while later.

McShane is one of the Dream Reachers featured in my latest book, co-authored with Chase Von. When editing Von's interview with this actress, I learned that Barrowman made his ""infamous"" remark as a joke, to break tension among the cast due to long hours on the set. The sad thing is that the editor forgot to remove it before distribution...and the rest is history. Some people love that line, while others, like me, abhor his vulgarity...even as I try to understand his reason.

Nonetheless, I love this movie and have watched it three times already. Wait till you see the size of that ""Momma"" shark. Those scenes will startle you and keep you coming back for more. That's the beauty of ""campy horror.""

McShane also played in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shark-Attack/dp/1573627488/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shark Attack</a>, opposite Casper Van Dien, but couldn't play in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shark-Attack-2/dp/B000055WFV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shark Attack 2</a>&nbsp;due to being in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Watcher/dp/B00003CXND/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Watcher</a>&nbsp;with Keannu Reeves.

However, the main problem is the plastic shark that jumps out of the water and everything seems to fall into it's mouth.

Is this a made for TV movie?? must be, because it clearly has NO BUDGET and the actors didn't even devote their time to personify the characters and roles they played.

just one good thing...... this movies about shark attacks and the body count is big......but seeing people get eatin lookz fake and does not compare to jaws or jurrassic park.

1782852,5,B00006JU83,"what can i say, this is probably my favorite movie of all time. I've bought the movie twice; someone stole the first copy and i wasn't that mad; one because if someone wanted to steal Shark Attack 3 i understand its an amazing movie which will bring many,many laughs and two because you can always get it for under 10 bucks.  Ive seen this movie sooo many times and it still never gets old, it is by far the worst funniest movie ever made.  This movie has me and my friends always on the lookout for movies like this one; right now Mosquito is tops on our list; you should probably check that out.  What else is there really to say, everyone should watch this movie at least once and i bet youl watch it again and again.  I love watching this movie with shark attack virgins; its amazing especially when the ""I'm really wired"" line comes out of absolutely nowhere!! haha its cinematic genius.

We've also come up with a drinking game; here are some of the rules, but you don't have to use them all unless you really want to get drunk.

1. drink for every mexican and american flag
2. drink every time you notice a mistake (ie when you hear the boats engine going but they are obviously just sitting in the water, when you hear the shark growl like a bear, when ben takes a picture of the shark tooth and the WHOLE tooth is on the screen) there is pretty much a mistake every couple minutes or more.
3. drink when you see the Mexican president and our president

I hope this was somewhat helpful but most of all its great seeing that there are other Shark Attack 3 fans out there. If you haven't seen this movie yet i hope this review would help but trust me you will not regret it.",1208908800,4,1681,4.2507836990595615

seriously if u go back to watch this film while plastered watch for the allstar cinematography of david worth

a normal sequence goes as follows:

1. a character says to turn or follow something
2. 4 second shot of the steering wheel of the boat turning
3. a shot of the stern close up going through the water
4. 4 second shot of the accelerator joystick thing being pushed forward.
5. shot of the shark
6. 3 second shot of the steering wheel for no reason

1782855,5,B00006JU83,"This movie is wonderful.  First off, if you don't know the joy of John Barrowman yet, you are in for a treat.  The pure exuberance of his acting, the happiness with which he delivers what has got to be the worst pick up line in the history of the universe, and the fact that he has sexual chemistry with everyone in the movie (EVERYONE), except the girl he's supposed to be hooking up with makes this an instant classic.

I'm waiting for the sequel-- Shark Attack 4: Megalodon 2.  If you are a Torchwood or Doctor Who fan, it is also fun to imagine that Barrowman is actually playing our beloved Capt. Jack Harkness and that the Megalodon has slipped through the rift and Capt. Jack had to go undercover to fix things.  Seriously, some good times.",1200268800,,747,4.423357664233577

1782857,1,B00006JU83,"Since John Barrowman is an openly gay actor in England I knew this movie had to really be bad. Understand that actors are only as good as the material they have to work with and the director directing, so I blame these for how well the movie turned out. We are talking about a bad rip-off of the Jaws movie, with dialog and special effects that obviously were done by very underpaid filmographers. Cheap, cheap, cheap!

The only redeeming value of this movie is the one line that John says to the leading lady after they have worked up a plan to kill the shark. He says, ""I'm really wond up, so how about if I take you home and eat your pussy?"" John dear, that is the worst pickup line I have ever heard and when you are licking her neck in the following shower scene, you are no where near the the object of your characters final goal! A straight actor might have called the writers on this line, but as pretty as you are none of us would have not been charmed into bed with you.

1782858,5,B00006JU83,"Seriously, this is the most enjoyable movie I have ever seen.  This is the movie that B movies think they aspire to be.  Poorly made, poorly acted, poorly written and directed.  It's all there.  Oh yeah, and the visual effects were the worst!  But that's why you love a movie like this, because unlike parodies of B movies, this film actually loves every aspect of film and pays homage to every aspect of the B movie, from the subconscious acting and technical decisions to the highly conscious visual effects work.  It was all done on the fly, for very little money.  You may have noticed I haven't called this movie a B movie, it's because it isn't.  Watch it and you'll see the difference, read between the lines and know these are skilled filmmakers at the top of their game who know how to entertain for every frame of film.  This isn't Slither, this isn't the new Dawn of the Dead.  This is real old school.  This is the most fun I've ever had watching a movie.  I laughed harder at this than any pretentious comedy horror imposter.  Watch this and tell me it doesn't put you in stitches, I dare you. Buy it.

1782860,2,B00006JU83,"Where to start...the acting is horrible, I found myself watching the actor's lips as they spoke, just to see if the audio was dubbed; I don't think it was.  A majority of the mexican actors sounded like and had the emotion level of ""Jose Jalapeno (... on a steeek!)"" from ventriloquist Jeff Dunham.  If you're lost by that analogy, rent Jeff Dunham: Argueing with Myself; if you like stand-up comedy, you won't be disappointed.  As for this movie, the shark scenes were horrible overlays of common shark footage.  I also never knew shark's growled rather like dogs or large cats such as tigers.  I took the time to copy the displayed subtitles and copy the actual wording of the world's greatest pickup line in this movie as well...

subtitles:

girl: I'm exhausted.

guy: Yeah, me too. But I'm really wired. Shall I take you home and eat your p@ssy?

actual:

girl: I'm exhausted.

guy: Yeah, me too.  But, ya know, I'm really wired. What'dya say I take ya home and eat your p@ssy?

Overall the movie isn't that great, but if you can rent it cheap or something; the overall experience is so cheap and pathetic it's worth it to laugh at.",1180310400,2,1137,4.569306930693069

All of the negative reviews for this movie are exactly true, it's class A cheese, the scientific facts are dubious at best, the shark is more laughable than anything scary and the green screen work is pure hilarity.

But come on, you don't watch a movie like this for it's cinematic aspect, you watch it because of how bad it is. I haven't laughed so hard during a movie then when I did in watching this.

""My lawyers will have a field day with you.  THEY are the real sharks.""

""I'm really wired.  So why don't I take you home and eat your _____.""

This is the kind of dialogue you can expect from the film.  These are the highlights.  Of course, I am not pointing out all the excellent grunting and 'roaring"" that the sharks expel, but I don't want to give everything away.

Believe me, This isn't over, not by a longshot.

So get out of here.

P.S. The harbor master is barring any boats from leaving the bay. He fines $5000.

So, FINE PAY IT. You people know how much is riding on this. How much money is standing on this movie RIGHT NOW. It's my future, and yours.

No debate here between 1 star because it's so poorly done and 5 stars because it's so deliciously bad; it's a 5 star movie, no question.  Continuity, quality props, editing, horrible dialogue and scale mean nothing in this movie. No mention of the plot in this review, it's secondary. When you can literally laugh out loud at events because they are so poorly done with total disregard for the viewer, this B-movie is a must see and worth 94 minutes of your life.

The funniest scenes for me are when boats are supposed to be speeding along the shore and then in close ups of the actors, the background is not moving, no wind, no boat vibration, absolutely stationary. And not just once, this methodology is used for every boat scene irregardless of the boat, time of day or actors involved.  You can't miss it. And they keep jamming the main boat into full throttle without ever shifting it into a lower speed position. Look we're in low, jam it into high. Look we're in low again some how, jam it into high. Look we're in low yet again, jam it into high. Over and over again. Quality entertainment, guaranteed.

When the Megalodon first appears and eats a boat whole, it's hysterical.  Gulp, it's over. You're thinking ""What the heck just happened?""  Then two guys in the water: gulp, it's over. A raft full of a dozen people: gulp, it's over. A guy jumps off a boat and swan dives into the Megalodon's wide open mouth; gulp, it's over. A jet ski traveling at high speed: gulp, it's over. All of varying sizes and all barely fitting into the giant sharks mouth. The reuse of stock shark footage over and over again is quite entertaining.

In the final act, the Megalodon is attacking a large yacht and it's panicked passenger are doing what?.... they are jumping INTO the water! What? Why? The boat isn't sinking and there's 75 feet of body chomping carnage IN THE WATER anyway. Talk about people deserving to die.

Despite enormous plot holes, haphazard editing, meaningless scenes, unbelievable characters (""What did he just say?"") and bad acting, this movie just plows on and like the Megalodon, nothing can stop it.  Combined with a gratuitous sex scene and well placed nudity throughout, it's a must see. If you're a B-movie, schlock, sci fi horror junkie, it's a 5 star movie.

Let me warn you all - please don't spend money on this unless you truly do want another so-bad-it's-hilarious B-movie about sharks in your collection. For the rest of us, it's been on the Sci-Fi channel, where I'd definitely recommend catching it as you can always flip to another channel. But the last 30 minutes of this movie were by far the most hilarious so if you want to laugh at something as sick and sad as reality TV, turn it on. As other reviewers have expressed, this an awful, very badly made movie. The script just plain stinks, and the acting was just as bad. Most of the actors deliver their lines apathetically especially when they should be showing concern. The shark keeps changing in size over the course of the movie, all the footage of the shark in action is obviously ripped from documentaries of the real creatures. Plus, aside from the shark changing size the entire time, it's a different shark each time. But I really split my side laughing at the end of it. Someone jumps off the boat right into the shark's mouth, but it looks more like they hired the guys from Monty Python to help create this image for us.

1782894,5,B00006JU83,"Shark Attack 3: Megalodon is perhaps the greatest movie ever filmed!  This cinematic masterpiece pits our hero, Ben Carpenter, played by veteran actor John Barrowman best known as the uncredited extra in the 1987 ""Untouchables"", against the terrifying Megalodon, a prehistoric Great White ancestor that makes Jaws look like a minnow.  Aided by the beautiful and equally talented, Cataline Stone, played by Jennifer McShane, of Silk Stockings fame, they do battle with several rampaging sharks, one of which is bent on swallowing packed life rafts whole.

James Lipton of ""Inside the Actors Studio"" said, ""This is the type of movie that makes one think.  Much like classic films such as: Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, and Clockwork Orange.  Compelling and rich.""  Well ... not exactly.

Most likely filmed during a drunken and drug filled weekend on the beach, Shark Attack 3 is full of plot holes, editing errors and some of the worst acting ever packed onto a DVD.  However, these errors have been meticulously woven together into a semi-coherent film that is gradually reaching cult status ... simply for its campiness and slick one liners.

The movie is of the typical man versus nature genre.  Our hero, Ben Carpenter, a local police officer is partnered with paleontologist Cataline Stone in a life and death struggle with the massive Megalodon which is attracted to communication lines deep in the ocean laid by the Apex Corporation, a sinister and evil company.  Apex withheld evidence that the sharks were attracted to electromagnetic fields generated by their underwater fiber optic cables in order to protect their profits.

During the course of their investigation and struggle against the sharks, many of Carpenter's and Stone's friends are consumed whole in spectacular special effects featuring stock footage of Great White sharks as they attack the hapless victims edited into the scenes.  Ultimately this hap-hazard method of special effects results in serious continuity and scale problems.  At times the shark is large enough to swallow a speed boat whole and at other times it struggles to swallow a jet ski.  Fortunately for us the director and editor aren't concerned about such trivial problems and plow right on.

The movie finally reaches a creshendo as Ben Carpenter uses a Sega Genesis game controller to pilot a mini-sub, strangely with more interior room than most 15 passenger vans, toward the rampaging Megalodon that is feasting on the villainous Apex Corporation cronies above.

The film has generated some memorable quotes.

Carpenter: ""Megalo-who?""
Carpenter: ""I'm really wired, how `bout I take you home and eat your *****.""
Stone: ""Your extinct motherf*cker.""",1139270400,4,2704,5.248837209302326
1782895,1,B00006JU83,"This movie is awesome.  I'm torn between giving it 5 stars or 1 star.  I think I'll go with 1, but still a hearty recommendation.  Terrible modern b-flicks aren't typically my thing, as they lack the charm of 80's stuff, and have lotsa horrific CG effects, rather than delightful practical ones.  'Shark Attack 3: Megalodon', however, manages to get a classic crappy movie feel, and has some of the most hilariously awesome effects ever.  Alright, it starts with there  being some  bad sharks and whatnot, but it's basically just another  shark movie.  Sharks attack people, we don't really get to see what's going on, there's some blood in the water, etc.  Nothing new, but pretty fun.  But, than the ugly chick tells us that the sharks aren't great whites, but baby Megalodons!!! so we eventually meet real grown-up Megalodons and they're huge as hell and swallow everything whole.  The effects for this are truly breathtaking, as they simply take stock footage of great whites and shrink down footage of the victim and then stuff it in the mouth.  (Which results in the shark varying wildly in size, as sometimes she can eat a whole raft easily, other times a lone jet-skier barely fits in at all.)  I dunno what that looks like on paper, but rest assured that it is pretty much the funniest thing ever when you're watching.  Also, there's an evil foreign cable company who KNEW THEY WERE MAKING THE SHARKS COME BUT DID NOTHING!!!!!!!! Bastards!!! Don't worry they get their comeuppance.  Also, at one point the ugly chick stuffs a shotgun in the mouth of one of the baby sharks and pull the trigger, and she yells, 'You're extinct, motherf*cker!!!!!!!!' That was awesome.  Check it out.

1782896,2,B00006JU83,"I had never seen this film before, so imagine my delight on getting it as a birthday gift. First off, everyone is absolutely correct when they say this is a blatant ""Jaws"" rip-off with the primary difference that there is a decent looking girl playing Richard Dreyfuss' role here. There is a bit of ""Jaws 2"" mixed in with the electricity subplot, and (oh, why not?) a smattering of ""Titanic"" thrown in for good measure. This film is all over the place, and features some of the absolute worst acting I have ever seen (and I have seen every single Ed Wood film ever made). The acting combined with the ludicrous script and utterly hysterical special effects conspire to doom this effort to utter failure. I really had no idea what rating to give this film: when measured for thoughtful, skilled filmmaking it completely fails to register, when measured for utterly wretched camp it scores infinity, so I settled on two stars.

The plot concerns a resort in Mexico (with a total absence of Mexicans) terrorized by both a huge (75 foot long) computer-generated shark, and an evil electric industry tycoon. There are pointless and futile subplots about everything from submarines to pot smoking electric company employees involved in capitalism run amok. (Don't ask.)

I have several favorite scenes in the film, most of which fail to further the plot one iota. I love the church scene that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie; I was very fond of the ridiculous Apex control room set that looks more like a bunker occupied by the Strategic Air Command during the height of the cold war; I absolutely could not believe the absolutely worst pick up line in movie history (I actually had to rewind the film to make sure I heard it correctly...you will definitely know the line I am referring to when it arrives); but most of all I loved the shark versus boat scenes. Specifically, I could not stop laughing when the shark swallowed a speedboat whole, later repeating the trick with a raft and a jet ski ridden by the evil electric company magnate. There is a rhetorical question left unresolved by the film, but perhaps repeated viewings can clarify: if you are in a large, seaworthy ship being attacked by a shark, why would you jump into the sea? It seems more likely that the shark is actually in the ocean to me, but I'm not a marine biologist, so please do not confuse my observation with professional counsel. A further tip: most experienced submariners do not recommend launching a torpedo at your own submarine when it is caught in the manacles of a shark the size of a locomotive.

This movie really is a thing of wonder. But above all it makes me wonder two things: how, exactly do you get your very own navy surplus torpedo, and who, exactly, was touching that girl's knee at the restaurant? This movie is good for a laugh, but no scares. Watch it with another B-movie fan, and be prepared to groan.",1134604800,3,2923,4.638996138996139

And I tell you I was not dissapointed.  We tend to think of B movies being from the 80's on back, but apparently there is still a small market for straight to video releases.  I will admit:  it's rare to see any B-movie this entertaining.

In short, it's basically a straight-up Jaws rip-off with Russian actors badly dubbed with bad dialogue.  Bad script, bad directing, bad acting, bad key-gripping, bad best-boying, and I'm sure bad-catering all come into play here. But they don't compare to the caliber of the special fx:  no mechanical sharks, no man in shark suits with zippers up the back, it's even worse...Discovery Channel Shark Week stock footage of sharks, super-imposed by what appears to be an 8th grade computers class kid eating people.  Jacques Cousteau is rolling in his grave.

Things to watch for:

-The changing size of the shark

-The medical kit that only has a flare gun in it

-The submarine exterior vs. the size of it's interior

-The man (who looks mysteriously like John McCain) flipping off the shark

-The Apex Corporation's Cold-Waresque control room

-The box of explosives

-The rifle that still works after being underwater for 5 minutes

-""Mistery Shark""

-The digital photo of the shark tooth

-People jumping off the ship that isn't actually sinking

-The fact that there seems to be no Mexicans in Mexico

-Who is touching the girl's thigh?

-The bombs that look like Magic 8-Balls

-""Always carry a spare.  It's the Navy way.""

-The leftover torpedo arsenal in John McCain's house

-The church scene that has absolutley nothing to do with anything else in the movie

-Topless women that have absolutely nothing to do with the movie

-Sex scene that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie

-The man taking off the clown mask that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie

-The skinny dipping scene, where the guy says something incredibly dirty to the girl

-***MY PERSONAL FAVORITE*** ....The line.  Believe me, you'll know it when you hear it.  It's so dirty...I don't think I've ever heard anything that dirty said in a porno even.

Amazingly, it's a highly watchable movie.  There are a few times when the action gets slow, but it generally moves along at a pretty good clip.  All the goofs and badness of it make it a great movie to watch with a friend who appreciates B-movies.  I'm convinced the two leading actors didn't take this movie too seriously due to what appears to be laughter in some serious scenes, but all the other actors are Russian, and this is probably how they feed their vodka habit.

1782905,5,B00006JU83,"***Spoilers! But the movie is so predictable it doesn't matter***

I can't even begin to think where I should start ripping this Horror(able) movie apart.  But let me try.

The Story:  Not much of one but let me try.  Ben is an overly happy chap who seems to be way-too-chummy with everyone on his beach resort... Until the Meg shows up.  This computer animated shark that growls reeks havoc in Mexico and destroys an evil businessman's plans of a fibor-obtic communications cable.  The shark is drawn out of the water by electrodes coming from the cable.  It then goes on a killing spree and has to be stopped by the above mentioned jovial fellow, an attractive paleontologist, and another cheerful individual who happens to have an onslaught of atomic weapons (as all ex-naval officers do.)  They devise a plan to kill the Meg and save the world from a possible prehistoric Armageddon.  I'm serious, this is no joke.

The Bad:  So it begins- I can honestly tell you there is at least one thing to laugh at in EVERY scene.  I'll give a brief listing of them.

-The server who gives the happy Ben coffee in the morning (which Ben seems ready to burst with laughter over this colossal feat) is a different server when the camera changes angles.

-Three and a half words: ""Here comes El Guapo""

-The security guard at the overly hot Cat's museum CAN'T SPEAK.  He is a stuttery mm-mmm-mess

-When Esai starts the boat, they flip back to the jubilant Ben and if you look at the water, the  boat isn't moving.

-The ENTIRE swordfish scene.  Listen to the franco in the background attempting to speak.  Then the whole ""thirty years"" comment. What in the sam hell is that?

-The randomness of the two punk rockers going down a water slide.  Who are they?  Why are they there?  Why is the water in the slide turned on at 2:00 AM?  Who is the mysterious shark queen they show at the end of the scene?  Does she summon the sharks?  Is she in charge of the entire Meg population?  Will she start a chain of events that will lead to the end of the world?

-The line.  You know which one.  Right before the love scene.  ""You know I'm really tired, well actually I'm wired, how bout I take you home and""  -I will NOT ruin this for you.  Watch this with friends you'll get a kick.  I'd try this line at the bars, but I think I'd get my @$$ kicked.

-The code monkeys

-The growls from the shark

-The @$$ man conversation

-The screen on the tracking device is a piece of paper that is glued on.

-The Jet Ski scene

-The way the one dude falls out of the boat during the parasailing scene.

-The fact that the always pleasant Ben and crew find it more necessary to help some drunk with a boo-boo on his head that a lady who is about to get mauled by a megalodon (that growls.)

-The angle on the camera that was put on the meg is on the wrong fin when they show it.

-The intolerable chumminess and amount of high fives.

The Good:  Ha, that's a laugh, Except for the hot girls throughout the entire flick.

For those of you have seen this trash before go back and watch for these flaws.

And for those of you who say this is the worst/funniest movie ever, shame on you!!! You've obviously never seen Satan's Children starring Bobby Douglas.  Check it out.",1106265600,23,3242,4.364705882352941
1782906,1,B00006JU83,"It was one of those Sunday afternoons spent in bed channel-surfing.  I came across a movie where some folks were on the ocean in a boat.  I took the bait and watched.  Within ten minutes, I was queerly entranced.  Was I finally watching the worst film ever made?  After seeing Phantasm in the early 80s, I thought they'd never come up with a combination of worse dialogue, actors, or plot.  Frankly, the effects in Phantasm are better!

The actors are dreadful, but not even Brando himself could have pulled off some of the stupid ""one-liners"" in this film, my favorite of them being when the lead ""dude"" was out on the ocean with the resident wise-cracking-""scientist""-soon-to-be-evening's-conquest/whore, and he spots the Megalodon, shouts at it and says, ""You oversized fish!""  Wow.  I'd certainly feel threatened, especially if I were 70 feet long and weighed 10,000 pounds.  I have to say, though, that I loved the part when the shark bursts through the surface of the water and swallows the boat!  The effects are so bad, they're virtually stunning.  I couldn't tear myself away from it.  All of the deserving jerks in this film bite the big one -- except the ones responsible for its production, and they deserve it the most of all!  By far, though, the most entertaining aspect of this film was the English dubbing over English!  I'm sure this was done to one character in particular so that we'd all be fooled into thinking he wasn't really 60 and really leathery-looking, but that he was really a 22 year old surfer dude from Zuma Beach!  Wow, they had me going!  You gotta see it -- it was so bad, I couldn't tear myself away!  Now, that's entertainment!",1103328000,5,1665,4.70242214532872

This is primo bad movie material here, folks, harkening back to the grand ole' exploitation shark flicks of the 70's and 80's.  Move over GREAT WHITE, move over TINTORERA, move over MAKO JAWS OF DEATH!  There's a new kid on the block!

MEGOLODON is not the usual dull-as-dirt DTV crap that fills up Blockbuster's shelves every month.  This one is unbelievably awful, over-the-top, and absolutely absurd from start to finish.  A giant prehistoric shark is terrorizing a Mexican resort and chomping down on every living human it can get its jaws around.  You know you're in for a good time when the smartest character in the whole film is a dog that refuses to go into the ocean and lets the shark eat its master instead!  Hilarious dialog, awful acting (with bad dubbing), stock footage that stands out like a sore-thumb, graphic gory violence, and even some nudity to keep things a bit sleazy - it's all here and done with so much gusto that you can't help but have a good time even though you know all along how truly terrible it is.  I'm telling you, you have not lived until you've witnessed the shots of a giant shark head spouting from the water and swallowing boats whole.  And when's the last time you heard a lead character tell his new girlfriend something like ""You know, I'm really wired...what do you say I take you home and eat your ******.""  OMG!!!  Unbelievable madness!!!  Joy joy joy!

If you wanna see one of the all-time worst and re-live that old feeling of watching some bad euro-import from the late 70's, this one delivers the dumbness in big doses.

For those who have seen and acknowledged the awesomeness of this film, here are some things to look for when watching it a second time (another thing I highly recommend).
1. When Ben comes out of the water after finding the shark tooth, he mentions to the other divers that he was getting himself dinner, and holds up a mesh bag.  This bag is apparently supposed to contain a lobster, but its contents more closely resemble the thing that jumps out of the egg in Alien.
2. When Ben is taking a picture of the shark tooth and uploading it to his computer with his digital camera, a perceptive observer will notice that the camera is not, in technical terms, ""attached"" to the computer during any part of the process.
3. When Cat is looking at the message Ben posted, the word ""mystery"" has somehow changed its spelling to ""mistery""
4. For those who don't know what fiberoptic cable is, I should explain that it is more or less a bunch of long strands of glass that you shine light through.  I'm no expert, but I can't imagine a fiber-optic cable creating the ""low level electric fields"" that supposedly lure the sharks out of the trench.
5. When the John McCain-looking character shows the tracking device he's going to attach to the shark, it looks suspiciously like a common kind of garage door opener.
6. When the yacht is attacked at the end, you can pretty clearly see the actors knocking furniture over to help simulate a violent striking of the boat by a monster shark.
7. The end credits, after the first three people, read more like a copy of the Russian census.  I'd estimate that about 85-90% of the last names end in the letter 'v'.",1087862400,6,1862,4.5

The baby is  about  15 feet long.  The adult mother is huge 80 feet long.  That  about 2.5 times as long  as the adult Shark in Jaws three.  Good  film like the other to  shark attacks.  Ending is not a dramtic as it was in the second one.

So as far as 'fish eating people' movies are concerned,this had a fresh and original twist, so I really wanted to see where will the  director go with this idea..and the problem is,he did not go anywhere..
This is yet another cheap imitation of the best movie of its genre 'Jaws', lame acting, directing, dialogue and script, the best performance given by the fish!
If the Megalodon ever misses some action and makes a comeback then the word avoid the waters will not be taken lightly, however the Megalodon did comeback in this movie, and still the word avoid is totally relevant.",1064620800,,1041,4.751381215469613

First of all, I had a bad feeling about the title.  And my instinct served me well.  I only lasted less than 10 minutes watching this low-budget, low-theme movie sitting in front of my 32 inch tube.  I pressed ""stop"" button and decided to demand my money back.  I did get my money back.
So, I`` wouldn't recommend anyone ""intentionally"" buy or rent this movie.  I want to give NO STAR rating, but it only gives me 1 star as the lowest.`",1061510400,,626,4.158333333333333
1782940,1,B00006JU83,"I am in my early thirties, which, by almost anyone's definition still classifies me as relatively young. I am old enough, however, that I have watched more than my fair share of grade Z ubercheesy movies. During my late night television excursions in the 1980s, I vividly remember watching the sort of films that could cause serious brain damage to even the most stalwart soul, films loaded with monosyllabic actors, scripts written on clay tablets, and special effects that were neither special nor effective. I thought I saw it all during those halcyon days of youth, until I discovered the wonders of ""Shark Attack 3: Megalodon."" You have not lived until you witness the spectacular beauty, the overwhelming sense of metaphysical ecstasy, the sheer jaw dropping brilliance of ""Shark Attack 3."" In fact, don't even finish reading this review. You are wasting valuable time better spent tracking down a copy of this inspiring objet d'art. Believe me when I tell you that this film will not stay on store shelves for long. I felt from the beginning that I was in the presence of greatness with this movie, and every minute that went by only confirmed this initial impression.
The story of ""Shark Attack 3: Megalodon"" is deceptively simple, but even a doctor of philosophy probably could not discern the higher planes of thought contained in this movie. A resort in Mexico faces danger from the reemergence of the prehistoric Megalodon shark, who swims up from the Challenger Trench to attack an underground cable set up by the evil Apex Corporation. The only hope for humanity rests with the actions of Ben, an employee of the resort, and Cat, a paleontologist who arrives in Mexico to hunt down the shark. The film is necessarily gory, as the shark attacks anyone in the water and even attacks boats with seeming indifference. Just when we think the shark's defeat is imminent, a surprise visitor shows up to wreak further havoc on the human race.
See, it sounds simple, doesn't it? I will admit my credentials leave me woefully inadequate to properly analyze ""Shark Attack 3,"" but I firmly believe the answer lies in the Challenger Trench where the Megalodon lives. The trench is obviously a metaphor for a Nietzschean abyss, and when man stares deeply into the crevasse the abyss stares back by disgorging the prehistoric shark. Ben represents the superman, as you will see when this seemingly mild mannered individual rises over all other humans on the planet to combat the ancient evil of the Megalodon. Ben accomplishes feats no other person could hope to achieve. The boats he sails on move even when they look like they are standing still, and a ship with the hull in tatters from an assault by the shark fails to sink when Ben appears on the scene. Only a superman will lead the human race, and Ben is that superman. If you think Crispin Glover is the end all be all of the performing arts, you will appreciate the genius of John Barrowman, the actor who plays the Ben role. Both actors share the sublime visions that make a film like ""Shark Attack 3"" possible even though Glover unfortunately never appears in the movie.
I quickly realized you don't need to worry about watching the two previous films that constitute the rest of this series. Oh no, ""Shark Attack 3: Megalodon"" stands alone, proudly eschewing such banalities as an engaging script, decent special effects, talented actors, and lush cinematography. The director, crew, and cast of ""Shark Attack 3"" roared their derision at the mere idea of such conventional cinematic structures. These brave pioneers, these trailblazers of the celluloid frontier used stock footage of divers and sharks for half of the total running time of the film. Sure, the actors laughed for no reason during many of the scenes, but you would not contain your glee either if you starred in this straight to video magnum opus. I also noticed how many times the male actors gave each other high fives during the course of the story, which makes perfect sense when you realize that these Shakespearean thespians are merely expressing the elation they feel about such career making roles. This cast is going places, folks. After delivering groundbreaking performances in this movie, they will take the world of industrial training films by storm. Special mention goes to the two gentlemen driving the boat with the parasailer in tow. The performance these two budding Brandos turn in evokes hints of a higher evolutionary form of mankind, a state the rest of us may reach in 10,000 years or so. It should go without saying that I have neither the ability nor the space to convey the full implications of the old tar that accompanies Ben on his quest to defeat the abyss-creature. Just watch for the line, ""I have a spare. It's the Navy way,"" and you'll understand my dilemma.
I suspect plans are underway to recruit additional Slavic actors in order to create a ""Shark Attack 4,"" and I seriously believe that another film in this series will sweep away the old epistemologies and usher in a superior consciousness amongst the human race. In the meantime, we all have our hands full just trying to decipher the intricacies of ""Shark Attack 3."" I give this wonderfully vibrant cinematic venture one star, but not for obvious reasons. The one star is actually a judgment about me, a viewer who failed to grasp the inner configurations of this fascinating philosophical jaunt.",1057449600,65,5416,4.856216216216216
1782941,2,B00006JU83,"Imagine ""Jaws.""  Now take away 99/100 of the budget, all the actors, substitute the mechanized shark with footage, the script and dialogue are by a guy whose only other credit is a published letter to ""Dear Abby"" and voil&agrave;!  You have ""Shark Attack 3-Megalodon""
A giant shark that makes the Big White look like a minnow threatens a Mexican resort.  The evil resort owner does not want to hurt business. Brave security policeman, nubile idealistic girl and old salt want to warn the tourists and get the shark.  Does this sound familiar? A few more keywords: shark attacks boat, shark blows up, someone supposed to have been eaten by the shark shows up alive and well.  All rejoice.
I couldn't decide whether to give this one star because it is so bad or five stars because it is so perfectly bad. I compromised with two.  I won't fault the actors because with dialogue this awful, Sir John Gielgud couldn't have made it sound good.  Director David Worth can't be all bad, he directed the highly successful ""Naked Gun.""  Maybe the budget and a probable 5-day shooting schedule did him in.  So who's to blame?  Let's not blame anyone and instead, cherish it for its purity of bad.  It's kinda fun to recite the actors' lines before they say them,

1782942,2,B00006JU83,"I just finished watching this movie on t.v. and I have to say I am disappointed. I love shark movies but this was just [bad]. I would not recomend that anyone purchase this movie-I wouldn't even pay to rent it. Wait till it comes on t.v.-You probably won't want to watch it again. I like watching shark movies for the shark-This ""giant"" shark was a normal sized shark they tried(and failed)to make look bigger. I can't count the number of times I laughed at the cheesy dialog.

1782943,4,B00006JU83,"This is the third movie in the thematic Shark Attack series, unrelated movies involving sharks in some way.
The prehistoric ancestors of great white sharks have been lured from the deep trenches where they have survived for millennia. At a Mexican resort, a water patrolman finds a shark tooth on a dive. He tries to figure what type of shark it is from but cannot find a similar tooth on the Web. He then posts a query with a phot of the tooth.
Well, the tooth belongs to a megalodon, the ancestor of the great white, which can reach lengths of 70 feet or more. A paleontologist sees the post and travels to Mexico to prove some of her theories, but she keeps the nature of the shark a secret from the locals.
But soon there are some attacks and it becomes known that the shark is there. It is a 15-foot baby. It seems to be attracted by an underwater fiber-optic cable that has a major junction just off the coast.
Our heroes set of to catch or kill the shark. It looks like they are successful when suddenly an adult shows up in a dramatic scene.
Now the hunt really begins. We have paleontologists, divers, hotel owners and communications conglomerates all coming together for the final quarter of the film.
No one built a 70-foot robot shark for this movie. Instead, creative use of camera angles gives a sense of massiveness to the shark footage. Very well done with a relatively small budget, but without the small-budget feel.
This movie seems to be a retelling of the book Extinct by Charles Wilson, but I could find no mention of it.
If you like shark movies, then you will probably like this one.",1053648000,2,1607,4.469387755102041

We had a great time making fun of this movie.  The shark first bellows like a cow and then it evolves into a lions roar.  We were expecting it to bark later but no such luck.  The characters are all awful and the acting is even worse.  The lead character looked more orgasmic while trying to drive the submersible than when he was during his sex scene.  There is just so much to make fun of that we would make outrageous predictions and half of them came to fruition.  I am considering buying this to entertain future guests.",1052092800,5,671,4.2362204724409445
1782945,1,B00006JU83,"The cinematic ""shark"" genre took a massive hit with the third ""Shark Attack"" installment that is, to be blunt, horrible, horrible slop.  This watered down ""Jaws"" ripoff is merely an attempt to lure horror fans into a genre that was resuscitated by ""Deep Blue Sea"", but has had nothing mentionable since.  The first ""Shark Attack"" was not bad, and part II was adequate for a sequel, but ""Shark Attack 3: Megalodon"" does not even follow up the previous pair.  If any of you zombies like to read, this author suggests ""Meg"" by Steve Alten. (which has a terrific follow-up and a third installment in the works)The Megalodon shark was unheard of in literature or motion pictures before Alten's publication, and Disney dropped the ball by purchasing the movie rights and never making it.  Bad move, Disney, because ""Meg"" would have been very fresh if it was made before the atrocious ""S.A. III"" or ""Shark Hunter"", which wasn't as bad. Once again, don't waste your time with ""S.A. III"", for it is forgettable tripe.",1050105600,,1008,4.809248554913295
