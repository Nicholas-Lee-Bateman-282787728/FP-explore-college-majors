971230,4,6305074771,I used this with my 7th graders and they enjoyed the similarities to the book.,1215561600,,78,4.266666666666667
971231,5,6305074771,"Based on Ellen Raskin's great J mystery ""The Westing Game"" the film ""Get a Clue"" is faithful to the story ( with the exception of a few missing characters that doesn't really affect the plot). The story- required reading for many middle schoolers- is a neat puzzle and the actress who plays Turtle is very good- as is the rest of the cast. After viewing the dvd I donated to our library (whose much-loaned video copy had to be withdrawn awhile ago!)",1189641600,,449,4.487804878048781
971232,2,6305074771,"This movie is not at all as good as The Westing Game.  I bought it for my Reading Class to compare the novel to the movie.  All my eighth graders hated it, and I wasn't too keen on it.  Simple little things were changed for no good reason and without very good explanation:  Why would Angela marry Plum?  And therefore, why would he have anything to do with the Westing case?  Connections were made that were never explained, and thus the kids ended up more confused than anything.  As a movie alone, perhaps it would be okay, but I'm not too keen on this being compared at all to a great novel like The Westing Game.",1172361600,2,617,4.267241379310345
971233,4,6305074771,"Great kids movie! Not exactly like the book, but it is lots of fun to read the book first and then note the differences one finds in the movie. This is a movie that will be enjoyed by all who take the time to watch it. It is about a family who moves to a new neighborhood...right next to a haunted mansion. I'll let you watch it to find out the rest.",1129680000,,350,3.875
971234,1,6305074771,Just for clarification purposes: THIS IS NOT THE 2002 DISNEY CHANNEL ORGINIAL MOVIE WITH LINDSAY LOHAN!!,1106352000,7,104,5.5625
971235,1,6305074771,"There is a lot of confusion online between this movie (based on the book The Westing Game) and the 2002 Disney Channel original movie Get a Clue which stars a young Lindsay Lohan. It doesn't help that the Amazon listing is incorrect. The Disney/Lindsay Lohan movie was directed by Maggie Greenwald and was aired on the Disney Channel in 2002, but that is not the movie on this page. The poster for *this* version of Get a Clue (aka The Westing Game) is used often beside the description for the Linsday Lohan movie and is very misleading.

This version of Get a Clue (also known as The Westing Game) is from Showtime & Hallmark Entertainment. It was made for TV in 1997 and directed by Terence H. Winkless. The young girl in this version is played by Ashley Peldon, and in this version you will also find Ray Walston, Diane Ladd, Shane West. (With a little effort, all of this information can be found on IMDB.com)

The Disney Linsday Lohan movie has not as yet been released to video (as of 2004). Even though Amazon lists this movie with other Linsday Lohan movies, it is NOT the Disney/Lohan movie. Disney has not (at this time) released a date for the release of their Get a Clue movie.",1092009600,7,1190,4.47926267281106
971236,5,6305074771,"What a great movie! I must say, those two skateboarders in the transition scene with Ashley riding her bike through the park were fantastic. Very realistic. It's really something when models such as them can do more than just look pretty. And their skateboarding skills are top notch. I highly recommend this film. Go see it!",1046217600,4,325,4.821428571428571
971330,5,6305074771,Use this to end the unit for The Westing Game. My students loved it even though is is different from the book. A great opportunity to compare and contrast and use as a writing prompt.,1436227200,,183,4.257142857142857
971331,4,6305074771,"Very different from the book but it is a great resource for compare and contrasting story lines, plot, and characters.",1435190400,,118,4.95
971332,5,6305074771,Used this to teach my mystery unit for 8th graders!  It's a great resource.,1422748800,,75,4.357142857142857
971333,4,6305074771,"It is the movie companion to the book ""The Westing Game"". It differs from the book and can be used as a stand alone or as a contrast after reading the book. Most students love the book, but not the movie.",1412812800,2,204,4.0
971334,3,6305074771,I have read The Westing Game with my students for 10 years now and they are so excited to hear there is a movie based on it. I always warn them that this particular movie does not live up to the standard of the complicated plot in the book. The characters are even mixed up and some are even more minor than in the book. I wish someone would release a movie that fit closer to the original. Writing a comparison essay is difficult with this movie due to so many differences.,1401321600,4,474,4.163043478260869
971335,2,6305074771,"Well, the movie played, but the sound was not good at all.  I was looking forward to watching it but it wasn't quite the experience I expected because I could hardly hear anything :-(",1398297600,,183,4.382352941176471
971336,3,6305074771,Tis story was loosely based on the Westing Game. I felt that the changes they made to some of the characters and relationships were unnecessary.,1373414400,2,144,4.8
971337,3,6305074771,it was a low budget film of a great classic book it was good for children  to share with some day,1367798400,,97,3.619047619047619
971338,3,6305074771,"I bought this to show my students after we tested on the novel ""The Westing Game."" It was cute. It didn't really do the novel justice, but the novel is kind of complex. The novel is for young adults 13 on up. The movie is for ages 8 to 12. As a stand alone movie I would give it 4 stars. As a movie based on the novel I give it 3 stars. There are no 1/2 stars, so I stuck with 3.",1367366400,,379,3.5783132530120483
971339,1,6305074771,"My son has to read the Westing Game in school. We bought this movie to help him understand what is going on in the story. The book is packed with details that make the plot drag and the story line is hard to follow. This movie changed the partners, events, locations, and eliminated/combined some of the characters, so it is useless for helping with the details of the book. The acting is so bad that we shut it off after 30 minutes.",1336608000,3,433,4.2926829268292686
7883566,5,6305074771,"Very close to book THE WESTING GAME.
Kids loved this!",1523232000,,53,4.4
7883567,5,6305074771,"While this was not exactly like the book; less characters and partners changed a bit, we enjoyed the movie. We thought the overall story was the same. It would also be difficult to make a movie with so many main characters. We would recommend!",1518220800,,243,4.545454545454546
7883568,5,6305074771,"Cute movie!  It is similar to the book, The Westing Game.  My class really enjoyed it!",1500076800,,86,4.3125
7883569,1,6305074771,"First of all, I was dumb enough to pay $30 for a DVD, but then it was in terrible quality.  It froze so bad that I could not finish showing it to my students!  So upset!",1492732800,,169,3.6666666666666665
7883570,2,6305074771,Fun enough story but it isn't like the book.,1483401600,,44,4.0
7883571,4,6305074771,"Very interesting movie! After reading The Westing Game novel (which the movie is based on) with my 6th graders, we watched this movie. Comparing and contrasting the two facilitated great discussions!",1479686400,,199,5.451612903225806
7883572,3,6305074771,It is LOOSLY based on the Westing Game. I am disappointed with the differences with the book and the movie.,1469664000,,107,4.4
7883573,5,6305074771,Exactly as described!,1464307200,,21,6.333333333333333
7883574,5,6305074771,"The dvd came quickly and was good quality. The movie is great, only because we love the book and it's the only movie based on the book we could find. The kids thought it was a little cheesy and dated, which it is, but I loved it!",1445040000,2,229,3.893617021276596
7883575,1,6305074771,"This movie IS  ""The Westing Game"" movie. EXACT!  It's just packed with a different cd case jacket from another movie producer. What a JOKE! Look at the backside of the case and read/view.",1441238400,,187,4.636363636363637
