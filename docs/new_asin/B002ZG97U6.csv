4033189,4,B002ZG97U6,"GROWN UPS

I am a huge Kevin James fan and have not missed one of his films at the theaters, so of course I had to go see this film. Add in that I am a huge David Spade, Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, and Rob Schneider fan and I just can't have a bad time at this movie. Now I will say from the get go this film is not for everybody and I have noticed that some people just don't get this film. This film is basically what the title says, growing up, and well finding your self again as well. This film was not meant as one of Sandler's usual over the top comedies and it is not one of is more serious films either, this film is some where in between. It also helps if you can identify with the characters in this, and it also helps that there is a scene in which Salma Hayek rivals her snake dance scene in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" for her sexiest look ever.

The film is about five childhood friends who are reunited after their school basketball coach passes away. It is here that they decide to spend the weekend together and reconnect with the families that are driving them crazy. Here is the thing about this film it is really not only about the grown ups finding themselves again but about their kids becoming kids. If you get these going in you will have a good time with this flick, I also love that the friends spend the whole time shooting one liners at each other and making fun of each other. Sure it sounds mean but that is exactly what me and my friends do so I could identify with the characters. Now this is all in good fun trying to one up the other and is absolutely a real thing that real friends do, well at least with guys not sure about that ladies. But I will say that my girl joins in with us so I can say some of the women out there do this at least.

Written by Adam Sandler and Fred Wolf and directed by Dennis Dugan you know what kind of film you are in for. But it is with the script and the direction that things do go wrong a bit. The script is lacking a little if you are looking for an over the top laugh a minute comedy, but if you are looking for a more realistic one this is for you. The one thing that is not up for debate is the performances, they are top notch here. I'll start with my boy Kevin James and once again he is perfect here. He plays a family man that seems to be living a great life but has a wife that still breast feeds his 4 year old son. David Spade much like is role on the Happy Madison produced TV series ""Rules of Engagement"" is the loner playboy type still looking for women all the time.

Chris Rock plays a stay at home dad who is underappreciated much like any stay at home parent, never understood that in this society. Rearing kids and taking care of basically everyone of the family member's lives as well as the house is the most important job. Don't get me wrong whoever is the person in the family out there working to pay the bills and feed the fam is just as important, and well that is what Rock's part of the film is saying. Both jobs are vital in the family, don't know why that turned into a rant. Rob Schneider did a great job here as well as the Earthy, one with nature type who happens to love older women, much older women. Of course Adam Sandler plays the big shot Hollywood guy with a fashion designer wife, so of course they are living very well. Also one of the greatest actors ever Steve Buscemi is here in this flick along side Colin Quinn and Tim Meadows as some jealous jerks from the boy's past.

Now while the boys have been promoted as center stage in this film the ladies play just as big a role in this film and do so wonderfully. Joyce Van Patten, Maya Rudolph, Maria Bello, the hilarious Ebony Jo-Ann and of course the always super hot Salma Hayek. They are all excellent in this film as the wives and in Ebony's case mother in law of the guys, all do an excellent job. But I can't help but tell you that at one point in this film Salma Hayek is in a cheerleader outfit with pig tails and well just looking like every boys fantasy. This scene rivals her snake dance scene in the excellent ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" has just plain great to watch, I need a drink of water.

Well now that we have that out of the way I must say that I had a great time watching this movie. I took my girl and her Nieces and nephew to see this flick for part of her Birthday week, my Bro came as well. And yes I said her Birthday week, I decided I would do something special for her each day out of the week for her. Any way maybe all of them adding to the atmosphere mixed with I am a fan of all of these guys and well mixed with Salma Hayek looking so, well any way I enjoyed it. Where is that drink of water?",1278979200,2,4675,4.032327586206897
4033190,3,B002ZG97U6,"I found this movie to be laugh out loud funny, but the storyline, plot, and acting were all filled with several holes.  I almost feel like I could hit copy/paste when reviewing some of the recent comedic theatrical releases.  There just wasn't any depth here, but it doesn't mean I didn't enjoy several of the slapstick jokes being played out.  If you like the old ""Three Stooges"" you will most likely enjoy this film.  Not that I would compare this mediocre release to a classic, but the head slapping was all too familiar.

Adam Sandler is a big time Hollywood agent who has lost any form of connection with his kids.  They sit around all day playing play station while ordering their nanny around.  Not that I condone physical violence, but if I were the nanny and a kid complained about the specific type of chocolate I used in his drink, I might drag him out to the front yard by his ear and do a little ping pong on his back side.  Dude, if you want to wonder why your kids are abusing the nanny, then you might want to stop teaching them how to text her instructions/orders.  First step, stop doing it yourself.

Adam Sandler, David Spade, Kevin James, Chris Rock and Rob Schneider were the starting five of the only championship team ever to be coached in their small hometown.  Sadly, the coach has died and everyone is heading home to the funereal.  We all have had those moments/influences in our childhood and ""the coach"" was impactful on these five boys and their future lives.  So they all head home with their families in tow, and the rumpus re-living of long lost youth begins.

For me this is where the story could have gone two directions.  It could have been a thoughtfully laid out plot, with several comedic scenes.  When you have all of these stars in one movie, you expect some laughs.  Instead it went the easy route, and we spend the next hour watching David Spade and Rob Schneider getting smacked in the face several times while avoiding falling arrows plummeting from the sky.  I am not a huge Rob Schneider fan, but watching him interact with his wife, who exceeds him in age by 25 years or so, led to me laughing uncontrollably on several occasions.  For the record, I said the show was all slapstick.  I never said that I didn't enjoy some of the knock down humor at times.

As with all plot lacking movies, the ending was all too cheesy as the director suddenly decided to teach us a life lesson instead of continuing with the mindless humor.  In my book this is always what differentiates the great comedies from the mediocre ones.  If you are building up your audience for an hour plus on thoughtless humor, don't try ending the movie with anything more than thoughtless humor.  It really does insult our intelligence.  So with their rivals in place the five take another stab at beating their basketball rivals in a big basketball finale, which falls about as short as they do in their forty year old middle aged bodies.

I again think we as the audience should be able to pick up on the clues commercials give us and make educated decisions.  I went into this movie thinking it would be nothing more than exactly what it was.  Not that I am not surprised both positively and negatively at times, but this movie was pretty clear on what you were getting and with that I think it delivered.  I had several laughs, some of them pretty darn loud, and I didn't have to think at all, for even a single second.  Since I watched it after downing several glasses of wine after a fantastic dinner that was the end of a very nice evening.

Maybe that is the key to mindless humor.  Enter the theater slightly inebriated and the jokes are just a little funnier.  I enjoyed the movie in general, but wouldn't recommend it to any of my ""intellectual"" friends.  They just wouldn't get it.",1278806400,5,3809,4.496360989810771
4033191,1,B002ZG97U6,"Most times it was painful to watch and I just wanted to get away.  The jokes were not funny at all.  Adam Sandler keeps telling the nanny to study, oh yeah, get out those books and study for the big test.  It wasn't funny the first time, so why would it be funny the fifth time?

It's very lame to see: a child drink milk from his mother, have children say stuff just for shock effect, have people fall or crash into buildings, the hot daughters, etc.

The plot of the movie is family, keeping the family together,etc.  You just have to trudge through very lame jokes and bad acting until you finally get to the plot.  Yes, I admit, there were a few GREAT laughs though, but just a few, very few.

The movie was just a weekend in the life of a bunch of long-time friends.  Overall, wasn't funny or exciting or interesting, but in the end, it had a good ""message"" to tell its audience about appreciating what you have in life.",1278633600,3,925,4.24
4033192,5,B002ZG97U6,"I saw this movie the weekend it came out in theaters and I thought it was very funny. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. If you believe the jokes were juvenile and old...yes they were, but that is why you went to this movie in the first place. If you go to see an Adam Sandler movie, this is what you should expect.",1278374400,2,320,3.791044776119403
4033193,2,B002ZG97U6,"If you've seen the previews for Grown Ups, then you have already seen many of the good gags from the movie.  I saw this movie in a one-third full theatre and early in the story, most of the laughter I heard in the theatre was done by the stars of the movie, laughing at their own jokes.

Briefly, here are the main characters:

- Adam Sandler plays Lenny Feder, a Hollywood agent with a fashion designer wife, Roxanne Chase-Feder (Salma Hayek). They have spoiled brat kids who text their needs to the nanny. Feder seems embarrassed by his success and is teased by the other guys for being wealthy and for having gone ""Hollywood."" He spends most of the movie unnecessarily trying to hide the fact that he and his wife have a nanny for their kids.

- Eric Lamonsoff (Kevin James) is a lawn furniture salesman who is married with kids and a dog, and is not as successful as he is trying to appear. He is the butt of a constant stream of jokes about his weight, but I'm not sure James is a large enough man to make this joke funny throughout the movie - it gets very old very quickly.

- Kurt McKenzie (Chris Rock) is an unemployed, stay-at-home dad who spends his days trying new recipes and being insulted by his wife and live-in mother-in-law.

- David Spade plays Marcus Higgins, the single, girl crazy party animal who truly hasn't grown up yet.

- Rob Hilliard (Rob Schneider) is a sensitive, metaphysical vegan who is teased relentlessly by the other guys because he is married to a much older woman.

The group reunites when they attend their childhood basketball coach's funeral. They then decide to spend a weekend together at a lake house with all of their families. Being in close quarters and reminiscing about their coach forces the friends to examine their own lives and relationships with their families. Feder is particularly upset with the realization that his children are so out of touch from normal childhood experiences. His sons are ridiculously spoiled and irritating and their behavior really comes to light when they spend time at the lake.

The other guys also have issues to work though, from McKenzie's relationship with his wife and treatment from his mother-in-law to Hilliard's regret over how he has treated his daughters.  In the end, there are many admissions, confessions, and vows to be better - from the guys and even some of their wives.

There were some funny bits and laugh-out-loud moments. One particularly funny scene is the ""One, two, three... switch!"" scene (you'll understand that if you see it).  Another is the competition they play where someone shoots an arrow straight up in the air to see who runs away first as the arrow comes down. The looks on their faces as they run are priceless.  Although the movie did get better as it went along and they at least tried to convey some positive messages about relationships and families, with this many comedians, I expected way more laughs. The concept was good, but the script just wasn't strong enough. I suspect there was a lot of ad-libbing going on among the actor/comedians.

I've actually seen reviews where people gave this movie four stars out of five and it makes me wonder how they determined that rating. Even if you are only using other Adam Sandler movies as comparisons, this is not even close to the best in his repertoire.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reign-Over-Me-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000QFCCR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reign Over Me (Widescreen Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wedding-Singer/dp/0780622588/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wedding Singer</a>, and<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spanglish/dp/B0007OCG56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spanglish</a>and so many others are way better than this movie.

4033194,4,B002ZG97U6,"I thought this movie was incredibly funny and filled with plenty of decent dirty jokes. It has great comedic actors such as Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, and Rob Schneider all together in the same movie. My only complaint was that it didn't have too much of a plot or a conflict. It's one joke after another. When their basketball coach dies, Lenny, Eric, Kurt, Marcus, and Robert all meet up again for the funeral. They all get to meet each others family and have fun during the 4th of July weekend. Their rival from the past wants a rematch basketball game to see who is the best. I would definitely recommend GROWN UPS!!!",1277856000,,646,4.52991452991453
4033195,2,B002ZG97U6,"The title, previews, and premise give the appearance that viewers will be treated to a post-adolescent brand of comedy, where childish thoughts and acts are left behind for a more refined sense family and friendship, but oftentimes a more crude and adult brand of humor.  Unfortunately, this is not what happens.  Instead, shackled by the desire to remain family-friendly, the movie comes off as a cheap version of<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Couples-Retreat/dp/B002ZGW92E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Couples Retreat</a>with less legitimate laughs.

Five best friends in the late 70s, a championship basketball team, coached by a man who had a profound influence on their lives, reunite some thirty years later when coach dies.  The young boys are now family men (Sandler, Rock, Spade, Schneider, James) - some successful, some not, others typecast misfits - who must return to their triumphant boyhood memories to reminisce, reflect, bust each others' balls, and generally enjoy themselves in spite of the somber occasion.  Sounds fun, right!?  The problem: they bring their families, full of associated oddities and difficulties.  This is a problem because Sandler and co-writer Ron Wolf got stuck in between target audiences.  For every chuckle-worthy crack delivered between old friends (i.e. adult humor) there are two completely unfunny moments that spoiled quicker than breast-milk.

The casting in and of itself is stupendous, and I see their demographically influenced intentions, but the results are subtraction by addition.  Reuniting old SNL cast-members and various comic friends, with James providing a poor man's Farley, is obviously for young adults.  Adding in Selma Hayek, Maria Bello, and Maya Rudolph was a great way to keep the adult male audience entertained (not to mention the addition of two gorgeous, bikini-clad women, Jamie Chung and Madison Riley).  A wise cracking Big Momma rip-off was added alongside a really lame comedy skit (with Tim Meadows) from Rock's 1999 routine explicitly for the Tyler Perry audience.  A woman in her mid-70s was added (as Schneider's wife, ugh) to bring in the Metamucil crowd.  Sprinkle in a several kids, some of them completely loathsome, and the result is movie meatloaf.

Unfortunately, the screenplay is not much better.  Far too often there is a reliance on retread jokes and situations, which accentuates the movie's recycled feeling.  Flawed and disjointed, it's once again target audience ambivalence.  Either the kids deliver the one-liners to elicit the ""awwws,"" or the adults deliver for ""guffaws.""  You can't have it both ways.  When the gags are humorous, however, it's best not to use them until glue oozes from the horse.  Clearly Sandler has never heard the phrase ""less is more.""

Overall, the direction and result of ""Grown Ups"" is one that never fulfills the promise of the title.  Instead, growth is stunted; stuck in the voice-cracking, awkward pubescent years, the ensemble relies upon sounds and fluids from various bodily orifices to fill plot gaps during their movie version of a roast, while futile attempts at sentimentality and misplaced life-lessons muddy the waters.  It's clear making the movie was a blast, but watching it pales in comparison.  The movie, much like Sandler, is stuck in perpetual puberty.

4033196,2,B002ZG97U6,"Somewhere within ""Grown Ups"" is a film that can be taken seriously. There are good themes at work: Friendship, family, generation gaps, the ups and downs of marriage, whether or not aging is the same as maturing. The problem is, none of it shines through the murk of its incessant low grade comedy; rather than make us laugh with genuinely funny material, writers Adam Sandler and Fred Wolf rely on juvenile jokes that put all emphasis on unrealistic personality quirks. It's all character and no development. They also go for unpleasant sight gags, including bodily harm, unwanted brief nudity, urinating in the pool, and worst of all, several awkward and disgusting references to breast milk. Forget about the characters - the filmmakers are the ones that need to grow up.

The premise centers on five friends, who as kids back in 1978 were part of their school's Basketball team. Thirty years later, we find each of them living completely different lives. Lenny Feder (Sandler) is a successful Hollywood agent. Eric Lamonsoff (Kevin James) claims he's the head of a lawn furniture company. Kurt McKenzie (Chris Rock) is a stay-at-home dad. Rob Hilliard (Rob Schneider) is a holistic typecast who seemingly always preferred older women. The only one of the group to have escaped marriage and family is Marcus Higgins (David Spade), an overage sexaholic party animal. Upon the death of the coach who led them to victory, they return to their New England hometown with their families and spend the Fourth of July holiday at a lakeside summer house; here, the five friends will reminisce, fight, rediscover, reveal, and, according to the film's title, grow.

For Lenny, it's a personal mission to get his family to see what real life is like. His wife, Roxanne (Salma Hayek Pinault), is a workaholic fashion designer with an impending show in Milan. His two adolescent sons are spoiled, addicted to texting and violent video games, always waited on hand and foot, preferring imported bottled water, accustomed to five-star accommodations at hotels, and apparently unaware that television sets existed before the days of flat screens. They bring along their nanny, a tiresome Asian stereotype (Di Quon), although Lenny desperately tries to convince his friends that she a foreign exchange student and not hired help. Something could have been made of this had it not been overshadowed by shallow, obvious humor; his kids are ridiculous Hollywood caricatures with no traces of believability, and his wife is stylistically out of place, not at all helped by the fact that Salma Hayek was wrong for the role.

Other bizarre personalities emerge. Eric's wife, Sally (Maria Bello), still breastfeeds their four-year-old son, and as it so happens, the kid constantly craves milk. Kurt's pregnant wife, Deanne (Maya Rudolph), always takes him for granted and can never say anything nice about his cooking; the same goes for her mother (Ebony Jo-Ann), who's always butting in and has terrible bunions. Rob's wife, Gloria (Joyce Van Patten), is in her mid seventies, while his three daughters - two of them smoking hot bimbos, one a dorky misfit - spend as much time as they can being the source of many appearance-related jokes. Rob is the film's worst character, fleshed out solely by exaggerated holistic traits and general social and physical oddness; one wonders how he could ever be friends with the other four, or rather, how they could ever be friends with him.

The film's climax involves a Basketball rematch between the five friends and their former rivals, led by Colin Quinn, who always believed the game from thirty years ago was unfairly won. While there is a moral to this scene, it doesn't resonate, and that's because it's masked by the film's immature tone. It's also delivered far too late in the story, at which point we no longer care about the characters or their circumstances. I'm well aware that humor can often times be found in very serious situations, but that's not what's going on here; it's a sophomoric and silly buddy film through and through. The more reserved and mature themes near the end seem like afterthoughts, as if Sandler and Wolf decided at the last minute to decided to tack them on. That way, their screenplay could actually be about something.

To me, this isn't a question of whether or not you're an Adam Sandler fan. I say this because every review I've read seems to think this somehow matters: ""If you're an Adam Sandler fan, you're going to like this movie."" How about if you're a fan of comedy? I think that's the real criteria, here. I very much consider myself a fan. The thing is, even comedies should have standards, and in the case of ""Grown Ups,"" they're in short supply. It has no ambition other than to be goofy and gross. It generates laughs not by respecting the intelligence of the audience, but simply by appealing to the lowest common denominator. On a more positive note, I will give David Spade credit for being the only actor I know of to successfully say ""grody,"" a word that hasn't been popular for quite some time.",1277424000,4,5077,4.898837209302326
