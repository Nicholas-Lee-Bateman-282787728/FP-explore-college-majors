1540661,5,B00005JOD6,"Molly Dodd was a wistful and wonderful series, an engaging mix of comedy and drama, joy and tragedy.  Great location shots filmed on the streets of NYC, a great mix of seasoned film and theater actors, and no intrusive laughtrack to tell us what was supposed to be funny.  I will not forget how deftly the series captured the sometimes unexplainable feeling of loneliness that one can feel even in a city the size of Manhattan.  Blair Brown was an exquisite, vibrant Molly and the supporting cast was a dream.  I anxiously await a box set of this fantastic series.",1123286400,12,564,4.61
1540662,5,B00005JOD6,"THE DAYS AND NIGHT'S OF MOLLY DODD was one of the most intelligent, funny and refreshing shows on TV.  I have every episode on VHS recorded when the show was in it's original run almost 20 years ago and I think it is still quality TV that a new generation would definately enjoy!",1122508800,5,279,4.264150943396227
1540663,5,B00005JOD6,"I fell in love with this show when it first aired, oh, so many years ago.  The characters so so well written and portrayed.  The zany, colorful friends and family Molly had, it was almost a precursor to Seinfeild, Friends and Gilmore Girls.  I remember when it got cancelled and went to a cable network, I didn't have cable back then so I never found out who the father of her baby was.  I loved her mother, so sassy.  David Strathairn, who played the bookstore owner's son...I LOVED him, still do.  And Blair Brown has yet to play another compelling character on television.  PLEASE put this out on DVD!!!!!",1122249600,100,608,4.522935779816514
1540664,5,B00005JOD6,"This incredibly intelligent program aired at a time when I was living in the country with no cable or satellite service so my recetption was mangled by rabbit ears. But I still taped all the epidsodes. On BETA! I never did transfer all the episodes to VHS because I mananaged to keep at least one of my two BETA recorders working until a few years ago. Now I am desperate for a strong dose of Molly Dodd. The characters were so richly drawn and the stories bizarre and normal at the same time. Molly was unlike any sitcom heroine to date and in the hands of Blair Brown you wanted to be in her circle of friends and family. From time to time I will see an actor who played a regular or recurring character on Molly Dodd and twenty years later I still think of them as ""that guy or woman from Molly Dodd.""

We must have Molly Dodd on DVD!",1121990400,44,837,4.166666666666667

We can only hope that The Powers That Be come to their senses and release box sets of this often-brilliant -- and, of late, little-seen -- dramedy on DVD.

1540755,5,B00005JOD6,This was a fabulous series. I'm sick that I may never see it again.

This show was a trail blazer for the likes of 30 Rock and New Adventures of Old Christine. Single women dump the spunk.  I was shocked they filmed 65 episodes according to imdb.

1540763,5,B00005JOD6,"I come to this site often, hoping that something has happened to get us our Molly DVD's, but so far, no luck!  I loved the show, although came upon it a little late. Also, I was in the Navy and had to go overseas so I missed the last year.  The ensemble was the best I've come across and there have been some pretty terrific ensembles over the many years I've been watching television.  Also enjoyed Mr. Tarses' role as the trash collector (what a cute guy)!!  Also loved the theme song.  I have that on permanent rotation on my iPhone.  I didn't realize there were VHS tapes and wish I knew someone nearby that had them.  Anyway, I hope we get really lucky sooner than later (or never).",1390521600,7,687,4.27906976744186
1540764,5,B00005JOD6,"This show had a unique sweet, quirky comedy style and I envy all the reviewers who say they still have it on tape (which won't last, as we know). After all this time I can remember only a few things -- the sardonic, literate elevator man, the Indian employer who promised to join Molly to his hip; the musician boyfriend who gave her a CD of his latest album back when the format was new and puzzling -- and the fact that I planned my week around watching the show. I want my Molly.",1389916800,2,482,4.138297872340425
1540814,5,B00005JOD6,"Let's start with the great. Jay Tarses is a genius and this series was as unique a concept as any network dared to air. ""The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd"" didn't break the mold of what excellence on television should be, it actually created a new genre: the ""dramedy."" Brilliant scripts performed by the best actors in the business, and story lines that were as quirky and unexpected as the titular character. Calista Flockhart really owes her role in ""Ally McBeal"" to Blair Brown's Molly Dodd.

But here's why I don't think we'll ever get that Molly DVD release we had hoped for... There are several reasons, actually. The first is that the show was split between two networks, NBC and then eventually Lifetime. While some series have managed to get all episodes out when airing on more than one network, they usually have a big studio like a Fox, Paramount or Sony behind them as parent owners. ""Molly"" doesn't have that element.

There are royalty issues with music. As we have seen on other DVD releases, like ""WKRP in Cincinnati"" and ""Daria,"" this can slow down a release for years, even decades, as it's determined who holds the rights to various pieces of music and it's calculated about how much the cost will be. This alone can often stop everything.

The ratings were not there. Though anyone who managed to find the program probably at least admired the brilliance of the performances, when the show aired, it didn't do well as far as Nielsen points. That translates into even fewer people who might be interested in purchasing a DVD. I hope this element can be ignored with the process that allows a box set to be made when ordered, something that is happening with the also unfairly canceled ""Bridget Loves Bernie.""

And finally as time goes on, none of us are getting younger and there will be fewer of us who would really want the complete series of this program, making it less and less likely to get that DVD release the longer we have to wait for it.

To wit, I fear if we don't get ""The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd"" by 2017 (the show's 30th anniversary year), it just isn't going to happen.

Consider this a challenge to Mr. Tarses and all other people that can help with it to prove me wrong!",1388620800,44,2215,4.538847117794486
1540815,5,B00005JOD6,"I watched in the late 80's/early 90's when it was on lifetime.  It's been my favorite TV show since.  It doesn't look like it's ever going to come out on DVD; fortunately I still have VHS tapes.  All the characters were so wonderful, and so well written.  They all seemed like real people.

Gentle in its portrayals, perceptive in its details, and hopeful in its philosophy, the world of Molly is one to which you will return often, with never a disappointment.

The only drawback, of course, is that the DVD is not to be found.

No program before or since has captured the bittersweet elements of life so realistically and entertainingly.  The writing was superb, the casting perfect, and the acting absolutely top-notch.  I have a million memories of this series and quote it all the time (""Who writes this crap?""; ""More pork things!"").

Happily, I believe that there remains an audience for the sort of dialogue that pervades ""Molly Dodd""....so good it doesn't require tinned laughter or smug camera angles.

""The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd"" was smart, droll, and sophisticated to a degree that it expected its audience to think.

""Sex and the City"" titillated.

""The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd"" edified.

Also, as a music lover, I am STILL totally gassed by this show's juicy theme song, written and arranged by the legendary Patrick Williams.

Some years ago, he wrote a tune titled ""Too Hip for the Room."" I don't know if he intended it, but the title describes this great composer!

I cannot recall each episode, of course, but there is one in particular that I think of anytime I come awake in the night after thinking I have heard a suspicious noise.

1541077,3,B00005JOD6,"I haven't read all the reviews but I thought I give my two cents worth.  I remember watching the series when it aired in the late 1980's and had something of a love/hate attitude toward it.  I love Blair Brown although the only program I saw her in extensively was James Michener's Space; a mini-series that met with mostly negative reviews but I thought Brown's did a good job in her role as Penny Pope.  I also loved her role in Altered States and more recently in her somewhat cameo role in Space Cowboys which starred her Space co-star James Garner.

The problem I had with the series was that I thought the humor was a little over the top.  It's been some 16 years since I watched an episode and that was only because I caught a few shows on A&E I think when I subscribed to cable.  I never seen all the episodes simply because although I loved the star I hated the plot.",1217376000,,876,4.246987951807229

I loved Molly Dodd and I can't believe it was ever cancelled.  She out-Mary Tyler Moore'd, Mary Tyler Moore in her heyday!  Of course there was the fantastic New York City apartment that no one ever finds except television characters, the liveried doorman cum elevator operator who never expected a tip, the dead father who was still walking and talking in real life, and the rich boyfriend of her widowed mother who arranged a dream job--no work for high pay, but who's quibbling with perfection?

There are many, many programs that can trace their roots back to Molly - Seinfeld, Friends, Sex and the City, Will and Grace, all the big hit comedies, and a whole lot of not so big ones. Blair Brown's Molly was the next step after Mary Tyler Moore, Marlo Thomas, Valerie Harper and the whole lot of other iconic actresses portraying a single woman's journey through life in a big city. The music, the quirkiness, the expert casting of all the parts, big and small (others have mentioned Gina Gershon, David Straithairn, Robert Lawson, John Pankow - remember John Glover?) - so many intelligent and interesting elements came together to create this truly one of a kind program. And let's not forget there was actual good acting going on. And character development. And complex storylines. We get so much drek on TV and DVD these days.

That was such an extreme left turn in tone and Blair Brown's portrayal so raw it shook me up as much as anything I saw on the Sopranos).

From its elegant and hip theme song to its totally unique and slightly magical characters, I have loved this show from its first episode. I still believe it was ahead of its time, and never got the proper attention it so richly deserved. My former husband declared that Molly Dodd's life was a completely accurate mirror of my own (except that I'm African-American and Southern).  Certainly, Molly and I shared a worldview that remains most delightfully quirky and unforced.

My absolute favorite line from the series comes at the beginning of the episode that begins with Molly's father's burial.  Molly's mother starts her narrative with ""The less said about this, the better, thank you very much."" She ends her reflections on the impact of her husband's death upon her family with this simple, eloquent, and profound line: ""...but I shall miss him the most, because he was my man.""

I particularly enjoyed the mystical elements to the show, highlighted by the space-bending ninja Chinese food delivery man and Molly's talks with her deceased father. Now, I love Gilmore Girls, Woody Allen movies and all episodes of Lou Grant, Mary Tyler Moore and Murphy Brown, but Molly Dodd ranks above all of them for the show's quiet beauty and off-center approach to a real woman's reality.

1541428,5,B00005JOD6,"There were times during the run of the show that looking forward to a new episode of Molly Dodd got me through the week, and many moments indelibly etched in my memory:  Bing's (Nathan Lane) do-anything service for busy New Yorkers; dreamy Moss (David Strathairn) describing seeing Ingrid Bergman sunbathing when he was a boy; Molly's mother's bemused description of Molly's adoration for Ella Fitzgerald as her ""desire to be an elderly Negro songstress""; Victor Garber's sleazy real estate agent--and of course, the incandescent Blair Brown as Molly, the girl whose problems we all wished we had--they were so much more interesting than our own. This is the one TV series boxed set I would definitely buy!  Please make it possible!",1123632000,10,732,5.041322314049586
7941085,5,B00005JOD6,"Yet another fan of Molly Dodd waiting and waiting for the release of the DVD.  Still have some VHS tapes, but would love to watch a dvd on a bigger screen than my tiny 1980s television.  And how wonderful to see Blair Brown talking about the show, not to mention the remarkable supporting cast.  As so many others have noted, the show has a haunting, yearning quality, was intelligent, charming, offbeat, and never crude.  And no laugh track, thank heavens!  A show that could never be made today, alas.  What I wonder--is anyone actively working on making this happen?  I dearly hope so.",1525392000,,588,4.650485436893204
7941086,5,B00005JOD6,Please don't tease us like that!  I can't wait until they can get all the legal stuff and royalties straightend out so we can enjoy one of the best shows ever put on television.,1515024000,,177,4.205882352941177
7941087,5,B00005JOD6,Im adding my voice to these many others. I loved Molly Dodd for many reasons already mentioned. I would buy this dvd were it available. I hope it happens. Wondering why I was notified of availability if it isn't available at this time,1514937600,2,234,4.465116279069767
7941088,5,B00005JOD6,"Great great show. I've been looking for the series since I got access to the Internet in the 90's.  If they ever DO release this to DVD, I'd buy it...at almost any price.  This caliber of entertainment is not readily available these days.",1514937600,2,238,4.511627906976744
7941089,5,B00005JOD6,"Also got the email about availability and the subsequent advice that it was not available - cmon Amazon, smarten up.  Cannot add anything to the other (positive) reviews: the fact that this Australian has remembered the series from three and a half decades ago when it was shown on our national broadcaster at a very late hour says it all about how brilliant and ahead of its time it was.  30 Rock must have been somewhat inspired by it.",1514937600,35,437,4.518987341772152
7941090,5,B00005JOD6,"Just received an email from Amazon alerting me that ""The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd"" is now available on DVD.
Added it to my cart to read it is not currently available.
What a disappointment.",1514851200,100,194,4.416666666666667
7941091,5,B00005JOD6,"Just spent about an hour reading all the 110 reviews presently here. It brings back many memories that I had enjoyed on ""Days & Nights of Molly Dodd"", a few of which I had forgotten.

Some very memorable ones: John Glover as her cousin from ""Bal'mer"" (Baltimore), Allison Ann McCleary as her mom (talk about perfect casting), David Strathairn as the dorky bookstore owner, Nathan Lane as a jack-of-trades. For those of you who haven't seen (or just can't remember some of it) there are no spoilers here!

The music, of course, is the thing: Fred Dodd as a jazz saxophonist and Molly as the band's singer. The music selections for each episode were all very fitting. I am still haunted by the gorgeous rendition of ""What are You Doing New Year's."" If I could remember who played it, I'd rush out to get the CD. But if you are wondering what's with the royalties, just remember EACH SONG can have copyrights for the composers, lyricists, agents, managers, arrangers, producers, recording companies, distributors, back-up bands, etc., everybody standing around with their hands out! (and people wonder why singers & musicians should be paid for streaming!)

I also am a two decade survivor of the ""waiting for the DVD or CD game"" that the entertainment industry has thrust upon us. It isn't fair but most of the industry is controlled by greedy fatcats who just want their cut$. What would be fair is that when a song is negotiated for TV, it should be with the condition that it can be used in conjunction with that show for duplication, much like what is done in films. The movie industry does not come out with different music when the credits are running.

A bit of trivia: anyone know the name of the actor (who played Molly's boyfriend) who was on the airplane that crashed into the Potomic River in Washington D.C. several winters ago due to iced wings? He was a survivor.",1514332800,8,1876,4.675757575757576
7941092,5,B00005JOD6,"This show was SO relevant, thought-provoking, intelligent, funny and appropriate for it's time. Wasn't it on LATE at night? I'd buy it in a heartbeat.  F*** Hollywood and it's ""issues"". You know HOW much lackluster, crappy, nonsense is available for sale on DVD?  You know, I think I might have ""taped"" it on VCR! Ha! In storage, of course/curse!",1501372800,11,346,4.8474576271186445
