5751407,2,B00CXAEFQK,"So there's risque language without the body-talk to back it up. It's like watching pretty girls and guys chatting stereotypically inside a teenager's dream with neither style nor substance.  I gave up with this film after this dialogue came out:  ""Fleas are people too."".",1378339200,3,271,5.136363636363637
5751408,5,B00CXAEFQK,"I LOVED this - I felt like i was watching friends of mine on tv.
what makes it especially entertaining is that the people are real, the situations are real (hilarious) and the outcomes are real...
I wish this were a series!! need more...",1378080000,,237,4.409090909090909
5751409,5,B00CXAEFQK,"A lighthearted comedy that almost gets too serious, but enjoyable all the way through, with an ending that makes everything all worthwhile! Lacey Chabert hands in a terrific job of acting, where you might just believe she IS her character who can't find that right man.

Although not a main character, SNL's Chris Kattan is always good for comic relief, too!

Because of subject content and language, I would recommend SSILA for 18 and over.",1376352000,,441,4.866666666666666

5751412,4,B00CXAEFQK,"It's more of a 3 1/2 star movie, but that's not an option, so I'll round up to 4 since Lacey Chabert is quite the trooper in this film: not only letting some guy shove toes in her mouth in one early scene and putting up with bad hair through most of the movie but, most surprising of all, going without makeup for a key scene later in the movie.

The bad: I am not a fan of voice overs in movies, generally, and Ms. Chabert is given a lot of them by the screenwriter/director.  Jonathan Bennett plays an out gay character who is terribly hammy early on, in part due to some weird dialogue for his intro.

The good: it's a pretty standard, in which nothing happens that you don't expect to happen, rom-com, with some lovely people to look at including Ms. Chabert (attractive even with bad hair), Jenna Dewan-Tatum, Mr. Bennett and Kip Pardue.  Chris Kattan has a small but meaty role.  If you're looking for a very light rom-com, you'll enjoy this, if you're looking for something more, you won't.",1436313600,2,997,4.396739130434782

5751423,4,B00CXAEFQK,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect in this movie and to be honest I mainly watched it because Lacy Chabert was in it so I figured it wouldn't be too bad. Truthfully it was actually pretty good and it's about people looking for love and often overlooking what's right in front of them! I would describe it as a nice feel good romcom and yes, horror movies aside I;m a sucker for a good romantic comedy, it's a character flaw! This is without a doubt a chick flick but guys if you're looking to score points with your significant other than you could do worse!",1399939200,5,558,4.273584905660377
5751424,1,B00CXAEFQK,This movie is one of the worst I have seen. To give you an idea is a bad version between Sex and the city with ridiculus caracters and not even funny.,1398297600,3,150,3.870967741935484

5751427,3,B00CXAEFQK,In a long line of so very many love stories this falls in the middle.  It's not bad and not really good.  I would't watch it again.,1390953600,2,131,3.814814814814815

8587198,4,B00CXAEFQK,"Moving to LA- it seemed like a good idea at the time. Dale (Lacey Chabert) can't seem to make things work - at work, with her friends, and definitely not with men. In acity where hype, hookups, and heartbreak are as common as reality shows, it's hard to find something real. She manages to hook up with every type of oddball and strange-oid in L.A. What we have here is a very talented and sweet and attractive cast. All very capable and all very much into their parts. This ight knit group of girl friends are as different as night and day and this makes for some wonderful chuckles and entertainment. Kip Pardue as the object of 2 friends affections is very cute. Now for the saying! This is cute and cute is the very best word for this movie. Not much that is innovative but it is Very Cute. Cute, sweet and very light. Do I recommend it? Sure I do. it hits all the usual topics and moves very nicely, nothing groundbreaking but still very fun.",1487030400,,947,4.325842696629214
