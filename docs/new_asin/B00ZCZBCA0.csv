8719837,3,B00ZCZBCA0,"The production was well done, but I was disappointed this turned out to be not much more than visually ""reading the manual"" to me for various settings in the submenus. I'd purchased instructional DVDs for my new Nikon D90 back in late 2008, and those were much more helpful than this DVD. Of course, as always, ""your mileage may vary"".
