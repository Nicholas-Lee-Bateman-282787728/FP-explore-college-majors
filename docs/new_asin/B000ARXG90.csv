2391086,3,B000ARXG90,"I liked this movie but I am tired of almost every african american movie has to contain some chistianity in it. I'm a christian but there is no need to constantly shove religion down others throats when they can simply make an honest movie about love and life. Leave jesus out of these movies, enough is enough already we get it.",1253923200,,329,4.409836065573771
2391087,3,B000ARXG90,"THE WALK IS A CONTEMPORY URBAN FEATURE FILM CHRONICLING A TURBULENT TIME IN THE LIFE OF SYDNEY, A FRUSTRATED YOUNG WOMAN STRIGGLING WITH NUMEROUS TUMULTUOUS RELATIONSHIPS.  STARRING: EVE PIGFORD, TECH HOLMES AND REGINA BELL",1230681600,,223,5.5588235294117645
2391088,4,B000ARXG90,"The movie was ok, Eva needs to work on her acting skills a little more.",1173571200,,71,3.8
2391089,2,B000ARXG90,"I, as others have stated, picked this one up because I saw Eva Pigford on the cover (and it was only $5.50 at Wal-Mart).  In spite of the obvious fact that this film had a very low budget, and substandard equipment, the acting could have been much better.

At times, I think the delivery would have been better if the characters had read straight from the script, rather than having what they attempted to memorize spew from their mouths with little to no effort or emotion.

I enjoyed this one over a rainy day of movie watching and found the story to be somewhat convoluted, unrealistic and sketchy at times.  By the end of the movie, you get the point, but don't quite understand the route used to get the viewer there.  Important facts were omitted and unnecessary fluff added...

If you happen to come across it at a friend or family members' house, pop it in.  But by no means should anyone go out in search of this one to add to their movie collection.

Not mad about spending the $5.50...but I wouldn't recommend this one to others.",1172016000,,1040,4.465608465608466
2391090,2,B000ARXG90,"This film is about a girl who gets into the wrong crowd after her father's death. I found it was disjointed though.  Tek's character was interesting while Eva's was not developped. The film had some kind of haze in many of the scenes (useless as far as i am concerned
).  Sometimes shes dreaming, other's she's not and you can't tell one from the other.  The acting didn't seem to come natural. The film could have included more scenes which would have showed how hard it was for Eva's character. In the end she just comes around and her Christian mother couldn't be happier.
There are better inspirational films to choose from.",1164326400,,628,4.589285714285714
2391091,3,B000ARXG90,"I hate to 'trash' a movie that is trying to bring a good message about Christianity, but this movie suffers in several ways.  First, the photography is somewhat strange, with an eerie light cast over the whole movie.  Second, the acting is just that, acting; few, if any, of the characters have done enough acting to really be able to get 'into' their role . . . to make it lifelike.  Finally, I think the plot, or editing, is somewhat confusing so in the end they resort to a long sermon.  The film does try to bring a Christian message, but it is like most 'Christian' movies in that the message is more important than the story, so the story seems contrived to get the message across.  I'd say that this movie is best left to showings in church youth groups where it serves as a springboard for discussion in the group.

[For an outstanding movie with a Christian message that does not in any way seem contrived, see the Disney movie 'Ruby Bridges.']",1154304000,9,953,4.448275862068965
2391092,5,B000ARXG90,"Well I heard good things about ""The Walk"" so I decided to check it out. It's a really good movie that sends a good message. Eva did a really good job (for this to be her 1st leading role) portraying a trouble young woman......& I got ""The Walk"" from Wal-mart for $5.50.",1149465600,7,269,4.1923076923076925
2391093,4,B000ARXG90,This is a great addition to my collection. Some of the acting  needed a little work but overall it had a great plot. This is one of those movies that sends a positive message to the teenage and young adult viewers.,1141257600,3,214,4.219512195121951
2391094,4,B000ARXG90,"""The Walk,"" despite its flaws, has many things to offer the viewer; some very fine performances, a script by Carlyle Chalmers that has relevance, and most of all, lots of heart. Behind the camera, Jon Swindoll has a good eye for composition and color contrasts, keeping our visual attention, and director Thomas Forbes maintains an even pacing that never lags. The plot, though predictable, is well done, and concernes a girl brought up in a close knit Christian family, who goes astray when her father dies, hooks up with a bad guy, has a baby, becomes an insolent brat towards her mother, etc. She gets in trouble through her connection to a stolen credit card, has to do community service, and meets the young minister in charge of troubled youth, bringing her to ""come the full circle through divine guidance.""

The cast is interesting, and often very good. Eva Pigford is gorgeous (she won the ""America's Next Top Model"" contest) and does well as Sydney, the central figure in the story. Exceptional are R&B singer Regina Bell as Sylvia, her mother, and Teck Holmes (""The Real World"") as the young man, Rev. Whitman Hester, who preaches about Elijah (1 Kings 18) in a rousing sermon. Also memorable are Charles Black as Reverend Baker, Courtney Wilson as the tough detective, and in a bizarre bit of humor, Alex Orr as ""The Nutty Chef."" Filmed on location in the Atlanta, Georgia area, this is a fine Christian family film. Total running time is 80 minutes.",1131753600,13,1462,4.778656126482214
2391095,4,B000ARXG90,"I pick it up because Eva Pigford was on the cover, but I purchase it because Tech Holmes was in the movie, a high school classmate.  Tech and Eva and especially Regina Bell gave a great performance.  It had a good message and it was very funny.  I know I'm going to buy another one for a Christmas gift.",1131321600,8,303,4.101694915254237

8079403,3,B000ARXG90,This movie was o'kay but I have seen better -- like Pastor Jones: Help Save My Daughter.  The pain the lead character had after losing her father seemed very real.  Maybe more help to aid her to get out of this grief would have helped.,1384732800,,235,4.2

8079405,5,B000ARXG90,I used this movie for the movie night at my church. It was awesome based on 2 John 1:6.  It is a excellent movie for young ladies in the church.,1365465600,,144,3.8

8079407,4,B000ARXG90,"Eva is in this one and boy is she the exact same Eva in top model. bad attitude and same exact persona. She basically in my opinion played the part of herself. Very tough, arrogant and stuck up. She does however do this job well, I must say. The other actors are terrible in the entire movie. The plot is sending a great message about Christianity however which because Eva does such a great job being a b*tch, it will work.",1265500800,,424,4.246913580246914

8079409,4,B000ARXG90,"Decent performances, but EXCEPTIONAL message! Touches big on everything from faith, marriage, and family to drugs and AIDS. Good soundtrack and some funny parts too. I am very, very glad to have this film. It might be low-budget, but they really focused on a strong message, and I think that was a very good choice!",1255996800,,315,4.745454545454545
