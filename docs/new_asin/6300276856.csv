7808652,5,6300276856,"When I was a younster in the 1980's I had a worn out VHS tape with two cartoons on it copied from T.V. One was WATER BABIES and the other was LAMBERT THE SHEEPISH LION. Both are great cartoons. Lambert the Sheepish Lion can be found on The Rarities box set in the silver tin. My all time favorite and hardest cartoon to find,Water Babies is only on VHS-Silly Symphonies Cartoon Classics volume four. I was spell bound by this cartoon as a little girl.
