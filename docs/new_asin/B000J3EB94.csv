8149081,2,B000J3EB94,"This Sonny Chiba collection was very disappointing. To begin with personally I find the use of flying ninjas and samurai rather silly. These movies bound with that. The writing is very poor. It's sci-fi samurai throughout. The action scenes are played out by people who are obviously actors and not martial artists. In other samurai movies that's usually covered up by a quick scene where one never really sees an engagement, just movement and a result. They decided to forgo that in these movies with the exception of ""G. I. Samurai.""

""G.I. Samurai"" starts off with a good idea but the lack of technology at the time and the loose ends just can't sustain it. These movies only really have one thing going for them. Several hot looking Japanese gals doing nude scenes. That's about it, sorry. If you want a better Chiba collection, I suggest, The Shogun Collection. I haven't seen all of the ones in that collection yet, but so far they have been very good. Don't waste your money on this one.",1420070400,,994,4.68
8149082,3,B000J3EB94,"These are a few lesser known Sonny Chiba movies. They are the equivalent of the old ""B"" western movies. They are shot in a very short period, without the greatest of scripts.",1387065600,,174,4.46875
8149083,4,B000J3EB94,"Just buy it! It is ludicrously inexpensive, and you get two and a half great movies out of the deal! Sonny Chiba is a classic bad ass, and this series is mostly good. I really wish they would have replaced G.I. Samurai with a different film however, as it is the clear weak link here, but its still worth it just for Ninja Wars and Legend of the eight samurai. I would have preferred to have Samurai Reincarnation in there myself, but oh well.

G.I. Samurai:
As I said its the weak link. A movie about time traveling Japanese soldiers fighting samurai. Its a bit boring by comparison in my mind. Still a little far out and for what is essentially chump change you could do far worse.

Legend of the Eight Samurai:
This movie is one of my all time favorite fantasy films. It has everything you could ever want. Its like a live action Final Fantasy anime practically. It has weapons, wizards, witches, poison breathing babes, Giant centipedes, old hags that rip off their face, undead samurais, a giant snake, magic crystals, Sonny Chiba... I could keep going but I think it would be best to just watch this one.

Ninja Wars:
Ninja Wars is a close second in the box set. First off the name says it all. Or does it? I don't know. Does the name ninja wars imply that you are going to be watching a movie where two women switch heads, and 7 super human fighting monks terrify the land with powers ranging from super strength to deadly acid vomit? The plot is a bit hard to follow only because two central characters switch heads early on in the movie, at which point I realized I needed a flow chart to keep up with who was who and what they were doing, but finally i just relaxed and shifted my focus to the absurdity and um...ninjas!!!

Its a great box set, and a great bargain. Add this one to your collection.",1287532800,3,1808,4.356083086053412
8149084,4,B000J3EB94,"Sonny Chiba is always great and these three movies are no exception.  Keep in mind they were filmed in the 80's.  Even with that, they're really fun to watch.  Ninja Wars is a bit silly, but then that's what makes it a fun movie to watch.  Don't get this thinking it's Shadow Warriors with all Sonny all of the time.  Get this because you love samurai movies!",1251072000,,359,4.298507462686567
8149085,5,B000J3EB94,"These movies were pretty good, I know I've watched them all more than once and do not regret buying this collection one bit.  Even the boxed case is beautifully done.  There are faults to the movies (I don't really need to say what, the other reviews sum it up) but it's well worth the price and time.  If you are a fan of Samurai films, these movies are worth adding to your collection, especially at such a cheap price.",1247184000,,421,4.30379746835443
8149086,3,B000J3EB94,Great action although the script was lacking. expected a little bit more technique in the fighting,1225324800,,98,5.1875
8149087,5,B000J3EB94,This was just a really exciting collection. All the movies were really entertaining (even though some were really cheesy) they were great.,1199059200,2,138,5.318181818181818
8149088,4,B000J3EB94,I was expecting more traditional samurai films but these are all fantasy.  G.I. Samurai is a time travel movie while the other two are more of the sword and sorcery type.  I enjoyed them all even though Chiba is not the main star of the last two.  This set comes in a nice case that opens up like a book.  A good value for this set.,1185840000,6,332,3.984848484848485
