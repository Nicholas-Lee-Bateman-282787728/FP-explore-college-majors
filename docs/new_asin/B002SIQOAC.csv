Interesting experiment by renowned avante garde French director Maurice Pialat with actress Sabine Haudepin & (due to a very low budget) with a cast of amateurs, mostly from the village the film was shot in.

The plot focuses on the fun & hardships of teens growing up in a small village in late 70's France & issues around working class youth trying to find employment. This was my introduction to Pialat & I'm honestly not certain what I think. While it was fairly easy to watch, at the same time it requires quite a bit of focus. Much of the dialogue was said to be improvised with only a rough plot outline for the new actors to follow.

Has some nice extras, which help explain the film; especially the interviews. One odd fact is that an actor who plays a 30 something teacher in the film was said to be teenager Haudepin's boyfriend in real life!

MOC does their usual excellent job of restoring the print. Region free PAL.",1259452800,,1001,4.483516483516484
