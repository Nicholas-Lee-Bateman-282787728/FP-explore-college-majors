1665689,1,B00005UJY9,I would not recommend this movie. I thought the organization of the movie was poorly done and the sound quality was not that good either.,1379030400,,137,4.52
1665690,2,B00005UJY9,not very good - did not hold my attention and I gave it up early - poor direction and acting,1365033600,2,92,3.65
1665691,5,B00005UJY9,This little known movie tells the side of the Marquis de Sade that we never hear about. The fact that his mother sold him as a child to be raised by relatives in order to keep her beloved jewelry that she held more dear. Another detail not known to me is that he was tricked into marrying a woman when in actuality it was her sister he was in love with. His mother-in-law held him in jail as though he was a prisoner due to not staying home with a wife he was tricked into marrying. Then she placed the daughter he was in love with in a covent only to sell her in marriage to someone of great wealth.,1356739200,,600,4.008333333333334
1665692,5,B00005UJY9,"I'll give it 5 stars! Yep 5 stars! It's not that bad of a movie and you gotta take it for what it is. It's a late 60's psychedlic type of film. Keir Dullea did a pretty good job playing the Marquis. The film tries to stick with the facts of the Marquis' life but at times seems to sway away a bit.

I'm gonna say that we have yet to see an accurate and brilliant film based on the Marquis de sade. Perhaps Benoit Jacquot's Sade would come pretty damn close but I know THE FILM will come in time. And so in the meantime, take De Sade as well as Franco's Justine, and even Quills as fun entertainment.

The only movie that seems to come full cirlce is Pasolini's Salo but that's based on one of The Marquis' writings and not his life. So it doesn't really count.",1181433600,8,760,4.06
1665693,1,B00005UJY9,"Don't be fooled by the AIP pedigree of ""De Sade."" If you expect something like the inventive charge of Roger Corman's low-budget Poe adaptations, you will be seriously disappointed. For this misguided effort is both expensive and serious enough to manage the dubious achievement of making the Marquis de Sade boring.
It is by no means an ordinary failure. Visible talent went into  it, and in fact the most interesting thing about the film is trying to figure out what went wrong. No doubt Richard Matheson's script, which has de Sade dropping in and out of fantasies and memories that may or may not be part of theatrical performances (there's a lot of ""may or may not"" in this movie) is part of the problem. This complex structure does nothing to add coherence to an opaque character, but in the right hands, say a Roger Vadim or a Mario Bava, it might at least make for a lushly fruity, passably entertaining movie.
I've seen only one other film by ""De Sade's"" director, Cy Endfield, the outpost-of-Empire adventure film ""Zulu."" It's a conservative, occasionally handsome bit of film making. Here, he tries all too obviously to make the film ""visual,"" and ""stylish,"" with complex camera movements, shock cutting, disorienting filters, and overripe decor. In the effort to be freewheeling, buxom beauties tumble in and out of de Sade's bed, dwarves deliver his toys on cue, a lot of bric-a-brac gets broken, curtains slashed, paintings burned, repeatedly and endlessly until you can't help wondering if de Sade's problem is simply having too much time and money on his hands. This trash heap of elaborately empty mannerisms proves only that Endfield has no sense at all of what to do with the material.
Keir Dullea turns in as creditable a performance as possible under  circumstances that include his total miscasting. That he isn't convincing for a moment is almost a compliment. It's difficult to imagine how he could be any better when you can't think of anyone who *would* be suitable for the part.
When writer, director and cast exhibit the same symptoms of  distress, that's a pretty good sign that the film should never have been made. There may be a good movie somewhere in the life of de Sade, but this strained, overcooked mishmash certainly isn't it.",1027814400,20,2264,4.860103626943006
1665694,3,B00005UJY9,"To quote the man himself ""I have spanked a few bottoms"" Pretty well somes up this film. The review preceeding mine somes up what I have to say about this film. If you are interested in other films I reconmend marat/sade play set in a bathhouse and Quills a pretty strong work of fiction about the man.",1024099200,2,301,4.298245614035087

7954721,1,B00005UJY9,What a boring movie. It could have been so much more! I really like Keir Dullea but feel he isn't committed to this movie - he's just going thru the motions. His acting is pitiful as are most of the actors. If only someone would remake it and do it Justice. I remember watching the Johnny Depp movie - The Libertine - which I absolutely loved. If only this movie could have been darker and better acted.,1425254400,,403,4.246753246753247

7954728,5,B00005UJY9,"Given the time period in which it was filmed it does De Sade justice.

In a Nutshell: The film focuses on how De Sade's inability to conform to society's and his family's expectations ended up destroying everything around De Sade, including himself.",1389225600,,249,4.928571428571429
