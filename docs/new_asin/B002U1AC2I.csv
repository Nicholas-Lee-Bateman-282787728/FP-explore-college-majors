8380897,5,B002U1AC2I,"The 3-DVD collection includes Dance and Be Fit: Brazilian Body, Dance and Be Fit: Latin Grove, and Dance and Be Fit: Hip Hop Cardio. These are all fun, high energy workouts and feature original music.

Dance and Be Fit: Brazilian Body is lead by Kimberly Miguel Mullen and is a total of 48 minutes in length. Brazilian Body uses elements of Brazilian dances such as the Maculete, Samba Reggae, and Capoeira. It features simple, flowing steps that incorporate hip circles and torso pops. The pulsating Brazilian music makes for a fast-paced cardio workout. The DVD includes a 6 minute warm-up, 12 minute Maculele workout, 12 min Samba Reggae, 12 minute Capoeira and 6 minute cool down. I found this to be the most challenging of the three workouts.

Dance and Be Fit: Latin Groove is lead by Desi Bartlett and is a total of 56 minutes in length. Latin Grove uses steps from the Merengue, the Salsa and the Rumba. The moves are fairly simple to follow although there are some challenging moves in the Merengue segment. This workout features lots of arm movements for a serious cardio workout. The DVD includes a 9 minute workout, 20 minute Merengue Mix, 20 minute Spicy Salsa mix and 7 minute cool down. It also features optional Spanish and Spanglish audio tracks.

Dance and Be Fit: Hip Hop Cardio is lead by Sarita Lou and is a total of 50 minutes in length. Hip Hop Cardio is a high energy dance routine that burns fat and calories while toning your abs, legs and arms. It's invigorating hip-hop pulse offers a workout with attitude. It features moves like hip swings, chest pops, and sexy body rolls. Hip Hop Cardio has a 5 minute warm-up, 20 minute Old School routine, 20 minute Sexy Sculpt routine and 5 minute cool down. It also has a bonus freestyle dance. This routine really appealed to my 16 year old daughter since it resembles the type of dancing that kids her age do.

These three DVDs offer the option of choosing which routine works the best for you. Using your remote control, you can select which routine you want to do to customize it to your interests, abilities and time available. I generally do a warm up, one routine and a cool down but you can choose for yourself.

These are high energy, cardio workouts that will leave you ""glistening"" when you're done. I'd rate them at the intermediate level for ease of following. I had a hard time with a few of the moves but I have no dance background to begin with. Those of you with more grace than me will probably have an easier time. All in all, I highly recommend Dance and Be Fit: Cardio Mix for a good cardio workout!",1273363200,7,2589,4.547210300429184
