8262447,3,B0016GOJXQ,"I rarely saw such sensual scenes and imagery in a Hindi movie. Some dialogues sound racey too (everything remains family-friendly throughout). You'll see lots of beautiful ladies comparatively scantly dressed, but decked out in gorgeous jewellery. All this never gets obtrusively turgid. Untypically as well, the story contains happy adultery, with the cheated-on wife later singing a song with the intruding female (and thanking her for teaching her husband a thing or two on the linen). A nicely choreographed village festival with a large cast ends the movie.

The plot is pedestrian, though, derived from 1600 years old Sanskrit tales: The king's brother loves a luxury call-girl (Rekha) who loves a simple villager. This king's brother is a terrible hooligan with a ridiculous wig and glued-on beard, ruining parts of the movie through outlandish behaviour and the worst imanigable over-acting. He's played by Amjad Khan, back then Bollywood's official villain who shot to fame as Gabbar Singh in Sholay, 1975; but in Utsav, Khan remains very far from his demonic Sholay performance.

I couldn't get enough of the beautiful Rekha. There's something shady about her, or why does she end up in prostitute roles so often; not only Utsav, but also Umrao Jaan and Kamasutra show Rekha involved in adult entertainment; surprisingly, actually, she never played a Chandramukhi in one of Bollywood's numerous Devdas versions. Parineeta and Zubeidaa, two other movies, show Rekha playing a slightly dubious singer or actress. Obviously, Bollywood producers also liked Rekha as an (attempting) adulterer, not also here in Utsav, but also famously so in Silsila (1981; in Silsila she played against the film and real life Bachchan couple, and rumours about an affair between Rekha and Amitabh Bachchan abound; in Silsila, Utsav-producer Shashi Kapoor had a role too). You just want to know why Rekha's real-life husband committed suicide no two years into the marriage.

In Utsav, not only Rekha played a prostitute yet again. You also get the attractive and well acting Neena Gupta; she once started her career with Shyam Benegal's brothel comedy Mandi; much later, Gupta acted in Ghandi.

Utsav has little dance, but charming songs nonetheless. The famous music directors Laxmikant-Pyarelal hold back their usual steam and produce lovely ballads, avoiding sugary sweetness along the way.

The DVD I had was from the Eagle lable. Not constantly, but along long parts of the movie, i saw some of the worst image quality ever, ruining especially the numerous night scenes. Together with the childish plot, the embarrassing villain, the weak villager actor and some boring dialogue, this partly ruined the evening. Obviously, producer Shashi Kapoor lost big money with this movie.",1363132800,2,2771,5.288636363636364
