7881399,1,6305052050,"Don't bother with the public domain episodes of ""The Lucy Show."" You're throwing away your money. The audio and video quality isn't very good. Buy the official season releases of ""The Lucy Show."" We already have seasons one through three out. Season four should be out sometime in March 2011. You won't believe the difference between the shabby quality of the public domain episodes and the unbelievable quality of the official releases. It's like they were filmed a month ago. In addition you get great bonus features. So stop buying the same 30 episodes. I was fooled twice and decided to wait for the real thing.",1291593600,,615,4.811320754716981
7881400,3,6305052050,"The same old recycled ""public domain"" episodes of THE LUCY SHOW...  Just about every single budget-line DVD company you can think of has trundled out these shows.  Serious ""Lucy"" fans have probably purchased the episodes over and over again, but for new viewers looking to introduce themselves to the hilarity of Lucy's world, this is a good place to start.

Five years after the last episode of ""I Love Lucy"" aired, Lucille Ball was back at CBS, sans Desi Arnaz (whom she had divorced by this point) for another shot at sitcom success. THE LUCY SHOW cast Ball as Lucille Carmichael, a widow who lived with her best friend Vivian Bagley (Vivian Vance) and their respective children in a large house in upstate New York. The show was later re-tooled, with Lucy moving to California to work as a secretary for bank manager Mr. Mooney (Gale Gordon).

Episodes:

""Lucy Meets George Burns"" - Lucy becomes George Burns' dazzling new comedy partner in his nightclub act.

""Lucy Meets the Berles"" - Whilst on loan as a secretary to Milton Berle, Lucy suspects the comedian of having an affair with Ruta Lee.

""Lucy Meets John Wayne"" - While on important business for the bank, Lucy disrupts the set of John Wayne's latest movie.

""Lucy the Fight Manager"" - Lucy takes charge of a broken-down prizefighter (Don Rickles).

""Lucy Meets Sheldon Leonard"" - When Sheldon Leonard uses the bank as a backdrop for a TV series, Lucy suspects Leonard of being a real bank robber.

""Lucy Gets Trapped"" - Skipping work to attend a big department store sale, Lucy's plan comes unwound when she's photographed for the newspaper...

""Lucy the Babysitter"" - Miserly Mr. Mooney won't increase Lucy's wage, so she decides to raise extra cash by taking in an innocent little babysitting job...",1283472000,,1765,4.8305647840531565
7881401,5,6305052050,"This second volume of episodes from ""The Lucy Show"" finds the redhead getting into trouble at every opportunity. First up is ""Lucy Gets Trapped"" (Episode #134 September 18, 1967), where Lucy pretends to be ill so she can skip work at the bank and attend a huge sale at a department store. However when she gets there she is named the store's 10 Millionth Customer, which means her picture gets into the newspapers where Mr. Mooney ends up seeing it. In ""Lucy the Baby Sitter"" (#126 January 16, 1967), Lucy is looking for a job where she will be better appreciated after having yet another fight with Mr. Mooney over the quality of her work. At the employment agency they end up sending her to be a babysitter for a family of chimpanzees (The Marquis Chimps). What more do you need to know? ""Lucy the Bean Queen"" (#113 September 26, 1966), finds Lucy wanting to get new furniture for her apartment but Mr. Mooney will not lend her the money. When Lucy sees an ad that you will get double your money back if Bailey's Baked Beans are not the best baked beans you have ever tasted, she and Mary Jane go around L.A. buying up cases of beans and returning them for double their money. There is only one problem. These ARE the best baked beans Lucy has ever tasted. Still, you have to love any episode that puts Lucy on a forklift. Finally, in ""Lucy Meets the Law"" (#129 February 13, 1967), a redheaded female jewel thief manages to put the jewels she stole into Lucy's purse. This means Lucy ends up behind bars having to deal with hardened criminals. An interesting quartet of episodes from the fifth season of ""The Lucy Show,"" and while none of them are classics per se, they are all first-rate examples of Lucy's work at this point in her career.",993772800,2,1743,4.484276729559748
