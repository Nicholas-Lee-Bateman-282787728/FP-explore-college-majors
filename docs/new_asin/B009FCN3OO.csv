8540929,4,B009FCN3OO,"This is a very good, broad if simple summation of all kinds of economic stats and their sources. It is chopped into short segments which have basic but good sound definitions of the sources, their activities, and the related basics. Very helpfully, websites are shown. That's the good part.
  Apart from that (which is the most important part), I was startled at how clunky and amateurish the presentation was. The little title sequence of a very 80s-type animation must be sat through in endless repetitions. Mercifully it is fairly short. The narrator seems to have an east-coast USA accent, and no foreign accent, but is such an awkward reader, it seems as if he is perhaps not a native English speaker, much less a presenter in any professional context. He has long awkward pauses in his sentences, does not read smoothly at all, and mispronounces words oddly -- for example saying ""gauge"" (obviously the right word in an econ-stats presentation) erroneously as ""gouge"" (as in, to gouge something with a fork). It is positively painful. If you read this, presenter, and you helped put this set together, I congratulate you on that work, but PLEASE, sir, I encourage you to practice your reading and presentation some more. Have mercy! I was trying to get away from reading a print book, but you added a whole layer of tedious effort to the listening. Nevertheless, I have a need and a want for this content, so I think it was worth it.",1367971200,,1439,4.752
