2456087,5,B000CCBCA8,These Muppet Movies just never age! They are fantastic and now my 2 boys love the Muppet Show and The Muppet Movies. Fantastic memories.,1278201600,,136,4.708333333333333
2456088,5,B000CCBCA8,We watched all 3 movies coming home on a long drive. Very fun! The whole family love the muppets! These movies were inexpensive.,1264032000,,128,4.608695652173913
2456089,4,B000CCBCA8,Thanks so much.  This video is just what I was searching for for my daughter. Sometimes these older videos are hard to buy local and one of the videos in the set was what she was asking for and the others are a bonus.,1239667200,,217,3.9318181818181817
2456090,5,B000CCBCA8,"I got this box set for my 5year old daughter, she loved the movies and I loved the price. She gets to enjoy the movies I grew up watching.",1239062400,,138,3.793103448275862
2456091,5,B000CCBCA8,The Muppets are some some of the only movies out there suitable for toddlers.  Not a lot of scary stuff (like Disney animated movies).  Muppets from Space is the best.,1229990400,6,167,4.533333333333333
2456092,3,B000CCBCA8,"This boxed set is alright but it is not worth some of the other ones that are on the market.

The only movie that is worth the price that is being asked is The Muppets Take Manhattan because it is the only one of the three movies that has Jim Henson's personal mark on it. In that particular movie the muppets are a group of college kids who decide that they want to be on broadway and not only that they want to be famous as stage actors (a little on the hilarious side because Henson always wanted to be in film and he wanted to be famous in film.) They move to Manhattan which is the epicenter of stage acting in the United States. But they find that their path is a little harder then expected and end up with no money in a city where everything costs five times what they need. At some point during the adventure Kermit loses his memory and ends up with a bunch of boring high class frogs. Filled with the trade-marks of the muppets this film is silly and full of the jokes and wonderful story-telling that made Sesame Street a household show.

Muppets From Space is funny but it is not an original Henson project. In it Gonzo is lonely and wishes that he knew more about what he is. He keeps having dreams about what he is and causes a media circus around the other muppets. The performer who originated the Gonzo character is still taking on this role and that is what makes this movie worth having, but it does not have the same charm as the original muppet ventures and the buyer would be better served waiting on this product and seeing if they can get it for less in a separate sale.

Kermit's Swamp Years isn't very interesting, I can't even remember what the story is about and there is less time between when I watched that movie and wrote this review then the others. It focuses on Kermit which was the first mistake and tries to retell his origin story (which was done in the Muppet Movie which was written and produced before Henson died of a staff infection.) Don't buy this particular movie unless you find it really cheap or see it first (you can probably find it at the local library.)

My copy of Muppets Take Manhattan came from Wal-Mart for five dollars. Muppets From Space has gone on sell occasionally and if you want to spend a lot of money on a boxed set you would better be served by buying something that is much harder to get, like the Storyteller series which is absolutely brilliant and even the most stubborn children will find this film charming. Save your money for something you actually want and see if buying these things individually is not a more cost effective answer to your desires.",1228262400,16,2626,4.3640081799591
2456093,2,B000CCBCA8,"What is up with ""Kermit's Swamp Years""?!!  Why not, ""The Muppet Movie"" or ""The Great Muppet Caper"" with the other two movies?  Who cares about ""Kermit's Swamp Years""? They can only get you to buy this lousy movie by putting it in with the other two.  They couldn't sell it by itself.  This 3 pack should be at least $5.00 cheaper because of ""swamp years"".",1178582400,4,355,4.415384615384616

2456125,4,B000CCBCA8,"The Muppets take Manhattan is of course a wonderful classic, and Muppets from Space is a favorite from my childhood to be sure. Not sure what ""Kermit's Swamp Years"" is doing in this collection, as it's obviously an inferior movie in every way to the other two... a straight-to-DVD children's movie fit for maybe 5-year-olds, but not for the whole family the way the rest are. It had cute moments (and child kermit is adorable), but overall the script was poorly done and the laughs were few and far between. Also, the dog puppet was really ugly and weird compared to the real dog...

Price is okay for the good two movies, but adding a sub-standard movie in there doesn't make it a bargain.",1373846400,,690,4.564516129032258
