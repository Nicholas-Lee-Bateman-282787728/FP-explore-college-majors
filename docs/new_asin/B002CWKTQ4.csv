8364531,3,B002CWKTQ4,"Artwork is good. Story isn't really there though. It really comes down to it's too much for a movie. Mystery stranger possibly from another world, don't have time to flesh that out so he will just wander in and out mysteriously. Beautiful woman running darkside of Tokyo, no time for that she will just claim to run everything while not accomplishing anything. Evil organization trying to control the world (why? that's just what they do) and kill everybody(why? again, just what they do), is sending deadly assassins to kill a rebel. The assassins come with extreme abilities some are enhanced humans(not explained) and others have psycic or magical powers(again not explained). Lone surviving rebel of a group that tried to take down this evil corp.,his group is unexplained, reasons untold, he is there to bring the characters together for a common goal, and we've run out of time ending the struggle continues. Feel satisfied? I don't.",1514160000,,939,5.0256410256410255

8364533,5,B002CWKTQ4,"Not a fast paced movie, and the plot is REALLY overflooded with characters, but damn the soundtrack is incredible, the animation is pretty good. The three main reasons you watch this film, however, are for it's superb atmosphere, Kikuchi's crazy imagination and it's cool as f*** ""main character"" Darkside. I put main character in quotes because he isn't in the film nearly as much as he should be. He looks cool (a lot like D from Kikuchi's VHD), has some amazing powers but he doesn't have enough to do. English dub is pretty decent, and compared to other CPM dubs it's a masterpiece (compare this to MD Geist and Demon City Shinjuku)
The main problem is how many characters there are. Considering mow many there are, the film does an impressive job making them all likeable. The main complaint is how it's story ends, which while it does wrap up the current narrative opens it up for so much more. Kikuchi explains in the manga's translation that he hope it's successful enough in the US to get a sequel, because it wasn't in Japan. You can tell Kikuchi probably had a ton of plot and lore planned out for DSBlues the way VHD, Wicked City and Demon City Shinjuku span tons of novels, but it wasn't financially successful enough to warrant a bigger franchise. Shame really, cus I imagine sequels would include Darkside more, and Darkside is easily one of Kikuchi's best characters from his coolness alone. And sequels would fix the film's main problem- the story doesn't really go much anywhere, and there are too many things that go unexplained.

All in all, amazing for fan's of Kikuchi's crazy ideas, fans of atmospheric animation and fans of soundtracks. All the characters that are here are likeable, especially Mai, but there is some fat you could trim from the picture. It follows the manga really closely, which is good, but unlike Crying Freeman they didn't make changes that adapted the plot better to screen. Still, great style, smooth pacing, some very likeable characters, amazing soundtrack, great atmosphere, a lot of creativity and one of the coolest main characters of all time make DSBlues an underrated film. It's truly great, standing with Vampire Hunter D(original) and Wicked City.
Still hard to recommend, however. There are those who will love it and those who will hate it.",1492992000,,2300,4.822784810126582

8364539,5,B002CWKTQ4,"Darkside Blues....ah man...it's awesome to get this after I saw it when it was on TV so many years ago. He is smooth and there are no sequels of this film, which is disappointing because this old school anime is so cool! Just like any old-school anime that is almost unheard of and probably hard to find, it's going to be awesome and great to share with other fans who missed the old days of good detailed, graphic art of Japanese animation. This is a must buy!",1395273600,2,461,4.310344827586207
8364540,3,B002CWKTQ4,"Beware for Darkside is coming to Earth. No I am not talking about the DC comic super villain who terrorizes the heroes of the DC universe. I am talking about the unnamed dark clad man who comes through a dimensional portal on a horse drawn carriage arriving in Kabuki-cho ""The Dark Side of Tokyo"" which is one of the last places on Earth that isn't controlled by the Persona Century Corporation. This mysterious Darkside brings a coming change and renewal to poor and disenfranchised people of Kabuki-cho, as well as the power hungry rulers of Earth that run Persona Century, and the rest of the citizens of Earth.

I had originally watched Darkside Blues around fifteen years ago, and at the time I really enjoyed the film, but after seeing the film again after such a long time I realize that while Darkside Blues is an entertaining film with some grand ideas it is also a very flawed anime film as well. The film follows a whole cast of characters from wayward rebels living in Kabuki-cho to members of the anti-Persona group to Persona representatives. There are so many plot threads, genres and themes taking place in a miniscule running time of eighty three minutes that it takes away from the quality of the film. There is the plot thread revolving around Darkside and the Persona Corporation. Apparently the Persona Corporation sealed Darkside in another dimension, but the film never tries to explain the reasoning behind it only implying that the return of Darkside will be extremely bad for Persona. I found the plot and the character Darkside interesting and wished the film could have explored that plot thread better. There is another plot thread that revolves around Mai and her past dealing with the Guren the heir to the Persona Corporation, and there are many more plot points, and plot twists in Darkside that might have worked better if Darkside had been a longer film or had a thirteen episode anime series.

There were obvious messages that writer Kikuchi Hideyuki and director Yoshimichi Furukawa wanted to convey in their film as ""renewal"" or ""rebirth"" in overcoming loss, rape, or some other kind of hardship and being reborn. There are many religious undertones to the film and other themes about peace, like whether world peace can be achieved peacefully or must it be achieved by force and ruled by a dictator, and if that is achieved is that truly peace. There are many interesting themes that could have explored better if the film had been longer or had Darkside Blues been turned into a short series. You can see the running theme I am going with as I continue my review. The other problem with the film is the all the different genres being blended together. Darkside Blues is a Dystopian film that blends fantasy, action, science fiction, drama, suspense and romance to name a few, and at certain points in the in Darkside it did work well, but you know where I am going with this so I'll stop here.

While the plot, characters, themes weren't fleshed out enough one of the things that did work for the film was the tone of Darkside Blues. The anime film was dark in color to emphasize the themes of the film and it works really well. Even when it is daylight you can still see the shadows of the darkness and it just emphasizes the points the writer and director are trying to convey. While I am sure the animation was good nearly twenty years ago when the film came out Darkside's animation certainly does not hold up as well as other anime films, but is still decent and enjoyable. Now to what is perhaps the best part of the film which is the music scored by Kazuhiko Toyama. The music is beautifully scored and fleshed out fully encompassing each scene in the film. Then there was the ant-persona ballad song. I don't know who sang the song, but it was wonderfully written and exquisitely performed by the singer with a simple guitar. I tried to looking online to find who sang both the Japanese and English words for the song, but I could not find out who performed the ballads.

I truly believe Darkside Blues could have worked extremely better as an anime series. The plot, characters and themes could have been completely fleshed out in a twelve or twenty four episode series. Unfortunately instead we get a jumbled mess that is at times an entertaining film in Darkside Blues that blends to many plot threads, themes, genres and characters into a short film that. I give Kikuchi Hideyuki and Yoshimichi Furukawa props for trying to create a meaningful film, but they have sadly failed and I can't recommend Darkside unless you are a true anime fan then you might find the film worthwhile or entertaining like I did.",1375660800,4,4659,4.684981684981685
