8119742,4,B000FABD38,"If you're looking for a travel log style DVD about the island of Hawaii, this is not the one for you. This DVD  is more like taking a vacation trip with your family. It's like arriving at your hotel and visiting touristy spots, home movie style. Entertaining.
You could find some ideas for your first trip by watching the DVD, if you are not much of  a vacationer or traveler and plan to visit the island of Hawaii.",1434412800,,415,4.3076923076923075
8119743,1,B000FABD38,"this was so bad it made me laugh. it's a 40 minute family movie. and a badly made one at that. it's really a home movie, with no talking, and spliced together pictures of Chinese people afraid to go near the water. how did this even get distributed and sold? If you pay for than fifty cents for this you're a fool!! Seriously. No talking throughout, and you can even watch the film as a series of slides. LOL! So funny. A bunch of Chinese people on vacay and someone taking bad family video of it. I don't get this at all. Watch a Rick Steves video or a travel video of Hawaii and not this junk.",1385164800,,595,4.094017094017094
8119744,3,B000FABD38,Video was dissapointing in the complete lack of any narration or dialogue at all. It is simply a video of one families vacation to the big island with some music dubbed on as a background. Videography is decent. I give them credit for coming up with a way to help pay for their trip. It simply comes across as a home video.,1270598400,,323,4.225806451612903
8119745,3,B000FABD38,"While the one review states that 'A Trip to Hawaii's Big Island' is nothing more than a family vacation  put to video with repeating music, I must say I enjoyed it.  I found it to be refreshing knowing that I was viewing a time of relaxation and enjoyment with the Thompson family and their trip to the big island.  It is so easy to get sucked into promotional videos and tourist type activities only meant to make money for the tourist businesses.  Being from Colorado and being snowed in for the fourth straight week of frigid cold, I found this video making me desire a trip to Hawaii.",1168905600,,588,4.416666666666667
8119746,1,B000FABD38,"This was a total waste of money! Please don't be fooled about this being a good Hawaiian DVD! This was filmed by someone with only amateur filming experience. The music is repeated, the camera is shaky, and the subjects are boring! This is nothing more than a family trip put on a DVD with a fancy cover. It was painful to watch. Would make a great gag gift if you want to blow twenty bucks!",1167436800,2,391,4.226666666666667
8119747,5,B000FABD38,"A great travel video, detailing the various things to do on Hawaii that aren't club or hotel related.  A sort of ""behind the scenes"" idea of what Hawaii has to offer in the realm of nature and beauty.  A fun video!!",1146355200,,215,4.219512195121951
8119748,4,B000FABD38,This documentary provided excellent footage of the big island of Hawaii.  It really gives the viewer a sense of being on location in Hawaii. The scenery was breathtaking.  The music was set perfectly to the movement of the video.  A must-see for anyone wishing to visit Hawaii.,1144454400,,277,4.851063829787234
