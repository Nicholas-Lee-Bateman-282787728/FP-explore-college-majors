2663111,5,B000IQUGE6,"Just saw the PBS presentation tonight and was mesmerized by the entire show.  Fabulous, and worthy of all the grandeur deserving to Lawrence Welk. His musical family is amazing. They are all the same as when he was present with them.  All seem to have been inspired by his wholesome ideals. It was genuinely heartwarming to watch them all, knowing he was their inspiration and would be so proud of them all. How Great Thou Art, Amazing Grace, Ave Maria.....all my favorites and many more.",1338595200,15,488,4.729411764705882

2663124,2,B000IQUGE6,"My 93 year old mother and I were both disappointed in this Lawrence Welk DVD.  They sang beautiful gospel music, but it just wasn't the peppy entertainment that ""To America With Love"" or ""Milestones & Memories"" had - almost a little sad.",1431561600,2,237,4.642857142857143

2663127,3,B000IQUGE6,"I ordered this DVD thinking it would be a compilation of old Lawrence Welk show excerpts, snippets. Instead, this was a tribute to him from Branson, Missouri, long after he passed away. Many of the original's show singers were there, singing mostly religious songs. I liked better the PBS specials that appear during fund raising drives, where you see an assortment of the best of the LW show. The picture quality was very good, the content was not what I expected, since the advertising does not say what this DVD contains. ""Precious Memories"" is too vague of a title to be used as a description.",1427155200,9,597,4.695238095238095
