4310917,5,B004AR4W4O,"""The Stonewall Uprising"" is a very educational, powerful documentary. I was impressed with the archival footage, still photographs and interviews with just a few of the people who were there the night that GLBTQ people finally refused to be bullied by police and ""the establishment."" Up until the Stonewall Uprising on June 28, 1969, gays, lesbians, bisexual, transgender people and those questioning their sexuality were routinely subjected to humiliating, brutal punishments for simply being ""caught"" in a gay bar--they were arrested as the bar was raided and their names and addresses were published in local newspapers! They were frequently ruined for life; they often lost their jobs as a result of being arrested for ""homosexual (and other) acts"" because the papers made it very public that they had committed what was then just about the most horrible, shameful and indecent crime you could commit. Indeed, it's chilling to see footage of a law enforcement officer barking at a group of young students that if they were involved in any same-sex activity or similar relationships they ""would find out about it and you'll be caught--we'll tell your parents"" and more! Those poor students looked scared to death. There was even a ""Dachau for queers"" called The Atascadero State Hospital in California where staff injected ""sexual deviants"" with a drug designed to make them feel they were drowning in an effort to ""cure them.""

Some of the most poignant footage is the interviews we get with several people who were actually at The Stonewall Bar that evening--they tell how the Mafia routinely ran the gay bars and paid off the cops to either stay away or raid the bars at pre-arranged times. These eye-witnesses also tell of just how big the crowd of angry people became after The Stonewall was raided unexpectedly and how violence broke out--this was the first time police had ever seen this reaction from the gays, lesbians, drag queens and others on their side. We find out what happened after more police arrived; the complete story of what transpired that evening is fascinating. We learn in great detail how the GLBTQ community resisted police all through that night. There is even interview time with a police office who was there the night the bar was raided.

The DVD doesn't come with bonus features; but then again it doesn't have to. The story is told with such clarity and detail that almost nothing, if anything, is left out.

Overall, I highly recommend this film for anyone in the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and questioning community; and it's clearly essential viewing for anyone studying the history of human rights and civil rights. We must remember The Stonewall Uprising so that younger generations of people will know about the birth of what was to become the global GLBTQ equal rights movement.",1334016000,2,2831,5.019148936170213
4310918,5,B004AR4W4O,This informative video about the gay movement in the late 60's should be in every educated person's shelf. I am glad I was able to find it here.,1326758400,,144,4.178571428571429
4310919,5,B004AR4W4O,"This retrospective of what New York-ers call ""Stonewall"" is informative and uplifting.  The story of those involved, police and civilians, gives you a truer perspective of what happened and how it still affects us today.",1318464000,2,220,5.285714285714286
4310920,5,B004AR4W4O,"Just finished watching this excellent film and I was really pleased with it. By using people that were actually there and letting them speak about their experiences, it really helped me to ""feel"" what it was like to have been there myself. Even though I had not been born yet.

Most enlightening was to actually have an NYPD cop tell the story from his experience and what was going on when the police took refuge in the Stonewall Inn itself to protect themselves from the angry crowds!

This is a movie that needs to be shown everywhere and anywhere that intolerance and anti-gay bigotry exists.

GAY POWER!",1312070400,3,608,4.663551401869159
4310921,5,B004AR4W4O,"This movie is excellent and does a great job covering the beginning of the gay rights movement. It is a movie that shows a part of history that is not normally provided to the public. I recommend it for everyone.
I lived in NYC a few years after this all took place, and I loved seeing some of my old stomping grounds!",1309996800,3,318,4.145161290322581

4310923,5,B004AR4W4O,"As other reviewers have said STONEWALL UPRISING almost as valuable for what it tells you about  pre-Stonewall attitudes to homosexuality as what it tells you about Stonewall itself.

Especially the Dade County, Fla. (yeah that place again) lecture to school kids
[.]

and the clip about Atascadero State Hospital in California -- ""the Dachau for queers"".

You could argue that it neglects thriving subcultures in many urban centres (read George Chauncey's book, Gay New York). But there is only so much a single documentary can do.

For those who felt that STONEWALL UPRISING shortchanges the role of transvestites -  have a look at SCREAMING QUEENS : THE RIOT AT COMPTON'S CAFETERIA. Which happened 3 years before Stonewall - in 1966 and was in some ways more radical if more local and less famous in its consequences.

Both documentaries leave you inspired and wanting to know more.",1306627200,19,890,5.01360544217687
4310924,5,B004AR4W4O,"The Stonewall uprising took place in 1969 in Greenwich Village. It was a surprise for all parties concerned, the police, who never expected the gay community to fight back, and for the men and women who finally were fed up with their treatment.

This documentary presents film clips of the time, such as one that warned of the 'dangers of ruining all chance at a normal life'. There are recollections and films that point out...' notice how Albert delicately pats his hair and adjusts his collar, his movements are not those of a real boy'. This does an outstanding job of letting viewers know what the mood of the era was concerning homosexuality.

The social life of New York is described and shown in videos of the day, including news reels of the Stonewall uprising itself. Participants, police and observers are able to present their views.
This is a part of history, no matter what your opinions are and should also be viewed as a part of the movement of individuals trying to gain the right to how they believe they should be treated.
The DVD does contain English subtitles surround sound and scene selection.",1304985600,28,1116,4.717948717948718
4310925,5,B004AR4W4O,"With the recent commercial success of Milk, the mainstreaming of gay culture, and the remarkable strides made with regard to gay rights, gay marriage, and gay adoption - it shouldn't surprise me that this film has come along. What surprised me after just finishing it, however, is that it took so long for this story to be made.

Very well produced (part of the exceptional PBS 'American Experience' series), these guys do a Ken Burns quality job, interviewing at least 10 people who were there during this historic time for gay civil rights in the US. Using archival footage and expert writing, the story is compelling as both a human story of struggle as well as a historical representation of a period of intense social change in 1960's New York City.

Very eye opening as a primer for our community, this documentary should be required viewing by every gay person - and highly recommended for anyone interested in marginalized communities' struggle for equality and civil rights.",1304121600,24,983,4.9156626506024095

4310943,5,B004AR4W4O,"As usual, American Experience presents an in-depth and interesting perspective on Stonewall.  They were able to get many of the folks who were there during the Stonewall event to describe their experiences that night.  It also gives you a good background on what gay individual went through before this seminal event.  I highly recommend it for those that are interested in this seminal historical event!",1401926400,,404,5.184615384615385
4310944,5,B004AR4W4O,"An excellent documentary using historical pictures and film and some recreation; includes interviews with participants.

The DVD was in excellent condition and arrived before the promised date.",1397520000,,372,5.216666666666667
4310945,5,B004AR4W4O,"I recently loaned this dvd to a young queer who told me they had no idea that homosexuality was illegal in the United States until 1969. This young person is 22 years old.  Needless to say, the documentation of queer history is sorely lacking. Fortunately the American Experience, which always delivers perfect, entertaining yet respectable productions of historical American time capsules, has approached this subject/story of when gay men and women in America stood up to the police (and the mafia) and said ""No more"".  This production delivers the story of how the current Gay Rights Movement erupted in New York City in 1969.

You get much more than just the Stonewall Inn story.  You get a development of the story of a certain treatment of a certain group of people only rivaled by the horrific trials suffered by the Jews during the holocaust. That may sound dramatic to some, but if you objectively step back and look at the entire history of the treatment of homosexuals in human history, you'll agree that the methodic efforts to obliterate this sector of society has been continuous and is still alive today.

This documentary belongs in every library interested in human history. Not just just gay history.",1395360000,,1218,4.921951219512195
4310956,5,B004AR4W4O,What does one say about such an event?  These people who's disarstardly crime is to love another person just get pushed to far.

4310957,1,B004AR4W4O,"Another PBS historical recreation  with a warm fuzzy ending masquerading as a documentary.  OK, the first third or so of the film was a good recap of the larger historical context the LGBTQ people faced in the 19590s and 1960s, but when it gets to actually focusing on the Stonewall events and after it becomes  a very problematic movie. 1) There was actually very little visual  record of events at  Stonewall. All of the film footage and photos were lifted from stock footage of other protests, etc. Yes, they note that in an on-screen statement but you got to watch fast for it. 2) The sequence at the end where a women being interviewed said she proposed at protest meeting right after Stonewall that they have a march and all the hands in the room went upwell the March they then show  happened a year  later (again  the date noted in  quick subtitle). It was a  march different  than the one  the woman in the earlier scene was talking about. These are just two of the  problems  in the historical record. One could only guess how many more there are.

The film, like most of PBSs documentaries, is good at celebratory mythmaking, but  lousy about respecting the historical record.  It reveals more about where we are at now  than what actually happened back then.",1390867200,7,1270,4.59375

It is very meaningful especially now as the U.S. Supreme Court considers two marriage equality cases.  This film really shows us how far we really have come!",1364342400,,453,4.172413793103448

4310964,5,B004AR4W4O,"Conducting then-usual raids on then-mafia-run gay bars, including the Stonewall Inn, the New York City Police Department was surprised when the patrons instead began fighting back. Days of rioting followed.

The demand just to drink at a bar in peace is very 'moderate' in our era. Major cities now have GLBT elected officials and there is a push for equal benefits. The Democratic Party endorses same sex marriage in it's platform.

But these people merely wanted the right to congregate. They initially weren't thinking about public office or being 'out' in the public sphere. They just did not want to be arrested for who they were!

This was a different era when the American Psychological Association still classified homosexuality as a mental illness--a disorder it did not remove until 1973. An arrest record and the public reporting of this brought public shame and the loss of employment, even in a place like New York.
Pressure from subsequent activists in the Gay Liberation Front, who were dissatisfied with the pace of change, helped soon move beyond initial demands.

The documentary is good because it relies upon both stock footage and first person interviews. You understand how this transformed and successfully politicized a community. They realized that they had 'rights' and were citizens.  There was no going back to how 'others' said they should be.

And perhaps most importantly, gay rights is an issue still very much discussed in the public sphere. History is not just something which happens in the past--but an ongoing process developed every day. Ordinary people who are upset with their conditions then work together to create the change which they desire.

Airing lesser known documentaries like this would get more people involved in their communities and engaged with American history. It also explains why there is a 'pride parade' every June!",1347148800,,1877,5.154605263157895
4310965,5,B004AR4W4O,"On the night of June 28th, 1969, queer folk, men, women, drag queens, came out fighting from the dark of night.  The following dawn, an identity and a movement were born.  No longer pathology cases or `tea-room` deviants, the `twilight people` were baptized `gay` and the rest is history.

`Stonewall Uprising` documents the events that led up to the explosion outside Greenwich Village`s Stonewall Inn that torrid summer night.  With unjust sex laws that criminalized homosexual behavior, 1960`s America was a dark time for gay people.  Persecuted, subjected to lobotomies and electro-shock therapy, queer folk were hunted at every turn.  The sole refuge was the gay bar.  Tucked away on seedy alleys, they served a variety of functions for gay people.  They were social clubs, counseling centers, fortresses where queer men and women could feel some sense of security.  Yet, vice squads routinely entered such establishments and arrested the occupants on so-called `public indecency` charges.  Police entrapment and bullying was endemic throughout American cities.  Any gay person loitering anywhere could be picked up and arrested.  All this changed with the courageous men and women who finally stood up on June 28th, 1969 and said enough is enough.

A smart, well-crafted documentary, `Stonewall Uprising` tells the stories of various participants of that fateful night, from the fierce drag queens to the terrified police officers trapped within the Stonewall Inn by the enraged crowd.

The first half of the film presents the dismal, fear-filled lives of many pre-Stonewall gays.  Police footage of `tea-room` arrests are shown alongside such well-meaning, but grotesque documentary clips that put a human face on the clinical moniker of `homosexual.`

The second half of `Stonewall Uprising` concentrates on the riots themselves and the on the events that precipitated them, namely the creation of America`s first gay ghetto, Greenwich Village.  Following the riots and the brutal police response, the Village`s gay community rose up and held the first-ever `gay pride` demonstration march through the streets of New York.

`Stonewall Uprising` has given voice to a community whose history has languished in silence for too long.  For us queer folk, the struggle for equity was born with the Stonewall Uprising and remains unfinished.  Those concerned about the civil equality of all Americans would do well to watch this documentary.",1334188800,4,2442,5.3931398416886545

8420732,5,B004AR4W4O,This was an excellent film on the Stonewall uprising. It showed the true event s and it was very helpful to orient historically with what really went on. Many today want to change things to reflect the politically correct idea and incorporate it into the history of the LGBT history. This film does not pull any punches as to what happened and that it was mostly young kids with a few drag queens who started the whole process of LGBT coming out into the open. I think that if we who are LGBT are going to continue to be a part of what this society is than we need to hear the truth regardless of what we may think. I know that I like this type of historical film that does tell the truth and gives us the groundwork that went into who we are as a community.
