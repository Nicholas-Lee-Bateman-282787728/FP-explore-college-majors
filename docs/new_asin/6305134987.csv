970991,4,6305134987,"Paul Morrissey was Andy Warhol's resident in house filmmaker and prime mover on his non art related activities, as The Vevet Underground's John Cale said ""Paul was the muscle-he made things happen.."" His films were the most successful to appear under the Warhol moniker and launched Joe Dellasandro as an international sex symbol and pop culture icon.

The doco 'Factory Days' is a fascinating look back at Morrissey's time with Warhol. It's full of never before seen photo's and entertaining anecdotes and info. Much has been said of the filmmakers bitterness and distancing of himself from Warhol over the years, and it's hinted at in the by the cumugeonly New Yorker's narration,  But it's still a must see for Warhol fans.",1181001600,5,726,4.991735537190083
970992,5,6305134987,For a fan of the Factory-era works of the artists of the Warhol Underground this is a great item.  The movies all speak for themselves and to Paul Morrissey's avant-garde(for its time) film-making.  They also speak to Joe Dallesandro's talent for getting points across with little dialogue and mostly action.,1178928000,2,308,5.14

970994,1,6305134987,"Perhaps I should have done some research before I bought the 4 disc set, but I was surprised to find these to be so disappointing. I had read Holly Woodlawn's book, ""A Low Life in High Heels"", and thought I would get more of a feel for all of the book's hype about Paul Morrissey and Andy Warhol and the movies they made. I just didn't know what I was getting. I wasn't misled by anyone. I suppose if you are a cult fan of PM & AW, you should have these for your collection. I'll make you a really good deal.",1173312000,4,508,3.9901960784313726
970995,4,6305134987,Joe Delesandro is great in this Andy Warhol movie. I watch it over and over. Not your ordinary theater movie.,1142294400,3,109,4.5
970996,5,6305134987,"Some reviewers are clearly unaware of the backstory to this film.  Andy Warhol only participated in this film and those produced after it has Producer.  Warhol only was only involved with the stars who were close friends, such as Candy Darling.  Of course it is very easy to understand why; this film was shot only weeks after Andy was nearly murdered by SCUM founder Valerie Solanas (Salonas only starred in one of the infamous Audition reels, and had a brief role in I, a Man so I don't think she's deserving of the title Star).  The closest that Andy ever came to directing after the incident was fueling the tension between his three Beauty Queens in Women in Revolt over the phone.

But making Joe a Street Hustler was Andy's idea.  Andy was greatly dissapointed that the film Midnight Cowboy became so successful, he felt that it stole its plot from his film My Hustler starring Paul America.  Joes original profession in this film was a Boxer, but Andy remembered hearing Joe talk about his days working the streets and asked Morrissey to make the change.

The Plot Synopsis that Amazon has given is inaccurate, Joe and his Wife are not Junkies.  The real reason he is trying to earn money that day is to pay for his Wifes lovers abortion.  You following me?

Flesh is best remembered for pushing the boundaries of male full-frontal nudity, but it has a great story to.  The most obvious problem that I think people will encounter is the in-camera editing.  This editing style gives a flash effect that does become a bit annoying, but it was done by Morrissey to reming the audience that they are only watching a film and probably to make them annoyed because you end up missing entire conversations. Also there are entire sequences done with no dialogue, and there is really no musical soundtrack to accompany the film.

My favorite part of the film is the characters who Joe encounters.  This includes a hilarious artist with the habit of talking to himself, whom Joe models for, Joe's ex-girlfriend, a topless dancer, and her friends (one is a drag queen and the other is a pre-op in real life, but this isn't stated in the film), and Joe's friend, the dialogue hints a lover or regular customer, who was badly burned by a flamethrower.

In the end, I do believe that this film was made for a certain crowd.  But it's not necessarily a ""gay"" film, and it's not just a nudity fest; there is a real and touching story to the film.  For example, there is a very moving sequence where Joe is feeding his young daughter, it's moments like these that make the Warhol/Morrissey Films so great.",1135987200,30,2596,4.606521739130435
970997,3,6305134987,"........This is not a great film. It's interesting, however, and I'm not sorry I ordered this DVD. As a New Yorker, it is always interesting to see the Big Apple back in the '70s or '60s. Seeing Joe walk up streets that I know so well makes this picture mean more to me. I've seen the hustlers of 42nd Street and hookers jumping in and out of cars, I've seen the sleaze of the City. That life-style was never fascinating to me. The sexual part was, but the lurid, impersonal part was not. After reading John Reichy's ""City of Night,"" I was prepared to move from the midwest to Gotham with a wealth of knowlege. Believe me, as a young, attractive novice, I encountered much of what was in that book!
Joe Dallesandro, with some acting lessons with Stella Adler or Uta Hagen might have made an exceptional actor. Many of the people who reviewed him, I think, were dazzled by his beauty and his incredible, natural body (he sports an incredible bush of pubic hair). How refreshing that is considering all the shaving of private parts these days! Any woman or man who looks at Joe cannot help but look at him without having the SAME admiration for him as they do for the au natural statue for Michelangelo's David. I remember when my body was similar to that!
I don't recommend this picture for the ""art"" of it, but if you want to appreciate a modern depiction of the perfection of the male human form...Dallesandro is your model.",1025136000,20,1425,4.484615384615385
970998,4,6305134987,"We are at the end of the hippy revolution. Andy Warhol explores the body-pride of the young males. This new feeling finds its roots in the cult of the body, of physical strength and muscular building. We are before body-building but after Woodstock where the body was religiously considered as the mark of God on us. This body-pride is taken to the extreme of believing that a man has to live for his body but also by his body. His body is the only riches he naturally has and he must live from it. So he exploits his body and by doing so exploits the fantasms of other men and women, the fantasm that a beautiful body has to be worshipped and the body-pride can be without any guilt transmuted into sex. The main character exploits this vein and makes a comfortable living out of it. But Warhol goes one step further and transforms the nudity of the male body into something banal and in no way provocative. It is a beauty to be looked at and not to be ashamed of. He even gives a rare scene where the nude father plays with and feeds his little baby. That was a real revolution in those days. The father was more than a man. He was a father and as such could take care of the baby he had born to life, just as much as the mother. The film hence gives some very precious scenes on this cult of the male body as a source of beauty and pleasure. It is the total lack of shame and modesty that makes this nudity, complete or in the process of revealing itself by undressing, something normal, unshocking and revealing in us some kind of purity by the capability to look at it without being in anyway roused to some kind of carnal desire.  We are not queers  as one character says, just proud of our well trained and sculpted bodies.

971121,3,6305134987,"A military brat who rasn wild, Joe Dallesandro did a number of nude modeling jobs for ""physique"" magazines before he stumbled into Andy Warhol about 1967.  Whatever Warhol's gifts, he did have a talent for surrounding himself with extreme personalities, and for the next few years Dallesandro would be one of them, a fixture at Warhol's ""factory"" and a player in one Warhol-produced movie after another.

At least eight such films would be directed, written, and edited by the remarkably untaltented Paul Morrissey, who would basically come on the set and have the actors riff on whatever came to mind.  As for acting there is none in any real sense; the performers are not artists and are vaguely interesting only because they themselves are so extreme.  Dallesandro was not an actor, but he had a great body and tremendous sexual sizzle, and both are on significant display in FLESH, which is the very loosely told story of a male prostitute (Dallesandro) who is working to raise money for his wife's girlfriend's abortion.  Other players include such Warhol characters as drag queens Jackie Curtis and Candy Darling and stripper Geri Miller.

Now, there's really only one reason to watch one these Warhol-Morrissey-Dallessandro flicks, and that is the hope that Dallesandro will get naked.  Where FLESH is concerned, he does--but with a difference.  In later films Dallesandro would acquire a rougher look and harder, dismissive personality; very often it was clear he was doing what he was doing for the money and nothing more.  But in FLESH he is actually fresh, has a certain innocence, and actually seems to be enjoying himself.  It makes for a lot of difference between this film and, say, the slightly later HEAT.

None of this is to say that FLESH is actually enjoyable as a motion picture.  At the time the male nudity was startling, enough to make Dallesandro an American and European sex symbol for more than a decade, but beyond this FLESH is as ho-hum as other film that Warhol produced and Morrissey directed, and you will probably hit the fast-forward time and time again.  Even so, given the fact that Dallesandro doesn't seem quite as rough here as he later became, this may well be the best of the lot.  Recommended for his fans, but unless you happen to be into Dallesandro or want to see what all the 1960s ""Warhol underground movie"" fuss was about, you should probably give it a miss.

971125,2,6305134987,"What a difference 40 years makes. I suppose we all thought we were too too hip when we saw this film in 1968. After all Joe Dallesamndro was all of 20 with a perfect body that he keeps showing in this film. It must have been a first with all that frontal nudity although he does seem quite natural when he strips for us. I'll give him that. But unfortunately this movie doesn't hold up at all. One of the characters, when commenting on school, says ""it's boring,"" a perfect statement about this film that lasts 89 minutes although it seems much longer. It took me three trys and a couple of naps before I finally finished it.

There essentially is no plot, the camera jerks and jerks and the characters mumble. Some of my favorite lines are so bad that they are amusing. ""My brain can't be developed any more than it is now."" ""Do you know what it is like to dance topless before a man who has raped you?"" A tranvestite says  to a real woman: ""I think things that move around like your bust are so beautiful. Let me see what they [breasts] feel like."" Finally when the aging old photorapher/artist queen (Maurice Braddell) rapsodizes on body worship, Dallesandro, who has just posed naked as a discus thrower and now is lying on his stomach, responds ""what's for dinner?""

As we all know, Andy Warhol said that everyone should have 15 minutes of fame. Director Paul Morrissey proves that anyone can make a boring movie.",1222214400,2,1418,4.467181467181467
971126,1,6305134987,"Without wanting to sound like Bob Dylan's Thin Man, I have to say that the movies in this collection are nothing more than anthropological artifacts, amusing in parts, but crude and technically deficient.  The acting, if it qualifies as acting, portrays a gallery of marginalized outcasts in the main, just letting it all hang out for the cameras.  Their performances are stiff and flat, and lacking emotional depth.  You get exhausted watching Joe Dallesandro lounging about in the nick while other characters squabble about their dysfunctional relationships.  It's an aimless meander from one bazaar scene to the next, amid a parade of weird white people, peeling off their clothes at the drop of a hat and indulging in exhibitionism, voyeurism, and trainspotting.  In some respects, it's Jerry Springer without the audience and Jerry, but a little less restrained.

This is a film of the late sixties that was shot with a rather amaturess genere for the reason of the effect it would have on the audience.  Its entire theme surrounds characters in the Big Apple in the era of transition during the late 60s - early 70s.  The director has shown the ultimate conflicts in moral judgements in this country in this film!  His play-off of the characters shows exactly the problems facing society in general.  By tracing this one man's life, we get a small glimse at the chaos that he is living through!

971128,3,6305134987,"Of course the main reason to view this film is Joe Dallesandro. Why else would anyone look at it? It is interesting in a slice-of-life pseudo-documentary way. The same kind of thing you could have seen a few years ago on Primetime Live without the aggravation of Diane Sawyer following Joe around asking him ridiculous questions. The choppy editing and lack of sound in some sections will surely aggravate many or make you wonder if you have missed something. But i mean really, there is not a great intriguing storyline to follow anyway. It is simply a day in the life of one maginificent looking street hustler in the late 60s. It confuses me whether Joe is supposed to be gay, bi, straight, nothing?? But i don't really care because just to train your eyes on him for 90 minutes is enough of a recommendation for anyone really to check out the film. Whether or not it qualifies as ""art"" or not, well that is the debate that can go along with any film. Entertaining? Perhaps. Eyecandy, most def.
