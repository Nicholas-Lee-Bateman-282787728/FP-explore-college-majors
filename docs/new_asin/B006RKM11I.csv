8503597,1,B006RKM11I,"This was very expensive and was a main birthday present for my husband as he collects all the Star Trek series.  The box came in with shrink-wrapped tore, did not look original (even though box said new on outside).  Upon opening the inner seal was torn and all corners crunched.  This was defienetly not new! I ended up repurchasing the set as my husband really like the overall idea and had to wait until the new set arrived.  I paid a little more (about $20) for the second set, but arrived in new condition, so far as promised.

I would not recommend buying from this seller.  They lie and try to cover it up with aftermarket shrink wrap.",1393545600,3,642,4.398305084745763
