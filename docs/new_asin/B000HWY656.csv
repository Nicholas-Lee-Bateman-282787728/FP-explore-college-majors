I liked the direct advice from seasoned professionals and the detailed strategy for investors.  The biggest benefit is the links to foreclosure, pre-foreclosure and ROE websites that typically would cost much more.",1163635200,7,309,5.416666666666667

8141598,4,B000HWY656,"I watched this DVD and found it useful if you are thinking about becoming a real estate investor. The material summarizes things you have to keep in mind if you are planning to start investing in real estate. It covers different points including types of property, morgage options, tenants, what to take into consideration when REI, and even what not to get into. I found the explanation about what to take into consideration when looking for financing and tenants very informative. You will still need to read a lot and research these topics to acquire a working knowledge that should help you be successful. I liked that there were no promises of quick profits but an honest testimonial from people with expertise in their respective areas.
I have some experience in REI and would recommend this DVD for beginner REIs.",1328313600,2,820,4.864285714285714
8141599,1,B000HWY656,"Almost pointless video. The majority of the time they discuss investing down in the keys or Florida, this video was obviously made during the real estate boom in Florida, I can now see why Florida is in so much trouble. Anytime you have ""real estate investors"" like these people you're bound to create problems. No information on multi family.",1234396800,6,343,4.830508474576271
