2653433,5,B000I6O7VY,"Set in the rural outlaw landscape of Uttar Pradesh (state of India), this magnificient adaptation of Othello is entertaining, gripping and memorable. I didn't see it on the big screen when it was released as I don't enjoy the Bollywood stuff dished out like pancakes; but the praise for the film made me buy a VCD of the movie and from the opening scene to the end I was hooked.

All the names of the characters start with the same alphabet as William Shakespeare's characters in Othello. The title role of Omkara has Ajay Devgan as strong leader (bahubali) in a political gang of Bhaisaab played by veteran Naseeruddin Shah. Kareena Kapoor (Dolly / Desdemona) has clearly done her best role to date as the innocent, beautiful and lovely damsel who falls for the warrior Omkara (Othello). She has played urban characters well and has shown that she is talented enough to depict such a drastically different charachter in this brilliant movie by Vishal Bharadwaj (he has made earlier an adaptation of Macbeth - Maqbool).

The main catalyst and best performance in the movie is definitely Saif Ali Khan who is proving himself better and better with each movie he does. He shaved his head and mouths the rural dialect and swear words that wouldn't make any layman believe he is a Nawab heir in real life (Royal descendant). His expression, dialogue delivery, timing, everything is too good to be true. He holds great screen presence and lingers throughout the movie and after in the minds of the characters and audience. His role as Langda Tyagi (Iago) should win him more such serious cinema roles in future.

Vivek Oberoi (Kesu Firangi / Cassio) fits the role of the city boy womaniser now an upstart with initial favour from Omkara (Othello) and then his eagerness to prove his loyalty to Omkara. His love interest in the movie, Billo (Bianca), is played by the hottest star in Hindi Cinema, Bipasha Basu. Though Bipasha has a small role in the movie she will be remembered for it and especially after the great success of the song ""Beedi"" in which she dances at a party with Kesu. She sizzles onscreen and is seductive but falls into the plans laid wickedly by Langda Tyagi as do others.

Other memorable roles are by Konkona Sen as Indu/Emilia, the unwitting accomplice & love of Langda Tyagi. Naseeruddin Shah is authoratative as the Boss who settles scores and gives orders in wise, calm manner.

This is such a great adaptation and it is unfortunate that due to the gangland depiction with abuses, swear words and violence the box office audience stayed away. Internationally it was a hit making the top 10 in UK. Not a film you can watch with family but the tragic love story is a must watch for anyone who thinks Bollywood can't make decent inetrnational standard cinema.

The best memory you will take along from the movie is easily the songs and its picturisation on the characters. Not a single song is distracting from the flow of the movie. I can't get the haunting tune of ""O Saathi Re"" out of my head and ""Naina"" sung by Rahat Ali (son of Nusrat Fateh Ali) is the best love song in years. All music composed by the director, writer - Vishal Bharadwaj is an achievement of great merit. The dance numbers, especially ""Beedi"" is as hot and raw as you can get and enjoy. The music is easily what helped create the great expectations for Omkara. Written by Gulzar all words in all songs are perfectly in tune with the setting, narration and events. Best music album for Bollywood's 2006 is this movie's soundtrack.

For Western viewers it would be great to glimpse this rural lawlessness and the love gone wrong in Indian setting. There is adult language and the passion between Omkara & Dolly, Langda & Indu and Kesu & Billo is somewhat graphic yet expressing the story's progress and theme. Some western newspapers printed the Hindi words in their reviews without knowing that they mean (m*****f***ers and worse). If you can understand the setting and lawlessness presented in this political gang's scenes, you would appreciate the adaptation and presentation of this timeless saga of love, greed, envy and death.

This is for any list of Classic Cinema.",1169337600,7,4165,4.7430939226519335
2653434,4,B000I6O7VY,"As a stand alone movie, I would have given Omkara 3 stars but as an adaptation of Shakespeare's classic - Othello, it deserves 4.  The movie follows Othello perfectly and gives it an Indian touch.

The acting is great.  Ajay Devgan and Kareena Kapoor are likable. Kareena Kapoor otherwise comes off as snobby but in this movie she is effective. Saif Ali Khan plays the villain well.  Bipasha Basu's acting is average - as usual. The soundtrack is average. Bipasha Basu is in two songs and the second song is the only good one in the movie.

This is a serious movie, so if you like comedies you will want to skip this one.  Otherwise, this is better than some Hindi movies I have seen lately.",1166400000,,691,4.444444444444445

2653443,5,B000I6O7VY,"Another excellent Shakespeare adaptation by Bhardwaj, this time moving the story of ""Othello"" to the modern Indian underworld, and making Othello (here called Omkara) not black, but a half-caste.

The acting is all of a very high order -- understated but intense, and even a familiarity with the events of the play didn't keep this from feeling suspenseful, intense and occasionally quite emotional.

If you have the clich vision of a Bollywood film in mind, you're in for a pleasant surprise. The acting is naturalistic, not histrionic (with only one or two exceptions in supporting roles). There is a song or two, but they flow naturally out of the action, in situations where singing is appropriate (e.g. a performance by one of the characters at a party, where others join in).

Note: this is an adaptation of the story, the language is not Shakespeare's. The dialogue is contemporary, and story elements are changed, so this isn't for purists. On the other hand, no familiarity with the original is needed to fully enjoy this complex tale of passion, politics and betrayal. It is alive, and filled with social commentary, romance, and ever evolving alliances. The film also looks great.

I can't comment on the visual quality of this version, but the Eros DVD of this film looks better than the Eagle blu-ray of it's twin Maqbool (Bhardwaj's take on Macbeth).",1399852800,,1364,4.943231441048035

Watch and enjoy Ajay Devgan's Othello and Saif Ali Khan basically stealing the show as Langda his Right hand man. There is an excellent breakdown of the characters and their individual parts on WIKIPEDIA. I highly recommend it. It's my understanding by reviews that it did poorly box office wise because of the supposed foul language. I'm pretty lenient if it's in context and by western standards it was pretty tame stuff in the range of a pg13 rating . Not for the strict folks or those with small kids in the room.

The Othello story is one of Shakespeare's greatest and Bharadwaj does an amazing job translating it into modern, provincial India.
The acting is all stellar, with Ajay Devgan, Vivek Oberoi, and Kareena Kappor being standouts. As others have said this is much more than a Shakespeare retelling, and much more than a gangster movie, and yet it is also great on those levels as well.",1314316800,2,550,4.739583333333333
2653452,5,B000I6O7VY,"I am relatively new to Indian films so, I have to take my friends' word for it that tragedies are still rare, and that that is why the film did not do as well as it could have financially. Great films do not always score well at the box office.

Really, though, what bad things can you say about a film with three leading men each putting in a powerful performance? The story is eternal, but Vishal Bhardwaj's directing and screenwriting was original and fresh, keeping the story clearly Indian while being faithful to Shakespeare's Othello.

As other reviews have pointed out, though, Saif Ali Khan as Langda (Iago from Othello) is a stand-out. Having a handsome leading man shave his head does not hide the charisma in his eyes, but it does give him a harder edge that works well for the spurned best friend come worst enemy.

Instead it transports you to a rural India where violence, politics, relationships and (mis)perceptions blend to create a tragic quadrangle.  It has a brilliant cast, outstanding cinematography and direction and will leave you searching for more.

2653455,4,B000I6O7VY,"Vishal Bhardwaj's Bollywoodized Othello-remake, Omkara, is a strutting, masculine ride through the raunch and jealousies of men, and the havoc these men wreak on the woman who love them. More hypnotic and spacious than his previous Shakespearean joyride, the moody Maqbool, Omkara is set in the 'Wild West of India', the state of Uttar Pradesh. Perhaps Bhardwaj has a fascination with the lawless, but once again Shakespeare has been teleported into a criminal organization. This time, it's the rootin' tootin' gang of Omkara (Ajay Devgan), second banana and chief thug to Boss Bhaisaab (an eerie Naseeruddin Shah).

Omkara has two lieutenants of his own: the grimy and thick Langda (Saif Ali Khan), and the boyish and also thick Kesu (Viveik Oberoi). When Bhaisaab wins a seat in Parliament (shudder at the thought), he nominates Omkara to be official Crime Boss, leaving Omkara then to pick his General. Or Captain. Or whatever, we don't really understand the military metaphors. Anyway, if you know Shakespeare's original, you know that Omkara picks Kesu over Langda, much to Langda's chagrin. Langda then decides that the only way he can ease the pain of rejection is by destroying everything that is beautiful around him. Namely, the illicit love story between ""half-caste"" Omkara and his (presumably full-caste) fiancee, Dolly (Kareena Kapoor).

What follows is a train crash, protracted over nearly three hours. If you know the original, you know what to expect and, inevitably, you sit in grim anticipation as Langda manipulates Omkara's jealousies and creates an imagined world of sweaty adultery. If you've never seen the original, let's just say things don't really work out.

Ajay Devgan is stiff and lumbering as the Othello character. But he does what he's supposed to, which is smolder for two hours, and then briefly weep. Likewise Kareena Kapoor is just Holy and Spotless enough that we feel genuinely sorry for her end, even though we didn't like her throughout the film.

Perhaps the biggest surprise of Omkara is how amazing Saif Ali Khan is as Iago. Iago is generally a difficult character to play; too easily he becomes a caricature of the devil, all cackles and twirling black moustaches and no depth whatsoever. What Saif manages to do, even with the prototypical Shakespearean device of a bad leg, is invest Iago with a sort of sinister depth. Here is a man who hates himself, and, by natural extension, everyone around him. We don't like Saif Ali Khan at all, or thought we didn't, but now... Hmmm. He was certainly the only one, apart from Naseer, who was willing to look positively ugly for the film, what with his yellow teeth and lurching gait. And there's a tragic undercurrent to his behavior, a genuine and justifiable pain at being the loyal servant too-often overlooked.

2653458,5,B000I6O7VY,"As was the case with director Vishal Bhardwaj's first Shakespeare adaptation, 'Maqbool' ('Macbeth'), gushing praise of his version of 'Othello' is also unavoidable. He electrifies this classic tale of insidious jealousy, setting it in mob-infested rural India, a place more like the American Wild West than Elizabethan England. The members of the all-star cast give some of the best performances of their careers. Ajay Devgan smolders as Omkara (Othello), a local gang leader who's deeply insecure about his dark skin. Kareena Kapoor plays Dolly (Desdemona), Omkara's fianc&eacute;, who's as pure of heart as she is fair of face. Saif Ali Khan is the twisted Langda (Iago), who plants seeds of suspicion about Dolly's fidelity in Omkara's mind. Konkona Sen Sharma portrays Indu (Emilia)--Omkara's sister and Langda's wife--as a smart, sassy feminist in an uber-macho world. The role of Kesu (Cassio) belongs to Vivek Oberoi, who's perfectly cast as the college-educated lover boy caught in Langda's web. Bipasha Basu plays Billo (Bianca), a sexy village entertainer and a worldly woman who nonetheless falls for Kesu's Casanova charm. Shakespeare would have been lucky to have had these performers on his stage. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1256601600,7,1446,6.058536585365854
2653459,5,B000I6O7VY,"""Omkara"" was our favorite Hindi film of 2006; it remains one of our favorites, period, from any country in any year. It's a compelling adaptation of Shakespeare's Othello, with standout acting by all involved. ""Omkara"" is gripping from beginning to end as you watch Omkara's suspicion grow, fed by Langda's jealous need for revenge.

Prior to this flick I didn't think Kareena Kapoor could act her way out of a paper bag. I was wrong. Ajay Devgan is as intense as ever, a perfect fit for the brooding paranoia of Othello's character. We see a new side to Saif Ali Khan, shedding his pretty-boy hero image for a tour de force as a truly chilling villain.

A fairly violent flick, don't expect your stereotypical Hindi song &  dance. However, the music is nevertheless superb--by the film's director/screenwriter Vishal Bhardwaj, a triple threat. In addition to being our favorite Hindi film of 2006, ""Omkara"" is widely recognized as also having one of the best soundtracks of any Hindi film that year and makes a great addition to any music library.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Omkara/dp/B000LP5F5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Omkara</a>

Director Vishal is truly talented, made plain by the fact that he can create fine children's films (""Makdee"", ""The Blue Umbrella"") as well as choice adult fare like ""Omkara"" and ""Maqbool"".

One warning: just in case you need a refresher on the plot, be mindful that this is a tragedy, and a very heavy one at that. You might like to take the intermission even if you watch at home, and by the time it is over you'll be exhausted.

8144276,5,B000I6O7VY,"Another excellent Shakespeare adaptation by Bhardwaj, this time moving the story of ""Othello"" to the modern Indian underworld, and making Othello (here called Omkara) not black, but a half-caste.

The acting is all of a very high order -- understated but intense, and even a familiarity with the events of the play didn't keep this from feeling suspenseful, intense and occasionally quite emotional.

If you have the clich vision of a Bollywood film in mind, you're in for a pleasant surprise. The acting is naturalistic, not histrionic (with only one or two exceptions in supporting roles). There is a song or two, but they flow naturally out of the action, in situations where singing is appropriate (e.g. a performance by one of the characters at a party, where others join in).

Note: this is an adaptation of the story, the language is not Shakespeare's. The dialogue is contemporary, and story elements are changed, so this isn't for purists. On the other hand, no familiarity with the original is needed to fully enjoy this complex tale of passion, politics and betrayal. It is alive, and filled with social commentary, romance, and ever evolving alliances. The film also looks great.

I can't comment on the visual quality of this version, but the region 1 Eros DVD of this film looks better than the Eagle blu-ray of it's twin Maqbool (Bhardwaj's take on Macbeth).",1456617600,,1373,4.93073593073593
