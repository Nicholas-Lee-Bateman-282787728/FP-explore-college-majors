I'm enjoying these lessons, but not coming along as fast as I would like.  I must admit though, I haven't practiced like I should, either.  When I lost my first copy, I had no desire to look for something else.  Now that it's here, It's like reacquainting myself with an old friend.  I'm back at the earlier lessons, but thrilled to be here, and using other books, too.  Wish me good skills in good time!",1370304000,5,541,4.469387755102041
8305370,2,B001GH3CYC,"I started out this dvd waiting to be impressed and was very disappointed.  Dude, plucking one string can hardly be called ""playing"" - it does not constitute a warm-up or even tuning your bass.  Your claim should have been if I can teach you how to play a note in under one minute then you can learn to play the bass.  I had already begun my path to learning to play the bass so this point was moot to me.  I bought this dvd to round out some of my other lessons but after viewing the first fifteen minutes of the dvd, I took it out of my player and decided it was a waste of my money.  For those of you who aspire to be good bass players, try something like eMedia's Bass Method.  It is a little more expensive but well worth it.",1329696000,4,729,3.9931034482758623
8305371,5,B001GH3CYC,"This video does a great job of laying a foundation for playing the bass.  The inclusion of bass clef musical note instruction is appreciated.  The real basics of music theory are also covered NOT ad nauseum, so I was not put off by it since I am a trained musician and can read music. I just did not know how to play the bass guitar.  IT IS better than I expected and I will be using it repeatedly until I GET it all.  LOOKING FOR THE EASIEST HARMONICA LESSON ON CD?  Mine is the one.  Email me  and ask about my one hour and you can play.....Harmonica  CD.  cwsdave@aol.com",1286064000,6,574,4.192660550458716
