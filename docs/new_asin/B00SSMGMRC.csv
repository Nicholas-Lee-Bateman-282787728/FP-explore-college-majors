6991949,5,B00SSMGMRC,"I work for a nonprofit that assists homeless veterans and their families, so I'm quite well versed in the issues surrounding poverty and homelessness and am often disappointed in public discussions surrounding this topic. I've watched several documentaries about poverty and am frequently frustrated by the lack of attention paid to public policy that impacts wealth (and the lack thereof) in America. This documentary did an excellent job of putting a human face on some painful statistics while also addressing the policies that both help and hurt working families. Well rounded, great documentary. By far the best I've seen on poverty in America. I can only hope it spurs people to take action in their communities and pay attention to the policies their elected leaders support.",1431907200,2,782,5.214285714285714
6991950,1,B00SSMGMRC,Very depressing documentary reinforcing how people with no skills/education and low intelligence have crappy economic things happen to them....but never understand why......because they are stupid.,1429920000,,197,6.92
6991951,5,B00SSMGMRC,Interesting movie.,1429315200,,18,8.5
6991952,3,B00SSMGMRC,Good information but it does have a slight political agenda.,1429142400,,60,5.1

6991954,5,B00SSMGMRC,"I chose to watch this on a friend's recommendation and I was completely blown away. As someone who has grown up in the middle class, it hit home so to speak, and I will not forget these stories, nor the thin line that I walk between comfortability and possible poverty. This film is important; to remember that there is suffering, and to look forward to what we can do to ease it in the future. There are many documentaries that try to show the aftermath of the American recession, but it's rare to find one that truly cares about the subjects they bring to light. It's clear that each family featured is not there solely to be exposed, but to really tell their story, and each one is worth knowing. Often as headlines tell us, the economy has gotten better and better, we tend to want to forget that there is still serious suffering in and throughout the country; and this film is an important reminder. I was relieved to find that on the film's website, there are personal updates from the families featured; a strangely comforting but real and personal message.",1425254400,9,1064,4.546875
8699137,1,B00SSMGMRC,I was not able to view this documentary. It was nothing but snow and skipping throughout entire program. Very frustrating,1525046400,,121,5.1
8699138,5,B00SSMGMRC,Is an eye opening view of how close we all are to homelessness  and financial disaster. It showed that even those with a college degree and 2 incomes can suddenly face frightening life situations. These families tug at my heartstrings and my prayers are with them.,1518739200,,264,4.739130434782608
8699139,5,B00SSMGMRC,"This is an exceptional documentary about an important topic. And as income inequality grows and grows in the U.S., it becomes even more of a must-see film each year. Thank you to the participants for opening up their lives to us for this. Highly recommended.",1512432000,,258,4.7555555555555555
8699140,5,B00SSMGMRC,Very eye opening even though I belonged to this demographic group not that long ago and also work in the sector that serves people like those showcased in the movie. Very indicative of many US cities where those who are struggling are largely hidden.,1499299200,,250,4.704545454545454
8699141,5,B00SSMGMRC,"Great documentary on what we all know.
Many Americans who seek help are underemployed or desperately seeking work.
Social services subsidize major corporations and companies which have seen record profits because
they underpay their employees.  Thus, social services where they be from the government or nonprofits subsidize
corporations.  I enjoyed watching all these families and any viewer can see themselves in these stories.",1496707200,,429,5.7936507936507935
8699142,3,B00SSMGMRC,"The main message of this movie was poignant and loud and clear..""if we are all better off, then we are all better off"", but did anyone else notice how many of the moms who were struggling to feed their families had perfectly manicured nails, with he professional tips and everything? it just makes me wonder if we really had the whole story...",1482710400,2,343,4.548387096774194
8699143,4,B00SSMGMRC,Good movie,1475452800,,10,4.5

8699145,4,B00SSMGMRC,Needs to ve watched.,1446163200,,20,4.25
8699146,5,B00SSMGMRC,"Riveting and real.  If this doesn't make you angry, you're either missing a brain or a pulse.",1444694400,,93,4.470588235294118
