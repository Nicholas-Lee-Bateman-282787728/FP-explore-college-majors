Sadly, I am not sure if this DvD has english subtitles. I will not reveal how I came to know it, but if there was a legitimate english release (even if its a VHS or Laserdisc copy) this will still be worth watching even if it meant extra equipment to do so. This is glorious art. No other way to say it. It is action packed, dark, funny, and has a humbly majesty to the whole thing that feels like watching a sunset that can actually sing to you.

Buy a copy if you can and pray that there will be an english subtitled release in the future.",1365120000,4,754,4.060402684563758
8332513,5,B001P82XPG,"Upon first watch, its easy to dismiss it as pointless eye candy.. but after a few watches you realize you're completely wrong. it literally tells an entire story through mind-bending/mesmerizing psychedelic tapestries.. this is jankovics masterpiece imo, nek a Csodaszarvasrl is a close second. Feherlofia is a pinnacle in animation, must see.

Region 2 dvd, as labeled so no need to give it a poor rating because of that as some have. besides, all region dvd players are easy to find, only $40 or so",1338768000,6,500,4.882352941176471
