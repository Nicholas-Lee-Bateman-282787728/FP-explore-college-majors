8450361,5,B004ZQJ5CO,"This package brings together four 55-minute specials on the red planet.  The first two deal primarily with the logistics of the Spirit and Opportunity missions, both of which landed robotic rovers on Mars, with varying degrees of success.  The third reports findings from the Phoenix mission, which landed in the north polar latitudes.  There were several notable findings: Mars does contain water under the surface, the soil in this region is less acidic than at the equator, but there was also evidence of toxic perchlorates.  The commentary also notes that 3.5 billion years ago, Mars evidently had oceans and conditions favorable to life.  One hypothesis as to why Mars evolved into a frozen desert is that an asteroid strike blew away its atmosphere.  This might also account for its distinctive topography: northern lowlands, southern highlands.  The fourth deals with the logistics of creating human colonies on Mars.  This is a riveting collection for anyone interested in planetary science.",1522627200,,999,5.2784810126582276

8450366,4,B004ZQJ5CO,"A good documentary about Mars.

This documentary was made prior to Obama canceling America's planed manned trip to Mars.  Because of this some of the connections made about a manned journey to Mars are hollow.  However I still recommend this DVD.",1360454400,4,246,4.951219512195122
