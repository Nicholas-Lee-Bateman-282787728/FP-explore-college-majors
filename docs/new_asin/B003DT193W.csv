4112043,5,B003DT193W,"A great Max & Ruby DVD. My grandchildren (and me) love Max & Ruby and this has very good stories.  If you are a M&R fan, this DVD is a must have.",1286236800,5,145,3.53125
4112044,5,B003DT193W,"""Max and Ruby"" is an enjoyable, fun, animated children's series that can easily be appreciated by young and old.  I mean this is in true sincerity as I have had the opportunity to watch this series when my son was 1-years-old and then most recently as my son was hooked on the series once again at age 7.

The children's animated series was created by author/illustrator Rosemary Wells who based the series on her two daughters and the experiences they had with friends and in school.  The series debuted in 2002 (the pilot was shown on TV back in 2001 on Noggin) and continues to air with a total of four seasons being shown on Nick Jr. and Nickelodeon.

""Max and Ruby"" revolves around seven-year-old Ruby and her younger three year-old brother Max.  Typically, the stories revolve around Ruby working on a project and Max somehow trying to get her attention (or cause a disturbance) and easily distracting her.  But somehow, whenever Ruby gets into a jam, her younger brother ends up helping her out in some form.

In each episode of ""Max & Ruby"" are three mini-episodes.  In ""Max & Ruby: A Visit with Grandma"", a total of four episodes (12 mini-episodes total) revolves around Max, Ruby & their grandmother.

The episodes featured on this DVD are:

  * Grandma's Treasure Hunt, Ruby's Jigsaw Puzzle and Ruby's Recital - In this episode, Ruby and her friend Louise try to fight Grandma's treasure with the help of Pirate Max.  In the second episode, Ruby works on a new puzzle and knowing that if she is missing a piece, she can't complete the puzzle but maybe Max can help her find it.  In the third episode, Grandma is coming over for a recital but will she find an instrument to play?
  * Ruby's Rainbow, Home Tweet Home, Max's Mudpie - Max wants to play outside but Ruby wants to make rainbow paintings for her grandmother.  In the second episode, Ruby and Louise are working on a birdhouse but her hungry brother Max tends to keep bothering her.  The third's episode features Max wanting to make a mudpie for Grandma.
  * Ruby's Home Run, Ruby's missing Tune, Ruby's Hand Stand - Ruby wants to play baseball but Max's toys are in the way.  Ruby plans to do a ballet for Grandma but she forgets the music (which Max can easily remember).  In the third mini-episode, Ruby practices gymnastics but Max keeps bothering her and wants to play in the swing instead.
  * Ruby's Good Neighbor Report, Candy Counting, Ruby's New Shoes - Grandma, Ruby and Max look for ""the best neighbor"".  The second episode features Ruby expecting Max to help her in a candy counting contest.  The third episode features Max wanting to see Super Bunny but he has to go shoe shopping with Grandma and Ruby instead.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Max & Ruby"" is featured in full screen and for the most part, vibrant, colorful and well-animated.  The backgrounds feature artistic/oil painted backgrounds with plenty of detail while Max & Ruby and friends are animated.  Although the characters are not shaded, the detailed background compliments the character animation.

Audio is presented in Dolby Digital (English Stereo).  The series is front channel driven and testing this DVD on a receiver, regular TV and on computer, the dialogue is clear and understandable.

As for subtitles, there are no subtitles but the series does feature closed-captions.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Max & Ruby: A Visit with Grandma"" does not come with any special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

If there was one children's show that I literally watched my son grow up to, it would be ""Max & Ruby"".  Nickelodeon (and Noggin) had various shows for children in the early-2000's from ""Dora the Explorer"" and ""Blue's Clues"" but there was something about ""Max & Ruby"" that captured my son's attention and even seven years later, upon reviewing the DVD ""Max & Ruby: A Visit with Grandma"", although he doesn't watch the children's shows these days, he was hooked on watching this animated series once again.

And it's probably one of the few series that I don't mind watching with him over and over.  Granted, it's because I can easily remember him loving this show on television when he was much younger but it's a series that he can learn about teamwork and also brother/sister relations, decision-making and more.

It's important to note that the series is not educational in the sense when compared to ""Blue's Clues"", ""Go Diego Go!"", ""Dora the Explorer"" or ""Yo Gabba Gabba!"".  There is no host and the characters do not speak to the audience.  It's typically a cartoon that has a storyline and it helps that these episodes are short, easy to follow and for the most part, are safe and enjoyable.

As for the DVD, you do get four episodes (12 mini-episodes total) but I am surprised that this is another Nickelodeon DVD with no special features.  There are games, printables, activities and more on [...] but it would be nice if Nickelodeon can include some of these features ala DVD-Rom.

But overall, ""Max & Ruby: A Visit with Grandma"" is a enjoyable DVD for the children.  Plenty of good episodes featuring Max, Ruby and also Grandma.  If you are a parent looking for a perfect children's DVD for Summer vacation, for a long commute to keep them busy in the car or just a safe, children's series, look no further, ""Max & Ruby"" is definitely recommended!",1276560000,22,5291,4.737417943107221
4112045,5,B003DT193W,"Our granddaughter just turned two and she loves Max & Ruby. We have several of the books and DVDs and she is enthralled with all of them. Max & Ruby are her favorite DVDs--she doesn't want to watch anything else. Highly recommend this and any other Max & Ruby items. The simple, low key and pleasant stories are perfect for little ones. Too much on tv/dvd for kids today is frenetically paced, high energy, loud and obnoxious. Not so with Max & Ruby. Our granddaughter is a very busy two year-old yet Max & Ruby always hold her interest without the loud, attention grabbing tactics of some shows. Sweet stories in the books match up to some of the DVDs. Max & Ruby always show tolerance and understanding even when little brother Max is getting under big sister Ruby's skin....and the stories always end up with little Max having something to offer his bigger and ""all-knowing"" sister Ruby. Our granddaughter even plays pretend Max & Ruby story lines on her own.....so fun to watch her incorporate their antics into her own play. Based on our granddaughter's love of all things Max & Ruby, I highly recommend this item.",1392336000,4,1119,4.656565656565657

8394917,4,B003DT193W,"Using my Grandpa`s account. We borrowed this Nickelodeon DVD from a relative`s house. My brother watched this DVD all of the time when he was little. He loved it! However, it can get really annoying when Ruby bosses Max around. She treats Max like a baby and all he is doing is trying to play. We wound up keeping this DVD and I am thinking about giving it away, since my brother is almost 6 and my cousins are WAY to old for this DVD.

What the show is about:

Max & Ruby is a 2002 Canadian-American animated series that is aimed at preschoolers. Created by children's book author/illustrator Rosemary Wells and based on the world of her Max and Ruby books, the episodes present stories about Max, a rambunctious and determined preschool-aged rabbit, and his older sister, Ruby, a patient, goal-oriented, sometimes restrictive rabbit. A pilot episode for this series aired in 2001 and the program appeared as a regular series on October 3, 2002. According to Rosemary Wells on the Nick Jr. website, ""Max & Ruby celebrates the relationship between Ruby and her younger brother, Max, and the universal nature of sibling relationships.

Rosemary Wells, the author of the children's books the show is based on, says: ""We don't see Max and Ruby's parents because I believe that kids resolve their issues and conflicts differently when they're on their own. The television series gives kids a sense about how these two siblings resolve their conflicts in a humorous and entertaining way. For the first season, Jamie Whitney was the director, and the first episodes were mostly written by Kate Barris and Patrick Granleese. While some of the stories were adapted from the books, the number of TV episodes eventually surpassed the number of books written by Wells.

Characters:

Max - A white rabbit who is Ruby's little brother. His typical role in every episode of the TV series is to come up with an idea or desire against Ruby's will. Ruby will try to talk him out of it, but Max would keep asking for what he wants, but Ruby would continue her will, making Max lose hope in getting what he desires and then find a way to outsmart Ruby and her friends. He usually says just one repeated word per episode to express his desire or idea, such as ""faster"", sometimes a phrase such as ""bad egg"", or even short sentences. This makes communicating with others difficult as they often misinterpret him. He wears blue overalls with a red-striped cream shirt, however, sometimes Max wears other outfits. His best friend is Louise's cousin, Morris who acts as if he was Max's sidekick. He often manages to be more clever than his older sister and her friends.[citation needed] But sometimes manages to help Ruby and her friends from his tricks. He often plays with his toys.

Ruby - A white rabbit and Max's older sister.[5] Her role in the TV series to try to talk Max out of an idea or desire he has and she would continue her will when Max asks for what he wants, ending with Max completely losing hope in getting his desire, however he would always find a way to outsmart Ruby and her friends. Her appearance is virtually exactly the same as Max, except that she's taller and wears a yellow dress with flower patterns in seasons one and two, then switches to a pink dress in seasons three and four. She behaves in an over-protective and maternal manner to Max, for example persuading him to do something against his will because, according to her, ""it's what's best for him"". She likes to have tea parties, or regular parties with her dolls or friends as guests. She is often bossy or even rude to Max, often losing patience with him, however, she does love him. She is usually seen with at least one of her friends, often Louise, who is her best friend.[citation needed] It is revealed that Max is given some of her toys when she's outgrown them, and some toys they share, for example in an episode called ""Max's Rabbit Racer"", Max now owns Ruby's doll Pinocchio. She always refers to the toys by their entire brand names (for example, she will say ""your Rescue Ranger Emergency Ambulance"", instead of ""your ambulance""). She and Louise have a crush on their classmate Roger Piazza who sometimes helps babysit Max in later episodes.[citation needed]
Other characters

Grandma - Max and Ruby's grandmother. She likes to have fun and has an attic full of clothes and a treasure box that has a memory picture of herself and her husband (who has not made any appearances in the TV series) wearing some fancy clothes to a festival. She has gray fur, wears a blue dress and is frequently involved with her grandchildren. She loves her grandchildren equally but Max is often Grandma's confidant when she plans something special, since she knows Max can keep a secret. Even though Ruby believes that Grandma won't like Max's ideas she is always revealed to like both Max and Ruby's ideas equally, however she usually sides with Max when Max outsmarts Ruby and when Ruby assumes Grandma will love her ideas better than Max's. She once lived with their grandfather who went to an annual festival with her but since he has not appeared nor mentioned it is presumed that he has been deceased for a while. .[citation needed]

Louise - A rabbit who is Ruby's best friend.[citation needed] She likes to have fun and has a cousin named Morris who is friends with Max, and Morris also manages to be more clever than her. She is also known for liking to attend parties and events like Max's birthday, and beach parties. She has auburn fur and wears a green tartan dress. Physically, she looks similar to Ruby except she's slightly taller. She sometimes isn't sure about Ruby's ideas but decides to help her out anyway and mostly decides to join her in her ideas.

Valerie - A friend of Ruby's, she is brown, wears a red and gold dress, has glasses and is shorter than Ruby and her other friends. She is very talented at playing the recorder and is in Bunny Scouts with Ruby.

Martha - A friend of Ruby's; however she is not seen as often as Louise or Valerie. She goes to, and is usually seen, at Bunny Scouts with Ruby, Louise, and Valerie, but sometimes joins them when playing. She has gold fur and is the only one of Ruby's friends with eyelashes.[citation needed]

The Huffingtons - A family consisting of Mrs. Huffington, Mr. Huffington, and Baby Huffington. Mrs. Huffington is a talented Baton twirler, and she taught Ruby and Louise how to twirl batons and is one of the new Bunny Scout leaders since the episode ""Max's Nightlight"". Mr. Huffington is shown with various jobs, he has appeared as a clown and a photographer.

The Piazzas - A family who owns and operates the Market, consisting of Roger and Mr. Piazza. Roger's mother has never been seen. Roger is ""almost seven and a half"" years old.[6] He treats Max like a little brother and is into basketball, football, sledding, hockey, and toy racing cars (to Ruby and Louise's dismay). Roger has a cameo in the episode ""Max's Rocket Run"" where he sleds down the biggest sledding hill, Rocket Run with a large group of bunnies, three days after Christmas which is his first appearance. Louise and Ruby are infatuated with him. In the first two seasons he says only ""Uh-huh"" and ""Uh-uh"", but speaks completely in season three, season four, and season five. He often helps his father at his store and helps out with Max and Ruby's projects.

Bunny Scout Leader - The leader of the Bunny Scouts, to which Ruby, Louise, Martha, and Valerie are members. She is seen infrequently, usually testing the girls to earn badges.

Morris - Max's best friend and Louise's cousin. He doesn't know how to talk as well as Max. Upon their first meeting, he was unfriendly towards Max, but they quickly became friends and he is Max's sidekick, going along with whatever Max is doing.[citation needed]

Candi - Owner of a candy shop. Ruby has worked in her store and visits her occasionally.

Rosalinda - Owner of a gift shop that sells jewelry and collectibles and a friend of Max and Ruby's grandmother.

Katie - Waitress at the diner. (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_%26_Ruby)

I`m giving this product 4 stars because Ruby is so annoying, but my brother LOVED it! If you are looking for a Rosemary Wells book based TV show on DVD, I recommend buying a Timothy Goes To School DVD, because it is less annoying than Max and Ruby.
