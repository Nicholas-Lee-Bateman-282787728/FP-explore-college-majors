8081975,2,B000B5XPCE,"I got this for my 7 and 10 year old boys who are really into Robin Hood now.  They watched the old disney movie of Robin Hood and loved it.  However, the picture in this is often very dark making it difficult to see the actors.  Also the sound is very bad.  Some of the plots are a little boring.  But I think my kids would still be okay with watching them if it was better quality.  I wanted something not so violent or fraught with sexual innuendo, which this isn't.  I just wish it was easier to watch.",1169337600,,505,4.040404040404041
8081976,5,B000B5XPCE,"I purchased from Amazon.co.uk each of the four seasons of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" - all 143 episodes - for about $20 per season.

Digital transfer was excellent and our entire family has enjoyed the series. Packaging involved sturdy plastic cases, each containing 2 DVD's, with 8 episodes per disk. I found this a great value and wanted to recommend it to others interested in the Robin Hood series.",1147219200,2,406,4.8
8081977,5,B000B5XPCE,"4 More great investments in classic television are delivered by this DVD along with some really fine episodes:

ERRAND OF MERCY sees Robin & Little John help deliver medicine to those struck by St. Andrew's Fire, a very well plotted episode.

SECRET MISSION quality is reflected in the foibles of the main supporting character, however I can't explain it without telling the secret of this episode.

RANSOM is another quality episode where the son of the ""villian"" has a sense of fair play but it puts Robin in great danger.

CHILDREN OF THE GREENWOOD is another story where the ""villian"" is not as bad as he seems.  A man who flees a false murder charge and the Lord of the Manor takes in his children but makes the serfs.",1142985600,3,723,4.573643410852713
