8611300,5,B00F1BFWB0,A very good account of what happened during Sandy and what can still happen if the weather continues to get more dangerous as years pass do to climate change.,1428969600,,158,4.482758620689655
8611301,5,B00F1BFWB0,"This is a magnificent followup to the Nova program on superstorm Sandy, which recently hit the East Coast.  This time we revisit the Big Apple and find that Con Edison has been working to shore up the defenses of one facility that was flooded and suffered a short, then an exploding transformer, which led to a power outage for many and also a broken electrical system.  Then we visit Verizon's facilities, where the seawater ate away much of the copper wiring in their cables; they've replaced that with fiber optics -- glass is impervious to water.  Then we visit with a retired firefighter who lives in a flood-prone area of the city; he is trying to shore up their defenses.  All of these efforts are using new and better ways to survive an even worse event.

Next we go to the Netherlands, where the people have long been fighting the sea with dikes/levees, windmills that pump the water back out to sea, and a number of projects that limit how much seawater does get in.  They've found that that is not always the best way, for it destroys some of the lowlands and estuaries that can provide protection from a storm.  The same is true in New Orleans, where they've forced the Mississippi River to flow through concrete so it can't replenish the delta, the vast wetlands that used to be all around (and through) the city.

All are now turning to a ""green solution"", not just the gray one of more concrete.  In New York, they're putting dirt in places where it used to be and planting vegetation that will thrive in seawater -- the roots will anchor the soil and not let it get washed away so easily.  Dams and concrete will still be used, but along with the wetlands and such that can not only absorb a lot of water, but can absorb a lot of the energy of a big storm as it comes in -- wetlands, it turns out, can take one heck of a punch!

All of this becomes more necessary as the planet continues to warm up, glacial ice flows into the oceans, causing them to rise, and probably leading to bigger, stronger hurricanes.  Places like New York, New Orleans and the Netherlands have a better chance of keeping themselves safe, while some places with large coastlines (like Florida) or very low land masses, like many islands, may not survive much longer.

There's much to think about here and the program gets things started.",1423180800,,2328,4.501187648456057
