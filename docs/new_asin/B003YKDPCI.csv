4229847,3,B003YKDPCI,"I bought this series for my grandma for Christmas and it is very funny.  The only problem is not all of the discs will play.  It is a very funny series as anyone who has watched it on television knows but with the prospect of having to buy a couple of the seasons again with the defective discs, I'm not sure it was worth the money.",1264291200,46,332,4.015151515151516

4229850,5,B003YKDPCI,"Blanche, Rose, Sofia and of course Dorothy played so well by Bea Arthur was a sensational tv show.
I just had to have the whole series.
Some of the episodes are unforgettable and hilarious. I have so many, many favorites. I'm going to keep them to myself, rather than making a boringly long, personal review.
Blanche and her boyfriends, Rose and her outlook, Sofia's great wit and Dorothy being the butt of jokes is just precious.
I love the complete set and am very appreciative of owning it.",1253750400,36,493,4.613636363636363

4229872,4,B003YKDPCI,"I just bought this whole DVD set of ""The Golden Girls"" show off the ebay website, and all seven seasons it is. This is a show that I remember from way back when I was a kid, and I thought it was a good show. And I still to this day love this show ""The Golden Girls"", because it brings back good memories. Since I just even bought the whole DVD set of the show, I got a feeling it would put me in a happy zone by enjoying it. I even like the sound of the music playing in the background when they view the house at the beginning of the episodes, after hearing the theme song and showing the main characters. I find this show ""The Golden Girls"" was even filmed in a nice neighborhood, and I read that the show was also filmed Miami FL, which I find is a great place. And it's one of the best show I've ever seen. It even brings back memories of all the main characters that passed away, except Betty White. Betty White is the only main character that's still living, and I think she's a good actress.",1501804800,,998,4.045454545454546

4229879,5,B003YKDPCI,"I'd watch Golden Girls every morning on Hallmark. Finally, realizing that I wanted more and see more than just Season one repeatedly, I got this and have never regretted it! It is just wonderful. The cases are easy to open, disks easy to remove and the collection overall, was done nicely.",1495670400,,289,4.686274509803922
4229880,5,B003YKDPCI,"I grew up watching the Golden Girls, then saw it again in syndication in the late 80's, and now on Hallmark.  There are some episodes, and scenes, that just never get old: the Pilot, where we find out immediately just how idiotic Rose was, how hateful and uber-sarcastic Dorothy was, how acid-tongued Sofia was, and Blanche...well...  Probably the only TV character who could get over-heated discussing everything from shoe-shopping to fairy tales, dolphins and ballroom dancing.  And had absolutely no qualms about stealing men from the others at every opportunity.  Rose is, basically, a 6-year-old Senior Citizen: forever not following the conversation, coming to the hilariously-wrong conclusion, and *constantly* reminiscing about ""Back in St. Olaf..."".  Dorothy is an unhappy, constantly put-upon divorcee (whose ex-husband gives new meaning to the phrase ""douche-bag""), whose own mother thinks she's a loser.  She's also the self-described ""only competent, sensible person in the house"".  She's also quickest to take Blanche -- who constantly gushes about her ""stunning, youthful body"" and ""ravishing Southern beauty"" -- down a peg: ""In what Blanche, *dog* years?"", ""The only thing 40-ish in this room is your hair-do"", ""Looks like someone poured about 90 extra minutes of sand into the bottom (of her 'hourglass' figure), not to mention remarks about her promiscuity: ""You've been under more men than a nautical toilet"", ""The Marines are looking for a few good men who have NOT *slept* with Blanche Devereaux!""  Sofia.  Four words: ""Picture it, Sicily-1922.""
For a show that ran mostly during the 80's, it was remarkably ahead of its time: plots revolved around homosexuality/gay marriage, domestic violence, single parenthood, AIDS, teen pregnancy (not just Dorothy's), illiteracy, sexual harassment, age discrimination, racism... But always loaded with friendship, love and humor.  Also, there were a lot of guest spots:a very *old* Cesar Romero, Julio Iglesias, Paul Rodriguez, Rita Moreno, and a *very* early George Clooney!  Don't be confused by how many guest-stars played more than one character!
I have seen every episode countless times -- have some memorized -- but some scenes are just classic, eternal!!",1493942400,,2223,5.470760233918129

4229901,1,B003YKDPCI,"As a lifelong Golden Girls fan, I was beyond excited to treat myself with the complete DVD collection. As soon as it was delivered, I opened a season just to experience a couple of episodes after work. Much to my surprise and ultimate disappointment, the video quality on these episodes is inexplicably terrible. I don't know why, but the quality is SO POOR that making out facial expressions or eye rolls is near impossible. I tried different discs, but every one had the same issue. A compression issue maybe? It doesn't even compare to the quality I see when I watch it on cable. It was genuinely heartbreaking and I wish I had been prepared for that experience. I guess I will continue watching episodes as I catch them re-running on cable.",1489795200,13,744,4.643939393939394

If you watch the show when it's on tv, it's really not an HD show... With these discs, the picture quality is better when you watch on a small tv. I watched on a large tv and the quality wasn't as good. Other than that, I would recommend this set as it is hard to find other places. Seems overpriced, though.",1484265600,,467,4.142857142857143
4229912,1,B003YKDPCI,"I speak nothing if the quality of the show with this one star review - it's one of the best TV shows ever made. Fine acting, writing, directing. I speak only to the quality of this particular DVD set. As other reviewers have stated, these are rather expensive for being such cheap pieces of crap. For starters, the video quality is horrendously awful, like watching on a dial-up modem from 1999. Ah, but surely the packaging makes up for the poor video quality, right? Alas the packaging is also complete garbage. Broken, cheap, sad. Surely there must be better quality GG sets out there for the money. Like some of the other reviewers I question whether these are authentic from the manufacturer or someone is counterfeiting them.

4229937,3,B003YKDPCI,"When I first received this Golden Girls:  The Complete Set, it was in excellent shape, as far as the exterior; looked brand new; no smudges or scratches, etc., and in the First Season, no problems, but in most Seasons since then, there have been some problems with not being able to see some of the programs,.  We don't see any obvious scratches on most of them, but not being able to see some of the weeks, at all or in its entirety was so frustrating, I've not watched the last few Seasons, at all.  I did not see ""Golden Girls"" when it was on TV, years ago, and last Winter, became very entertained by them on TV, in our Florida Winter home, but the too many Commercials on TV took away from some of the Scenes.  I was so excited to have my own set, but it has been disappointing having more and more obvious flaws on the Discs, that I've not watched any since then.  I know it's been too much time that has passed since you sent this Review to me, to do anything about it, but just wanted you to have some Feedback.  I really don't want to pay Full price, for brand new, unless I can only get maybe 2  at a time, because the entire set, brand new, costs more than I'm comfortable paying, and it does take me awhile to watch all of the Seasons.  Thank you for listening to my complaint.",1474675200,3,1289,4.169354838709677

I was personally devastated when each of them - save Betty White - died and I can only hope she'll live on at least a few more years.

Finally I  bit the bullet, used a gift card to make the purchase only to find after a brief review the quality of the video is absolutely sub standard and ultimately the discs render intermittent skips and restarts. Disappointing. This is not the fault of the seller but the manufacturer. This was purchased in NEW condition. Not acceptable. Poor quality.

Suggestion, wait for another production company such as ""Shout"" to 're-release this classic in the manner in which it deserves.",1421020800,2,578,4.948453608247423

4230042,1,B003YKDPCI,"This review is about the physical product, not the TV series. The series is great. It will have anyone laughing.

You can save money not buying this set. Ignore the user submitted photos of the set. There is no replica of Sophia's classic purse or playing cards with it. I don't know if that was a limited time thing or what. It is probably my own fault for thinking I'd get these items since they are not shown in the actual product photo, or listed in the description. I just went by past history of items on here where user submitted photos were of the actual product being sold and sometimes showed more than the product photo. I think the photos should be removed to avoid confusion.

So what you actually get is the same seven seasons' boxes you can buy individually, just shrink wrapped together. I paid $155 for the set. When I saw what I received I looked at the price of buying the seven seasons individually, and it is about $80. So save yourselves almost 50% and just buy them each individually. You get the same great show, in the exact same boxes, and on the same discs.",1419638400,6,1084,4.388059701492537

The DVD packaging is flimsy and the plastic parts that hold the DVD in place aren't even attached to the packaging for each season. It's like it was made at home by a counterfeiter. The image quality of the DVDs are terrible!!! It's like they didn't even try to make it better. On the earlier seasons, it even looks like they just copied it straight from VHS format without doing any tweaking at all.

4230156,5,B003YKDPCI,"I purchased the individual seasons of The Golden Girls as they were released, so I had no reason to get this ""Complete Collection,"" but I love the show and wanted to review it as a whole instead of just one season. It looked really cute in the store... except for the fact that Sophia's purse was simply cardboard. You'd think if they couldn't make it actual bamboo, it could at least be tin, so it would be more durable! I think the only appeal of the complete set is the playing cards, since the DVDs inside are the same as the individual seasons we all purchased before. Now if only they would sell an empty cardboard purse for $3, we could all have this cute item sitting on our shelf!

This is one of my top 3 shows of all time, along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Love-Lucy-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000TGJ8B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Love Lucy: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-in-the-Family-Complete-First-Season/dp/B002E58FT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All in the Family: Complete First Season</a>.

Here is some trivia: Two of the main four writers of I Love Lucy wrote some of the episodes of All in the Family. Maude, another show I love, was a spin-off of All in the Family. Maude, of course, starred Bea Arthur and Rue McClanahan, two of the stars of The Golden Girls. Marc Cherry is the creator of Desperate Housewives, one of my current favorites, and he was also behind the scenes on The Golden Girls. So from 1951 to 2012, all those favorite shows of mine are linked, in one way or another. It's no wonder I love them all!

I don't really need to describe The Golden Girls. If you are here, you are a fan. Instead I will list a favorite episode for each ""girl.""
Bea Arthur / Dorothy (my personal favorite): ""Goodbye, Mr. Gordon""... our unshakeable Dorothy acts like a silly giggling teenager because of a crush on a guy
Betty White / Rose: ""Henny Penny - Straight, No Chaser""... all 3 girls are hilarious as Henny Penny, Turkey Lurkey, and Goosey Loosey, but Betty White seems particularly adept at playing a chicken somehow...
Rue McClanahan / Blanche: ""Sick and Tired, Part 2""... this is a ""Dorothy"" episode, but Rue is amazing in it, as Blanche stays up for 72 hours to write her masterpiece novel and thinks she's hallucinating every time she looks at the egg yolks Rose has left in a baggie: ""I see little balls of sunshine in a bag!""
Estelle Getty / Sophia: ""Long Day's Journey Into Marinara""... one of two episodes where Sophia trades Italian curses with her sister
Herb Edelman / Stan: ""The Monkey Show""... Stan transfers his love for Dorothy to a traffic cone dressed as a monkey
Group effort: ""Home Again Rose, Part 2""... Rose dreams the girls have died and gotten their heads frozen, and they all wake up with with their heads on plates on ice on the kitchen table
Honorable mention: ""Love Under the Big Top,"" just because Dick Van Dyke guest stars as Dorothy's boyfriend... the clown!

Naturally, I had trouble narrowing it down to just a few. This is a show I could watch over and over. And over and over. The fact that this was an ensemble show is why I might even put this above I Love Lucy. 95% of Lucy episodes were about Lucy. On The Golden Girls, the episodes took turns being about each girl, and many were about them as a group. It worked perfectly and made the situation of them living together as best friends even more believable. They also rarely had to leave the living room and kitchen set to make us laugh like crazy. What talent that was. Best show ever!",1336521600,,3887,5.0703125

4230162,5,B003YKDPCI,"The complete collection of one of the greatest situation comedies ever is ready for your viewing pleasure - and convenience!  With all seven seasons of The Golden Girls at the palm of your hands, you're free to watch whichever episode you wish whenever you wish.  Or you can watch the entire collection, episode by episode, season by season.  Either way you're guaranteed hours and hours of heartwarming, feel-good laughter.

The Golden Girls began its 7-year run on NBC on September 14, 1985, with the last first-run episode airing May 9, 1992.  Even after the finale the series continued to soar in popularity in the subsequent world of reruns.  Among the many reasons for the show's success were its sharp, witty writing and wonderfully talented cast.  Beatrice Arthur, Betty White, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty all won Emmy awards for their brilliant portrayals of four of TV's most beloved and memorable characters:  the strong and sarcastic Dorothy Zbornak; sweet and terminally naive Rose Nylund; man-hungry and vain Southern belle Blanche Devereaux; and Sicilian spitfire Sophia Petrillo.

Genuine character humor and warmth are a rarity in so-called sitcoms of today, but both qualities shine in The Golden Girls and serve as a reminder of when television was simply better on all levels.  This 25th Anniversary Complete Collection contains a treasure of timeless Golden memories.  Some of my favorite episodes include the following:  ""The Triangle"" (Season 1); ""Ladies of the Evening,"" ""Isn't It Romantic,"" ""Forgive Me, Father"" (Season 2); ""Strange Bedfellows"" (Season 3); ""Yes, We Have No Havanas,"" ""Love Me Tender,"" ""Till Death Do We Volley"" (Season 4); ""The Accurate Conception"" (Season 5); ""Sister of the Bride"" (Season 6); ""Goodbye, Mr. Gordon"" and ""One Flew Out of the Cuckoo's Nest"" (Season 7).

For die-hard series enthusiasts, this limited-edition DVD set includes a deck of character-themed playing cards and is housed in a collectible replica of Sophia's wicker purse - the handles of which are flimsy and not at all sturdy.  If you rather not own these two items, amazon.com offers the complete collection of just the DVDs themselves at a lower price.

To all involved in The Golden Girls and these DVD releases, a heartfelt ""Thank you for being a friend."" :)",1316995200,,2285,5.154471544715447

Dorothy is my favourite character. She is so sharp and sarcastic. Sophia is awesome with her oft-invented tales of life in Sicily and Brooklyn. Rose is hilarious with her ditziness and St-Olaf stories. Then there is Blanche, the sexiest senior to hit the shores of Miami since Kim Kardashian's mother! The entire series should be owned by all!

This set however brings them all back into my life. ( right now daily I have had it 3 months and have watched them all at least 4 times) I am not sure where I would be without the constant laughter and love of these for nutty women in my life. Sophia is a particular inspiration. To see somone so vibrant adn Fiesty as an 80+ yr old woman has never been done and will likely never be seen again . the writing on this show was first rate and a cut above everything we see in comedy these days. Very rarely do we see the stroke of genius this show has.

 I watch these with everyone, My Mum, My Friends, My husband , the show is a laugh attack from start to tearjerking finish. There are so so many amazing episodes it's very hard to pick one .... the one with them all doing Chicken Little as a play comes to mind , the one where Dorothy finds out she has Chronic Fatigue is another ( Right on to those involved with this it's very special to me ) The ones with Sophia's Sister in them were great, Dorothy's wedding, Sophia's Choice, The Pilot , so so many its hard to pick one , but I think Mid Winters Night's Dream would be near the top of that list. If anyone hasn't bought this you are missing out on a lifechanging expirience in comedy and wonderful dvd set. When I opened the package and found that the box was Sophia's Purse I was hysteric with laughter....its a very special touch.  The one thing I would have liked was a blooper real because I know there were tonnes and they were great, but the special features aren't that bad.

Individually, they run for about 20-22 on Amazon and other websites. Sure, I could wait until they go on sale, but if you are a fan and haven't purchased the dvds, why would you want to wait to buy them a little at a time as they go on sale? Also, if you do the math, each individual season comes out to 15 dollars each in this box set, which is still 5-7 dollars cheaper than the retail price for each season. So they're not really scamming you in my opinion. Sure, if you have the seasons, there would not be any reason to buy this, but to all the critics, I disagree that it's just a profit gimmick.

My only complaint is about the packaging itself, which is what this review should be about. There is no doubt that any fan of the show would only be buying it for the collectors pieces.

While it is a good attempt at making a fun package to truly memorialize the girls, I feel that they could have done a little better on Sophia's ""purse"". Its really just a thick cardboard box and is not made of anything strong or any real materials. The worst part about the box is the handles of the purse, which are these cheap, fake, plastic handles that are nothing more than the same type of material that say, clamshell packaging is made out of. Very dissapointing. I suppose from far away on my shelf, looking at it would make anyone think its a real purse, but up close its kind of cheap.

Overall, I'm pleased with having all the seasons in one consolidated collection. I just wish they would have worked a little harder on the purse.",1292457600,2,1164,4.330275229357798

4230196,1,B003YKDPCI,"I have waited a long time for a true complete box set to be released.  I was very disappointed that when it arrived, I noticed that not only did it not include any new previously, unreleased footage, but it was the same DVDs that you can by 2 for $19 at Target.  Even the dates on the back of each DVD box were old.  At a minimum I was expecting an all newm cool package design and possibly some bloopers.  That would have been classic.  But alas, all I got was a poorly executed marketing idea.  I returned it immediately.

A true disappointment for long time fans of the show.  The Girls deserve better !",1291766400,51,606,4.208695652173913

4230198,5,B003YKDPCI,"Americans  are famous for making unfunny comedies  (especially films) but this  TV series  was  a classic  when originally released and it is still the funniest ever TV show from America. If you are having a depressing day just watch any episode of this  classic show  and  it will  help  your depression disappear. Be thankful , be very very thankful that the  truly woeful Golden Palace series  is not included. That series should have been handed over to the inquisition so that it could  be burnt at the stake. To have included it would have severely detracted from the  masterpiece that Golden Girls is. All screenplay writers should be made to  watch this series  and learn how comedy should be written instead of us having to endure the  rubbish that  generally  passes for comedy  today.",1286496000,5,795,4.7835820895522385

As a true fan, you already have these discs and like someone else said can get them much cheaper elsewhere.  I would have shelled out the Cash if this collection had new bonus features or included Golden Palace. But nothing is new except for the handbag and cards.  No thanks.

4230203,5,B003YKDPCI,"At last!
We have been joking about it for years and here it is FINALLY!
A complete series set shaped to Sophia's bamboo purse!

All the discs, all the extras in one package!

If the studio included an extra ""Bonus"" disc with this package then all the fans would be mad because we already have bought all the individual season sets!

We are looking forward to the GOLDEN PALACE Season set as well! Vote for it on TVSHOWSONDVD !",1281312000,7,426,4.367088607594937
4230204,5,B003YKDPCI,"This special set is being issued to help celebrate the 25th Anniversary of THE GOLDEN GIRLS.  The show ran from 1985 to 1992, earning legions of fans worldwide.  An unexpected smash for NBC, THE GOLDEN GIRLS told the story of four older women living together, and happily growing old disgracefully, in Miami.  Brainy, self-assured divorcee Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur), sultry, sex-mad Southern belle Blanche Deveraux (Rue McClanahan), sweet, simple-minded St. Olafian Rose Nylund (Betty White), and Dorothy's acid-tongued mother Sophia (Estelle Getty), on the run from Shady Pines Retirement Home.

This complete series set sadly won't feature any new bonus content (the only special new things will be a deck of novelty playing cards and the packaging, designed to resemble Sophia's trademark wicker purse).  So in essence those who've already purchased the individual season sets won't have a great reason to double-dip unless you really want the purse--which is quite a novelty for the hardcore fans.

Extra features varied throughout the seperate season sets, but here's a quick run-down for those who didn't buy them:

Season 1 - A fashion commentary feature hosted by Joan and Melissa Rivers
Season 2 - ""Go for the Gold"" Interactive Trivia Game
Season 3 - ""Golden Moments"" montage, ""Golden Girls"" Interactive Scrapbook
Season 4 - ""Top Ten Guest Stars of Season 4"" countdown
Season 5 - Audio commentaries for key episodes, hosted by Bea Arthur, Betty White and Rue McClanahan
Season 6 - Excerpt from a 2006 cast/crew reunion Q&A held at the Museum of Television & Radio
Season 7 - ""Thankyou for Being a Friend"" retrospective with Arthur, White and McClanahan

It's hard to imagine a more perfect sitcom (save perhaps ""I Love Lucy""), in terms of how the writing, humour and performances never seem to become dated.  It's still as fresh and vital as it was during the original run.  How many sitcoms give you serious belly laughs, re-run after re-run?  This show does! THE GOLDEN GIRLS will always be in my Top Five favourite sitcoms; these ladies have truly endeared themselves and I can't see a week through without playing at least one or two episodes.

Now, how about DVD releases for ""The Golden Palace"" and ""Empty Nest""?  C'mon!  I want a COMPLETE ""Golden Girls"" set!",1281225600,114,2277,5.037333333333334
4230205,1,B003YKDPCI,"In November 2004, Buena Vista released the first season of ""The Golden Girls"" on DVD and followed up in a timely fashion as the seventh and final volume graced store shelves in February 2007.

Now, just in time for the upcoming 25th Anniversary of the series' debut, they have put together a deluxe Complete Series set.

Folks, this release is strictly a cash-grab for Buena Vista trying to profit from the untimely death of Rue McClanahan earlier this year, as well as the current (but deserved) surge in popularity that Betty White is enjoying, and the quarter-century series milestone.

While this is a ""Complete Collection"", most fans have already purchased the individual seasons years ago. To make matters worse, those volumes are readily available at a clearance price-point (around $10 each) several times a year at your local WalMart or discount retailer when they have their DVD blowout sales. Why would anyone pay over $100 when they can buy 7 complete season sets for around $75?

Some may sing the praises of the ""collectible packaging"" but do we really need something in the shape of Sophia's handbag? It has been my experience that this type of packaging for complete series sets is cheap, flimsy and very susceptible to wear-and-tear.

Only the most rabid GG fan would consider shelling out this much for the other ""bonus"", a deck of playing cards with each of the Girls' faces on them.

The DVDs themselves contain no additional bonus features besides what already appears on the season sets.

Sorry, but the studio missed the boat on this one. If they really wanted to make this a special release to get fans salivating, they should have included all episodes of the inferior but highly-sought-after ""Golden Palace"" spinoff and some new bonus features, like perhaps the out-of-print Lifetime Intimate Portrait on all four ladies.

Five Stars for the show itself. As far as this set goes, No Sale!",1281139200,109,1914,4.922360248447205
4230206,5,B003YKDPCI,"""The Golden Girls"" will always be one of the greatest TV sitcoms ever broadcast on network television. Not only was it a Top 10 show six out of the seven seasons it originally aired on NBC, but it went on to enjoy enormous success in both syndication and cable airings, and the individual season sets sold in huge quantities.

 Now, ""The Golden Girls-The 25th Anniversary Edition"" comes to DVD with all 180 episodes uncut on 21 DVD's along with all the bonus features that were included in the DVD season sets. The bonuses include a great feature called ""Thank You For being A Friend-A Look Back With The Golden Girls"" and interviews with Bette White, Rue McClanahan, Beatrice Arthur, and Estelle Getty from the Museum of Television and Radio. Unfortunately with this new DVD edition, which is being released to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the series (it debut on September 14, 1985), there are no new bonuses. Fans were hoping the studio would release episodes from ""The Golden Palace"" that aired after ""The Golden Girls"" was cancelled in 1992, but alas this is not the case. What you do get, however, is beautiful packaging made in the mold of Sophia's famous purse, along with all the episodes. If you haven't bought any DVD sets of this wonderful series snap this gem up. Even if you bought the individual sets buy this edition: the price is excellent and I am sure this will be a collector's item in time.

 One interesting tidbit of information: ""The Golden Girls"" was the only TV series, along with ""All in The Family"" and ""Will and Grace"", where the entire lead cast received Emmy's for their work.",1281052800,62,1612,4.705673758865248

4230210,5,B003YKDPCI,"I am not going to be original and just say that The Golden Girls (1985-1992) is pure gold of the sitcom. This is the show about four women, three in their late 50s, and one - octogenerian but not many showhs would compare with the brilliance, fun, laughs, good jokes, catchy one-liners, great pacing, sparks, the perfect casting, the unique chemistry between the Girls  - the rare fun that every one of 180 (yes, every one) episodes of the show is. The show about the women who may have passed the primes of their lives but still are funny, sexy, full of life, beautiful, vibrant, and value the gift of friendship, is a winner. The casting of four highly talented actresses as four friends sharing a house in Miami, Florida back in the 1980s proved to be the real gold. Sharp and no-nonsense Dorothy (Beatrice Arthur, RIP), naive beyond belief raised on the Minnesota farm Rose (Betty White, the last surviving  Golden Girl), Southern belle Blanche, fun loving and much more fun having namesake of another less fortunate Blanche(Rue McClanahan, RIP), and Dorothy's Sicilian mother Sophia (Estelle Getty, RIP), the coolest, sharpest, funniest 80+ mom TV ever known,  are all equally fabulous and bring to every scene of every episode wit, class, humor, and talent. What fascinates and touches me - The Golden Show is equally interesting and appeals to both men and women, to the young ones and well... the golden ones :) because it is - simply one of its kind and it mixes funny and touching, serious and hilarious, satiric and sentimental in perfect measure and balance. I have problems chosing my favorite girl. I wish all of them were my personal friends and I want to thank THEM for being the best TV friends.",1276128000,2,1712,4.738255033557047

  To  be  quite  honest, when I first received this item  I thought it was counterfeit. I  was expecting to get a jacket cover for each season.  The cover looked like it had been copied and pasted. Instead I got all the discs in plastic flip pages.
  I am on Season 3 and have not encountered any major problems.  The clarity and sound of the picture has been good so far. The only problem, I had was accessing a bonus feature on fashion of the show, I think in the Season 2 last disc. I highlighted but it never showed that part.

First they are very compressed versions of the originals ordered from the US (The regular are dual layer disks, these are single layer with the same exact movies), so the quality is less.  Next, like I said there are playback issues with at least half of the disks.  I don't think it is scratches, etc..  It is the way they were pressed at the factory (factory?????).  No visible scracthes, and if you make an exact copy of the disk (no copy protection on them), the problem exists at the exact same place.

Seeing as how it was ordered for me I don't know who to get in touch with, whether any of the other discs are going to be problematic (it is a 21 disc set!), and whether or not I'll be able to get an exchange or if they will even work.

That said, save yourself some trouble and go out to a store and buy the seasons individually. At least then you'll have a better chance of them working properly. You may even save money in the end that way. I just want discs that work!",1265414400,47,1135,5.168478260869565

These are all fine actors, but I suppose I take issue with their constant moralizing and righteous posturing.  Too many portrayals of the current social issues, Hollywood-style, of their time.  When looking for entertainment, I despise being lectured by people who make their living pretending to characters created by other pretentious Hollywood writers. Frankly, I never could stand the character of Sophia.  No terms of endearment, here.  There were some funny elements, but severely, redundantly over-projected.  Like many sit-coms, even with several years' production, the characters seem static.  They do not benefit from their encounters and experiences.  They do not grow.  Only their hairstyles and colors change, as do their outrageous wardrobes.  What the hell were they hiding with those garments?",1528329600,,965,5.541095890410959
