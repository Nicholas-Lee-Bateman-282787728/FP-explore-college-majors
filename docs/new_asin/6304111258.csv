779703,5,6304111258,"""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" was released in 1939, in glorious  Techniclor. This was the same year, of course, as ""Gone With The  Wind,""  ""Good-bye, Mr. Chips,"" and others. However, while  those films have become somewhat dated, ""Robin Hood,"" remains  ageless in its swashbuckling, rollicking story line, it's unparalleled  cast, and it's appeal to all ages. A must see for anyone interested in  movies that told a story with characters that involved the audience, and a  tremendous climax that moves even the most jaded of viewers. Five times  five stars for ""The Adventures of Robin Hood.""  END",906508800,,598,5.072164948453608

His vibrant portrayal of Robin Hood remains unmatched in the annals of movie making, and every time he appears on the screen he seems to absorb everyone and everything around him. This is the art of film making at its best; this is Errol Flynn as we like to remember him; this is a must-see for all ages.  END",891561600,,492,4.52808988764045

779952,4,6304111258,"The Adventures of Robin Hood, 1938 film

In 1191 King Richard the Lion-Heart went to drive the infidels from the Holy Land. He appointed his trusted friend Longchamps as Regent instead of his brother Prince John. On his return King Richard was captured by Leopold of Austria. There is a death penalty for killing the Kings deer. Sir Robin saves his servant. The Normans hail Prince John for his support. There is a new tax on the Saxons. Sir Robin supports the Saxon people, he brings the deer to Prince John. Prince John asks for 150,000 gold marks to ransom King Richard. Sir Robin speaks against Prince John. There is an attempt to capture Robin, but he gets away on a horse. Others pursue him but he escapes. Prince John orders Robins lands confiscated and Robin condemned to death.

There is a dispute over crossing a stream, settled by quarter-staffs. There is a meeting in Sherwood, Robin organizes a resistance to fight for a free England. Robin and his men meet Friar Tuck, who joins up. They plan to ambush Sir Guys party and take their treasure. The loot is shared by Robins men, there is a feast. The coins and valuables will be sent to ransom King Richard. Poor people share in the feast. Robin explains to Maid Marion. Their guests depart. Prince John complains about their failure. They plan a scheme to trap Robin by an archery contest. All but two are left. The Tinker wins! But he is captured. A gala festival is planned, a cart brings Robin to the scaffold. Then he escapes! Later he visits Maid Marion, who offers to help Robin.

King Richard returns incognito but the Bishop recognizes him and tells King John, who plans to kill Richard. Maid Marion plans to warn Robin, but is caught. Maid Marion speaks out. Her servant warns Robins man. King Richard reveals himself to Robin and his men; they proceed to the castle with the Bishop. There is a confrontation at the coronation, King Richard reveals himself! There is fighting. Maid Marion is rescued. King Richard banishes his brother from his kingdom, and pardons the outlaws of Sherwood. Robin is promoted to Baron of Locksley, Earl of Sherwood, and given the hand of Maid Marion. [Will they live happily ever afterward?]

The legends of Robin Hood go back centuries to 1377 in Piers Plowman. The stories reflected the wishes of the people of each age. This version has the people wishing for relief from high taxes and oppression. Unhappy are the people who need a hero? Are things different today?",1523750400,,2473,4.691244239631336

I used this, and the Richard Greene series of Robin Hood TV shows, to help my kids better understand the Middle Ages in a fun way.  A surprising number if topics arose that either they asked about or I pointed out, including the feudal system, the differences between serfs and Freeman, rights (or none) of women, the code of chivalry, nobles, lords, barons, the powers and influences of the king and the Church, integrity vs. the corrupt, travel rights and permissions, the conniving machinations of the sheriff and the excuses he made to try to hide them, and of course, the beloved Friar who lovingly looked out for the villagers: educating them and protecting them from the corrupt.  We enjoyed it and the shows thoroughly, and learned even far more about many more topics of life in the Middle ages than I had even hoped.",1520812800,,893,4.639240506329114

The movie tells a love story in a very simple and direct way, with no irony and no insincere emotion. The honesty and simple goodness are a great pleasure to watch.

For example, Robin wants to rob the rich, pay the poor and defend the Saxons not against all Normans, only the bad ones: ""It's injustice I hate, not the Normans.""

A truly adult movie and one my kids loved as well.

780155,5,6304111258,"One of the most delightful action films ever made.  It's 1191 and King Richard (the Lion-Heart), stuck in Jerusalem on a Crusade, has left England in the care of his avaricious brother John (Claude Rains).  Common people and Saxons are brutally treated by the King's Norman minions, but the green-clad Robin Hood (Errol Flynn) arranges a slight case of intervention among one of John's traveling nobles, establishing that he is the champion of the impoverished common people and of his fellow Saxons.  He also makes the acquaintance of a noble lady (Olivia de Haviland) who has no initial use for Robin, thinking him a mere outlaw, but that's about to change . . .

THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD (1938) was one of the most popular movies of the 20th Century and why not?  It's a non-stop Technicolor festival of fun, action, and entertainment.  Errol Flynn personifies dashing youth and daring, and the supporting cast includes such stalwarts as Ian Hunter, Alan Hale, Basil Rathbone and Una O'Connor.  Just between us, the history is pretty muddled (there was no particular ethnic strife between Normans and Saxons by the late Twelfth Century, and Richard did not return to England as indicated), but when a movie is this much fun, who cares?

This is the apex film for Errol Flynn ... the role all his other roles are measured against. If he wasn't already typecast as a swashbuckling hero (and he was) this film would do the job. It was a label that Flynn fought long and hard to distance himself from, but never truly did.

With the immortal legend of Robin Hood faithfully portrayed by a wonderful cast, this is a must see film, and one that the whole family can watch ... something rare to find in films made over the LAST forty years.

The blu-ray presentation is solid. I was not as blown away by it as I was hoping to be, as sharpness seemed to be lacking just a little bit. However, the colors are rich.",1503360000,,940,4.390804597701149

Also, the epic swordfight between Robin Hood (Errol Flynn) and Sir Guy of Gisbourne, the Sheriff of Nottingham (Basil Rathbone), is one of the best and most famous duels in movie history.

780323,5,6304111258,"This 1938 color film does not appear old in any way. The images are clear. The action is great. It is filled with fun.
It is 1191 in the film. King Richard led his troops to Israel to drive out the people he considers infidels, meaning Arabs, because they are not Christians. He hands over the Regency of his kingdom to a man he trusts, not his brother John whom he does not trust and whom he considers treacherous.
John gathers Norman barons and instigates means to seize the throne from Richard. When he hears that Richard has been captured and is being held for ransom in Austria, he sees a double opportunity. He can force the Saxons to give money for Richards ransom and keep the money for himself, and does all he can to assure that Richard does not return to England. Thus begins a battle of Normans against Saxons. The former mistreats the latter in many ways, including killings, maimings, burning of homes, and the like. As a result, many turn to Robin to help him fight the Normans.
Marion, whom Robin comes to love and she him, is a Norman and Robin needs to win her to his cause. The film is filled with humor, almost as if Robin would rather have fun than fight.",1496793600,,1176,4.3744292237442925

780431,5,6304111258,"An utterly magnificent release of an utterly magnificent movie.  Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, 1938, Technicolor, great script, great score, great acting (yes, even Flynn) and great...everything else.  There's loads of bonus stuff on Disc 2 including Flynn's movie Cruise of the Zaca and various other bits and pieces too brilliant to remember here.  What I would say is this: Don't ever DARE tell anyone you have a DVD collection unless THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD is in it.  If you don't, then you offend all DVD collections that have taken the trouble to include this film in themselves.  It's brilliant, and then some.  Miss de Havilland, who never looked less than amazing, looks twice as much so in this.  She was as made for Maid Marian as Flynn was formed for Robin.  Mention must be made of Claude Rains, Basil Rathbone, and Alan Hale.  No reason, just mention them.  Please buy this DVD - even better, look up the Blu Ray and buy that - the film will look about three times as good but I'm not sure if all the bones features are on it. x",1486425600,7,1052,4.547872340425532

780433,4,6304111258,"To me, this is Errol Flynns signature film. He is the titular character, home from the Crusades to find Englands Norman rulers oppressing his fellow Saxons. Certainly there were difficulties between the two but Ive never understood how King Richard gained such a positive reputation in the stories. He barely spent any time in England  perhaps that was it? Anyway, this version of the legendary story sees quite a few of the traditional elements of Robins story retold. I guess this was one reason why it appealed to so many, though some developments are very unlikely. Flynns flash and style helped carry it all off and, it was a product of its times. So, it's not as gritty or imaginative as more recent offerings but theres plenty of action and as it's Hollywood, the good guys win. 3 1/2 stars",1485475200,,797,4.692857142857143

While I do enjoy other versions of the classic tale for various reasons, I feel that this version brings a little something extra. Glamorous costumes, elaborate sets with rich details, a flawless cast, an expertly written script, and the list goes on. It's such a pleasure to watch Errol Flynn play the outlaw Robin Hood, bringing to life the playful, spirited, charming character from the original tale. The lovable scamp that is Robin Hood also has a romantic side, as we also see in the film. The chemistry between Flynn and the lovely de Havilland is breathtaking to watch.

780742,2,6304111258,"The Blu-ray version is not that good. Here are the PROS and CONS.
.
.
ADVANTAGES
.
1. The colors were bright and vivid, especially the costumes.
.
2. Some areas exhibited realism. For example, the viewer was able to see the folds and creases on the clothing. You can also see the individual links in chain mail of the military men. Most impressive was Prince John's satin shirt. The tiny gold embroideries were detailed.
.
3. The wooden chairs had minute carvings. The different tones, splinters, and blemishes showed realistic wear.
.
4. The castle walls had texture, sandy grain, and different tones. The irregular shades on the large stones implied evidence of hand carving and construction.
.
.
DISADVANTAGES
.
1. Closeup facial features were soft and unrealistic. Maid Marian and Robin Hood's faces looked smooth and without pores and blemishes. These features were totally unrealistic because they were too perfect. As a comparison, Blu-ray closeups of the major characters in THE SOUND OF MUSIC and WESTSIDE STORY showed brown spots, moles, pimples, and hair stubs - things that makeup could not hide.
.
2. The various backgrounds were too grainy, especially the sky and exterior castle walls.",1469059200,,1200,5.005

They don't make 'em like this anymore. Actually, they never did...witty dialogue, exquisite costumes & the simplicity of the plot.

A great example of Errol Flynn's over the top characterization; his pleasure in his own physical exuberance makes him the perfect Robin Hood. Flynn's readiness to jump out of trees leap onto horses swing across rooms on chandeliers, & sword fight like a demon forms the core of the film's fun. Robin Hood's enemies are the essense of urbane & articulate evil. The pacing isswift & clean. & the editing is surprisingly modern. The only lapse into the corniness symbolic of this era occurs when Robin throws his chin into the air & laughs -- ""Ah ha ha ha ha"" However preposterouse it is still charming.  The one dated & glaring lfaw: the singing Will Scarlet is unbearable...dressed like a circus clown, cloyng and annoying, but it's only one guy in a cast of hundreds.

While this DVD release is great, it can't really compare to the experience of seeing Flynn in all his glory on the big screen.  What makes this DVD great are the wealth of special features included, such as an informative documentary on the making of the film, a vintage short subject featuring archery expert Howard Hill (although there is some debate on the subject, he is reputed to be the guy who split the arrow in the archery tournement sequence in the film),  and an other short, ""The Cruise  of the Zaca"".  This is a fascinating look at the off screen Flynn on a seagoing odyssey he undertook  in the mid forties in the Caribbean.  And of course, the great Warner Brothers cartoons with the Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck take on the Robin hood legend.
Any fan of Errol Flynn or  classic Hollywood film making  will find hours of enjoyment in this product.  I can't recommend it highly enough.",1464998400,,1014,4.521978021978022

It isn't gory, overly violent, or silly.  Having it on blue ray in HD  is like being able to see it at the movie theater.  I grew up on black and white TV, and didn't have  good color TV until I was an adult.  Now I own a 65"" 4K TV and wow, what a picture.  From my perspective, this movie and its kin are the basis for the fun modern swashbuckler's like Pirates of the Caribbean.  I also have other Robin Hood's:  Kevin Costner's, Russell Crowe's, Men in Tights and Disney.

781154,5,6304111258,"Although the ""Robin Hood"" story had been adapted for the screen several times before, notably the Douglas Fairbanks version, it was this one that set the standard for every one that followed, from the costumes, the character's physicality, and especially the swordfighting, which wasn't surpassed until ""The Princess Bride"" nearly 50 years later.  There are a few remarkable scenes; one where a group of men are climbing a tree simultaneously had me rewinding to watch it a few times, as I'd never seen anything like it, and the shadow swordfight at the end was a great device.  Overall, the direction is uniform throughout despite the change midway through filming from William Keighley to Michael Curtiz, and Errol Flynn inhabits the title role so completely as to define it for all time - any other ""Robin Hood"" will either attempt to copy Flynn, or will parody him; there's no other option.

The film's central theme is Saxon resistance to Norman tyranny; Robin Hood is presented as a Saxon nobleman who, like the signers of the Declaration of Independence, risks what amounts to his ""life, fortune, and sacred honor"" to lead the Saxons of Nottinghamshire against the injustices, cruelties, and oppressive taxation of the Norman overlords.  This very American theme is given far more prominence than the potentially communistic one of ""robbing the rich to give to the poor"" that Robin Hood is generally associated with.  The film is very much a product of its time, and an example of how each generation reinterprets this classic story.",1445126400,,1540,5.023529411764706

781242,5,6304111258,"Through the different variations of Robin Hood that have been produced over last few decades, the myth of Robin Hood has grown in awareness in western culture.  It is easy to admire a character who stands against injustice and the darker side that human morality has to offer.  Someone who is so altruistic that it is not always needed to have a motivation to do the things that he does.  This depiction of Robin Hood falls into that vein.

 The year was 1938 and swashbuckling-style movies were a popular genre within the Hollywood system.  This influence can clearly be seen throughout this film. (More on that later)  The movie holds true to the popular myth of Robin Hood including Prince John as the antagonist, the classic Robin Hood allies (Little John, Will Scarlet, Friar Tuck etc.), Maid Marian as love interest and so on.  It includes classic scenes
 such as Robin Hood and Little John dueling with staffs on a log bridge over a river, an archery contest used as a trap for Robin Hood and Robin's Merry Men living the good life in Sherwood forest.

 While all of the familiar elements of the Robin Hood myth in place, the film does have it's own feel to it.  It does have the swashbuckler feel to it and you could take Errol Flynn's take on the character and put him on a pirate ship and he could definitely act the part. While this facet doesn't take anything away from the character it is worthwhile to note as it was a popular take on characters during this period.

 Olivia De Havilland's take on Maid Marian is quite expected.  It is through her eyes that we see the arrogance, flair and unpredictability that surrounds the Robin Hood character.  Robin is able to win her heart through his altruistic actions.  She seems to have more of a character arc than Robin does.  This storytelling practice wasn't uncommon during this era as the protagonists tended to not have any flaws.

 The antagonists are rounded out with Basil Rathbone as Guy of Gisborne and Claude Rains as Prince John.  They both give excellent performances as two people who rely on each other in order to ensure Prince John's claim to the crown.  These two are not your standard bad guys who are bad for the sake of being bad.  The motivations are made clear for their evil deeds.  The film also features background information regarding the Normans and Saxons which helps to illustrate why Prince John feels that his cause is pure.

 The movie is fast paced for it's time and I found that it could still hold a viewer's attention.  Though we have seen many renditions of Robin Hood, this film set the standard on what it is to be a merry man.",1440288000,,2628,4.55982905982906
781243,5,6304111258,"Exciting and brilliant movie. Great performances break-neck speed direction and a production design that's simply outstanding.

781365,5,6304111258,"OK, forget about Errol Flynn's green tights and pageboy hairpiece--admittedly difficult obstacles to overcome but not entirely impossible--and, Doug Fairbanks notwithstanding, you get the most swashbuckling hero in the history of movies.

In fact, ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" from 1938 may be the most exciting retelling of any vintage legend ever filmed, an almost perfect blend of adventure, romance, and high good humor.  That it took so long after the introduction of DVD for the film to make it to disc was a remarkable oversight, but the Special Edition DVD of a few years back, then the HD-DVD, and now the Blu-ray edition help make up for any past lapses.  Warner Brothers have done up the film wonderfully well, with a fully restored and remastered print and good, high-definition video.  A swashbuckling adventure is more than ever a swashbuckling treasure.

Clothing and hair styles aside, ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" is as nearly perfect a costume action drama as one could hope for.  Flynn was the perfect leading man, with a supporting cast equally distinguished; the directors, two of them, keep the pace moving along at a healthy clip; the scenery and costumes are sometimes breathtaking; and the musical score, art direction, and editing all won Academy Awards.  If the romance seems just a bit stilted today, it's the film's only minor drawback.  This is mostly fun for everyone, young and old.

I mentioned Doug Fairbanks, who essayed the Robin Hood role earlier, but Flynn eclipses even the great silent-screen star in his spirited daring-do.  Although Flynn said the role bored him, no one could handle a sword, fly from a chandelier, or charm a lady quite like Flynn, who came to the part after playing similar roles in ""Captain Blood,"" ""The Prince and the Pauper,"" and ""The Charge of the Light Brigade.""  What's more, you might say he led a similar role in real life insofar as his charming the ladies was concerned.  People didn't invent the term ""In Like Flynn"" for nothing.  As a movie hero, Flynn couldn't be better:  Tall, slim, dashing, impossibly handsome, and unlike a certain boy-next-door American who portrayed Robin more recently, Flynn was an Australian, born in Tasmania, who had lived in England and had a proper accent, a characteristic not lost on Mel Brooks when he made ""Men in Tights.""  One can hardly imagine the studio's first choice, cocky little Jimmy Cagney in the part, but serendipity struck when Cagney was unavailable and Flynn stepped in.  The world has been safe for swashbucklers ever since.

The supporting cast is no less felicitous.  The beauteous Olivia de Havilland plays the beauteous Lady Marian, coy, flirtatious, and a year away from the much more prime Melanie in ""Gone With the Wind.""  Basil Rathbone is the consummate villain, Sir Guy of Gisbourne, the actor also a year away from his most famous continuing role, Sherlock Holmes.  Here, Rathbone is the very epitome of the evildoer and every bit the match for Robin.  Warner Brothers standby Claude Rains is the corrupt and somewhat effete Prince John, trying his best to usurp the throne in the absence of his brother, King Richard the Lion-Heart.  Eugene Pallette is the Friar Tuck I grew up with, and he's still the only person I can picture in the role.  Likewise, Alan Hale is the only Little John I can imagine, a role he played in three different motion-picture versions of ""Robin Hood"" (although people today may be more familiar with his son, Alan Hale, Jr., as the skipper in ""Gilligan's Island"").  Melville Cooper plays the comically sniveling High Sheriff of Nottingham, and Ian Hunter is the noble Richard.  Patric Knowles as Will Scarlett is the odd-man-out, never quite establishing himself so indelibly in one's mind.  The studio had wanted David Niven for Scarlett, but he was unavailable.  Our loss.

William Keighley was the original director of the film.  He had directed Flynn in ""The Prince and the Pauper"" the year before, and WB expected big things of him.  However, when the rushes began coming in, the studio felt the action scenes lacked requisite zip; so they brought in veteran Michael Curtiz, who had directed Flynn in ""Captain Blood"" (1935), ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936), and ""The Perfect Specimen"" (1937), to take over.  They were right; Keighley did fine with some of the dramatic encounters, but Curtiz was ideal managing the derring-do.

Warner Bros. made most of the picture on their back lot, as we might expect, with the big soundstages utilized to their fullest for things like the banquet scene.  But the outdoor settings in Sherwood Forest needed a more convincing aspect, and WB found it in a number of Southern California locations and one Northern California spot, Chico's Bidwell Park, the second-largest municipal park in the country.  If you ask a Californian what they know about the little town of Chico, the respondent is apt to mention the State University, Bidwell Park, and Velveeta.  Don't ask; Google Chico and Velveeta.

Then there were the Oscars, well deserved for the film's music (Eric Wolfgang Konngold), art direction (Carl Jules Weyl), and editing (Ralph Dawson, who may be as responsible as anyone for the movie's fast action and excitement).

A trivia note from John Eastman in his book ""Retakes"" (Ballantine, New York, 1989):  ""His (Flynn's) frequent tardiness on the set annoyed cast and crew, and most of his speaking scenes had to be reshot several times because of his bad memory for dialogue.  With costar Olivia de Havilland, who had carried an unrequited torch for him for three years, he teased and bantered, kissing her far more ardently than the censors would pass, thus requiring more retakes.  Flynn's habits provoked constant arguments between himself, director Michael Curtiz, and studio chief Jack Warner, who wanted to fire him but was tied by contract--fortunately, for the film became a minor classic.""

Whether or not you're familiar with this particular ""Robin Hood,"" you'll find everything here you always remembered about the legend:  Robin's fight with Little John, Friar Tuck's rotund rascality, the rescue from the gallows, the romance, the swordplay, and the famous splitting of the arrow, a feat reputedly done with almost no special effects.  ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" is, indeed, the quintessential movie swashbuckler.

Video:
Several years before this Blu-ray release, Warner Bros. had fully restored the film, eliminating age marks, scratches, lines, spots, and flecks, correcting the color, and issuing the results first in a two-disc Special-Edition set and then in HD DVD.  The 1938 movie was among the earliest to use three-strip Technicolor, and thanks to WB's restoration the image looked almost as good in SD as it probably did when it was new.  I thought the colors were a little bright, but they were still fairly natural and realistic.  My only serious concern about the standard-definition transfer was a somewhat soft object delineation and a degree of grain in darker scenes and against wide, flat backdrops.

In direct comparison to these two earlier versions, the dual-layer, Blu-ray BD50 edition, using what appears to be the same VC-1 transfer as the HD DVD, slightly sharpens and clarifies the SD image, making the standard-definition rendering look all the more soft and blurry.  There are still moments of softness in the high-def edition, but it looks remarkable for a movie of this vintage.  Colors in high definition are as brilliant as ever, with blacks and reds remarkably deep, as are the royal purples, dazzling golds, and gleaming whites.  The great feast in Sherwood Forest is one of the most-colorful, most-impressive visuals in the film.  One can continue to find grain, though, as one should, considering that the grain is native to the original print.  Even if the grain is never severe enough to mind after the first few minutes of viewing, it does add a touch of roughness to the image.

And what do you mean, Is it in widescreen?  The movie is over seventy years old.  Interestingly, however, I measured the opening titles at 1.37:1, the film's original screen ratio, but the body of the movie at about 1.47:1.

Audio:
On the SD and HD DVD discs I found the Dolby Digital and DD+ single-channel monaural sound a tad hard, thin, and edgy, with a hint of background noise in quieter sections at higher volume.  It's the same for the BD's Dolby Digital 1.0 sound.  Korngold's dazzling musical score could still use more mid and lower bass to fill it out, as well as more frequency and dynamic range (although the trumpets ring out boldly at Nottingham Castle and quite dramatically).  What's more, the Dolby Digital sound is exceptionally clear, making dialogue easy to understand, even if voices are a touch pinched and nasal at times.  Background noise seems as prominent as ever, but as with the film grain, one hardly notices it a few minutes into the movie.  Remember, this was 1938, little more than a decade after the introduction of sound to pictures.  Given the circumstances, the audio comes off as well as one could expect.

Extras:
The bonus items on this Blu-ray edition duplicate the materials found on WB's two-disc Special Edition and HD DVD, and they are quite formidable, several of the items in 1080p high definition but most in 480 standard resolution, and in total time lasting over twice as long as the main feature.  First, there is an audio commentary by film historian Rudy Behlmer.  It can be a little dry, as though he were reading a script to a college film class, but his remarks contain an abundance of substantial details, and they really are fun to listen to.  For example, he mentions that if you watched the film on television any time before the mid 1960's, as I did, you would only have seen it in black-and-white.  It was only in the mid-to-late 60's that Warner Bros. released the Technicolor version to TV.

After that is a Warner ""Night at the Movies 1938,"" introduced by Leonard Maltin that includes a vintage newsreel; a musical short subject from Freddie Rich and His Orchestra; a Merrie Melodies cartoon, ""Katnip Kollege"" (HD); and a theatrical trailer for another Warner hit of the day, ""Angels With Dirty Faces.""

Moving on, we find two fairly recent documentaries.  The first is sixty-minutes long on the coming of color to the movies.  Called ""Glorious Technicolor,"" it is the story of the evolution of the Technicolor process, divided into chapters for easy access and hosted by Angela Lansbury.  The second documentary, ""Welcome to Sherwood: The Story of the Adventures of Robin Hood,"" is a sixty-fifth anniversary affair on the making of the classic, with historians, writers, and film buffs Rudy Behlmer, Leonard Maltin, Robert Osborne, Paula Sigman, and Bob Thomas, Korngold expert John Mauceri, and art director Gene Allen.  It's fifty-five minutes long and takes the viewer through every stage of the film's production from casting to final screenings.

Further, there is an eight-minute series of outtakes (without sound) also narrated by Rudy Behlmer, plus a segment called ""Breakdowns of 1938,"" a studio blooper reel that provides fourteen minutes worth of flubs from various films of the period.  ""Robin Hood Through the Ages"" is a seven-minute look at Robin Hood's earlier screen adaptations, most particularly the 1922 Douglas Fairbanks silent film.  Then there's ""A Journey to Sherwood Forest,"" thirteen minutes of on-location, behind-the-scenes home movies made during the film's shooting.  Two classic Looney Tunes cartoons follow that parody Robin Hood:  ""Rabbit Hood"" (HD) with Bugs Bunny and ""Robin Hood Daffy"" (HD) with Daffy Duck.  Then, there are some vintage short subjects, ""Cavalcade of Archery"" and ""The Cruise of the Zaca,"" followed by a gallery segment called ""Splitting the Arrow"" (HD) that includes historical art, costume designs, scene concepts, cast and crew pictures, and the like.  An Errol Flynn trailer gallery includes trailers for twelve Flynn movies.  And, finally, there are three audio-only bonuses:  ""The Robin Hood Radio Show"" from 1938; some Erich Wolfgang Korngold piano sessions; and a music-only track highlighting the film's Oscar-winning score.

The Blu-ray edition comes with English, French, and Spanish spoken languages; English, French, and Spanish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.  In addition, there are twenty-nine scene selections (but no chapter insert) and pop-up menus.

Parting Thoughts:
Critics called ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" a ""...splendid adventure story, rousingly operatic in treatment"" (Leslie Halliwell, ""Halliwell's Film Guide""), ""Cinematic pageantry at its best"" (""Variety""), ""One of the most splendid entertainments ever devised"" (David Shipman, ""The Story of Cinema""), ""The quintessential swashbuckler"" (Steven H. Scheuer, ""Movies on TV""), ""The definitive swashbuckler"" (""Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide""), ""...THE Robin Hood"" (John Eastman, ""Retakes""), ""Among the very best adventure films"" (Mick Martin and Marsha Porter, ""Video and DVD Guide""), ""The stuff of which Saturday afternoon dreams were made"" (Scott Meek, ""Time Out Film Guide""), and ""...the greatest costume adventure of all time"" (Danny Peary, ""Guide for the Film Fanatic"").

781684,5,6304111258,"""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" is a true Golden Age classic, resplendent in its Technicolor lushness. The characters in this version of the tale come closest to our collectively-imagined platonic ideals, especially Errol Flynn's cheery, almost elfin Robin: hands on hips, head thrown back in laughter, betighted legs dangling from a tree branch. Even on a first viewing, the film has a familiar quality. Not because it is derivativeit bears little resemblance to its best- known predecessor, a colossal silent epic starring Douglas Fairbanksbut because it is iconic. It is also efficient: a less than 100-minute romp and romance slickly produced and directed by Hal B. Wallis and Michael Curtiz (who would later helm Casablanca.) At so brisk a pace, almost every moment is occupied with either derring-do or rapid-fire dialogue. The technical pieces and the thrillingly real, non-computer-assisted stunts all come together around the perfect cast, and the result is an indelible, definitive image of the Robin Hood myth that is funny, romantic, and exciting. It set the bar that revisionists have gone around and imitators have gone under, but none have yet topped. As a side note, it is the only Robin Hood film yet recognized with a Best Picture nomination, and it won Oscars in three categories.",1423267200,3,1298,5.185714285714286

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Oh how I do love The Adventures of Robin Hood film? And here is why: there's the incredibly dashing Errol Flynn in one of his signature roles; the unbelievably alluring (yet always chaste) Olivia de Havilland, simply a vision of grace and spunk; the eye-popping Technicolor palette which I regularly show to those unfamiliar with classic Technicolor to prove to them colours were more beautiful ""back then"" and last, but certainly not least, the beyond rousing, Oscar-winning score of Erich Wolfgang Korngold, which layers theme upon theme to bring out the subliminal hero in all of us. And that's just for starters. I have loved this film since the first time I saw it, decades ago, and my love for it has only grown in the intervening years. It may not be deep, and at times it is patently silly, but I for one don't think classic Hollywood has ever fashioned a more complete entertainment than The Adventures of Robin Hood and that is why I developed a true appreciation for film classics of this genre.

When I was first introduced to this 1938 Technicolor swashbuckling film, 'The Adventures of Robin Hood,' from then on I fell in love with this awesome film. Seventy-odd years on, it still holds up splendidly as high octane adventure, a soaring love story and good old-fashioned popcorn entertainment. So what if the sets look slightly phony, the costumes slightly goofy, and the dialogue sounds slightly old fashioned? Today's big-budget, effects-laden snooze-fests would kill to earn even a tenth of the laughs, thrills, and swoons that this little baby manages, seemingly without even breaking a sweat.

Errol Flynn was the perfect leading man. Though he was quoted later as having been ""bored"" by the role, after achieving stardom with earlier, similar efforts like 'Captain Blood' [1935] and 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' [1936], you wouldn't know it from his performance. No one could charge into a room, swish a sword and charm the ladies like he could and they didn't coin the phrase ""in like Flynn"" for nothing. So iconic is Errol Flynn's Robin Hood portrayal that it is parodied in satires, especially like Mel Brooks' 'Men in Tights.'

The supporting cast is also really wonderful. Olivia de Havilland is a gorgeous, sly, and feisty Maid Marian. Flynn was reportedly a bit of a troublemaker on set, reserving most of his goodwill only for Olivia de Havilland. Whatever the case, their chemistry is palpable on screen, winning, and rather sexy. Basil Rathbone, the world's most famous Sherlock Holmes, is wisely cast against type as the villainous Sir Guy of Gisbourne. His performance is consummate in its wickedness and subtle wit, with Basil Rathbone easily holding his own against Errol Flynn. Also look for a terrific ensemble of famous character actors, including Melville Cooper as the hilarious, snivelling High Sheriff of Nottingham. On top of all that, Warner Bros. stable standby Claude Rains as somewhat fey Prince John, and Alan Hale, Sr. (a dead-ringer for his son, future 'Gilligan's Island' skipper Alan Hale, Jr.) as Little John.

It's interesting that 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' continues to be considered the definitive telling of the classic tale, because based on the behind-the-scenes dramas that plagued its production; it should have been a disaster. William Keighley was the original director, hired mainly because he had worked with Errol Flynn a year prior on 'The Prince and the Pauper.' Despite the studio's high hopes, his early dailies were underwhelming, and he was promptly replaced by another director, Michael Curtiz. Veteran of such hits as 'The Perfect Specimen,' 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' and 'Captain Blood' (the latter two again with Errol Flynn), Curtiz's influence helped give the film its now famous light-hearted spirit and dazzling derring-do. 'Robin Hood' certainly ranks up there in a career filled with staggering achievements.

Ultimately, even those familiar with the Robin Hood character but unfamiliar with this particular version, will find something to love here. The film leaves nothing of the legend out, the splitting of the arrow, the fight with Little John and the Sherwood Forest feast, not to mention the swordplay, the romance, and the plundering... it's all here in spades. 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' may not have modern special effects, airbrushed models instead of actors, and fast-cut editing, but even seventy years on, it remains cinema's reigning swashbuckler.

Blu-ray Video Quality  'The Adventures of Robin Hood' I really enjoyed on an old fashioned NTSC DVD release that was at the time magnificent. Restored under the auspices of the ""Ultra Resolution"" process, this technological wonder allows for clean-up and re-alignment of vintage Technicolor negatives, returning them not only to their former glory but far surpassing any previous presentation in terms of clarity, colour purity, and sharpness. The results of Warner Bros. advancements have earned praise far and wide, and I'm certainly a huge fan. I continue to be amazed at how fantastic the recent Warner Ultra Resolution titles like 'Singin' in the Rain,' Gone with the Wind' and 'The Searchers' look, and now 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' can be safely added to that list. The only reason I'm not giving 'Robin Hood' a full five-star video is because it may be just a smidgen less perfect, and not quite as sharp, as the absolute top tier of Warner's Ultra-Resolution titles, and the title I still hold up as the absolute reference-standard, 'Singin' in the Rain.' But despite the minor quibble, 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' looks totally fantastic.

Blu-ray Audio Video  Due to the age of the audio elements, and the lack of the original ""stems"" needed to create a full 5.1 surround remix, 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' is presented in 1.0 Dolby Digital Mono, as with the NTSC DVD version, there just isn't much you can say about this mono mix. Overall, fidelity is fine. The most apparent improvement is the high end, gone is that shrill, ear-piercing flatness one usually associates with old mono mixes. Mid-range and low bass could still have used a bit of a boost, however. This is most noticeable on the brass-filled music score, which sounds rather flat. Dialogue holds up very well, though, if somewhat pinched. But like the image, any deficiencies in the audio are hardly excessive, and after a few minutes, you won't even notice. But a word of warning, put your amplifier setting in the STEREO mode, as if you have it in the Dolby Surround mode, it sounds totally awful, I just wish with this awesome Technicolor film, they could of spent some extra money on upgrading the sound to at least 1.0 DTS-HD Master Audio.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' was a fantastic package even on the old fashioned NTSC DVD, with hours and hours of bonus materials. It's just as impressive here on this Blu-ray, especially with all of the same materials, but presented in 480i video image, that are of very high calibre. Whew  what a package!

Special Feature: Alternate Viewing Mode [1080p] Let's start with the 'Warner Night at the Movies"" option. This allows you to watch the film in the context of a film theatre programme, as it would have been exhibited at the time of its original release. Introduced by the ubiquitous Leonard Maltin, this option precedes the film with a Vintage Newsreel; a musical short subject from Freddie Rich and His Orchestra; the Merrie Melodies cartoon ""Katnip Kollege"" [1080p] and a theatrical trailer for 'Angels with Dirty Faces.' It's a very fun way to kick off the movie, and a terrific addition from Warner Bros.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by film historian Rudy Behlmer: His name should be familiar to any fan of classic cinema, as he's contributed to numerous DVD supplements and documentaries. Admittedly, his track here can be a little dry. He's so well prepared he seems to be reading off of already-written material. But you can't argue with the breadth and depth of his knowledge. He sticks to the movie at hand, and covers just about every aspect of the production, from conception to casting to shooting to release. Perhaps this is not for casual viewers, but diehard fans of the film shouldn't miss it.

Special Feature Documentaries [480i] Two full-length documentaries are also included. ""Glorious Technicolor"" runs 60 minutes and is hosted by Angela Lansbury. It's a fascinating, very well-produced history of the Technicolor process, from its glory days in the '30s and '40s to its slow and painful demise, by the end of the '60s, it was all but dead, which I think is very sad. Another nice bonus from Warner Bros. the documentary has its own chapter search function. Very handy.

Special Feature: Welcome to Sherwood: The Story of 'The Adventures of Robin Hood [2003] [480i] [4:3] [55:00] Welcome to Sherwood: The Making of The Adventures of Robin Hood [2003] takes us behind the scenes during production of the Warner Bros. classic - from the development of the script to the fight choreography. You'll also learn more about the history of the Robin Hood legend and what prompted Warner Bros. to make The Adventures of Robin Hood. In addition, we learn how close James Cagney came to bouncing around Sherwood Forest in green tights instead of Errol Flynn and what happened to the horse Olivia de Havilland rode in the film and why two men are credited with directing the film. The documentary includes colour home movie footage of the cast and crew on location plus interviews with film historians such as Rudy Behlmer, Bob Thomas, Leonard Maltin and Robert Osborne. One thing the documentary doesn't go into is the relationship between Errol Flynn and director Michael Curtiz. In all the two men made 12 films together, including The Charge of the Light Brigade and Captain Blood and the film that made Errol Flynn a star. Despite their long history and the string of hits they made, they hated each other.

Special Feature: Video Archive [2003] [480i] [4:3] A huge archive of historical material begins with a clutch of rare and never-before-seen footage. Rudy Behlmer returns to narrate an 8-minute series of Outtakes, plus ""Breakdowns of 1938,"" a 14-minute studio blooper reel. Both are without sound.

Special Feature: A Journey to Sherwood Forest [2003] [480i] [4:3] [13:00] This is an assemblage of on-set footage and home movies made during the film's production.

Special Feature: Robin Hood Through the Ages [2003] [480i] [4:3] [7:00] Offers a brief history of Robin Hood's earlier screen adaptations, most notably the 1922 Douglas Fairbanks silent version.

Special Feature: Audio Archive: [2003] There are also three very impressive audio-only supplements. ""The Robin Hood Radio Show"" from 1938 is just that, and is quite a bit of nostalgia. Though I'd never heard this actual radio programme before, because it was mainly heard on American Radio and not here in the UK. Also included are a few outtakes of Erich Wolfgang Korngold piano sessions. Best of all, is a complete music-only track of the composer's OSCAR winning score. As was the case with the feature, the audio here is presented in Dolby Digital Mono as well.

Special Feature: Still Gallery: Splitting the Arrow [2003] [1080p] Presented in full 1080p video is the ""Splitting the Arrow"" animated still gallery. I counted over a hundred stills, ranging from historical art and costume designs, to scene concepts and cast and crew photos. This one is very easy to navigate with your remote's basic control functions.

Special Feature: Warner Bros. Shorts: Next up are four different short films and cartoons. All are presented in 1080p video image. Sit back and enjoy the Looney Tunes classics, which are as follows:

Vintage Warner Bros. Cartoon: Rabbit Hood [1949] [480i] [4:3] This cartoon is the origin of the infamous ""knighting"" exchange, where Bugs Bunny is dressed up like a king, and proceeds to pound the skull of the Sheriff with his sceptre while dispensing an oddball title with each strike. The short was directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese. As usual, Mel Blanc picked up all the voice characterisations. The layouts were done by Robert Gribbroek and the backgrounds by Peter Alvarado.

Vintage Warner Bros. Cartoon: Robin Hood Daffy [1958] [480i] [4:3] The film features Daffy Duck in the role of legendary outlaw Robin Hood, and opens to the strains of his playing a song on an instrument similar to an arch lute or bouzouki. As he prances along singing, he trips and tumbles down a hill still singing, off a bank and into a river. Directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese. It was the last Chuck Jones theatrical cartoon to star Porky Pig.

Then, there are two vintage short subjects, which are as follows:

Vintage Warner Bros. Short: Cavalcade of Archery [1946] [480i] [4:3] Master Bowman Howard Hill displays his remarkable skills in a Technicolor Cavalcade of Archery. Seven years after using his talents to great advantage in the classic swashbuckler The Adventures of Robin Hood [1938], Howard Hill once again steps in front of the cameras in this enjoyable, light-hearted little film. Although the silly narration sometimes intrudes, it never obscures what Mr. Hill is able to do with his arrows to a variety of targets, including bottles, a gourd, an apple and even a prune. Often overlooked or neglected today, the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents, both in front & behind the camera. The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film, something akin to writing a top-notch short story rather than a novel. Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material, short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios' feature films.

Vintage Warner Bros. Short: The Cruise of the Zaca [1946] [480i] [4:3] Cruise of the Zaca is a short documentary on 16mm about a trip taken by Errol Flynn in 1946 on his boat the Zaca to collect specimens with his father, Professor Flynn. The trip was done in association with the Scripps Institute of Oceanography of the University of California and took place off the east coast of Mexico and in the West Indies. Errol Flynn leaves his house on Mullholland Drive by helicopter captained by Paul Mantz and goes to the Scripps Institute. He goes on board the Zaca and visit San Benito Island, the Panama Canal and Jamaica. The trip started in August 1946. On board were Errol Flynn, his father, his wife Nora, and John Decker, Howard Hill, Professor Carl Hubbs, Charles Gross and Jerry Corneya. After a month of sailing, many of the group left, including Flynn's wife and father, but Flynn pushed on through the Panama Canal to the Caribbean to Cap Haitien. Before going through the Canal, Errol Flynn stayed in Acapulco where the Zaca had been hired to appear in The Lady from Shanghai [1948].

Theatrical Trailers [1080p] The fun finally comes to an end with an Errol Flynn Trailer Gallery, featuring spots for 'The Adventures of Robin Hood,' plus the aforementioned 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' and 'Captain Blood.'

Finally, 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' is a lively, rousing adventure. Sure, it's from 1938, with plenty of silly costumes and hairstyles, but who cares when it's so much fun? This Blu-ray is magnificent. Warner Home Video continues to impress with its Ultra-Resolution re-masters and the video transfer in particular is a stunner and there are so many extras here it could take you days to get through them all. If you are at all a fan of Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men, then this Blu-ray is an absolute must-own. For a film that features beautiful lush colours, vivid pageantry and thrilling performances, that today can be hard to come by. The special features alone provide a delightful peek behind the curtain into a time when cinema began to shine its brightest. The Blu-ray of The Adventures of Robin Hood does justice to celebrating the frivolity that is Robin Hood Hollywood style, especially with the very charismatic Errol Flynn at its helm and again when I first viewed this film I feel in love with it 100%, as I think it is the best portrayal of this type of genre showing the ye olde history of England in that period and hasn't been bettered and now I have the ultimate version that I have now added to my Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!

It portrays the original story, free of any modern distortions, with all the characters and events intact. Also, the cinematography, color, and sets are all excellent, especially for the time period in which it was made. The lavish sets & costumes are comparable to DeMill's ""Ben Hur"" & ""The Ten commandments"", and the action is the best. One example is the scene where Robin Hood first appears, in the King's dining hall, strutting in dramatically with a deer slung across his shoulders, dropping it on the table in front of all the villains at the feast. This is only one of many. This is a true Oldie But Goodie, a real keeper in every way. A great addition to any action-adventure video library. Errol Flynn at his swashbuckling best.

782872,5,6304111258,"Errol Flynn is at his top form here, one of the best adventure films of the era, a real favorite of mine and the HD transfer is excellent, the source material was a limitation but transfer is nice, the colors are fabulous and over the top, the way Technicolor process was supposed to look in the 1930s. There is barely any visible grain or dust, this is a great transfer. The monaural audio is far less promising, while clear and serviceable it is not processed for the average home theater, it is in the left and right tracks, not center which loses some quality for the average home theater watcher. The sound field is so narrow it is almost compressed voices do not pop and can be lost in the other sounds resulting in a more muddy field. Definitely well worth watching and hearing, but the sound techs could have done a better job cleaning up and re mixing the audio to make a much better product.

Flynn's dashing Robin Hood plunges into every act of derring-do with a zestful twinkle in his eye and often a playful word.  This film has probably the greatest sword fight ever filmed, pitting Robin Hood (Flynn) against the haughty Sir Guy (Basil Rathbone, who had formidable fencing skills in real life).  Claude Raines is the suave and scheming Prince John.  All in glorious Technicolor.

The restored technicolor version is the most crisp and stunningly vibrant I have ever seen, and the special features really offer the fan a treat by giving great behind-the scenes information about the creative team who made the film. Not only explaining the mindset of the actors, director, studio head, and so forth; but explaining what scenes they had planned to do but scrapped for cost. Very, very interesting and worthwhile for movie fans, and filmmakers both newly minted and experienced.

783083,5,6304111258,"Released in 1938, The Adventures of Robin Hood was the top box office film of the year. A major part of its success was due to the full-color ""three-strip"" Technicolor process, a technology that would secure its hold on the viewing public the very next year with The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind. Robin Hood was lavish entertainment, with heartthrob Errol Flynn as Robin and Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian. A host of fine actors contributed to this film, including Claude Rains as the treacherous Prince John, Basil Rathbone as evil Sir Guy of Gisbourne, Eugene Pallette as Friar Tuck, and Alan Hale as Little John. In a casting of some note, Marian's horse was portrayed by Trigger, the palomino of Roy Rogers fame.

Although utilizing numerous stage sets, Robin Hood also incorporated outdoor scenes from California parks for Sherwood Forest. The cumbersome Technicolor cameras had to be trucked into the field, but the vivid colors and Technicolor's resistance to fading over the years made the awkwardness worthwhile. Needing intense light for filming, Technicolor required that ""night"" scenes be shot in daylight, then darkened in the lab. But the darkening could not conceal the fluffy daytime clouds, or the sharp shadows.

In the climactic confrontation between Robin Hood and Sir Guy, watch as Errol Flynn pursues Basil Rathbone through an open doorway inside the castle. Outside the doorway Robin's sword is noticeably bent, but once through the doorway it is straight.

Old color films benefit greatly from a high-definition restoration, and they don't come much older than this one. It retains the ability to entertain even today, 75 years after it was made. The restored Blu-ray video is superb, the monaural sound is clean and functional.  Given its classic story, great cast, and place in Hollywood history, this movie is a worthy addition to a film fan's collection.",1378598400,2,1893,5.0576923076923075
783084,5,6304111258,"Errol Flynn's performance in the title role has thrilled audiences young and old for decades. His uninvited appearance at a dinner at Nottingham Castle honoring Prince John (Claude Rains) alone stands as one of the great entrance scenes of all time. As the outlaw Robin of Loxley, Flynn is brash, brave and loaded with charm, and despite his rather dainty costumes, he's a man's man. Because of these qualities, I think The Adventures of Robin Hood belongs among the movie classics for children -- particularly growing boys -- because it conveys important themes for them within the context of a fictional story. Yes, there was a King Richard the Lionhearted, and there was a Prince John, but there was no Robin Hood, and the lives of the real Richard and John turned out quite differently than portrayed here. This is no history - it's wish fulfillment, produced with all of the skills Hollywood's movie factory (in this case the Warner Brothers studio) possessed. It's the way you'd like things to turn out, which is why the story packs so much emotional punch when Richard finally returns to England. It's also a fine morality tale for children. There's heroism, humor, honor, courage and loyalty. There's also cruelty, deceit, cowardice, and treachery. It all shows without subtlety how good and evil people contend in this world. Set in England in the 10th century, the movie was shot entirely in California in glorious Technicolor, with a rousing score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Its look and energy remain undimmed, and Flynn's Robin Hood is the best ever.

When our young neighbor, (he's 4 years old) decided HE was going to be Robin Hood, I asked his parents, what made him come to this important decision? They said he just finished watching Robin Hood on the telly, and he IS Robin Hood. I quickly remarked:""AWWWW Errol Flynn at his best!"". They had NO idea what I was talking about. They had shown their young son, the ""Disney"" version. I told them, I had a copy of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" with Errol Flynn and  Olivia de Havilland !

783146,3,6304111258,"When reviewing old movies like 1938's ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", the reviewer must decide whether to critique the movie based on the era in which it was released or solely upon one's modern viewing experience. I'm going to largely review this classic version of Robin Hood according to the latter.

I do like Errol Flynn in the title roll. He exudes such a joie de vivre (""joy of living"") in contrast to Costner's dour performance and Crowe's dead serious approach. Flynn's rendition comes across as a Medieval superhero with superhuman nonchalance and bravery, not to mention fighting skills. One sequence shows Robin Hood taking on a whole castle of armed foes and easily escaping. I have no problem with this -- superheroes are great -- but it does mark the film as more of a Medieval fantasy rather than a quasi-realistic historical picture.

Olivia de Havilland is also great as Maid Marion. She has a lovely face and such a winsome spirit. The pompous villains are excellent as well. As for Robin's merry men, they're serviceable.

The film is very colorful and energetic, but sometimes the dialogue comes across so rehearsed. The characters speak so quickly and without inflection that it often doesn't even register what they said until a few seconds after they speak. Maybe it's just the way actors delivered their lines back then but, regardless, this'll strike modern viewers as bad filmmaking and acting.

One scene is very eye-rolling -- when Marion comes into Robin's camp in Sherwood forest and his merry men start dancing hand-in-hand. Alrighty then.

As far as the score goes, I'm sure it was fine for 1938, but for modern listeners it's verging on atrocious.

Still, it's surprising how much ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" holds up and remains entertaining. It's a great film when you want a pleasant flash from the past. But it doesn't hold a candle to more modern Medieval films, like ""Tristan & Isolde"" and ""Black Death"". And Costner and Crowe's more realistic versions are all-around better, even while they're less vibrant. But, again, the 1938 version is great when you're in the mood for a more energetic and colorful viewing experience.

The film runs 102 minutes and was shot in California (they do a pretty good job of trying to make Southern California look like England).

783209,5,6304111258,"Robin Hood is justifiably famous as an entertaining swashbuckling epic that the family can enjoy.  It is a fine example of film magic produced in the late 1930s and like its counterparts The Wizard of Oz and the more dramatic Gone with the Wind, it employed color.  Errol Flynn excels as Robin Hood while Olivia DeHavilland and Basil Rathbone provide excellent supporting roles.  The stunt work is generally quite good with a very well choreographed climatic sword duel between Flynn and Rathbone (ironically in real life I understand Basil was probably a better fencer).  Overall I highly recommend ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" to classic movie fans.",1371600000,,653,5.074766355140187

Errol Flynn makes me want to giggle with his joie de vivre. His performance in sword fights (even with occasional stunt men) is mesmerizing and his romantic scenes are delightful. I had a little fun with it the last time I watched it I noticed the bangles on his tunic and Will Scarlet's outfit.  I devilishly wondered if they stopped at a boutique on the way to Sherwood. I could go on about the sound track. It is magnificent. The cast is excellent. Just right for each character.

There are also a good amount of special features on the making of the film & various other things. More than I thought they would have. I am really glad I got this on Blu-Ray.

Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe's Robin Hoods are ok, but can't compete with this movie at all. Errol Flynn is fantastic as Robin Hood and Alan Hale Sr. is the best little John I have ever seen. With bad guys Claude Rains (Prince John) and Basil Rathbone (Sir Guy of Gisbourne) this movie truly has an all star cast. And don't forget Olivia De Havilland as Maid Marian, you could not ask for a better or more beautiful actress! If you have never seen this movie then you need to check it out.

However.. Amazon Prime video app on the PS3 (and perhaps other platforms) could use some work.

It is a few minutes to suspend your disbelief and the movie will last in your memory for a lifetime.  With the thousands of remakes of this great ""fairytale"", this one remains my favorite.  Basil Rathbone is the perfect villain in Sir Guy and the sword work was jerky, but, hey filming was not a perfect science at that time.  It was the triumph over tragedy and good over the evil, Prince John.  History may not write these men as they are in this move, but, just watching Claude Rains as the Evil Prince John, makes it all worth while.  They are the great actors whom Derek Jacobi and Sir Laurence were to be and they learned from the best.  Love, Hope, Joy and the triumph over evil, with a ton of laughter in each line.

Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland are the perfect combination for Robin and Marion in this fun family-friendly film.

783640,5,6304111258,"As far as film versions go, ""The Adventures of Robin Hood""  is THE ONLY ROBIN HOOD!  A very large part of this is due, of course, to the wonderful performance of Errol Flynn as Robin.  With the twinkle and energy resplendent in his portrayal of the mythical nobleman turned outlaw, he gives this character a sparkle consistent with the best retellings of this tale, a sparkle that I think no other actor of his time could have contributed so successfully.

Well matched by the beautiful Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian, and ably assisted by Claude Rains as the evil Prince John, Basil Rathbone as the murderous Sir Guy, Alan Hale as the jovial and hulking Little John, Eugene Pallette as the gravel voiced Friar Tuck,  and a host of other venerable supporting players, Errol Flynn in this film reached for and landed perhaps one of his best performances in a long and sometimes checkered acting career.

This ambitious 1938 production, one of the first shot in the newly arrived 3-Strip Technicolor process, was masterfully co-directed by top Warner Bros. directors William Keighley and the always solid Michael Curtiz.  The script is fast moving, the themes are adventure and romance, and the period production design is amazingly near flawless.

This 2 Disc Special Edition presents a glorious Technicolor print, and the DVD extras are gratifyingly full of wonderfully interesting production tidbits,  on-the-set home movies, a very interesting documentary on the origins of Technicolor narrated by Angela Lansbury, etc.  Within these extras, for example, you will find out that cowboy star Roy Rogers' famous horse Trigger first had his debut in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" as Maid Marian's steed, and that his given name (before Roy renamed him)  was something like Golden Cloud.

In summary, this is a wonderfully complete DVD presentation, and a very worthwhile acquisition for anyone who again wishes to see and feel an on-screen fulfillment of perhaps one of the most colorful and magical dreams of adventure and romance yet filmed.  This, my friends, is truly THE ONLY ROBIN HOOD!",1345248000,,2095,5.055232558139535

I mean don't get me wrong I enjoyed the disney's version, laughed at mel brooks version, and others......yeah won't go into them. However this version I feel truly represents the fun, the adventure, the excitement, and the romance of Robin Hood.

This Blu-ray copy is fantastic, I thought it all looked fantastic on screen, the extras were interesting and love that they put Rabbit Hood and Daffy Robin Hood cartoons from that time as well.

There has been three Robin Hood motion pictures made since this one, but this version is more playful and less fierce than those that have followed.

783758,5,6304111258,"They will always make epics but they never again will make epics like they did in the 1930s and 1940s and especially Swashbuckling Epics like The Adventures of Robin Hood.  This 1938 classic epic release by Warner Brothers, staring Errol Flynn as Robin Hood and Olivia De Havilland as Maid Marian as well as Basil Rathborne as  the evil and villainous Guy de Gisborne  and Claude Raines  as Prince John  is what definitely is  an influence on the creation of all the Pirates of the Caribbean Movies as well as all the Star Wars films when dealing with Sward Fighting.
This Movie is a Fairy Tale epic with Robin Hood as the hero and Maid Marian as the girl in the tale that is smitten by the hero and who ends up with him. There is comedy when Robin and Little John as well as the Merry Men lour Friar Tuck into their group, and also when the bungling fool of the Sheriff of Nottingham is in any scene as well as in any scene where Robin's man Much is with his love interest Nurse Bess.
Sadly there is also tragedy in this Film. with pain being seen in the tortured faces and broken bodies of the Saxon people of the England of Robin Hood's time supposedly set in this tale. The cruel and evil Gisborne and the backstabbing and devilish John Lackland {as he is called in the Movie although later on in the real John the First of England's life he was called that way by his enemies} are the none comic villains in the Movie that would give anyone nightmares.
Later in history John is forced by the Nobles to accept the Magna Charta at the Field of Runnymede, but at the time that this tale is set those later on Nobles united against King John were at each other's throats. Richard Coeur de Lion {Lionheart} was the only one that in the tale is who would have all Nobles and all English united, as he was the King in the tale but he is held hostage in Austria; and that gives John the opportunity for him to take Richard's throne. Richard the Lionheart was a King who was a Warrior as well as a Crusader, with him being so absent in his reign that it was no wonder that such injustice was placed on the people in the tale, who were tortured and maimed and who lost everything because of the pact of evil, in between John and his supporters of Gisborne and the Sheriff of Nottingham.
In this Film Richard returns to England as it is told in so many Fairy Tales of him in total disguise as a Monk and Richard states to a mysterious Monk that he is mad at Richard abandoning his people, with him and all Merry Men seeing that this Monk was Richard and Richard befriending the Merry Men and their leader as loyalists to him despite Robin's long anger at Richard's not staying home.
This makes the tale a story where so many issues are mentioned when at the same time the art of fencing is so present as the action and especially when it is in the form of a Ballet. The Music is just as amazing as the Movie itself with Erich Wolfgang Korngold being such a maestro.",1309046400,,2959,4.265597147950089

783762,2,6304111258,"This is easily one of my top ten favorite films. Maybe even in my top five, which is why this new blu-ray edition was so disappointing.

The film's transfer is frustrating to watch. It vacillates wildly between grainy, speckled, soft, and finally the pristine look that one normally associates with blu-ray.

Now, I know what some of you may be thinking, that I simply don't ""understand"" how film grain should look in the new format, and I'm talking through my hat on the subject. While grain may look different on a hi-def trasfer, there are points (notibly in the opening scene where the town crier reads the news of King Richard's capture), where the grain looks almost like static.

And some sequences are overly soft, if not almost blurry. We aren't talking about a limited understanding of Digital Noise Reduction on my part, we're talking about a slapdash job of processing the master.

Worst of all is that throughout the entire picture, there are white speckles that come and go in varying degrees, but almost always present, interspersed with pristine scenes, usually close-ups of the characters. It honestly reminded me at times of an old VHS master!

In fact, I suspect this bad mastering is the reason the disc is relatively inexpensive. I swear, this couldn't the master Warner Bros meant to use. Perhaps it was the one used for training their technicians, and it slipped through into production by mistake.

Sound and color are both good. Extras are fair for a low priced disc such as this. But for now, until this classic is revisited properly for blu-ray, your best bet is to stick with the excellent two disc DVD release from a few years ago.",1304985600,3,1660,4.7665505226480835

I was surprised the first time I watched this Blu-ray to see scenes I had never seen before, despite watching the movie countless times on television over the years. The other major surprise is the color, which is eye-popping in this restored version. Early color movies such as this one went for color in a big way and man is this one colorful. Again, most TV versions are faded and bear absolutely no resemblence to the original. Some might even argue that the colors are overdone and garish. But you have to understand the context of the movie. Early color TV shows suffered from the same issue. Color was new then so they wanted to give you COLOR. And man, they did. The vivid color palette used in this movie is just amazing. Of course, the movie itself is a joy, perhaps the best Robin Hood ever. No one can beat Errol Flynn in the title role and there is no better villain than Basil Rathbone. Add in marvelous cinematography  (the shift between the actual characters and their shadows in the climactic swordfight is classic) and a wonderful score and you get one the best classic action movies of all time.",1303689600,,1256,4.557522123893805

Directed by Michael Curtiz

Based on the well-known English legend, Robin of Locksley is a noble who is forced to become an outlaw when Prince John the usurper tries to take the throne from his absent brother. He flees to Sherwood forest where he gathers together his Merry Men and is called Robin Hood. He begins to rob the rich and give back to the poor, the townsfolk that are heavily-taxed by the Sheriff of Nottingham. Meanwhile he still has to defend the throne, and woo Maid Marian.

Undoubtedly the best of the best!

But I was hoping that by now it would included a deleted scene from the movie that I remember from the movie. It's just after they rescue Robin hood from his hanging. They all arrive back to there place and Robin ask them how they came up with this plan and they told him it was all of Maid Marion idea and Robin is deeply touch and becomes aware of her mutual feeling for him.

The 72 year-old film (as of this posting) has been well preserved but at times there are moments of softness and flickering in the image, especially in the first half of the film (like the early banquet scene that Robin Hood party-crashes). It's not abundant throughout the film but it is noticeable in the brief shots where it occurs. Otherwise, stellar presentation. The Ultra Resolution restoration process produces great detail and vibrant colors (Olivia De Havilland looks delicious in high-def).

783923,5,6304111258,"Now this is a Movie with a capital ""M"" from Hollywood's greatest era. Errol Flynn, the action hero successor to Douglas Fairbanks, forever defines the cinematic Robin Hood in this 1938 classic. Flynn's Robin Hood leaves all other interpretations in the dust. ROBIN HOOD is a good old-fashioned swashbuckling adventure story that has all the elements---drama, comedy, romance, action---in just the right proportions.

England is in the midst of an insurrection. Sir Robin of Locksley is a Saxon baron who is battling Prince John (Claude Rains wearing an absurd Prince Valiant haircut) and Sir Guy de Gismond (Basil Rathbone). The Norman Conquest of 1066 has displaced the old Saxon nobility. It is now 1200, and Norman-French rule is slowly being asserted throughout the countryside, mostly (but not always) peaceably.  The usurping Prince and and his henchman have seized control of the country in the absence of the Crusading King Richard The Lionhearted, and are overtaxing their subjects in order to fill their own coffers. Robin Hood, accused of outlawry, takes up residence in Sherwood Forest in order to do battle with these evil men.

ROBIN HOOD is a romantic fantasy about Good versus Evil, with a stirring Korngold score, colorful and amusing characters, corny, intentionally stiff dialogue, knights in shining armor, and a damsel in distress, Lady Marian FitzWater, played by the lovely Olivia DeHavilland, (who would go on the next year to cinematic immortality as Melanie Wilkes in GONE WITH THE WIND), insanely sexy in period costume.

This is very much a highly stylized stage play with Shakespeare-like pretensions. It's all pure fun. Heroic Robin and his Merry Men swing through the forest engaging in dramatic swordplay with one-dimensional bad guys, stealing from the rich to give to the poor, and putting their hands on their hips, throwing back their heads, and roaring with laughter---""Ha ha ha ha!""---at every opportunity. Whole pigs roast on spits, people are drinking mead out of horns, and lute players are doing their thing. This film has all the stereotypes (which we had never seen on film before in 1938). Everybody is wearing tights.

This film was made in Technicolor, and the vivid primary colors add a wonderful and fantastical quality to the movie. In terms of sheer shine, it even outperforms the innocent, enjoyable Disney cartoon version (which was very much based on this one). It made me wonder why they stopped using Technicolor for certain films.

Actually, watching ROBIN HOOD made me wonder why they stopped producing bright, heroic escapist action films at all. To hell with ""reality."" When I look at the Kevin Costner or Russell Crowe versions compared to this, they have no magic at all.

Want to see ""the real"" ROBIN HOOD?  Watch this one.",1286668800,2,2786,5.094298245614035

784006,5,6304111258,"Robin Hood -- In Like Flynn!

When I heard about the Russell Crowe version of Robin Hood, I recalled that there was an early version with Errol Flynn, the swashbuckler of the 1930s and wanted to check it out.

I have yet to see the Crowe version, but from the trailers I could see it was dark -- a freedom fighter who will stop at nothing for the freedom of his people -- we're talking Middle Ages Braveheart here.

Hey, how about accomplishing the same thing, but not be so damn serious about it?  We're talking an all-star cast.  The casting was just perfect.  The Technicolor (this was new technology back in the day) is very good -- the reds are bright red, the greens are deep green, and so on.

And all the stories that we relate to Robin Hood are all here:  the archery contest, the staff fight with Little John (played enthusiastically by Alan Hale, the father of the Gilligan's Island captain of the same name).  Interestingly, Alan Hale played Little John in the silent film version AND the later 1950s version.

The DVD has all the stories and then some.  The effeminate Prince John, played in a smarmy style by Claude Rains.  Olivia deHalvilland plays the Maid Marion, who at first hates this interloper, but then recovers when she sees both Normans and Saxons being bled dry by Prince John.

I won't go deep into plot here.  In short, a nobleman who was in good graces with King Richard (who went off on the Crusades and left Prince John in charge) is dismayed about what's happening to his countrymen.  There is bad blood between the Normans and Saxons and to have a united Britain, Robin of Locksley feels he must intervene.

His lands are captured by the prince.  The Sheriff of Nottingham is supposed to be the main antagonist but he is really there for comic relief.  Basil Rathbone as Sir Guy, who is just as clever and just as devoted to his purpose as Robin, is excellent as the evil, angry nobleman.  He likes his power and is not about to shirk it!

The swordplay is very good.  The scene where Guy and Robin are jumping up and down staircases, slashing and parrying, it's just a marvel to behold.  The actors were trained on sword fighting, so it was not the cut and wild swinging you will find in the silent film version.

The DVD is a masterpiece and will take hours to complete!  Robin through the ages!  Classic cartoons.  The Robin Hood radio show from 1938.  A synopsis of the film process Technicolor as told by Angela Lansberry.  Outtakes from the film never shown!

There's just so much.  Highly recommended!

OK, now where's that Russell Crowe version?  Sigh.

That said, in my view, no one has since equaled the spirit and zest of this 1938 tour-de-force brought to the screen by not only Flynn, but Alan Hale Sr. reprising his 1923 role as Little John, Basil Rathbone's (hiss! booo!) totally reprehensible Sir Guy of Gisbourne (aka the Sheriff of Nottingham), Claude Rains (yecchhh! ugh!) as slimy and devious Prince John, Eugene Palette playing that supreme gastronome Friar Tuck, and, of course, gorgeous Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marion, Robin's love interest.

than any of the previous vhs or dvds versions would be an understatement. but
i do have one or two reservations about the blu-ray disc.

1.with the film getting a thorough high def up grade i expected the audio tracks
  to have more oomph, bite etc.. than in any previous home video version but they
  don't. you have to pump up the audio to a high number to get that just right
  sound level. this is surprising since Warner Brothers Home Video also gave THE
  WIZARD OF OZ and GONE WITH THE WIND thorough high def up grades and their audio
  tracks have the oopm and bit missing from TAORH.

2.also with all the high tech digital technology available today one would think
  the picture image would be A+ stellar in all aspects, but it isn't. there are a
  few moments on the blu-ray disc that just don't look as high def as the rest of
  the film. i don't know exactly how a high def upgrade is done but i'm assuming
  they go thru the film frame by frame. so shouldn't every frame of a high def

His eyes shift to the guards by the doors -- not with fear or hesitation, but anticipation!""

784197,5,6304111258,"Wikipedia tells us that the story of Robin Hood has been kicking around for centures. The name itself began kicking around in 1228, but people were probably telling stories about the character for a long time before that.

There's been many iterpretations of the Robin Hood story, including several on film which have varied from poor action adventures (Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves), to weird comedies (Robin Hood - Men in Tights), to an animated version (Disney's Robin Hood), that probably has most furries creaming their jeans.

But to me the best version of the story ever made was the 1938 Technicolor classic, The Adventures of Robin Hood. It has everything you could ever want in an adventure film: a sneering villain (Basil Rathbone), a beautiful heroine (Olivia de Havilland), a dashing hero (Errol Fylnn), great sword fights, wonderful dialogue, beautiful costumes, amazing sets, and an all around feeling of lighthearted joy and delight!

You know the story: Robin of Locksley goes out to stop the evil Prince John (Claude Rains), and his henchman, the Sherif of Notingham. Along the way he teams up with his Merry Men (including Little John, played by Alan Hale Jr, enters an archery contest, and wanders around with the kind of smirk Johnny Depp nearly managed to imitate in Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl.

There's several things that make this a great film. First, it's insanely entertaining! It's never slow or dull. It has brisk pacing that never lets up. The cinematography is well-done and fascinating to see, given that it was one of the first Technicolor epics (though you might go a little blind from the bright colors). The writting is sharp and clever. Even the music is everything you'd want from a movie like this! But the real gem here is the acting.

Consider the by-play between Robin and the Sheriff, or Robin and the Prince, or Robin and Maid Marion or, hell, Robin and a brick wall! Errol Flynn had this magical sort of charisma that forced you to pay attention to him every time he was on the screen and to be happy you were doing so. He brough a casual ease to his characters in movies like Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk. He's so important to The Adventures of Robin Hood that it's basically impossible to imagine the movie without him, how much more vapid and uninteresting it would've been with just about anyone else playing the lead. It's his swaggering, his smart-ass attitude and his talent with the sword that makes him the most memorable part of this film.

This isn't to take away from the rest of the cast. A hero is nothing without a great villain and you'd be hard-pressed to find one better than Basil Rathbone, with his sneer and his (frankly superior), fencing skills, he made a worth advesary for a hero like Flynn's Robin.

The movie is relentlessly fun, light-hearted and enjoyable. If you haven't yet seen it, you're doing yourself a great diservice. Watch it and see the swashbuckler genre done to a perfection that has hardly been seen since!",1257638400,2,3026,4.741444866920152
784198,5,6304111258,"Almost everybody knows the story of Robin Hood, and what he does for a living. He steals from the rich and gives to the poor, and he does a heck of a good job (unlike Dennis Moore). And so there are numerous movies that have been about this medieval legend. We have the animated Disney version, the 1991 Patrick Bergin version, the 1991 Kevin Costner version, the 1993 Mel Brooks parody, and most recently, the 2006 BBC series. Here, we have the 1938 Errol Flynn version. This is considered to be the greatest film adaptation, and it's not very hard to see why. It looks pretty outdated in today's world, but it's still something to look forward to. There are colorful costume designs, dazzling cinematography, and an impressive music score. But the real standouts here are Errol Flynn & Olivia de Havilland as Robin Hood & Maid Marian. The critics are correct: these two people give the greatest performances in this film and, in fact, the entire universe of Robin Hood films. This is the true Robin Hood: sly and charismatic. And this is the true Marian: kind, but troubled. Forget Kevin Costner's version. This is the ultimate film adaptation.

784203,5,6304111258,"A bit about the film: it's charming.  It's colorful.  It's greenwood.  Robin's bow is Native American.  And Robin really sums up the ideology of the English/Scottish ballads, of the type of the 'fair warrior' or 'hynde child' which Robin Hood is traditionally made out to be.

The firstan weed that he drew on (weed-cloths)
It was o' the linen clear
The nextan weed that he drew on
It was a weed o' weir (war)

The nextan weed that he drew on
It was baith good iron and steel (both)
Twa gloves o plate, a golden helmet, (2)
became that hynde child weel (well)

Or:

He decked his men in Lincoln green
Himself in scarlet red
Fair of his chest then was it seen
When his silver arms were spread.

The 'Adventures of Robin Hood' is definitely (from my perspective at least) something which nobody should miss out on.  (!!!)  It inspired me at least, on my first watching some 3 to 4 years ago, to begin researching the Robin Hood legend in hopes of finding out how old he was, mostly due to a Welsh wren song I had just learned which went like this:

Ble'r ty myn, medda Dibbon wrth Dobbin
Ble'r ty myn, medda Ricart wrth Robin
Ble'r ty myn, medda Sion
Ble'r ty myn meddar nefar beyond.

'Where are you going, says Dibbon to Dobbin, Richard to Robin, Shaun, and the never beyond.  Answer: I'm going to the woods to hunt the wren!

So I noticed there was a Robin and a Shaun (Little John) and that got me started on a long trail, which ultimately owes its inspiration to this film!

There's English versions too:
(Oh where are you going said Milder to Moulder
Oh we may not tell you said Festel to Fose
We're off to the woods said John the Red Nose
We're off to the woods said John the Red Nose) and they mention Robin too ...

One of the fun points from the film would be where Robin is caught and about to be hung, and he looks around him and sees all his friends ready in the crowd.  That is from the original legend, but the story is usually preserved in Scottish songs, not English, so no idea where the moviemakers got it.

Another bit of fun is Robin's duel with Little John (great action there, but it ought to be sword, not quarterstaff) his sword-duel with Friar Tuck (which ought to be quarterstaff!) and his leaping from a tree before the bishops. (Very appropriate.)  He's King of the Woods, completely.

If you get it, I'm going to bet you'll enjoy it!  [...]",1250380800,,2368,4.3099547511312215

But BD expanded capabilities should have been used.  Even though, as expected, the movie is 4:3 it doesn't appear that any effort was made to find the best print.  This WHOLE thing, even extras, is just a copy from DVD/VHS versions.  Some of the extras have no tie overall and in fact a few are just simply filler.  The History of Robin Hood files is filmed 4:3 format in 1998.  Clearly any film prior to 1953 should only be purchased on normal DVD.  Between 1959 and 1960 one will have to see how it was shot, print used or extra content before purchasing a BD version.  There's even a web page that won't open on BD live!

I will continue to enjoy this film especially now I finally own it.  But I will be very very skeptical in the future buying an old favorite on BD disc.

784205,5,6304111258,"The ultimate Errol Flynn swashbuckler.  Olivia de Havilland in all her glory.  A milestone in Technicolor photography.  THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD is all this and more.  Based on the original Robin Hood ballads and stories, we follow Robin Hood (Errol Flynn) as he fights the corrupt rule of Prince John (Claude Rains) and Sir Guy (Basil Rathbone), and wins the fair hand of Lady Marian (Olivia de Havilland).

Warners originally intended ROBIN HOOD to be a vehicle for James Cagney, after he played Bottom in their all-star production of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" in 1935.  When he later walked away from the studio following a dispute, the part went to virtual unknown Errol Flynn who'd scored a surprise critical and financial success in ""Captain Blood"" that same year.  Olivia de Havilland, Flynn's ""Captain Blood"" leading lady, was reunited with him for what would be their second of eight wonderful co-starring assignments.

This is a movie that we really couldn't appreciate fully until the Blu-Ray release.  The BD uncovers all the tiny details in sets and costumes, like the green crushed velvet of Errol Flynn's cape, the sheen on Basil Rathbone's blue satin collar; and the ruddy complexions of the actors.  This is the exact same Ultra Resolution print that was seen in Warner's most recent double-disc Special Edition DVD set, but the upscaling to BD brings this masterpiece to life in a way that we have never really experienced before.

The stacked extras are identical to the standard Special Edition DVD release but are very worthwhile.  Highlights include the TCM documentary ""Glorious Technicolor"" narrated by Angela Lansbury which charts the history of the greatest colour film photography system; and ""Welcome to Sherwood!"", an exhaustive documentary detailing the history and production of the ROBIN HOOD shoot.",1248998400,5,1837,5.168918918918919

While the feature was a bit sharper many of the extras on the disk are not in 1080 format resulting in picture quality that is less than what you get with the 2 disk special edition. Also the disk is set to start the film on loading bypassing the menu system so you don't have the opportunity to choose to view just the feature or Warner's wonderful NIght at the Movies program.

Using the menu buttons on my remote I found the main menu and discovered it was a terrible mess. Instead of bringing over the well designed menus from the 2 disk edition, there is one huge screen full of words presented. You have to look closely to see the cursor pointing to the choices.

But perhaps the worst thing about the blu ray version is the gallery material. On the 2 disk edition these archival artworks, posters, and photographs almost fill my 50 inch screen. On the blu ray copy the screen is screaming yellow with the artwork appearing as a tiny, almost thumbnail picture in the center of the screen. Result - tiny images that are hard to see against the brilliant yellow background.

It is hard to believe that Warner Bros created this blu ray and the 2 disk edition. Blu Ray is supposed to be the superior format but Warner's Blu Ray release diminishes the wonderful work they did in the restoration of this classic film.

It would be great if Warner redid the packaging of their Blu Ray edition so that it was a better showcase for this film  That's not likely to happen so my advice to anyone who wants to own a copy of this classic film is to ignore the blu ray edition and buy the 2 disk special edition instead.",1245801600,9,1862,4.275568181818182

He's abetted by Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone who give deliciously nefarious accounts as Prince John and Sir Guy.

784398,5,6304111258,"The two-disc edition of one of the best Technicolor costume adventures ever made is superb. If you want only the best Hollywood film productions for your permanent collection, then this version of The Adventures Of Robin Hood belongs in it. Kudos to Warner Brothers for spending the time and money to get this great film just right for DVD. It's a knockout.

I grew up watching the awful edited-for-TV and scratchy 16MM classroom versions of this film classic, so the deep, clear and crisp colors, widescreen presentation and enhanced sound track of the original production were a revelation. So were the actors, who now seem newly minted and thus better able to flesh out their wonderfully compelling characters. Errol Flynn's energetic portrayal of the legendary honest robber has never been equalled. (P.S. What a handsome devil Flynn was!) Ditto Olivia de Havallind's dewy, smooth-voiced and beautifully costumed Maid Marian. Claude Rains as their scheming enemy, Prince John, is even more dastardly than I thought.

The addition of a well-researched and presented technical history of the production by film historian Rudy Belmer, along with myriad behind-the-scenes film clips and anecdotes, makes this fine entertainment even more enjoyable. I better understand and appreciate what it took back then to get everything and everybody together to make great films like this one. Thanks, Mr. B.

It is a tribute to the filmmakers that the modern-day viewer's knowledge of TAORH's technical aspects doesn't detract from the sheer pleasure of watching a splendidly told medieval tale. You keep cheering for the brave Saxon commoner and his merry band as they battle their cruel Norman overlords for king and country (and the comely Maid) with heroic derring-do -- especially when Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone are on screen. The two actors play off each another exceptionally well. Their climactic swordfight is masterfully staged and well excecuted; it is notable that few of their fight scenes were doubled by stuntmen. Let's face it: Americans can't do swords. End of story.

This DVD is first-rate: well restored, produced, packaged and presented. I'm betting that like me, you'll be watching this edition of The Adventures of Robin Hood a lot and seeing something new every time. May our swash never buckle!",1235606400,,2314,5.212365591397849

The climatic sword fight between Flynn and Rathbone was choreographed exceptionally. Both actors were well-skilled swordsmen which added to the realism of the fight.

784580,5,6304111258,"Overall, the combination of screenplay, directing, pacing, music, action, and acting make this not only the greatest screen version of Robin Hood ever, but one of the greatest all-time adventure classics. Adventure movies are no longer made, unfortunately, having been replaced by 'Action Movies.' An Action Movie is an Adventure Movie with a very bad case of ADHD, or maybe an Adventure Movie on meth, with a low IQ. Too bad, Adventure Movies were classier, and could be enjoyed by women and grown men as well as adolescent boys.

Errol Flynn as Robin Hood is probably the greatest hero in any Adventure Movie. Just perfect, and the guy did his own sword-fighting, and took lessons from an world-class archer for the shooting scenes.

Besides being great entertainment, Robin Hood is very well made from a technical point of view, but does not hit you over the head trying to be artsy-fartsy. The scene where Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone are having the climactic fight, and they slide past the camera, while the camera seamlessly catches the perfect, fighting shadows, then seamlessly they slip back into camera is just fantastic.

There is strong element of populist social commentary in this film. The poor and working people are in a state of deprivation and tyranny because King Richard has become entangled in a foreign military adventure.

My favorite part, after the climactic sword fight, is when Robin gives Maid Marion a tour of the medieval equivalent of a Hooverville. This is a movie made in 1938, and this is a wonderful way of reminding the audience, and modern viewers, of what true poverty looks like. Later in this sequence, you can see Robin and Marion gaze lustfully after each other as they eat at the same table with the homeless. For this film's original audience, hunger was never too far away.

This film blends the spirit of Romantic Adventure with a strong call to social justice. One of my top 10 all time favorite movies. I could watch it once a week.

However, I not too keen on the up beat music in this film. It sometime's sounds childish, but no matter what you might think about it, it will always be a timeless classic. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Robin Hood. No matter how cheessey it may be, it's still one of the best. It's fun, entertaining, and very adventureous. Plus, it has a Bugs and Daffy short of Robin Hood that you'll share with your kids. Not to forget some extra bouns material as well. Five Stars for this one.",1220400000,,656,4.341463414634147

He races his lines, and shows no emotional depth.  The whole movie itself races along too quickly.  Not really an accurate retelling of the Robin Hood tale.  The huge amount of extras (in HD, thankfully) make up for the flimsy storyline and acting.  This is the only movie on HD from the 1930's.  Casablanca has far better acting, but came out 5 years later, and of course was in black and white.

The action scenes are well staged but there is little in the way of blood spilled on the silver screen.  Errol Flynn does a superb job of filling the role of the hero and the other actors are also well cast and rise to the occasion.

As for my criticism, Robin seems a little too over confident at times during the situations he places himself in but I guess being familiar with the script helped Errol with this point.  For someone who can split an arrow in half with his own from many yards away it is also difficult to believe that Robin could not recognize King Richard from a few feet away.  Finally, some of the costumes seem more suited for a high school play.

If you can overlook these latter points and just going along for the ride I am sure you will enjoy this film.",1215302400,,961,4.229508196721311
784661,5,6304111258,"Warner Brothers has gone all out in theit DVD presentation of 1938's The Adventures of Robin Hood starring Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland. Robin Hood is one of the greatest examples of Technicolor film making from Hollywood's Golden Age. The great thing about this film is that at 70 years old it does not feel dated. It is an hour and forty minutes of pure escapism. What you see is what you get. There are no hidden agendas no subtexts just simple romance and swashbuckling adventure.

The film was perfectly cast with a young Flynn as the lead but kudos need to be given also to Basil Rathbone, Claude Rains, and Alan Hale. The score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold won the Academy Award that year and is still a great example of how effective scoring enhances a film experience. The direction by Michael Curtiz and William Keighley is crisp and strong.

The highlight of the presentation is Warner's selection of extras that really places the film in perspective. There is an audio commentary by Rudy Behlmer that is one of the best that I've heard. Included is  Leonard Maltin's Warner Night at the Movies 1938 which attemps to present the film as it would have been back then with trailers, short subjects and cartoons. The package includes the hour long documentary Technicolor Glorious Technicolor that gives an insiders view of the film process.

This is one of those classic films that needs to be seen and Warner Brothers is to be complemented for putting together such a great package.",1215129600,3,1496,4.764478764478764
784662,5,6304111258,"What can I add to what has already been said about this film.  But, there is some perspective I would like to give regarding Mr. Flynn.

Errol Flynn was not regarded as a good actor by many people.  He never received an Oscar but was a much better actor than he got credit for.  How many people could have played this role?  When you look at Flynn's career, Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk especially, but also his later roles, he was a very good actor who was just not given the opportunity to move beyond that style.  When he did Elizabeth and Essex (with Bette Davis), she didn't want him because she said he was not an actor.  I totally disagreed with that.  He was good.  Of course, in Robin Hood, he had some very good people around him like Basil Rathbone, Claude Rains (John Gieguld's teacher at RADA), Olivia (who was an extremely good actress besides good looking) and Paulette as Friar Tuck.

The music was great, the script was great but what made this movie was Errol Flynn.  He was the center of the picture and he carried it.  Of course, it was an ensemble picture, but Flynn was very good.  He was a natural actor.  In Charge of the Light Brigade, or even Santa Fe Trail, he was much better than he was given credit for.  I think because, like Robert Mitchum, he was never caught acting.  There are actors like that and he was one of them.  Curtiz, the director, saw this in him and it is no coincidence that he directed him in his greatest performances.

An especially good scene in the film is where Errol Flynn enters the castle in the major opening scene.  Cagney?  I don't think so.  It took someone who not only had the look but the ability to project that look from inside the character.  Not only did he do it, he did it well.

As movie historians know, Errol Flynn did not like the way he fenced in the Sea Hawk.  He took lessons and became very good.  Being a good fencer is a staple for British classical actors, but Flynn really had to learn and he did it well.  Unlike Richard Greene (who played Robin Hood in the TV series and was captain of his school's fencing team), Flynn took it to heart that he looked like an amateur next to Basil Rathbone (who was a great fencer) in his first film.

Although Errol Flynn's personal life matched his life on stage, and he died young because of his lifestyle, one only has to think of Robin Hood and know that he was born to play this role, and it would be this role that keep him alive for years after his career was over.",1212451200,4,2489,4.274089935760172

Why? First of all, the film is one of the most joyful and fun-filled movies ever made, and the best Robin Hood ever filmed. The 1938 technicolor classic was restored from its original elements, and looks absolutely pristine. The mono soundtrack was retained, as it should be.

If only the restored film was on this disc, it would be a must-buy, but the extras put it WAY over the top. How about 3 Looney Toons classics in HD? How about the option to watch it ""Night at the Movies"" style, which includes newsreels and shorts that would be shown before it originally?

784885,5,6304111258,"""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" still comes across as fresh and entertaining almost 70 years after its release.  It was nominated for Best Picture in 1938.  Carl Jules Weyl won the Oscar for the film for Best Art Direction.  The delightful look of the Nottingham Palace with the high stone walls creates the perfect period atmosphere.  Ralph Dawson won the Oscar for Best Editing for the film.  Some of the film sequences are astonishing.  The scene where the whole hall breaks into sword fight has a continual clink of crashing swords as the camera shifts from duel to duel.  Erich Wolfgang's score won the other Oscar for which the picture was nominated.

Errol Flynn's career is legendary as an action hero.  He was never nominated for an Oscar.  His personal life, particularly the statutory charges from 1942 that earned him the phrase ""in like Flynn"" could have wrecked a smaller star's career, but Flynn kept going.  He's probably in his quintessential moment as Robin Hood, flashing smiles, romantic sparks flying with Maid Marian and his constant good humor.  It's hard not to root for a hero like Robin.

I particularly like Patric Knowles as his sidekick Will Scarlet.  From the costuming that places him in brilliant red to match his character name, Knowles flashes the smile, never stealing the spotlight, but always ready to fly to Robin's defense.  Knowles had a long film career that included some gems like ""Expensive Husbands"" & ""A Bill of Divorcement,"" but he shined brightly in this action adventure.

Olivia deHaviland plays Marian Fitzwalter, better known as Maid Marian.  The costumer highlights her face in blues & lavenders.  She radiates incredible charm & grace.  The scene where she stands before Prince John and declares her disgust with his actions shows steel in her her feminine character.  Olivia won two Oscars for ""To Each His Own"" in 1946 & ""The Heiress"" in 1949.  Her role as Marian was believable.  Her loving looks let you know that Robin was one lucky man.

Eugene Pallette plays Friar Tuck.  This actor had an amazing career, acting in over 180 films!  His resume lists some true classics like 1916's ""Intolerance,"" the ghostly ""Topper"" from 1937, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" in 1939 & ""Heaven Can Wait"" in 1943.  As the portly Friar Tuck, his swordfight scene with Robin is both entertaining and hilarious.  He had a voice that sounded like a gravel road, but he was one of the actors that flourished in both the silent and sound eras.

Alan Hale Sr. who played Little John also had an amazing film career spanning from 1912 to 1950.  His films include silent era ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" from 1913 to ""The Inspector General"" in 1949.  As Little John, his burly build and contagious good humor makes him an ideal fit for Robin's band of Merry Men.

Our two main villains are both played by notable actors.  As Prince John, Claude Rains is an underhanded two-faced back-stabber.  He was nominated four times as Best Supporting Actor including for ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" in 1939 & ""Casablanca"" in 1943.

Basil Rathbone who many associate as Sherlock Holmes plays Sir Guy of Gisbourne and vows to apprehend Robin Hood.  The scene where Robin captures his entourage, takes his money & sends him back in rags is (for the audience) a joyful humiliation.  Rathbone was nominated for Best Supporting actor in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/If-I-Were-King/dp/1428016988/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">If I Were King</a>, a film based on the stage play by Justin Huntly McCarthy.  He had also been nominated for a similar award in 1936 for ""Romeo & Juliet.""  Neither Raines nor Rathbone ever won an Oscar, as good as they both were.

Two other actors deserve special mention.  Ian Hunter played Richard the Lionheart who returns home in the nick of time to reclaim his throne.  Hunter won an Oscar in 1953 for Best Original Screenplay for ""Roman Holiday.""  Una O'Connor plays Lady Marian's attending maid Bess.  Her clever comic barbs made her screen time sparkle.  O'Connor was in many other films including ""The Bells of St. Mary's"" from 1945 & ""Random Harvest"" in 1942.  Some may also be interested to note that the palomino horse Olivia deHaviland rides in Sherwood Forest later would be seen as Roy Rogers' Trigger.

The theme of Saxons and Normans getting along despite differences, the treatment of women, fairness in taxation and care for the poor give the film a thematic backbone.  As we near the 70th anniversary of this film, it deserves its place as one of the most watched & loved of the era's movies.  Enjoy!",1181865600,6,4604,4.956862745098039

784890,5,6304111258,"If there is any film that Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland will be remembered for (as screen partners) it's 'The Adventures of Robin Hood'. It has become one of the most beloved storybook films of all time--action, romance, majestic sets and music, a sparkling script with many juicy lines and all of the swashbuckling swordplay done with great flourish and style. The highlight of the many action scenes is the duel between Flynn and Rathbone as they overturn heavy tables and candelabra, all the while exchanging some blustery dialogue.

As for Flynn and de Havilland, their screen chemistry was never more obvious. Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone make a memorable pair of villains and the remarkable cast includes sterling performances from Melville Cooper, Ian Hunter, Una O'Connor, Alan Hale, Eugene Palette, Montagu Love and Patric Knowles.

It's a fairytale version all done up in gleaming technicolor, the action and romance made even more impressive by Korngold's exquisite Oscar-winning score. The romantic highlight is the scene in Marian's bedchamber, a Romeo-and-Juliet-like moment with Flynn climbing a vine to her balcony to woo his damsel in distress. The archery tournament sequence is a joy to behold--and de Havilland was never more beautifully photographed than in her reaction close-ups as she realizes the tournament is a trap.

Una O'Connor is a joy as her loyal servant and Alan Hale makes a wonderful Little John. In fact, all of the supporting roles are perfectly cast.

Rousing entertainment that has charmed the socks off everyone since its release in 1938 and outclasses the Kevin Costner version in every way possible. Long live the bandit of Sherwood Forest!!

And last but not least, Erich Wolfgang Korngold's classic score remains one of the finest film scores ever, sweeping, majestic and always complimenting the on-screen action and romance.

Fortunately, it all looks and sounds better than ever before in the restored Ultra-Resolution process Warners used on their 2 Disc DVD. It probably looks even more gorgeous than it did on its original release in 1938 when it opened at Radio City Music Hall to rave reviews.",1181260800,5,2155,5.160458452722063
784891,5,6304111258,"This is a perfect movie for a father to watch with his son. It is helpful in trying to explain what morality is to a child and why it is important to be honest. Errol Flynn is a great actor, but I particulary like the supporting actor Basil Rathbone of Sherlock Holmes fame. He plays an excellent villain as the sheriff of Nottinham and Claude Raines was superb as the false king. Olivia de Havilland was a superstar actress at the time this film was made as well. This is absolutely classic cinema. Highly recommended.",1180310400,,519,4.473684210526316

784893,5,6304111258,"If there was one film I'd bring to a desert island, this film is it. I first watched it when I was 16 years old, and I've been dying to see this film fully restored on DVD. I'm sorry, but the 2006 BBC TV Series cannot hold a candle to this film. There's no sense of irony or grittiness here. Just unalloyed, unabashed, enthusiastic fun. Younger modern audiences used to the postmodern cynicism of the BBC TV Series or the terrible Kevin Costner attempt might have difficulty with the tone. But once you can set aside your doubts, this film is an absolutely joy to watch from start to finish.

Errol Flynn is, for me, the ultimate Robin Hood. Regardless of how many actors have gone before or after him, he stands tall as the greatest actor to ever play this role. He's matched by Basil Rathbone as Guy of Gisbourne. Both play off each other extremely well. And Oliva DeHavilland is still the screen goddess that modern actresses can only aspire to be.

The script is just terrific. Unlike modern action films, the action pieces flow naturally from the plotline, rather than the other way around. And even by today's standards, the swordfights are absolutely jaw-dropping. No CGI. No wirework. And the archery in this film is just incredible.

No doubt about it. This film is a classic - it has stood the test of time, and will probably still be a much loved film 50 years from now. Every lover of great films should have this on his shelf.",1177286400,11,1439,4.505747126436781

The other part I found wonderful was the making of on the 2nd disk.  The various things included were just remarkable.  Who would have thought to spray paint the leaves?

The Adventures of Robin Hood is a beautifully filmed, well acted action adventure story that has delighted generations of people.  It is one of my all time favorite movies.  Errol Flynn has just the right touch of dedication and mischeviousness to make this a hoot.  Olivia DeHaviland never looked lovelier.  Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains play their roles to evil perfection.  Add to that a load of charater actors like Alan Hale, Eugene Pallete and Una O'Connor for a fine cast.

784980,5,6304111258,"This is one cracking good film, and a superb transfer to HD DVD. The picture quality of the Technicolor transfer is jaw dropping. But what makes this disc even more special are the amazing extras. The special features include two documentaries, short films and cartoons, a dozen trailers for Flynn films such as Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk, and a Warner Night at the Movies feature.

Leonard Maltin's Warner Night at the Movies 1938 is a real time capsule, which recreates a full evening's movie programme of the time. In includes a vintage newsreel, musical short with Freddie Rich and His Orchestra performing several big band numbers, Katnip College cartoon, and a trailer for Angels with Dirty Faces (for any James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart or Ann Sheridan fans).

The real gems are the two documentaries, around 1 hour each, both of which are worth the price of this disc alone...

'Welcome to Sherwood: The Story of The Adventures of Robin Hood'  presented by film historian Rudy Behlmer, Leonard Maltin and others  features extensive interviews and archival footage of the production, cast and crew.

'Glorious Technicolor' plots the development of the Technicolor film process from beginning to end. It not only provides a great insight to the science, but features clips of the production process for some of the all time great movies such as Gone With the Wind, Red Shoes, Wizard of Oz, etc. It also includes color screen tests for a who's who of Hollywood stars of the 1930's and 40's - Ingrid Bergman, Marlene Dietrich, Bette Davis, Betty Grable, Maureen O'Hara and more.

784983,5,6304111258,"The art of the swashbuckler is demanding and few make the grade to the very top, as does ""The Adventures of Robin Hood,"" starring Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHaviland with Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains as the chief villains. A gift I gave to a ten year old grand nephew, who loves it, it combines perfectly lively action, suspense, romance and humor in a beautifully evoked if hardly realistic medieval setting. Recent commendable effors at swashbuckling like ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" which relies too much on gimics and special effects, even if it has a light touch; and ""Master and Commander,"" which strives too much for realism and becomes too serious, I believe fall short. For pure swashbuckling, with this ""Robin Hood"" I'd include ""Gunga Din,"" with a stellar cast that includes Cary Grant, and ""The Sea Hawk,"" again with Flynn, at the very pinnacle. 1939's British ""Four Feathers"" comes close; the 2002 Heath Ledger version I find a disaster. Most of the rest in the swashbuckler stratosphere are also from Hollywood's golden years, 1935-41, although a few have appeared since, but these, such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" aim for historical drama and lack the light touch of a true swashbuckler.",1169251200,4,1199,4.970149253731344

He refined with charm and elegance plot and character with fluid camera movement and exquisite lightning, mixing action with peculiar sense of humor capturing with brilliant photography the natural look of Sherwood Forest, the cool tones of Nottingham Castle and the inn at Luton with its crackling fireplace...

The film had great marvelous scenes: When Robin decides to tackle with a staff Little John (Alan Hale); Robin's swordsplay with the gallant Friar Tuck (Eugene Palette); Robin and his Forest outlaws giving a warm welcome to Lady Marian and to the treasure's wagon lead by Sir Guy and the High Sheriff ; The Archery Tournament; Robin's Merry Men entering Nottingham Castle; and the magnificent final duel, with a masterful score, between Robin & Sir Guy...

Errol Flynn was the best swashbuckler of the sound era... He was ideally cast as the Saxon knight Sir Robin of Locksley who became a rebel outlaw robbing the rich to feed the poor... With his Merry Men he saved Saxon England against Norman ambitions... His most frequent enemies were the noisy High Sheriff of Nottingham (Melvin Cooper), the evil Bishop of Black Canon (Montagu Love), the eloquent chief conspirator Sir Guy of Gasbourne, and Prince John...

Flynn's splendid figure 'leaping, jumping, scaling and swinging' made him a great leader of men sheltering the old and the helpless... He was a romantic hero 'twinkling' with malice, gallantly courting the exquisite Olivia De Havilland...

Olivia De Havilland was a pretty and delicate woman in love with a brave and reckless outlaw...

Basil Rathbone, superb as the arrogant Sir Guy of Gisbourne, spreads terror by torturing, rivaling Robin for Lady Marian...

Claude Rains was the treacherous prince John who orders his Norman knights to oppress the helpless Saxons suffocating them with thefts, and burning their farms... He vows that Robin must be captured...

Winner of 3 Academy Awards (Art Direction, Original Score and Film Editing) ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" is a delighted tale of high adventure, a tale of action and colorful pageantry, a great film for all the family...",1166227200,4,2431,5.233933161953727

785074,5,6304111258,"The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) ""just works"" as a wonderful fantasy and Classical Hollywood cinema. And Warners certainly had the ""pick of the litter"" when it came to the cast: Errol Flynn [Australia], Basil Rathbone [South Africa], Claude Rains [England],Olivia de Havilland [born in Japan of English parents], Alan Hale, Eugene Pallette [United States]!It is an exuberant adventure about the second best known English name (after Willaim Shakespeare)and shows Errol Flynn in all his youth and promise. The Adventures of Robin Hood is one of the first ""feel good"" movies and your suspension of disbelief is rewarded with an joyous affirmation of life.  This restored print is a visual feast of techincolor and its ""too"" perfect contrast of colors in clothing and setting adds to the sense of a fantasy world. It is a black and white world of good and evil.

 We all know the story: Robin of Locksley is stripped of his Lands, Title and Liberty by the despotic usurper, Prince John: a Norman. In the act of restoring his name and property, Robin facilitates the return of rule of law to the Saxon people and restoration of the throne to Richard the Lionheart. And of course you can't have plausable ""goodies"" without plausable ""badies"".

Without Rathbone's portrayal of Sir Guy of Gisbourne as a capable, intelligent screen presence to make us believe he means what he says when he shouts, ""let me ram those words down his throat, your Highness!"" Robin Hood would have no worthwhile adversary. I mean just imagine Robin Hood having the climactic sword-fight the cowardly blustering Sheriff of Nottingham (Melville Cooper) ~ it would look like something out of ""The Court Jester"".
A serious sword fight between Danny Kaye and Basil Rathbone, as the equally villainous Sir Ravenhurst would have been nothing short of ridiculous.
Add the icy effete evil of Raines' Prince John to Gisbourne's menace and Flynn really has his work cut out for him!

Of course The Adventures of Robin Hood never lets the truth get in the way of a good story; the lively exchange between Robin and the incognito King Richard, in Sherwood Forest, could never have taken place; Richard spent almost no time in England and like earlier Plantagenet kings, could barely speak English.
But never mind all of that, this is a film is from the Classical Hollywood period, and with Michael Curtiz brought in to direct a film on the verge of disaster it became wonderful Saturday mattinee escapism to another heroic time and place.

The Adventures of Robin Hood is pure entertainment and the ""extras"" on the second disc in the set are further good reasons to get this Special Edition DVD. The doccos on Robin Hood through the Ages; Alan Hale was to play Litte John in three movies, Robin Hood (1922), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), Rogues of Sherwood Forest (1950). And the History of the Technicolor process, docco is well worth a look. Costume dramas were made for Technicolor, few movies have so many wardrobe changes for its characters; Maid Marian, Sir Guy of Gisbourne, Prince John had stunning  clothing changes in every scene.",1163980800,2,3109,4.91047619047619

The second disc contains a lot of information that the average person doesn't know. Such as James Cagney was origianlly picked to star as Robin Hood but had a fight with the bosses and walked off the lot.

There's also a short about one of the masters of the bow, Howard Hill. A couple Merrie Melodies cartoons starring Buggs and Daffy. And best of all, a behind the scenes look at the stars who made up the extraordinary cast.

785142,5,6304111258,"I have seen this film more often than any other single film in my life.  Is it the Absolute Best Film Of All Time?  Probably not, yet this is one of the best pure Hero Films that ever graced the screen.  Errol Flynn simply is Robin Hood (in this very clean-cut vision); Olivia deHaviland, who I crushed on terribly as a young lad, is the perfect Maid Marion; Rathbone & Raines are perfect smooth villains, at times even admirable, yet ultimately dispicible.  Yes, it is a very much Good Guys Versus Bad Guys And The Bad Guys Are Bound To Lose in its formula, but that is what we want in a film like this -- absolutes, with snappy action, clever dialogue, some good fencing scenes, bright colours, and a wonderful Happy Ending.

Most of the extras for this two disc set are also quite wonderful -- the cartoons that play off the movie, the sea voyage, the archery short, etc.  The one place I can fault the collection is the Night At The Movies segment.  Why?  Because it is a combination of incomplete and atypical.  Instead of getting a full newsreel, as would have been both appropriate and easy to obtain, we are given a couple of quick spots of questionable nature -- a full newreel, warts and all, would have served better as a documentary of the true period of the film.  The music short is fine enough, both mildly comic and toe-tapping.  The cartoon segment, however, is amazingly atypical for the era.  Come on!  This is Warner Brothers!  We have other types of cartoons that would have been more ""mainstream"" for the period (both musically and in general tone) that would have been much more appropriate for such a film.  Why do we get this song-toon?  Becuase the tune is more ""accessible"" to the modern ear?  That will be a passing phase.  Give us what the purports to be -- a real glimpse of the films own time!

Still, let me say that this minor shortcoming in no way affects the overall quality of the product.  The colours of the film are clear and bright, the soundtrack bell-like, and you will love the package.  Huzzah!",1155168000,2,2038,4.483695652173913

Filmed in Color, ""Robin Hood"" like ""Gone With The Wind"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", and ""Citizen Kane"", are among the very first truly great modern films. Released in 1938, this was high adventure, and yet was much more than a costume piece with swashbuckling Robin Hood fighting evil, and finding romance. Basically, Robin Hood, a saxon nobleman, lays it all on the line for doing the right thing. To this end, everything about the film, depicts doing the right thing for the right reasons, and in style. What movie theme could possibly beat that!

ROBIN HOOD IS ALL ABOUT DANGER - FUN & ROMANCE: Robin Hood played by Errol Flynn appears to be a brash rabble-rouser. A rude outlaw without constructive purpose or common decency. In short, lacking any admirable traits beyond his fearless, cocky, boorishness that Maid Marian [Olivia de Havilland] could ever appreciate. Well, that is if such things could be seen as admirable traits.

Needless to say, Robin Hood wins Maid Marion's heart, and deservedly so, as she comes to know him by his deeds. To this end, the film shows - rather than tells, and in ways that further the plot while maintaining the action, and pace of the film, just like fine literature.

ROBIN HOOD FIGHTS WORTHY ADVERSARIES AS AN UNDERDOG FOR NOBLE CAUSES!

Like all great adventures, ""The adventures of Robin Hood"", have great personalities playing the roles of heros, side-kicks, but most of all -- VILLIANS! Basil Rathbone, as Sir Guy of Gisbourne, is an able adversary for Robin Hood in all things, and covets the affection of Maid Marion, which Sir Guy's obvious evilness will prevent him from ever attaining.

The Good King Richard the Lion-Hearted has as his sly nemesis, his own brother, the shrewd and treacherous Prince John. For John, it is England itself, and its plunder that he covets. His brother, the King, is simply in the way, and Richard's absence has made this prospect for John, appear possible. With the ransoming of Richard by Leopold of Austria, the time for the coup was now!

To this evil end, the two chief villains have henchmen, and sidekicks, the principal being, The Sheriff of Nottingham, played for excellent comic relief by Melville Cooper.

THE GOOD GUYS ARE THE MERRY-MEN & THE BAD GUYS ARE REAL ""SOUR-PUSSES""!

Of course, Robin Hood has his merry men. Each of the main three is introduced via a little vignette which illustrates their mettle.

First - Herbert Mundin, as Much-the-Miller's-son, is the first of Robin's merry men to join up, as he is protected from a death sentence imposed on him by Sir Guy, for poaching, by Robin's physically heroic intervention.

Second - Alan Hale as Little John, literally runs into Robin when crossing a river on a log. The two do a nice job of joisting, kendo syle, over the river, until Robin falls in after he is bettered. Naturally, the character of Robin is illustrated by his jovial good-sporting nature as he declares, ""I like a man who can better me""! Enter, Little John.

Third - Eugene Pallette as Friar Tuck. An even more comical confrontation introduces this distinctively stout and coarse voiced character to Robin, and us. Again, Robin ends up in the water, and again, he makes a friend.

The meetings of Robin with his principal merry-men is from folklore, and well illustrates the basic goodness of Robin, and the company he keeps. This basic ""merryness"" is the determining difference between the good-guys and the bad-guys. In this film, the good are merry and bad are real sourpusses!

CLOSING THOUGHTS: ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" is a timeless, classic adventure epic whose production values, and attention to detail place it in very select company among the best films of any century. However, of more relevance is The Adventure of Robin Hood's pure and enduring, entertainment value which rivals any film ever made. Is there a better reason to see a film?",1142121600,5,5747,4.924843423799582

785193,5,6304111258,"This is one of the best Robin Hood movies ever done.  The swordfighting is realistic and there is lots of action, some romance, and a little bit of comedy.  I have been shooting a recurve bow for 15 years and fencing for 10 years, so I feel safe saying that the action scenes are true swordfighting tactics, not some rehearsed sword banging to dazzle the audience.  The DVD also has a couple of Disney cartoons and a documentary trip that Errol Flynn made with his father.  There is also a small film done by the Master Archer ""Errol's double"" that shows some incredible shots with a bow arrow.

  I highly recommend this movie.  Unfortunately they don't make ""future"" classics like this nowdays.",1141776000,2,696,4.647540983606557

Olivia deHaviland has never looked lovelier nor more desirable. Flynn, is at his best, Basil Rathbone is Robin's perfect nemesis, Claude Rains brings such light hearted meanness to Prince John and the lesser characters are all top drawer.

My wife and I had to watch several other Technicolor costume epics to realize how very good this film is.

The added features are fun and informative, from the pieces on Howard Hill, the great archer who made the shots in the film, to the story of the Technicolor process, to the behind-the-scenes footage. The whole package is a treasure and a worthy addition to any DVD collection.",1140739200,2,859,4.86986301369863

The probably overworked phrase definitely applies here; THEY DON'T MAKE 'EM LIKE THIS ANYMORE.",1140739200,,414,5.044117647058823
785199,5,6304111258,"I purchased this one from Amazon on its release and this review is long over due. Warner Home Video have really done themselves proud with this superb presentation. In fact, it most likely looks better now than on its original release in 1938; that's the year of my birth. I remember seeing it in my local cinema, in England, when it was doing the rounds on its second release in the late 1940's, it enthralled me then and still does so now, even after numerous viewings.

This film has all the ingredients necessary for a smash hit, (or block buster, in modern terms) which are: the actors with the necessary charm and charisma for the leads (Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Claud Rains, Basil Rathbone, Eugene Pallete, Alan Hale, Patric Knowles, Ian Hunter and Montague Love), the necessary character actors for support and comedy (Herbert Mundin, Una O'Conner and Melville Cooper), direction ( William Keighley and Michael Curtez), music score (Erich Wolfgang Korngold), and superb editing of the finished product. That it was a 'smash hit' is undisputed, whether it is, or was, the best version of ""Robin Hood"" is a matter of opinion. For me, personally, it is unsurpassed and it is most unlikely (but not impossible considering today's technology)to be surpassed in this age in which we live.

Errol Flynn was at his 'dashing' best; athletic, witty and charming. Fast moving but literate, he played no better role, in no better movie at any time during his career; a much better actor than he was ever given credit for. What better villain could the studio produce than Basil Rathbone? As for some comic relief; who could better Herbert Mundin (very popular in the 1930's, see ""Mutany On the Bounty"", ""David Copperfield"" and many others) as ""Much the Miller's son"" with Una O'Connor as his love interest; and Melville Cooper as a bumbling Sheriff of Nottingham? Legend says that the Sheriff was really a most evil and vile person but here the producers decided to make him more of a figure of fun.

This two disc presentation has loads of bonus features, all of which have been given a great deal of thought and are subsequentely well worth viewing. Disc 1 The movie, a feature length commentary by Film Historian Rudy Behlmer, a music only Audio Track, Leonard Maltin hosts Warner Night at the Movies 1938 with 1)Trailer for Angels with Dirty Faces - 2) Newsreel - 3)Musical Short with Freddie Rich and His Orchestra and 4) Merrie Melodies Cartoon Katnip Kollege; and finally twelve Trailers all Errol Flynn movies including the 1938 and 1942 releases of the Adventures of Robin Hood. Disc 2 has a host of interesting shorts including sequences not used in the film, an Annual Year End Blooper Reel. Robin Hood through the Ages with a look at other film adaptations; a look at some rare Home Movie shots taken by Basil Rathbone on location or on the studio backlot; cartoons Bugs Bunny in ""Rabbit Hood"" and Daffy Duck in ""Robin Hood Daffy""; other shorts are Calalcade of Archery; The Cruise of the Zaca; Splitting the Arrow containing extra info on the making of the movie; the Robin Hood Radio Show from May 11, 1938 an audio broadcast; a Korngold piano session and finally Angelia Lansbury narrates a short on the evolution of the Vivid Film Making Process of Which The Adventures of Robin Hood is a Shimmering Example. The contents of the discs are as stated on the inside cover of the box set; a superb presentation in its self.

The production values in the main movie were, and still are, there for all to see; the brilliant three colour early Technicolor, the superb music score which audibly grabs and excites the viewer into believing (at least for a time) what they are seeing, the excellent sets of medieval England and the superb editing of the finished product which brings it all together. This one was, still is and will continue to be great entertainment with lots of fun for young and old alike. 5 Stars - a pity I can't give it 10!

Incidentally, the DVDs are region encoded 1,2,3,4, and 5. Can be viewed anywhere in the world; as are the other Warner box set Errol Flynn The Signature Collection, also highly recommended. I must get around to doing a review on this one too!",1140652800,2,4201,4.7257844474761255
785200,5,6304111258,"Has there been a more dashing swashbuckler than Errol Flynn in the late 1930's? As this 1938 classic attests, Robin Hood is the role he was born to play. Wearing his green tights, speaking medieval dialogue, and brandishing a sword with equal aplomb, Flynn is at his charismatic peak in one of the liveliest adventures filmed during Hollywood's golden era. Hands down, this is the most definitive version of the legend of Sir Robin of Locksley, and much of the credit needs to go to veteran director Michael Curtiz and his predecessor, William Keighley.

In successive turns (due to an astute studio decision), Curtiz and Keighley bring the fanciful tale to vibrant life with breathless pacing, elaborate sets and costumes, memorable dueling sequences and a clever script written by Norman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller. For all these virtues, the most lasting impression one has in watching the film now is the amazingly rich Technicolor courtesy of the sharp cinematography by Tony Gaudio and Sol Polito, and from my perspective, even more hue-saturated than the camerawork in the following year's ""Gone With the Wind"". The colors pop vividly, especially in the ornate costumes designed by Milo Anderson and sometimes a bit too excessively as in the Hawaiian Punch color of the wine pouring out of the damaged barrels.

Set in 12th century England (though filmed outside Chico, California), the story focuses on Robin's outlaw attempts to thwart the usurper Prince John's dastardly plan to take over the throne from his absent brother, Richard the Lionhearted. Loyal to the true king, Robin collects every Saxon peasant he can find to create a resistance movement, and with his band of merry men, he must face not only John but his crafty henchman, Sir Guy of Gisbourne. As if this wouldn't keep him busy enough, Robin falls for Maid Marian, a Norman royal ward who is at first resistant but quickly succumbs to his charms and courage. This is not the type of movie where you think too deeply about character motivations or the veracity of plot developments because this is escapist fare of the highest order.

Casting is perfect even beyond Flynn. The 21-year old Olivia de Havilland is spirited and luminous as Marian shimmering in period costume and looking most breathtaking sans headdress in a diaphanous gown as Robin bounds up to her balcony. Basil Rathbone brings roguish swagger to villainous Sir Guy, and he and Flynn amaze in their climactic sword fight when they move fluidly offscreen and are replaced briefly by their dueling shadows cast on a huge stone pillar. In a severe pageboy wig that must have been the envy of Joan Crawford, Claude Rains plays a rueful Prince John with a mocking malevolence that marks his best performances, ""Casablanca"" and ""Notorious"" included. Others fare equally well, including Alan Hale Sr. (his look-alike son was the Skipper on ""Gilligan's Island"") as a rascally Little John, gravelly-voiced Eugene Pallette as a portly Friar Tuck, Patric Knowles as an erudite Will Scarlet, Herbert Mundin as comical Much-the-Miller's-Son and Una O'Connor as Marian's multi-married lady-in-waiting Bess. Erich Wolfgang Korngold wrote the heroic music score with fervor. This is superb entertainment.

The two-disc DVD set is chockfull of extras, in particular, two hour-long documentaries. One is an informative making-of 2003 feature, ""Welcome to Sherwood Forest: The Story of the Adventures of Robin Hood"", and the other is the even more interesting ""Glorious Technicolor"" which explains the color filmmaking process, ideal given that the film represents one of the best uses of the process. Also entertaining is film historian Rudy Behlmer's enthusiastic audio commentary and a Leonard Maltin-hosted replication of what the 1938 movie-going experience was like, including a trailer for ""Angels with Dirty Faces"", a newsreel, a musical short and a cartoon. There are two more Robin Hood-inspired cartoons, ancient outtakes and bloopers and trailers for 12 of Flynn's films. This is one of the more impressive DVD packages on the market.",1140307200,,4076,5.161875945537065
785201,5,6304111258,"It's so wonderful that ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" with Errol Flynn was given such great dvd treatment.  The copy is excellent. Very clear and bright picture, like seeing the film for the first time.  Plus this two-disc set has plenty of extra features, interviews and documentaries. This is a must have for classic movie fans and Errol Flynn fans alike.  It's a beautiful film , full of adventure  and romance.  Errol Flynn is the definitive Robin Hood, he looks like the real one from the books and acts the part to supreme excellence.  I think Olivia D'Havilland is also the perfect Maid Marian, beautiful, wise, and also kind of shy and fragile as well.

All the supporting cast is excellent as well, Alan Hale and the rest play their roles to perfection and are great as Robin Hood's devoted Merry Men. Basil Rathbone plays Sir Guy to perfection he's really believable as the villen and Claude Rains I think does and equally wonderful job as Prince John.  A really evil but likeable villen.

It has excellent acting , tons of adventure, and great sword fighting and archery scenes.  For new viewers of this film , the color will really impress them, with the lovely forest scenes and beautiful costuming. The archery contest alone is colorful and really impressive.

This film is definitly first rate and watching it each time is just as exciting as the first.  It's always very interesting and action packed.  I also would like to point out besides the action and adventure the romance between Robin and Marian is very nice too and their are some beautiful  and touching scenes between them.  As in all their films Miss D'Havilland and Errol Flynn really make a believable couple and lovely couple who look very much in love.

(This review is for the special edition of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" released in 2003.)

This movie attempts to blend the various ancient legends of Robin Hood into a story.  It definitely succeeds magnificently in doing this!

Adventure, romance, and spectacle are most apparent in this definitive version of the legend of Robin Hood (Errol Flynn).  Never before has good triumphed over evil with such spectacular color and flamboyance.

This movie begins with the printed word serving to orientate the viewer:

""In the year of Our Lord 1191 when [King] Richard, the Lion-Heart [Ian Hunter], set forth to drive the infidels from the Holy Land, he gave the Regency of his Kingdom to his trusted friend, Longchamps, instead of to his treacherous brother, Prince John [Claude Rains].

Bitterly resentful, John hoped for some disaster to befall Richard so that he, with the help of the Norman barons, might seize the throne for himself.  And then on a luckless day for the Saxons [it is announced that King Richard has been captured in his Holy Land battles].

The great cold hall of Nottingham Castle, the stronghold of [the evil] Sir Guy of Gisbourne [Basil Rathbone, perhaps best known for playing `Sherlock Holmes'], knew an unaccustomed warmth this night, for Prince John and his friends [which includes the High Sheriff of Nottingham, played with comic brilliance by Melville Cooper] were met to celebrate a promising future.""

However, Prince John underestimated the loyalty to King Richard of the Saxon Sir Robin of Locksley (Robin Hood) and his Merry Men.  Robin's main Merry Men included Will Scarlett (Pat Knowles), Much the miller's son (Herbert Mundin), the very tall Little John (Alan Hale, who played the part three times; his son was the skipper on ""Gilligan's Island""), and Friar Tuck (Eugene Pallette).  Robin later gets the help of Maid Marian (Olivia de Havilland), the royal ward of King Richard.

The movie ends with a climactic sword duel between Robin Hood and Sir Guy.  You can't miss this!

All actors do extraordinary jobs in their roles.  And then there's Errol Flynn as Robin Hood.  He displays an irresistible charisma that shines through on screen and as well, imparts an athletic grace essential to this role.  (Do you know anyone else that can do this in leotards and a silly bonnet?)

The Academy Award-winning background music for this movie is superb.  It adds to each scene.

I also have this movie on videotape with all its distracting artifacts and dull colors.  The DVD, however, is perfect.  All artifacts have been removed.  All colors are lush.  The spoken word and music are crystal clear.

Finally, the DVD includes fifteen extras, all of which I found interesting.  My favorite extras include:

(1) ""Welcome to Sherwood: The Story of the Adventures of Robin Hood.""  This 2003 documentary explains everything about this classic movie including how it was made, the people involved both behind and in front of the camera, and the evolution of the Robin Hood legend.
(2) Commentary by a film historian.  This historian does pretty much the same things as in #(1) above.  However, this commentary has the actual movie playing in the background as the historian is talking.
(3) Music-only audio track showcasing the movie's marvelous musical score.
(4) ""Robin Hood through the Ages.""  A look at Robin Hood's earlier screen adaptations.
(5) ""Classic Cartoons.""  Here you get to see Bugs Bunny in ""Rabbit Hood"" and Daffy Duck in ""Robin Hood Daffy.""

In conclusion, this is a classic movie that has been restored on DVD.  Never has Sherwood Forest looked so good!!!

785353,5,6304111258,"1938's The Adventures of Robin Hood is one of the greatest adventure movies ever made. Everything works, first rate acting, great writing, excellent action, and just a whole bunch of fun. Errol Flynn shines in his best movie, he was born to play Robin Hood and no actor (I'm talking to you Kevin Costner) as even come close to his Robin Hood. Olivia de Havilland is also excellent as Robin's love intrest Maid Marion, her chemistry with Flynn is unmatched. Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone both shine as the power hungry Prince John and the cold heart Guy of Gisborne. Also worth mentioning is some great work from a lot of the great character actors of the 1930's people like Alan Hale and Melville Cooper and Eugene Pallette. It's a great movie with some very memorable scenes (Flynn walking into the Castle with a deer slung over his back is classic).

Now for the DVD

The print is excellent, the picture is clear and clean and the colors all vibrant.

It's also jampacked with special features most notably a long and in-depth documentary on the making of the film that goes into every area of the production. Another nice feature is called ""Warner Night at the Movies"" this feature allows you to watch a cartoon, an old trailer, and new update (1938 news of course) this simulates the feel of watching the movie in an old theater back in the 1930's. It also has commentary by a film historian that you can play throughout the entire movie.

There is another documentary on so-called Glorious Technicolor and there is also some thing called Robin Hood Through the Ages that is mostly footage from the old silent Douglas Faribanks Robin Hood.

Also it has two short films one shot and narrated by Errol Flynn about a scientific expedition on his personal yacht, the other is an Archery showcase by Howard Hill (widely regarded as the best archer in the world at that time, he shot the arrows during the archery tournemant sequence and other sequences in the Adventures of Robin Hood.) Wait, there's more!? There are galleries in which you can view concept art, and posters and other kinds art from the Adventures of Robin Hood. There are even two Robin Hood based old cartoons one with Bugs Bunny and one with Daffy Duck.

All in all this one of the best DVD's I have ever bought definatly worth the low price. Great movie, great DVD, highly recommended",1111622400,7,2356,4.6514423076923075
785354,5,6304111258,"Errol Flynn is a erotic AND boyish challenge as Robin Hood - no wonder Lady Marian and his men are following him. Errol is magnetic and has a charm that has not dated a bit. Nor has  Olivia deHavilland, Basil Rathbone, Claude Rains and Eugene Pallette - all at the best of their powers.

The production is of such standard that a remake or further films are of no use.",1110067200,3,368,4.242857142857143
785355,3,6304111258,"Errol Flynn's ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" was the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" of its day, a roller coaster ride, a thrill a minute, etc.  Of course, ""Raiders"" took its inspiration from films like this and from the serial thrillers of the '30s, so that's no surprise.  Today our cultural remembrances of Robin Hood spring from this film, so great is its fame and so deep is our love as a society for the character who reputedly defended the defenseless against heartless oppressors.

And one cannot fault many of the performances in this relic, my personal favorite being Claude Rains as the amoral Prince John; not a bit of overdone melodrama on his part, in spite of his opportunities to chew the scenery.  Rains plays the character as smoothly as anyone could wish.  The cinematography is beautiful and often the shots are inventive, including the famous shadowed climactic swordfight between Robin and Sir Guy.  The story is generally well written and the pace is just right.

It's easy to see why this is such a long-time favorite.  But as a first-time viewer to this film I'm not overwhelmed.  Another reviewer on this page gushes, ""If this movie is not a five star film, then none are.""  So, I suppose none are, though I could name about 100 better movies (Lawrence of Arabia, Local Hero, The Philadelphia Story, The Lady Eve, Treasure Of the Sierra Madre, The Matrix, Streetcar Named Desire, Casablanca, Double Indemnity, the aforementioned Raiders...OK OK, I'll stop there, but that list took only about 30 seconds to come up with).

The flaws in this film almost outweigh its positives.  Consider the too-convenient story logic that says, first:  ""How do we get the word to Robin and his men?  Don't worry, he has ears in every bush, he'll find out.""  But later Maid Marian has to sneak out of the castle to get word to his men that he's been arrested and will be hanged.  What happened to ears in every bush?

Consider the early scene with Robin in Sir Guy's castle as Prince John's ""guest.""  He has to shoot his way out, and while his quiver initially carried about four or five arrows he manages to get off seven or eight shots.....and still leaves the castle with at least three arrows in that magical quiver.

Consider also the poor editing when Robin ""welcomes"" Sir Guy to Sherwood Forest:  Flynn turns to his left as if about to leap out of the tree, which he does in the next shot, but the closeup goes on too long and we see Flynn stop in midstep awaiting the director to cry ""Cut!""

Consider also the lame mockery of swordfighting that often goes on behind the main characters in the climactic battle between the men of Richard and John:  Extras clearly just trying not to hurt themselves or each other.

Consider again the fight between Robin and Sir Guy:  On the stairs the bad guy's sword is right in Robin's gut for a full beat before he's pushed over the stairs, whereas a moment like that in reality would have meant immediate death for our hero, ah, but this is Hollywood.

Consider, finally, the scene where Robin and Marian declare their love:  Their noses an inch apart, the director chooses to insert closeups, each of Flynn and de Havilland, that feature several inches of blank air in front of each nose.  She also tilts her head in a different direction in each shot.  Laughable.

Silly, absolutely silly errors of continuity, staging, writing, and editing that unnecessarily mar some really brilliant moments of early cinema.  I'm sure there are more charitable souls than mine who are willing to overlook such sloppy work, or at least to simply overlook it as the residue of the early years when Hollywood was still perfecting the craft, but I can think of earlier films that were more perfectly made (Modern Times, Svengali, The Kid, Camille, Les Miserables...oh, I do go on).",1109894400,6,3809,4.692771084337349
785356,5,6304111258,"Warner has leaped into major Criterion Collection territory with this release, an exhaustive package with literally DAYS worth of supplementary viewing.  The Technicolor documentary is a sharp and intelligent work, full of luscious examples of 3-strip color (and a noteworthy discussion of the color scheme in ""Gone With The Wind,"" and why it looks nothing like other Technicolor films).  Trailers, cartoons, short subjects, still galleries, commentary...what a labor of love.

The image quality of the film itself may represent the closest thing to a true 35mm Technicolor screening that we have ever had on video.  It is positively three-dimensional.  (Should Fox EVER get around to releasing ""The Gang's All Here"" on DVD, it will probably look even better than this).

A friend, viewing this for the first time, noted that it is nothing like a 30s movie.  It's true, almost nothing has dated (for comparison, look at another costume pic of that year--""Marie Antoinette,"" which has dated badly). I would say only the score and, as mentioned in the documentary, deHavilland's eyebrows, are the giveaways to when the movie was made.

A major film in every way.  With a presentation to match.",1105660800,4,1191,5.161458333333333

But this...oh I envy you if you have not seen this yet. I most certainly envy your upcoming joyous movie-going moment of discovery.

If this movie is not a five star film, then none are.

There are so many perfect things about ""The Adventures of Robin Hood""...so many things the filmmakers got absolutely right...that not only is it the best cinematic telling of the Robin Hood legend, it's one of the best cinematic tellings of anything.

Errol Flynn inhabits this role such that you're sure this is what Robin Hood must have really been like...you don't even bother with the question of whether or not he really did exist. Of course he did, and he looked and spoke and fought just like Errol Flynn.

Claude Rains, as the oily Prince John and Basil Rathbone, as the principal nemesis Guy of Gisbourne, are sheer perfection as well. Every line delivery, arched eyebrow...they have the parts nailed.

The Band of Merry Men are terrific as well. You will instantly become fond of Much, Little John, Friar Tuck...only Will Scarlett seems to be an add-on.

Olivia deHavilland is something to behold as Maid Marian. She's initially repulsed by Robin, yet as we all know will fall in love with him by the end. Just using her eyes, she tells her side of the story...she doesn't even need to read her lines.

The direction is brisk, the screenplay literate, the banter witty and the plot has nice surprises sprinkled throughout. Two things stand out above all.
One: The lush cinematography to this day is an example of how colorful film can be.
To this day. It was made in 1938, but it looks gorgeous.
Two: Korngold's justly lauded score. It's the model for pretty much every epic action adventure filmed since. It's never intrusive, but from beginning to end it feels as if it's of a piece....a whole...it's not ""just"" a soundtrack.

Now let's get to the DVD. Again, it's perfect. The transfer sparkles.
The extras are almost overwhelming, and to be honest, I haven't made it through them all yet. There are great documentaries on the film, on Technicolor itself...home movies, Korngold's score on an isolated track, a nice commentary bu Rudy Behlmer (who hosts most of the extras) and that neat ""night at the movies"" feature where you can recreate the moviegoing experience of 1938 by watching a trailer, a newsreel, a a short and a cartoon all before the main feature.

Have seen it many times since then, of course, and now I've got this terrific dvd I'll see it many times in the future.  It is possible to criticise this film, but any fault-finding would be completely pointless. Forget it, this is the best there is or ever will be. Gee, I wish I could be Errol Flynn.

The movie itself is peerless.  Errol Flynn as Robin, the beautiful Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian, Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains as the bad guys, and Hollywood's top tier of British-born character actors fill out the saga.

That's all well and good, but the DVD is where Warners has really excelled.  For a movie that's over 65 years old, the picture is practically pristine, and while the soundtrack is little more than glorified mono, there are no hisses or pops that I could detect.  And the extras ...

On disc one we have a commentary by Rudy Behlmer, whose tracks are almost always guaranteed to be as entertaining as they are informative (see his chats for Casablanca or Yankee Doodle Dandy for more great yakkers).  He relays studio trivia, production notes, gossip from the era -- anything and everything.  That's not all, though; there's an isolated music track featuring the score of Erich Wolfgang Korngold, a rousing work that has been unfairly dismissed as being simplistic and overbearing.  Warners also attempts to give us a peek at what it would be like to attend a movie in 1938, with a theatrical trailer, a newsreel, a cartoon and a short subject.  It's a wonderful idea that should be repeated more often on classic DVDs.  Rounding out disc one is an Errol Flynn trailer gallery, with previews for 12 of his movies (actually 11, as Robin Hood has two separate trailers.

It doesn't stop there.  Disc two has two documentaries, one on the history of Technicolor (most informative) and one on the movie itself (pretty good, but a bit repetitive from the commentary).  There are a couple of deleted scenes (without sound), and a blooper reel from various Warner movies of 1938.  We get a couple of short featurettes: a retrospective one on the history of the Robin Hood legend in film, a contemporary one about archery, a travelogue Errol Flynn made a few years before he died, and Basil Rathbone's home movies from the set!  We also get a couple of Looney Tunes cartoons slightly related to the movie, a huge still and publicity material gallery, and, finally, a couple of audio supplements: a radio show promoting the movie and some piano tracks with Korngold himself playing music from his different films.

Whew!  Suffice it to say, this is definitely up there among my top five DVDs ever.  Not to be missed.

The epic swashbuckling adventure of one of history's greatest heroes.the dashing Errol Flynn as Robin Hood or as they also call him ""Sir Robin of Locksley"" was perfect. He was what a swashbuckler should be and probably the greatest of all swashbucklers. Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains were brilliant as Robin's foes, Sir Guy and Prince John. Oliva DeHavilland was glamorous as the love of Robin Hood, Maid Marian. My Favorite scene was Robin and Sir Guy's sword fight during King Richard's return. Flynn and Rathbone two of cinema's sword fighting experts. I love the sound of sword clangling. If your looking for a classic film or a swashbuckler film, this is a great one.

I owned an edition with many of these extras in the laserdisc format, and it's terrific that it's now been released on DVD with even more fun goodies...although it could be simply the film itself, nothing else on this DVD-and believe me, you'd be more than satisfied.
This is one of those ""classic"" films that are so famous you might feel you know it already-even if you haven't seen it.  And, you may dismiss it out of hand if you HAVEN'T seen it as ""corny"" or kitchy-DON'T!
I've been lucky enough to see this in a theatre recently with an audience which included lots of pretty jaded kids-exactly the demographic you'd expect to be embarrassed at the thought of sitting through an ""old"" movie like this...and they cheered along with the diehard film buffs and old-timers.  In fact, I defy anyone to dislike this film...it's just got everything, as has been pointed out elsewhere here:  a terrific script, brilliant Technicolor(literally eye-popping!), beautiful scenery and costumes, one of the very greatest of film scores by an acknowledged master-and especially, crucially, the cast:  Errol Flynn is funny, athletic, gorgeous, and witty in a role that-well, how can it have been easy to attempt playing?  Even in 1937 ""Robin Hood"" was a fairy tale of a story...but Flynn pulls it off brilliantly.  Every single actor in the cast, in fact, is spot-on perfect casting.  And it mightn't have been that way:  listen to Rudy Behlmer's peerless commentary(the standard to which all other golden age commentaries should be held)and discover a primer in filmmaking, studio politics, the history of the legend of Robin Hood, and more...amazing!

785419,5,6304111258,"The Adventures of Robin Hood...this is, in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.  This Academy Award winning film flawlessly tells a story based on English legend, about Robin of Locksley (Errol Flynn), a noble Saxon forced to take up arms against the Normans as the Prince John, the king's brother, tries to take the throne in his King Richard's absence.
In turning outlaw, Robin's following grows, as the Normans levy harsh taxes and exact brutal retribution against the Saxon population if they are unable to sate the greedy and uncaring reign of Prince John, played by Claude Rains.  Basil Rathebone plays Sir Guy of Gisbourne, a Norman noble supporting Prince John's absconding of the throne and vying for the hand in marriage of Maid Marion, a charge in the King's care, who falls in love with Robin once she sees that he is no mere thief, but a protector and provider of the people being oppressed by her Norman countrymen.
This film is a perfect example of every element of a movie coming together.  The immaculate direction, perfect casting, exquisite music score, sharp and witty dialogue, beautifully expansive sets and scenery and highly detailed, colorful  costumes...you are literally transported back to the 12th century as the movie draws you in and keeps your attention throughout.  Errol Flynn becomes Robin, with his sly smile and cheerfully upbeat nature, even in the face of such adversity.  The lovely Olivia deHavilland is Maid Marian, with her expressive eyes and loving nature.  Claude Rains brings to life the character of Prince Richard perfectly, as the back stabbing opportunist trying to steal the throne.  My favorite though has to be Basil Rathebone as Sir Guy of Gisbourne.  He really creates a character the viewer loves to hate.
Given this was a 65th anniversary release of the movie from Warner Brothers, I was very pleased to see that they did right by the film.  Not known for their including special features, Warner Brothers provides so many wonderful bits including making of features, outtakes, a look at other screen adaptations of the Robin Hood story, classic cartoons, historical materials, photo galleries, and so much more.  I have only touched the tip of the iceberg, so to speak, so view the product page to see a complete listing.  One thing I found exceptionally interesting was the recreation of a night at the movies, basically allowing us to see what it was like to go to the movies back in the late 30's, presenting newsreels, a cartoon, and other goodies prior to showing the feature.  Quite an interesting experience to see how the movies were actually a full night of entertainment for people back in the day.
If you like spectacular epics with thrilling action and adventure, with a dash of comedic element, then this movie is for you.  Heck, if you like movies in general, then treat yourself and your family, as they just don't get any better than this.

If this isn't the definitive presentation of this film, then I cannot imagine what will be.
Maybe the true test of a great film, or a great legend, is whether or not it means as much to you as an adult as it did as a kid. Would you go out of your way to introduce your children to it? As the credits say, this is based upon the ancient Robin Hood legends. That is why it holds up. Robin is the champion of the people. He holds England for it's true King in the face of murderous, thieving usurpers. I still get a chill when he tells his men to scour the country and bring King Richard back safe to Sherwood.

Sir Robin of Locksley: I'm only just beginning. From this night forward I'll use every means in my power to fight you!
Lady Marian Fitzswalter: Why, you speak treason!
Sir Robin of Locksley: Fluently.

785496,5,6304111258,"Warner's dvd release of one of the best adventure films ever made is one of the best dvds availble.
65 years old, the picture hasn't dated the way most films have. An extraordinary success of all front the picture is as fun and entertaining as it was 65 years ago. Adventures of robin hood is the first great color film. Few films have made such a glorious use of techicolor. Stunning visuals are created with excellent sets, costumes, locations, and photography. The script is smart and funny with dialogue that holds up well. The production assembled one of the greatest ensembles of supporting players that breathed life into colorfully scripted supporting roles. ""Adventures"" is one of the best Hollywood films ever made and arguebly the benchmark for all adventure films.
Picture quality on the dvd is a knockout. Having seen the film on scratchy vhs, i was blown away by the dvd print. Sharpness and oh the glorious color is brilliant. Obiviously its not perfect there is some tough grain on some scenes and sometimes the focus is soft, but for a film 65 years old to look this good is a miracle. Watching the dvd for the first time i saw so many things that were rendered invisible in the blur and bleed of vhs. Never did the dvd's color bleed, and rarely have i seen such a marvelous example of color on the dvd. The film is in pre widescreen full frame that perserves the aspect ratio, although many tvs still tend to cut off a bit. In my case one title card had the last letters cut in half.
Sound is a little less sucessful, but still clear and clean. The mix is recorded low so you have to crank it up. I thought the voices were a little hard to hear over the score in the opening scenes, but the problem was not noticable later.
The extra package is one of the best i've ever seen. First you get a wonderful slipcover of the movie poster.
Disc 1 has among other things a brilliant commentary by historian Rudy Behlmer. The man is a genius, his talk is one of the most comprehensive commentaries i've heard. He covers the history of the robin hood legend and english history, incredibly detailed info about where, when and who shot every scene, and indepth background on the production. He talks from his book, but his manner of speaking is far from reading, but very conversational even if the comments are academic. Also on the first disc is an awesome collection of movie trailers from flynn's career. Obviously not every movie is there, but there are over ten and are a fun watch to see how they hyped films back in the day.
Disc 2 starts with an extremely informative documentary on technicolor hosted by angela lansbury that is a must watch for anyone interested in film history. The history of color cinema is a subject rarely discussed in detail unlike the history of sound, so i found the doc very insightful. The great rudy behlmer leads the ""welcome"" documentary and gives a great look at the production. Those not wanting to sit through the audio commentary should definately watch this because it provides the entire backstory in an engaging format with photos and interviews. Behlmer hosts an outtake reel ""cutting room"" with extremely rare footaging including a blooper of a crew guy popping up in the castle when robin swings up the rope. ""Through the ages"" is a fabulous behlmer presentation that shows much of the fairbanks silent robin hood and comparisons are made. It is surprising to find that many scenes were copied for ""adventures"". ""Journey"" is a less interesting set of home video footage of the production with behlmer talking, his knowledge is stunning because he indentifies most of the crew members. Strangley, head director curtiz only appears very briefly. Other cool extras include vintage shorts on the archer howard hill and a flynn boating trip. Hill's archery tricks are fun and the presentation is funny due to corny narration. A huge photo gallery of production art, on set photos, and historical robin hood art is included, but is hard to navigate because they play as a timed slide shows without any control over changing the image.
Adventures of Robin Hood is great entertainment for the whole family that hasn't lost its charm in 65 years. The warner dvd is one of the most complete extra packages i've seen. The beautiful print and bucket load of extras are unheard for a film this old. Ruby behlmer's interviews and commentary present the most indepth look into a film i've seen.

785497,4,6304111258,"1.  This review is focused on the film's original and historic film score as presented in this DVD-Video (DVD-V) release.  The DVD-V contains two discs of a quartet of recent discs released on DVD and CD marking the 65th anniversary of the film (see reviews of the film's music on CD release Marco Polo 8.225268 and DVD-Audio release Marco Polo 5.220501).
2.  The Adventures of Robin Hood (TAORH) was Erich Wolfgang Korngold's (EWK) first (and only) score for a motion picture filmed in color (using the three-stripe Technicolor process then crossing over from experimental shorts to features).  This is also the first film score to be broadcast pretty much intact, live, and on coast-to-coast radio (with Sir Guy of Gisbourne, recently recovered, narrating the story) in 1938.  You can hear that broadcast on Disc 2.  For Warner Bros., TAORH was the studio's first release of a full-color feature and the first with a budget of such magnitude (around two million USD all told which is pretty close to 200 million in today's movie-inflated dollars).
3.  Disc 1 contains much (but not all) of the original sound track (OST) processed for the first time in Dolby Digital which yields a spectacular restoration!  Disc 2 includes a number of improvised excerpts from film scores played, hummed, and ""sung"" by the composer along with a bit of chatting (mostly protesting) by EWK-I believe this is the first time Korngold's voice has been heard in a commercial recording (shades of Garbo!).
4.  There are some problems with the audio recordings presented on this disc set.  For starters, while the OST on Disc 1 contains most ""major"" cues (but not in their entirety), many others are missing (starting just a few minutes into the film).  Given the history of how the OST recording was rescued from obliteration in the proverbial eleventh hour, we are indeed fortunate to have what we have.  However,  the cues presented on this disc are synchronized with a silent version of the film.  This means that they end up being separated by all sorts of pauses (while dialog is occurring).  Presenting a chopped up version of the OST as an adjunct to a de faco silent movie seems pretty dumb.  Only those with an academic interest in matching cues with film scenes MAY find this of value-say about five folks on the entire planet!  Next we have the ""live"" radio broadcast on Disc 2.  This appears to be a complete version (at a little over 28 min), but it suffers from print through and wow&flutter, especially at the beginning.  Given these tell-tale signs, this presentation does not sound like it was directly derived from original studio records.  Perhaps of greater interest is that the miking/mixing is also decidedly different (and much improved) from an earlier, shorter version released on CD (Facet 8104, 1987, available from Amazon.com) which really sounds like a live recording!.  So are we really hearing a live broadcast on Disc 2 or a post-broadcast studio recording?  Finally, we have the ""Erich Wolfgang Korngold Piano Session"" also on Disc 2 (called ""Korngold Scoring Session"" on the back of the slip case) broken down into fragments from 12 listed film scores (and a few notes and bars from other ones).  Although not acknowledged, all fragments come from a tape made in 1951 at a birthday for and at the home of Mr. Ray Heindorf (Music Director for Warner Bros.) with the composer as the honored guest (Heindorf also made the recording).  (One fragment, ""Love for Love"" from ESCAPE ME NEVER, 1947, has appeared on at least three CDs and one laser disc, with the source usually not clearly acknowledged.)  No fragment exceeds 2 min 30 sec, and several are less than 30 sec long.  Fragmentizing as opposed to just running the tape end to end also seems pretty dumb.  It is simply not the way to enjoy  an impromptu session of Korngold at the piano.
5.  Bottom line:  Buy this DVD set for the film (and supplemental video materials), but NOT for the OST and related recordings.

The story is engaging, the action is suspenseful, and the ethical issues are thought-provoking.  In addition to a wonderful score, there is even a bit of English history available if one cares to absorb it.
My children were mesmerized by this movie when they were younger, and I always enjoyed watching it with them, marvelling at the quality of the production, lamenting that current fare can't hold a candle to its quality.  I am so happy there is finally a DVD; our VHS is worn out.

 - Maid Marion and Robin Hood, respectively
Still one of the best lines between love interests in cinema history. I've been watching this movie since I could talk. When the VCR would boot up, I'd put on my blanket/cape, leap on my plastic rocking horse, grab my cardboard sword, and act out the best Robin Hood movie ever made as it played out on the screen.
'Course, I don't do that any more (not sober anyway), but when I first saw the DVD edition of the Errol Flynn classic, it truly made me feel like a kid again. And that's something that I can say for a handful of other movies, if that many. Many have tried to recreate the magic of this movie over the past sixty years, but none has been able to come close to being as good.
Everyone knows the story of Robin Hood. But this 1938 film told the definitive story of the knight who turned rebel when the evil Prince John and his #1 lackey, Sir Guy of Gisborne (played to perfection by Basil Rathbone) cross the line in villianhood. It's not just Errol Flynn's irrepressable performance as the legendary outlaw that makes the film. Olivia Dehavalen (yes, I KNOW I spelled that wrong) played the slightly unorthadox, for the time, Maid Marion, and the rest of the cast, from Much the Miller to Little John to Friar Tuck were perfectly cast and marvelously performed. It wasn't just the wonderful duels or tense chase scenes, it was the people who populated this world that made you truly BELIEVE, despite the green tights, that this was the true vision of Robin Hood.
The DVD was worth the wait. The video looks better than it has. . . well, ever. There have been numerous restorations on this movie (it was made more than 60 years ago), but this is by far the best. The colors leap off of the screen, from the greens of the forest to the pearly white of Flynn's smile. It doesn't look like a contemporary film by any means, but honestly, it doesn't really need to. Like a good wine, this film silmply gets better with age.
The audio is equally impressive, from the redone score to the cleaned up audio track. Gone are the muffled and indistinct voices of a dated VHS. Every line comes out crips and clear thanks to the digital sound, and the music makes you want to join in the swashbuckling just for the fun of it.
This is a must-have for anyone who enjoys the Robin Hood legend, and especially for anyone who saw Prince of Thieves (ick), just to see what England's greatest archer was really like. They truly just don't make movies like this anymore.",1070841600,7,2538,4.458064516129032

I was completely fascinated by the quality of this film, made 65 years ago, and the restoration. It simply can't be faulted.  The extras are just as good and tell how the film evolved from what  was to be a humble B&W affair, with James Cagney as Robin Hood ( ???), into a Technicolour spectacular with the then, new boy on the block, Errol Flynn.
Just sit back and enjoy it for what it is - a very well made fairy tale movie, with a great cast of legends.

I've watched it more recently, in a colorized version and it's still very entertaining, although now my heart beats very still while watching it. I just can't take it seriously any more, and now prefer Mel Brook's take on the myth.
I've found Errol Flynn a lot more ridiculous but still surprisingly seductive. What a haircut! What a laugh! And what about those tights? ""We're men! We're men in tiiiiights!....""
Too bad I can't stand Olivia's very dated performance any more, her puppy sad eyes expressions, teen age sighs and silly tantrums. She's always over acting.

I've actually worn out my VHS copy.  So I was going crazy for the DVD release, constantly wondering, ""What the heck is taking them so long?""  Now that I've gotten my mitts on this DVD, I KNOW what took them so long, and it was soooo worth the wait.
The picture is crystal clear and the colors are as bright and vibrant as a Van Gogh painting.  I was shocked at how fantastic the movie looked!  I noticed details that I hadn't before--like that when Robin rescues Much the Miller, he (Much, not Robin, of course) is actually bleeding! And that Maid Marian's dresses are GORGEOUS!!  And that Will Scarlet's lute has no strings!!!  (How did I miss THAT??)
The extras on the second disk are pretty cool too.  My favorite was the behind-the-scenes bit where you learn just how real those arrows were.  Basil Rathbone's ""Helmet Tests"" are pretty funny as well.

Disc 2 - Includes 3 hours of everything about Robin Hood, the movie, the stars, documentaries, cartoons, and a most informative documentary about TECHNICOLOR and why even today it still was the best color process ever.

""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" with the incomparable Errol Flynn is one of them. With over a hundred reviews already, there is little for anyone to add.

The sets and costumes--absolutely gorgeous--the archery contest is just one of many scenes where technicolour shows its stuff !
The Directors--Messrs. Keighley and Curtiz could not have brought this legend to life more expertly.
The Music--unforgettable Korngold score.
Add all these ingredients and you have true cinema magic !
Warner Bros--the DVD is marvellous, and the extras on the second disc ( detailed in other reviews ) provide more treats for the lucky viewer. What a beautiful job !

785551,5,6304111258,"""Get it!""
That is my two-word review for this DVD Special Edition.  I saw this classic film as a child with my parents in maybe 1968 or so.  Much of childhood movie-memory is hazy, more of a 'feeling' than a movie critique, but if the movie was fun, that feeling stays with you into adulthood, and prompts you to consider buying the movie on disc.  Since The Adventures Of Robin Hood had such a far reaching appeal, people may remember all of the satire and spoofs it later generated.  There was even a Bugs Bunny episode that borrowed a clip of Errol Flynn swinging into the scene at the end, and the gallant Daffy Duck had his very own WB spoof as Robin Hood.  When I heard that ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" was being remastered for DVD, I instantly thought of all those memories, naturally.
Are you ready for the good news?  All of that is on Disc Two of this package!!  And we also have the movie trailer, not only for THIS movie, but for other Errol Flynn vehicles like Captain Blood, and The Prince & The Pauper. And a documentary on the history of color in the movies called ""Glorious Technicolor"" a full HOUR on the history and magic that is ""technicolor"".  It is almost embarrassing to admit that the special features alone are worth the price of this Special Edition! (I really don't mean to use so many exclamation points, but I spent two nights enjoying various parts of this presentation, and I haven't even gotten to the film itself yet!)
Back on Disc One, the film boasts a commentary from a film historian, and Leonard Maltin presents the masterpiece with a short, a newsreel, and a cartoon just like they did back in 1938!  You can relive that era pretty much just by pressing play and popping some Jiffy-Pop. The only difference might be an improvement on picture and sound:  they have restored the picture, and also the audio.  Apparently they still had the dialogue and the music as seperate audio elements, which allowed for truly pristine renovations!  This film looks and sounds so great, and is so well done, it would warrant the purchase of a DVD player (if you don't have two already)

785552,5,6304111258,"Errol Flynn's at his swashbuckling best in a breathtakingly restored ROBIN HOOD, the cream of the crop in a Warner Brothers DVD set that also includes a grizzled, paranoid Humphry Bogart in THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE and a dancing Jimmy Cagney in the patriotic George M. Cohan biopic YANKEE DOODLE DANDY.
Robin Hood (1938) was originally directed by Bill Keighley and replaced by Michael Curtiz.  The romantic action adventure of the Merry Men of Sherwood Forest who rob the rich and aid the poor also stars Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian.  She has terrific screen chemistry with Flynn, who  got away with wearing green tights and a feather in his cap while not becoming  a joke.  (Kevin Costner in the inferior remake refused to wear tights and still became a joke.)
The two disc set is loaded with extras.  The magnificent score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold (Austria's ""second Mozart"") can be enjoyed in isolation. And there's a dense, amusing commentary by film historian Rudy Behlmer that alone is worth the price.",1065744000,4,1026,4.867816091954023
785553,5,6304111258,"Although James Cagney was the original choice, Flynn proved to be the definitive Robin Hood. It is possible but unlikely that a better portrayal of the 12th century folk hero will ever be filmed. The screenplay is based on the works of Sir Walter Scott. The cast is superb. The direction crisp and sure, once Warner Brothers replaced William Keighley with Michael Curtiz. In the latest DVD version, both image and sound are restored to their original clarity. Apparently no expense was spared to give this film production values of the highest possible quality. Although renowned for his indelible portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, Basil Rathbone could just as easily play the villain which he does in this film as Sir Guy of Gisbourne. His climatic sword fight with Flynn allows both to match wits as well as blades as they make their way throughout the castle. This exciting sequence offers probably the best example of the talents of cinematographers Sol Polito and Tony Gaudio. Special credit should also be given to Erich Wolfgang Korngold's rousing musical score. He also composed the scores for two other films directed by Curtiz and starring Flynn, Captain Blood (1935) and The Sea Hawk (1940).
Given the rapid development of various digital technologies, we now tend to take special effects in films for granted. Almost anything seems possible. Not so 65 years ago when The Adventures of Robin Hood was filmed. Curtiz and his crew had to solve all manner of problems to recreate not only Sherwood Forest but an entire medieval society. What they achieved is stunning. Indeed, forests have played an important role throughout centuries of British literature, from Beowulf to Harry Potter. Being a child when I saw this film for the first time, I was enchanted by the idea of escaping into lush green woods where I could pretty much live the way I wanted to with my friends. Not have a care in the world. I envied Robin Hood and his companions. Many decades later, lush green forests still have for me a special appeal which I really can't adequately explain. Perhaps it all began with this film.
I am eager to observe the reactions of my grandchildren to the Two-Disc Special Edition. Of course, they will have little (if any) interest in the truly special features which include a commentary by film historian Rudy Behlmer, Warner Night at the Movies (1938) introduced by Leonard Maltin, a new documentary, Welcome to Sherwood (2003), outtakes and the studio's annual year-end blooper reel, a ""Robin Hood Through the Ages"" featurette, ""A Journey to Sherwood Forest"" travelog, another documentary Glorious Technicolor (1998), two shorts: ""Cavalcade of Archery"" (1946) and ""The Cruise of the Zaca"" (1952), ""galleries"" which display  historical art, costume design, concept drawings, cast/crew photos, and publicity, and the audio only of ""The Robin Hood Radio Show"" and Korngold piano session.

  There's so much here to rave about, but I'll highlight a few of my favorites.  Disc two is loaded, boasting a retrospective with commentators like Maltin, Behlmer, and Osborne. It is a terrific companion piece to the film and well worth the 35-minutes investment.  During that feature, make sure to pause the DVD to read the actual letter from Erich Wolfgang Korngold asking to be let off the project as musical composer.  Unfortunate affairs in his native Austria changed his mind, leading to one of the great scores in American cinema.  Nice touch that you can isolate that Oscar-winning score on the feature disc.  Don't miss the outtakes either... and the home movies shot by Rathbone and others during filming.
  My only regret is that the never-so-beautiful-as-she-is-here Olivia de Haviland was not interviewed.

785611,4,6304111258,"""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" was the second film to be made based on our hero in green tights. The original silent version starred Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and, although in this version Errol Flynn lacks something of Doug's viceral masculinity (he does look a tad feminine in those tights), Flynn more than makes up for this shortcoming with bravado, charm and dialogue! The film concerns Robin?s (Flynn) attempt to steal from the rich and give to the poor. His run ins with the law, of course, immediately brand him an outlaw to the temporary aristocracy helmed by the evil Prince John (Claude Rains) and his diabolical henchman, Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone). Olivia DeHavilland - long a Warner stock romantic lead, costars as Maid Marianne. At first she abhors Robin?s bravado to which she associates deception, but later learns of his charitable work and succumbs to his sexy good charm. From that point on it is all sword-fights and high comedy in this effortless and masterful swashbuckler from director, Michael Curtiz.
Unfortunately, Warner's transfer is a mixed bag. After a beautiful main title sequence we get several opening shots that are excessively grainy. Here and there the grain structure crops up - particularly in long shots. Because it's not consistent it tends to look glaring when it does show up. Although the negative looks better than ever before there continue to be chips present throughout. Also, there's NO EXCUSE for the aliasing and edge enhancement that crops up every now and then - once again, particularly in long shots. Extras include documentaries, audio commentaries, featurettes, musical outtakes, trailers and oh, just too, too much to discuss herein - almost 4 hours worth. You really get your money's worth with this disc! Bravo!

Basil Rathbone is the perfect foil for Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland an unmatchable Maid Marian. What's interesting is the fact that Alan Hale almost seemed to live the role of Little John; he played it a number of times including the original silent version with Douglas Fairbanks, Snr. Oh and we can't forget Claude Rains as the evil Prince John. What an amazing cast this film had!
The extras befit a king and they seemed to have been robbed from the vaults of time itself to give to us poor film lovers.

785695,5,6304111258,"""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" starring Errol Flynn, Olivia DeHavilland, and Claude Rains is possibly the best swashbuckler ever made--if not the best--and it was made at a time when almost everything its star, leading lady, director, and studio made was blessed with a golden touch.
  Everything about this film was top-notch.  Curtiz was the best action man at Warners.  Flynn was at his dashing best.  The music was made by Erich Wolfgang Korngold ('nuff said) and every bit player at the Warner lot did their best work--especially Alan Hale and Eugene Palette--that might be a mis-spelling.
  The color and the costumes come togehter in such a way that the film resembles many of the full color pictures one might find in an old picture book--this is especially true of the fight between Robin and Little John when they meet on the log.  Note how the camera pulls back and you see the sweep of the action--and this in the days before Cinemascope!  And if some see the film as old fashioned and without some relevant characters for the current audience--as they tried to do with the dreaded Kevin Costner vehicle--well too bad.  ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" remains a classic of its type and well worth the price of a special edition and, trust me, worthy of your time and trouble waiting for it!  Thank you Warners.  Now, how about ""The Sea Hawk"" and (especially) ""Captain Blood""!!!",1062547200,12,1388,4.785714285714286

785697,5,6304111258,"The pinnacle of Errol Flynn's string of swashbuckling adventures...The most expensive film Warners had ever made (until 1938),  and in glorious Technicolor, to boot...The film with the most cherished of Erich Wolfgang Korngold's many film scores...The film that literally set the standard for every 'Robin Hood' and 'Knighthood' movie since...One of the greatest films, not only of the 1930s, but of all time...THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD is, in EVERY sense of the word, a CLASSIC, and the new DVD edition is LONG overdue!

The story of Sherwood Forest's favorite bandit had been a movie staple since silent films (Douglas Fairbanks' acrobatic 1922 version was regarded as one of his finest roles), and the WB,  riding high on a string of hits by Fairbanks' younger and sexier successor, Errol Flynn, knew they had all the elements in place to create a grand entertainment that no other studio could match!

Originally intended for James Cagney, the property had languished for three years, until Errol Flynn exploded onto the scene, and the studio knew they had the actor 'born' to play the role. Not wishing to run into legal problems with United Artists, who'd produced the 1922 film, an original script, incorporating elements of ""Ivanhoe"", ancient legends, medieval ballads, a popular 19th century stage production, and a bit of Howard Pyle, was written by Norman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller (with some uncredited assistance by Rowland Leigh). Casting nearly all of their ""British Colony"" in speaking roles, the studio brought back Alan Hale to reprise his 1922 role of  Little John (an excellent choice, as Flynn and Hale had terrific rapport), casted rotund comic actor Eugene Pallette (Guy Kibbee was the first choice) as a gravelly-voiced Friar Tuck, and Flynn's LIGHT BRIGADE costar, Patric Knowles, as Will Scarlett (David Niven was unavailable). As the villains, Claude Rains played the fey Prince John, and Basil Rathbone (whose duel with Flynn in CAPTAIN BLOOD was a film highlight) was perfection as the villainous Sir Guy of Gisbourne, Maid Marion's Norman suitor, and Robin's arch-nemesis. In the role of  Marion, could anyone OTHER than Olivia de Havilland have been cast? Flynn and de Havilland had already done two films together (and would do four more, after ROBIN HOOD), and their chemistry was so perfect that 1930s screen magazines were always hinting of a romance between the two (there wasn't, despite overtures by Flynn; they remained simply friends, with Olivia and Errol constantly playing pranks on each other).

Not that the production was problem-free; the original director, William Keighley, was axed after the location shooting was completed, as the studio didn't like his approach to the script and actors; Michael Curtiz, who had 'made' a star of Flynn, in CAPTAIN BLOOD, was quickly brought in, adding his sense of drama, lighting (the
'light-and-shadow' climactic duel between Robin and Sir Guy was a Curtiz 'trademark'), and style. Both Curtiz and Keighley would share the 'Director' credit when the film was released.

THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD was Warners' biggest box office hit of 1938, became a multiple Academy Award winner (with the most statuettes of any film that year), and it's luster has only increased through the years, being named as one of the AFI's 100 Greatest Films of All Time. This is a classic that TRULY lives up to the term, and is an absolute MUST for your DVD collection!",1061424000,205,3447,5.088495575221239
785698,5,6304111258,"I'm afraid that the New Robin Hood with Kevin Costner, although somewhat of a pleasant distraction, pales in comparison to the original with Errol Flynn. Flynn was well known for his flamboyance and cocky attitude. It did not endear him to all but most loved his style especially in movies like ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", ""Captain Blood"", ""The Seahawk"", and a few others. In later years his acting in ""Objective Burma"" showed that he was quite adept at more serious roles as well. In this movie even the supporting cast brings a wide array of feelings of sorrow and amusement to this wonderful film. For a two disk set of DVDs with many extras and being a special edition I can't wait to get my copy. For the period it was made the color, music, and sets were incredible.

785699,5,6304111258,"In 1938 Australian-born motion-picture actor Errol Flynn won the heart of Maid Marian (Olivia de Havilland) and defeated his evil foes as Robin Hood in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", a legendary motion picture about a Saxon knight who steals from the rich and gives to the poor oppressed people of England, based on the wellknown english medieval legends. Released in 1938, the film won 3 Academy Awards for art direction, film editing, and musical score, and it was nominated for that of Best Picture. It was also Selected for Registry by the National Film Preservation Board (1995). ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" is listed among Warner Bros. Studio's classic films and biggest hits and solidified Flynn's image as the dashing young swashbuckler hero who always saves the day.
  Robin Hood (played by Errol Flynn) fights against the villainous Prince John (Claude Rains), who took control of the kingdom as regent when King Richard (Ian Hunter) was captured in Austria during his return from the Holly Lands after Third Crusade's end . Prince John conspires with Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone) and certain Norman Knights against his brother Richard the Lionheart so to become a King and oppresses the poor, yet faithful to Richard, Saxons. Robin Hood and his brave men waylay caravans that travel through Sherwood Forest, including one carrying Maid Marian (Olivia de Havilland). Robin Hood woos Maid Marian and helps King Richard regain his throne. Even based on legends, the movie has a quiet accurate historical set and a very interesting depiction of the conflict between Norman conquerors and Saxon vassals, in medieval England.
  In my opinion this is one of the greatest film ever made in Hollywood. Undoubtebly it's the definitive Robin Hood version, where Errol Flynn surpassed Douglas Fairbanks who had played the same role in 1922. Kevin Costner's remake of this movie and newest version (1991) on the same medieval legend, although is quiet interesting and entertaining, seems to be inferior and mediocre  in all comparison to this excellent, and brilliant large-scale epic.
  Flynn's accent, (which sounded very English to most Americans), and the fact that he brought athletic exuberance, dashing good looks, and a sense of boyish fun, made him a natural choice to star as Sir Robin of Locksley. He plays one of his best roles with bravado and charisma ,appearing his great talent that made him a legend.  Olivia de Havilland (who's really of Norman descent!!) gives an other great performance as the definitive Maid Marian, a sweetly beautiful romantic Norman heroine who's loyal to Richard and Robin's love interest.
  Claude Rains, Basil Rathbone, Melville Cooper (the coward High Sheriff of Nottingham) and Montagu Love (as the Bishob of Black Canons) are simply perfect as villain conspirators and Rathbone displays his great talent in swordfighting in the magnificient final fencing between Gisbourne and Robin Hood which is one of the most famous scenes in cinema's history. Great and brilliant performances too from Alan Hale(Little John),Eugene Pallette (astonishing as Friar Tuck), Una O'Connor (Bess), Herbert Mundin(Much the Miller's Son) and Patrick Knowles(Will Scarlett) as Locksley's loyal companions.
  Curtiz's direction is marvellous and authentic, art direction and costumes are splendid, Korngold's music score is unique and the Cinematography Color is astonisingly beautiful so that deserved to be awarded.

A script that begins in frame one and doesn't let up until the final credits roll; a cast that was almost everybody who was anybody <who wasn't working on GWTW {with the exception of Olivia deHaviland> in Hollywood at the time; a score that UNDERSCORES the action wthout overpowering it; and a final version that is among the most arguabaly perfect motion picture ever made.

The real question is ""Has it ever been DONE any better?"" This is a violent movie. Lots of people die from a well-placed arrow.

785767,5,6304111258,"If anyone wants to compare the gritty realism of films in the post World War II era to the nostalgia generated by Hollywood prior to that war, then one need not look further than THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD. Director Michael Curtiz presents a wildly anachronistic yet hugely entertaining view of an age that seems destined to provide swashbuckling for as long as audiences desire to see fancy duelling, archery contests, and eminently believable romance set against a backdrop of ancient urban versus rural sprawl.  Errol Flynn stars as Robin Hood, a rousingly, energetic hero who dominates each scene with athletic ability, macho good looks, a loud voice, and of course, a disarming smile that never seems to leave him, even when the odds are stacked against him.  With his bouncing off walls, climbing of trees, and general derring-do, Flynn set a standard for future action stars who have copied the essential Flynn style, but have failed to master the far more difficult trick of making all that machismo look like plain old fun.  And fun it is.  No one doubts that for even a second, Flynn is enjoying himself enormously.  It is hard to imagine James Cagney, who was briefly considered for the part, as having the requiste joy, even if he had the equally obvious Cagney energy. Olivia de Havilland, as Maid Marian, is sweet and fetching as the Norman ward of the imprisoned King Richard, whose brother John, (wonderfully portrayed by the elegant Claude Raines), revels in the opportunity to plot with his evil henchman Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone).  It was not uncommon for Hollywood to use Rathbone's machine-gun rhetoric as the prototype for a wicked but educated villain that Alan Rickman would later emulate in DIE HARD.  But it was most uncommon to use Raines in a similar vein, since he had made a career of playing trusted psychiatrists and the occasional corrupt prefect of French police.  THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD is a film that places Flynn just as squarely in the bulls-eye of audience interest as he placed his arrow splitting a second arrow in the acclaimed archery contest.  Surrounding Flynn was the balancing of the goodness of Havilland played against the contrapuntal evil of Raines and Rathbone.  Nearly every scene is endlessly quotable and memorable.  It is difficult to top the shadow on the wall duelling between Flynn and Rathbone, while punctuated by such witticisms as (Rathbone): 'You will never leave this castle alive, Robin Hood.'  (Flynn):'After today, I won't have to.'  Then there is the sterling supporting cast of Eugene Pallette as the pudgy Friar Tuck (Robin: 'Don't worry, he is one of us.' Alan a Dale: 'One of us? He's more like three of us.') Alan Hale as Little John and Una O'Connor as Marian's lady-in-waiting shine in their frequent vignettes. Other versions of the Robin Hood legend have been filmed,most notably with Sean Connery as the overage, washed up Robin, but none has come close to capturing the essence of nailing the audience's heart and soul to the screen as well as Curtiz's version, which won a deserved nomination as Best Picture.  Truly, for the short space of two hours, Flynn reminds us exactly what the Golden Age of Film was all about.",1035763200,,3220,4.884403669724771
785768,5,6304111258,"This is probably the very best movie Errol Flynn ever made, and hang the historical inaccuracies (like those vivid aniline colors).

Swift, deftly choreographed action alternates seamlessly with humor and thoughtful moments like Robin's talk with Marian in the greenwood, and all the major elements of the Robin legend are fitted in and done justice to.

At the time in 1938, this film was produced for a then massive $2,000,000, making it the ""Titanic"" of its day. This permitted, in addition to the top notch cast, for first class production values. The sets are amazing and creative, enough in fact that they received an Oscar. Awards also went to the film editing and the exciting film score of Wolfgang Korngold. The movie looks good on the VHS edition I saw it on, except for some grain and lack of clarity with the color. Sometimes, it looked a little washed out (Then again, it was the late 1930s and the infancy of color). Hopefully, this movie is at the top of the list for films Warners needs to give DVD treatment.

785771,5,6304111258,"Rousingly performed, expertly paced, and beautifully photographed, this initial entry in the process of technicolor is a triumph of Hollywood movie-making. Errol Flynn gets the role he was born to play, likewise his foil, the hawk-nosed Basil Rathbone whose eloquent voice and sinister manner penetrate as deeply and lastingly as any rapier thrust and parry. In fact, a whole host of middling studio players find their perfect visual counterparts in this glorious production which apparently was tossed off without recognition of the classic it is. Nor has technicolor ever produced richer splashes of color than in the outdoor gallery scenes and forest celebrations that tellingly oppose the coldly cavernous interiors of the pretender king. (Note also the occasional off-angle camera setups that tend to slip by, but add wonderfully to the action flow.) Like John Wayne, Flynn had a narrow thespic range, but once there, he could be commanding, such that here as the lord of Sherwood, he forever foredooms all attempts at a remake. Viewed sixty years later, the film reminds me of a low-tech, pastoral version of Star Wars -- the appeal is the same, though the Keighley/Curtiz film wins the Jenny Craig no-flab award hands-down. Probably, no film before or since has so expertly mixed action with romance, humor, and solid human values as this one. Nor has any screen experience functioned more effectively in the quest for justice and fulfillment than this apparently light-hearted Warner Bros. entertainment. For once everything cinematic fell into place in the dressed-up scrub lands of southern California, to produce an uplifting fairy tale, which by any measure, should qualify among the all-time best of any film genre.

The first time I remember seeing this film my father took me to a screening at the Museum of Art in Los Angeles, a fitting venue, that was 30 years ago.
I have since had the pleasure of seeing it on the big screen a few more times, and was even able to meet Errol's daughter at one a couple of years back.
There have been many reproductions, and in fact Robin Hood was first played on film by Douglas Fairbanks, but none comes close to the perfection of Errol Flynn's version.
Basil Rathbone is the perfect villian, and at the time one of the best if not the best swordsman in Hollywood, I have heard that he gave Errol a few pointers?? Another perfect bit of casting went to the poor guy who looses the archery tournament to Robin, the guy who get's his arrow split by Robin is the stunt archer on the film and made the split shot himself, this was not a stunt but a real shot, and if you look close you can see that the arrow is not split in two but three! Also, every time you see someone hit with an arrow, it's this same person shooting them with a real bow and arrow from off camera!! Some pretty brave day players on this film.

785846,5,6304111258,"This has been one of my all time favorite movies for years and it simply has never been outdone before or since. This movie, more than any other version, captures the flavor ot the Robin Hood legend. Has there ever been an actor who captures Robin's saucy good humor like Errol Flynn? Could any other actress match Olivia DeHavilland's sweet but smart Marian? Has there ever been such a slinking, swashbuckling villain like Basil Rathbone. Warner Bros. knew a good thing when they saw it which is why this is one of several Flynn/deHavilland/Rathbone teamings starting with Captain Blood.
Like most other movie versions, Robin is portrayed as a nobleman turned bandit to fight injustice rather than the peasant boy framed for poaching. Also, like most versions, this movie borrows heavily from Sir Walter Scott's medieval epic Ivanhoe. The Norman/Saxon conflict is lifted directly from there as is much of Prince John's plotting. The two themes, however, are melded rather seamlessly.
Most delightful is the fact that unlike the other two famous versions of Robin Hood (the 1922 version and Prince of Thieves) this movie shows how most of the main merry men (say that 3 times fast!) were recruited. Not only are we shown the battle with Little John but also the rescue of Mudge the Miller's Son and the tricking of Friar Tuck. Flynn/Robin is a very good loser and this is maybe the most likable trait of his character.
The dialogue fits in perfectly, over the top yet believable when spoken by the talented cast.

785847,5,6304111258,"The Adventures of Robin Hood is one of my favorite movies of all time. But, like so many others, I wish it would come out on DVD so I can enjoy it with pristine sound and near-perfect picture quality for many years to come.
Flynn, Basil Rathbone, Olivia de Havilland, Claude Rains -- what a cast! There are even a smattering of Hollywood's most famous character actors included here, such as Alan Hale Sr. (father of the Skipper on Gilligan's Island).
This movie got me started on a lifetime fascination with fencing, sword fighting, swashbuckling and the triumph of good over evil. It's a classic from start to finish.
But, again, I ask: Why so few Errol Flynn DVDs? Granted, he wasn't the most accomplished Hollywood actor. But he was one of the most famous -- and this movie, The Adventures of Robin Hood, is certainly one of Hollywood's finest.
Please, whomever holds the rights to this movie, please give it to us in DVD format. I've been wearing out too many VHS copies!",1002240000,2,976,4.614942528735632
785848,5,6304111258,"That exchange in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" was first drawn to my attention because it was used in the frontspiece of a trashy book about Flynn's being a secret Nazi spy. Well, I don't know whether he was a spy or not, but Errol Flynn was the best swashbuckler I've ever seen, and this movie is the crowning acheivement of his career--maybe one of the ten greatest films released by Warner Brothers, too.
While Flynn is the star, I must admit that my love for this film is rooted not to his performance, but to those of Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains. After all this time, I still can't determine which actor does the better job. Rathbone is Sir Guy, Robin Hood's nemesis, who hates him not only because Robin is a threat to the usual evil usurper plans, but because he senses correctly that Maid Marion is in love with Robin Hood. His striking good looks are used to full advantage--in some scenes, such as when Robin is sentenced to hang, Rathbone actually looks like a figure in an El Greco painting. And of course, there's his skill with a sword. The prolonged duel at the film's conclusion would never have been as good if Rathbone weren't so agile and malicious. When my three-year-old nephew happened to see this scene, he became hopelessly hooked on swords and armor! (Although, to be sure, Robin and Guy wear no armor in this scene, but toddlers tend to overgeneralize sometimes.)
As for Claude Rains, he's a wickedly good actor! His Prince John is a wily schemer, overthrowing his brother's regent by playing on others' greed for advancement. He himself never lifts a sword, but he manages to get very far on the metal and mettle of his co-conspirators. Just listen to the way the words just trip off his tongue: he's one jaded Plantagenet, all right.
It's a beautiful-looking film, too, as if a Howard Pyle or NC Wyeth book just popped up and came to life. The costumes, the sets, the cinematography--everything comes  together for a feast for the eyes. Topping it off, Erich Wolfgang Korngold's Oscar-winning score underlies every scene magnificently.
If you're looking for a film for a special family holiday or a romantic evening with your honey, or just a night in by yourself with a pizza and a pint of ice cream, look no further than ""The Adventures of Robin Hood""--and by St. George, you'll see I'm right on target!",1002067200,3,2338,4.647342995169082

785851,5,6304111258,"This film is still thrilling for children and intensely nostalgic for grown-ups. 1938's THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD remains one of the most popular adventure films for all time. The film gives the legend of Robin Hood a light, satirical edge. Everyone in it is defined clear to the bone. Errol Flynn with exuberant aplomb plays Robin with a mixture of daring-do and self-mockery.  It's good vs. evil all the way with Olivia De Havilland as Maid Marian, Alan Hale as Little John, Ian Hunter as Richard the Lion-Hearted, Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains as the villains. The rousing film's direction is credited to Michael Curtiz and William Keighley, the former having replaced the latter. In a way this is a forerunner of the modern popular screen action hero. There is no situation as hopeless as it looks that Robin cannot escape from. This should be credited to Flynn's tongue-in-cheek approach to the role with all and his athletic screen presence. Composer Erich Wolfgang (CAPTAIN BLOOD, JUAREZ, THE SEA HAWK, KINGS ROW) Korngold's score won an Academy Award. The fantastic colour photography was the work of Cinematographers Sol Polito and Tony Gaudio. When we think of the best of Flynn we think of this role. I hope someone somewhere is seeing that this film is being preserved for future generations.

They look so lush, vibrant, colorful, and awe-inspiring, especially in the Sherwood Forest. There's also some moments of humor in the movie, just like in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or any other action/adventure film.

785926,5,6304111258,"Errol Flynn dosen't actually use a buckler, but you get the idea. This is 'the' Robin Hood movie; don't waste your time on Robin Hoods with Midwestern accents.  The political implications of Robin Hood are usually thought to favor the Left.  This movie shows Robin in his true color - as a counterrevolutionary, fighting for restoration of the legitimate government, for the rights of yeomen farmers not to be taxed to death, and against usurpation and tyranny.  Thomas Jefferson could have written much of this script.  The un-PC Robin uses weapons to poach deer, confronts the local government over their abuse of power, and his democratic manners come out in sharp contrast to the rigid formality of the Court Party.  Errol Flynn fits the part to a 'T,' and the viewer can well imagine him, had he been born seven centuries earlier, actually being the title character.  Olivia de Haviland positively glows, and portrays the spirited courage and character that her faith and breeding were supposed to instill in every scene.  Not as often mentioned is Richard the Lionheart, who, although absent until the final scenes, is so much larger than life that he dominates the screen when he appears.  The duel scene, the use of shadows, and the many-splendored pagentry have been celebrated often enough to make any further praise redundant.  Taken as a whole, this is the best movie of its' kind, and the standard against which this writer has measured all others since it became his childhood favorite. -Lloyd Conway",977184000,2,1514,4.952569169960475
785927,5,6304111258,"This is one of my very favorite movies. It works on every level. The story is a classic one, and Hollywood, for once, re-created the story on film with a minimum of re-writing. The scenes are colorful. The music is well done. There's lots of action, some clever dialogue, and there's no doubt who are the good guys and who the bad guys are. Finally, Robin Hood is the quintessential role for one of Hollywood's classic actors. Errol flynn simply fits the part perfectly. It's as though he was made for the role. The other members of the cast take their parts very well, also. This is a fun and entertaining movie, suitable for viewers of all ages.

785928,5,6304111258,"The tale of Robin Hood has always been a guilty pleasure for me since pre-adolescence.  I have read various versions as well as viewed several different film adaptations.  As far as film goes, I'll state my preference for the 1938 version starring Erroll Flynn and Olivia de Havilland.  The Adventures of Robin Hood is a cinematic classic.  You can keep the Costner version and let me have this one.  Erroll Flynn is a dashing hero who inspires the people to rebel against the evil Prince John.  Olivia de Havilland is a lovely Maid Marian.  I also like the casting of Alan Hale as Little John. I'm young enough that my first exposure to Hale was as the Skipper on Gilligan's Island.  It was amusing to see him as a younger, thinner man.  These subjects are loyal to King Richard who is away at war.  The story of Robin Hood is well known so I'll take a moment to discuss the spectacular film quality.  This colorful film is beautifully shot.  I can remember numerous times being impressed with the sheer brilliance of the cinematography.  The film was ahead of its time in effects.  The costumes were gorgeously flamboyant.  The acting was superb.  There has never (in my estimation) been a better film translation of this immortal tale.",971308800,,1238,4.662037037037037

There is not a flaw in the entire 1938 film or any of its elements.  Since they struck a new printing a few years ago, like many others, I have been holding off on buying a VHS home version for that DVD to come out.
 The distributors continue to put out meaningless junk while this one languishes in the can.  Most of us will play this marvelous film whenever we feel the need of a mood pickup.  This is like a glass of cold lemonade on a hot summer day, or a warm hearth in the midst of a frozen winter.  It is an oasis for the soul.
 One can see the wonderful storyboard behind the scenes, and the N.C. Wyeth inspired sets and characters in every minute of this magic film.

785931,5,6304111258,"Apologies for the repost - but a movie of this calibre deserves more than one review!
All too often today is the epithet ""classic"" applied to simply a popular film. More often than not such ""classics"" are unable to  bear the weight of such esteemed company and lapse into obscurity. Not so  The Adventures of Robin Hood (TAORH) which, despite being over sixty years  old, remains a triumph of the Film-Makers craft, and should rightly be  considered the yardstick by which all other classics are measured. The  reason for such a claim is simple; everything is perfect. The score won an  Oscar and drives the film along with vigour: The direction, although  interrupted during production, is faultless and the colour, glorious  Technicolour, is so rich that it makes even current day productions seem  lacklustre: The script is witty and concise with innumerable quotes and the  plot simple, convincing and urgent.
But the real success of the film is  the casting. From the dashing Robin (Errol Flynn), through the beautiful  and demure Marion (Olivia de Havilland) , the comical High Sheriff  (Melville Cooper), the dastardly Sir Guy (Basil Rathbone) and sly Prince  John (Claude Rains), not to mention the minor leads and supporting players,  the cast acquit themselves of their acting requirements in style.  It is  only when you stop to consider the original choices for some of the leads  (e.g James Cagney for Robin) that you appreciate quite how bad the film  could have been, but also how great it is. The characters ARE characatures,  that much cannot be denied, the ""baddies"" having few redeeming features,  the ""goodies"" hero's in every sense. But they are characatures carved with  such skill and thought by actors who knew their business so well, that we  find ourselves drawn into the film, doublet and all. For Romantics, of  course, but I challenge any open-minded individual to watch TAORH and not  come away entranced by it. It is for these reasons that I nominate TAORH as  the best film ever made.
The choice is simple really; if you're looking  for a complicated pot-boiler of a film that will be good to while away a  couple of hours and is ""of-the-moment"" then look again. But if you're  looking for an experience that will linger on after the final credits have  rolled, an amalgam of everything good about film-making, and want, just  once, to see what perfection looks like, The Adventures Of Robin Hood is  for you.",956880000,4,2441,4.878048780487805

Very few films can be viewed dozens of times and still  delight. This is one of them: the evergreen, classic Robin Hood that  preserves all the high points of the legend, and adds more than a dash of  Hollywood. Newer films may be more graphic (read: bloodthirsty), but none  are as sumptuous as this one. For adventure, action and sheer beauty, you  won't beat this version: try to pick out the layers of design detail ...  and pick up the vivacious soundtrack music.

The musical score is rousing, and the  technicolor brings it to life vividly.  Of course, it's hard to imagine  anyone else as Robin Hood than Errol Flynn.  He plays the role with just  the right combination of heroics and athleticism.  As usual, he and Olivia  deHavilland sparkle opposite each other, and a familiar and welcome cast of  character actors only add to the magic.  In particular, Claude Rains seems  to have a lot of fun in his role as the villain.

786029,5,6304111258,"A true classic Technicolor flick from 1938.  No part was better suited to Errol Flynn than that of Robin Hood. The picture is full of movement, some of it dashing in the fine romantic costume style, some of simply sprightly.  The excitement comes from fast action--galloping steeds, men swinging Tarzan-like down from trees, hurling tables and chairs, rapid running sword-play, the sudden whiz of Robin's arrows coming from nowhere to startle his enemies, etc.  Everyone is matchless in their roles: Olivia de Havilland is the perfect Maid Marian sweetly innocent and fair-minded. Rathbone is at his ruthless and cultered best as Sir Guy and Claude Rains is the insidious, scheming Prince John (he and Montague Love look as if they stepped out of a history book!).  Alan Hale makes a boisterous Little John (he actually looks at home in the woods) and Una O'Conner is Marian's scatterbrained maid. The others live up to the picture-book quality of the film, which is the supreme virtue of this classic and except for some tedious and modernish love-making, it keeps moving along at a beautiful pace.  There is some charming colour in the movie, and quite a lot of brilliant dazzle.  Director Keighley originally took the crew to Bidwell Park in Chico, California for the Sherwood Forest scenes; but co-director Curtiz thought the scenery lacked majesty and took the crew to the area around Lake Sherwood(!) west of the San Fernando Valley. The film cost an enormous (for 1938) 2 million dollars and the result is one of the most popular films of all time.",947116800,,1555,4.916030534351145
