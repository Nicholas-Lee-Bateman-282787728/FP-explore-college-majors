1016809,4,6305326673,"Police suspect that a brutal serial killer has patterned the murders of three women on a series of novels written by Kate Saunders (Kim Delaney), whose writings focus on similar crimes -- and whose paraplegia is the result of a vicious attack by the same killer years earlier. With a new novel about to be published, Kate finds herself at the murderer's mercy as his attacks begin again.

VERY GOOD Suspense movie! I was lucky enough to get this one for $1.00 and LOVED IT!!",1135555200,,474,4.576470588235294
1016810,4,6305326673,"One of the underlying themes of this well done made for TV films is what responsibility should a creative person take for the work they create?  In this case, a female mystery writer has written two best selling novels about a serial killer named the Gargoyle.  Both books have seemingly prompted a copy cat killer to mimic the crimes of her novels.  The general populace says the author should be just as guilty as the killer.  While this is not something I agree with (I've read several serial killer books and have yet to kill anyone), it makes for an interesting underlying theme, and ultimately, a reason for the murders.  Kim Delaney stars as the novelist, who was rendered disabled after her encounter with the first copycat killer.  She has secluded herself in an out of the way cabin, and doesn't have much of anything to do with anyone, except her personal assistant, Jenny, and her personal trainer, BJ (a rugged John J. York).  When the copycat killings take up again after her second best seller, the FBI moves in, which also includes Delaney's former lover, agent John Grady (Scott Kraft).  A sleazy tabloid news anchorman also figures in the plot, and director Fred Gerber keeps us guessing in this suspenseful and well acted chiller.",1107216000,9,1249,4.776744186046511
1016811,1,6305326673,"This movie was much better the first time I saw it, when it was called Copycat with Sigourney Weaver, Holly Hunter and Harry Connick Jr.
Horrible acting by all the supporting characters, too many half-baked and poorly explained threads all over the place, incompetant police and FBI agents/procedure, and not really that hard to figure out who the killer is.
Bringing a degree of disbelief suspension to movies is one thing, but to think that if the FBI and Police from 9 states were so unable to find any suspect, that they wouldn't have run the backgrounds thru on everyone involved with the case is just stupid.
Police aren't that dumb.
And it was kinda funny seeing Kim Delaney who is obsessively paranoid and over-protective of herself all movie long to instantly drop all her wards the moment the movie is about to end and you/we know the killer is about to show up.
Yea that would be the killer who gave himself away halfway thru the movie with his [crummy] acting.",1055548800,5,972,4.656976744186046

7888483,4,6305326673,"Growing up in the 90's I watched a lot of Lifetime movies. There was nothing greater than sitting in front of the television watching Lifetime. To this day, I have a soft spot for the movies that I watched when I was younger. This is one of them. Closer and Closer is the story of Kate played by Kim Delaney, who is an author whose books inspired a man to kill. An encounter with the killer left Kate paralyzed from the waist down and she became a recluse afterwards, preferring to live alone in a state of the art cabin. When a new serial killer pops up and connects with Kate, she is reunited with her former flame who is an FBI agent, who she cut out of her life after she was injured. With every kill, the killer is getting closer and closer to Kate.

Kim Delaney is good in the movie, but by far my fave was Sheriff Dwayne Jackson played by Peter MacNeill. His interactions with Anthony Sherwood who plays FBI Agent Luther Clay were great to me. Kim Delaney's love interest is kind of forgettable. Peter Outerbridge shows up as a news reporter who is slightly slimey in his interactions with Kim's character. The 90's internet stuff is so funny to see.

Overall, not the best of movies but enjoyable.",1451779200,,1205,4.375

7888488,4,6305326673,"Not one of Kim Delaney's greatest, but it's still an interesting variation on the locked room mystery.  In this case, the lock is our heroine's paralysis, and consequent confinement to a wheelchair, as well as her fear of leaving the ""security"" of her home.  When a serial killer adopts the persona of her best-known villain, and begins killing others while stalking her, a suspenseful damsel in distress story develops.  Despite her fierce independence, her disability forces her to turn to others for help in this crisis, while trying to find out who the killer is.  He targets her with recorded threats over the internet, and the fear factor rises nicely till the villain is revealed.  Sadly, the ending, not so dramatic, but pretty good nonetheless.",1254614400,,753,4.992
