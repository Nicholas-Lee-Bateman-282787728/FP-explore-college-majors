8064853,3,B0009PBY7O,"Ah, the 1980's....So here you have a typical Corman cheapie riding on the coattails of the very successful Mad Max/Road Warrior pictures. That is, minus the incredible edge-of-your-seat car chases, death defying stunts and a plot! No, the ""story"" here is pretty weak, to be honest, and unfortunately the attempts at high octane action and violence didn't do the best job of keeping the yawns away...I'm probably making it sound much worse than it really is, but I suppose for those so inclined it wasn't too bad and was worth a look at least for the unintentional laughs (that, and the busty chick that runs topless for three quarters of its running time!). I don't think i'll be reaching for this one from the shelf very often...",1512432000,,730,4.755905511811024

8064859,3,B0009PBY7O,"If you are like me, you probably saw this movie advertised as a coming attraction on other VHS tapes from the 80's and thought, ""hey, that looks good!""  Well, ""Wheels of Fire"" (a.k.a ""Desert Warrior,"" ""Pyro,"" etc.) is a pretty good example of the 1980's Post-Apocalyptic genre.  Man, Reagan had people scared....anyway, here goes....

  Gary Watkins (the only male given billing on the VHS tape's sleeve) plays TRACE a former Ranger gone solo, trying to make it on his own in a post-apocalyptic world (hereafter known as ""PAW"").  At least I think it's a PAW; there's no intro or anything, just Trace and his cool car pulling up to a big meeting of people dressed like they are extras in that old Duran Duran video ""Wild Boys.""  Yeah, so Trace is your typical PAW anti-hero: clad in black, stubbly, with a me-first attitude.  He does have a cool car though: it shoots flame, has a Batmobile-like flaming exhaust and guns and stuff.  And his sister, ARLIE, is pretty hot.  As the video sleeve brags, Arlie is played by ""Playboy Centerfold"" Lynda Wiesmeier, a blonde who would not be considered very sexy in the 00's, as she has more curves than Mulholland Drive.  I like curvy women, but even I think she would be better suited wearing a horned helmet and metal breastplate and singing ""Die Walkure.""  But I digress.

  Trace runs afoul of the gang known as the Nomads, who are led by an evil warlord named SCOURGE (Joseph Anderson).  See, Arlie has a ""boyfriend"" (or whatever they call that in the PAW) named Bo, who looks like 75% of the guys I went to High School with.  He also acts like them as he quickly loses a metal pipe match with a member of the previously-mentioned Nomads.  Trace intervenes, kicks the Nomad's butt and has to deal with the rest of the gang.  This leads to the ineffective Bo screwing up again and getting himself and Arlie captured and raped (yes, you read that right, both of them) by one of Scourge's lieutenants, Skag (who looks suspiciously like Blue Oyster Cult's bassist Eric Bloom).  Bo is mercifully eliminated, and Arlie is taken to the Nomad's headquarters to be raped again and again.  Yes, the PAW is a bad place and yes, Arlie is played by a former Playboy Centerfold (so she's in this movie primarily to be naked), but in my opinion, all the raping should have been left out and more cars blowing stuff up added in.  Just a suggestion. However, Arlie does eventually get her revenge.

  Anyway, Trace has to rescue Arlie and along the way runs into another devil-may-care misfit named STINGER (Laura Banks), who has a cool pet hawk.  Stinger and Trace have a little affair amidst the violence for some reason, probably because Gary Watkins had it in his contract that all the women in the film had to be topless in at least one scene.  Trace runs into various characters & mutants along the way and kills a seemingly never-ending stream of Nomads before finally wiping them all out and saving his own little corner of the PAW.  He then drives off into the sunset the way he drove up: alone, with cheesy synth music playing.

  All-in-all, ""Wheels of Fire"" isn't the worst movie ever made and should really appeal to fans of the PAW and of early 80's junk.  Keep in mind, this ain't for kiddies what with all the violence, especially the violence against women.  Still, it plays as kind of a ""Day In The Life"" of a PAW hero and those who are training for this life, alone in a hut out in the desert, should buy it and watch it just to know what to expect.
