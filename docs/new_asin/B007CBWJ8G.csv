8514459,4,B007CBWJ8G,good dvd but only 15 minutes that's why it is cheap good metalcore live from unearth brian newmeyer,1407369600,,99,4.555555555555555
8514460,4,B007CBWJ8G,"The characters, cast, and settings are all fairly engaging. There is the usual exaggeration, but overall it's a decent series. Season Two feels more self conscious and tries too much to be serious at the expense of a more understandable story line. The depth (such as is suggested between 12 year old Philip and very elderly Marjorie) is sometimes hard to accept, however the dissolution of friendship between Lockie and Eggs is handled reasonably well. It is a bit much to see Lockie looking a foot taller and far more mature than the season before.",1378944000,,550,4.8
8514461,5,B007CBWJ8G,"Mesmerizing, hypnotic and tantalizing. Mass hysteria to its limits. This kind of blind fanaticism is not far from over. Nazism may be a closed chapter in history, but religious fundamentalists and  political extremists are getting stronger.  Those who don't know the history, are condemned to repeat it. Be warned, history repeats itself......",1212278400,4,343,5.576923076923077
8514462,2,B007CBWJ8G,"Being a moderately big fan of Unearth, I bought this mini-DVD a while back, put it in, and turned it off halfway through the first song. The audio is horrible. The video is good; good angles, energetic crowd and band, but the audio is dreadful. I let my friend, who had never heard any of Unearth's song before, watch this DVD, and he said something along the lines of ""that's just noise""! And from just watching this DVD, you'd get the impression of Unearth actually just being pure, plain white noise. Which is a shame, because they actually write some interesting, complex metalcore tunes. And the backstage stuff isn't very much of a bonus either. So is three live songs with horrible sound quality and about a minute of backstage footage worth it? Not unless you're completely obsessed with Unearth. Hopefully they'll release a full length DVD with much better quality sometime, but this little thing isn't worth it, even for $4.",1125878400,7,934,4.771604938271605
8514463,3,B007CBWJ8G,"this dvd is like...10 minuets long.  it contains three tracks, mic'ed live recordings, and they aren't really very good.  the discription promises 'unearth live music, and backstage antics'.  The 'backstage antics' consist of like A minuet of crap in a little box on the side of scolling credits...  Oh well, i was entertained for 10 minuets because i really like unearth, so basically, if you like unearth, and don't mind spending like seven bones on this dvd (which is cheap...) then go for it, its pretty rad for fans.",1124409600,3,521,4.820224719101123
8514464,2,B007CBWJ8G,"the tracks have been edited in a studio, and the songs aren't available in audio format (can't listen to it on a cd player).  Still worth the price, but not great.",1119744000,,163,4.258064516129032
8514465,4,B007CBWJ8G,"As a big fan of Unearth this was a muct have DVD, espically for the low price.  However there needs to be a longer running time on it and it's not as good as DVDs from such artists as Throwdown and Bleeding Through.  Buy this DVD.",1103241600,,230,3.9782608695652173
