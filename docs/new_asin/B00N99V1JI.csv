6618662,5,B00N99V1JI,"I am very taken with the Father Brown series,  particularly with this cast.  Fun characters.  What I most appreciate about this mystery series is Father Brown's true Christian foundation of grace and mercy and forgiveness.",1453420800,4,222,5.285714285714286
6618663,5,B00N99V1JI,"It's the late 1950's. The Cold War is in full swing, and in this season it even makes itself felt in sleepy Kembleford, Father Brown's village. There are tons of humor amidst the murders and some great characters. A couple of Father Browns recurring cohorts have expanded their roles in Season 3. These new Father Brown mysteries, with Mark Williams as Father Brown, are cozies with an amateur sleuth, PG and definitely not police procedurals.

""Father Brown Series 3"" originally aired in January 2015 with 15 episodes. Each episode is about 45 minutes, so with a complete series 3 you get some 675 minutes of mysteries  that's a lot of viewing!

The set offered on this amazon page will not work on the usual USA Region 1 DVD player. But if you have a Region 2 player or All-Region player, you're in good shape.

The Region 1 DVD's were originally divided up into Series 3 Part One (the 1st 8 episodes) and Series 3 Part Two (last 7 episodes).
Part One is listed on amazon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Father-Brown-Season-Three-Part-One/dp/B00SXFIHIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Father Brown: Season Three Part One</a>
It has two episodes I especially recommend. ""The Last Man"" (episode 5) has a poignant ending. And ""The Lair of the Libertines"" (episode 8) is quirky and very funny.
In Part Two (or the Complete Series 3), I really liked ""The Judgement of Men"" (episode 10) with its good plotting, including Nazi art theft.

The DVD set presents the episodes in 16:9 anamorphic and 5.1 Dolby Digital. English subtitles are available. There is no DVD bonus content.

TRIVIA: Father Browns home is the village of Kembleford in Gloucestershire County. Kembleford is made up, though the real Gloucestershire County does have a town named Kemble. The original stories place Kembleford in Essex, but the TV series moved it west. Gloucestershire (pronounced GLAU-stir) shares a border with Wales, and it includes part of the Cotswold Hills. Stratford-Upon-Avon is not that far away from it, to the north-east.

I have been a fan of this re-booted Father Brown series since the beginning. I think it could make the leap from GREAT to EXTRAORDINARY (a l Foyles War) if the episodes could be expanded to 90 minutes each. As it is, though, I recommend this series to mystery lovers.

If you missed the first two seasons, you're missing some fun murders!

We did some research and discovered that the DVD is for Region 2 (England).  We are in Region 1 with Canada.
