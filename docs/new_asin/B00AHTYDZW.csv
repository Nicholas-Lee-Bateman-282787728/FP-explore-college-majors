8551801,1,B00AHTYDZW,"I will not belabor the main detriments of this movie since everyone else has. My main issue with this is that it is being sold like it is an actual movie that may have something to do with a dollhouse. Sounds good to me. Anthologies are always fun. But it has nothing to do with a dollhouse and isn't a real anthology, as others have pointed out.

The only one of these three movies worth watching is ""Dollman Vs Demonic Toys"" which is an okay movie, and at an hour long,
Haunted Dollhouse's abridgement of it still includes half the picture. The other two cannot have as much said for them. You barely see the monsters in those and then only in disjointed, unconnected scenes that are overshadowed by the crap scenes used to set up the premise of the film (if that can be said to have happened at all).

I bought mine from Full Moon direct and really wish I had read the reviews here first.

Just one more nail in the coffin of the once great Full Moon name.",1388793600,,959,4.258241758241758
8551802,1,B00AHTYDZW,"This is not a feature film. This movie is three film episodes in one movie that are not connected. I noticed in the first film, which I liked, that the plot continuity went to pieces early on. People who are kicked off the castle grounds by the owner are subsequently eating dinner with them.

The reason why these stories are so disjointed is that they took full length features and cut them down to 30 minute episodes, so each episode has about an 50 minutes to an hour missing from it.

Feature one is called ""The Protectors"" -from the film""Skull Heads"".
Feature two is called ""Worry Dolls""- from the film ""Dangerous Worry Dolls""
Feature three is called ""Dangerous Toys""- from the film ""Dollman vs. Demonic Toys"" Imagine coming into the middle of a third film in a series and trying to figure it out.

If for some reason you have a short attention span and feel a need to watch the Cliff Note version of horror films, this is it, a sad way for Full Moon to rip us off.

8551803,1,B00AHTYDZW,I rented this FREE from th Redbox and I am so happy I did not waste any money on this movie but I would like my hour back! This film was backyard typejust plain horrible. Dont waste your money!!!,1363824000,,195,4.0256410256410255
8551804,1,B00AHTYDZW,"This has got to be one of the lowest budget, worst acting movie I have ever seen. Dont waste your money.",1362700800,,104,4.0
8551805,2,B00AHTYDZW,"Charles Band and Full Moon Pictures continued their perverse obsession with puppets and dolls with this trilogy of terror.
Production values are typical Full Moon's low budget and poor effects trademarks.  B-movie stalwarts Tim Thomerson and Tracy Scoggins half-heartedly participate and each story is hopelessly predictable.  Only its unintentional laughs keep it from being a total disaster.",1362268800,,393,5.87719298245614
8551806,1,B00AHTYDZW,"One of the worst Full Moon movies I've ever witnessed, and possibly one of the worst horror movies. As other reviewers stated I did not make it through much of this movie. I jumped off the boat right after the random 2 cent nudie scene with the chick who looks like she got ran over by a Mack Truck. That was approximately 15 minutes into this disaster. I feel bad having spent $1.00 at Redbox on this garbage. I pray for your soul if you actually buy this for $12.99",1360195200,4,467,4.2
8551807,2,B00AHTYDZW,"If there was still a gong show, this movie should have been on it.  I stopped it (gonged it) after 20 minutes.  I gave it two stars because it was in English with Spanish mixed in.  They shouldn't charge for this bad of a movie, I think it could be a background show if people were in a room talking, otherwise, it was a waste of 1.31 at Redbox.  It is my fault for not doing my due dilligence on the reviews here first.",1359417600,,420,3.9642857142857144
8551808,1,B00AHTYDZW,"This film has nothing to recommend it. It is just one step away from being one of the Grindhouse films advertised at the beginning of the disc. It is cheesy soft porn. The three episodes featured here have some abrupt editing jumps, as if sections of film were just randomly left on the cutting room floor. The acting is amateurish. The plots are inexplicable nonsense.

The only good thing about this film is the picture on its jacket. That's a good, haunting photo collage. You can just tear this off and leave the disc itself behind in the garbage.",1357776000,3,551,4.565656565656566
8551809,1,B00AHTYDZW,"Why oh why did I rent this?  I was hoping at least for some goofy fun but all I got was  a silly, tedious slog through three stupid short stories on one DVD.  The acting and directing are atrocious and of course the writing was a joke.",1357689600,2,235,3.9574468085106385
