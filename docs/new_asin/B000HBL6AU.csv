8138001,5,B000HBL6AU,"If there is only one reason to own this DVD, then it would have to be witnessing Bjork - Superstar if ever there were one! - go all shy toward the start of this show when Charlie Rose (whom I'm guessing is a fan of her work) reads out some of the media comments of her work and career. Gosh, Bjork is such a truly magical creature. My heart both soars and breaks every time I see her and hear her speak!

This provides a good insight into her as both a person and an artist.

It centers around the release of the VESPERTINE album for the most part and, whilst I knew a lot of this stuff, it was still awesome to see/hear Bjork tell it all with her customary charm, naivetty and humor.

She is without a doubt my favorite artist (along with Grant Morrison) and, whilst I know that I don't need to persuade any hardcore Bjork fans to buy this, nevertheless, let me urge anyone and everyone to purchase this!",1171670400,4,905,4.189655172413793
