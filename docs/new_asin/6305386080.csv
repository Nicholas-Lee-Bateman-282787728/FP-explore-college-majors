7892464,3,6305386080,"The sound is just horrible. My friend Dave had this $20,000 Sony stereo system and I bought this Welcome to My Nightmare video to surprise him one day. Both of us are huge Alice Cooper fans. Dave likes the Greatest Hits CD the best, I love ""Welcome to my Nightmare"" and ""Billion Dollar Babies"" alot. So, we popped it in and woah!!! Even with his eq's, filters, and different components, it sounded mediocre, borderline crappy. On my stereo (Sony 500 Watt receiver), I don't have any filters or eq's, the audio sounded like crap! PLUS the video footage itself is horrible!!!!! Bad lighting, bad footage, cheap cameras, etc...I was so PIST bcz I paid like $15 and wasn't able to return it!!!!! SKIP THIS ONE ALTOGETHER UNLESS YOU WANT TO HEAR ALICE'S SONGS SOUNDING LIKE ITS COMING FROM AM RADIO. Like I said, I love Alice alot and especially the ""Welcome to my Nightmare"" album, but this video just upset me so much. Its just sitting there on my shelf and has been for about 2 years.",1080432000,,982,4.553672316384181

In his day, he was denounced for lyrics as refreshingly honest as these.  His own unique brand of darkness is still pure fun to listen to.",978912000,,258,4.468085106382978
