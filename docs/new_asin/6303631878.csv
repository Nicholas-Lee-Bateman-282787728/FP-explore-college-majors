7852449,4,6303631878,"this was a gift for Christmas stocking, and was real hit. we saw it on tv a long time ago and enjoyed it. Now it is a holiday tradtion.",1371254400,,135,3.689655172413793
7852450,4,6303631878,"My almost 4-year old is taking skating lessons and absolutely loves ""The Nutcracker"", whether it is a ballet or an ice show. She demands we put this video on almost every day, and dances to it. We very much enjoy it too! Of course, there is room for improvement, but it is a beautiful production, too bad it cannot be seen live and is not on tour anywhere.  The only thing is that it is obvious that all the leading skaters are not pair skaters, all the pair skating elements are pretty much absent.  But the show is a delight to watch!",1324339200,,536,4.245098039215686
7852451,2,6303631878,"Look elsewhere if you are interested in specifically seeing the Nutcracker, whether performed in skates or toe shoes. Although most of Tchaikovsky's score is (laszily) played, the skating stars are wasted with indifferent choreography and perfuctory camera work. There is no invention, no tension, no lightness. The production is just dumped there as another Christmas ""special"" to be forgotten on December 26. Believe me, there have been terrific ice productions of this ballet.",1269648000,,479,5.575342465753424
7852452,5,6303631878,"Oksana Baiul deserved every honor as Olympic champion.  This is a prime demonstration of her artistry.  Understanding the art of figure skating, this aspect alone deserves 5 stars.  The rest of the cast are excellent too.  One critical observation is that the costuming is heavy.  There is too much fabric flying around which takes away from the lines of the skaters.  It's cute and designed for the time and place, but for skating it's too heavy.  I highly recommend this Nutcracker On Ice performance.",1230508800,,503,4.916666666666667
7852453,3,6303631878,Nutcracker on Ice by Oksana and Baiul Is very nice excect that it was spoiled by the Sugar Plum Fairy all through the program!! It should have been kept in its own segment as in the origional delightful story.,1173657600,,209,4.384615384615385
7852454,5,6303631878,"I greatly enjoyed this and highly recommend it.  It is especially effective in the second half.  Highlights include the performance of the mouse king (spectacular flip!), the performance of the Arabians (wonderfully choreographed), and the pas de deux.  It's a pleasure to see the delight Oksana Baiul takes in her own performance and in the production as a whole.",1135555200,,364,5.135593220338983
7852455,5,6303631878,"Although probably directed at the childrens' audience market this adult and two others enjoyed it as if we were children again. Delightful,refreshing and historically valuable to see the two primary skaters at an earlier age. The narrator was slightly objectionable but this should not detract from overall enjoyment.",1007164800,,317,5.625
7852456,5,6303631878,"My opinion is a little bias, but it really was a GREAT show. I teach skating when I'm not doing shows and the kids always tell me how much they love the show. The smiles that you see on our faces are real, everyone involved was so wonderful, we were a family. ""Nutcracker"" was a dream come true, my favorite professional show. I had far too much fun as the bratty little girl in the blue dress. The brillant choreographers made this timeless classic a combination of grace and humor. Even those who aren't into ice skating will find it entertaining. Not your run of the mill ice show.",998784000,8,584,4.36697247706422
7852457,5,6303631878,"Oksana's beauty and skating really captivated me.  The music of Tchaikovsky is beautiful, and the cast of skaters provided a very pleasant program.  I've watched my video several times.",998092800,,185,5.344827586206897
