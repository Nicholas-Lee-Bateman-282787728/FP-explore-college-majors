The story itself wouldn't have been bad if it had some depth, but it was shallow and devoid of any real human emotion beyond selfishness. The problem is that it goes from A to Z in about 15 minutes... It starts out promising enough, for about 5 minutes. An obviously loving and playfully affectionate romp between a couple who have been married for most of their adult lives, and because suddenly the realization kicks in that they are old (not having yet reached 60), ten minutes later (seemingly) they are separated, and about 20 minutes later (seemingly) they each commit infidelity at roughly the same time.

I realize that I'm giving away a spoiler or two here, but there is absolutely nothing about this story that resonates, in my opinion, with real life. How do you go from a long standing loving and supportive partnership to separation and infidelity in roughly the blink of an eye? And their three children fare no better, they are superficially one dimensional and absurdly dull, and while Isabella (Mary) is still a luminous woman, here her character is utterly selfish (even stupid) while at the same time resonates a complete disconnect from life. William's Adam fares only slightly better but does seem more human. For me, the only real bright spot in the movie is Joanna Lumley's character and the actress that plays Mary's (Isabella) mother.

I rarely regret a purchase, but this one fell completely flat.",1396656000,,1490,4.8392156862745095

8561908,1,B00B332J6G,"In spite of William Hurt and Isabella Rossellini, it's quite dull to watch. Too much attention is paid to how things look instead of how fluently the story is told. There doesn't seem to be enough depth to a narrative that offers so much potential for development. Some scenes are nice but as a whole the movie doesn't come together.",1369699200,,333,4.566666666666666
