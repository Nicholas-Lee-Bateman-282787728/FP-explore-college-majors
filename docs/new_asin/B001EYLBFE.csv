I have over 5,000 movies in my collection, bought and burned as well... but this is the worst picture quality dvd I have ever seen EVER!!!!! Its a wonderful movie with a exceptional cast great and thoughtful script but what ever truly evil criminal transfered this which is clearly an extreamly poor 2nd or 3rd generation vhs video tape copy by hooking together his grandads Vcr and a cheap dvd burner with car jumper cables! I got ripped off by this don't make the same mistake. I think if you are looking at this then you problely know how great this movie is and that its one of Bill Paxtons best and most honest perfomances.... realy everybody in this film does quite well like Mark Hamill and Ben Kingsley but for me gentleman that plays the android is my favorite and I'm ashamed that I can't remember his name off hand but as you can tell he didn't receive billing on the cover wich is quite a shame scince he and his relationship with bill paxtons character makes the film. DON'T BUY THIS VERSION KEEP LOOKING FOR THE remastered DVD VERSION THAT IS A DOUBLE PACK THAT FEATURES (SLIPSTREAM/ABRAXIS). I just bought it on here to replace this dvd wich I guess I can now use as a drink coaster!",1314662400,4,1266,4.414529914529915
