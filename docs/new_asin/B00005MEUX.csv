7945406,5,B00005MEUX,Finally my Sorcerer Hunters DVD collection is complete and i love this series!,1445904000,,78,5.076923076923077
7945407,5,B00005MEUX,"6 eps is far better than the 3-4 eps other anime offers. The humor isn't as broadly painted as Excel Saga(throw-everything-at-the-audience-something-will-stick)--here we get to know the characters & their quirks producing the laughs. There's also manga to back up the series(for those of us who want more & can take the spattering of nudity which makes it into each of the graphic novels, but not the anime)so the characters have their own histories. One problem is the dvds aren't numbered making it harder to track the order without refering to the inside of the package. This one is the 3rd with Eps 15-20. Everything is coming together for the climactic battle with Zaha Torte(very cool Japanese voice-Banjo Ginga), one of the cooler anime bad guys. The anime doesn't get to go into it, but the manga brings out his reasons & his willingness to become the devil to do what he feels must be done to save the world. The Hospital of Love is typical Carrot after any girl but Tira & Chocolate & the rest of the crew largely unseen. Mother's Day is sad. While the character profiles in the extra's titles suggest Marron has something for Gateau, Illusionary Darling comes closer to the manga's verion of everyone(Gateau, Mille) flirting with Marron, but Marron not responding--Marron's fantasy is for Carrot to attain his fantasy.",1027123200,4,1329,4.911111111111111
7945408,5,B00005MEUX,"Girls, you ever hear the phrase ""don't judge a book by it's cover?""  Well, that totally goes for this series.  Take no heed of Chocolate and Tira on the cover, this anime isn't totally for guys.  Infact, I'm a girl, and I and all my best friends LOVE this series.  But enough about the appealing to females.
This series is about a group of people who could be called the Sorcerer Police.  In a world where Sorcerers and magic users rule, unjust happening happen to regular people, and whose to help and right the wrongs?  Girl worshipping Carrot and his group of other magic users sent by the Goddess, Big Mamma!
So if your looking for comedy, action, and magic, and are sick of watching Slayers over and over agian, give this a try!  It doesn't hurt that the opening and ending songs are really catchy as well.",998092800,8,811,4.4391891891891895
