4868161,3,B005S9EK1S,"Being the only male in the audience on a Friday afternoon, pretty much tells you what you are getting with ""The Lucky One"". As the lights came up as the credits rolled, I turned around to see myself standing among fifteen to twenty women, some were teared up, some weren't. Nicholas Sparks, the writer of the novel, has made a career off of books and movies that touch people's hearts. The biggest of those was ""The Notebook"", but ""A Walk to Remember"" & ""Message in a Bottle"" were notable as well.

While most of Spark's novels are tailor made for women, I found ""The Notebook"" to be something that everything could relate to with its theme of Alzheimer's. ""The Lucky One"" on the other hand, had many opportunities to reach a broader audience but brush stroked over those. I enjoyed ""The Lucky One"", but for some reason, it didn't quite affect me like ""The Notebook"" did. That may be because it didn't spend enough time in certain areas.

First of all, Zac Effron (High School Musical, 17 Again) plays Logan, a survivor of Iraqi freedom who stumbles upon a picture of Beth (Taylor Schilling) lying in a pile of rocks after a night raid. All we learn about Logan happens in the length of the opening credits. The problem with ""The Lucky One"" may just have been that the characters were all too interesting. There is depth to the characters, but the montages that are used to get all the information across are empty and unexplored. Sparks also did a movie called ""Dear John"" that had so many montages, I thought I was watching a two-hour commercial for Hallmark. I hate montages.

In the first four minutes of the film, we see Logan survive some war situations, see him return home with a picture that saved his life and see that he has a lot of post-traumatic stress. All of which is very interesting, but it happens in a montage and we lose all the emotion from it.  Once the movie gets going though, to its credit, we start to see some real emotions coming out, especially from Schilling's character. She does an outstanding job portraying her sadness and her struggles as a single mother dealing with a lot of issues. Effron, on the other hand, is stuck playing a character that had his best parts portrayed in montage and for the rest of the movie, plays the perfect man. What else would you expect?

""The Lucky One"" is just an okay movie that gives everybody that enjoys these type movies exactly what they're looking for. It has two beautiful people falling in love. It has drama. It has beautiful cinematography. It has all the clich&eacute;' things that make a movie like this safe from criticism and just outside the realm of memorable. As rich as the characters were, I just wish some of those character traits would have been fleshed out more.",1335139200,86,2754,4.578093306288032
4868162,4,B005S9EK1S,"A marine in Iraq discovers a woman's photo, and the circumstances of the find save his life. He survives the tour and sets out to find her. Upon locating the lady, a romance ensues, in spite of her jealous ex-husband and the marine's failure to reveal why he has shown up. This is another Nicholas Sparks romance adapted for the big screen, and it is perhaps the best one yet. The film contains all the classic hallmarks of a romance: a handsome hero, a beautiful lady, a villain, and steamy romantic sequences. Men should enjoy the efforts of the film's quiet and strong protagonist to seek out his destiny, while women will like the tale of a strong woman who is struggling with a bullying ex and her feelings for the newcomer. This is a good movie for an evening out with your significant other.",1335139200,,798,4.510344827586207
4868163,3,B005S9EK1S,"At this point, it's become way too easy to track the formulaic path of any Nicholas Sparks adaptation. Vaguely sketched characters lust for love in the midst of barely defined, supposedly trying circumstances, with very little real drama to be found. Those looking for sexual sizzle tend to walk away hot, bothered, and unfulfilled. Doesn't matter which no-name director takes the helm, the creative results are the same and roughly the same amount of people show up.

Ironic that Sparks' cookie cutter, conveyor belt brand of romance so frequently revolves around the idea of destiny and fate. The Lucky One stars Zac Efron as Marine Sgt. Logan Thibault, the luckiest soldier serving in Iraq after finding the photo of a mysterious blond beauty buried in the sand. The image serves as his good luck charm, surviving many an altercation that left his squad mates dead. They apparently weren't smart enough to carry photos of hot chicks in their back pockets. They're a real life saver.

Discharged, Logan sets out to find the woman he thinks saved his life. After a disastrous stop at home where his PTSD is flared by a pair of rambunctious nephews, he pulls a Forrest Gump and hoofs it(along with his ""Awww"" inspiring doggie pal) from Colorado to idyllic, unnaturally sparkling North Carolina, where he meets Beth(Taylor Schilling), the woman from the photo and owner of rundown dog kennel. After the prerequisite misunderstanding and Logan's unexplained inability to reveal the truth, he winds up scooping puppy poop for Beth and her wise old grandmother(the excellent Blythe Danner).

Sparks typically ladles on the melodrama like thick gravy. Beth has a precocious 7-year old son who bonds with Logan over chess and playing the violin. She also has a lunk-headed jerk of an ex-husband(Jay R. Ferguson), the town sheriff's deputy who uses his law enforcement and legal connections to make her virtually untouchable to the opposite sex. Did we mention that her grandma is sick, and that her parents died while she was young? The only thing that could make it worse is if she were to fall in love with a studly stranger and invoke the violent ire of her ex-hubby. Oh..wait, that's exactly what happens.

If there is a Michael Bay of romance films, Nicholas Sparks has proven time and time again that he is it. He nails some of the bigger emotional moments, especially as Logan and Beth's courtship leads to a surprisingly steamy(for a Sparks film, anyway) shower scene. However, Sparks fails in all of the small details that make a story feel complete. Beth's ex is cartoonishly evil, reminiscent of the bullies you'd see in 80s teen comedies. As usual there are very few real stakes involved, and the resolution is never in doubt even for a moment. One thing in Sparks' favor is that he tweaks the inevitable death of a major character, veering away from his norm and raining hell on the unfortunate victim in a way that was the most unexpected aspect of the story.

The only thing that saves the film from total disaster are strong performances by Efron, Schilling, and Danner. For Efron, he's in over his head when trying to act like a hardened soldier, his laughable post-traumatic rages getting the film off to a rocky start it struggles to overcome. He improves later on, showing a real growth as an actor and overcoming a weak kneed script. Sparks novels, and movies for that matter, target the female audience but more often than not feature poorly realized women characters and worse performances. Schilling is a welcome breath of fresh air, equal parts beauty and strength, giving Beth a dignity we don't get to see often enough.

The Notebook is always cited as the best of his adaptations, and that is true to some extent because of its mesmerizing stars. However, a look back at it reveals that Sparks was merely setting the stage for a career of weak plots and poorly defined, sappy characters. The Lucky One continues that trend, appealing only to the Sparks converted looking for an easy, comfortable, love story.",1335139200,3,4030,4.86734693877551

4868211,3,B005S9EK1S,"I watched this movie because I felt like watching something fairly innocuous and sweet - and it certainly was that.  The story is an old one, just re-worked here and there for today's world - Marine comes home, has a difficult time adjusting - sets out to meet a girl whose photo he has seen, and walks all the way to her little place (because he likes to walk....uh...okay) = goes to work for her because her Grandmother says ""he looks all right"", and then, the typical things begin to occur - there's an ex-husband who of course dislikes him intensely, there a little boy who of course takes to him, the girl herself is initially mistrustful, etc.  I like Zac Efron, he's a proficient actor as are all the actors in this, but really, the screenplay itself is sort of a typical formula for this type of genre and fairly predictable.",1520640000,,833,4.473684210526316

4868258,3,B005S9EK1S,"(Minor Spoilers) To call a spade a spade, this otherwise well-shot and well-acted film is undeniably a consummate chick flick, no? ;) ""Logan"" (Zac Efron) returns to the States from his third Tour of Duty with the picture of a woman (""Beth,"" Taylor Schilling) he doesn't even know that was dropped by a fallen soldier, and he makes it his mission to find her and thank her because, according to him, she's the reason he finished his Tour.  There's an unexpected war connection with that picture and that mystery woman (which I won't give away) that goes hand-in-hand with an expected simultaneous romantic connection on his return, all while Schilling and Efron seem to vie for who's the prettiest (and it's a tough call, LOL).  And the film has more than its share of seemingly overly sentimental scenes (i.e., the church and tree house scenes), but its merits dwell in Efron, Schilling, and Blythe Danner (Gwenyth Paltrow's real-life mother), who make it all mostly gratifying, though it's in a Big-Pharma-commercial kind of way.",1514592000,2,1030,4.9479768786127165

4868262,1,B005S9EK1S,"My buddy and I do The Greatest Lie with Pete & Taylor podcast and we give one another movies that we enjoy that the other hasn't seen.
Now, we agree with one another when it comes to comic films but otherwise Taylor is into chick flicks and Im into action movies and there we clash.

I watched this movie upon his challenge... The very premise of this movie is creepy and just makes me feel like uh...
So, heres the set up: A marine is in war and they raid a building. Several of them die. He doesnt and he comes out of the building and sees a picture sitting on the ground in the distance and walks over to retrieve it out of curiousity... an explosion goes off behind him killing several of his fellow marines. He looks at the picture and its of a beautiful lady (who happens to be in prison in Orange is the New Black) and decides its his good luck charm. Throughout his tour he stares at the picture eerily wanting to be with the woman in the picture. She and her brother, who was among the marines killed, were best buds and he had her picture on him as a reminder to be safe and make it home. Well, this creepy marine finished his tour and decides to travel to his fellow (now deceased) marines hometown and try and bed his sister.

Thats the set up. Creepyville. Yeah... Nah dude, youve got problems if you're going to move to some random town hoping to bed a woman that was in a picture you found on the ground.

What Ive shared isn't really spoilerish as thats just the set up. A lot of cliche, silly, nonsensical things happen. Youll laugh! Youll cry! Youll want it to stop.",1512691200,,1584,4.221122112211221

4868329,5,B005S9EK1S,"This DVD was an economical and surprisingly good purchase. ""The Lucky One"" with Zac Efron is an excellent, somewhat unusual and satisfying movie. Efron portrays a strong, stoic, capable, resourceful, and caring young man recovering from a troubled past.  As a former Marine who miraculously was spared from almost certain death, he has sought escape, relief, and a specific goal in a cross country journey on foot and alone. His ultimately unfolding relationship with the beautiful young but skeptical daughter of his lady employer, the owner of a dog training and kennel service, develops sensitively and beautifully. Efron's character's emotional reserve and control, and his development into a gentle but strong, sensitive, fun-loving friend and eventual lover are inspiring to watch. In this movie Zac Efron has grown into a surprisingly matured actor compared to his teenage efforts.

I had read and enjoyed Nicholas Sparks' ""A Walk to Remember"" several years ago. This DVD has given me an opportunity to  see that movie. It's well acted and produced, not quite as entrancing as ""The Lucky One"", but a pleasant portrayal of another Nicholas Sparks story of a beautiful young romance .",1498521600,,1189,5.214659685863874

Telling her that he found her picture on battlefield and it brought him luck doesn't seem like a big deal to say or ""find the words for"".

I didn't like the ending, I would have preferred maybe something like grandmother forced to shoot the ex husband while he was hurting Beth.

4868436,4,B005S9EK1S,"This is my second review of a Taylor Schilling film - I'm doing a study of her filmography.  The film is a classic romantic drama with a happy ending.  Zac Efron plays a hunky lead, but his role is somewhat limited in range:  seek, pursue, prove credibility, overcome emotional and physical challenges, and secure the girl - all typical male lead ingredients.  Taylor Schilling is well-cast as a divorced woman with resentment issues and fierce independence, who later feels threatened, betrayed, and finally, able to accept love again - quite an acting range.  Ms Schilling is more than up to the challenge, and offers us a remarkable variety of emotions and expressions - a hint of what we have seen in full flower in the series ""Orange is the New Black"" NETFLIX series.  She carries most of the critical scenes in this film, and maintains a sustained credibility as a young woman and mother who is afraid to leave her grieving comfort zone, but is finally able to leave it behind and take a chance on new love.  I've read reviews of this film where people express dissatisfaction with her portrayal of Efron's love interest.  I think the reason may be that she out-acts him throughout.  Ms. Schilling's interview in the bonus feature offers us a charming view of this actress who is grateful for the chance to play the role, and considers herself ""the lucky one.""",1487462400,,1366,4.729957805907173

Reviewing the movie on it's own merits though, it just wasn't that good.  The storyline had some pretty significant disconnects, the characters weren't that engaging or endearing, and the whole plot just moved through very slowly.

I spent more time looking at the pictures then I did getting involved in the storyline which really seemed like nothing I hadn't seen a million times before with small twists. The story simply could  have been so much more than it was. Maybe it was just too much for one short movie so there were too many places to skip around.

The only reason it has more than one star is because I have to admit watching it to the end even though it was painful.  As a fan of OITNB I was curious to see Taylor Shilling. The acting was not good at all, I was never able to forgot for a second that acting was happening. I was never drawn into the story. Even the seasoned Blythe Danner was stiff and shallow. The sets are so limited and the sap is over the top. I couldn't help but roll my eyes when the SPOILER >> footbridge scene began. If you like this kind of nonsense, you'll probably love this. It's too ""shiny and cute"" for me.",1468108800,,691,4.043795620437956

4868975,5,B005S9EK1S,"This is a very sweet film that touches your heart. Nicholas Sparks has a real talent for telling beautiful stories about people in desperate situations finding love and rescue. The Lucky One tells the story of a young man who finds a photo while off at war and believes it to be a key to his destiny and a luck charm that kept him alive from a bomb attack. He travels the country and finds the woman and begins a passionate love affair. The story is about fate and destiny, but really it's above love and overcoming obstacles to find it. I think Nicholas Sparks wrote the book, turned film here, to speak less to fate...but more to the actions we take to ward of those people who would try to deprive us of happiness. The film's actors do a great job at expressing passion for each other and conflict once the truth of the photo (which led Efron's character to her) comes out.

If you enjoy a good love story, this is for you.",1466035200,2,926,4.291428571428572

4869135,3,B005S9EK1S,"I chose The Lucky One to meet a requirement for an adult reading challenge at my local library. I'm not a big fan of mainstream fictional romance, and the book was as dreary and sugary as I expected, but the movie moved at a faster pace. I found the differences between the book and movie interesting. I'm guessing that budgeting and filming resources were the reasons the story location was changed from North Carolina to Louisiana. I grew up in Louisiana, and have relatives in North Carolina, so I'm familiar with both states. Hollywood often greatly exaggerates the Southern Louisiana accent, but this movie didn't. I also preferred the plot lines and character personalities in the book. (Hollywood does love its stereotypes!)  In my opinion, Blythe Danner and  young Riley Thomas Stewart stole the movie. The characters really should've been sweating more, and there wasn't enough mud after that tropical storm!",1462752000,3,917,5.066225165562914

Just seem like things was taken from really good to extremly bad in just one scene..  But to tell you the truth the movie is better than the book. The book is just slow in alot of parts and boring.

The script is cookie cutter, two integral scenes in the book are left out, which lead to a writing of a script that wasn't in accordance with the book- I thought the book was well done, if a bit predictable.  This movie is miscast in almost every actor but Zeus, and truncates the actual story so badly, its just a feel good mush.  If that's what you want, so be it.  The book should have been the step by step of the screen write.

4870382,4,B005S9EK1S,"The Lucky One
  The Lucky One took me by surprise.  I am not used to Romantic Dramas, seeing many more of the sister genre, Romantic Comedies.  I found that it worked quite effectively thanks to the magnetism between the leading man and leading lady.  Star Zac Efron has been in show business for years, never mind that he is a young man still.  He stared in Charlie St. Cloud (thumbs up), 17 Again (which I saw on TV the other night and liked), and all three versions of High School Musical.  His co-star is Taylor Schilling (recently in Atlas Shrugged pt. 1) who appears in this film to be a thin and fit country girl rather than some too beautiful for words Hollywood moving mannequin.  She plays the proprietor of a dog boarding, training and boarding business.  Her characters mom is played by Blythe Danner, real life mom to Gwyneth Paltrow.
  In the film, the two lovers are still in their mid-twentys but both of them have had enough travel on hard roads to be wary.  Logan, the Efron character, is a Marine returned from combat.  He has a degree of PTS that he is dealing with but mostly he is obsessed with a photo he found at a battle site, a photo of an unknown woman.  In picking up the photo, he moved out of the danger zone of an incoming rocket which would have surely killed him.  He wants to find the girl in the picture and thank her for saving his life.  The girl is Taylor Shilling.
 The romantic part of this movie is the agonizingly slow courtship with the two young people-getting to know one another, to appreciate one another and eventually coming to trust one another enough that when the inevitable breach comes we can believe that there is enough to the relationship that the breach can be patched.  It is very sweet to watch.  The attraction between the boy and girl seems completely genuine and real.
 Zac Efron has officially come out from his cute teenager stage as an actor and convincingly portrays a Marine combat veteran.
 Scott Hicks, the director of this well done romance, added nothing to the world of movie making but he also made no glaring errors.  He let his actors act and they did not let him down.
 This three and a half saw blade romance turned out to be a pleasant way to spend an hour and 41 minutes.  It is rated PG-13 for some sexy stuff and a disturbing relationship between a boy and his father, the ex-husband and child of the Taylor Shilling character.  This will be a profitable venture.  The film is budgeted at $35 million and took in $27 million in three days.",1432944000,,2521,4.437908496732026
4870412,5,B005S9EK1S,A very nice movie to watch. A romance for my wife and enough action to keep my interest as well. A good storyline with some humor and a surprise or two.,1432944000,,152,3.935483870967742
4870413,5,B005S9EK1S,Nicholas Sparks writings and stories made into movies is wonderful.,1432944000,,67,5.8
4870414,4,B005S9EK1S,"I'm giving this movie 4 stars (not 5 and I'll explain why later).  I loved the story; the supporting characters were excellent, namely Blythe Danner as the grandmother and Riley Thomas Stewart as the young boy Ben, but mostly because of Zac Efron.  He does a wonderful job portraying Logan, a quiet soft spoken ex-marine setting out on a mission to find the girl in a photo he found, who he feels saved his life and now considers her his angel.  When he finds her, he cant quite find the words to tell her why he is there but instead, he finds some peace and solitude working for her family's dog kennel business.  The training and care he puts in with the animals seems to be a sort of therapy for him after three very grueling tours in Iraq.  Zac Efron has come a long way from his High School Musical days.

The reason I didn't give it that 5th star is specifically because of the female lead, Taylor Schilling.  While she seems to be a very fine actress, she looked and acted much older than her part.  Like she was more of a 30 something snooty divorcee and didn't match up at all with Efron's character of Logan, who was identified as 25 years old.  The extras on the DVD touted the amazing chemistry between them but I just didn't see it.  It was kind of creepy in that it felt like she was the older teacher seducing her younger student.

All in all a good movie, but it would have been better had they cast a younger actress or at least an actress that could look and act younger to match up better with Zac Efron.",1432857600,,1523,4.253472222222222

And having some one poke a gun in your face is a sure way to trigger a kill reaction, not a disarm the guy, no matter who he is.

Those things aside, I enjoyed the movie.  It is not a Oscar winning movie, but it is a good show and worth a couple of hours of your  time to watch.  Besides, I am a Blythe Danner fan.",1430092800,,647,4.015748031496063

4870834,5,B005S9EK1S,"As a big Zac Efron fan, I always expect a lot from him.  He does not fail to disappoint.  In fact, I think this is one of his best performances of his young career.  His character has come home from 3 tours in Iraq and finds himself searching for some meaning in life.  Upon sheer coincidence, or fate, if you'd rather call it that, he searches and finds the answer to a puzzle he feels he needs to solve, the origin which started in the war.  Zac plays a marine with all that entails.  However, being Zac Efron, you can't help but fall in love with his character.  With his toughness comes tenderness and complete sincerity that makes this move special.  Zac's character feels like he's the lucky one, but in the end it turns out that the answer to the mystery is really the one with good luck and fortune.  Zac connects with each character he interacts with on a level that most actors couldn't pull from themselves.  Even those who hate him in the film, can't help but like him on some level.  Zac's relationship with the young son of the woman he meets, as well as her grandmother, while not central to the plot, add layers of meaning and color that make you smile and cause you anguish at the same time.  Zac can say so much with his eyes and face without even opening his mouth.  This subtlety never fails to pull me in.  The visuals and settings in the movie are lush and vivid, which again, make it a better movie.  All of the performances in ""The Lucky One"" are very good, but in the end, this is Zac's movie and it soars because of him.",1425945600,,1546,4.2646048109965635

4870921,3,B005S9EK1S,"I really liked the story line; I'm a romantic and a red-blooded American, so anything with a soldier as the lead part is on the top of my list; Zac Efron's role was believable and sweet--a shy, quiet guy who wants to protect and defend everyone (and he's a dog lover, too).  How could you not love him?  And Taylor Schilling was a pretty and innocent girl who loved her little boy (another adorable character); she, too, was pretty believable in her role.  Her grandma looked young enough to be her mom, but hey, that didn't even bother me.  What did annoy me was the very graphic and lengthy bedroom scenes; no, there was no nudity, but very little was left to the imagination with them grabbing at each other's clothes, groping and humping all over each other, even if all you saw was a bare back or spread legs.  I don't rent or buy a PG-13 and expect to get saturated in sex scenes, even if partially hidden from the camera.  I'm not a prude, but I would not want my 13-year-old watching a movie like this with me.  Too bad the producers thought they needed to add that to make a movie that would sell.  It has a sort of happy ending (but did you have to kill the competition, folks?) and overall is a really good movie, but I'm not keeping it because of the blatant sexual innuendo, if that's what you'd call it.",1424649600,,1317,4.303643724696356

4871117,5,B005S9EK1S,"This time I saw the movie first and read the book second. That Zac Efron was the romantic lead *may* have had something to do with that (I admit Im a fan from his High School Musical days).

The movie has some additional twists that the book didnt. Often when this happens Im not impressed but in this case I thought they added to the story. For example, theres more of a connection between the main character (Logan) and the dead brother (Drake). It was fun to discover the extent of that connection at the same moment the characters did (and pretty inventive how the connection was made).

In the book, Logan and the bad guy (ex-husband and deputy Keith Clayton) have a run-in early in the story that is completely separate of Logans involvement with the heroine (Elizabeth). But by and large, the ex-husbands character is consistent in both: the character you distain (especially when Elizabeth proves to be nave when it comes to him).

One thing thats missing in the movie is the influence of Logans (dead) best friend, Victor; that bit of history would go further in helping the viewer (of the movie) understand Logans inner turmoil and confusion related to the photograph of Elizabeth and the real-life Elizabeth.

In the book, the dog plays a much bigger role than in the movie. I imagine it might have been hard to train a dog to do all that Zeus does in the book. But it was a heart-tugging detail in the book that I probably would have missed in the movie had I read the book first. And it does impact/change how the story ends.

Sparks novels are often tear-jerkers, and I was leery that he might kill off the good guy and/or have an ending that was otherwise not happily-ever-after. But in this respect, although the details of the climactic scene were slightly different, the book and movie actually came to the same conclusion. I really enjoyed both book and movie.",1417824000,,1879,4.597014925373134

4871135,3,B005S9EK1S,"The Lucky One

Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks: when people see this phrase they know right away what this movie will be about. A passionate love story between two soul mates that must face the tragic sickness or death of a loved one. I personally have seen all of the movies produced that were based on the best selling novels of Nicholas Sparks. I was very eager to watch The Lucky One because I am a huge Zac Efron fan back when he was in High School Musical.

The Lucky One is about a Marine who has served three tours in Iraq and found a picture of a girl that happened to have saved his life from a huge explosion. When Logan (Efron) returns home he makes it his life mission to find the girl in the photo and thank her for saving his life. Of course when Logan finds the girl, whose name is Beth, they fall magically in love with one another.

Cinematically this movie was okay. Its a classic romance movie so there isn't much to see and hear other than the beautiful landscapes and the dyadic sounds of nature. The different shots used really captured the intensity of several scenes however. The intimate moment between Logan and Beth, the extreme close up on their faces, showed passion and love and touched the hearts of the viewers, including mine.

Overall this wasn't a bad movie. If you are a fan of love stories this one doesnt disappoint. If I had to give this movie a rating I would give it a 7.5 out of 10 only because the plot of the story was predictable and I would have liked there to have been a twist or an unexpected scene in the story to have made it a bit more enjoyable.",1417478400,,1605,4.252459016393443

4871373,2,B005S9EK1S,"The Lucky One is just another typical love story.  In this film taken from Sparks book a marine must get away from his former life and go on a journey to find the woman who's photo he felt saved his life during his time serving in the Iraq war.  The Lucky One was a novel written by Nicholas Sparks and the screenplay for the film was written by Will Fetters.  Scott Hicks was in charge of directing this film, prior to this he was known for directing Shine and No Reservations.

Logan (Zac Efron) is a marine serving in Iraq.  During one of his tours out there he sees something shining on the ground so he picks it up, he realizes its a photo of a girl with ""keep safe"" written on the back.  As he is reading this his unit is attacked and most of them die  He credits his survival to the girl in the photo and calls her his guardian angel.  He spends some time trying to find the owner of the photo but he can't so he just assumes that they were killed in battle. Once his tour was over and he goes back to the States he is unable to adjust back to civilian life because he is still haunted with everything that happened during the war.  So he decides to analyze the photo and see if he can figure out where it was taken.  He discovers that in the background of it there is a landmark which means the photo was taken in Louisiana.  So he tells his sister (Courtney James Clark) that he is leaving for Louisiana to go find the girl in the photo. Once out in the area where the photo was taken he learns that her name is Beth (Taylor Schilling).  When he meets her he tries to tell her what happened but unable to deal with the events he can't say anything and she begins to wonder why he is there.

The Lucky One

Without him saying anything she just assumes that he came to apply for the job opening that she has at her dog kennel.  He tells her yes that is the reason he is there, but Beth gets a weird feeling about it and goes to her grandmother (Blythe Danner) to tell her to kick him out.  Unfortunately for Beth that plan went south because the grandmother likes him and decides to give him a chance and hires him.  Not that long after he has begun working for Beth he makes a connection with her son It isn't long that he makes a connection with her son Ben (Riley Thomas Stewart).  Logan and Beth are getting closer after working together for a while and he then  discovers that it was her brother who had the picture yet he doesn't remember anyone by that name out on tour. He sees how much of an impart that her brother's death had on her because before he left they were inseparable.  This opening up to each other  leads to them eventually getting close and falling in love which her grandmother loves but the deputy sheriff in town  is not a fan of it.  The deputy sheriff just happens to be her stalking, jealous ex who always threatens to take their son away to make sure he gets his way with things.

With a Nicholas Sparks film you could whip up a batch of movie dough and take cookie cutters and they would all come out the same.  They all seem the exact same to me, even down to the artwork!

Do you see the pattern?  The film felt the same way for me.  Even though I gave The Notebook a good grade that was because I felt it deserved it.  I will give you one thing about this film, I enjoyed... oh wait there really isn't much that I did like in this film other than some humor here and there and of course how well Logan treats Beth's son.

Overall I would give this film a D+.  Guys if your girlfriend, wife, significant other wants to watch this then man up, suck it up and deal with the time... Hell you may earn some points for doing it but don't expect a good movie.  The chemistry is lacking and this is a film that one needs lots of improvement and two may have been better if it wasn't even made.

4871541,2,B005S9EK1S,"I feel how I assume most professional critics feel when reviewing movies like The Lucky One: it's a pointless exercise. Yet, here I am. I was roped into watching this by my sister, who brought out a stack of extreme chick flicks when we were in town and insisted that my wife pick one. It was a no-win situation, but I do lament the fact that she left ""13 Going on 30"" on the table. I don't mind that one so much. Someday, sis, I will have my revenge. Considering her preference for romantic, quasi-spiritual, and unapologetically hokey flicks, the next time she's in town I'm pulling out a stack of Tarantino films and forcing her to pick one. Fair is fair.

So how was this movie? Well, I'm admittedly not the target audience for this stuff, nor do I ever plan to be, but I try to give every movie a fighting chance. As God as my witness, I did, and this movie, while looking very pretty (thus the second star) was excruciating to sit through. On the bright side, it's virtually parody-proof. It's really pretty simple:

Do you tend to enjoy Sparks-style emotional porn where the lead character is impossibly handsome, polite to a fault, good-hearted and skilled at doing things that convey sensitive soulfulness (taking care of animals, talking to kids, refurbishing old houses, gazing into the distance, etc)?

Do you tend to enjoy movies (or bad sit-coms) where the plot only exists because a temporarily brain-dead lead character didn't just say what was on his mind rather than inexplicably clamming up during an important point early in the film?

Do you tend to enjoy movies where a an adorable, mop-topped child is placed in danger near the closing credits for no other reason than to set up the male lead to perform heroic deeds, and for another character (previously a mustache-twirling jerk) to redeem himself?

Do you tend to enjoy movies that seem to have been made under strict orders from studio execs to avoid anything that could be construed as evidence that the writer, director or actors possess the slightest sense of humor?

Do you tend to enjoy movies that never make even the most rudimentary attempt to deviate from the checklist of clichs a reasonably seasoned movie fan would expect to encounter?

Do you tend to enjoy watching respected elderly actors reduced to the thankless role of ""patient, wise old soul whose sage advice isn't heeded by the young headstrong daugher/granddaughter/niece until it's nearly too late""?

If you answered ""yes"" to at least three of the six, you will probably love The Lucky One. If you did not, for the love of God only watch this if you expect something in return, if you know what I mean.

Judging by the film adaptations of his books, you have to admire the purity of Nick Sparks' approach. He gives his people what they want. Some may object to the label ""emotional porn,"" but the more I think about it the more valid it seems. Both The Lucky One and ""traditional"" porn push ideals (emotional vs sexual) that bear little similarity to real life, pandering with no pretense to temporarily filling in gaps in those aspects of a person's life. One tends to appeal to dudes, one tends to appeal to the ladies, but both serve similar functions, but one is more honest than the other.",1406246400,,3244,4.67719298245614

4871771,2,B005S9EK1S,"I usually really like these kind of movies. I don't know, it wasn't very believable. Zac Efron didn't have many lines. It was a typical format for Nicholas Sparks... even with the scary ex-husband... So, the characters were just ok for me. This movie was just O.K. nothing to watch again.",1397520000,,288,4.666666666666667

4871778,5,B005S9EK1S,"I really enjoyed this movie, the story was good and the acting was natural and good.  It makes one aware of what the young men of our country are having to endure and overcome in the arena of war.  I feel so strongly for them and wish that more could be done for their re-entry into normal society in a world so very different from what they have had to live through in combat.
The characters were so much more than the often shallow beings of hollywood.  It was such a treat to experience all the emotions and trials of the characters without them resorting to bad language.
I don't think that it is cheesy; I think that most of the characters behaved in a way that most of us would think of as normal.  The ex husband was awful but unfortunately we do know that there are men out there who think and behave like him.
Zac Efron is terrific as is Taylor Schilling and their characters have a depth that is inspiring.  The son was so true to trusting, responsive childhood and totally believable.
All in all I would recommend this movie to everyone.",1396137600,5,1048,4.326530612244898

4871891,2,B005S9EK1S,"The Lucky One is a truly predictable film...formulaic, wooden acting (or was the direction just bad?), foreseeable ending.  I sat through it because I paid to rent it, and enjoy Taylor Schilling in Orange is the New Black.  What a disappointment.  Zac Efron seems more like a robot than a human in this role.  Not even up to made for TV standards.",1395705600,,347,4.548387096774194
