8161508,2,B000LC4CDI,"I've been doing step aerobics for years.  Thought I was advanced enough to do this, I was wrong.  I can't follow 90% of the workout.",1522800000,,132,4.24
8161509,1,B000LC4CDI,I consider myself an advanced stepper with 20 + years experience and this video is beyond ridiculous!  Ms. Bento seems much more interested in showing off her dance moves as opposed to providing any type of exercise instruction.  I have never had an issue following any type of video or class before however this is truly a nightmare.  Save yourself time and money and order any other (and I mean ANY other) step video by any other instructor and you'll be glad you did.,1373241600,,470,4.571428571428571
8161510,4,B000LC4CDI,"Warning that when the title of this video says ""advanced"", it's not kidding!  I used to dance for 8 years and am an experienced ""stepper"" and can always go into a workout class at the gym and pick up new steps very easily and quickly... but even I found this workout a bit frustrating on the first pass.  There is no breakdown of the steps at all in the workout; she just jumps right in.  And the steps are really challenging... and most are not steps I have done before in other step workouts.  There is a ""Preview"" section on the menu of the DVD which explains only four of the steps from the workout but even that does not go slowly or repeat enough times.

I have several step and other workout videos and I have often thought that I would like the instructor to just jump into the steps because I have done the video MANY times and don't need the steps explained EVERY time (unlike a live class which changes every time).  So I have a feeling that what was frustrating to me about the workout at first (no breakdown of very difficult steps) will end up being what I love about this DVD!",1341878400,2,1091,4.246376811594203
8161511,1,B000LC4CDI,"I'm VERY dissapointed with the quality of the DVD.  If you ask me, it's a COPY and not an original.
I'm using this on a LED TV and the quality/clarity is extremely poor.",1319414400,2,169,4.121212121212121
8161512,5,B000LC4CDI,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this step DVD! (This is a dvd for intermediate to advanced steppers only! If you are a beginner, you should opt for a different dvd). I used to do step classes at the gym quite often, but then I slacked for a couple of years. And now that I wanted to get back into stepping, I prefer to do it at home. So, I bought a step on amazon and this DVD. You will need to watch the preview section of the dvd and it will take some practice, but once you get it, you will never get bored!!! There are 4 fun combos with great moves! I have actually only mastered combos 1 and 2 so far and I still have two new ones to learn! You can see why you will not get bored with this dvd. Doing only two of the combos is a hard enough workout. When you are first learning the dvd, just use the step without the risers, then as you start to master the steps you can add risers to make it even more challenging. I definitely recommend this dvd! So much fun and a great workout for burning lots of calories!",1307664000,,1000,3.9310344827586206
8161513,1,B000LC4CDI,"I have been doing step for 20 years and I couldn't follow this DVD.  The steps are not broken down first to ease you into the combos.  It looks like once you get it, it will be a good dvd, just can't get that far.  I prefer the dvd's by Gin Miller.  The steps are broken down first but not to the point where you get bored.  Too bad...I was looking forward to this one.",1297728000,3,369,3.8666666666666667
8161514,5,B000LC4CDI,"I have been in love with step aerobics since I was 12 years old and even started teaching step in my late teens and early twenties at my church and local gym. When I got married 2 years ago I stopped working out as much and recently noticed how out of shape I've gotten. I started looking for a new step workout to kick my butt and I was soooo happy to find Amy Bento! After reading all the reviews I decided to purchase this DVD. Let me tell you...this is serious high energy, pure FUN sweat session!!! I watched the whole workout a few times (I would tell anyone to watch it a few times and if you aren't used to stepping, please try it without a step at first to get used to how fast she goes through the moves) and this morning tried it for the first time (ordered the DVD on Wednesday of last week and it came in the mail on Saturday...thanks Amazon!) and I was out of breath at the end of the first combination! But I picked up the moves easily and kept going even though I hardly could breath!!!! I am looking forward to doing it again in the morning and after I master this workout going to purchase her next one! Love love love!",1282608000,5,1137,4.103139013452915
8161515,5,B000LC4CDI,"This workout is only for people who are at an intermediate or advanced level.  It is an awesome workout.  The music is great and the moves are fun.  She goes quick when learning the new routines, so you have to rewind and keep trying until you get it.  I would suggest watching your heart rate through the workout and make sure it does not get too high.  I noticed that would happen to me and I would just need to take out the arm movements or do an alternative movement that is lower impact. The more I do this workout, I am able to keep up more and more.  I would say this for all of her high impact workouts.",1234483200,4,611,4.05
8161516,4,B000LC4CDI,"This DVD is in my regular rotation.  My favorite thing about it is that it's quicker than my others but it's super intense- I sweat as much if not more than some of my other favorite DVD's that are longer.  If I don't have much time for my workout but still want to sweat, I do this one.

I do love her moves.  They are very advanced and unique.  The time goes by pretty quickly.

I'm not a huge fan of how she breaks things down, though.  If you've seen the DVD a million times it can get tedious.  I have other DVD's that breakdown the routine with the same number of counts as the final combo so that once you know the routine you can just move forward during the breakdown.

Also- it seemed to take me an insane amount of time to catch onto her moves.  It was the first DVD I purchased after not doing any step for a couple of years- so that may be the reason.  But since then I've bought a number of advanced DVD's and have not had nearly as much trouble getting the moves down as this one.

Overall this DVD is one of my favorites.  If you're an advanced stepper it's worth getting.  Her moves are fresh and the time will fly by.  If you have trouble in the beginning just keep at it.",1210636800,6,1190,4.047210300429184
