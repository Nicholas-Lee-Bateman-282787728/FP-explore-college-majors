7902580,5,B000003K7D,I love the character Quark. He always ends up somehow turning into a nice guy. Even for a Ferengi!  The comedy and drama was excellent in this one. If you enjoy Quark and Rom his brother - you'll love this episode!,1167523200,,214,4.219512195121951
7902581,3,B000003K7D,"Episode title: The House of Quark
Written by: Ronald D. Moore (teleplay) & Tom Benko (story)
Directed by: Les Landau
""The House of Quark"" is the first reqular episode shown after the third season two-hour premiere ""The Search"", and is probably meant to give the wievers a break after a political episode wich changed the direction of the whole show, while reflecting on the consequences of the major changes onboard the station that occured during ""The Search"".
The story begins ridiculously. One night at ""Quarks"", a drunken Klingon trips over his knife and just happenes to die in the progress. After that, Quark gets an idea out of nowhere: he decides to tell everyone that he killed the Klingon, so that he can increase sales as customers line up to hear the miraculous story.
As a result Quark gets drawn into the complicated schemes of two powerfull Klingon houses, by being forced to marry the wife of the Klingon he claims to have killed.
The story is ridiculous from beginning 'till the end, but is well constructed, and offers good scenes, sharp dialoque, and introduces an ordinary, but well-placed sub plot about Miles and Keiko O'Brien's marrital relationship after all families decert the station under the Dominion threat that has risen.
Nothing special, but definitely worth a watch.",1007683200,2,1299,4.963302752293578
7902582,2,B000003K7D,"Most Trek episodes featuring the buffoonish Ferengi are comedy.  Or the greedy, cowardly, conniving, sexist little trolls serve as foils for the nobler, more enlightened Humans and other Federation species.  ""House of Quark"" establishes a disturbing view of a species apparently even more misogynist than the Ferengi.  Ironically, that species is one wildly popular with the series' female fans: the Klingons.  Admittedly, Klingon women's role in Trek had already degenerated, from the powerful warrioresses who could command ships in battle and rule the Empire, to little more than lusty, cleavage-baring dominatrixes.  But as revealed in ""House of Quark"", the Klingon wife is basically a chattel.  She cannot head a House, inherit property, or even fight her own duel for Honor.  A widow may be forced to marry her husband's murderer to retain her position as mistress of his House.  This is the basis for the episode's ""cute"" plot device -- Quark has to marry a Klingon!  There is obviously no love between Grilka and her useless mate Kozak.  But when the drunken petaQ falls on his own knife in Quark's Bar, his hapless widow must coerce Quark to champion her.  The resulting comical situations don't disguise the unsettling revelation that a Klingon female has fewer rights on her own Homeworld than does a Ferengi male!  Considering the Klingon opinion that Ferengi occupy the lowest rung on the Galactic ""food chain"", this is unpalatable fare indeed!  Luckily for the damsel in distress, Quark is more chivalrous than the average Ferengi, and clever enough to convince the Council to grant Grilka ""special dispensation"".  Although overall ""The House of Quark"" is entertaining, I consider it a poorly-conceived, disappointing episode.  It institutes the canonic disempowerment of the Klingon woman, which will progress throughout the DS9 series and continue in Voyager.",992822400,3,1875,5.287162162162162
7902583,5,B000003K7D,"I thought this was an excellent episode, one of the better episodes of Deep Space Nine. Quark accidently kills a drunk klingon, and as a result the Klingon's wife comes looking for revenge, and kidnaps Quark, and takes  him back to the Klingon Homeworld. Where the widowed klingon has to fight  for her family's honor, and Quark after marrying her helps, by looking at  the finances of the house, and helps her keep the family's honor.",962236800,4,435,4.697368421052632
