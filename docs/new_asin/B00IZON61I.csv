8646877,5,B00IZON61I,"A hidden history lurks beneath Cincinnatis streets.

A 2.2 mile tunnel that was supposed to serve as the Queen Citys subway. Conceived at the dawn the century, it was never realized as politics, corruption (but I repeat myself), economics and the innovation of the 20th century came to bear upon it. Eventually, it was abandoned. What had been built was buried, shuttered, locked up and re-purposed.

But on the remains of that 19th century wonder  the Erie Canal  parts of the subway still exist. Little locked doors around the downtown area serve as memorials. Unfortunately, they are access points not for commuters but for city workers using the space for purposes less grand and more mundane than shuttling commuters to work and home.

This is a well done documentary that tells the story of Cincinnatis abandoned subway. It will appeal to more than Cincinnatians, however. Its about more than the Queen City. Its about an era that became the American Century.

The interview subjects chosen for this film were great. Each was very informative, enthusiastic and entertaining. They were good storytellers.

My suggestion: grab a map of downtown and the greater Cincinnati area while watching so you can follow along with the locations. And then go see the locations for yourself.",1417996800,5,1283,5.052132701421801
