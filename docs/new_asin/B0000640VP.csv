1697657,4,B0000640VP,An amazine lyrical ride through the life of a true artist/poet. This movie pulls together all the vices of a man whos comand of language was that of a street poet but pulled at such reality and emotion that his world became a vision in the mind. Bratt's emotional conection to the part made it seem like he was Pinero himself. I was so moved by the movie I bought all of Pinero's books.,1042502400,2,386,4.22972972972973
1697658,3,B0000640VP,"Benjamin Bratt stars as Miguel Pinero, a Nuyorican poet-playwright and habitual criminal who is credited as a seminal influence on East Coast hip-hop and boriqueno salsa culture.  The acting throughout is excellent, but the episodic, disconnected narrative and style-heavy editing ultimately undercut the film.  It's not simply that the presentation is nonlinear; rather, it's that the film is ineffective at explaining Pinero's relationships to his friends, lovers and his art, all of which are hazily outlined, and difficult to care about.  The poet's triumphs and failings abruptly emerge then melt away, as the director and editor try to infuse their film with the same intensity and explosive, rhythmic charisma as its subject.  They also seem to assume a high level of audience familiarity with the Pinero's work, and thus fail to frame him as effectively as similar artist bioflicks such as ""Basquiat"" and ""Before Night Falls,"" which more clearly defined their subjects.  This probably is a brilliant film, but I found myself irritated that I had to work so hard to maintain my interest, and while I found the performances magnetic and absorbing, many other aspects were irritating and pretentious.",1039564800,4,1205,5.321052631578947

1697660,5,B0000640VP,"Leon Ichaso has directed an artistic masterpiece.  The music track is downright fantastic. Aesthetically, this film deserves not to be ignored.  Americans of Puerto Rican descent, though, should be enraged at ""Pinero."" Is a convicted criminal who terrified and abused his victims an ideal representative of this ethnic group's artistic heritage?  ""Pinero"" prompts one to recall Tom Wolfe's brilliant 1970 essay ""Radical Chic and Mau-mauing the Flak Catchers.""  The author held up to ridicule those wealthy guilt tripped Liberals who encouraged the Black Panthers to make fools of them.  The late poet-actor was a foul mouthed thug with enormous talent that mostly went to waste.  Needless to add, the white Liberal establishment loved enduring his abuse and adolescent behavior.
Pinero's inability to exercise self control over his unruly appetites rendered him incapable of honoring commitments and developing healthy relationships.  Benjamin Bratt's Academy Award worthy interpretation shows us a Pinero who mastered the art of victim politics.  He did not look upon the United States as a beacon of hope and opportunity.  Pinero instead perceived this great nation as an emasculator of his manhood and creative juices; an authentic Puerto Rican supposedly cannot be a real American. Fine performances are given by many members of the cast.  Talisa Soto is perfect as the woman who cannot abandon Pinero even when it becomes obvious that he is a lost cause.  The role of Miguel Pinero's mother is wonderfully carried out by veteran actress Rita Moreno.  Mandy Pantinkin and Giancarlo Esposito also deserve honorable mention.  This movie is a must see for those desiring to further understand the nihilistic American artists of the later half of the twentieth Century.  ""Pinero"" may not be for everybody, but it easily earns five stars.",1039132800,2,1837,5.333333333333333

1697663,4,B0000640VP,"There is so much to like about this film PINERO that once the movie is over you sit staring at the screen or the TV wondering why you just don't care.  The main character Miguel Pinero was a gifted artist and a pungent voice for independent thinking.  The portrayal by Benjamin Bratt is first class acting, surely some of the finest work this underrated actor has done.  The supporting cast is excellent. The cinematic effects are bewitching to behold.  Why doesn't it work?  I think part of the problem is the quality of sound, the levels of speaking often buried in noise so that straining to follow the dialogue becomes annoying.  The sexual innuendoes in the flashbacks of Pinero's youth are well handled, but then comes the major ommission of Pinero's bisexuality.  Yes, few Hollywood actors or writers want to deal with gay issues with doumentary topics.  But part of Pinero's magic was his own balancing of his attraction to young teenage men as well as to women.  It enriched his poetry, his plays, his presence.  Why leave that out of a filmed biography?  This could have been an absolutely gripping film that contained the courage of Pinero.  But alas, homophobia wins out again.",1027900800,13,1189,4.7745098039215685
1697664,1,B0000640VP,"I am a fan of Benjamin Bratt, having admired his work in ""Law and Order"" as well as in his other movies, particularly the tv movie, ""After the Storm.""  Even when the movies in which he appears are not the greatest, his performance is usually solid and entertaining.  Having said this, I rented this movie based largely on earlier reviews of Pinero, most of which touted his performance as a great departure from his clean cut good guy image, and for showing his wide range of acting skills.  I was disappointed in the movie itself, finding it disjointed, and finding the title character's life to be less than savory or sympathetic.  I wasn't expecting to identify with the title character, but would have liked to have either admired him, his talent, or to have understood him better.  None of these options was possible via this movie.  I also felt that Mr. Bratt's attempt to show his range, tended toward over acting.  Sometimes, less really is more.  I had to laugh as the always sensational, and understated, Rita Moreno steals every scene of the movie in which she appeared.  Unfortunately, stealing this movie doesn't seem to be much of a prize.  Unless you're a true fan of Miguel Pinero (I'm not), I would not recommend this movie.",1027900800,2,1241,4.703703703703703

Many gave him those breaks, which ironically just sped his path to a well-deserved oblivion, 1 this film should emulate. In fact, in the 10 or 15 minutes you've read reading this essay you probably know 10 times as much about Piero- man & film- than the film says. While Leon Ichaso deserves a panning for his take with the film, in truth, the only vaguely interesting things about the real MP was his bad art & why it caught on (briefly & limitedly) & then disappeared- as a man he was a cipher, thus the film's worship of `art' over humanity, not to mention its ridiculous conflation of import on MP by counterpointing the protagonist against documentary footage of celebrities like Muhammad Ali, Richard Nixon, Ayatollah Khomeini, & John Lennon). LI, however, failed to realize there was nothing to the art, to boot. Let me end this piece be reiterating that biopics need not be slavish to every dull detail of a person's life, but it cannot wantonly distort a person's life out of proportion with its reality. So, it's time someone finally told the truth about Piero & the Nuyoricans.",1221436800,2,1228,4.5610859728506785
1697710,1,B0000640VP,"First, let me say that Benjamin Bratt was great, despite the fact the script didn't give him much to work with. The rest of the cast, also very good.

But I wish the filmmakers had more courage.

I knew absolutely nothing about Miguel Pinero walking into this movie. But I'll say this for the film; it made me want to learn more about him. Unfortunately, it didn't really give me much information.

The filmmakers seem to have a genuine reverence for this poet/playwright, but seem petrified of exploring any of the negative aspects of his life in any kind of depth, in case that might take some of the shine off their reverence.

For example, the movie strongly hints he was bisexual. OK, so? If he was bisexual, what kind of struggle did that lead to in his relationships, or even more interesting, in himself? The movie never even begins to address these questions.

It also portrays Pinero as the victim of child abuse. Pretty powerful stuff, no? We see disturbing images from his youth. But they are never really followed up on. They are just there, as if to say, ""hey, that must have been pretty bad.""

The movie suggests that most of this talented man's relationships were quite complicated. But we never really get a demonstration of that. Only vague innuendoes that are occasionally thrown out with little reference.

The real Miguel Pinero sounds like he was a talented, complicated and very interesting man. One who deserves a better treatment of his life's story.",1176249600,3,1475,4.73828125
1697731,2,B0000640VP,"The work and art of Pinero inspired me - not this film. The confusing, and utterly diabolical frame shifts from black and white to grain to color to just about any other amateur film technique reminded me of my experience during ""The Blair Witch Project"". Using nonadhesive storytelling with a jumbled voice to the camera, one watching this may not make it to the end. I did, mainly due to the captivating work of one Benjamin Bratt - but I cannot give this film much more credit.

Let me state: Pinero is a genius. He work will be forever remembered. I just could not pull myself together for this film. I think over the past five years, or at least since the release of this film, the biographical film has grown to be a stronger production. Actors are willing awards for their work (i.e. Jamie Foxx and Eddie Murphy), and this film allowed Bratt to be better than I could have imagined, but it was the surroundings of this film that made me take a step back. To begin, the story was troubling. Pinero's life was not light, or one that will make children smile, but it did have its moments to shine. Director Leon Ichaso, I believe, understood Pinero's chaotic life, thus created a film with themes of the same chaos. The issue then becomes that it didn't translate well onto the screen. In one instance, we were captivated by Pinero's life behind bars, the next moment he is winning awards, then we are pushed back into his jail time. There was no consistency. We would have moments when we went from his accomplishments to his troubled times that happened in the past, to something in the future. This could have been a strong accomplishment to help accompany the work of Pinero, but instead what occurred was a jumbled mess of cinematic value in which our characters outside of Bratt become merely nameless shadows. Also, his poetry (due to the lacking cohesiveness) becomes less poignant. We see very little of his play ""Short Eyes"" and really how he drew his inspiration for this award winning work. Ichaso tried to be original with his direction, but it withdrew from Pinero, ultimately turning those casual viewers away from watching the life of a great poet.

As you watch this film, keep you eye on Bratt's honest moments. There are times that he fades in and out of Pinero, but he gives over 100% dedication to what Pinero represented. His performance is one that should have put him on a fast-track to being the next Brad Pitt, but I think what ultimately hurt his opportunity was the fuzzy direction and inconsistent camera (as discussed) of this film. He is the only character in this film. Ichaso attempts to bring the people from Pinero's life to screen, but since we jump sporadically throughout the hour and a half, we never quite know who these important assets were. The friend in the van, for example, I thought was a performer in the play. Who really was the man that he lived with? These questions could have been easily answered through dialog or perhaps an informative introduction, but instead Ichaso cut corners and just gave us names throughout the film. A possible strong opportunity again lost due to over-creativity. What really happened to Pinero and Sugar? That was a deep relationship that needed a further element - she was his muse...correct? With a straight forward bio-pic I shouldn't be asking these questions. Again, Pinero was phenomenal with his words, which wasn't accentuated enough. Ichaso could have taken lessons from a small film like ""Lenny"" which was able to use Bruce's words and story of his life cohesively.

The greatest element, for me, of this film was the ending. The poem about spreading his ashes through the Lower East Side made me want to read more of his poetry. It was such a powerful, yet flawed scene. I needed - wanted - to know more about the poets that were reading his work. Nonetheless, it was breathtaking. It showed the power of his words, and just a taste of how his influences now resonate throughout the hip-hop music genre. I was disappointed with this disc, because if offers nothing to really see the real Pinero. I was hoping for a bit of a ""real life"" biography, but nothing of the sort happened outside of Bratt speaking about how great this man was - which is not true. Pinero, as stated before, is a genius, but not a great man. His work was sometimes underscored by his addiction - imagine if he wasn't influenced by drugs ... hum ... would his work be as good?

Overall, I think this could have been a great film. I have no problems with independent cinema - or - about biographical films, but when you push too hard on one side, you sometimes loose the central focus. This was the case with ""Pinero"". Ichaso focused so heavily on making a cutting edge film that a good chunk of the story got muddled through the trenches. I wanted to know about Pinero, the struggling artist, not a confusing epileptic episode that was the final product. The characters got muddled in this mess, Bratt was the shining star, but that can be the only positive reaction one could have. The ending eerily reminded me of Depp's ""Blow"", but that could be a whole new conversation. I saw the angle that Ichaso was going, I just don't think the final product was put together very well. It seemed rushed and completely absurd at times.

1697734,5,B0000640VP,"Benjamin Bratt delivers an outstanding performance as poet/playwright Miguel Pinero. His accurate and believable portrayal of the ""Nuyorican"" deserves much more acclaim than the little attention it received when the movie was first released. While being a Nuyorican myself allows me to engage in the character's world and plight perhaps more than those outside of the community, the internal struggle Pinero faces daily should resonate with anyone who has dealt with less than perfect circumstances. The movie is raw and strikes at the core of what makes an artist both successful and doomed- the ability to allow himself to feel and articulate life's beauty, hypocrisy, and irony all in one breath, paint stroke, song, dance, etc.",1105920000,2,731,5.310344827586207
1697735,3,B0000640VP,"I wish I liked 'Pinero' more than I do.  I have a lot of respect for Ben Bratt and think he turns in a yeoman's effort here an Boriqueno poet Miguel Pinero.  It's a complete transformation.  Pinero's seedy, disheveled persona is a far cry from Bratt's polished, slicked-back 'Law and Order' look.  And who doesn't root for Talisa Soto (Bratt's wife)?  What a classy lady.

The problem is that the jumpy, non-linear, confusing look and storyline of Pinero make it hard to generate any warmth towards the film itself or the characters.  Which is a shame, because Director Leon Ichaso is someone I'd like to recommend.  His 1996 release 'Azucar Amarga' (Bitter Sugar) about one man's disillusionment with Castro's Cuba is a singular accomplishment and a transcendant movie-going experience.  Despite my disappointment at the way 'Pinero' turned out, I'd still urge you to check 'Bitter Sugar' as soon as you possible can.",1093305600,,918,4.9868421052631575
1697736,5,B0000640VP,"Pinero is based on the life of puertorican playwright, actor and poet Miguel Pinero. His life from early childhood was a constant struggle for survival since his father abandoned his mother (played by the great Rita Moreno)when he was a small boy. Pinero turned to a life of crime while still in his early teens and served time in Sing-Sing for arm robbery and stealing cars. While on the inside Pinero turned his anger and frustrations to writing short stories which later became plays such as his most successful and controversial play ""SHORT EYES"" which was nominated for a Tony Award as Best Play in the late 70's. Pinero also started a theater group in jail and perform for the other inmates plays that he had written. Joseph Papp, the legendary theater producer read Pinero's play ""SHORT EYES"" and decided to produced it Off Broadway while it became a success despite is limted run.
I have never been fond of Benjamin Bratt as an actor but in this movie he did an excellent job and really transformed himself into the character. This movie is a bit strong and somewhat harsh since it depicts the reality of the character. Miguel Pinero was not only a convict but a drug addict who took heavy doses of cocaine and would inject large quantaties of heroin on his arms. Pinero lived the life of a bum through out his life and even as he reached moderate success as a playwright he still hard a tough time fighting his inner demons. He died in 1988 at the age of 40 of Aids (I believe) after he overdosed on more heroin.
This movie is not for everyone but it is a good movie whose main character lived a very sad and tragic life and just as he lived life on the edge he ended his run on earth the same way.",1078876800,9,1707,4.4222222222222225
1697737,5,B0000640VP,"After his father abandons his family, Miguel Piero starts a journey that will take him through the lowest and highest points imaginable. Miguel was prayed upon by perverted adults in his childhood, became a drug addict, and ended committing a series of crimes and going to prison (prisoner 150614). During his stay in Sing Sing a visit by his mother urging him to make her proud motivates him to start writing a play about life in prison called Short Eyes, which will be his first step towards stardom.
Life after prison did not change much, he was successful as a poet and writer, but his personality made him return to his bad habits. His belief was that a painful and troubling life results in devotion to the truth, and therefore allowed him to write in such an exceptional way.
The movie shows the particular relationship Piero had with some of his friends, two of which appear as particularly prominent, Miguel Algarin and Tito Goya; the former a professor at Rutgers, the latter a partner in crime and drugs. This also shows the duality that was present in other aspects of his life. There are several other manifestations on this duality throughout the movie, for example Miguel had a ""stable"" relationship with Sugar, his girlfriend, but he also had amorous relationships with other men.
The style in which the movie is presented corresponds well with the inner turmoil Piero experienced. There is an interesting use of alternation between black and white and color scenes and the action keeps moving forward and backward in time without any clear array.
The performance given by Benjamin Bratt is extraordinary. I do not like this actor particularly, but in this case I have to acknowledge he fitted the role perfectly. He also performed extremely well in the parts in which it is required from him to recite poems.
This is an amazing movie and I think everyone should see it. Nevertheless, if you are uncomfortable with non-linear sequence in the action, or are not interested in the least in poetry, it would be better for you to skip it.

The performances in the film are really special.

And I was particularly moved by Rita Moreno's portrayal of Pinero's mother; one scene between her and Bratt is particularly heartwrenching.
The film covers many important aspects of Pinero's life: his time in jail, the opening of his landmark play ""Short Eyes,"" his Puerto Rican/""Nuyorican"" identity, and more. Ichaso paints his canvas with some powerful and disturbing visuals.

Buen hecho!,1451433600,,328,4.672413793103448

7960133,5,B0000640VP,Brilliant! Benjamin Bratt should have won an Oscar and so should have been the great and very underrated director Leon Ichaso. And the music is incredible. Kudos to the music people on this. A wonderful portrait of a fascinating and complicated man. I highly recommend it.,1440633600,,272,4.934782608695652
