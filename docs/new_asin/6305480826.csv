7889916,5,6305480826,"This is an exceptional, unbiased video; and the best I have seen to date regarding an accurate account of this important discovery.  This video uses many of Dr. John C. Trever's photos, including virtually all of his standard slide presentation (80 slides).  This is one of the few Videos that gives the credit due Dr. Trever in his role of identifying and photographing the first Dead Sea Scrolls brought to light.  Indeed, his photos are the most complete and accurate of the original condition of the great Isaiah scroll, Manual of Discipline (Rule of the Community), and the Habbakuk Commentary.  Today these scrolls have deteriorated to black and require infra-red photography to see virtually any of the text.  If you want an honest recount of the Dead Sea Scroll discovery, this is it!! PS: There is one error made by the narrator regarding the comparison of the Masoretic Greek Old Testament text with the Dead Sea Scrolls, where she says: ""... there are no differences..."".  She should have said ""few, and only minor differences"".",995846400,5,1039,4.942528735632184
