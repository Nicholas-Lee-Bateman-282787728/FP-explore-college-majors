7948139,1,B00005O0SY,"Ok story if that's what you are looking for. Filming was terrible like with a video camera (intentional).
If you're looking for erotica or graphic sex, there is none. If you see it for a buck used buy it otherwise no.",1350345600,,217,4.317073170731708
7948140,1,B00005O0SY,The transfer is very bad. The quality of the movie is very poor. Scenes end very abruptly & skip to the next scene. Scenes jump seconds ahead. Many scenes are edited right in the middle of the scene. The acting is very poor & the plot unbelievable.,1312502400,2,248,4.297872340425532
7948141,1,B00005O0SY,"This was the biggest waste of time.  it was incredibly boring, nothing happens.  Well actually the only thing that happens is a bunch of cracked out cracked heads take a lot of bathes after shooting up.  Some of you guys are thinking hmm that sounds interesting and it would have been had all the prostitutes not looked like homeless people.  They all look horrible, why would I want to see that dressed, let alone naked.  Anyway the main character managed to afford fake boobs and botox cause the few times she does try to smile in the movie her face doesn't move her face and body looks grotesque. Besides all that NOTHING HAPPENS!!! It is ridiculous. Oh and then her mom has sex with her  haha and she doesn't care, but why would she, she is always cracked out.  I think I would get more entertainment watching a REAL Documentary on crack-heads",1306713600,2,847,4.532894736842105
7948142,5,B00005O0SY,"First and foremost I should say.  If you do not like unedited, raw movies about life with none of the false softening up of stories, then this may not be for you.

Although this movie is low budget, I think it's up there with Kids and City of God in terms of showing the tough to see realities of this world.  Fiona is a story a nyc prostitute.  It's shown in a way that almost feels like a documentary.  Since it's a low-budget film, you can almost feel as if you were standing in the room watching as the story unfolds.  There are no specialized soundtracks or covering up of creaks on the floor boards.  You get it all, un-edited.

For those interested in watching a free preview, the nyc public library website has it available (I don't know of any other place that has a preview for it):

7948143,5,B00005O0SY,"This film is about as gutwrenchingly real and gritty as you can get. This is NOT Pretty Woman, this is what the life of a prostitute is really like, no glamor, no fluff, no Richard Gere. Fiona's story, and those of her friends and her mother, is the story of too many women and children in our society, and unless you have no soul, this is very hard viewing. I watched this movie on late night television yesterday and the reviewer gave it one star. Well, I guess some people can't relate to the truth...
The ""actors"" in this film appear to be ""real"" people from the streets. Their honesty in portraying what their world is like can only be commended.  Kudos to each and every one of them and to the director as well for having the guts to do this film.  The movie has a documentary feel, in the sense that you can hear the camera whirring in the background, there is no dramatic sound track, no fake moaning when one of the prostitutes has to perform a sexual act. The danger and the disempowerment these women must deal with, their heartbreaking search for love, and the disillusionment and sense of hopelessness they face are all powerfully portrayed, as is their underlying rage. So, why, you may ask, would you want to watch such a depressing movie?  Because maybe it will give you a little more insight, a little more compassion, and perhaps help you to understand that fellow human being you walk past on the street.  I especially recommend this film to men who frequent prostitutes...if you think they're having fun or that they are not ""a person"", think again...
I highly recommend this movie for the brave of heart.",1066435200,21,1625,4.535836177474403
7948144,5,B00005O0SY,"if you want to see a semi softcore porn involving Fiona- who was abandoned by her prostitute mother, only to be mollested throughout her childhood in foster care, and eventualy becomes a crack smoking, heroine shooting, sometimes lesbian, prostitute, (who eventualy almost has sex with her mother when they unknowingly reunite the day before she jumps off a building later in life..) its a movie for you. it was actualy VERY true to real life. I don't think most of the people were actors, it looks like they got them off the street. very realistic film. just..... wierd. but a good wierd! oh yeah-its also like as low budget as they come. but that also makes it unique.",1013212800,15,670,4.686440677966102
