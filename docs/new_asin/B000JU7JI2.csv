8153030,4,B000JU7JI2,"LOVE CAN BE MURDER - DIRECT SOURCE/FREEMANTLE MEDIA DVD --- As an avid film / movie watcher I was pleasantly surprised to run across this fun comedic romp from the 90's. --- When the movie first started I thought it wouldn't live up to the great reviews it had received here on Amazon. -- While not deep nor esoteric this movie very quickly turned into a well done little light hearted 90's comedy.--- The more it progressed the better it got and the more it lostmore and more of its 90's cheese factor. --- The writer and director kept a great pace and magnetic factor going for the whole movie. The plot and character interactions were great and created an endearing attraction to those characters. --- It's a light hearted murder mystery romance between the leads Corbin Bernsen playing a well dressed (in period) ghost come back from the late 40's and attorney turned Private eye Jaclyn Smith. --- Nice to see Anne Baxter as well who I remember watching in the 60's tv series Honey West where she starred as one of the earliest Female Private eyes. --- In addition the background music is excellent,with a perfect volume level and perfectly selected by the music director. ---This movie is extremely rare and hard to find but like ""Maxie"" worth the effort when you do. --- I give it 4 stars as ""10's"" (5 stars) should be reserved for truly exceptional films/movies only.--- Highly recommended light fun that will put a smile on your face and keep it there for an hour and a half. --- Hope this info helps u out.",1526515200,,1515,4.573529411764706

8153039,5,B000JU7JI2,"The combination of Corbin Benson & Jaclyn Smith was a phenomenal surprise to me since both of these stars are more well-known for dramantic roles in other television or/and film projects. This movie has a little bit of everything (to some degree) for anyone who loves the mystery/crime genre from the 1940's. With a little dash of comedy, action, romance & ""reincaration"" aspects thrown in, this is a fun picture. To some folks this movie might seem a bit ""corny"" and somewhat predictable in some repects. But the wonderful Los Angeles locales and additional great performances by Cliff DeYoung and Ann Francis made this movie worth watching and having in their personal collection.",1179619200,11,682,5.04424778761062
