The animation is very reminiscent of the 1980's filmation style, so if you grew up with that sort of thing it should be okay.  The acting isn't great, and the animation is done on the cheap, but it is well worth the watch for any Phantom ""phan."" On a side note, you don't have to buy it on VHS anymore you can pick it up in this collection on DVD here:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Greatest-Tales-Ever-Told/dp/B003CS28VQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Greatest Tales Ever Told</a>",1347753600,,578,5.72093023255814

I grant that it's cute and I did find parts (such as Raoul's masquerade costume) hilarious. Much of the memorable points from the book/musical are lost. Such as: The Graveyard, the little croaking incident, Carlotta herself, Mme Giry, etc. I also found the phantom more cutsy-wootsy than phantomy. He doesn't wear black, he wears blue and pink. The mask has almost a smiley face look to it. When they try to use quotes they slash them to bits, and Erik kills a cat, which I find highly unlikely. The animation is also low quality. They have this thing about zooming in on people's eyes. They acting is also rather weak. However it is always fun to sit with phriends and laugh at this attempt while correcting it's innumerable errors.",995241600,4,869,4.686274509803922
7878342,5,6304847408,"It's hard to believe! But this animated version of Leroux's masterpiece is a lot closer to the novel than any other production I have seen! The intervals of suspense, comic relief, terror, and pure sorrow are well balanced. Raoul and Christina remain faithful to Leroux's creation. The mysterious Persian is memorable as the back stage player who eventually emerges as the man who actually knows the phantom, and  has crucial knowledge that can save Christina. Erick is phenomenal; first we only see him in the shadows; then we hear him talking to Christina (behind a closed door). Later he unleashes his terror and abducts her. The terror continues when he cuts the chandelier during the opera. Later, the Persian reveals more frightening things about the phantom. Christina's choice of the Scorpion and the Grasshopper is suspenseful. Finally, Erick shows his human side, and our fear and suspense turn to deep sorrow. His death is just as lamentable here as it was in the book. Do NOT gloss over this because it is animated! It is true and loyal to the genious of Leroux. I can only think of 16 movies that I would call exquisite masterpieces, and this is one of them. If  a movie accomplishes the intentions of it's author (especially one like Leroux), it can be a masterpiece even if it is animated.",974764800,17,1304,4.791111111111111
