6208156,5,B00HT29OXQ,"The high standard of first rate gay themed dramas coming our way these days deserves to be lauded.  The Hungarian film ""Land of Storms"" is another fine example of a film that can be enjoyed and appreciated on many levels and provides very satisfying fare for the discerning viewer. I hesitated with my * rating as in my opinion falls between **** and ***** but I'm going for the higher as I think this film deserves a wide audience.
Promising footballer Szabolcs gives his German team the flick after disagreements and returns to the Hungarian countryside for solitude and the task of rebuilding an old farmhouse he inherited from his grandfather.  Very much a loner until he encounters a local lad Aron who helps him with the rebuilding, only to find their attraction to each other transcends into a sexual relationship.  Aron is torn between caring for his disapproving sick mother and the homophobic abuse from the village boys with his ever reliant love and desire for Szabolcs.  Matters become even more complicated when old soccer buddy Bernard arrives in town to reignite his love for Szabolcs, creating a very difficult triangle for the boys.
Complex characters in generally inhospitable surroundings are portrayed in a wonderfully realistic style by an excellent cast.  An absorbing story, excellently directed by Adam Csaszi from a fine script by the director and Ivan Szabo.  All technical credits are top notch, making this film an excellent, thoughtful drama.",1427760000,39,1472,5.037037037037037
6208157,5,B00HT29OXQ,"I have a feeling the reviews will be all over the place on this one. At the risk of being a spoiler, it's because the ending is tragic and shocking but other initial reviewers have already reveled that aspect of the film. Other than that, I found it wonderful. It's another story like ""Freefall"" or ""Brokeback"", that describes what can happen when a straight man falls in love with a gay man and how powerful love can be in spite of tremendous obstacles and consequences. I noticed another said there was lots of nudity, but not really. A shower fight scene. The erotic nature of the love scenes, however, is really intense. Hungarian with subtitles. Good picture, sound, and editing.",1427155200,29,684,4.708333333333333
6208158,5,B00HT29OXQ,This film is excellent!!! A Great plot with plenty of nudity and realism.  Great cast and drama.  I would like to see more films of this quality and realism.,1427068800,,157,4.379310344827586
6208159,3,B00HT29OXQ,the movie about a soccer player who quits team moves back to his inherited house in the country.  The house is a wreck.  He hires a handyman to help him fix it up.  They end up having feelings for each other and have some passionate moments.  The local town is very homophobic which causes emotional strain on the handyman.  The movie ending was a little bit shocking and unexpected and sad.,1426896000,6,391,4.450704225352113
6208160,3,B00HT29OXQ,"The title of this review hopefully offers insight and is not intended to be a spoiler. (I'll save that for the last line.) On the surface this is a beautiful film about how love happens, we are taught as men, on this planet, not to accept ourselves if different from other boys, men, brothers, sons, etc... I'm still working out why the writer/director created the shower fight scene as it was clearly about more than soccer skills. It's the remote community and its typical reactionary mentality, but more importantly, why Aron would tell his mother what he did and why and who she shared the information. If you are confused by all these unanswered question,not to worry...that's life. More significantly, this film has the potential to be a superb snapshot of some lives in a remote German town somewhere but it's not. It's snapshot of the lives we live everyday everywhere. and, that's what so painful about the events transpire.

SPOILER ALERT:
I want to give this film at least 4 stars but ""based on true life events or NOT,"" until we stop making us pay for being born who we are by killing us off as punishment...No, I can't and won't!",1426550400,7,1142,4.653465346534653
6208161,4,B00HT29OXQ,"This is another brilliantly done, beautiful romantic drama. It's one of those films, that stick with you. It creates in the viewer strong emotional feelings. You become a part of the story along with the characters. I think what ultimately stands out is the acting by all three. Andras Suto, Adam Varga and Sebastian Urzendowsky are truly beautiful together, and they are able to grab your attention and make you focus on the story, and most of all, each other.

The direction is superb by Adam Csazi. A well-crafted film and a thought provoking tale of relationships, love and finding oneself in a mix of having to choose, or come to terms with an outcome of emotions. This is Csazi's first full length feature film, and that shows just how amazing and talented, this director is, because this is, in reality a perfect film of drama, love and so much more.

6208163,5,B00HT29OXQ,"One of the best films I have seen! Sad to say 8 of 10 gay themed movies are crappy. Mostly I think due to lack of funds
to hire good actors and directors.
But when you find the 2 good ones out of the 10 they will blow you away!
Well written well acted I highly recommend this film.
Kudos to the actors and director!",1464134400,,315,3.8615384615384616
6208164,4,B00HT29OXQ,"There's no question that director dm Csszi's film looks stunning, and benefits from some attractive leads, but this isn't the ""hot three-way love story"" Amazon's product description promises (although a hot threeway does feature). It's primarily a film about homophobia, and homophobic violence, and (spoiler alert) it doesn't end well.

There's some discussion in the other reviews for this film about anti-gay violence and unhappy endings, much of which I agree with. All too often it feels like the easy option for filmmakers, the sudden, violent death of the protagonist. It's a tactic I'm fed up with too. No one's asking for a happy ever after ending, but does it always have to end with the bloody slaying of the gay guy? It isn't shocking, you just think, ""Gee, I didn't see that coming.""

Climax aside, ""Land of Storms"" is well worth seeing. Enjoy the trip, but don't be surprised by the dark clouds rolling in...",1451174400,2,922,4.903846153846154
6208165,3,B00HT29OXQ,"The story has the fatal ending climax.  I do not like to see so much death and sorrow in Gay Movie dramas.  The story line would have been much better with out the murder at the end, but it is a fairly good story.  I downgrade this movie cause it leaves you feeling really bummed out.",1450137600,,284,4.035714285714286

6208174,5,B00HT29OXQ,"Szabolcs (Andrs St) plays in a German football team, as does Bernard (Sebastian Urzendowsky).  A lost match and an ugly confrontation leads Szabolcs to reconsider his life.  He goes back to Hungary for simplicity & to build up an inherited broke down house and to bask in his newly found solitude.  He meets Aron, a local who welcomes him by stealing his motorcycle.  In a odd turn of events, Szabolc hires Aron (dm Varga) to help him rebuild his property.  A mutual attraction develops to the detriment of Szabolcs, as Aron's mother and local mates disapprove of their relationship.  Violence ensues for both.  A sexual friendship of the same sex attraction breeds contempt with the towns people, as Aron's dependent mother denounces her son's lifestyle to the local bullies in an attempt to ""correct"" his behavior.  A confused yet curious Aron expresses his affection for Szabolc with a mix bag of emotions and several eruptive confrontations that will ultimately lead to a very shocking and disturbing finale.

This Hungarian/German co-production may very well be reflective, and a testament of the the state of affairs and societal hostilities that still remain in place in a few rural towns within eastern Europe where the enabling, persecution & disdain for  same sex couples seems to remain latent.  This mentality shepherded by religious intolerance is what leads the violence and  the hostile living conditions for anyone not subscribed to the few who have self appointed themselves as the enforcers of the town's moral code of conduct.

Hungarian director Adam Csaczi's unveiling of the story with its sweeping cinematography, superb direction and acting  is poetic, lyrical and subtly mesmerizing.",1435104000,7,1708,5.186131386861314

6208176,4,B00HT29OXQ,"Saw it on Netflix; buying it for keeps
A first class, intra-psychic ballet --  Only four stars because I didn't understand the ending --  was it real or someone's fantasy?
Nevertheless, a deeply felt, sumptuously imagined, beautifully photographed dance among three young men in love, lust, and conflict.  The sexual connections take place mainly below the tightly focused, shoulder level cameras, but there is no coyness about the sexuality.  The plot: Szabolcs is an up and coming soccer star, but his coach is as dominating as was his obnoxious soccer-hot father back home.  Szabolcs quits, goes back home and falls in love with Aron, a young man he seems to have known before who tries to steal Sz.'s motorbike.  Sz. now becomes the dominant male, and ""steals"" the bike from Aron.  They become lovers.
The transformation of the third boy from adoring wanna-be to dominating jerk is shocking.  Who can think that love brings out the best in us?",1433203200,,947,4.911949685534591

6208181,4,B00HT29OXQ,"Two boys are talented football players in Germany Szabolcs is from Hungary and his best friend Bernard is German. Then after a particularly unfruitful game, Szabolc decides to return to Hungary and live in the broke down farm that he inherited from his grandfather.

Whilst he had rejected his homosexual urges in Germany - once he gets home he meets ron and for him it is a game changer. The thing is it is also a game changer for the whole community. To say any more may be veering in to plot spoiler territory. Needless to say there are depictions of homophobia here. Some may say that we have seen it all before, but films like this need to be made to address the still pervading attitudes in many countries and communities towards LGBT people.

Filmed in Hungarian, German and a tad of English with good sub titles. This is done using an original story line, a group of talented actors and a lot of warmth. The decisions that some of the characters make may be questionable, but I am pretty safe in saying that we all have made mistakes in our lives. I found this to be engrossing, sensual - in parts - and ultimately moving; this is for lovers of gay cinema in all its parts.",1429315200,9,1181,4.412844036697248
8635639,5,B00HT29OXQ,Great film filled with the anguish experienced by the principal characters. A film that shows the prejudice and prevailing homophobia that continues to exist throughout the world. Arn is truly tortured by his inward desires and the society which cannot accept that lifestyle. Im not convinced that the surprise ending is how someone like Arn would act when you love someone. Almost doesnt make sense. But I get it: the Land if Storms and the dsmage the storm leaves behind. Beautifully photography!  The Hungarian and German languages give the film the authenticity to how other cultures respond to homosexuality. Very deep and thought provoking!  Dont miss this one!,1532390400,,667,5.166666666666667

some amateur (armchair?) psychology relating to the ill-effects of self-hate engendered by society
If this sounds like a warning, consider, also, that this film is beautifully photographed, edited for total naturalism, superbly acted, and uber erotic.

One could call it D.H. Lawrence from a homosexual angle.
