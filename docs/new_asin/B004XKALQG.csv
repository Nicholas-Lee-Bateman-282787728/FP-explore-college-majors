8447011,5,B004XKALQG,"This 2nd DVD set was a great way to review electricity and magnetism. Having completed all his physics DVD sets, I want more. I wish he had an undergraduate quantum mechanics DVD set and an undergraduate cosmology DVD set.",1476835200,,222,4.717948717948718
8447012,3,B004XKALQG,Just okay.,1471651200,,10,4.5
8447013,5,B004XKALQG,"Jason Gibson is a genius!! I ordered all of his chemistry, his calculus and all of his physics!! So far I have just completed the chemistry and I have such a greater understanding because of this man.  He breaks everything down to such a simple easy to understand format. Please, Jason Gibson, come out with an organic chemistry tutor DVD set!!",1423008000,,344,4.639344262295082

8447015,5,B004XKALQG,it was worth to spend the time and money. It great for review after class.... I found it helpful and I do recommend it to those who have a little bit of hard time like I use to have :-),1412467200,,185,3.65
8447016,5,B004XKALQG,I have almost all his dvds and they are amazing... wish he had more engineering and physics... like statics and mechanics.....,1382486400,,126,5.0476190476190474
8447017,5,B004XKALQG,"I have used most of Jason's DVDs to prepare me for classes before I take them, fill in material from lecture that my teachers either glossed over, or did not explain very well, or get ready for tests.

To be clear, this is a tutorial DVD.  To clarify for the supposed teacher that gave this two stars because he did not process from the title of the product what it is, this is not something designed to get you interested in physics.  It is to help work through actual physics problems and learn, or brush up on the material.  It is Jason standing in front of a white board going through many examples.

This set focuses mainly on capacitors and then the magnetic field material.  The topics that you will get in the second semester of the class that he does not go through is the resistor circuit problems, inductance and optics.  That is why you cannot rely just on this to get through your class.  There is material that Jason omits that you are going to get exposed to.

Like most of the other physics DVDs Jason puts out, it is geared more toward non calculus based physics.  However he does in this video (and volume 1 of this set) use more calculus to show alternate ways to solve some of the problems and derive some of the formulas.  He does more derivation here than he has done in most of the other DVDs combined, but that is because many teachers require students to derive the formulas on quizzes and tests in calculus based physics.

Like all of Jason's DVDs if you use this correctly (as a supplement to, not a replacement for class) they will definitely help you.  Just know that some of the problems he goes through will be a little on the easy side for those taking calc based physics.  Although he does give enough variety, that regardless of what level of class you are in it will help you learn the subject.",1371513600,3,1829,4.388724035608309
8447018,2,B004XKALQG,"I had the pleasure of reading reviews of this title before buying the product. Unfortunately the reviews I read did not clarify my mind about the product and I ordered it anyway,  I was under the wrong impression that this dvd will create interest in various topics of physics among my students.  However, to my utter dismay, the video is for those students who want to learn the subject without a teacher and to me it looks like a dry presentation of a very interesting subject.  I would be useful only for those who wish to study the subject of physics at home without the help or guidance of a teacher.

8447019,5,B004XKALQG,I bought this because my daughter this summer because she is taking AP Physics C in high school this fall and wanted her to be able to get a head start prior to the course. This is great material to also assist in review.,1315180800,,221,4.045454545454546
