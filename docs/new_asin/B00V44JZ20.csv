8709040,5,B00V44JZ20,"For any Stray Cats / Brian Setzer  fan, this is a must own.  For all my fellow guitar players out there, this is some of Brian's most stunning playing. There are two complete shows here,  and the festival show is by far superior to the club show.  While the club show is great, Brian's famous 1963 Fender Bassman is absent  and he finds himself playing through a Vox AC 30, radically altering his tone. (  could have been using borrowed equipment? A back up amp? Who knows! LOL )  The casual listener may not even notice, but if you're a guitar player and Setzer freak ,  it will be readily apparent. His playing is still fierce ,  however. But the real winner here is the festival show. The band is in top form. Brian's playing and singing will just blow your mind. The set list is amazing.  Considering it was the early 80s, the audio and sound quality are both terrific. As far as the camerawork is concerned,  there's a lot of great nuggets for all of the guitar players out there. The cameraman spends a lot of time focused on Brian's hands during solos and tricky bits, so it kind of serves as a instructional video as well! Anyway, I can't say enough great things about this. Money well spent.",1505088000,,1200,4.384615384615385
