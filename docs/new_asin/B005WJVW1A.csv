I had a crush on him when he appeared on American television in Maya so this was a sentimental purchase, and I am pleased with it as such.  I don't know if this is something everyone would enjoy.",1385337600,,254,4.163265306122449

Mother India, too has been pod of her good sons - and has shed tears over her bad ones. It is the story of a boy who, from class room to court room, was never afraid of speaking the truth. It is the story of a boy who, in his search for his father, went hungry for days but never thought of stealing or begging. It is the story, not of a Paragon of Virture, but those footpath schools where the Devil himself teaches sinful trades to friendless, homeless and hungry children like Gopal. But Gopal had only his mothers teaching to lean upon. His father was one of those playboys who run into debts and, then fall into the hands of Sharks like Jang Bahadur. He married Kamla only to get rich, but in her he found such devotion and love that he was ashamed of himself. The unfortunate man left a good home, a good wife and dear little son - Gopal - and became a reculse, with eternal sorrow as his only companion. SON OF India is the story of a fearless boys faith in God. This is the story of a boys faith in a bullet and his challenge of Death. This is the story of a man who loses faith in God - and then regains it. This is the story of a woman whose love regains everything - by sacrificing all that love values most. This story is for those fathers and mothers who care for the India of Tomorrow - and for every son and daughter who is Tomorrows India.",1302134400,2,1465,4.090277777777778
