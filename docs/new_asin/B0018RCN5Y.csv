3418686,5,B0018RCN5Y,I first started watching this show with my cousin a few summers ago on Adult Swim...we'd try and figure out who could figure out the culprit first...it was fun...and now I love this show...,1223078400,6,189,4.588235294117647
3418687,5,B0018RCN5Y,"Case Closed tells of a seventeen-year-old high school student named Jimmy Kudo who is also a renowned detective.  He suddenly gets ambushed by members of the Black Organization and fed a poison that should have killed him but reverted him to an eight-year-old.  He has to now solve cases while trying get his real body back.  Wow, this is one awesome series and I love how the different motives for murders changes with each episode.  I have loved mysteries since I can remember and that is part of the reason why I love this series.  If your a fan of mysteries or just an anime fan, I highly recommend this series.",1222646400,,615,4.504504504504505
3418688,5,B0018RCN5Y,"My cousin got me into this show a while back, but it was extremely hard to find until now. it really is a well written series of mysteries and is very easy to jump into the story, unlike many other animes.

3418690,1,B0018RCN5Y,"this is going to seem a biased Review to some , and perhaps rightfully so

but I base it on the assumption that ""quality"" and ""Literal translation"" must be considered synonomous

The Subtitle on this show is a polite nod as they don't even include the option of changing the credits so you don't see the case closed logo (Maybe that was a neccessity of Including so many episodes for so low a price but I wish I'd known...)

I'd rather own the Original  and practice my jappanese with it personally

Down with Dubbing.",1218153600,3,518,4.468085106382978
3418691,5,B0018RCN5Y,"I've been waiting and waiting for this. Now I can get the DVD Season Sets.

Right now I have the Cartoon Network's [adult swim] made for TV recorded on my PC. The [adult swim] episodes run from season 1 to season 3 and season 3 is just a partial set.

3418692,5,B0018RCN5Y,"I was extremely happy when Case Closed (detective conan) came to Cartoon Network so many years ago, and so very sad when it was canceled after only 50 or so episodes.

Basically Case Closed (detective conan) is the story of Jimmy (Shinichi) Kudo, a famous high school detective and devout follower of Sherlock Holmes, that is poisoned by the mysterious ""Black Organization"" and becomes the child detective Conan Edogawa through a side effect of the experemental drug he was poisoned with. After moving in with his childhood friend and love interest (Their first date happens in Episode 1, before Jimmy gets poisoned) Rachel (Mori Ran) and her father Richard Moore (Mori Kogorou), Conan begins to solve cases, using Richard Moore as a puppet (after being knocked out by a tranquilizer dart, and using a voice changer to sound like Richard) as he attempts to find the black organization, and restore his body to normal. All the while, Conan must keep Rachel from learning the truth of his identity, or risk her and her father being eliminated by the black organization.

The formula for Case Closed is basically 30-50 episode spans of Conan solving regular cases, as his relationship with Rachel (His relationship with her, in the form of Jimmy) begins to degrade due to their distance, and his relationship with her as Conan grows, with an episode related to the black organization every now and again. After 500+ episodes of the series in Japan, only about 20-30 have had any relation to the black organization, so when thinking about buying this series, I'd warn you that you may never get to see the end, unless you speak Japanese (I do) and have a friend that owns every single Japanese episode on DVD (which I also do). Overall, Case Closed is an at-times endearing series, with good mysteries for the first 200 episodes or so (at which point they all kind of blur together. There are only so many ways someone can get bumped off, and only so many possible motives for someone to do it)  The only problem is that I doubt Funimation will be dubbing any more episodes (please prove me wrong Funi..) so set 3 or 4 or whatever might be the last they ever release, when in fact they could release 20 sets and not reach the end of the series. The Black Organization is a truly worthwhile enemy, despite this being a ""For kids"" anime (considering it's 10 years old now, anyone that was a kid when it premiered, is now out of highschool probably. The stories have always been mature, but they are getting even moreso now. Yes, that's right, it's 10 years old, 500 episodes in, and it's STILL GOING IN JAPAN. You may never see the ending if you prefer dubs and don't speak Japanese).

This is the cheapest Detective Conan has ever been in the US, and I believe it's finally time for me to purchase it, considering that I've been a fan for many years now, and have thus far relied on my friend and on funimation TV reruns to get my Conan fix. Case Closed (Detective Conan in Japanese) is a gigantic investment as far as time and money goes, and considering that there are entire 26 episode animes you can get for the same price, I can see why people might be reluctant about this anime (especially considering the ratings were terrible on Cartoon Network), but if you give this show a chance, you might find a full 500 episode (and counting) saga to delve into.",1215129600,18,3355,4.614740368509213

3418708,5,B0018RCN5Y,"This is one hell of the most amazing anime servies ever, its a story about a detective and solving crimes the good old fashion way. Useing your mind. Enjoy the review!!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) Jimmy Kudo was a 17 year old detective who is the Japanese version of Sherlock Holmes. One day in the amusement park with his girlfriend Rachel Moore who is the daughter of the Richard Moore another detective who is jellous of Jimmy Kudo and how Kudo always seems to solve the cases and get all the glory. While at the amusement park Jimmy hears two men talking about a new poision they want to try out on their next target. When Jimmy confronts him the two men over power him and use the new poision on Jimmy! When they leave Jimmy for dead, instead of killing him it turns Kudo into a 10 year kid. So now going under the new name Conan Edogawa, Jimmy/Conan lies to Rachel about leaving the country but having his cousin ""Conan"" live with them for a while. So now Conan, along with Rachel go with Richard to solve every case they get hired for while looking for the men who tried to kill Jimmy Kudo.

Pros: Story: each episode is amazingly written out! It is one of the most tought provoking series that really wants to you to think ""who did it?"" ""how they did pull it off?"". Every episode I watch I try to figure out who is the villian and every time when you think your taking a right turn you turn left fast!! it is amazing how well the story is!

Cons: None yet

Over all: I love this series! I would get up early when it use to be shown on tv and watch the episodes. Buy this series!!",1430611200,2,1603,4.228758169934641
3418709,3,B0018RCN5Y,"First, I borrowed this series from my one friend and fell in love with the story. Jimmy Kudo is your average high schooler and is pretty well known as a detective. One day, he goes to the amusement park with his best friend, Rachel Moore where he notices some suspicious men in black. They tried to poison him but instead shrunk him into a young lad who took the name Conan Edogawa. Now, he lives with Rachel and her father, Richard, solving crimes and hoping to find out how to get his body back.

I got all excited when I received this package in the mail. The first thing I noticed was that the picture on the back and front look awful. It looks as though you could put 3D glasses on and they would pop out at you. I opened up the package to discover that I had 4 discs, which is what I was supposed to get. However, I got two disc 2.

3. The cardboard doesn't even matter. The DVD cases that hold the DVDs are in great condition and are protecting the DVDs perfectly.

This product is definitely worth buying.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the outer covering, but the product is definitely worth it and I completely recommend it.",1346716800,,476,4.488372093023256

This item was still wrapped when I got it so this damage happened in the factory. Not happy and I couldn't get my money back or return it....,1337558400,,290,4.105263157894737
3418745,5,B0018RCN5Y,I really enjoyed this anime. I've been a fan of Detective Konan for many years and I just got the chance to buy the first complete season. My younger brothers loved it!!!! We all like to watch it now and then. My goal is to own all the complete seasons.,1336608000,,253,4.08
3418746,3,B0018RCN5Y,"I think the story is excellent, along with the anime, but the dub of the series stink! I infinitely prefer the subbed Detective Conan, which you can watch at dctp.ws because the original Japanese voices are much more realistic and somehow feel as if they are more ""emotional"". Also, the subbed versions have the characters original Japanese names. I personally think replacing the names was a big mistake, and they should be their original names. For example, Jimmy Kudo is Shinichi Kudo, and Rachel Moore is Ran Mouri. One of the only names that stays the same is Edogawa Conan. Lastly, Funimation only has a fraction of 600+ episodes of Detective Conan, and so if you watch Case Closed, it will not develop the plot properly and introduce all the characters. So, overall, I think this is a good anime, but Funimation should have released more, released original names, and actually put satisfactory dubs!",1332115200,3,906,4.8896103896103895
3418747,4,B0018RCN5Y,"The Case Closed Season One DVD box set is a four-disc set that contains the first twenty-six episodes of the Case Closed anime series.  The first two discs have seven episodes, the third disc has six episodes, and the fourth disc has six episodes and the bonus features.

Case Closed is a mystery series done in a ""whodunit"" style, and a number of the episodes on this set focus on murder mysteries.  Unfortunately, in most of the episodes on this set, one element of this style is usually missing: the ""denouement,"" which is an epilogue that shows what happens to the characters after the case is solved.  For many of the stories, the episode ends right when the case is solved; this weakens some of the stories, because as a viewer, I became invested in what was happening, and I felt cheated that I didn't get to see what happened to some of them in the aftermath of solving the crime.  Overall, Case Closed is a decent series, but I do wish more of the episodes ended with a ""denouement.""

There are only three bonus features included on the fourth disc.  The first is a ""Character Spotlight"" for Conan Edogawa; this is one screen of text with a picture of the character to accompany it.  The second is ""Conan's Gadgets,"" which is one screen describing Conan's Super Sneakers; this is accompanied by a picture of Conan wearing the sneakers.  The final extra is a page with a menu for trailers.  I was a little underwhelmed by the bonus features, but knowing that Case Closed didn't perform all that well for FUNimation, I can understand why the company didn't go to a lot of effort when it came to bonus features for this set.

The Case Closed Season One box set is a decent release, and is worth adding to your DVD library if you're a fan of the Case Closed anime series.

I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD box set that my husband gave me as a gift.",1331596800,,1874,4.431486880466473
3418748,5,B0018RCN5Y,The show I have seen ever Case Closed Season and Movie that they would let you see in english they are The Best I would watch them over and over yes there is a lot of murder and kiddnapping but I got to say the main character is awsome i love his adittude toward things and people even the cases he is so serios and funny sometimes.,1322092800,,332,3.970149253731343
3418749,5,B0018RCN5Y,Gift for my best friend can't wait to see his reaction when he opens his present. So excited loved the series,1321833600,,109,4.238095238095238
3418750,4,B0018RCN5Y,"Case Closed is a Japanese murder-mystery anime. A fantastic series that dives deep into a criminals psyche, and never fails to keep you guessing. Each murder is different in some way, and nothing is ever as it seems. Now, the English dubbed episodes are being brought back into a series of box-sets, each containing 4 discs. Each disc carries an average of 5-6 episodes, each lasting roughly 21 minutes. The menu is easy to set-up and navigate and the special features and original Japanese sub/dub are a nice touch.

Despite it being a fantastic show, with interesting characters and gripping story, these box-sets have two flaws that I have noticed. The first noticeable flaw is in the arrangement of the discs. The case is set up so two discs are overlapping one another. This can be a pain if you want to watch disc 2 or 4, forcing you take out the first or third disc before you can access the second or fourth. It can also scratch the discs pretty easily, if not careful.

My other complaint lies with the previews. Each disc has a preview for another anime series, and it is unskippable. At first, it's not a huge deal. But when you begin to watch them religiously, they tend to get old, fast. Don't get me wrong, Dragon Ball Z and Yu-Yu Hakasho are awesome series in their own right, but after seeing the advertisement for them 25+ times, they tend to get old and you just want to skip them.

Overall, it's a fantastic purchase. The series is amazing, and the two major flaws are relatively minor in comparison to everything else. I highly recommend it to anyone who is into murder-mystery or anime.",1319414400,,1607,4.572916666666667

The show is about Jimmy Kudou who make the police force look like a fool by solving cases a lot quicker in more efficently. I'm not going to spoiled the show for you, so I'm going to get to the point;funimation has stop making cased closed because of sells so we need everybody to support this show you want regret it. In Japan the show is still running and they already made almost over 700 episode on the east side of the world.

If you force yourself to stick to this anime learning Japanese every day through this, I am sure it will take less than half a year until you start understanding it. Although, only watching it won't help, so looking up and understanding one sentence a day in the anime or other academical approach is needed, for learning Japanese though Anime!",1302652800,13,543,4.913043478260869

3418755,5,B0018RCN5Y,"This anime is one of the best if not THE best. It ranks as one of the classics. The show hooked me on the first episode and I fell in love with it. Long story short, highschool detevtive Kudo Shinichi or Jimmy Kudo turns into a seven year-old again by two men in black after witnessing a drug deal. He then takes on the name of Conan Edogawa and solves cases through Mouri Kogoro or Richard Moore.

The story line is a good one and the voice actors did a good job with the dub. However, if you're not thrilled with the dub, there's always the japanese dub with the english subtitles. Hopefully Funimation will dub more in the future. Like in the next two or three years. You can also pick up the other four seasons and 6 movies that have been released so far.

After all, it's as Conan says in the anime,""Only one truth prevails!""",1291939200,,833,4.238993710691824

So far I've only seen seasons 1-5, which is a shame. This show is for people who love investigating and mystery. The show has a lot of interesting crimes, and the way they were committed. Great show all together, I hope Funimation will release more of the seasons!",1291939200,,412,4.506666666666667

3418758,3,B0018RCN5Y,I bought a new season 1 set that is supposed to come with a lot of little neat extras. there were no extras and the dvd cases were broken allowing the dvds slide around in the cases. the dvds themselves work fine but the total package wasn't as high a quality as i expected.,1284854400,,274,4.092592592592593
3418759,5,B0018RCN5Y,"I picked up the entire tv series of Case Closed Via Viridian collection and I must say I am very pleased at the series. The viridian box sets are cheap but I mostly bought this show for the episodes. This show is very addictive, its almost like with every episode that passes you can't wait for the next to start. My only 2 complaints is that Funimation isn't dubbing anymore episodes and that the packaging of the Viridian collection isn't the most attractive looking boxes but I guess you get what you pay for.  I really hope people continue to pick up Case Closed so a dubbing company will one day continue releasing more episodes (hopefully with a great dub like this one).  With all that being said I really recommend picking up Case Closed if you want twists, turns and an all around great show.",1281571200,,801,4.47945205479452
3418760,5,B0018RCN5Y,"This show is one of the best anime shows there is.  This one has a beginning which explains everything which happened to turn 17 year old detective Jimmy, into a pint-sized 7 year old version of himself (whom assumes the alias Conan).  very entertaining and a must have for any avid anime fan, as well as anyone whom likes impossible to solve mysteries",1272758400,,352,4.571428571428571
3418761,5,B0018RCN5Y,"This hidden little GEM originally aired on the Cartoon Network at the wee hours after midnight. I don't think there is any graphic content (Blood and gore) in the show that required its airtime to be after midnight, but this is the US after all and most Japanese anime shows get censored one way or another if its airing on primetime TV. Needless to say, this show ended up getting canceled way too early and that shouldn't have been the case.

I was immediately hooked on the show from the very first episode that I saw. I didn't watch this from episode number one, but was intrigued nonetheless by the plot and murder mystery involved. However, I could never remember the exact show time and at that point in my life, I was too busy with work to have any free time to watch shows that I really liked. Case Closed is probably one of the greatest anime series to grace TV in my opinion. It ranks up there with Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball Z, but it's also in a class all its own since the genre is completely different.

The show starts off with teen detective sensation `Jimmy Kudo' solving a case. He is only seventeen years old, but is renowned for his detective skills and case solving expertise and is a bit of a celebrity in Japan where his efforts gets noticed in the local newspaper. Because of his popularity, he ends up getting most of the business and leaves Detective Richard Moore in the dust. Rachel, is Jimmy's best friend and harbors many strong feelings for him. Coincidentally, she is also Detective Moore's daughter. One day on a semi-date, Jimmy runs off to chase after some fishy looking men only to encounter his unfortunate fate. To make a long story short, Jimmy gets poisoned with an experimental drug that turns him into a kid and spends the rest of the series in the body of a pint size kid. In order to not get anyone in danger, he helps Detective Moore establish a bigger clientele base in hopes that over time he will eventually catch the men that did this to him. He does this by solving cases for Moore without him knowing. Jimmy gradually drops hints here and there to help Moore catch his culprit.

This is an addictive show and anyone who likes a murder mystery or a thriller will find themselves in love with the show as well. There is a great balance of humor and mystery. It's not an intense drama series, but its very light hearted and serious enough where it needs to be. Pick up this box set and watch all the excitement from the very beginning and follow Jimmy on his many adventures because ""Only One Truth Prevails.""

3418763,5,B0018RCN5Y,"Ok. So case closed!( also called detective conan) The best anime i know of! is being released in box sets but not just 1 but 2 different kind of box sets. Now don't worry, these sets are exactly the same. the boxing is the thing that makes them different. Case Closed Varidian Collection is less money because its packaging is weaker. its made of plastic. Over all i recomend the varidian collection because its cheaper and its THE SAME EXACT THING AS THE COMPLETE SERIES SET. Also you can tell its the varidian collection by locating the varidian sign on the top left of the box packaging.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Case-Closed-Season-One/dp/B00284EM3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Case Closed: Season One</a>",1271289600,37,751,5.654867256637168

When I finally go this Funimation release of ""Case Closed Series One,"" I popped in the first DVD to expecting to give it a quick watch and that was the end of my Saturday. I got sucked in and spent the next several hours watching episode after episode until I had almost watched the entire box set in a single day. I polished off the rest of the set the next day!

Obviously, ""Case Closed"" is a lot of fun, and a great anime series. There is a reason it is as popular as it is. Telling the story of teenage detective Kudo Shinichi, a popular and handsome high school student who is also a famous detective, Shinichi finds himself caught up in a case featuring black-coated members of a secret crime organization who poison Shinichi to keep him off their tails. Instead of killing him, the poison shrinks Shinichi down to a child-sized body while keeping his intellect intact. Realizing he is better off playing dead for the moment until he can find a cure for the poison, Shinichi adopts the alias of Edogawa Conan after two of his favorite mystery writers and continues on solving mysteries.

""Case Closed"" is only about half ""boy Sherlock Holmes"" with the other half being ""boy James Bond."" Conan's ally Professor Agasa serves as Conan's ""Q,"" setting him up with high-tech gadgets to help Conan compensate for his childlike body and to add some action to the series. The episodes are pretty evenly split between mystery-orientated showing off Conan's detective skills and full on action/adventure.

There is a big ensemble cast to help along, like Mori Ran, Conan's lady interest back when he was the full sized Kudo Shinichi, but who now treats him like an Elementary school student, and Ran's father Mori Kogoro, a bumbling detective who manages to take the credit for all of Conan's discoveries. Conan also gets himself a little gang of ""junior detectives"" made up of his elementary school classmates who help out from time-to-time.

The big laughs of ""Case Closed"" comes from Conan having to deal with being trapped in a kid's body. Here is someone with a genius IQ being sent back to elementary school and being given rabbit-shaped balloons from girls when he would rather get a kiss. The series does a lot of good with this rather odd plot point, especially when dealing with Ran and her ""babying"" of Conan all the while longing for Shinichi, never realizing they are one and the same.

The only real drawback of the series is a nitpicky minor one. I realize that there are some legal entanglements from using the name ""Conan"" here in the West, due to its association with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conan-the-Cimmerian/dp/0345461517/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conan the Cimmerian</a>&nbsp;rather than Arthur Conan Doyle, but I am not a fan of the new title ""Case Closed."" Also, when doing the English-language track Funimation did more than just dub the series but gave it a whole ""Western overall."" Kudo Shinichi became Jimmy Kudo. Mori Ran became Rachel Moore. I didn't like this when it was done with the series Card Captor Sakura (Daidoji Tomoyo becoming ""Madison Taylor"") and I don't like it here either. Fortunately, with a quick swipe of the remote control button, the Japanese-language soundtrack can be selected and all such worries fall away.

I am definitely a Conan fan and will be picking up the rest of the series!

Note: Like all Funimation ""Viridian Collection"" releases, this is a bare-bones and lower-priced release of the Season One box set.  It is a great way to get into the series if you are new to it like I was.",1262995200,,4564,5.564841498559078
3418765,3,B0018RCN5Y,"Case Closed (Detective Conan in Japan) is a fantastic mystery anime that spans 11 seasons, almost 600 episodes, and soon to be 14 movies. It follows the story of a genius 17 year old named Jimmy Kudo who solves horribly difficult mysteries that leave the police dazed and confused. Well one day while out with his childhood friend (Racheal Moore) he sees a man in black doing a shady deal and while he watches it happen another man in black comes and knocks him out. To get rid of Jimmy they decide to use an untested drug on him that was supposed to kill him. Instead it turned him into an 8 year old child. He then decides to take the alias Conan Edagawa so that the men who druged him won't know that he is still alive and to protect the ones around him. With the new name he moves into Racheal's house and begins to help her dad (Detective Richard Moore) solve cases in the hope that one will lead to information on the men in black. Each episode follows pretty much the same formula. A crime happens and then Jimmy/Conan collects clues and reavels the culprit.

  All that aside. This box set is just a cheaper re-release of season 1. It has all the same episodes as the original season 1 release. One thing it doesn't have are the few extras that the original release does. So to buy this one would be cheaper, but you would get no extras eventhough there are very few to begin with in the original. I am sorry I have gone on a small rant. I am not saying not buy it. I nfact I encourage you to buy it. I am just angry that funimation as decided to re-release season 1 rather than continuing to release the other seasons.

  So if you love mystry then I highly recommened that you buy this anime. I just gave it a 3 because it is a re-release.",1262649600,6,1749,4.221556886227545

3418767,4,B0018RCN5Y,"It's a rough life being a teenage detective genius -- crimes happen everywhere, and strange people may shrink you into a small child. Such are the problems for Jimmy Kudo in ""Case Closed: Season 1 ,"" a solid little mystery series with a healthy dollop of comic relief and romance -- the mysteries are a bit spotty, but promise to improve drastically. Just try not to have the Anglicized names annoy you.

Jimmy Kudo is a detecting genius, to the point where the police call him in all the times and he gets fanmail from girls. But at a trip to the amusement park with his childhood friend Rachel, he has to solve a gruesome beheading on a rollercoaster. And when he later witnesses a blackmail payoff, he's knocked unconscious and force-fed a poison by a pair of mysterious men in black. And they're not as nice as Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.

When Jimmy wakes, he's horrified -- he's de-aged ten years. His old friend, kooky scientist Dr. Agasa, says that he must keep his true identity a secret to keep the MIBs from returning -- and he should live with Rachel and her dad until he can find the mysterious men, and have Agasa make an antidote. But while Rachel's dad Richard is a detective, he's a pretty inept one. So Jimmy -- now using the name ""Conan Edogawa"" -- must solve the cases through hints, dropped clues, and some James-Bondian gadgets (provided by Agasa).

But the cases he has to deal with are pretty hair-raising -- among his problems are gold-smuggling Mafioso, train bombs, kidnappings, a pop idol with a corpse in her apartment, a piano melody that heralds death, a man stabbed by a suit of armor, unbreakable alibis, a man poisoned seemingly by nothing, a poisoned bride, an amnesiac, a man impaled after a savage battle (which nobody heard), a department store infested with thieves, a disappearing dead body, and a cruise ship with a very hostile (and murderous) family on board.

""Case Closed Season 1"" is the beginning of a very, very long anime series that still hasn't concluded over in Japan -- and while the first few episodes of the series introduce an overarcing plot, the rest of the season is essentially devoted to a series of standalone murder mysteries. Expect lots of tension, red herrings, obscure clues, and moderate outpourings of blood'n'gore (including a beheaded man's neck spewing blood... in the very first episode).

But it's also a pretty solidly-written mystery series, with a unique dilemma and some very odd crime-solving methods (dog-riding! Treasure maps!) as well as the usual clues and inconsistencies. Even more strikingly, many of the criminals aren't portrayed as just being bad, but are given realistic motives and often a sense of regret over their actions. There is also it a hefty dose of humor (""Little boy?!""), usually from the inept Richard. And there are some flickers of he-bugs-me-but-I-love-him romance between Rachael and Jimmy, which is somewhat hampered by his tiny prepubescent body.

What are its flaws? Well, all the names are Anglicized (""Shinichi"" becomes ""Jimmy,"" and so on), and his little preteen pals are kinda grating. It's hard to see why Jimmy puts up with their hyperactive idiocy in so many episodes.

Fortunately Jimmy himself is a pretty endearing character despite being a genius who is fully aware of that fact -- he's also kind, sharp-witted, and a massive detective geek who prattles endlessly about Sherlock Holmes. And he's understandably frustrated by his transformation, especially since it puts a damper on his burgeoning romance. Rachael seems too grumpy at first, she's soon fleshed out into a butt-kicking yet sensitive heroine, while her father Richard serves mainly as the comic relief (and Jimmy's ventriloquist's dummy).

""Case Closed Season 1"" is a solid premiere season for this odd mystery series, and despite the annoying first-graders, it's a fast-paced and well-written collection of episodes.",1257292800,3,3906,4.9526717557251905
3418768,4,B0018RCN5Y,"It's a rough life being a teenage detective genius -- crimes happen everywhere, and strange people may shrink you into a small child. Such are the problems for Jimmy Kudo in ""Case Closed: Season 1 ,"" a solid little mystery series with a healthy dollop of comic relief and romance -- the mysteries are a bit spotty, but promise to improve drastically. Just try not to have the Anglicized names annoy you.

Jimmy Kudo is a detecting genius, to the point where the police call him in all the times and he gets fanmail from girls. But at a trip to the amusement park with his childhood friend Rachel, he has to solve a gruesome beheading on a rollercoaster. And when he later witnesses a blackmail payoff, he's knocked unconscious and force-fed a poison by a pair of mysterious men in black. And they're not as nice as Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.

When Jimmy wakes, he's horrified -- he's de-aged ten years. His old friend, kooky scientist Dr. Agasa, says that he must keep his true identity a secret to keep the MIBs from returning -- and he should live with Rachel and her dad until he can find the mysterious men, and have Agasa make an antidote.

When I first started watching it again, I didn't like it very much, but once I got to episode 5 or 6 I started seeing why I loved it so long ago.

3418771,5,B0018RCN5Y,"Quick Plot Summary

The anime is about young Jimmy Kudo who is a very talented detective. One day while on a date with his girlfriend Rachel Moore he witnesses something shady happening and is attacked for hit. The men in black who attacked him then give him a poison that is supposed to kill him but it ends up turning him into a six year old child. Still alive Jimmy takes the alias of Conan Edagawa and moves in with Rachel and her idiot father Richard Moore who happens to be a detective. Using devices given to him by his friend, Dr. Edagawa, he solves all of Richard's cases in the hopes of discovering who the men in black are and getting back to his origonal age.

Case Closed is a very good anime. The comedy is awsome with the bubbling Richard Moore and the cases will have you racking your brain every second trying to figure out who did it before the reveal who did it. There are occasional episodes where Conan solves cases with a group of kids, Junior Detective League, from an elementary school that fill like filler episodes and the men in black are not mentioned again until later into the other seasons. For the most part though the first season of Case Closed is very well down and will keep you on your toes. It is a most have for any crime show fan and for any fan of anime.",1242777600,3,1295,4.281632653061225

A friend of mine showed me case closed and I instantly got hooked. The series has just the right amount of humor and seriousness mixed into it. Its not too gory as an anime and I have to admit that the ways in which people die in the series is....creative, wouldn't recommend trying them on anyone even on people you dislike. All in all great series if you like a good murder/mystery show and don't mind alot of repetition.",1484265600,4,580,4.533333333333333
