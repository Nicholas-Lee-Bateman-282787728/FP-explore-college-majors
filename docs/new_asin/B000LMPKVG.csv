8493292,5,B000LMPKVG,"This is a wondeful film, especially if you are a fan of classic style Bollywood films.  There are some great musical numbers in the film, the costumes are wonderful, and, in my opinion, two of the best actors ever, Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit, are the leads.  Romance, action and comedy.  This film has it all!
Enjoy!",1286841600,,319,4.56140350877193
