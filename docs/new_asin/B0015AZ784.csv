8258018,1,B0015AZ784,"Don't waste your money.  Now that HD TV is the standard (at least at our house, it is), this DVD is very poor quality footage.  It's like looking out the window after your big dog just licked it.  The only stuff that looks halfway decent are the black and white photos, which are clear.  Most of the video is pretty mundane.  It would be spectacular in HD.",1480032000,,356,4.253731343283582
8258019,5,B0015AZ784,This DVD is very well done. It covers the Grand Canyon in a very sensitive way and enhances the tour in preparation for my guests to arrive at the Canyon. !,1382140800,,156,4.064516129032258
