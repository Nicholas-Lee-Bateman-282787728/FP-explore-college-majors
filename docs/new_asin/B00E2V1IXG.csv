5886758,5,B00E2V1IXG,"Pineapple Express is, in my opinion, one of the best plotted, funniest comedy stories ever put to screen. Every single part of that movie is absolute perfection.

Superbad is amazing as well. One of the comedies I can watch again and again and never get bored.

Year One is probably my number 1 guilty pleasure movie. I know it's not a good film by any means, but I enjoy it immensely.

I haven't yet watched Youth in Revolt, so I can't comment.",1469577600,,445,4.402439024390244

8600420,5,B00E2V1IXG,"There are four movies in this collection three of them are modern comedy classics. Superbad and Pineapple Express are 5/5 films, Youth in Revolt is a 4/5 film its only downside is Michael Cera is too much like his Superbad  character without Jonah Hill. Year One is funny but a bit weaker than the others an average 3/5. The movies lack special features and even a scene selection menu but a lot of these bundle packs do. For what you are buying it's a five star collection. The lack of special features doesn't bother me this isn't the Criterion Collection here.",1512086400,,563,4.574257425742574
