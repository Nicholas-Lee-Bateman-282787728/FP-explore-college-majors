7597206,5,B01AB4Y7T4,"I've come to realize that When Calls the Heart is like the soap operas that my mom watched when I was a kid. They go on and on and on. That's not bad, we like the characters. ~smile~ But like life, the stories don't begin at seven p.m., have a crisis at 7:45, and resolve at 8:30! It's not a neat little package. They just make you want more. ~smile~ When I agreed to review When Calls the Heart, I had no idea what I was getting into! As long as there are still troubled hearts in Hope Valley, we get to keep watching one of the most wholesome series I've seen in a long time. Win! My daughters and I look forward to watching as the new installments come out.  I love the convenience of DVD, because I can watch during the odd moments rather than at a set time someone else dictates.

I really liked Troubled Hearts. It was neat seeing Elizabeth learning new skills as she fixed up her row house, Rosemary helping Lee in her flighty yet responsible way, and seeing some steps forward in the maturing of several characters. I think that is something I've liked about the series. Even though they are adults, all of the main characters are growing up in their thinking and behaviors as time passes. Even the villain, Mr. McGowen, shows a bit of kindness.

There was one scene that had me talking to the t.v.because sometimes, Jack and Elizabeth need to talk openly. In fact, if they'd just say what they were thinking, the residents of Hope Valley could save another episode or two of misunderstandings and/or hurt feelings. On the other hand, we keep coming back to see how they iron out the wrinkles that they make themselves. I guess the formula works.

Anyhow, it was another enjoyable afternoon spent in Hope Valley.
Thank you Edify Media for this review copy.",1462579200,,1764,4.452012383900929
7597207,5,B01AB4Y7T4,"Looking for a television series that is great for all ages? Check out Hallmark Channel's When Calls the Heart Series, based on the novel from author Janette Oke and executive producer Michael Landon Jr. Now in its third season, the DVD When Calls the Hearts: Troubled Hearts is released to fans of the series known simply as ""Hearties!""

The entire series is based on a fictional town in the west known simply as Hope Valley, formerly Coal Valley. Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow) leaves her well to do family in Hamilton to head west in search not only for adventure but answering the ad for a school teacher. She falls in love with Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing), a Canadian Mounty, and realizes that she has finally found a true home. In this episode, Elizabeth finally has her own home, at last after living with Abigail Stanton (Lori Loughlin), owner of the cafe. She is excited as she prepares to write her novel of life on the frontier in her new home but first it will need more than fixing up and Jack is just the person to lend a hand. He had hoped that one day he would build her a home, but for now those plans are on hold.

Rosemary begins to see signs that her love interest Lee Colter, the owner of the Sawmill might be having financial difficulties and she lends a hand helping him to economize and save money at every opportunity without first confronting him. She believes its not her place to ask if he needs money. Meanwhile just as things are beginning to look up for Abigail as she expresses an interest in Pastor Frank, an unexpected visitor Jesse shows up to make things difficult based on Frank's past he is keeping hidden. Things are about to get complicated once again for the residents of Hope Valley!

I received When Calls the Heart: Troubled Hearts compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Group for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation aside from a free copy of the DVD in exchange for my heartfelt and honest opinions. There honestly has not been much I don't like about this series, except that you have to wait for each new season! The DVD's however help to pass the time. This one includes exclusive behind the scenes interviews  and runs about 84 minutes in length for the feature. This is truly one series that every single member can enjoy and fans of Little House on the Prairie will definitely want to make sure you pick this entire series up from the beginning. It has humor, romance, adventure and a few tears along the way as you cheer on your favorite character or couple! For me, another 5 out of 5 stars!",1462147200,,2577,4.523605150214593
7597208,5,B01AB4Y7T4,"I just love the When Calls the Heart series. This is Season 3 and Troubled Hearts is Movie 2. I look forward to each and every one of the shows. Just wholesome, interesting, pure enjoyment in each show.
  So many things are going on that you are never bored and you love the show so much you don't want it to end.
  Jack and Elizabeth are both looking to the future in getting houses of their own. Rosemary is trying to be a part of Lees life, but she just gets things are mixed up. Another really exciting part is when the new boy Jesse is trying to cause trouble with Frank and is given an old wanted poster.
  I really like and enjoy this series. Its hard to have favorites, but I really like Pastor Frank, Rosemary and Lee. Of course the best ones are Jack and Elizabeth.
  Truly a wonderful, entertaining show full of love, surprises and adventure. You never know what will happen next. Highly recommended. The whole family will love this series.

7597213,4,B01AB4Y7T4,"This movie is number two in season three of the When Calls the Heart series and like all its predecessors, it continues to entertain, challenge and teach us. The series is inspired by the novel of the same name by Canadian author, Janette Oke.
Also like all previous episodes, Troubled Hearts has a host of sub-plots  each one somehow intertwined with the others and each one with a special lesson for viewers.  From young Codys hatred for school and those taking care of him as an orphan to the women who have suffered the loss of spouses and yet again being betrayed by the men they have dared to be attracted to.  And the criminal element is also well-represented  both at the murderous gangster level (those youd like to put away for life) and at the weasel level (those whose necks youd like to wring and make them pay back every cent they embezzled).
Yes, of course, theres romance.  This time I counted it developing on four fronts for sure and a possible fifth, complete with some very touching moments and the promise of more to come in the future in most cases. Throughout the movie, building trusting and nurturing relationships are paramount. And even though there are numerous characters, all the main ones are well-developed. Villains are dealt with and those that have erred have a change of heart or mind.  Wrongs are made right. But unlike the fairy tales we read as children or the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys novels we enjoyed, there is no indication that everything has ended well -- the main reason being, of course, that theres more to come from Michael Landon, Jr.
Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention that both Oke and Landon, Jr. made a special effort to have some of the movies script sound like words from the Bible. Its done very well and its very apropos, but I wonder how many would even recognize it.
We watched with our almost 11- and 13-year-old grandchildren as well as our senior neighbor  and all enjoyed it thoroughly. Highly recommended for the whole family, whether accompanied by popcorn or not.  And yes, Im looking forward to still more  one of the few fiction works I allow myself these days.
