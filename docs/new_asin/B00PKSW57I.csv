I do however have a couple of issues with the dvd disk.  It is ""only"" dvd that i have that while its playing makes this low sounding grrrrr noise  it was so bad on the first one I ordered amazon replaced it for free and it happens with the new one they sent me  Like i said none of my other dvd's have ever done that.
Also at the very beginning of the dvd it says to set the video to loop.  Really well i have a pretty basic sony dvd player and there is no ""loop"" on it.  What i don't understand is why the looping wasn't automatically put into the dvd itself.  i just recently bought another fireplace video and it constantly loops.
I do love this fireplace video very much its exactly the type of fire i was looking for.
I would have given this a 5 star rating just or that but because of the other 2 issues i had with the disc i gave it a
2 star review.",1515024000,,927,3.8219895287958114

8688505,5,B00PKSW57I,I love it because I made this video so I am impartial. It is a relaxing video to play during the holidays or anytime. It has a soft crackling fireplace sound with it or you can play whatever music you would like. It is widescreen and I believe shot far better than many of the exiting fireplace videos out there. I took great care in getting the crackle just right and getting all the logs placed properly for framing. I know it's a bit geeky but it is really more work than you would imagine making a video like this. Fun just the same. I hope you enjoy it. Please review it whether you like it or hate it. (I hope you don't hate it!).,1415923200,,636,4.096
