8268209,5,B00180R08Q,"I have the privilege of living in Ithaca and taking classes with Zipi twice a week, and they are great! She has a devoted following, and everyone has positive success stories. I have already lost weight and feel much better than when I began her classes. I purchased the DVD's to use when I travel and when the weather is too bad in upstate NY to attend her classes, and have found them to be as comprehensive as her in-person instruction. This DVD requires nothing more than a little space and an elastic band that can be easily purchased online or at a local sporting goods store. I highly recommend Zipi's positive method and thorough instruction!",1237852800,3,650,4.612068965517241
