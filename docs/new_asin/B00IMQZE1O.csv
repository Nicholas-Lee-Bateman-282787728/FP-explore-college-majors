6281928,4,B00IMQZE1O,"Another micro-budget horror movie, but this one seems to have been shot using a higher end HD camera. Daylight scenes look fantastic.
There is some decent bloodshed, some nudity and the usual bad acting, but I had fun watching.
I would rate 3 stars, but give extra Star cause Debbie D. is in it. She was great in her tiny, yet memorable role.",1432425600,,342,4.444444444444445
6281929,1,B00IMQZE1O,Turned it off after about 15 minutes.,1427155200,,37,4.428571428571429
6281930,5,B00IMQZE1O,Thought it was a good horror film. Looked like the actors were newbees but did a good job. Really liked Gail Brewer.,1426377600,,116,4.318181818181818
6281931,2,B00IMQZE1O,Where did they find these actors?  The bad actor's guild?  Or perhaps they are porn industry rejects.  It was a pretty pathetic movie.,1425513600,4,134,4.739130434782608
6281932,1,B00IMQZE1O,"Ridiculouly bad, from start to... 30 minutes in, which is all I could take. It's laughably bad, actually, from the very first 10 minutes when a cop arrives to arrest Jeb, who just shot the guy sent to serve ole Jeb an eviction notice and, walking up to Jeb who is holding a loaded shotgun, not only doesnt take his weapon out of his holster as a precaution, but... ah, nevermind... you'll see. It's not worth expending any more energy reviewing this thing thsn the officer took not drawing his sidearm. Microbudget, c-movie, train wreck.",1424822400,,537,4.663157894736842

6281934,1,B00IMQZE1O,"ridiculous flick about a deranged maniac who couldn't pay the taxes on his property and goes on murderous rampage.

2 multi racial couples want to buy the land and local tells them they won't be welcome.

They insist and spend the rest of the movie trying to get a clue.

I don't know what happens in between. There are lots of really asinine people running around having sex and being axed to death.

I  didn't finish the flick. I have better things to do, thank you very much.",1423267200,2,478,4.386363636363637
6281935,2,B00IMQZE1O,"I can't in all honesty give this indie horror movie a good rating, but I can also honestly tell you that its by far not the worst movie out there either. It is a story of revenge, adultery, lies, death and taxes. Good ol boy Jeb is behind on his taxes and isn't about to let the assessor or the sheriff take his home and land away from him as long as he is alive. I think you know where this story is headed, don't you? Fast forward a few weeks/months and enter some friends looking for some land to invest in and section off for their future home sites. Jeb's back and he's still not about to let anyone take his property and neither death nor taxes will stand in his way to keep people off his land. Jeb's tool of choice is the double bit axe.
The acting, writing and direction are about what you would expect in a low budget movie and lack the experience and knowledge that a seasoned production crew and actors rely on to produce good works of art. The special effects are at/kept to a minimum (a good thing for this budget) and are almost ok. I will say I did like on scene with the axe and the way it was edited it looked like a real hit. The blood and gore are also at a minimum (again good for this budget as it would have looked worse because this is a very weak point) and the editing is where they could have made this work better, but as I mentioned I only found one scene that was well done. There is some mild violence and cursing with an fword thrown in a few times and there is nudity during sex scenes. The movie is just over an hour long so its up to you if you want to give this one a try. 2.4 stars. Some may enjoy this and some won't!",1423180800,,1655,4.003021148036254

8643460,4,B00IMQZE1O,"It Was a good axe slasher/killer movie. Billy Leo is a great actor and great person in real life. In this movie he did a great job at portraying his character and i give him 2 thumbs up! I did also liked  Earl Loveday, John Baran and Gail Brewer. I would like to see more movies with Billy Leo though :).......how ever debra needs acting classes and and english class...her acting and pronunciation of her lines were bad...i could not understand her some of the time...and why was she the one to survive??",1478044800,,505,4.43010752688172

8643464,3,B00IMQZE1O,"People may take one look at this movie and not think much about it. I thought it had its good moments and bad but i liked the acting for some strange reason it kept me glued to the tv screen until the end. I guess if you like maniac movies with strong scenes of killing with a axe then check it out. But i pacifically liked when it was night and the outside was real dark when you heard the crickets. I have a thing for the l yards and driveways and thing. This was a good movie, i enjoyed the 75min watching!",1458172800,,509,3.9514563106796117
8643465,5,B00IMQZE1O,"An Excellent AxeSlasher/Horror Flik, Despite being Filmed with a Low Budget .
  There is no more Beautiful, Stacked & Shapely, & Talented Actress Today than SHERI DAVIS; & SHE stands out in this Great Ensemble Cast, that also includes Deborah Funes in a Leading Role, & the Always Lovely DEBBIE D, Who [thankfully] is Still Willing & Able to share Her fine Attributes with Her Adoring Fans !!!
  There are no dull moments, while the story carries on at an accelerated Pace; & there's enough blood & Gore to Satisfy most everyone's Blood Lust .If given the chance, don't miss this Cult Favorite & soon to be ""Classic"" !!!",1456012800,,620,4.660550458715596

8643469,1,B00IMQZE1O,"Holy cow was this movie stupid.  You know it's awful when Jebediah just murders a guy and ONE cop shows up, without even his gun drawn.  They shoot him and then just decide to bury the body?  Why?

Why is the only response I can have to this movie...made by amateurs, acted by amateurs, it's just awful.  Why was the haggard girl who can't be understood given a lead role?  Why are all of the actors so terrible...newsflash movie makers, you can usually go to a local theatre group and try to find people who are at least not terrible.

Man, what a dopey movie.  Glad it was free!",1433548800,,580,4.256880733944954
