8373621,4,B002M9FXHC,Spencer is a likable actor and great for the roles he plays.  Sure the films are a lot of mayhem and ridiculous fights but Spencer adds a lot of laid back character.  He also has a lot of good chemistry with any small children he acts with.  Letieri usually has roles as really bad men.  It was nice to see him as a good guy.,1491696000,,325,3.953846153846154
