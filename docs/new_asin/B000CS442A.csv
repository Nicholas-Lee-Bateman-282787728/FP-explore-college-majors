8485774,5,B000CS442A,"I purchased Digital Exposure Control by Will Crockett to help me get the most out of my digital camera and reduce the amount of time I spend in PhotoShop CS2.

Mr. Crockett not only explains his methods and shows great examples but also gives you the confidence to know that with the proper equipment and technique you can begin to produce excellent images with a minimum of post processing after the capture.

The information contained on the DVD is very clear and concise and is presented in a very easy to understand format with plenty of examples and is well worth the purchase price.

Many tips and examples presented thru out the DVD will help you whether you are a Pro or an aspiring amateur photographer.

The secret to making great images is a quality lightmeter, good glass, pro grade camera and the information contained on Digital Exposure Control by Will Crockett.",1168646400,3,877,4.75
