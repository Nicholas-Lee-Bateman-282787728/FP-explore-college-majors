7933449,4,B000059HE0,"This movie has great fight scenes, some over the top characters, and dry comedy.  It's exactly what I expected.",1454284800,,111,4.842105263157895
7933450,5,B000059HE0,"this was nice until the end, it is super raw because of the ending, gotta see it to understand, 1 of the best martial arts endings ever, but you must watch whole movie to get the full effect.",1361836800,,191,4.052631578947368
7933451,3,B000059HE0,"Yeah this movie did have great action in it, but my reason for a 3'star rating was because of the picture quality and editing miscues, but overall it's pretty good! Plus maybe i need to more movies of Dragon Lee or Fake'Lee...he's decent with his skillz but i still say the end fight with tha Master', he should have lost! They could've thrown Bruce Li' in there and he would've made a better showing ( more charisma)! This movie should be remastered to get a better rating....but a good pickup for true kungfu fans!!!",1174176000,,518,4.5212765957446805
7933452,4,B000059HE0,"Based on the hype, right here on amazon, I rushed out the get this flick, and yes,,I do agree it really is an amazing old school performace by Dragon lee,,aka,,Casanova lee. I really enjoyed this from the start to finish,,,there were really no boaring parts.  This is definately a must have,,,you can't go wrong!!",1151712000,,313,4.796296296296297
7933453,5,B000059HE0,"The first time I went to N.Y. C. Time Square was when I was little,and my dad took me to see two Dragon Lee flix. He is mad crazy! Built like Arnold and with Bruce's face. Dude makes these weird face expressions.he's off the hook. So I can understand why the Wu Tang family would put Dragon Lee in they line up. All the flix I've seen with him have been wild,including this one. He fights this snake fist dude,and a iron Belly master and other strange styles. RZA talks this up before the flick. It's a crazy flick,but you'll really like it. Bring some friends over and kick back with Dragon Lee!!Peace!!",997315200,2,604,4.353982300884955
7933454,5,B000059HE0,"Dragon Lee plays a young bodyguard workin for a local merchant, after money is stolen he decides to use his muscle to stop the bandits.  After taking out many bad guys he realizes that the man behind it is his one time school mate.  Dragon Lee is great in this movie, and Casanova Wong is amazing again as the fast kicking villian.  A must see.",987984000,,344,4.2615384615384615
