7507726,4,B017KNPQVW,Very informative,1474243200,,16,7.5
7507727,4,B017KNPQVW,We were enlightened by this story about the family life of such an important man in our world's history.  No matter how it was embellished for the film.  Very enjoyable film.,1473984000,,174,4.580645161290323
7507728,5,B017KNPQVW,"I read the other reviews, and was surprised some were negative, due to historical inaccuracy,  however, it is called Masterpiece Drama, not Masterpiece Documentary, I took this into account before watching it that there would be some historical license.  I really enjoyed it, my biggest complaint is that it was only one program/movie and not a series.  I thought the actors were good but Gambon was great.  It was entertaining. Michael Gambon! An acting giant if ever there was one.
It is worth watching if you are a Masterpiece fan.  If you want a super accurate account of his strokes and this ""crisis"" this may not be the most educational program.  Personally I thought Churchill was a power monger and ego maniac, but this program humanized him for me.",1473724800,2,757,4.829457364341085
7507729,3,B017KNPQVW,"The acting was superb. Churchill suffers a stroke and it is hidden while he rehabilitates privately. It is set in 1953. The family gathers and there is massive undercurrents of anger from his children. The issues are not explained, if you don't know about his children, you're lost. This is an incomplete movie since it doesn't explain any of the back stories. The anger the children display towards their mother is  confusing to say the least. I would suggest that you read up on the Churchill family prior to watching this movie so you aren't lost.",1473638400,2,550,4.729166666666667
7507730,5,B017KNPQVW,"This single episode independent British-made television film which will air on PBSs Masterpiece Theatre on September 11, 2016 (two days after I post this review- I was provided with an advance screener)  is not only a fascinating look in a three-week period of Sir Winston Churchills life  which was never written about until author Jonathan Smiths book of historic fiction but a tour de force of acting by British actor Michael Gambon. He actually looks like  and walks like Churchill. It was broadcast in February 2016 on Britains commercial ITV network.

If youve read my other reviews of DVDs on Amazon, you will know that I hate spoilers . and Im hesitant about providing the next sentence, but I feel it is important to guide you. This is a work of historic fiction, based on real events, and all the characters were real except one  the nurse who cares for Churchill. Smith used this character to bring all the events together, and do it in under two hours. So think of this as you do other Masterpiece Theatre programs, not always accurate history but a powerful story.

I didn't see the PBS airing but it may have been edited for broadcast. The film on the DVD runs 110 minutes which is standard running time for Masterpiece Theater. But, Im fairly certain that the Broadcast version did not include the one profane word that stats with the letter S. Maybe it was bleeped. It is only said once and there is no violence or other graphic language here.

Gambon is the star, but its actress Romola Garal, as Millie (the nurse) gets even more screen time as the character bringing everyone together. Shes great and you will love her (I did!). And, as I said Gambon is fantastic.

The DVD contains a 12-minute bonus feature  a featurette on the making of the film  with the main cast and production team. I found it very informative and it was good to hear from the writer as well as learning about the location where it was film.  Well worth watching.

Yes, at  under two hours it was difficult to go into any depth about other members of Churchills family  his son and daughters  but it was, at least for me, time well spent watching it.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7507731,1,B017KNPQVW,"Finally, after wading through this dramatization, adapted from the book ""The Churchill Secret KBO"" by Jonathan Smith, I am no less appalled by this production although somewhat entertained.  Like economists, on the one hand I had a good chuckle but on the other hand I was disgusted with the perversion of history.  As Lady Soames has said of her father, and an adage of The Churchill Centre, we should ""keep the memory green"", hardly achieved here except for TV sensationalism,  and ""the record accurate"" of her father.  Certainly the latter is far from it, if really ever achieved in this glitzy production.  To be fair it is based on some supposed  historical ""givens"" but it is a far cry from the likes of the novelist, Lord Michael Dobbs, and his charming 4 books of fiction involving Churchill, who with rare exceptions, is faithful to the historical record.
So what is one to think of all of the gaffs in this production and why is it important to puncture the myths it espouses?  First of all while the ""stroke"" Churchill suffered in 1953 was kept a well organized secret, it has hardly been a secret ever since 1966 when his physician, Lord Moran published his ""Diary"" of the 25 years when he was Churchill's primary physician.  Immediately there is a glaring error as there is no mention of Lord Brain at all.  He had been Churchill's neurologist since 1949 when Churchill had had his first ""stoke"" in the South of France.  He had also seen him in the interim for episodes of Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) or brief interruptions of the blood circulation to the brain.
These transient episodes were not known at that time.  In June 1953 with his second ""real' stroke (the first stroke in 1949 was also brushed aside) the cover up was not primarily a creature of his physicians (Lords Brain and Moran) but rather his political entourage, including Lord Salisbury, Rab Butler and Christopher Soames his son in law.  They amended and downplayed the substance of the Medical Bulletin originally prepared by Brain and Moran, eliminating any allusion to an impairment due to a reduced circulation of blood to his brain.  Then the media was corralled, Churchill's ""cronies"" as Clemmie called them, Lords Beaverbrook. Bracken and Camrose, to maintain his political colleagues 'fiction'.  This production covers this well but again does not adequately expose the collusion of so many political ""operatives"" in this 'song and dance show'.  Anthony Montague Brown had become Churchill's permanent Private Secretary in 1952 and where was his detective, Sergeant Ed Murray, who performed a vital service in keeping the suspicious reporters at bay outside Chartwell's front gates.
There are many scenes in this production that are very disturbing and space here does not permit a full exposure of all of its ""errors"".  For instance, the role played by Anthony Eden, who was actually medically indisposed himself, as he never did go to Chartwell at this critical time when Churchill was thought to be at death's door, according to his widow, Lady Avon.  The perseveration of Winston and Clemmie on the premature loss of their daughter Marigold to septicemia or was it actually diphtheria.  The squabbles amongst his children are wildly overplayed, when there is evidence that the expressions of their anxieties were much more muted.
The portrayal in the film of the 1953 stroke (including the dragging of Churchills left foot as he is carted into Chartwell) far exceeds the severity supported by the medical files of Lords Brain and Moran. The medical record shows that Churchill had a steady and relatively quick recovery and was never in a prolonged state of a left hemiparesis (loss of power and sensation of the left arm and leg.) Certainly he never suffered total paralysis as implied by this production. And the notion that Churchills brain was so befuddled that he then did a lot of humming of nursery rhymes during his convalescence is completely contradicted by the medical evidence recorded by both his physicians.
Perhaps the most objectionable feature of this dramatization is the creation, out of nowhere, a nurse, Ms. Appleyard who is from St. Mary's hospital (Lord Moran had been Dean of the medical school there until 1935) although it is not evident how she was chosen.  Her performance is high drama and yet we know that it was a team of nurses who were brought in to take care of Churchill's basic medical needs and activities of daily living.  Maybe it was necessary for a compelling story but unfortunately this re-writing of history is very unhelpful.  One nurse as the archetype of all the platoons of nurses who were brought in forgets that Churchill had had other nurses before then when he had had and then recovered from his first stroke.  Soon after this 1953 episode, Ivan Shepherd and his wife Elizabeth, and then the indefatigable Roy Howell, joined the nursing staff in ongoing care for Churchill.
Eventually Churchill is shown to have recovered from this stoke by his indomitable will (hence the KBO) and sheer determination, so that four months later at the Conservative Party's Annual Conference in Margate he is able to give a towering performance with smiles all around.  Fine, but Lord Moran had previously tested him with a dose of amphetamines to see if it had any adverse effects.  It did not.  So, Churchill was buoyed by another administration on the day of his speech, commenting to Moran, ""It was a great success. It cleared my head and gave me great confidence"".
So what might we conclude?  Watch the DVD tape and enjoy it as entertainment, and maybe have some fun finding other gaffs, but do not get overly wrought up about its inadequacies.  It is media hype, maybe not at its worst, but close.",1459728000,10,5740,4.896800825593395
7507732,5,B017KNPQVW,"In the summer of 1953 Churchill (Michael Gambon) suffered a stroke. With Anthony Eden (Alex Jennings) in the US having a gall bladder operation (outpatient surgery today) it was decided to hide his ailment from the press, the world , and the opposition party.  The film also looks at Millie Appleyard (Romola Garai) a fictional nurse who has headed to Australia with her fiance to ""put his dreams before mine.""  The dry martini family is called home and their bickering continue.

The performances were outstanding. The theme of the film was to show us how the dreams and aspirations of great people affect the lives of everyone around them. As stated, ""There is a price to pay for greatness, but the great seldom pay it."" We see the price his family had to pay, and ""the rock"" his wife had to be to stand by his side, realizing that it was all about him.

The fictional and slightly anachronistic nurse, a woman who [plot spoiler] follows her own dreams was placed there as an alternative to living your life for your own dreams instead of your spouse as Lady Churchill (Lindsay Duncan) gallantly did.",1458432000,11,1102,4.664948453608248
7507733,5,B017KNPQVW,"I enjoyed this very much. It was entertaining and I didn't want it to stop. I am currently 1/4 the way in to Clementine, which I love. Of the little I've read, this movie seems mostly accurate except for the nurse. I read a horrible article from the author explaining how she got her name in this story... The bottom line is-very much worth the money and Ramola Geary is great as the nurse. This was entertainment. If I want perfect history, I'll rent a documentary.",1514419200,,466,4.430232558139535
7507734,3,B017KNPQVW,"I was, initially, expecting to dislike this movie. Having 6' tall Michael Gambon portray 5'6"" Winston Churchill? I mean REALLY!! That would be like having Dwayne Johnson portray Danny DeVito! (This bit of miscasting cost the movie a ""star"" in my review.) However, shortly into the movie, the height/build disparity was soon overlooked. What Gambon DID do was capture the essence of Churchill. He embraced Churchill's temperament, foibles, strengths, weaknesses, and determination and made them his own. He ""became"" Churchill; albeit a six-foot tall version of him.

Overall, this movie was rather well done except for the part of his nurse. While the actress did a fine job, in actuality, Churchill had three nurses; not just one. It would have been great if we could have seen the interplay between all three nurses and Churchill as well as the relationship of the three nurses with each other and how Churchill related to each individual nurse. This single, fictionalized nurse cost the movie another ""star"" in my book. I just hate it when screenwriters interject a fictional character into a biographical/historical drama or play just for convenience and/or dramatic effect.

This movie does show an aspect of Churchill's life that many may not be aware. His stroke could have been a sad and pitiful end to the lion of World War II. Thank goodness that Churchill triumphed once again.",1509753600,,1387,5.078947368421052

7507764,5,B017KNPQVW,I love watching movies about Churchill and FDR.  Another viewer was so right when he said Gambon captured Churchill perfectly by not trying to sound exactly like him.  This was a touching movie and reminds us what he contributed to the British and all those wanting to overcome Hitler.  I don't know if it was truth or dinematic truth-bending about whether the nurse really did not take the boat to Australia but I hope it was true and Churchill had some part in instilling in her the hope that he still had for being true to his calling whatever the cost.,1489881600,,556,4.485148514851486

7507782,4,B017KNPQVW,"An odd film and really lacking in any sense of reality. Rather poorly produced, it tries to tell too many stories at the same time. Michael Gambon is the latest in a long line of actors playing Churchill and for me was not the best. His voice was especially wrong as was his whole persona. I actually had the honour of meeting him in the House of Commons about the time of this film (1953); I was a 16 year old boy taken by my father for a tour of parliament by our local MP. And there he was. Still a very active man with a presence that would fill a cathedral. If I compare that man with Gambon's portrayal, there is so much missing. Although the incident in the film is supposed to be based on fact this is really total fiction. His health at that time was deteriorating but on no occasion was he ever taken to Chartwell or attended by a single nurse which in itself would be very bad.
In an attempt to forge some sense of reality, the film introduces a whole raft of auxiliary characters dressed in identical suits who race down to Chartwell to express worrying thoughts about how the country will survive without Churchill. A little research would have told the script writers that by this stage Churchill was just a figure head and the story about him actually taking a cabinet meeting was blatant rot. If this was not enough, the film makes a fatuous attempt to introduce a sub-plot about Churchill's children fighting like dogs. It is so bad that I am surprised that the Churchill family did not veto it. Drunken behavior and Mr and Mrs Churchill sobbing over a lost child are the ultimate death of a poor film. The failure of Gambon to look remotely like Churchill (what happened to that short stout man) is only matched by the portrayal of his wife who seems to have stopped by at the wrong movie. I notice it is produced for PBS and so nothing much matters; anything will do for the Americans. Does the picture on the cover look anything Churchill?",1476748800,3,1959,4.3994490358126725

8739602,5,B017KNPQVW,"You don't have to be a history buff, or know anything about Winston Churchill or British history to enjoy this moving DVD.  Churchill is an aging Prime Minister.  He suffers a stroke, but must keep it a secret for political reasons.  With the help of a spunky young nurse, he struggles to recover.  His health is not helped by the presence of his three obnoxious, adult children.  I did some research after watching this movie, and indeed, his children really were as odious as they are depicted here.  The actors portraying Churchill, his wife, and the nurse are particularly good.",1519948800,,582,4.77
