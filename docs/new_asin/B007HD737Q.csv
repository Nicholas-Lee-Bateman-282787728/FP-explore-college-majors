8516656,5,B007HD737Q,"Mother's Day Evil is an unnerving indy horror, subtly laced with a slither of dark humour - much like early John Carpenter (the director; not the Disney travesty). Don't get this film if you are a rabid fan of SAW or any of the Hollyweird commercial franchise horrors. It's not an FX laden gore-fest (there is none) - it's far more than that. The director utterly understands and shrewdly embraces the genre to great effect.",1342742400,,424,4.666666666666667
