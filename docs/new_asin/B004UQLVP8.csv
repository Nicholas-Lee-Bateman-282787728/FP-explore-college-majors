We were not trying to introduce our children to the story as they have grown up on all the old stories including Ramayan and Mahabharat - but this was really a fresh take and only follows Arjun as far as the end of his exile in Virat.  Sri Krishna is shown only in a peripheral way - the story truly focuses on Arjun's inner development as a warrior and as someone learning about the dharm.

I cannot overstate how gorgeous the animation is.  The natural backgrounds are epic - like Lord of the Rings. The light and shadows are beautiful.

The music is also very good and sticks with you afterward.

The movie does well in glossing over some of the more difficult things to explain to children.  For example, nowhere is it made explicit that Draupadi is actually married to all five Pandavas. Her disrobing is also very much done carefully and is not explicit at all, so to be appropriate scene for all ages. Duryodhan's early attempt on Bheem's life is also left off camera. There is some blood in battle, but it is all very carefully done.  My boys were much inspired rather than frightened.  (Ages 5, 8, 10, and 13).

Do your family a favour and introduce them to this rare take on a heroic story if they do not already know it.  If they do know it (and I hope they do!), they will still find this a fresh and exciting, crisp-paced retelling.  Enjoy!",1353801600,2,1445,4.411320754716981

8442020,4,B004UQLVP8,"Animation in India does not have deep roots like it has in the USA. India is a late starter as far as Animation technique is concern but it is soon catching up. India started churning out animation movies after computer aided animation made easier. Year 2012 saw two full length films released in the theatres. The movie until now though were nice and the quality of animation acceptable they could not be called classic. Now here comes a classic. Produced by UTV in India, which has recently been taken over by Walt Disney studios, this is top notch world class 2D animation.

The movie is not specially directed to young children, but teenagers and adults who like animation films would enjoy it. The story if about a part of the full Mahabharata on which many TV serials have been made but this film deals only with the part when Arjun and his brothers are in exile.

What I liked most about the movie is the research they have done in the architecture and wardrobe which has not be glorified and is very what it must have been. The movie has a definite feel of its own and is a done in a mature style. Background and animation is realistic in nature. The movie is war oriented in the traditional manner and all actions are all very well done. The fundamental thing here is the research that was put in from all the view points. Even the action scenes are well researched.

For anyone interested in animation films this is a must watch, as this is world class animation and for anyone interested in Indian Animation this movie would be a mile stone. I saw the movie in its original language Hindi and the dialogues are fine but at times they are spoken in a manner that they are not audible. Indian have pointed noses but in this movie all the characters have noses which looked rather Greek than Indian, which is the only thing I did not like. Looks like it was carried forward from Dashavtara.",1341360000,2,1898,4.479768786127168
