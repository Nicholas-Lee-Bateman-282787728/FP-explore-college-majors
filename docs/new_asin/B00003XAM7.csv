7919610,4,B00003XAM7,"Although the script somewhat concerns discovering a method for controlling the aging process of humans, this low-budget film is most notable for top-flight satirical writing and exceptional acting. Heather Mitchell, a stage trained actress Down Under, is remarkable with her acutely accurate sense of comic syntactic timing. She, along with Geoffrey Rush, much lauded for his performance in ""Shine"", thoroughly enjoy creating their roles. Australian politics, hardly different from any other, are broadly pastiched. The director, Peter Duncan, also scripted and nicely plays a barrister. The plot is wildly improbable but each scene presents something of interest. This little known work deserves a wider audience than it has had.",1114646400,,730,5.706422018348624
7919611,5,B00003XAM7,"Great swing or ""soul"" music, you don't hear that often in movies now.  This is a hilarious, somewhat slap-stick, somewhat rude farce comedy. It is a romantic comedy also with revenge (more broad but less vicious though than War of the Roses). It is also agreat commentary on politicians.  Geoffrey Rush is superb.  Researchers working on the aging process try to get funding and run into Satanists! They use chickens to experiment on, one of the jokes is, he makes a typo on his report and puts ""Winding back the cluck."" If you aren't laughing, maybe you have to be there. It is set in Australia (bad politicians are worldwide evidently), but I didn't find any humor I couldn't relate to or understand.  It is an intelligent comedy that you have to pay attention to in order to get the ending which is great.",970963200,10,808,4.590277777777778
