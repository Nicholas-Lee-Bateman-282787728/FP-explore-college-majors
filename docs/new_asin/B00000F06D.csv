7906326,4,B00000F06D,"Gallagher's newest video, ""Smashing Cheeseheads"" is a mixed bag.
It is a different Gallagher, who is a bit more bitter and is certainly older.  And while he has always not been the most politically  correct, he seems to probably insult more groups of people in this film  than his others.
*BUT*, ""Smashing Cheeseheads"" does have some  great moments of comedy, and is entertaining throughout.  If you buy the  tape for the ""Sledge-O-Matic"" section, this isn't necessarily a  good tape.. It does have a smashing food part, but it is mostly just shots  of the food flying, and not all the patter and jokes in between.
The  setting for the show is a lower quality than his older shows.. Whereas he  used to have big props and backgrounds, this one is done just a normal  stage (at the Univerity of Wisconsin) and he has no big signs or props. He  does have some props with him, however, and some of them are pretty  clever.
His act consists of his usual elements, making fun of  ridiculousness and common sense, and jokes about the relationships between  men and women.
If you are a fan of Gallagher, it is worth a buy.  If you  are just a casual fan looking for one of his better tapes, this wouldnt be  the one to go for.",952041600,7,1219,4.463636363636364
7906327,2,B00000F06D,"If Gallagher could only realize that America fell in love with him for his cleanliness, his humorous stories about his daughter Amy, and his ability to tell it like it is.  We miss his one-of-a-kind inventions, his mockery  of the English language, and his hillarious props used on stage.
We are  now given a bitter old man with a chip on his shoulder that he can't seem  to shake. We are told he is the ""new"" Gallagher and that his  ""new"" jokes are suppose to be funny to us.  They're not. If I  wanted dirty and rude, there is an unlimited supply of comedians to choose  from.  If I want clean and fun, all that's left is Bill Cosby.
I'll miss  you Gallagher but I'll always have the memories of your past perfomances  and I will forever cherish them!",951696000,6,753,4.345323741007194
