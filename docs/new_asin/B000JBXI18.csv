8149616,5,B000JBXI18,"I give the Martyr DVS 5 stars because it's another great song from a clearly resurgent Depeche Mode. However, as someone who has followed Depeche Mode for 22 years, and who's favorite member used to be Alan Wilder (who left the band officially in 1995) this video is an annoyance. Not only was the intended video reported to have been pulled, but this collage video omits history. Yes, it's true as someone put to me the other day, Alan Wilder is no longer in Depeche Mode and he didn't participate on the song Martyr. I agree, but he was a member during the greatest period in the bands history, he shaped the sound of the band and, this single comes off a best of compilation. Thus, the video collage represents a look back for the band. To cut every single frame so Alan Wilder doesn't show up, to me feels pety and wrong.

Aside from anything else, it's not very cleverly done this, but again, it's a really nice song. If you only get one of the 3 versions on offer, get Pt. 1, the remix is really cool.",1162684800,,1007,4.328042328042328
