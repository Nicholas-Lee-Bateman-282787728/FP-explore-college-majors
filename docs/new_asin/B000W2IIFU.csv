It is not flashy and covers the proper material that needs covered for novices. Without a doubt many experienced karate-ka will also pickup some tips.

2961362,5,B000W2IIFU,"Richard Amos has truly succeeded in creating something very special with his Shotokan Mastery video series. Clear and concise, this video embodies the essence of traditional karate training. This first video in the series presents the basic, beginner level fundamentals of Shotokan Karate in a manner that makes it accessible for anyone. One could literally learn karate straight from this program. The production quality is top notch. Each technique is shown from various angles as Sensei Amos gives detailed explanations on proper form and muscle position. The subtle flute music that plays in the background throughout lends a very traditional Japanese feel to the program. I would highly recommend Shotokan Mastery to anyone who has ever had any interest in real karate training.

2961363,5,B000W2IIFU,"Finally, a DVD has arrived that marries impeccable karate technique, world-class instruction and professional production values. Frankly, this is the finest karate DVD that I've ever had the pleasure of viewing.

Richard Amos is a graduate of the famous JKA instructors' class and the chief instructor of the World Traditional Karate Organization. There is no denying that he is superbly qualified to teach traditional Shotokan karate and has a lineage that can be traced directly back to Funakoshi Sensei himself. Unsurprisingly, the karate in this DVD is of an incredibly high standard with Sensei Amos' personal style being powerful and dynamic while, at least to my eyes, a little more fluid than that of many other instructors.

This DVD covers kihon, kumite and kata - subjects that are covered in many other videos - but it's the quality of instruction that raises this DVD head-and-shoulder above all others as the depth and detail is outstanding. While the techniques covered are first taught to beginners, the commentary provided by Sensei Amos will be illuminating for much more experienced karateka - this DVD is absolutely packed full of details that will help advanced karate practioners refine their technique. For example, in the basics section, Sensei Amos indicates that one should pivot on the ball of the foot when moving forward and on the heel when moving backwards. This simple statement is likely to consume my own personal training sessions for the foreseeable future.

It's also worth mentioning that the production quality on this DVD is superb - the camera-work, lighting, sound and packaging are of the highest standard, making a welcome change from the many poorly shot and amateurishly produced karate videos sold today.

In my opinion, worth the price of this DVD alone is the performance of Suishu that plays under the closing credits - this beautifully fluid kata was devised by Asai Sensei and is rarely taught in most Shotokan schools. Here, Sensei Amos' performance lends the kata a palpable sense of menace.

I believe that this DVD will make a wonderful addition to any karateka's library of instructional material and will provide a rich source of inspiration to karate students of all levels.",1194566400,5,2233,5.123626373626373

2961365,5,B000W2IIFU,"SHOTOKAN MASTERY by Sensei Richard Amos is a superb introduction to the art of Shotokan Karate. I found it to be excellent in every regard for both beginning and more advanced practitioners. The kihon,or fundamentals, are the essential component of true mastery of the art, and Amos demonstrates them with great precision, grace and power, reminiscent of the truly great karate masters. His explanations of the subtleties are articulate and accurate, and his understanding of the details of biomechanics is clearly evident. The cinematography, voiceover, music and production quality are all first class. The simple and minimal setting truly exemplified a traditional dojo, and was beautifully shot. Moreover, Sensei Amos displays the humility characteristic of a true karateka. This is definitely one of the best instructional presentations I have seen in many years. I highly recommend it to all karateka, regardless of style ...

8221089,5,B000W2IIFU,"Sensei Ramos will make your karate more deadly and your mechanics are quickly corrected if they need it just by following his simple and well spoken instructions. A great supplement to the dojo when training at home. I'm 20 years in, 2nd Dan FSKA, I have seen a lot of dojos and practitioners, this video us worth the money and time.",1498089600,,333,4.475409836065574
8221090,5,B000W2IIFU,"Ok so I was somewhat skeptical of the video.  As the nature of dvd's your not going to be perfect on these alone.  But as a supplemental tool to your training.  This dvd is the one of the best kinds I've seen.  It's very clear and informative, I didn't feel confused.  I'll be using it to ensure my techniques stay clean and are done the way they should be done, espcially during my spells away from the class due to school and basicly any of lifes time consuming challenges.

Conclusion:  If you would like some extra instruction on being sure your doing things correctly and your serious about your practice, you can't go wrong with this one.",1255219200,,644,4.452991452991453

8221092,5,B000W2IIFU,"One would expect that viewing a DVD with title ""Volume One: 9th-8th kyu (white belt)"" would have an instructor with 25+ years of Shotokan experience fast-forwarding through most of it before passing it onto his students. On the contrary...I watched every second of this one and had to hit the rewind button several times to make sure I caught some of the details that were explained in such detail, yet with refreshing clarity. This DVD was very professionally put together and not only were the physical examples of the highest quality but the accompanying narrative was full of useful information, even for those with much experience.  This is the first in a series of instructional DVDs, progressing from white- to black-belt and each one has things that beginners and advanced instructors alike will find useful.  If you do Shotokan, you should seriously consider purchasing a copy.

8221094,5,B000W2IIFU,"I have a wide selection of books and dvds on karate technique.  I cannot recommend this DVD by Richard Amos more.  It's clear, concise, and provides the beginner as well as the advance practitioner with great insight into the mechanics of shotokan karate.  Even if you train in another style this is the DVD to own if you want to know more about Shotokan. Plus, knowing more about other styles helps you understand the style you practice with greater depth.",1226534400,2,457,4.6875
8221095,5,B000W2IIFU,"I have been using martial arts dvds in other arts for over 15 years now. As I am new to Shotokan, I wanted to see what videos were available and Shotokan Mastery is the first DVD that I decided to purchase. The content is spot on with what I'm doing, and it is very helpful to me in training. What really impresses me is the amount of work that must have gone into such a production as this. It is a work of art in itself! I've never seen a martial arts instructional dvd like it and I look forward to more in the future!",1223510400,,521,3.9714285714285715
8221096,5,B000W2IIFU,"This DVD is fantastic. It is obvious that Sensei Amos has put considerable thought and perfectionist effort to produce this DVD. Sensei Amos is a graduate of the famous and prestigious JKA instructor's course which says it all!

This DVD shows his technical understanding of Karate. Though I thought after a few years of Shotokan under a few excellent instructors in different parts of the world I had understood most of the basic 9th/8th Kyu stuff, I must admit that this DVD showed me that there where quite a few subtle points I had missed or not really understood.

And this is exactly what I really like about this DVD: Sensei Amos does not keep his knowledge to himself, but is willing to share his technical expertise. Since it contains a wealth of information in a dense form, I have to rewind this DVD back a lot and watch some of the parts over and over again to really get some of the points, but this is not a bad thing, is it?

I have to finish with an open question: Sensei Amos, when will you produce the second volume of this series ? I know several Shotokan practitioners who are waiting for it!!",1198800000,2,1113,4.446078431372549

This dvd is for anyone that wants to improve their understanding of karate. Buy it.",1196553600,2,358,4.358208955223881
