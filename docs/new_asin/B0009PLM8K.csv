8064890,3,B0009PLM8K,"What's good: An ongoing admixture of magic into what would otherwise have been an ordinary, even hazardous quotidian existence. Transitions are smooth and dreamy, but generally carry enough context to tie the two plot-worlds together.

What's not: Un-dramatic plotting, despite some potentially moving plot elements. Lack of explanation (not that I demand all that much, usually) and faiilure to pull all the elements together into a meaningful whole.

Good enough, I'll watch again to see if I can pull more out of it, but it might not be a permanent citizen in my collection.

8064891,2,B0009PLM8K,"Like art-house movies, I have a love/hate relationship with anime. Sometimes I'm treated to a magical Miyazaki film, a quaint comedy like ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"", or an excellent romance like ""5 Centimeters Per Second."" Other times, however, I'm forced to sit through boring tripe like ""Serial Experiments Lain"" or ""Grave of the Fireflies."" I'm disappointed to report that ""My Beautiful Girl Mari"" safely rests within the latter category.

The big problem with this movie is that there's no development for any of the characters and all of the relationships are wafer thin. You barely get to see the boy spend time with his family, which is allegedly the primary cause for his discontent with his personal life. It might have been a good idea to spend a little more time within the household so the viewer gets a better understanding of why this kid is so depressed all the time. And what's with that girl at his school? Did she serve any purpose whatsoever in this movie?

It's no understatement to say that 90% of the running time is dedicated to showing the kid and his friend doing all sorts of dull activities like sleeping, walking around an old lighthouse, and other trivialities. Some of the swimming scenes were good, but that's about it. I don't know about you, but when I was a kid I would actually have fun when spending time with my friends, and a lot of the games we invented could easily fill a number of movies. A child's imagination is quite impressive when attempting to find something fun to do. It's too bad the filmmakers here were content with unimaginative wandering and dull-as-dirt filler material.

But I still haven't even gotten to the worst part of this movie. And let me tell you, it's a definitive black eye to the filmmakers of ""My Beautiful Girl Mari."" What is it? Quite frankly, there is virtually no time spent in the fantasy realm with Mari. This completely cripples the entire premise of the movie, and one scene in particular makes this perfectly clear. At the 50-minute mark the kid worries about how ""all of this might end"" even though he had literally spent less than 2 MINUTES with the girl throughout the ENTIRE FILM! That, my friends, is HORRIBLE relationship development.

Don't believe me? Try this. Imagine that you're on a first date. You meet this person at a restaurant, introduce yourself, and then sit at the table. While waiting for the server to bring you your drinks you say, ""Gee sweety, I don't know how I'd live without you."" Rest assured that you'll never get a second date.

It's really a shame, because the animation in this film is gorgeous at times, but the whole project falls in on itself with an uninspired script. Did the filmmakers not know that the premise they're attempting to sell is the conflict between reality and fantasy? Don't you think it would be a good idea to fully develop the difficulties of reality and fully develop the comforts of fantasy? Neither of which is given enough attention here. What we end up with is lots and lots of dull filler. Why do some filmmakers feel the need to make anime films as bland as humanly possible? It's no exaggeration to say that the title of the film should be changed from ""My Beautiful Girl Mari"" to ""My Boring Life.""",1219190400,4,3248,4.671328671328672
8064892,3,B0009PLM8K,"the story was lacking. its ok to be imaginative and show what its like to be a kid, but if that exceeds, then it gets vague. and thats what i felt. also, it didn't seem like there was any difference from the main characters younger age and his older self, it left me viewing him as a mental patient. the graphics are pretty, the music was beautiful, and that last song reminded me of ""neverending story"".",1127174400,,404,4.328947368421052
8064893,2,B0009PLM8K,"I have to say I was taken in by the packaging of this film while browsing the anime section in a DVD store.  I was originally out to find some good anime for my daughter that wasn't to violent or nasty.  This film did satisfy those criteria but never brings a suitable plot to light.

In the film Nam-woo is coming of age and about to make changes in his life.  He is about to start a new school, and his mom is begining to date a new guy since his father died.  Then he stumbles into a fantasy world where everything is like a fairytale. He meets Mari there and she talks to him in his head.  While there he sees a calm relaxing world that he enjoys escaping to, but never really interacts with.  By the end of the film he loses touch with his fantasy world, and moves on with his life.

Well the film really did have potential, but the way it was executed made it seem like it was dragging the viewer along to a climax that never comes.  For one, Nam-woo keeps going back and forth to the fantasy world, but dosen't do anything there.  No adventure, no conflict, hardly any interaction with Mari.  In his real world he always withdraws from people, so we never get to see any real human interaction either.  I think the main problem I was having with the film was the lack of a clear direction.  It should have focused on the fantasy world and put Nam-woo there for most of the film, or at least zeroed in on his friends at school and the conflicts and situations they were having. There was one female character who could have provided a decent plot for Nam-woo and his friend, but the director never shows us that path.  It wasn't just me having a hard time getting into the film.  My daughter lost intrest in it too, which makes it a poor choice for a child's film also.

As far as the tech aspects go, ADV is the release company.  The disc has the origianl Korean along with an English dubbed language soundtrack.  It is also in widescreen.

I could only give the film 2 stars for the animation style which was good(discounting the characters who wern't animated very intrestingly) and the fantasy world for the ideas and creativity there.

Overall I'd say this a rental film only.  It dosn't have much replay value to it, and in my book good animation is only half the battle in making an animated classic.  Story is the other half, and when you have animated classics out there like Spirited Away, Grave of the Fire Flies, and Castle in the Sky, you can't skimp on the story.  There are just to many better choices for viewing out there.  This is a good prototype film for animation style, now we need the story to get up to par. Definately try to rent before buying. And if a parent buying, try to look for something with a quicker pace that will intrest your son or daughter.",1125878400,15,2785,4.301343570057582
8064894,5,B0009PLM8K,"It's a real treat whenever you come across a movie like it. As a love fantasy from South Korea, My Beautiful Girl Mari takes a simple story and combines it with unique animation. And the results are amazing. In a small town that resides by the sea, two friends learn the meaning of friendship as they grow up while occasionally whisking away into a dream-like world inhabited by a mysterious girl. At the same time, the notion of fantasy and reality becomes all the less clearer.

This is a movie that knows how to take its time. Unlike a lot of fast-oriented and action-filled animated movies out there, this one is very calm and smooth throughout, which is quite fitting for a story of its type. The animation itself is charming on its own that you might find yourself admiring the sceneries or how the characters move most of the time. Everything from the sharp yet faded colors to the abstract detail of the town is impressive. The soundtrack itself also lends a welcome hand to the overall experience.

In a world where animation is often becoming more and more reserved for the squeamishly childish or in some cases the violent-minded, My Beautiful Girl Mari is a nice change of pace to see an animated film that shows no tensions and just allows the viewer to relax while watching it. A surreal though substantial work, there's really nothing else like it.",1125187200,14,1363,4.651452282157677
