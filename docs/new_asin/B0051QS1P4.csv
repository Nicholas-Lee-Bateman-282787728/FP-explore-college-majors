4525809,4,B0051QS1P4,"Great series and it's nice to have it on DVD.  I would quibble that I'm partly sure the episodes on these discs are ""syndication edits"" as at least one of the episodes on this set I remember seeing when it first aired and part seems to be missing.  But, anyway, still a great series.",1314835200,12,283,4.222222222222222

4525816,5,B0051QS1P4,Chilling set. Some truly sad cases here but if you're not turned off by pure evil in the world it's extremely interesting how these scumbags are eventually caught. I remember seeing some of these eps for the first time and they've stuck with me. The show was one of the best produced crime shows ever. From the interviews to the reenactment clips and how the show flowed leaving you with bits of clues as the story progressed as they reached the killers. It's no wonder reruns are leading syndcation on HLN at the moment.,1445299200,2,521,4.553191489361702

4525828,5,B0051QS1P4,All good current murder mysteries; made even better by the acclaimed voice of narrator Peter Thomas.  (He was also recently featured on a PBS venture).  Just good who-done-its..until the very end when the killer or killers are uncovered using the facinating field of forensics.  Lots of good rainy day viewing.,1406419200,2,310,5.16

4525834,3,B0051QS1P4,I was looking forward to getting this and was pleasantly surprised when I got it. there is so much intracal things to forensic technology that I didn't even know about. I want to see the other ones so I may purchase them.,1372723200,,221,4.285714285714286
4525835,3,B0051QS1P4,pretty much just watched them all in the same night.  I guess I should have tried to stretch them out so that they would have lasted a bit longer.,1370649600,,146,4.0344827586206895

Sip of Sins and Knot For Everyone.  I love forensic files.  I started watching Forensic Files on Court Tv when Forensic Files first premiered.  Forensic Files is my favorite true crime show.  I love Peter Thomas' voice.
Forensic files is innovative and on the cutting edge of Forensic Science.  I give this collection a five star rating and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the world of forensics.",1366416000,,525,4.920454545454546

I enjoyed the couple of episodes I'd never seen air on tv and even the ones I'd seen before I enjoyed as well. 12 great episodes worth the money.,1355270400,,316,4.112903225806452
4525848,4,B0051QS1P4,"Forensic Files is an American documentary-style series which reveals how forensic science is used to solve violent crimes, mysterious accidents, and even outbreaks of illness. The show takes a ""whodunit"" approach, making each case a mystery to be solved. Every 22 minutes episode follows one case from initial investigation until conviction, acquittal, or some other legal resolution. Pathologists, medical examiners, police officers, detectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys, friends and families of victims or sometimes even the suspects themselves are all interviewed about their roles.

This set is about Serial Killers. All 12 investigations are very interesting. Here are the 12 episodes you'll find on this set:

1. Calculated Coincidence: The suspect in a woman's rape and strangulation is linked to a six year old murder case of an exotic dancer in another state. Could investigators catch the killer?
2. The Commom Thread: In 1984, a Florida serial killer was preying on woman. Red fibers were found on the victims' bodies, but a survivor provided information that would result in the capture of the perpetrator.
3. Insignificant Others: As investigators explore details of the apparent suicide of a dentist's wife, another suice 14 years earlier lead investigators to look more closely at the possibility of a double homicide.
4. Knot for Everyone: In the mid-1980s, bodies of nude woman were found in remote hill of California. The police got a brake when a known prostitute escaped an attacker and was able to identify him and his automobile.
5. Penchant for Poison: One elderly woman with arsenic poisoning leads police to possible many victims. The only way to tell is to exume their bodies.
6. Screen Pass: A young girl is abducted from her home while babysitting and eventually found murdered. Fingerprints left on a screen lead investigators to uncover the work of a seriel killer.
7. Sign of the Zodiac: For six years, a serial killer prowled the streets of New York City, hunting his victims. He promised to kill 12 people, one for each astrological sign. And he only struck while certain constellations were visible. It took forensic astronomy, handwriting analysis, and a World War II code breaker to find him
8. Sip of Sins: The Faryion Wardrip Serial Murder Case, where a sunday School Teacher, a valued employee with a happy family homelife, secretly fooled the police as being a serial killer.
9. Southside Strangler: The case of Timothy Spencer is related. Dubbed the Southside Strangler, he was the first serial killer convicted on DNA evidence. During a three-month span during 1987, he raped and murdered three women in Richmond.
10. Ties that Bind: A piece of rope holds the key to identifying a serial killer who has been preying on boys in Maine and Nebraska.
11. Touch of Evil: The ""Last Call Killer"" targeted men in gay bars who drank heavily.  After killing and dismembering them, he carefully washed away the evidence.  He eluded capture for almost ten years, until new technology revealed fingerprints no one knew were there.
12. Treads and Threads: An overview of the James Randall case. For 15 months in Florida, the alleged serial killer preyed on women, taunting police by leaving his victims' bodies in plain sight. The muddy imprint left by his truck, which used rare tires, eventually led investigators to him.",1352160000,27,3357,5.109289617486339

4525850,4,B0051QS1P4,"Love stuff about Serial Killers. Just got my DVD in the mail. I have only one problem, though. While the titles of each episode are given, no other info pertaining to the case is summed up. I would like to know WHO the serial killer is, and maybe a brief bio about them before I decided which episode I'd like to watch. Call me a control freak, but I like to be prepared rather than suprised when I sit down to watch something. Maybe this is a minor flaw, but all the same, a little more info on each episide would have been nice.",1350432000,,530,4.105769230769231
