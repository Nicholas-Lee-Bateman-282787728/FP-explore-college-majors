8589920,5,B00D6I7IW6,"I am new to Ween, which is very long after their peak. However, for any other new fans who wish to find one release to start off with, this is it. I listened to a countless number of songs and watched videos on You Tube before deciding upon this one. Since I was never a freeloader, I ordered my own copy through Amazon. As icing on my cake, it also came with a CD with most of the songs from this ultimate set list. Watch the whole thing on You Tube and then don't be a lowly cheap skate. As for musical styles, this group is all over the map. As for twisted humor, be prepared for lots of it!",1504828800,,594,3.9583333333333335

8589923,2,B00D6I7IW6,"Thr third time I purchased  this fine show. This one is a descent bootleg, i am dissapointed to say. ....I don't have surrond sound, so I can't claim any review there. But grainy footage and the  odd slim band on the side screen implies  a copy. Still comes with cd, for a reasonable  price. I enjoyed it w my humidifier  blasting next to tv to emphasize  the fog....
