4684894,3,B005FQZMKM,"I was around in the early 70's when Christian Rock started (Paul Clark) and when non Christian Rock groups began singing Christian lyrics (Byrds: Jesus is Just Alright with Me).  I'm older.  I listen to Bach and Beethoven and Mozart most of the time.
The subject of this DVD - the universe and its Creator, i.e. cosmology from a Christian perspective - is a wonderful one with very little done in DVD.  So I am grateful for the subject matter here but find the music (""symphony"" is not a good word to use for the music on this DVD) way below the level of the subject matter.  Rock is elemental emotions.  There is nothing wrong with that.  God made us with elemental emotions.  But there is much more to life than that too.  Notice I am not commenting on the Pastor who appears very devout and passionate.
For the universe and God in cosmology I like the DVD series on Intelligent Design available on Amazon.  I have seen some pretty good dvd's from Moody Science films on this subject also which I was able to stream from Netflix.  Frankly as I said above, this is an area that could use some work.",1357344000,2,1099,4.396039603960396

4684908,5,B005FQZMKM,"Louie Giglio hits it out of the park with this one video message of the mysteries
of the creations of the depths of the Universe.  God created something so vast
and so endless and so full of wonder and amazement, most men's minds cannot
truly understand it.  But, Louie Giglio delivers some amazing evidence based
in Scripture and proof through science that God is Great!!!!  I highly recommend
this dvd for any person, regardless of faith or belief.  It is fantastic!",1355702400,,468,4.7407407407407405

4684912,5,B005FQZMKM,I loved the video. I had seen Louie teach this when I went to the Chris Tomlin concert. I was glad they put it on video for purchase.,1344297600,,133,3.7857142857142856
4684913,1,B005FQZMKM,"I ordered and returned this item twice.  Both times it would not play in any CD player.
I was never able to hear, and therefore, comment on the quality of the actual music.",1340409600,,172,4.212121212121212

4684915,5,B005FQZMKM,"Louie Giglio is the type of Pastor you wish you had in your hometown. He combines a great talent for story telling that just absorbs the listener.

8470542,5,B005FQZMKM,"As always, Louie's presentations knock it out of the park. Who would have thought of combining the sounds of outer space with the whales and sounds of nature to hear them sing praises to our great Creator?",1486684800,2,205,4.5675675675675675
