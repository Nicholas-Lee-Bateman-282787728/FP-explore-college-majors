2257750,4,B0008ENI0W,"This film will probably only please sci-fi fans, and that only if they're willing to put up with the many inconsistencies Immortal has to offer.  The dialogue is awkward, sometimes nonsensical; the only native English speaker in the small cast of real actors is Rampling, and even some of her lines seem stilted and unnatural.  The rest of the cast are CGI characters, and that is obvious from the stiff movements and inability of their lips to keep up with the dialogue.  The plot is not fleshed out fully, and at the end of the movie there are a lot of unexplained loose ends.

OK, so having said all that, I gave Immortal 4 stars out of 5.  Why?  The film has an almost magical, hypnotic effect (at least on me).  The background shots of New York in 2095 are wonderful, and the CGI characters are very well done (if not quite perfect).  The unnatural dialogue and obviously CGI characters lend an artistic and dream-like quality to the film; in other words, even the film's inadequacies contribute to its overall other-wordliness.  It's a haunting vision of a bizarre future, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it (several times).

One complaint I have about this release is this:  while the film has been released in English, there are several places where two different languages are spoken, but with no English subtitles.  There are several exchanges between the various Egyptian gods, apparently in some ancient Egyptian language (?), and having seen the film originally on TPS Star, I remember French subtitles were provided.  Not so on this DVD. As a result, we miss dialogue between the gods (and between Horus and the Dayak) that is relevant to the plot -- all we hear is gibberish. Also, at the end, Jill quotes Baudelaire in French, with no subtitles for those us not fluent en francais.  Nikopol also quotes Baudelaire, but has the courtesy to do it in English translation.  This is my main beef with this DVD.  Otherwise, it's a beautiful and ambitious movie if you're able to look past its deficiencies.",1120953600,3,2018,4.755747126436781
2257751,2,B0008ENI0W,"Immortal is a artsy sci-fi film set in a gray over-industialized-Cyber-Punk-like future. The graphics are an interesting mix of live-action and CGI- some of which works and some of which doesn't.

Jill is a weird blue mutant, who wears black latex and cries blue tears. Nikopol is an escaped ex-con. When Nikopol is possessed by the God Horus, the randy god he must have a mate, and that mate is Jill. Horus then proceeds to rape Jill. Several times. Bleh.

I got the impression the film makers were trying to be too 'artsy' with this film, that I ended up being alienated. I also wasn't too attached to Nikopol or Jill and couldn've done without the rape scenes. 2 stars.",1120348800,4,672,4.591666666666667
2257752,5,B0008ENI0W,"WOW! I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Till I watched this I new nothing of Enki's work. I was hesitant, thinking this might be some half-wit type take-off on ""Star Gate"". It's nothing of the sort -- a truely creative montage of of his own ideas, history, the creative milue of the present and the past.

Some other reviews I notice, are less than appreciative. Watch the film. If you don't get it, give yourself a few years to broaden your background in history, the visual arts, sci-fi, and liturature; then come back to the film. You will be pleasantly surprised.

This film IS ART . . . and well crafted.",1120176000,2,627,4.443478260869565
2257753,2,B0008ENI0W,"I purchased this DVD based on some trailers I'd seen last year around the time Casshern was released in Japan. The latest work of Enki Bilal, renowned graphic novelist, the film has some very interesting concepts, a striking use of color and an apparent total lack of budget...

The film takes place in the New York of tomorrow. The actual vision of the city is compelling, the execution is cheap with poorly rendered effects that simply do not convince...ever.

These short comings are made more obvious by a mixed cast of real actors and CG characters. The CG characters are laughably low resolution and animated so poorly, it is questionable if these animators were learning on the job. The level of articulation in the actual meshes for the 3D stuff is not even up to modern video game standards.

What is most odd, is that the majority of the CG characters are just odd looking humans. I have no idea why they didn't just hire actors and dress them up for the shots as needed?

The story, acting and script, while trying to be hard and serious, are dead and without feeling. The film was created in English by a non-native English speaker, so the use of slang feels forced and the craft of the lines is...well rather sophmore :(

Blade Runner this is not.

And sadly that is what this feels like it was going for. A more surreal Blade Runner meets the Fifth Element. It gets close to neither.",1120089600,2,1397,4.5458167330677295
2257754,3,B0008ENI0W,"I bought this DVD on blind faith, based on trailers I had seen and on the cover art.  I'm a big SCI-FI fan and also enjoy ancient Egyptian history.  I thought, ""How can I go wrong?"".  Although there are some great visuals and plenty of eye candy, the movie suffers from an incoherent plot and bad direction.  There are several interesting concepts and ideas that are introduced but are never fully explored or developed.  An Egyptian God, Horus is on a mission to impregnate a blue haired woman.  But there is no explanation of what his motives are for doing this.  The blue haired woman named Jill has amnesia and doesn't remember much or seem to have any goals or motives.  Although I suppose she is the main character and is pretty to look at, I ultimately found her uninteresting because she doesn't do much.  Nikopol played by Thomas Kretschmann seemed to have a more interesting background as it is said he is the one that caused the war and chaos on the planet and was then cryogenically frozen as punishment.  He has some funny interactions with Horus, but they never explain his back story or expand on his character either.  He basically becomes a puppet of Horus in order to have intercourse with Jill.  When they finally do have sex, they do it under a blanket, so there is not even any gratuitous nudity.  There is a subplot about body tissue and cosmetic surgery with people that look like characters from Star Trek Insurrection, but that is never explained.  Bizarre things happen in this movie such as Jill going into some tunnel that looks like outer space to talk with a man covered in black Arabian style cloths.  The main character Nikopol appears with two metal dome things on his head that were not there in the previous shot and which continue to be there for the rest of the film.  People enter some dimensional riff that just exists in the middle of nowhere and that people fall into, but is not explained.  It all gets very muddy and you keep watching hoping it will be one of the cool movies where all the pieces of the puzzle will come together and make sense at the end of the film.  However, the director fails to tie all the ideas together or give any sense of purpose or resolution to the story.  At the end of the movie, I found myself thinking, ""Is that it?"".  The other problem is that I think CGI should be used for backgrounds, cityscapes, etc. but not to replace real actors.  This movie was chock full of Final Fantasy type CGI characters that looked kind of tacky and their lips were out of sync with the dialog.  Even Horus looks like he is carved out of stone.  I think his character would have looked better if it was a bodybuilder with a bird mask or something.  I watched the bonus features and so I know it took them several years to make this film and that it was hard work doing all the computer graphics, so I do not want to criticize it too much.  I think the potential is there to a make a sequel and if it had a stronger story and used more real actors, it would be a stronger follow up.  But I'd say this is a rental and not something to pay $22 for.",1119571200,8,3103,4.362369337979094
2257755,4,B0008ENI0W,"Let me tell you about the director first.  Enki Bilal, born in Yugoslavia, moved to France when he was 10, and has become one of the most influential comic book artist in France since around 1980.  His works include 'Nikopol Trilogy,' and this French film 'Immortal' (his third entry as film director) is based on the first two books of the series.

I said this because the merit of 'Immortal' lies all in its visual imaginations.  The film's story with many characters is very confusing, revealing its origin.  The film is visually interesting for it was shot against the background of green-colored screen, on which the buildings or the landscapes of the city is digitally painted.  The method is similar to that of 'Sky Captain', but the effects are quite different as I explain later.

[THE STORY] is complicated, and the film refuses to explain some part of it.  'Immortal' is set in the year of 2095, NEw York City, where cars are flying between the skyscrapers, but one strange thing is floating on the air -- that's a pyramid, out of which a naked man with a bird's head emerges.  His name is Horus, a convicted deity who is given seven days to do something on Earth, borrowing the body of a convicted human Nikopol.

The nature of the crime of Nikopol (played by Thomas Kretschmann, 'The Pianist') is only vaguely suggested, but anyway Horus possesses his body, and controls him as he wishes.  Then, his purpose will be clear when Nikopol/Horus approaches to a mysterious woman Jill (former Miss France Linda Hardy), whose skin is all white and whose blood is blue.

Kretschmann, Hardy, and Charlotte Rampling (as Jill's doctor) appear as live-action actors while most of the other characters are created with CGIs by a French studio.  The CGI-created characters look like those you have seen in the film version of 'Final Fantasy' and in this sense 'Immortal' is more ambitious than 'Sky Captain.' Interesting thing is one of the CGI characters (Rampling's estranged husband) is played by uncredited Jean-Louis Trintignant (voice only) who had appeared Enki Bilal's first film 'Bunker Palace Htel.'

[VISUALS] I like the visual imagination of 'Immortal,' but many fans would point out, quite rightly, that the future world  of 'Immortal,' impressive as it is on its own way, are not as original as it looks.  You remember classic 'Blade Runner' 'The Fifth Element' and one Japanese genius Otomo.  To be fair, as I wrote before, Enki Bilal's original comics predate them (the first Nikopol comic was published in 1980), but still complaints are understandable.

But if the film is flawed (and I think it is), that is because of the visual itself, I mean, the CGI parts.  To be honest, the CGI-drawn characters (of a greedy senator, a detective, a big company executive, etc.) are all poorly done, and their bodily or facial movements are unnatural and awkward.  I am really afraid that they are giving serious damages to the whole film.

But as you will see, the talent of Enki Bilal is undeniable, and his vision is presented effectively with the other-worldly but retrospective descritions of the city of New York in 2095, which is beautifully drawn with blue and grey (red is seldom seen).  Far from perfect, but the picture is worth seeing.",1119398400,141,3253,4.844484629294756
2257756,4,B0008ENI0W,"One of the things we as Westerners must realize is how spoiled we are as film-goers in the sense that we expect the best production values. ""Immortal"", a French-made film based on a very cerebral comic book by Enki Bilal, forces that realization on us by presenting a beautifully made film with deliberately(?) dated CGI effects. The main characters, not including the god, Horus, are all full-flesh actors while supporting charcaters are computor generated, these particular effects predating ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" by at least two years. As Western viewers this might seem like a short-coming for a film released in 2004, but this supposed short-coming only adds to the poignancy and distinctiveness of ""Immortal"".

I will not provide a plot summary. The film's story is grand and heavy just as true science fiction was meant to be. French actress, Linda Hardy and Russian actor, Thomas Kretschmann are more than capable of embodying thier characters. And veteran English actress, Charlotte Rampling (Swimming Pool) adds a sense of class as a curious doctor of genetics. This film is a unique piece of art done in a style not seen by most film-goers. ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" is brought to mind for many, but not all, of the scenes are done in front of a green screen. For those of you who enjoyed ""Bladerunner"", ""Existenz"" and any stylized sci-fi of more recent years, ""Immortal"" will not disappoint in its very unique approach to concise and thought-provoking storytelling. Gorgeous film!",1119225600,2,1520,5.055776892430279
2257757,5,B0008ENI0W,"Try to see it in a theatre -- art houses should show this brilliant film. It's definitely worth seeing more than once. You should also check out books by Enki Bilal, particularly the Nikopol Trilogy from which this movie is loosely based.

I wanted to see this movie so much that I nearly flew to France when it was released there in March 2004. Instead I bought a regionless player so I could watch the Russian-subtitled version.

Enki Bilal's post-war apocalyptic graphic novels are layered with all kinds of emotion. He brings the same introspective theme to this film.

Thomas Kretschmann is an excellent actor to play Nikopol. Charlotte Rampling has a small but important role as the doctor. The CG characters are bizarre, scary and nothing like you've ever seen on screen.

Immortal's music score is also incredible; imbedded in my memory for weeks after seeing this movie.

I hope the Immortal DVD sales will renew interest in Enki Bilal's out-of-print previous two films, Tykho Moon and Bunker Palace Hotel.",1116028800,5,1015,4.912280701754386
2257758,4,B0008ENI0W,"When I sat down to watch the ""Immortal"" screener that I had gotten at my video-store job, I thought, ""Looks sweet."" It pulled me in right away. The world that I was watching reminded me of ""Tron""-meets-""5th Element""-meets-""Ghost in the Shell"" with a little bit of ""Stargate"" thrown in for balance. Then I was knocked out of the film by some old-school (I mean like 1998 PC graphics!) animation for some of the characters. But slowly I began to sucked back in because the whole damn flick was so...cool. Original does not even begin to cover it.

One can look at each frame as an individual artwork! It is compelling in that respect. A visual triumph for this fine French film! The soundtrack is good, but may be a bit too ambient for some, suggesting that a stronger musical...perhaps electronic soundtrack, might have been infused to imbue a more cohesive, and dynamic overall experience. None-the-less, this is a terrific sci-fi adventure unlike any other.

2257774,4,B0008ENI0W,"'Immortal' is a very ambitious film using a combination of animation and real actors to bring the story to life. It must have been a big gamble for the filmmakers to attempt such a feat and I think it works reasonably well. But reasonably well probably wasn't good enough to make this a blockbuster.

The story is a bit strange - ancient gods appear in a pyramid over New York in 2095. The god Horus has one week on Earth to preserve his immortality and the movie spends the balance of the 102 minutes following his journey. One problem (and there are many) is that it's never explained why the gods have arrived and why Horus has been placed on 7 days notice. While I guess this is not a deal-breaker, the film then explores the much-changed Earth but also doesn't explain how it has changed so much with aliens and a strange corporation called Eugenics that seems to run everything. The story is just so big there wasn't enough time to explain everything properly (or at all....).

The special effects are impressive in scale but less so in execution (very dated now but this film was made in the early 2000s). I have to respect the filmmakers for their vision. Unfortunately the Blu-ray picture quality isn't the best and very soft most of the time. But the audio is great with a Dolby Tru-HD 5.1 soundtrack.

In the end it was an interesting experience watching this film but there are just too many issues to elevate the production above 'good'.",1472256000,2,1450,4.547892720306513

It is sad is all I can say around the end of it. But in a happy way too. Like I said I won't spoil this. It is a must watch movie in my opinion. I watched the move 1984 by George Orwell. That use to be my favorite movie till I came across this one one day.

Without spoiling any of the movie I do want to tell everyone that this movie is a hybrid movie. It is part animation ""PEOPLE"" and real people. In some parts of the movie I could not even tell the person was an animated character unless I looked really closely.

The story of a ""god"" (Horus) who has been given a limited time to have sex with some woman (Jill) who have some ""power"" to have sex with a ""god."" Horus was having problems with taking over humans' bodies (in order to have sex with her) because of some ""genetic alterations."" So, he found Nikopol whose body has avoided the ""genetic alterations"" and he was able to take over his body partly. Sounds like a sci-fi version of a spirit possession and all that.

Directed by artist Enki Bilal (and based on his graphic novel ""La Foire aux immortels""), this is an atmospheric movie crammed with weird random plot elements and bad special effects. Maybe you have to read the graphic novel for it to make sense.

A strange pyramid has appeared over a dystopian New York City, and the ancient gods of Egypt have condemned the god Horus to die in seven days. In those seven days, he must go forth and father a child. Unfortunately any hosts he possess explode, until he finds a cryogenically frozen rebel named Nikopol (Thomas Kretschmann), who is the only one who can carry a god.

And the only woman whom Horus can knock up is Jill (Linda Hardy), a strange girl with blue scaly hair, blue tears and no memory. Unfortunately, the reigning politician of the city is determined to dispose of Nikopol, and is sending a monstrous creature to destroy him.

I have never in my life seen a movie with SO MANY weird questions, with no halfway-decent answers. Why is nobody upset about the floating pyramid? HOW does Horus know all this stuffn? Who's the hooded man and why is he dying? Where did Jill come from? What ARE the Egyptian gods? Why are all the gods naked? What's with that bird?

Now, I'll admit that there are some cool moments, such as Nikopol flying through the air like a feather on the wind, ""Willie,"" or the rather funny image of Egyptian gods playing Monopoly. And the future world sketched out in this movie is pretty enjoyably weird, like a surrealist version of ""Blade Runner.""

Unfortunately, the script is full of painfully pretentious moments (Nikopol keeps reciting Baudelaire), and clunky dialogue (""The blue of my tears stains human skin for good."" ""I feel blue... for you""). And there's a disturbing ""romantic"" subplot, in which Horus (using Nikopol's body) repeatedly rapes Jill, and of course Jill and Nikopol fall in love. Pretty sick.

And you know what's REALLY distracting? The creepy, over-smooth, vaguely misshapen CGI characters, all of which could easily be played by actual actors... but for whatever reason, instead we get these weird computer-generated puppets. Was it SO hard to cast people in this movie, or were they just showing off?!

The live actors are more of a mixed bag -- Hardy has a sort of punky vulnerability as a woman with no past and a murky biology, and Kretschmann is excellent as the hardened rebel who finds himself doing abhorrent things and finding love. But Charlotte Rampling is saddled with a weird haircut, and she spends most of her time onscreen looking like she's thinking, ""What am I doing here?!""

2257877,2,B0008ENI0W,"So this film comes in a fancy metal package to possibly give it a little heft and make you think you are getting more than you actually are. The back cover blurb claims this is a ""groundbreaking step in the future of film making,"" a claim I hope is far from the truth. A movie based on a graphic novel and it sure seems it. It is so full of CGI that this would almost qualify as an animated cartoon and is disconcerting as some of the characters are ""real"" and some computer generated (not very well as the moving mouths and voice over work doesn't necessarily match in many places). Some of the CGI sets are pretty well done but then some scenes of dubious quality intrude and break up the flow. Clunky. The plot is a hodgepodge of sci-fi elements that don't necessarily mesh all that well and the characterization is close to nonexistent. A 2-D story in the depiction of a 4-D world. I watched this and was like, ""Oh, yeah, Fifth Element, and, yep, reminds me of the Matrix and, ooh, there's some Bladerunner."" The thing that really ticked me off is that two-thirds of the way through the movie, my flawless, scratch free disc started freezing up on a DVD player that plays everything. So, I can't even tell you if the ending of the movie had any redeeming qualities. From the last point I saw, however, the point where the confused alien girl starts falling for the literary revolutionary guy who has been possessed by the avatar of an Egyptian god who is in the process of raping her FOR A SECOND TIME--yeah, I can't say it looked all that promising.

The film has its benefits: a nice visual style and some good visual effects. The concept is interesting and true deep sci-fi.
However, the film has a lot of problems. There are plot holes. Why on Earth do the residents of Earth seem to be more concerned with politics than some odd pyramid that suddenly appeared in the middle of their city?! Some scenes seem to be lost in translation due to the fact that certain actors didn't speak English. They seem to be reacting oddly. The CGI was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!! I understand that this movie was made when CGI was not as good as now; although, even compared to some movies with older CGI (i.e. Terminator 2),this movie's CGI still stinks.

2257891,3,B0008ENI0W,"When I first viewed IMMORTAL, I had heard nothing of it nor of its director.  All I knew of it was that it was a science fiction film that dealt with human eugenics experiments and an appearance by Egyptian gods in 2095.  Now this was indeed an enticing combination.  As the film began, I could see that the visuals, shot in animation and CGI, were the foundation.  Now when any film is presented in its near entirety with the viewer asked to visualize the plot through a kaleidescope, the result is either a smashing success or a crushing bore.  In this case, I would place IMMORTEL somewhere in the middle.  There were only three actors who were filmed more or less as human beings.  Two of them (Linda Hardy and Thomas Kratchsman) I had never heard of.  Charlotte Rampling was the third though I did not recognize her under her heavily made up face and banged hair. My interest was limited to how the plot followed a byzantine path that defied logic.  Director Enki Bilal, as I later found out, is a avante-garde director who specializes in tranferring comic books to the big screen as animations.  As I watched, I tried to decide how the movie would have turned out had a director other than Bilal been behind the camera.  I quickly realized that the result would not have made a big difference.  The failure of IMMORTEL was Bilal's determination to omit key facts needed as background.  Now I have no problem with a director forcing his audience to think, but in this case, I had to think too much, a problem exacerbated by the patently fake look of too many characters who looked like nothing but computer-enhanced Pillsbury dough boys.

I had some problem with the appearance of a pyramid suddenly popping into existence over New York City in 2095.  This problem was not that it appeared replete with bird headed Egyptian gods seeking to judge one of their own.  My comfort zone of believability was shattered when the typical New Yorker seemed not to care a whit.  I well know of blase New Yorkers, but their apathy was depressing.  There are too many plot twists to reveal here, though these twists served more to distance the viewer rather than engage him.  As the final credits rolled, I decided that IMMORTEL, like any film, could best be appreciated by those who already are fans of the genre and are willing to suspend disbelief even to the stretching point.  I was not and this is why I give it a middling three stars.",1250985600,3,2433,4.575057736720554

1) The writer/director simply poured into it everything he could think of: space aliens, aliens from extra dimensions, portals to unknown worlds, hybernation, space ships, flying cars, lasers, mutants, gods...

2) Nothing is explained and apparently no character has a motive to do anything they do. Why all Horus wants is to have sex, instead of escaping or clearing himself of charges (that are never explained)? Why did the pyramid come to Earth, since those ""special women"" are mentioned to appear all over the space? Why did the pyramid leave Earth and where did it go? Why it sometimes teleports, and sometimes moves slowly? Why did they suck in the fat guy? What did Nikopol do to deserve being frozen and why he didn't continue to do it after getting alive again (or at least ever mentioning it at least once)? Who/what is actually John and where did he go? What is the point of barriers around Central Park since they stopped no one from entering and leaving? What was inside killing people, except it wasn't later? What was that sparkling thing there?

*Includes English subtitles which can translate the parts of the movie that were spoken in Egyptian.  The only downside is that these subtitles need to be turned on manually.  But it's still good that it has some; the DVD version didn't have any, so I couldn't tell what was going on!
*Includes a making-of featurette and some trailers.
*Very excellent special effects. Visual imagery is so spectacular throughout the film that it is hardly ever dull (even though there's no real action to it).
*Good filming style with lots of vivid imagery.
*Excellent production design. Lots of funky sets, costumes, props, and loads of really cool flying cars.
*Fascinating characters. Lots of emotion; good acting and pretty good writing.

2257918,2,B0008ENI0W,"I saw this movie some time ago on cable and jotted some notes down...

'Immortal' suffers from wanting to be Blade Runner.  The tie-in to Ancient Egypt and their pantheon was interesting but I missed how that made any sense.

A hi-tech hourglass ticks away.  What does the cat goddess think of Horace's procreative trysts?

Intricate plot that is vague somehow.  Dialogue written by 'B'-level college creative writing students.  CGI characters all look like more like cartoons/anime except for the 'immortals' who didn't seem to fit with the animal heads.  Hot bodies, though, for unrated film, they didn't need to cover up Horace's privates.  Romance between the 'hero' and the lead female was too forced (literally).  Seemed to make light of rape.

The exchanges between the main character guy and Horace were overlong and it was never clear how Horace inhabits him.  The doctor (?) female pursuing the alien female protagonist seemed to have zilch character development.  Then there was the inexplicable series of shark/squid-like villain accoutrements that were laughably ineffective, though they looked cool in their evil way.

The main problem with the film is that the emphasis really is on surfaces and the 'stylized future reality bit', rather than a story.  It reminded me of latter day George Lucas, where the plot gets sketchy, the dialogue gets more stilted, the humor scarce, but everything looks and sounds really cool.

Immortal is sexy, or at least tries, but the reasons it's sexy seems to be to keep focus away from the half-baked plot.  The story line gets lost in the jumbled script, half-mentioned, and unfocused.  Horace wants to procreate?  So he takes over the male protag's body?

The whole thing would've made a great, highly stylized porn movie, but it's obvious they wanted to spice up the story with sex but didn't want to bother with the messiness of making the story at all sexual or make the sexual make sense.

Overall, the movie 'outcools' itself by looking good while saying very little. Blade Runner, though highly stylized, defined a genre of future Earth depictions white tell a very compelling story about the core nature of what it means to be human and, ultimately, the nature of immortality.

'Immortal', on the other hand, is an ancient Egypt fanclub flick, part cartoon, part real that looks simultaneously slick and, at times, ridiculous (Horace talks out of his throat and I swear I could see an actor's eyes peering through his beak at one point).

Given another year or so of massaging, editing, and developing the script, effects, etc. the would make an interesting film, but the kernel of the story focuses on Horace rather than the couple who are.. spoiler alert....

getting back together at the end (ironically, sine she has lost her memory - yet again).

2257932,3,B0008ENI0W,"I was just perusing Amazon when this recommendation came upon my screen.  The cover alone captivated me.  So I took the next step to start reading reviews and found it got fairly decent reviews.  I'm a pretty big science fiction buff and the premise sounded hugely unique, that sealed it for me, I had to try it.

So my friends and I sat down to watch this movie and we all agreed that the visualizations were well done.  Except for one point... when the film shifted from having real humans to having CG humans and then it shifted back and forth.  In a few scenes it was humans interacting with CG characters, but those were few and far between.  The change was so sudden that it just felt weird, and we were left wondering why the director thought this was a good idea.  Later we theorized that it was probably the people that had some sort of disease that was referenced in the film.  However, I would've liked to have gotten more explanation on this.  Then we saw the senator and thought maybe it wasn't all for those people.  Ultimately... we got confused.

Most of the script is pretty interesting and conceptually it's quite enthralling.  The black mark against this film is that they leave a lot of questions out there.  Such as why the gods are doing what they do?  I realize it's to mate with a female, but what's the point of that?  They never really explain the reason for the need... just that they want to do it.  It certainly brings up some very interesting parallels to history and the birth of demigods, which are fraught throughout historical writings.  It is pretty obvious that the director is into history, especially the religious kind judging by his name.  Enki is a Sumerian/Persian deity and ""Bilal"", I assume, is some perversion of the name Belial, also of Persian origin.

If you pay close attention to the film, you'll follow it on a decent level.  But there are parts that you just get lost with.  This obviously happens when the gods are speaking Egyptian and there are no words on the screen to tell me the translation unlike in ""Stargate.""  Imagine how lost you would be watching ""Stargate"" with no translations!  That's kind of the effect I walked away with on this film during those scenes.

Overall it's a decent movie.  I think the director was a little over ambitious in creating this world.  It felt like he tried to cram thousands of years of history into a two hour package and hope that the audience could fill in the gaps logically.  I mean some of it was obvious, like the flying car stints, I can definitely figure out they are influenced by films like ""The Fifth Element.""  Only he tried to combine the design with like a 1920's styled vehicle and an electric subway type of design... only all this is in the air.  See, that kind of thing I can backtrack.  The strange mutants because of a disease were a little harder to figure out, since I really don't have much of a historical reference for mutation other than the atomic bombs being dropped and the accident at Chernobyl.  Either way, I think you get my point.  The world is too big for people to just figure out on their own.  The visuals do make up for this in their own way, because it's a beautifully dark film in its own right.  I say give it a chance, but I hardly think it's worth owning as I don't see it to have all that much re-watch value.",1204243200,3,3350,4.444991789819376

So I decided to take a chance and buy it here at Amazon and needless to say I was not disappointed in the slightest!  This movie rules!  It carries a unique story of the Egyptian God Horus being judged for some kind of crimes upon conviction however he still has one week or so of freedom until his sentence is passed.  So what Horus decides to do is first find a suitable human or mutant body to take over so that he can find a suitable woman to mate with.  Unfortunately Horus's first few attempts end up in failure until he finds a cryogenically frozen convict named Alcides Nikopol or Nikopol for short who accidently escapes his frozen prison.  Anyway him and Nikopol meet and Horus makes him a metal prosthetic leg to replace the one he lost in the cryo-tubes accidental fall that freed him.  Well anyway one thing leads to another and then Horus and Nikopol finally discover a beautiful/sexy immortal woman named Jill.  After that Horus uses Nikopol to mate with this immortal beauty.  Anyway that's the basic plot more or less!  Needless to say however alot lot of triumph and conflict soon follow these three characters.

I have to say that the rest of the negative reviewers just don't ""get it.""  No, it's not  akin  to Blade Runner (I watched BR a couple of days ago, and apart from Rachel, that movie looks like it could have been shot last year!) - this movie is totally different. Sure, the blending on CGI and actors is at times rough, the plot line a little convoluted, and major characters are not explored enough, but overall the movie is a great viewing experience.

A better comparison would be to Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow - I movie I really can't watch any more simply because 1) I can't stand the characters, and 2) The SFX literally gives me a headache!  Immortal has a far superior plot, storyline and SFX.  Remember - it's a graphic novel brought to the screen, so it retains much of that look and feel.

Better to think of a blending of the Fifth Element and the Anime ""Sin.""

As for Immortal, the emphasis - and the audience focus should be on - the story, not the SFX.  Even with that caveat, it is stunning  eye candy, and Nikopol is the kind of character you can really wrap your mind around. General observations: The blue haired babe (Jill Bioskop) seems to be inspired by Farscape's Chiana. Watch it several times to catch odds and ends you may have missed - and to experience the imagery.

2257939,5,B0008ENI0W,"I'd first like to take issue with the many references to Blade Runner. Simply because a movie has a film noir atmosphere and is set in the near-mid future doesn't make it a Blade Runner clone.  The stories of these two films are nothing alike.  Enough said there.  :o)

Wow, this film looks fantastic.  It's major eye candy from start to finish.  I think the noir aspect goes slightly too far with the flying cars that look like the result of a 50's taxi getting a makeover on ""Junkyard My Ride,"" but otherwise it's as fascinating to watch as the plot is fascinating to see unfold.

I love the animal-headed Egyptian gods who feature strongly (mainly Horus, the film's focal point), and the story built around him and the female protagonist is interesting.  It draws just enough from mythology to feed the plot without trying to rewrite history, and the people and events surrounding them are interesting and relevent.

There is some ambiguity at times where you're not sure exactly what's going on and exactly what sort of future this is, but otherwise it's hard not to just sit back and be engrossed.  Ultimately I disliked Horus but at the same time understood how deep his motivations ran, and that sort of thing is important in character-building.  Visually...wow, what a piece of work he is.

I highly recommend this for any sci-fi fan, but even if that isn't your thing there's still a great story, great characters, and a nice noir feel to satisfy non sci-fi fans.  The sci-fi aspect doesn't overwhelm the story, even given the fantastic visuals and eye-catching aircraft.  Please support them and buy this so they'll make more.",1174435200,7,1636,4.75531914893617

The special effects and sets of Immortal, and this is not a huge budget film, are fantastic and richer than anything in Blade Runner. I admit George Lucas did a good job on the sets of the last two Star Wars movies, but Immortals' sets are just as good, more detailed and you have time to see them.

2257943,5,B0008ENI0W,"Absolutely one of the best and most intriguing sci-fi films I've seen in years, thank god for internet downloads, otherwise I doubt I ever would have even heard of this film. Having just acquired a new DVD player that will play DiVX-encoded movies, I set about trying to find various interesting sci-fi/fantasy films. Running across ""IMMORTEL (AD VITAM)"" I decided to look it up here on IMDb and see what the masses had to say about it.

Now, in my opinion, almost ANYONE can find something negative to say about ANY film - but the truly passionate ones come out and speak their mind when something truly moves them. Thus, I tend to ignore negative reviews and instead focus solely on the positive comments. And so it comes about that - even though I've been making use of this website for *MANY* years now - this will be my very first review of a film.

I disagree that this movie is solely for film purists and art lovers; although I definitely have a great appreciation for the indie sensibility and love a good art film, I also LOVE modern commercial animated flicks (though have never really gotten too heavily into anime) and have absolutely enjoyed most commercial science fiction such as Fifth Element, Blade Runner, Stargate (and the first few seasons of the TV show Stargate SG-1), Minority Report, the original 3 Star Wars, Red Planet, Mission to Mars, Screamers, Impostor, etc. Never having heard of Enki Bilal prior to this point (having only read one or two issues of Heavy Metal over the years, but have never really gotten too into them), I now see what a genius and visionary he is, and am now on a hungered quest to find everything he's done: the films TYKHO MOON and BUNKER PALACE HOTEL, as well as all of his graphic novels, including the Nikopol Trilogy (which will hopefully expand upon the universe he discusses in this film), The Beast Trilogy, and every other major piece of work from his arsenal of past releases.

As for this film: *INSTANTLY* one of my all-time favorites, I've already watched it twice in the past week, sitting transfixed and helplessly drawn into the gorgeous, sensual, deeply textured world he has envisioned. It's like the best of Fifth Element meets the best of Stargate, only far more artistic and soulful (not to denigrate either of those films; I loved both of them and watch each of them at least once every year or so just to reacquaint myself with their particular mythos.) But IMMORTAL? God, it's just GORGEOUS!! A little cryptic at first for those unfamiliar with Enki Bilal's work; I just sat there, jaws literally agape, utterly astonished at the detail and depth of the artwork. This is definitely a science fiction masterpiece - a film for anyone who enjoys serious atmosphere, texture, sensuality, artistry, and of course, bleak dystopian views of our future world. This is one movie which I will definitely be buying as soon as humanly possible - and all because of a chance download. Why the music & film industry doesn't openly embrace downloading is beyond me. I've discovered so many amazing films & music artists this way, and have since gone out to purchase all of my favorites to embrace the high quality and all of the wonderful extras that are available. Granted, I may be the exception to the rule, but with a VHS library of over 2500 films, 100+ laserdiscs, just under 500 DVD's and well over 3000 CD's, almost all of which I've purchased as a DIRECT result of things I've downloaded over the years, they are DEFINITELY not losing ANY money from this individual.

The plot is completely incoherent, even on repeated viewings, and apparently the same holds true for people who are already familiar with the material, from looking at what some of the other reviewers had to say.

I was not familiar with the backstory, which made it an even more confusing experience for me. I don't know how any reviewer could possibly praise this movie, because movies are first and foremost entertainment, and the film makers couldn't even string together anything remotely resembling a narrative. As others have said, there are scores of dead ends, if the characters have motivations there's no effort to explain them to us, and some of the acting is so bad it borders on the painful.

I bought this movie because a formerly trusted reviewer wrote that it had some flaws but would be a fun experience for sci fi fans. Nothing could be further from the truth, I will never trust that reviewer again, and I would advise the fanboys to stop hyping this movie. Even most bad films have some redeeming qualities that make them worth watching. This one does not -- it's a complete, utter waste of money, and I wish I could demand the film makers give me a refund.",1151712000,9,1207,4.604651162790698

2257966,1,B0008ENI0W,"Immortel (ad vitam) (Enki Bilal, 2004)

While I was not overly impressed with Bilal's Nikopol Trilogy on the page, I figured a film made out of it could be a pretty fun ride, and with Bilal himself at the helm, I had high hopes for it. Most of them, unfortunately, were dashed in the first few minutes.

The one thing everyone agrees on is that the film looks quite nice. And it does-- some of the CGI faces are so realistic they put me in mind of the best scenes in the Final Fantasy film. And the integration of actual actors and CGI characters is often seamless. The ""sets,"" though, are second-rate Bladerunner wannabes. There was a lot of potential in them, and most of it was wasted.

The acting, even when delivered by some pretty high-powered acting talent (Charlotte Rampling, for example), is atrocious. The two main actors, Linda Hardy (who, aside from this, has yet to land a major role) and Thomas Kretschmann (soon to be seen  in the film adaptation of The Celestine Prophecy) are both wooden. Rampling injects a touch of vivacity into her role now and then, but it's not nearly enough.

The plot is... well, I can definitively say there is a plot. And that it is, in fact, connected to the Nikopol Trilogy in some way. But when you don't meet the character of Nikopol until half an hour into a hundred-minute film, that should tip you off that things aren't staying completely faithful to the book. There are scenes you'll recognize, if you've read the Nikopol Trilogy, but I can tell you from experience: having read it does not make this movie any more lucid. In fact, it may add to the confusion.

In short, aside from the visually appealing aspect, I can't find a single thing about this movie to recommend to, well, anyone. *",1141171200,8,1744,4.538216560509555

2257979,1,B0008ENI0W,"Immortal incorporates a strange mixture of real actors and CG actors. Near the beginning of the film, you see a pyramid floating over a futuristic metropolitan city. Inside the pyramid we see a CG Egyptian god Horus come out of something similar to a cryogenic chamber, except he wasn't frozen. Then he pokes his head out of the pyramid (going right through the walls) and makes two helicopters crash into each other for no reason.

The rest of the movie involves Horus possessing an escaped (by accident) convict so that he can impregnate a woman.

Throughout the film there were many places in which an actor in makeup would have worked much better than the CG actors. The CG tried to look realistic but seemed like the quality of graphics I saw back in 1995. Amidst all of these CG human actors, there was a strange creature that looked like a red, bipedal hammerhead shark. The strangest thing about this is that this creature was a real physical costume and not CG animated, when CG could have made it so much more agile and less plastic.

We find out that this bipedal hammerhead shark is a genetically altered to make more human (hence the bipedal aspect) form of the original creature, which is supposed to be extinct. But later we see the original creature, in all it's CG glory, and it looks so much better, if not a bit like a goldfish or a betta.

All in all there were many characters introduced who sounded like they hand interesting backgrounds but those backgrounds were never explained and hardly hinted at. The story wasn't very well developed -- I was left asking ""Why would an Egyptian god want to impregnate a human woman?"" and ""Is she even human?"" and ""What is the purpose of the male lead character, other than to be possessed and have sex with the woman?""

Seriously. By the end of the movie I had no idea what went on except that the man had to take three times (practically raping the woman the first two times) before he actually succeeds in having intercourse, even though she seemed somewhat willing, or at least accepting that it had to be done (why? I do not know) each time.

I'm sure (I hope) the graphic novel goes into a lot more detail. Unfortunately it made a poor transition from the four color comic book to the big screen.",1139097600,8,2262,4.5318627450980395

The integration of these different types of performers is breathtakingly realistic at times. Unfortunately, the quality of the 3D characters are wildly uneven. For example, a completely pointless side story concerning a corrupt politician looks like a scene from a Playstation 2 game. It looks and feels rushed -- like this side story was added later to pad the running time. Or maybe the budget ran out.

The film's futuristic New York will remind you of ""The Fifth Element,"" only without the day-glo colors.  Like most of these movies that rely so much on special effects, the characters are dull and passionless while the plot is ponderous and puzzling.

He is definitely one of the best artists in the genre, though his story lines are somewhat convoluted and extremely multi-layered. It takes a bit of concentration to get the whole story, but the artwork is so fantastic, it's worth the effort. EXACTLY like this movie - which is essentially a Bilal story come-to-life (and CGI). It is quite a feat, especially, as others noted, with a fraction of the funds available for similar Hollywood fare.

The artwork in the original graphic novel is brilliant, and the film does a good job of getting the same gritty, strange feel.  And it does an excellent job of somehow making you care about the characters.  I agree with the other reviewers that the CGI wasn't as good as it could have been -- but it was OK and didn't cause me a major problem.

2257985,5,B0008ENI0W,"Watching Immortal is like reading a comic book. It's that close to the story's original medium, for which the creator of the Nikopol stories should be pleased. At first I found the switching back and forth between scenes of the human actors and scenes with just CGI characters confusing and unsettling and I thought I would write this film off as a waste of time. But I gradually became comfortable with the spectacle, even if the CGI was flawed. Some characters look too cartoonish and horribly fake, but then this was a French production with a limited budget (compared to Hollywood) and the behind the scenes feature explains that film animation is not big in France. All this considered, they don't do a bad job, especially with the cityscapes and flying cars.

The story itself demands viewer attention to piece plot elements together that are not immediately explained, or maybe never explained. This may be one of the great strengths of this movie, the creative refusal to explain everything and have tidy endings. I liked the mystery. It's the year 2095, the setting is New York, and humanity has taken to prolonging life and replacing body parts through cloning and artificial means. A corporation called Eugenics practically runs the city, has its own police force and the power to capture and dispose of people as it wishes. One of its captives is a mysterious young woman named Jill (Miss France Linda Hardy) who has pale white skin and blue tears. Jill also wields destructive power contained only by Eugenics hardware rigged to her head. She is rescued by an interested doctor (Charlotte Rampling) who studies her and puts her through clinical trials and we learn Jill eats like a pig (while remaining exceptionally attractive) and may not be human.

Now free to move about as she pleases, Jill has regular meetings with an even more mysterious John, whose head is completely wrapped in black bandages. He gives more clues that their origins are not of earth, but he is helping her become human. They have a strange connection to an ""intrusion,"" a warp in time and space that has existed for some time in Central Park. New Yorkers are warned not to enter the park and certain death awaits those who do try to sneak in.

Complicating this already convoluted plot, a flying pyramid has appeared over New York City, but nobody is paying much attention. It seems to take a few days for a leading political figure, a corrupt senator, to make a diplomatic mission to the pyramid. But before that happens, we learn the pyramid contains the actual gods of Egyptian legend. They have appeared again because Horus (the god with the hawk's head) has been judged by his fellow gods and is being allowed seven days on earth to fulfill a personal mission before his sentence. He needs to possess a male human host and impregnate a female. Trouble is, he has a hard time finding a man untainted by surgical enhancement. Until he finds the convict Nikopol, accidentally released from 30 years of cryogenic freezing. Nikopol was apparently imprisoned for fighting for the rights of the beings held captive by Eugenics.

Enter a softly-spoken detective who is trying to find a serial killer who is making a big bloody mess out of his victims. The detective himself was messed up from an encounter with a shark-like alien some years back. You start to get the picture how many subplots are in this film!

The CGI works best for the buildings and flying cars, and the impressive shark-like alien, but it falters when it comes to rendering people. Like another reviewer said, CGI still has trouble making skin look authentic. The Egyptian gods also could have been done better, but overall it was a satisfying visual experience. Immortal's triumph is in weaving all its intricate plot threads together, retaining mystery, and leaving you wondering and wanting more, but still satisfying.",1128729600,7,3880,4.846153846153846

The script, however, is it weakest point, having a few holes in the story line that make it confusing to follow at times.  Those with a knowledge of the Director fare better than those of us getting our first taste.  This is also definitely a movie that benefits from watching more than once.

I didn't know that this movie was going to be played mostly in CGI. Everything in New York is all done in CGI except for Jill, Nikopol and the doctor.

The first thing I thought when I saw Jill, the background, and the pyramid in mid air over New York City was the fate of the world lies only in her hands, boy was I wrong.

You didn't trust the senators - No surprise there, and you most certainly wanted to STAY AWAY from Central Park!!

Jill did not know who she is and what she was, all she know was that she had some special powers. Her tears are blue and if you touch her where her tears have falled then that part of your body will be permantly blue- forever!! The doctor (played by Charlotte Rampling,and Thomas Ket-something, are the only two characters i knew in this movie) wanted her, only to study her. It almost seems like she knew exactly who Jill is. Horus a crazy god with a bird head from the pyramid only wanted to redeem the few glorius days he had, just looking for her, Jill. So you know Horus, a naked man with a head of a bird just can't go around New York City as himself so he searches for a body, but all the bodies he would go into were all remade with a new heart,brain, or liver, and he just can't live that way, that's where Nikopol (Thomas) comes in, very good looking man. Horus uses his body to get Jill, Jill is aware that something is going on but can't really put her finger on it, she can't even use her powers on him either, and she couldn't get enough of him. You almost felt sorry for Jill when she went to the musuem just to know what it was to be human, act human, even love, kiss, and fall in love like a human. Immortal was beautifully done, the directing of the movie was to the point, I'm just hopping that the director will just finish it, because it can't just end like that.",1128211200,3,2024,4.142493638676845

At times the CGI is obvious (skin is still notoriously difficult to render), but the backdrops of a futuristic New York are considerably better done. The technology on display is clunky and grubby - the air cars bring back thoughts of the fifties and trams (or trolley cars on the other side of the pond).

The story revolves around Horus who is allowed back to Earth for seven days - a single beat of Gods heart - to visit the planet he created. He comes with Bast and Annubis in a floating pyramid, but inhabits the body of a human much of the time.

As you might expect with a God, he's obsessed with sex, specifically finding and making pregnant one woman. She has blue hair and white skin and has just appeared from an alien intrusion in Central Park. She takes the rape (which is shown as a very mild sex scene) by a God unnaturally well.

The film ends with her and her child in Paris, but it doesn't feel set up for a follow on.

2258006,4,B0008ENI0W,"Bilal is best known as a comic artist. I've liked his work visually: he tends towards a restrained and idiosyncratic palette of colors, but uses strong color where it makes a point. He makes each character stand out, and counts more on visual impact than physical credibility for bringing his worlds to life. I've always found uncertain narrative development in Bilal's stories, but with visuals that keep me going to the end.

That's what this movie was like: visually powerful, but baffling as a story. Ancient Egyptian gods come to Earth, in a massive pyramid poised over a major city. The city takes surprisingly little notice, until an exiled god seeks a human host body, then seeks a human female. OK, it's enough to carry the movie, but nothing spectacular. It's all the characters that make it work as an experience for the eyes, with their distortions, exaggerations, and unique visual style.

That style is carried in an alternation of live action sequences (with CG effects, of course), and animation on a par with Final Fantasy. The alternation wasn't quite seamless, but wasn't quite blatant enough to act as a narrative tool - I hope his future films make better use of each medium's strengths. The general styling stuck close to the subdued colors of Bilal's comics, even a restrained blue for the skin tones of the Jill, the female lead. Color dominates only in the final scene, richly enforcing the ""new day dawning"" theme.

""Immortal"" is a remarkable crossover for a well-known comic artist, apparently adapted from his ""Nikopol Trilogy"" of DC comics. It's an exciting effort, and enough to keep me eager for more.

The Egyptian deity is a major character so his stiff fake CG rendering is displeasing.

The story really makes me wonder. It raises a lot of interesting questions such as the appearance of a flying pyramid over New York and the presence of Horus and several other Egyptian gods. There is precious little explanation as to why the gods have returned or their purpose. The Earth of 2095 is never fleshed out  to any degree of satisfaction. The characters such that they are lack any true motivation or any depth. The mix of computer generated and human actors is also ill considered and makes several scenes seem like bad cut-scenes from video games.
