3919314,5,B002EQA148,"I am a physician (retired surgeon) and this book is a must read for anyone with back pain, neck pain, weird pain, any pain. I am not throwing all my medical school learning aside but Dr. Sarno has a lot to say and, guess what, it does not HURT one to read the book and ponder its message.",1344816000,25,288,3.9827586206896552
3919315,5,B002EQA148,I was pleased with the DVD. It is only 14 minutes long but it gives a brief overview of Dr. John Sarno's treatment for back pain. I admit that I found it online free after I purchased it but the quality of this one is much better and nice to have to share with friends who have back pain!,1318377600,17,288,3.8983050847457625
3919316,5,B002EQA148,"I have read all of Dr. Sarno's books. As a family nurse practitioner I remember thinking, ""If just half of the U.S. supported this, a lot of doctors and drug companies would be out of business."" I must admit that we have made mistakes (and continue to do so). I don't know who decided to coin the term ""degenerative disk disease"" for what is essentially arthritis, but many patients I see wear this like a badge of honor. ""But I have...degenerative disk disease!"" I try to explain that most of us over 30 years of age DO. It's not a disease, it's a normal part of getting old. I'm not sure about the theory about tennis elbow being a subconscious manifestation.
The sad reality is that when I try to discuss this with patients, I'm fighting the medical community at large. The word ""psychosomatic"" has become a four letter word. Thanks, Dr. Sarno.",1310688000,38,847,4.542483660130719
8368246,4,B002EQA148,Excellent dvd and the story covered in this particular 20/20 is well worth the money i spent on this!  I believe that Dr. Sarno is really onto something!  Anyone in horrible chronic pain owes it to themselves to take a gander at this.,1477612800,,234,4.4186046511627906
8368247,1,B002EQA148,ALL it did was tell about a lecture Dr. Sarno does that is helpful but the dvd did NOT reference where or how to find how to attend the lecture; waste of money,1467331200,,159,3.8484848484848486
8368248,5,B002EQA148,This was the most helpful medical video that I've seen in a very long time.  I later ordered additional materials referenced in the video.,1453161600,,138,4.75
8368249,3,B002EQA148,"Had already seen it.
The 3 books and 1 audio book were great!",1423440000,,61,3.769230769230769
8368250,5,B002EQA148,"Not only do I have it in VHS - but now in DVD - terrific!!!! Everyone with back pain, leg pain, etc. must view this.  A life changer.  Cheers, Dr. Sarno, for all your good work!",1415232000,,177,3.888888888888889
8368251,5,B002EQA148,This video and book was great! It has helped me and my family deal with pain issues and made our lives so much better. I would suggest anyone with any kind of pain to read this.  It will change your life!,1395014400,2,204,3.975609756097561
8368252,5,B002EQA148,"I have read all the writings of Dr. Sarno as well as spending time with him personallyin his office. He is literally a miracle worker way ahead of his time. As a dentist who has treated TMJ and other chronic pain problems of the head and neck for 40 years I can testify to the validity of his theories and the successful outcomes in over 90% of the cases he treats. If interested in his work I highly recommend purchasing the 20/20 episode as it will give a great overview of Dr. Sarno""s work in a very interesting format. Richard H. Haines,DMD",1391126400,10,544,4.3431372549019605
8368253,5,B002EQA148,"If you have back, neck, shoulder pain. If you have pain that seems to move around your body. If you have ANY pain that seems weird because it can be set off by seemingly harmless movement or simply comes and goes, you must find out about Sarno's take on your misery. After decades of periodic back and neck episodes that put me in bed essentially crippled, I am now -- thanks to Sarno -- pain free for about 30 years. You can watch this disc to get a good idea of what his ""treatment"" is all about. I was cured by simply reading one of his books called ""Curing Back Pain"". I have bought that book a dozen or more times and given it to people who are suffering, some of them on the verge of surgery. In more than half the cases, these folks quickly stopped having pain and have been free of pain ever since reading the book. Do not be fooled by the title: This book may well cure any chronic pain you have. You can ask your orthopedist about it, but keep in mind that orthopedists make a very good living partially by ignoring Sarno's work.",1387497600,15,1039,4.2
8368254,5,B002EQA148,I had this segment on a video tape and show it to clients. I love Dr. Sarno and this segment really allows clients to think about the medication they are taking and trying alternatives. a MUST SEE for anyone with back or neck pain.,1382054400,2,231,4.2727272727272725
8368255,5,B002EQA148,This provides a great introduction to the work of Dr. John Sarno M.D. on the psychological basis of pain particularly as it relates to the back and neck.,1377302400,,153,4.5
