8091016,4,B000BQ7JJ8,"Ok mid-60's Mexican-made, Spanish-language (no sub-titles) action adventure El Santo film.  He and handsome Jorge Rivero play secret agents who wrestle on the side.  They have to foil villains who have stolen Moctezuma's treasure.  They divvy up the chores equally.  Rivero takes care of the bad girl babes and El Santo engages the bad boys in fisticuffs.  Not as fun as when he fights monsters but not bad.  The Laguna Films DVD is good quality.  Recommended for El Santo fans.",1472342400,,478,4.9
