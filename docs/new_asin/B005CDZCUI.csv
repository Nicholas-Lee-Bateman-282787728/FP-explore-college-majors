4652607,5,B005CDZCUI,"Toradora does extremely well in terms of animation and music. The technical aspects really appealed to me immensely. The animation and art style appealed to me strongly because despite being simple at times, it has a large array of bright colors and the characters are all noticeably well drawn and very smoothly animated. (Much unlike the girls in Clannad whom all tend to look somewhat the same. I do love Clannad but that's one gripe I have with it.)

It has an amazing overall soundtrack but more importantly, it has, in my opinion, one of the most memorable musical pieces in anime. (If you've watched this you know what I'm talking about) The voice acting is, to be entirely honest, not amazing, but good enough so that there are no real gripes I can make about it. In addition, the series is incredibly funny. It's a brand of humor that may not appeal to everyone but I personally loved it. Toradora, in my opinion, was able to very fluidly and naturally transition from humor to drama throughout the series and this was why it appealed to me so well. Lastly, and most importantly, the characters are all incredibly likeable! (And if not they become likeable by the end of the series.) I'm not sure if I've ever seen a more likeable cast of characters. There aren't many primary characters but because of this fact, each character can be thoroughly understood throughout the series. Personally, I love Toradora. As an anime, it would definitely be one of the best ones I've watched. As I've said, it has many flaws so I believe the likeability of this series depends highly on how much you mind these flaws and so: personal preference. I cannot express the opinions of others and so I will only express my own opinions to the best of my abilities.

As for those of you that enjoy high school slice of life romantic comedies, if you haven't seen Toradora, definitely put it high on the list of anime you'd want to be watching as its humor and cuteness will definitely draw you in.

I read the other reviews good and bad. I the watched the whole series on You tube -Twice.
By then I was so hooked I had to buy the whole series! Good points- Great animation, Very well fleshed out characters,
The funniest anime in my collection! Great story lines, A truly great romance, Satisfying final resolution to series.
So good you want to watch it over and over and will still pickup new nuances every time through.
Just watch the whole first episode on You tube and you'll be hooked too.
Bad points- There are no bad points!!!
The series is in two volumes, The one I am reviewing and volume 2 standard edition, 25 total episodes.
It is in Japanese with English subtitles -you will prefer it this way after watching it, its hilarious!
My top recommendation to this, it is my new favorite!

UPDATE- I just received my DVD's They are crystal clear transfers in widescreen. The English
subtitles have been slightly updated from those I saw on You Tube and make more sense to the
story. Be sure to watch the last episode all the way through the end of the credits or you
will miss very important scenes. -Enjoy.",1327536000,12,1301,5.165876777251185
4652609,4,B005CDZCUI,"I was getting irritated reading some of the other reviews so I decided to make my own. ToraDora was one of the first animes I watched all the way through in Japanese with english subtitles and I really enjoyed it. Fans of Ouran or Fruits Basket should definitly give this one a try. I haven't recieved the discs yet but I'm really excited to add them to my collection. The books are currently being printed in English and I've heard rumors that a English Dub series is on the way. While the ending may not be satisfactory for some fans, others may not have a problem with it, if it irritates you that much just watch it on YouTube or something before you decide whether or not to buy.",1325376000,2,684,4.310077519379845
4652610,5,B005CDZCUI,"Great series, was cute and a fun watch, don't let the debbie downers tell ya its crap. It's definitely worth the watch.",1324857600,3,119,4.454545454545454
4652611,1,B005CDZCUI,"There is a very big problem with Toradora.  Unfortunately, I can't tell you what it is without a caveat, because it's a major spoiler.

So here it is: spoiler warning.  If you don't want to know why this series belongs in the trash, don't continue reading.  Watch the series instead, and find out for yourself.

Spoiler ahead....

All right then, here goes.  The very big problem with Toradora is the ending.  As with too many Anime series, the writers have been incapable of finishing the story without tossing an incredibly inane reversal in the faces of the viewers.

I'm not sure why the other reviewers haven't mentioned this.  Maybe they're OK with this sort of thing for some reason.  I am not.  I am especially not OK in the case of Toradora because the reversal, while as extremely disappointing as such reversals can be, was also completely preposterous.  As in, ""never mind everything that the characters have been saying, doing, and feeling up to this point.  We'll do just the opposite, because this is Opposite Day.""

That's it in a general nutshell.  The reversal of everything established in the series up to that point is executed with such an arbitrary abandon of logic and continuity that it completely wrecks the entire mood of the series.

Still want details?  OK: after a very touching, romantic scene between Ryuji and Taiga at his granparents' house, and after Ryuji has succeeded in reuniting his mother with his grandparents, and after Ryuji and Taiga have repeated their promise that the ""Dragon and the Tiger shall always be at one another's side"", Taiga leaves.  Gone.  Out of the picture.

She abruptly leaves after She, Ryuji, and his mother return to their homes.  She says she will return for supper after she meets with her own mother in her apartment.  Only in her apartment, she finds that her mother has left.  There are a number of frantic, angry, (other emotions) messages left on her cell.  She listens to parts of a few of those, then goes out on her balcony.

There is one star in the sky.  She now decides that she is that star, and must learn to shine on her own, ""so I can love him"".  Then she's shown walking away with a suitcase.

Later we learn that she's returned to live with her mother.  Guess it's time for Taiga to learn to shine on her own, at home with mommy.

These scenes are so ridiculous, contrived, and pretentious that they literally back-slap the audience with a clear message from the writers: ""Ha, ha, we fooled you!""

There is a scene earlier in the series in which Yashuka and Taiga's best friend, Minorin, are running against each other in a footrace to determine who will win the right to place a tiara on the head of the queen of the school's cultural festival.  That queen is Taiga, who for various reasons (one of them being that her father didn't show to see her stage performance) desperately needs the support.  There are manu challenges in the race for Ryuji, including abusive opponents who knock him down to take his lead away.  Minorin enters the race at this point, to stomp on the bad guys and allow Takusah to win.  Only he doesn't surge ahead to win.  He turns back to where Minorin is holding down the bad guys and takes her hand.  Hand-in-hand, they finished the race together and both place the tiara on Taiga's head.

It's a very moving scene, a moment of great happiness for Taiga following the heartbreak she experienced when her father didn't show.

There were similarly moving scenes in the series.  And then....

And then, the last scene with the suitcase is flung like raw sewage all over the story.

There is a ham-handed attempt at closure after the credits in the last episode.  Ryuji is shown returning to an empty classroom.  He looks around, mumbles something about ""the one who knows where to find it"", or some such other blathering nonsense, and opens a standalone locker in the back of the room.  He first met Taiga when this locker fell open to reveal her, and now, sure enough, she's standing there.

She says, ""I wanted to surprise you.""  Well.  She's home again. How long was she gone?  Is she going to stay?  Does she still love hime?  Will they still marry?

Never mind all that. He asks her, ""Have you grown?""

She says, ""Not a millimeter"".

""I love you"", he says.  (He never did manage to say this, even during their romantic scene at his grandmother's house).

So what does she do?  How do the writers make the sewage smell like roses?

They don't, that's how.  She gets angry, butts him in the jaw with the top of her head, and screams ""How dare you say something embarrassing like that in broad daylight????""

End of story.

Yeah, that fixed it all right.  A couple who promise to marry and share an intimate moment together in an earlier episode, now can't get through a mutual expression of love without getting into an adolescent scuffle.

Still smells like sewage to me.

Nice going, Anime writers.  Chalk up another idiotic ending to an otherwise great series.

Stupid.",1323561600,6,4986,4.622857142857143
4652612,5,B005CDZCUI,"I really do appreciate the lightheartedness of the anime. Toradora I find comparable to the Ouran High School Host Club Series, in that it doesn't take itself too seriously and the parts that are dramatic are suitable for the situation. The animation is clean and crisp and you'll find yourself relating to the characters from the beginning of the series all the way to the end. This anime is one of those rare jewels were I found myself laughing aloud and saying ""A[...]"" at the romantic moments. Of all the upstanding animes this one by far sticks out in my mind. I believe this series is perfect for the romantic, comedy, shoujo, lovers and definitely recommend watching it a thousand times over. :)",1311811200,16,702,4.715447154471545
4652613,4,B005CDZCUI,the series is subtitled but otherwise pretty good an entertaining. it might be a bit funnier if it was in English,1367971200,,113,4.428571428571429
4652614,5,B005CDZCUI,"The entire story and how it was written was done really well. It is a great anime for someone who is looking to see what anime is about and can be about. Many people I talk with usually think that anime is about fighting with swords and demons and nudity, but this is not anywhere near that. This is a simple, beautifully written anime great for almost any age older than 13",1367798400,,374,4.208333333333333
4652615,5,B005CDZCUI,"Ryuji and Taiga meet by coincidence. As it turns out, they have a crush on each others best friend. They also happen to live next door to each other. Despite their totally different backgrounds and attitudes, they decide to team up and help the other get close to the ones they love. As time passes, the pair begins to feel something comforting and natural about being with one another. What will they do about the feelings they have had all this time? What will they do about the new feelings that have surfaced? One thing is for sure. In a love pentagon, a few hearts are bound to be broken.

This series starts off kind of silly. It actually remains that way most of the way through. At the same time, it deals with very serious and intense emotions. There are times when I thought, "" oh my gosh, this is stupid"". There were also times when I almost cried . It's a lot like Clannad or Kanon in that regard. There are a lot of great characters, plot twists, and plenty of emotion to go around. The production quality of this series is also very good. The animation, soundtrack, and voice actors are all top notch.

I do have a few issues with Toradora though. I really wish it was dubbed, for one. It's hard to relax when you're undivided attention  is focused on reading subs. You can't turn away for a second because much of the dialogue is very important. My other problem is the ending. It's not the worst ending I've ever seen, but it doesn't seem to fit. After all the characters had been through together, you would expect them to be different. That's all I'll say about that though.

Despite my 2 issues with Toradora, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. I think it ranks up inn my top 10 anime dramas ever. It's also kind of expensive like many other anime series out there. I got mine from  PlayTech-Asia.com. The entire series comes on 2 DVDs and it cost under $30. I highly recommend this series to any anime fan, and I suggest checking out the deal PlayTech-Asia has on it. You won't regret it.",1363478400,3,2007,4.4135135135135135
4652616,5,B005CDZCUI,"I bought (along with a Volume 2 dvd) this sort of blindly. I had never seen Toradora! before, and my internet is terrible, so I decided to stop streaming and go with dvd's for awhile. This was an amazing purchase. The storyline is awesome, the characters are easy to connect to, the intro and ending themes are top-notch among anime (in my opinion), and its overall just a fun series to watch. I absolutely recommend it. A great romantic/ slice-of-life anime!",1359936000,,459,4.679012345679013
4652617,5,B005CDZCUI,"I've only become an anime fan in the past year, but I've already familiarized myself with that well-tread battleground - high school based romance anime. They're nearly inescapable if you've been a fan for any length of time, and you've probably at least seen one or two (I certainly have). So, you can imagine my surprise when I found myself completely, utterly wrapped up in this series.

Toradora is more like a love square than a triangle, that centers on Takasu Ryuji and Aisaka Taiga. Their relationship is an odd one at best, since they are two people that could not be on further ends of the spectrum from each other. And the catch that binds them? They both happen to be best friends with the other person's crush, and knowing this, unite to help each other win the affection of their respective love interests. The settings, the archetypes, and the plot will all be familiar to a veteran otaku, but Toradora manages to rise above that. Why?

This show happens to have an excellent balance of both comedy and drama; it vacillates back and forth between both aspects without them ever butting heads or creating a disjointed viewing experience. One 23 minute episode can span the gamut between laugh out loud funny and deadly serious without ever feeling forced. And that lends itself to great characterization - it not only lets you get to know what makes these characters tick and watch them grow, but they feel like they could be your own goofy high school friends, too.

Without a doubt, Toradora is one of the most balanced, well-paced romantic animes I've seen, and if you give it a chance, it's sure to become one of your favorites.",1355097600,,1646,4.688581314878893
4652618,5,B005CDZCUI,"I love romantic comedies and this is possibly one of the best out there aside from Ouran High School Host Club.

I know most people dislike the ending to this series but personally I like it. If nothing else this anime has the best kissing scene, ever!

My only complaint about Toradora! is that NIS of America has not and at this time have no plans of releasing this series on Blu-Ray.",1349395200,,386,4.347222222222222

4652620,4,B005CDZCUI,"I really like this anime. It tells a great story and has many arcs in its 24 episode run. The characters are unique and believeable, which is not something you see in anime very often. I would recommend this to anyone who likes this type of anime, and maybe even to those who don't. ToraDora is that good to me. But the font used for the subtitles on the amazon version is way to small for my taste. I haven't seen the DVD release subtitles, but compared to the other subtitled anime I've watched through other sources, amazon fails in comparison. That is literally my only gripe for this series, and it's not even about the series itself, just how it was handled in this release version. I highly recommend anyone interested give ToraDora a watch because you'll enjoy every episode. Just maybe try to find a different version with a larger font.",1344470400,2,846,4.5359477124183005
4652621,5,B005CDZCUI,"Most of my favorite anime series tend to fall under the action/adventure category but upon watching Toradora I suddenly have a romance comedy in my top 3. I could go into tons of detail but to keep from spoilers I will keep this short. (Kind of)

I like just about everything in this series from the animation to the plot and characters. Recently I have been growing tired of this kind of anime as the male lead always seems to be a worthless and clueless fool who doesn't deserve half the sentiment directed towards him. Though Ryuji can seem a tiny bit clueless at times, Toradora does a great job in developing its characters, even avoiding the previous description of male leads. Overall I find all the characters to be believable and for the the most part empathize with each character's situation. The pacing also seems about right as nothing seemed to happen too soon or drag on for too long.

I will also point out this has no English dub whatsoever. I usually don't bother with undubbed anime as I wait for the dub to be released. I prefer to hear the audio in a language I can understand but this series seems to be an exception for me as the subs just seem to add to the shows setting. Either way the subs don't detract from the experience of the show at all and for those like me who would prefer not to mess with subs, I will just say that not liking subs is a rather lame excuse for missing out on a great story. That is one thing that this anime brought to my attention and am definitely happy about that.

In closing this anime is done amazingly well with the relatable characters it developers and the issues each one faces. Without a doubt this series is one of my all time favorites and anyone remotely interested in this series or who ever is just skimming reviews looking for something new to watch I strongly recommend Toradora.",1339200000,2,1850,4.419354838709677

Even more rarely, the combination of characters and story capture my imagination. I thoroughly enjoyed ToraDora. I don't want to give anything away, so talking about the plot's almost impossible. But the four main characters -- Taiga Aisaka, Ryji Takasu, Minori Kushieda, Ysaku Kitamura, and Ami Kawashima felt real to me. The narrative gave them time to develop, and the plot's pacing kept my interest. I hate to admit it, but the last couple of scenes (make sure to watch the scene after the credits for the last episode) felt satisfying! I recommend it for anyone high school aged or older (and I'm considerably older!).",1387929600,2,768,5.0078125

Overall, I find the anime to be well-written and the voices to fit the personalities quite well.

Note- It is in the Japanese language, but it has the option to have English subtitles.
