8132572,1,B000GI3KTY,"This is a low-budget, British production.  As much as I hate cheesy reenactments, the still paintings and clips from B&W movies were dull.  The British narrator's accent isn't thick, but he is still hard to understand without the volume turned way up.  I am almost sure better pirate documentaries exist.  Only view this if you, or your child, is a hardcore pirate fan.",1168646400,7,369,4.809523809523809
