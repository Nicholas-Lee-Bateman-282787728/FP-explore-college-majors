4171622,2,B003QQJGQO,"This is a poor plot if I ever saw one. The parasites look good for the most part and I had hopes the story could hold together but oh no. The story just falls flat and becomes a bunch of babel about pushing the human evolution up a few notches, sure, hit me up with some cool parasites doc. I want to be a super human, sounds great. Ian Patrick Williams is pretty creepy in his roll as Mason and really show me how bad old Richard Riehle is in his role as the man who may save the day. Now if your a Nora Kirkpatrick fan like I am you may have to see this flick. Nora has been in a bunch of TV shows and I think she really is the only resign to see this film. Christopher Shand is good in his roll as Justin and I look forward to seeing him in a good movie some day. But two or three good actors can not save a bad film in this case. Pass this turd right on by folks and if you must check it out don't say I didn't tell you so.",1296777600,,927,3.7106598984771573
4171623,4,B003QQJGQO,"Typical ""B"" creature feature; which I like. Fun but not ""deep"". If you want an artsy fartsy movie with meaning....look elsewhere.",1294704000,,129,5.190476190476191
4171624,5,B003QQJGQO,"I'm a fan of low budget horror films. I'm especially fond of films that take chances. Growth did. There were scares and thrills and interesting characters. I especially liked the camera work. I found the special features to be enlightening and fun. All in all, glad I bought it.",1292630400,,278,4.6938775510204085
4171625,3,B003QQJGQO,"I was wondering why some scenes just kept going and going, but most of the movie
was pretty good, with good slug effects. Then if you look at the extras you can
see why. This is another ' don't have enough budget ' movie. They didn't have much
and used all the tricks in the book to have this movie made with what they had.
 I have to give all a thumbs up for the good work they did on the film, but the
end product suffers a bit due to all the shortcuts.
So in the end, its a pretty good movie, but i don't think i want to watch it a
second time.",1287964800,3,547,3.756521739130435
4171626,5,B003QQJGQO,The Movie was all that I expected. I was a little suprised that it didn't get more airtime before it's release. I give this movie 4 buckets of popcorn out of 5. Well Worth the time.,1286582400,,181,4.055555555555555
4171627,3,B003QQJGQO,"GROWTH is a derivative, yet satisfying, fun watch.  I rented the film.  It isn't something I would own at a high price, but it was an enjoyable watch.  Mircea Monroe just shines in this film and is a fantastic quirky character.  The entire cast does a good job trying to take a typical plot and treat it with dignity and seriousness.  The special effects are decent enough.  The plot moves at a good pace.  It does have a few holes, but this is an expectation in this type of film.  It is a fun way to kill some time, but don't expect to be swept away.",1286236800,7,552,4.1415094339622645

4171629,4,B003QQJGQO,"The movie starts slow, but gets going after a few minutes. The theme is typical of an experiment gone awry! Man is always screwing around with something he has no business messing with. Always thinking about the almighty dollar, instead of ""what's safe"". Worth watching twice, the kind of movie you might miss something the first time around.",1284768000,2,342,4.913793103448276
4171630,1,B003QQJGQO,"Sounded promising, fairly cover artwork,... for one of the most boring ""horror"" movies you will have the misfortune to rent. Keeping this review short, as watching this video already wasted 40 minutes of my life, waiting for it to get even remotely interesting or thrilling... no such luck. Let me save you the lost time and money - don't rent this one. The plot is non-existent and it moves slower than a snail, poor acting, even worse directing, with special effects worthy of a 10-year-old using a 20-year-old laptop.",1284595200,2,520,4.853932584269663
4171651,5,B003QQJGQO,"Let me start by saying that I didn't expect much of this movie and now I will admit I was wrong. For a very low budget movie it held my attention, grossed me out from time to time and had me enthralled. Story was very good, directing was good, overall the acting was very good, too. If you are a horror fan, you could do worse than this movie, I loved it and I also have to say the stand out performance goes to Christopher Shand who played the step brother and the reason was he had to change gears with his character in the movie, from sickly and wimpy to confident and tough.

4171654,5,B003QQJGQO,"True story.... I purchased this movie because it looked soooooooooooooo interesting in the previews.
and I was correct.... very interesting movies and the suspense is INcredible....
PROBLEM =  it scared me so much.... I am afraid to finish watching the movie LOL  it is true.
I have had the movie around 2 or 3 weeks now....  and I will finish watching it at some point :-)
right now... I am still scared to finish watching the movie :-(  its scary.

4171657,2,B003QQJGQO,"I thoroughly enjoyed the special effects...quite creepy...but beyond that this was a slow-moving...plotless...boring sci-fi flick with little or no substance.  Sub-par acting, a horrible soundtrack, and mediocre editing made this one a ""possibility"".  It could have been a box-office smash...but it missed on nearly every level.  Another reviewer claimed this will grow on you.  Not on me.  One time is enough.  2 stars...for the special effects.",1309651200,,446,5.681818181818182
4171658,4,B003QQJGQO,"GROWTH is a sci-fi / horror film in the tradition of FLESHEATERS, BRAIN EATERS, SLITHER, THE HIDDEN, NIGHT OF THE CREEPS, etc., where parasites invade the bodies of the unwary, mutating them into automatons of doom. Jamie (Mircea Monroe) brings her boyfriend, half-brother, and best friend to an island she's inherited. Unbeknown-st to them, this island was the site of a  biological disaster 25 years earlier, resulting in many deaths. Now, something is loose and Jamie and company are in for a rather disgusting shock! Not bad for a low-budget effort. The slippery critters are fairly well realized, but CGI always has that synthetic, cartoonish look...",1307923200,6,655,5.179245283018868

8402447,3,B003QQJGQO,"There's a lot to like here. A lot. I especially liked the scene where the rather restrained, introverted fellow, having been infected by the genetics-changing parasite, goes out to a bar, walks right up to a beautiful woman and hits on her, and then beats the crap out of the local boys who are protective on her. I think if you just cut and pasted it over the dance scene in Spider Man 3 you would have a much better movie.
spoilers follow
But things feel far too slapped together overall. And worse, I kept asking myself, ""Why are these people so stupid?"" They walk into a field they know is loaded with parasites, and then just at random decide it would be a good idea to tape their pants legs shut. Why not before walking into the field? And then the leader of the town council goes to the lair of the madman infected psychopath and he's like, ""Mason, I'm not armed."" Why the hell not? And you have this team of heavily armed guys attacking a dangerous man they know has superhuman strength and agility. And once they have him surrounded, they proceed to tackle him in hand-to-hand-combat one at a time or once in pairs. Come on folks.
Still, if you love movies like Slither and Splinter, you'll probably dig this. I did..",1411862400,,1226,4.429203539823009
8402448,2,B003QQJGQO,"Growth (Gabriel Cowan, 2010)

Growth is one of those movies about which a whole lot of people are unloading a whole lot of calumny over on the IMDB boards. I've got an hypothesis about that (don't I always?). A lot of the things folks are sayingand I add, even before we get into it, that most of them are accurateare the kinds of things that people say about movies that inspire ennui, not ire; it's boring, it's got plotholes you can drive a truck through, the acting is awful (that one I will dispute, at least in part, later on), the script is worse, etc. Nothing you haven't seen in hundreds of other DTV low-budget special effects extravaganzas. I think the reason that one has drawn so much hatred is that somewhere under the surface of this movie is a really, really goodperhaps greatmovie. I think people are reacting to that, rather than the film we got. And that is a valid approach to criticizing the movie. But on the other hand, that also tends to give short shrift where it is, perhaps, undeserved; if you can separate what could have been from what is and overlook a few shortcomings that really are as bad as people make them out to be, this is actually not an awful way to kill ninety minutes if you're a fan of creepy-crawly horror.

Plot: researchers in a secret genetic lab on a remote island make a breakthrough in 1989, but it ends up getting loose and causing a massacre. Fast-forward twenty years. Jamie Ackerman (Magic Mike's Mircea Monroe), who escaped the terror of that night, and a handful of her friends return to the sparsely-populated island to sell her family's property. But something feels off. Larkin (Office Space's Richard Riehle), the mayor, warns her away almost as soon as she sets foot on the island, and the rest of the islanders look at her as if they haven't eaten in weeks and she's a steak.  She and her crew, poking around the remains of her father's old laboratory, uncover evidence that whatever he discovered might not have been completely eradicated. Jamie realizes that her real estate adventure may be a tougher sell than she realized.

Okay, yes, this movie is dumb. But if you're picking apart the science in a horror movie, I submit that perhaps you're thinking about it a little too hard. This isn't a movie about science, it's a movie about nasty special effects. Think of it as Slugs for the serial-killer generation. That doesn't totally redeem it, of coursethough one wonders how much it would if Cowan had had the kind of budget that made Alien vs. Predator into one of the best, and yet stupidest, turn-your-brain-off-and-have-fun movies of the past decadebut it's enough to get some enjoyment out of what you're seeing. If you want a creepy-crawly movie, and everything else in your collection you've seen too many times, check this out. Go into it with no expectations and you'll have some fun with it. **",1406246400,,2872,4.647637795275591
