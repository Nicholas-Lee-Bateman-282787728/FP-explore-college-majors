8379043,4,B002S4Q3H0,"I had never seen this show before I bought it on DVD, I bought it on a whim as I was always a fan of ""Three's Company"" ever since I have seen the show in reruns, since it ended before I was born. With this product, I was not disappointed. The episodes are 23-25 minutes along, each episode divided into 2 parts (I assume there were commercials between the 2 parts). There is no captioning, no subtitles, and no bonus features. The set contains 6 discs, six to seven episodes per disc, with episode synopses on the inside covers, which can be a little hard to read just by how they are placed behind where the discs are held in. The transfer is OK, I don't believe it was remastered or anything. To play this, you will need a computer, or region-free/region 2 DVD player. In this original version, the man is named Robin, Chrissy is the brunette, and the blonde is named Jo (that took some getting used to). Many of the episodes from this original version were done in ""Three's Company"". This version has less slap-stick and less physical comedy than ""Three's Company"", but it's still just as funny. It really helps to understand British slang and/or the British accent since there are no subtitles or captioning. I don't like how the show ended, but I read there was a movie and I am sure it would clear up any questions and tie up any loose ends. I would suggest to buy this if you were/are a fan of ""Three's Company"", since it was based on this show, and have something to play the discs on. I HIGHLY recommend buying a region-free DVD player, I bought one online for less than $50. Plus, there are many DVD releases in other countries that are NOT ever released in the US.",1327190400,5,1675,4.389067524115756
