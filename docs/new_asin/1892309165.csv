202206,1,1892309165,This video is just a repeat of images found in Baby Mozart and Baby  Einstein.  I also was surprised and displeased by the violence portrayed in  the video.  My daughter (18 mos) who still enjoys the other two videos  walked away in the frist 5 minutes of watching this.,960336000,5,270,4.428571428571429
202207,5,1892309165,"We own all four of the tapes in the Baby Einstein series and all are terrific, but Baby Shakespeare is the best of all.  It is for a little older child, but it has poetry, more interesting toys to watch, drawings that turn into real objects (like a train, a cow, a flower, etc) and children singing their ABC's.  It also uses more hand puppets and has little funny skits that are adorable.
My two year old son loves all of the Baby Einstein videos, but he asks for this one by name.  My only criticism is that all the children in the video are girls.  A small flaw in an otherwise splendid presentation.",958348800,19,603,4.2631578947368425
202208,4,1892309165,"What's great about Baby Shakespeare?
1. The children singing the ABC song (twice)
2. The format for teaching 12 words: train, flower, apple, cat, grass, frog, leaf, snow, tree, cow, butterfly, moon.  They say the word, then show the word on screen, then say it again, then show a picture of it.  The way they start with a rough sketch and morph into the real thing is also quite interesting.
3. Music by Beethoven
4. The poems have something to do with the words being taught.
5. Lots of cool and colorful toys - the Baby Einstein series really loves toys with figures that climb stairs.
6. Each segment starts with the click of a camera, so you know you're moving on to the next word.
What's not so great about Baby Shakespeare?
1. The actual theatre piece is only 28 minutes long.  The 101 minutes on the jacket includes a concert and poetry recital.  (This is video folks, not an audio cd)
2. Some of the toys are in the wrong places. The ""cat"" segment has footage of a worm in an apple, the ""cow"" segment has a train.
3. The poems are way above the level of the intended audience.  Couldn't they have found children's poems?
I rated this 4 stars because my son loves it, especially the ABC song segments.  I have to wonder though, how poems by Nash, Kinnell, Yeats, Frost and Wordsworth, among others, relate to a monkey with cymbals, and a flatulence joke among cows.
Kids from 1 year old will love the kidstuff, older folk will appreciate the poems, and try to remember the rest of the familiar ones.",1062892800,30,1506,4.438405797101449
202209,5,1892309165,I'm a huge Baby Einstein fan. I bought my daughter Baby Mozart when she was 5 1/2 months and she loved it. Now at 8 1/2 months we own several of theses videos. Baby Shakespeare is her favorite. She enjoys this video so much. Loves Bard. Julie is a genius. Love everything about this video. Put together very well.,1058832000,2,313,4.322033898305085
202210,5,1892309165,"i originally bought this video 'cause my kids love the baby Einstein stuff and I thought this would be similar.  It wasn't.  I thought the video had some good educational info, but it failed in the graphics department.  My 3 year old had a VERY TOUGH time keeping his attention focused on the video. ...",1051747200,,303,4.472727272727273
202211,5,1892309165,"I can't say enough about the Baby Einstein series !  Our baby loves each one !! Just hearing the start of the music and seeing the little pull toy catepillar crawl across the screen is enough to get my little one jumping up and down and excited to see HIS movie !!  Even though this is more talking and prose, it still keeps the baby's attention.  The bright colors and bold images captivate and entertain.  The music is nice..each DVD even has the feature of allowing you to play just the music without the video....great to help lull a fussy baby off to sleep !  We love them and so will you !",1046908800,,595,4.230088495575221
202212,5,1892309165,"I own 3 baby einstein videos now and I have no complaints about any of them. My 14 m/o loves to watch them over and over. This is our newest one and she watched it 3 times in a row! It really keeps her occupied, unlike other videos like 'baby's first video' and 'So Smart Sights and Sounds'. Baby Einstein is the way to go!",1042156800,,323,3.9846153846153847
202213,5,1892309165,"We LOVE this video!  I had seen these before, but they looked so boring.  Then I borrowed one (Baby Bach) from our library and my littlest one (10 months old at the time) was hooked!  My older kids, 3 and 5 year olds, also enjoyed watching it.  I was really amazed.  My 3 year old daughter saw this one in the store and insisted we buy it.  They all 3 love it, esp. spunky little Bard.  My youngest will go in and out of the room during this one (it is more for preschoolers) but she makes sure to come back in when Bard is on-screen.  I do not let my kids watch much TV, but the music is wonderful to hear and it is a healthy form of entertainment in my opinion.  I wish I had had some of these when my older two were babies.  Even so, they all recognize the music when they hear it in other contexts and they all will sit and watch this - with varying ages, that's not always easy!
My husband was amazed the first time he saw my baby watch it, completely mesmerized, when a few minutes earlier she had been screaming!  I would recommend these to anyone, and am giving several as gifts this year!",1039996800,,1097,4.055813953488372
202214,5,1892309165,"My son is 10 months old and is absolutely in love with this tape.  The puppets, sound effects and lively music keep him entertained.  I love the idea that they are teaching words, and using poetry to do so.  Th only thing I could possibly say in a negative vein, is that Julie Clark's voice can become a little grating.  (Think Ginger on Gilligan's Island.)  That said , it is still well worth the price.",1039824000,,404,4.333333333333333
202215,3,1892309165,"It's tough to live up to the standard set by Baby Mozart, which many people acknowledge is the best video in this series, and I agree.  I think one issue is that it seems that music and still or moving images go well together.  That creates a natural rhythm to Baby Mozart.  The ""flow"" of Baby Shakespeare (aimed at a slightly higher age range) is not as smooth, as I think it is challenging to mesh words and poetry with music.  That said, Shakespeare is still very entertaining for both of our kids (2 years old and 8 months old).  Some of the same techniques and similar props are used in each, but I think that redundancy is lost on the children.  Our older child likes the puppets and real-world images.  Our younger one seems to enjoy the props a little more.  Educationally, Mozart definitely goes after the creative side of the brain while Shakespeare tries to stimulate intellect a little more.  But frankly, a dozen words isn't gonna cut it, even for our 8 month old, who likely already knows dozens of words, even if she can't verbalize any of them yet.  Same with the alphabet - my two-year old knows his alphabet cold and my 8 month old will need to hear more than the alphabet song in order to really grasp that concept.  So, buy this video for the entertainment value, but I wouldn't consider it to be an effective educational tool.",1036195200,,1347,4.457142857142857
202216,5,1892309165,"As one who strongly supports reading to children, I was a ""little"" anti-TV for my youngster, until watching ""Baby Van Gogh,"" which is another video produced by the same company.  Julie Aigner-Clark is a genius!  Her innovative products, exceptionally creative, are designed to entertain children while they learn.  ""Baby Shakespeare,"" is no exception.  With an imaginative approach, this instantly engaging video teaches language (12 words) through cleverly written text, and real world objects, while stimulating auditory senses with classically arranged musical pieces.  My son was immediately mesmerized from the first viewing, two-months old, and remains fascinated to this day, now fourteen months old.
I heard about Baby Einstein products from friends, but did not become interested until I learned of the company's dedication to providing financial support to MANY children's charities such as the Autism Society of America, Ronald McDonald House, The Eden Institute, a leading school for educating autistic children, and a host of other organizations committed to children with special needs.  I now own several Baby Einstein videos and most of the companion books - they are excellent educational tools.
Additional recommendations - ""Baby Mozart,"" ""Baby Van Gogh,"" ""Baby Dolittle Neighborhood Animals,"" also, Richard Scarry's ""BEST"" videos are excellent for children 1 year and up.",1026864000,60,1390,5.690821256038648
202217,5,1892309165,"I bought this video because my sister-in-law bought Baby Motzart for her son and it kept him occupied during trips.  Once I started the video my daughter was hooked.  I recomend that everyone gets one of these videos for their child, or as a gift!!!",1026172800,,249,4.511111111111111
202218,5,1892309165,"The whole concept of mixing classical literature with fun music is great.  I liked the way the video would key in on a word and then expound upon it by presenting a piece of literature that contains it.  The best part about the whole video is that it is FUN to watch...and FUNNY, too!  My son loves Bard and laughs at his every move.",1019260800,,333,4.171875
202219,1,1892309165,"I just don't think that entertainment should be so abstract.
There is only one poem from Shakespeare, all of the poems are way over the head of the age group targeted, and it's really not teaching anything.  If you are to choose one video from Baby Einstein, it should be Baby Mozart, and only if you want it for very young infants.  Otherwise, it is only good for slowing down a baby's heart rate and putting them to sleep.  Exactly what mothers don't need in the 21st century.  Better to search for edu-tainment series that engage our babies and encourage them to participate with the video and learn something for the time they spend watching TV.  I believe that this video is a waist of money and a loss of energy.  Ms. Clarks voice is a bit submissive, not empowering.  I also find the puppets to be scary, and the casting is not only not diverse, but doesn't includ any boys.  It's clear that Ms. Clark has put money making and marketing before the best interest of our children and lacks creative and new ideas.  Children may watch these videos, and they may enjoy them, but that doesn't make them worthwhile entertainment.",1011484800,11,1130,4.554455445544554
202220,1,1892309165,"There are better things you could spend your money on.  Like a real classical music cd which you put into your own stereo and act out with your child.  I was so sorry we invested our money into something I could have created myself.  Maybe if I had paid...  like most videos of this quality cost, I wouldn't be so negative but the cost of this set was way overpriced on the good.  Pick up some puppets and interact with your child yourself.  Buy some flashcards if you wish as well.  Your child will enjoy that time more than having some faceless voice speaking to them on TV.  They stare enough at the boob tube as it is.
This won't make your child smarter.  Only the parent themselves can do that by encouraging their kids to actively learn, by reading to them and being very involved in their children's schooling years.",1010620800,4,823,4.397350993377484
202221,3,1892309165,"While still absolutely captivating to my 18 month and 3 yr old This one is my least favorite of the otherwise amazing line of Videos. One questionable scene has a purple cow ""Farting"" !!While I guess this is the funny thing to kids now a days (ie.  the stuff you see on Nickelodeon in the evenings) I still think this was a surprisingly poor judgement in taste when you consider the proposed audience. I'm trying to teach them manners for crying out loud! I suggest an edited version on the next run.
Other than that It's still incredible the appeal of these videos. I've even examined it frame by frame just to see if there some subliminal messaging going on to put my kids into such a state of joy whenever I put it on! Anthony, my 18 month yearold
shouts Baby Ba! Baby Ba! ( Baby Bach ) in a near crazed state at the same time before bed and  tries to climb the shelf to get the DVDs! Vincent, the 3 yr old still loves them even though he's watched the same ones literally hundreds of times over the past couple of years. Needless to say we have the whole set. A safe bet for your little ones too!",1007078400,6,1100,4.208530805687204
202222,5,1892309165,"My 2 year old absolutely loves this video!  She asks for it by calling it the ""Dragon"" video and she loves the main character, Bard.  It is full of goofy toddler fun and jokes and she laughs through it every time, and anticipates the parts she thinks are funniest.  She says, ""Look, look mommy!"" and then eagerly watches for my reaction as she is cracking up at the snow falling on Bard's head, or some other silliness.  We have a video player and screen in our car, and the player has a headset so we don't have to hear the videos.  This video makes her laugh in her car seat, just like in the minivan ads and her sweet laughter makes us so happy, especially on long trips!  She would watch this video over and over if we'd let her.  Also, my version came with the music CD and not the book.  I always play her music when she plays inside and I was surprised that she knew the music apart from the video when she heard it; she told me it was the Dragon music and was very happy to hear it.  I have an 8 month old who likes watching this video with his sister, but I think he gets more of a kick out of watching and hearing his sister's enjoyment than the tv.  I highly recommend this video!  I have the Baby Einstein too, but the reaction from this one was by far better than most of her other videos.",1002585600,3,1302,4.086614173228346
202223,5,1892309165,My son loves it as much at 2 as he did at 6 mos. Julie's DVD's are one of the few he'll watch entirely. And I'm not tired of it either!,1002499200,,135,3.3870967741935485

202225,4,1892309165,"This is the most professional production of the entire video series. The puppet, Bard, is an absolute delight!! My son fell in love with him and laughs everytime he watches this video. My only negative comment is that [they] should have hired a professional voice artist for the video. [the] voice lacks ""umph"" and is boring. Bard is what kept my son mesmorized.",975196800,2,362,4.761904761904762
202226,4,1892309165,"I'd bet that a lot of would-be buyers are scared off by the title, wondering if their 1-year old is quite ready for King Lear.  Actually the  readings are derived from a variety of poets most of whom employ crisp  imagery and generally easy-to-grasp similes that make one (parents and  older kids) see things in a new way.  The pacing of this video is perhaps  more leisurely than Baby Mozart, more contemplative.  There are still the  usual group of puppets and toys however as well as some semi-violent  slapstick that some parents might find objectionable ( I did not).  Initially our 16-month old was bothered by the photographic sequences of  real-life snow, flora and fauna, preferring the video sequences of toys  against blank backdrops.  However, the video does a wonderful job of  creating transitions between drawings of real world objects and  photographs.  The first gradually morphs into the second.  Now he is very  enthusiastic about the video as a whole.  I would recommend this video as a  followup to Baby Mozart and Baby Bach (the latter of which is good, but I  would agree that it is the weakest of the group.)",968716800,10,1132,4.791666666666667

His favorites are Baby Shakespeare, Baby McDonald, Numbers Nursery, and Baby VanGogh--i.e., all the classical puppet format types. Baby Shakespeare has beautiful imagery and poetry, but also the fun puppets my little guy loves to see.  I've researched the BE series thoroughly, and highly recommend these. While I am not crazy enough to think the videos will make my baby smarter, I do like that I know what he's seeing, I get a few minutes to shower, cook, etc, and most importantly, he loves them!",1200787200,,568,4.68

7801048,4,1892309165,"This video entertains my 16-month-old son without fail, and has for the six months we've owned it. He's seen Baby Van Gogh, Baby Galileo, and Baby Neptune, as well as cartoons and other child-directed video; this remains his favorite.

 In brief, it consists mostly of vignettes featuring child-friendly themes such as trains and butterflies, with pictures and poems about each subject drawn from Shakespeare, Ogden Nash, William Wordsworth, W.B. Yeats, and others; these are interspersed with footage of mobile toys with Beethoven's music played behind (performed by a small ensemble featuring piano, guitar, drums, vibes, etc.) and quick shots of kids doing things like singing the ABC song. The gentle, quiet images and music--the other videos mentioned above are busier--seem to connect best with him in his generally calm household (and with his verbal parents).

 I recommend it with only a couple reservations, and they're contextual. First, one can argue that the very young shouldn't get a lot of TV exposure, and I won't argue against that. Secondly, I can't swear that Alex is taking away a lot from this, only that he finds it more engaging than any other TV/video he sees, and we believe its content is wholesome and harmless... and that's what we ask of it.

 Other Baby Einstein reviewers have ranted that the videos are ""baby crack"": mesmerizing, risking the creation of ADHD-speed attention spans, and indoctrinating about toy products. I think that's catastrophizing. My son watches this easily because it's colorful, simple, and has toys and kids in it--the things that interest him--without a lot of frenzy; he gets bored with cartoons or Sesame Street, but not this.

 As other reviewers say: Maybe its greatest value is in holding little attentions for a half hour without damaging them, so bathroom or household tasks can be knocked out without howls and pleas for attention. It accomplishes this without turning Alex into a zombie, and he's always impressed that I know the ABC song or Julie's opening poem about the main character. Don't ask it to educate your child or babysit beyond one-showing's length, and I think you'll be happy (and mostly guilt-free) that it's in your house.",1089331200,19,2208,5.096952908587258
7801049,5,1892309165,"This was once my daughter's favorite video.  Now it is fast becoming a favorite of my son's.  It is called Baby Shakespeare but there are only a few lines of his used.  This is similar to Baby Mozart with its footage of toys in motion and classical music, but this one has added poetry to the mix.
The video is broken into segments.  Each segment begins with an opening curtain, a toy camera, and a word.  The word is shown and a poem about the word is used.  The poems are really not for children (especially the snow poem which is probably above many adult heads).  There is then plenty of footage of toys in motion.  The segments vary in length (Cat is really short).  The segments then end with a closing curtain.
The credits attribute the music to Beethoven but there are at least two pieces using Mozart.  This one also uses more in the way of puppets, especially Bard the dragon (he's on the cover of the box).
As a lover of classical music, I find this video far less annoying after numerous repetitions than many other children's videos.  Just remember to turn this one off before the ending credits.  After the sleepy final segment (Moon) hopefully lulls your child to sleep, the credits jump in with a rousing Ode to Joy.",1080518400,10,1232,4.450892857142857
