I am very happy, and would definitely do business with this seller again.",1373500800,,248,3.8823529411764706
8261627,5,B00168H8EQ,"This is a great mystery with an intelligent story line but the real pleasure is the cast.  Gene Wilder -- wonderfual.  Each of the others terrific. The setting, cars and clothing are almost as good as the history lesson. And it's fun.  I highly recommend it for those of us sick of 12 year old mentality TV.",1308009600,,307,4.350877192982456
