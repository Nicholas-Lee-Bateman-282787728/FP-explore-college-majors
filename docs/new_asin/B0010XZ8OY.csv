8239385,5,B0010XZ8OY,This was a great DVD. You obviously have to watch for more than 3 minutes. It's based on the bible...not an opinion.,1322352000,,116,4.318181818181818
8239386,1,B0010XZ8OY,"3 Disks set of lecture in some conference room or so. There is no graphic no music nothing in support to make it interesting for watching. Instead this one man who is actually a public school science teacher trying to beat the science referring to Bible. And so 4 hours. I even did not start to watch. I turned it off after 3 minutes of watching the first part. I do not like when someone build theory on fairy tale as a Bible which in fact was modified 24 time since original one. I am opened mind one. It just there is boring science but based on facts and I respect that. But his lecture I'm not interested in. I learned enough to build my own theory. But I would not start to sell it if I would not have solid science proof. there is a lot of more interesting other facts and documentaries lets say for example ""Reality UFO Series"" - presents the documentary in the boring way  but at least it based on facts such as alien implants in humans. Dr. Roger Leir a surgeon, claims to have removed at least ten alien implants from humans since 1995. He does not talking quoting Bible he shows his practical work.
Unfortunately ""Scientific Fingerprints of God"" is not scientific.",1254268800,,1176,4.36986301369863
