645331,2,6303454038,"I gotta come right out and say it: Jar Jar ruined the whole movie.  The long stretches of exposition, the sluggish pace of the movie (really, this is the slowest and least captivating of the star wars films), the  ""cute kid"", the blatantly ""Yellow Peril""  Chinese-archetype aliens, and unbelievably CHEESY revelation that ""the  Force"" is genetic... All of these things I could have dealt with and  had a good enough time for my money (and patience in line), but every time  that-frog thing is in the movie (and that's a lot!) I was just shaking my  head in disbelief.  Why? Why does it have to be this way?  The good things:  Ewan McGregor was an awesome young Obi-Wan, Liam Neeson carried himself as  always with dignity-even when pretending to scold a stupid Roger Rabbit  wannabe, and the fight with Darth Maul at the end has to be the best reason  to watch.  So all in all, I'm still looking forward to the next movie, but  this definitly is not going to be as worn out as my tape of the original  Star Wars, if I even decide to get it at all.

645592,2,6303454038,"Oh, boy! Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace(1999) is loaded with eye candy and action, but very little story. The music composed by John Williams is really good. Duel of the Fates sounds great at Star Wars in Concert. In Mad Magazine, you can see a drawing of Obi Wan cutting Jar Jar Binks' head off. They jokingly called Star Wars Episode II ""A Galaxy Rejoices""! I had a VHS copy of The Phantom Menace. Pictures came and broke your heart; my Phantom Menace copy WAS EATEN BY A VTR! The visual effects by ILM are good. Ray Park was good as Darth Maul. He also played a Lucasfilm security guard in Fanboys(2009). The Phantom Menace was released in 3-D in the Spring of 2012. The guy in row 12 can sit under the shadow of Anakin's pod racer. If you want a better Star Wars prequel, watch Rogue One A Star Wars Story(2016).",1521763200,,824,4.32258064516129

645735,3,6303454038,"I most enjoyed the characters Qui Gon and Obi-wan, as well as Padme and Palpatine. Anakin was cute, and I enjoyed his role in a way, although he just didn't have the gravity of character that you want based on how they talk about his future, etc. The parts I disliked were the gungans (Jar Jar was way overkill), the Trade federation dudes, and the fact that the character Darth Maul was one of the most non-character characters I've ever seen. He had a look, but that was it. I don't even think he spoke once. The most emotional thing he did in the entire movie was kick Obi-wan's lightsaber over a ledge.

The plot worked in a way, but it was kind of like a kid's novel in which the stupidest and most inexperienced characters somehow accidentally save the day. The whole movie felt very lighthearted and geared towards children. It's not unbearable to watch, but that's especially when you decide to forget its connection to Star Wars. It literally felt weird and disconnected when the end credits and the theme music came on, like I forgot I'd been watching a Star Wars movie.

645897,3,6303454038,"If I'm being completely honest, I was taken back when I saw this film opening weekend.. It neither carried the ""wow"" factor in effects nor the whimsical charm of characters and story as the original series did. In fact the film as a whole felt very foreign to me in trying to make the association with Star Wars as I knew it. The only thing I DID like was Darth Maul and he was cut down before I had a chance to really know him. I thought that fight scene was done very well and time has only made me appreciate that sequence even more. In terms of casting and charcters this is how they felt then and how they look now:

Anakin ( Jake Lloyd) - Personally I felt like Lucas overstated the innocence and cuteness factor of this character, which ultimately oversold the effect of being a charming boy and being more of a irritable one. The one thing Lucas is not good at is subtext in characters. He doesn't seem to know how to let these characters breath on their own without carrying big signs saying, "" I'm the funny one"" or "" I'm the cute one"", or ""I'm the mean one."" There's too much hand holding with the audience that is unnecessary and so the effect comes off feeling very mechanical in the character building aspect of the story. Today I have gotten use to these qualities but it really only underscores how much better a different actor might have been in such a critical role. He still looks and acts like he should be building a dog house for Lassie instead of creating a droid.

Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) - I never felt Neeson was right for this role. He seem to be lost in the character. He spoke the lines but never gave them any feeling that made me believe HE believed what he was saying. So his character was kind of a token mentor for Obi-Wan and nothing more. This would not be the last character to be poorly cast in my humble opinion. Today I still carry those reserves about Neesom but with less conviction. Not because I see it it better but, like Jake Lloyd, I'm just accustom to it.

Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) - Talk about a critical casting part that Lucas nailed perfectly. Ewan is superb as Obi-Wan and absolutely brings a believable and meaningful performance to the part. He does so much with very little in terms of dialogue, which kind of underscores why the originals worked so well. As an actor he knew how to milk every line and give resonance to every important moment in the Anakin/Obi-Wan story arc. Today I only praise him more when I see this part. So tragic he could be so good while surrounded by those not so good.

Padme' (Natalie Portman) - Natalie is an excellent actress and I think she brought as much emotion as she could to her part. She definitely carried the emotional emphasis to her role as well as cGregor. Today the only difference I see is Lucas never gave her much to do in this story. She was wasted talent in this installment. She is definitely a high note though in retrospect.

Mace Windu ( Samuel Jackson) - Truly one of the worst WTF moments in casting history. Jackson no more fit the part of a Jedi Knight than Clint Eastwood would be as Santa Claus. His rhythms are entirely too urban in dialect and delivery to approach this kind of dialogue that is decidedly stilted and colonial in style. He just doesn't fit in any of these scenes. Today his presence only takes me out of the story and allows me time to consider a parody worthy of every scene he's in. And make no mistake. Samuel Jackson is a great actor. But he plays his parts from a very primal and emotional gut level. This character was very superficial and his presence felt like a token tip of the hat than a meaningful contribution in the story.

Darth Maul (Ray Park) - I can say with complete honesty if this character was not in the film and played so effectively by Ray Park, I would probably not watch this movie again in my lifetime. He's the one actor that offers that old Star Wars mystique to his character. When I see Darth Maul I get that old tingle in my gut that says this is Star Wars. His character carries a passion and focus that resonates through the film. In his makeup and outfit, that could have been played so badly for camp. But instead Park's performance makes Darth Maul one of the great moments in Star Wars history. For me he saves this film. A darn shame Lucas didn't find more potential in him.

Effects and CGI characters: I think the stated issues with many of these characters is well documented and universally agreed upon. Jar jar is a complete miss. I have no idea what Lucas was thinking. Yoda looks nearly crossed eyed in his depiction and the additional characters cater to social stereotypes that don't service this story well. Now I'm not a PC guy by any means. I don't walk around getting ""offended' by every little characterization people offer to a story or something as basic as a conversation. But in this film Lucas seems to just lean on stereotypes to build his characters without giving them any real charm that is needed to bring them to life. So the final analysis only gives you the stereotype to consider. So we have the black guy, the Jewish guy, the Chinese guy and on and on. There's nothing about those characters that tells me they are there except to role play those stereotypes and that's pretty one dimensional for someone I expect more from like Lucas.

So what really holds this film together is Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, and Ray Parker. Without those actors, we have nothing to watch here. So while Phantom Menace is not a film I put in often, I CAN watch it with an understanding that Lucas was trying to do some things different and while many things strayed from the level of consistency people like me were use to getting from Lucas, I can say when he was spot on, he was REALLY spot on. Without question I think the intent was better served than what Disney does today. So that context alone makes this movie redeemable.",1514419200,2,5917,4.422018348623853

646110,2,6303454038,"Star Wars I goes waay back in time to when Obi-Wan Kenobi was a young apprentice to master jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn.  We also meet Anakin Skywalker as an adorable little boy.  Anakin Skywalker eventually becomes Luke Skywalker's father and.. you know who.. (the guy with the breathing problems in the dark mask??)  We meet him when he is still 'good' and impressionable.  The film begins with the planet of Naboo, which is being illegally blockaded by another political body called the Federation.  The Republic has sent Obi Wan and Qui-Gon Jinn to negotiate between the Queen of Naboo and the Federation agents- basically, they are being sent to tell the Federation to end the blockade.  We are introduced to the Sith Lords, whom the Jedi had believed were long extinct.  During the fighting that ensues between the Federation drones and the Queen's forces, we also learn that little Anakin Skywalker has more 'Midi-chlorians' than any jedi before him- including the great Yoda.  For this reason, Qui-Gon Jinn is convinced that Anakin is 'The One' prophesied from the beginning to bring 'balance' to the Force and thus, save everyone from destruction.  (He is convinced that Anakin is the 'Savior') This is the first Star Wars episode introducing the 'Midi-chlorian' concept.  They are an intelligent microscopic life form that lives symbiotically inside the cells of all living things. When present in sufficient numbers, they allow their host to detect the pervasive energy field known as the Force.  (So, any notion that The Force is God vs. Satan are shot down in this episode.)  The surprising part is that little Anakin appears to have been the product of an Immaculate Conception!  His mother just 'got pregnant' somehow by these mid-chlorians and pow! the legend of the 'Savior' came into fruition.  (Why can't writers keep their hands off the Christ story?)  (We later find out that the Sith Lords found a way to manipulate the Midi-chlorians to both extend their own lives indefinitely and to produce life itself- as they did with Anakin Skywalker.)  For this reason, the council of Jedi Masters reject little Anakin as a jedi.  However, in defiance, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan both swear to train him as their personal apprentice.  We all know how that went, right?

The storyline was fine and answered some long time questions about the Force and Darth Vader.  No complaints there.  The costumes, excellent, the acting was great.  But the one problem that just ruined the film was the animation- especially the backgrounds.  It was SO BAD that it absolutely ruined most scenes for me.  I could see fuzzy outlines around the characters so they appeared to be floating on the fake backdrops.  Some of the characters were animated and they were extremely mediocre.  I truly wish they had just made it more 'in the real world' than in the computer.  I eventually lost all interest in the film and found myself clipping my toenails and sanding my fingernails as I listened to the end of the movie.  No lie there.  Make your own conclusions.

This has all been said before by thousands of others, but...
This has nowhere near the magic of the originals. The story and dialogue is stilted and hokey. The special effects are early CGI and stand out like a sore thumb. It would have been better off with the stop-motion of the original. It has value to movie buffs and historians as an example of the development of CGI in film, but merely for a viewing experience, it's pretty bad. Remember the ""Ewok Movie"" from the '80's? This is about as good as that. There are some highpoints, such as the lightsaber battle between young Obiwan, his mentor Quigon, and the bad guy of the movie, Darth Maul - but otherwise, it's obviously written with 8-year-olds in mind as the primary audience. Which is incredibly sad that he wrote down to what he thought was a child's level for this. I was eight when the original came out, and I thought it was awesome. You don't have to treat kids like they're stupid and simple. This is the ""Disney-fied"" version of Star Wars - not that Disney is bad, but turning it into the equivalent of a standard '90's Disney animated film pretty much ruins the vibe that the originals had.",1496275200,4,1302,4.429166666666666

A generation later we got the prequels, and the little kid in me got excited. Lucas was coming back to Star Wars. Man I wish he hadn't, as these new installments just didn't have it. Lucas has directed, produced and/or created some great films: Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Empire Strikes Back, but he has also produced some real lemons: Howard the Duck, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Unfortunately, The Phantom Menace fits comfortably in this later category.

646581,3,6303454038,"I'm not sure why this movie gets so many negative reviews and opinions.  Granted, it is not as strong as Revenge of the Sith, easily the best of the prequels, and nowhere near as good as Empire Strikes Back, but this movie has a lot to commend it.  First the bad:  Anakin as a little kid...Jar Jar Binks...the interminable and really useless podrace (one can fast forward through the entire race and miss absolutely nothing in terms of plot or even character development).  On these counts, one can justly ask: ""What was Lucas thinking?!"".

But then there is the good:  Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn...a young and impetuous Obi-Wan, played by the great Euan McGregor...Coruscant...""Senator"" Palpatine's rise to power...the first exposure to the Jedi Council...Darth Maul...Terence Stamp as Chancellor Valorum...

But, what I think is the topper and why this movie has always had a higher place in my mind is that, for the very first time, we get to actually see what Jedi truly were.  We get repeated insinuations in the original trilogy, but based on what little we see, there is always the wonder of how these people could have been ""guardians of peace and justice"" in the Old Republic.  Obi-Wan was tired and his power seemed limited to mind tricks; Yoda could lift an X-Wing, but spent most of his time being given piggyback rides around the swamp.  Luke could jump really far and choke green pig men.  Was that all there was to being a Jedi?

And then, in this movie, we see Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan take on a battalion of battle droids; use preternatural speed and a variety of Force powers.  Then the epic lightsaber battle in the final minutes of the movie. Indeed, the brief battle between Maul and Obi-Wan, when Obi-Wan literally explodes at Maul, is incredible and ranks among my top 3 lightsaber battles of all time.  Qui-Gon, in the midst of battle, pauses to meditate and reflect, entering more deeply into the Force.  In these ways, we get a glimpse of who the Jedi really were, and their power is awesome to behold - everything that we were led to believe.

Yes, the plot is a bit weak, and yes some of the characters are obnoxious beyond words.  But, there is still a great deal here.  In addition to all of this, the talents of Liam Neeson, Euan McGregor, and Ian McDiarmid lend gravitas, humor, and a dark sense of foreboding to the proceedings.

This is not the greatest Star Wars movie of all time, that much is true.  But it is far better than its harshest critics will claim, and it is well worth another look.",1482969600,,2526,4.621076233183857

647107,3,6303454038,"There are some good parts of this movie. The special effects and the sound effects and the music are pretty good. Some of the critters are imaginative, if implausible.

 Script is mediocre and the plot line is about as implausible As It Gets. The force is reduced to some parasites living in our cells. Android armies that ought to be all but invincible are fought to the death by untrained security volunteers as they are referred to. The death fight between the Sith Lord Apprentice and the Jedi Knights can't even be described as interesting, it is more of a dance than a fight.

 After the first three movies I expected something at least as good butt it just wasn't to be. It was good enough to watch but I probably won't watch it again. Hopefully the next one in the series will be better.",1474675200,,795,4.462068965517242

More like a high school drama club with a $100 million dollar budget than the classic space opera it ought to have been. The lead actors sound like they have no previous experience.

There was so much answered in all three prequels, that said, the first, ""The Phantom Menace"" was absolutely terrible.  I liked the introduction of Qui Gon and Obi-Wan's relationship, the light saber duels, getting a better understanding of Palpatine's rise to power, and the introduction of Padme and Anakin.  I did not like the Jar Jar Binks character at all, that whole plot with Jar Jar and the Gungan was ridiculous and childish. I really felt like I was watching a kids movie.  I also think that the Darth Maul character could have been developed more.  All in all, I'm glad I watched it, but after one viewing, it is not something I would watch again.",1472342400,2,825,4.734265734265734

You can just listen to - or for that matter just read the lyrics of - Weird Al Yankovic's ""The Saga Begins"" and you have seen the movie. Besides impressive special effects and good acting from a stellar cast there is nothing to see here people, move along. I say good acting because it is not the cast's fault they were given mundane dialogue and thus portrayed characters I just did not care about. The only interesting idea brought up here not brought up in the original trilogy is that fear in sufficient amounts is necessary for survival, but in excess it can destroy a person. And that it is possible for a nine year old boy to hit on a fourteen year old girl and have a shot AFTER puberty. That's it, that's all. It's not a menace, but this film is definitely a phantom of the first two Star Wars films and maybe even of the third, which was also a step down in quality in my humble opinion.",1468022400,,988,4.205263157894737

The unfortunate part is the acting of the characters is to be desired, and hearing the future Darth Vader say yippee several times throughout the movie was annoying and forced, as if we were supposed to be reminded that the future terrifying Darth Vader was once a bright-eyed innocent boy. I got that pretty clearly, without all of the yippees! Killing off the apprentice of the future emperor so quickly never gave the character a chance to develop, maybe wait until the second movie unless you want everyone to think the apprentice is actually that weak that he can't survive the only major duel with a Jedi.",1463961600,,674,4.6722689075630255

The story suffers greatly from the lack of likable characters with Qui-Gon being mostly wooden and unnecessary and Obi Wan being underutilized.  Anakin being a slave boy and much younger than Obi-Wan missed a great opportunity to establish their friendship and description that was defined in Episode IV.  Lucas seemed to try and get all of his characters into the fold right down to actually having Anakin build C3P0 and R2D2 saving a Naboo ship.  The Gungan characters didn't work especially Jar Jar.  The main antagonist is killed at the end instead of living to fight another day. Samuel L Jackson is invisible on screen and that's and hard thing to accomplish.  So most of the movie didn't work.

Set thirty years before the original film, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Episode I introduces young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), the wise old Jedi from the original series, who is a young apprentice himself. It is a time before the Empire when democracy reigned over the Galaxy in the Galactic Republic and when the Jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice.

However, when the greedy Trade Federation invades the planet of Naboo, two Jedi knights, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi, are sent to settle the conflict. They join up with the queen of Naboo, Amidala (Natalie Portman), and Anakin Skywalker to take back the planet and fight a deadly menace lurking in the shadows - an evil Sith known as Darth Maul.

An exciting and emotional action-packed adventure with great special effects, great characters, great performances, and a lot of suspenseful and well-staged action sequences. A great entry in the Star Wars saga, and a great first episode in the prequel trilogy!

This by the way is the first SW episode lacking the projection of a ""beat up/worn out future."" What I mean here is 90% of the characters wear brand new costumes - it is so unrealistic and so ""non-Star-Wars."" Also, this is the most cartoonish SW episode.

649902,5,6303454038,"After waiting a really long 16 years since Jedi it was a real treat to finally begin to find out the back stories for both Anakin Skywalker before he becomes Darth Vader and the Clone Wars.  I saw the previews for this movie many times and was all aflutter with excitement.  Well after seeing it in theatres on my birthday back in 1999, I was beside myself with elation.  In this review, as I assume that everyone who's into Star Wars such as myself already knows the storyline to this one I'll just go into what was great about it.

In this chapter it was really something special to be introduced to the following characters:  Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, his apprentice Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi(when he was much younger), clumsy Gungan Jar Jar Binks, beautiful Queen Padme' Amidala, Mace Windu, Sith Lord Darth Maul, and Anakin Skywalker when he was a little boy.

All of the chief characters offered much in the way of likability, relatability, charm, and they all proved to be quite interesting.  Jar Jar Binks proved quite funny as well.  Darth Maul has a cool look and is quite unrelenting in both his pure evil and totally menacing sides.

The acting was nothing short of excellent.  Especially Natalie Portman's and Jake Lloyd's performances.  Everybody in this movie's acting was convincing, gripping, in character, and above all flawless.  The chemistry between Anakin and Qui-Gon, Anakin and his mother Shmi, Anakin and Padme', and Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan truly make this movie as well.  The character development was thoroughly handled also.

I really enjoyed the Pod race scene.  It was exciting, fun to watch, very original, filled with action, and nerve-racking, but in a good way.  The whole conflict of Anakin not only racing his rival the cold calculatingly evil racer and saboteur Sebulba as well as Anakin's need to win so that he can be freed from slavery make this segment of this movie one unquestionably exciting nail biter.

Our first introductions to a not yet fully built C-3PO and a fully built R2-D2 was a good part of this movie also.  The earlier days of Yoda was something to note as well.

The special effects for the space dog fights, the spaceships, the light sabres, the droids and robots, the aliens, the pod racing vehicles, the holograms, and the planets were nothing short of top notch.  It was also cool to see what the heroes and the villains spaceships back at that time were like.  You even get to see the original T.I.E. Fighters.

I really enjoyed to beautifully developed detailed atmospheres of the planets.  There's plenty of scenery to be taken in for every planet that's used in this movie.  The planets includes Naboo, Coruscant, Tatooine, and my most favorite, the underwater city of Gungan City.  I know that Gungan City is actually within a planet but still.  The parallels between the dangers underwater and on dry land is certainly well portrayed.

The costumes and the colors for them are shear genius.  There are some clear and present foreign influence such as Asian used for the wardrobes.

The light sabre fight involving Obi Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn vs. Darth Maul was one tremendous fast and furious adrenaline rush.  Also the fight choreography was nothing short of brilliant.

John Williams's score proved nothing short of his usual brilliance.  He truly upped his game with his recognizable sort of tune lending itself to a fresh new sort of sound with more people vocalizing Sanscrit included.  His score brings you more into the feel of the action scenes, the happy scenes, contemplative scenes, etc.

There were also some very entertaining scenes of western-like shoot outs between Queen Amidala, her body guards, and the Trade Confederation battle droids.

Nothing beats the point in the movie where little Anakin or Ani flies in a spaceship and saves the day.  One of many things that comedic parodist ""Weird Al Yankovic"" points out quite cleverly in his funny song ""The Saga Begins"".

Overall, every time I watch this movie I feel a sense of awe, inspiration that it offers, a thrilled feeling of continuation to the saga, a thorough enjoyment of the action sequences, characters that show a lot of charm, likability, development, and relatability.  Also I feel like a kid again just as I do with the original trilogy of episodes 4-6.  This chapter is a definite must in my book.",1451865600,3,4345,4.836043360433604

649904,4,6303454038,"After seeing the highly disappointing ""Force Awakens"" I had to give Episode I another viewing, and I have to give George Lucas more credit than I did earlier. For a prequel film to his earlier series this really isn't all that bad and actually tells a fairly satisfying story. Yes, the excessive CGI and Jar Jar nonsense was distracting, but all things considered there's a lot of good content here, particularly some of the acting and John Williams' music, which is one of his finest. What's particularly notable is Liam Neeson's portrayal of Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn. While the ""Force Awakens"" had shallow characters like Finn and Poe, Lucas really presented a fantastic, convincing lead character who really held your interest, that you believed in, that successfully drove the narrative and that, truth be told, you really morn his loss by the end of the film (knowing that the best actor of the prequels wouldn't be seen again.)

The flow and pacing of Phantom Menace is good, and there isn't too much of the annoyances (such as Jar Jar and Anakin boy) to really distract that badly. On rewatching you just tune that stuff out and follow the thread of the narrative. As mentioned above this is a fantastic soundtrack by John Williams with very emotional, convincing material that really help build scenes that would otherwise be sappy, such as Qui-Gon and Anakin's mom talking about the perils of pod racing. This is also a easy to follow introductory film for those who have never seen any of the films.

It's not perfect but it is an entertaining family film. Minimal violence, mostly cartoony and involving CGI characters, and little else to make it any stronger than a PG.",1451433600,,1681,4.813148788927336

649992,1,6303454038,"The Phantom Menace oh where to begin.  I saw this film in the movie theater when it first came out.  The hype and buildup for the film was probably the biggest of any opening movie in film history.  Coming out of the movie theater I thought to myself that STAR WARS The Phantom Menace was a spectacular failure.  The Phantom Menace was not just bad, it was horribly bad.  Our local paper gave it 2 stars and I thought that was too generous.

Right off the bat the movie just seems off base even down to the opening scrolling monologue something something trade federation blah blah blah.  It might have been better to start the movie off  showing widespread corruption in the senate and backdoor deals, blackmail, extortion, abuse of power, lack of justice, overconfidence of the Jedi etc etc.  The film would have been better off focusing on starting with Coruscant, how the time was ripe for Palpatine to come into power.  Rather than a simple trade dispute that amounted to absolutely nothing on Naboo.

The trade federation aliens speaking English instead of just using their own language with subtitles on screen.  Come on George the kids can learn to read they are not that stupid.  That is just lazy film making.

My main points for hating this film are

1) Choosing a young child over a teenager for the lead role.

Now a lot of people just place the blame on old Jar Jar Binks and say that is why the film sucked.  But for my money it is on the little kid Jake Loyld playing Anakin Skywalker.  Now it is not all Lloyds fault it lies with the fact that Lucas did not start out the role as a middle teenager instead of a young grade school kid.  Little Annie shows almost no fear or aggression at all in the whole movie.  He is just a baby faced little boy without a care in the world.  How on Earth does Yoda see great danger in this little brat who just gets in the way most of the time.  The kid is just awful and every scene the child is in feels ridiculous and forced.  With such groundbreaking movie lines such as Its working Its working, and This is pod racing I cringe still thinking about it now.  Did anybody question George on any of the script dialogue or movie lines?  Watching little Annie pod race was stupid.  Kind of like having a kid trying to drive a car who cannot even reach the pedals.  Once again goes back to the point of why cast a kid and try to make us believe he is a great pilot.  The kid is barely out of diapers makes zero sense to show him as a star fighter pilot.  I kept thinking to myself why didn't George Lucas just start out with a teenager at 16 years old for the first film then 19 for the second movie and 22 for the final movie as a full adult.

A much better choice for the young Anakin role would have been Haley Joel Osment from the 6th Sense movie.  Haley can actually act and show raw emotion.  I could buy that child actor as bitter, fearful and distraught much more than Loylds portrayal.  Although I still think having a teenage actor would have made a world of difference in the role.

2) The music

Moving on to the music Duel of the Fates was not a bad song but definitely did not have the flare or style of the earlier STAR WARS movies.  The music seems very bland throughout the whole film and has nothing memorable about it.  Lucas could have easily hired the best trained musicians in the world and come up with a much better score.

3) Anakin does not have a father!

The idea of the kid just being born from the mother without any sex?  I was thinking is this kid friends with Jesus?  The movie totally screwed up that explanation.  So the midichlorians just happen to get his mother pregnant for no reason?  Sounds like Village of the Damned to me.  The film could have really used a role of an absentee father, abusive father, or tragic death of a beloved father because of the sand people, or some criminal element to explain the aggression that Anakin would hold on to in the future that would trigger his anger and raw emotion.  I mean in the film we don't see Watto abusing them or treating them like sub human beings like true slavery.  I mean little Annie and Shmi didn't look beaten, starved, or humiliated enough to trigger the kind of hatred that Yoda later implies.

4) Jar Jar Binks

Jar Jar Binks character overall was played like Disneys goofy a doofus put in the movie just for the kids in the audience.  When the gungan leader made him a general in the movie I was thinking could it possibly get any worse.  Several of your race are going to possible die and you put an idiot in charge.

5) Darth Maul

Finally we come to Darth Maul a cool looking character.  But the movie only gives him 1 line of dialogue.  Maybe 10 words total thats it.  Did Lucas forget that it was Darth Vader that really made the first trilogy work.  Without that menacing bad guy figure the whole movie falls apart.  Darth Maul should have probably been killed off in the 2nd or 3rd film.

6) Everything taking place on Tattooine

Now the issue of Tattooine.  It seems like in every movie we are going back to the desert planet of little to no importance on the far rim of the universe, yet everything significant seems to take place on that sandy rock.  Instead of coming up with an different original new world, that would be refreshing for the audience, we are back on Tattooine for most of the movie.

7) Anakin building C-3PO

C-3PO being built by Anakin was a stupid idea and made no real sense to the story.  If Annie was such a genius he would have built a droid that would be more useful to Wattos shop not a protocol droid.  Utterly stupid nonsense and hurts the story.  It would have been better to leave R2D2 and C3PO out of the prequel trilogy altogether until the end of Revenge of the Sith and come up with new original droids for the new movies.

8) The evil droids

Now I am positive Lucas stole from the G.I.Joe cartoon show with all the bad guys being robots because our little audience could not handle seeing regular people die in battle.  Why would the machines have death cries, they don't feel any pain they are robots just ridiculous.

I could go on and on, the point is the movie is strictly made for young kids to sell toys and merchandise.  The older fans of the original trilogy will be very disappointed.  It took George Lucas 15 years to come up with this pile of crap he should not have even bothered.  I have to rate this movie 1 star giving it anymore than that would be dishonest to a buyer.",1450828800,6,6484,4.312344656172328
649993,3,6303454038,"As a part of the whole, The Phantom Menace accomplishes what it needs to, even if it isn't completely necessary.

The film demonstrates that even the iconic villain Darth Vader was once a mostly innocent (if slightly arrogant) child, introduces the prophecy of the chosen one, reveals previously unknown elements of the Force, and establishes the situation of the Jedi, the Sith, and the Old Republic.

These elements could have been introduced in the next two films alone. But the inclusion of The Phantom Menace allows for more slow development, as the other two films are packed with more crucial events. As aggravating as this must have been when it was first released, it is easy to appreciate the slow development of these movies now that all three of them are readily accessible.

For my part, I had seen only Episode IV when I first viewed The Phantom Menace, and without much to connect it with or compare it to, I enjoyed it very much, loved the characters, and was never bored. Almost completely ignorant of Star Wars, I was riveted and couldn't wait to continue with the next episodes. Although I gathered from his name that he was Luke Skywalkers father, I had no idea that Anakin would grow up to be Darth Vader. This movie was an unpredictable and interesting adventure on strange other worlds with likable characters to root for, including some very cool Jedi.

The score is versatile and interesting, foreshadowing some of the things to come, while the visual effects are mostly good, especially for the time. The movie still has that fun, adventurous feel before the trilogy begins to make way for the weightier story of Anakins destruction.

As someone who enjoys re-watching movies over and over again, I admit that re-watching this one is a little more tedious than it should be. Although it works as a good introductory episode, nothing very significant to the story as a whole actually happens, and some of the acting is very stilted. It is probably more appealing to children than adults, but thats not always a bad thing. Overall, The Phantom Menace serves its purpose as a fun prologue to the Star Wars saga, and I think it adds more than it takes away.",1450828800,2,2179,4.753968253968254

649997,5,6303454038,"With the new release - 'The Force Awakens' set to break box-office records...thought it about time i actually watched
the series in the order intended.
'Star-Wars' is almost certainly the most revered Sci-Fi Movie-Series of all time.
Though i've owned all the Blu-ray versions since there release i have not re-watched the original series in this format
despite owning it, though i have watched the three prequels in the HD format.
Always meant to watch the six in it's correct order guess i've been a little wary of doing so because the prequels having
been filmed somewhat later benefit from superior special-effects, however, the release of the Seventh has given me the
inspiration to take the journey in the correct order....so here we go -
MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU
Jedi Knight 'Qui-Gon Jinn' (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' (Ewan McGregor) save Senator 'Padme'
(Natalie Portman) from the advancing Federation forces stealing a ship to escape, after encountering hostile fire during
their escape from Naboo the ship has suffered damage and is in need of repair.
They stop off at Tatooine where they must negotiate with a trader to acquire the parts they need to continue however
they have no money and the credit offered by 'Qui-Gon Jinn' is of no value.
A young slave 'Anakin Skywalker' (Jake Lloyd) an extremely talented youngster who is not yet aware of his destiny offers
to exploit his masters greed and weakness for gambling by taking part in a race to help get the parts needed for 'Qui-Gon'
and his passengers to continue on their way.
The Jedi Knight see's great potential in the the young 'Anakin' and makes his freedom a part of the deal.....
Now with the youngster along they continue their journey to seek help for Naboo from the republic, 'Senator Padme's''
plea for help is rejected, in the face of this she determines that she must return to her people to face impossible odds,
with 'Qui-Gon' 'Obi-Wan' and 'Skywalker' by her side she will ave to form an unlikely alliance to fight the Federation and
their army of Droids.
With many great battle and fight sequences along the way coupled with many colourful and unusual characters many
of whom become an integral part of what is yet to come, this is an imaginative movie series that like myself many will
want to re-explore ahead of the Blu-ray / DVD release of the Seventh-Film hopefully not too deep into next year (2016)",1450569600,,2412,4.814457831325301

And judging from some of the negative reviews (posted years ago here), I think some people miss the more subtle character traits that give clues to the character's future, and how they identify with other characters.

Along time ago in a galaxy far far away a visionary director decided to tell the tale of the beginning of his original masterpiece. An origin story of an iconic villain turned hero. The prophecy was always right for Darth Vader brought balance to the force by killing the emperor & saving the last living jedi, his son Luke  Skywalker. People don't realize that. Vader was not a monster, just a misguided & hurt man seduced by the manipulative power hungry emperor. He was evil. And he fooled our hero into believing that he can save the one thing he loved most. Padame. The emperor lied to Vader and told him he killed Padame. Their child dieing with her. But I'm going to far. Back to the subject at hand. Everyone hates Menace because of jar jar  binks. Although he is terrible I have come to accept him. Besides without him there would be no empire. It was jar jar who gave emergency powers to chancellor palpatine and with that power he dissolved the Senate & created the first galactic empire. Getting ahead of myself again. I love Menace. The pod race was interesting going through the planet core underwater was a spectacle. The droids were humorous & darth maul was awesome. Not to mention the unbelievably fabulous light saber battle at the end. So please people, stop hating on this movie. It wasn't that bad. It's star wars!!!",1450396800,,1473,4.575757575757576

650325,4,6303454038,"Ok, so I have heard all the complaints about this film, and while some make valid points, there is alot that makes this a worthy addition to the saga.

In 1999, I took the liberty of reading the book before seeing the film, and I feel that the reason why the film is disappointing is because alot of the scenes in the book that helped developed Anakin's character were left out.  The first pod race that happened before the party from Naboo arrived was not there, and that was essential in setting up his character in the book.  Jake Lloyd was just given a bad hand to begin with because he had to work harder to develop the character since the story was not going to do it.

My one main complaint though was introducing Jar Jar.  I have always believed this was a useless character and should not have been there in the first place.  The group in the original trilogy did not have a token comic relief character (unless you want to give that to C-3PO), so having Jar Jar was not in the best interest of the story or the film.  Luckily, in the later films his appearance was cut down to a few scenes in Episode 2, but then we have him as the primary person to support the ascension of the Emperor.  I have always felt that to make the idiot your most important character was kind of a bad move, and I have never liked this guy.

However, on the plus side, the lightsaber duel in the end has always been my favorite of all the duels in the saga.  I have always been a fan of Ray Parks and he made Darth Maul into a total badass.  I heard someone describe Maul as ""the first sith ninja,"" and that was all due to Ray Parks.

I like this movie and will recommend it to anyone.",1446163200,,1672,4.158385093167702

This episode should have focused on Obi-wan, and set the stage for the tragedy of Anakin's fall to the Darkside in Episode 3, but Lucas and his team of screenwriters failed to apply any forethought to the overarching plot.

650734,5,6303454038,"One of my favorite Star Wars films, the Phantom Menace tells the origins of Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the start of the political downfall to erect the evil Galactic Empire. Filled with intense Pod Racing, Lightsaber swordplay, and one of the coolest villains in Star Wars since Vader. Phantom Menace is a different experience from the original trilogy because of it's heavy political atmosphere. Many will try to argue that it is a terrible film, mainly because of it's script, which is written to be corny since it is a ""Space Opera"". Another is an ""overuse of CGI"" which is also not true, since their are plenty of models, props, and practical explosions. Lastly there is the character of Jar-Jar Binks, the most hated character for some vague reason. He is the comical relief character, aimed mostly at children, but instead a bunch of 30 year olds think he's not funny and annoying, and find C3P-O in Empire Strikes Back to be absolutely hilarious because he was funny when they were children. This film is not for anybody who still watch the original trilogy on VHS, because they will hate you and start yelling about how their ""childhood was ruined"".",1440892800,,1168,4.8159203980099505

650944,4,6303454038,"This film gets way too much of a negative wrap. The delusional original trilogy social inept fanboys claim it was an utter failure. ""One of the worst films of all time"" they say....yet somehow this film has made over 1 BILLION dollars at the worldwide box office and is one of the most sucessful films of all time. How is this possible if people didn't....wait...wait...are you ready? How is this possible if...MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T ENJOY THE MOVIE? Seriously, There are far worst movies out there that aren't even as heavily criticized as this one and yet the original trilogy obsessed psychos claim this to be one of ""the worst of all time."" This is because expectations were so high when this film was released and Lucas was competing with the imaginations of millions of fans that had nearly 20 years to imagine what the beginning to their favorite saga was like. While Phantom Menace is definitely far from being a perfect film, it is definitely an entertaining and fun one, filled with mystery and a great sense of discovery. I will never forget how I felt when I first saw the film and how taken back I was when I first saw the underwater world of the Gungans, our first epic shot of Naboo, the Ben-Hur inspired pod race and the first time I saw Maul ignite his double bladed lightsaber ( I was literally blown away with amazement). Director George Lucas is definitely a visual director, as he has admitted it himself in J.W. Rinzler's ""The Making of Star Wars"" books, George has always found it difficult to write a story on paper. He is a great idea generator and when he is teamed up with a good writer, such as Lawrence Kasdan, he can know no limits. When it comes to Phantom Menace's story, this is where the problem lies, it has various plot holes, yet I admire Lucas' attempts because I can tell he was trying to tell an ambitious story not like the original trilogy. I see that Lucas really wanted to approach the history behind the original trilogy seriously and give it real merit, almost like a retelling of the events that led up to The War of Independence or World War 2. People complain that a story involving trade and taxation is boring but in Lucas' original notes he spoke about greedy ""trader barons"" and how the Republic became corrupt because of this, so don't get mad because they were always part of the story. Unfortunately in order to grasp what was really going on in terms of this film's Trade Blockade plot I had to read the books Cloak of Deception, Darth Plagueis, and the movie novel, which is not a good sign because you shouldn't need to seek out other media to understand a films plot line.

Initially, I always thought Naboo was being taxed by the Trade Federation and refused to pay the taxes imposed on by the Federation and as a result the Federation imposed a blockade, despite the fact that Naboo ""is a democracy and the people have decided."" Turns out, as revealed through the book based on the original screenplay (and the must read for all Star Wars fans masterpieces ""Darth Palgueis"" and ""Cloak of Deception"") that it is THE TRADE FEDERATION THAT IS BEING TAXED BY THE REPUBLIC AND IN RETALIATION ARE BLOCKADING THE PLANET OF NABOO. Why Naboo out of all the planets? Because this is where Senator Palpatine (Sideous) uses the opportunity to become Chancellor. That is why Naboo was specifically chosen. It was all decided in advance with the Federation thinking that Sideous was doing them a favor but Sideous was in it for himself. THIS IMPORTANT CONCEPT WAS COMPLETELY OVERLOOKED AND LOST IN THE FILM! Lucas really should have reiterated more on the fact that it was the Trade Federation who was trying to play the victim here, upset because THEY WERE THE ONES BEING TAXED and used this victimization as a guise to blockade Naboo in retaliation against the Republic's enforcement of taxes on all of their trade routes. We also needed a scene with the Trade Federation asking Sideous, ""Why Naboo, out of all the planets in the entire galaxy,"" then Sideous could give them an answer they want to hear, ""Because Naboo has plasma and other resources that will make you wealthy. Don't worry about the Republic, I will make the invasion legal."" This would have conveyed to the viewer the motivation for the villains, something that was sorely lacking in this film. Instead everything is super vague and the only thing that caries the film are the visuals and Liam Neeson's great portrayl of Qui Gong.

The sub-plot of discovering Anakin and freeing him from slavery had very little issues to me. However the depictions of slavery could have been a little crueler in order to be more believable but I think it was more of a life of forced servitude rather than slavery as you and I know it and you have to remember that Anakin is Watto's bread and butter, he's the only human that can pod race, remember? So beating him to the brink of death wouldn't make sense.

This film is also heavily criticized for it's acting, with critics claiming that the performances were wooden. It is here that I deeply disagree. I think people went into this film expecting performances akin to the original trilogy but they have to realize that these are completely different times and people we are dealing with in this film. I love the characters in this film because they are noble. This isn't a film about rebels and pirates, it's about Jedi and nobles. I think Liam Neeson, as Qui-Gong Jinn, is the heart of this film and if there is one central saving grace that carries this film out of its various plot holes it is his character. I think he is amazing. Liam Nessons presence is like Alec Guiness' in the original Star Wars. He literally carries the film on his shoulders and I can watch him being a wise Jedi all day because he does it flawlessly. He is literally the ideal Jedi that I always use to imagine about before the Prequel Trilogy came out. He is also perfect at being the ideaized father figure for Anakin and Obi Wan. I also like his individualistic nature in regards to the Jedi Council; he's not afraid to go against Yoda and the other's ideas/decisions. I think his performace was excellent and not wooden. I think too many people mistake playing a noble character for a wooden performance.

The same goes for Natalie Portman's performance as Queen Amidala. She performs well beyond her years and does an excellent job (her best performance out of the entire trilogy) of playing a conflicted and inexperienced young Queen. In addition Ewam McGregor is perfectly casted a Obi Won, despite playing more of a supportive role in this film and the actress that plays Anakin's mother does a fantastic job as well and is very believable.

It was also great to see Ian McDiarmid return as Sideous/Palpatine/Emperor, he's an awesome actor. It helped connect the film to the old trilogy. I love this film because ultimately the villain (Sideous) wins...all while the good guys think they won...hence the PHANTOM menace...the real bad guy's vistory is unseen.

I also want to mention that I really enjoyed Jake Lloyd as Anakin. I love his Gee Whiz attitude and I think the pod race sequence was an amazing way to convey Anakin's force powers without coming accross like Superboy and without being too far fetched. It's amazing to think it's a 9 year old boy flying that pod!

In regards to the controversial midichlorains plot device..I think people need to wake up when it comes to this. MIDICHLORIANS ARE NOT THE FORCE, SO STOP SAYING THAT'S WHAT THE FILM DEPICTS! Midichlorians are microscopic organisms that live within all living cells (like organelles) and if you listen, as a Jedi or Sith does, you can hear them communicating THE WILL OF THE FORCE. The force is still mystical, so stop complaining! I like this concept because it's a reality: not everyone is born equally, some are born with talent some are not. Some things I can do better than you, some things you can do better than me. If anything this makes the concept of people with super powers like the Jedi seem more real. If any fat couch potato could simply call upon the will of the force than the whole concept loses credence (and it's exactly these type of people who hate this concept: Fat couch potato fan boys who wish they could be Jedi, wishing they could telekinetically bring the next slice of pizza to them from the pizza box from across the room).

In regards to Jar Jar, I think he gets way too much scrutiny and hate and I think he interjects a sense of personality other than noble into this film. Despite what critics say his character was important because without him, the Queen would never have had the aid of the Gungan army. People need to learn to lighten up too when it comes to his comedy and learn how to tap into that inner child (if they still have one). I feel that the people who hate Jar Jar and the Gungans are the same that hated the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi. Those people probably shouldn't be liking Star Wars to begin with in my opinion. For some odd reason there is this belief out there that after Empire Strikes Back that Lucas sold out and created the Ewoks to appeal to kids and make toys but if you read J.W. Rinzler's ""The Making of Star Wars"" books and see some of the first story treatments for the original film, you'd see that there was always supposed to be a battle on a forest planet that involved furry indigenous creatures, so essentially you haven't liked Star Wars since the beginning! So get off this boat and stop complaining about things that are geared towards children.

And in regards to the dubious allegations that his character is racist, people need to stop being ignorant. First of all he played by a black actor Ahmed Best. Second of all. people claiming this is racist towards Jamaicans in fact display their idiotic ignorance because those making this claim clearly have never met a Jamaican in their entire lives! News to you politically correct Stalinist: Jamaicans don't even remotely act like this! Moreover, George Lucas is married to and has a child with an African-American woman and has lobbied against racism in the film industry against black film makers and how the industry overlooks films made by African-Americans.

Then there are more racist accusations with the character Watto, with critics claiming that he is a racist cartoon against Jews. Again people are so ignorant it is sad. First of all, Lucas is Jewish (Lucas is a Jewish name). Second of all, the character of Watto is a tribute to the film Ben-Hur (just like the pod race was a tribute to the chariot race). Watto's character is based on Hugh Griffith's performance as Sheik IIderim, who too was a slave owner. Watto's face was even molded after that character, which is the reason for the big nose. People really need to stop trying to claim this film is racist because in the end they are the ones that look like fools.

One thing I love about this film is the whole Ben-Hur tribute because that is one of my favorite movies ever. I love that this film pays tribute to older films and aside from the Ben-Hur references I feel that Qui Gong's character is a tribute to a samurai character out of an Akira Kurasawa movie. In fact, I feel like this movie is like a mash up of an Akira Kurawsawa and Flash Gordon, more so than the original Star Wars. Darth Maul reminds me of the bad guy samurai/cowboy hunting the good guys who says very little from the old samurai/western films and is a total badass.

I also love how this film introduces us to the mysterious Sith but leaves us guessing and drooling for more. Darth Maul was a great character (glad he's back in the TV show) and the fight choreography he performed was amazing.

It's attributes such as this that make this film worth viewing and where Lucas' strengths shine through. The Pod Race is easily one of the greatest chases in the history of film and always leaves me at the edge of my seat every time I watch it. And the sound is amazing! I also love the fact that Anakin is only 9 years old but races like a god! This was an excellent way to show how much of a prodigy and special kid he was, while at the same time paying tribute to Lucas' old days of racing hot rods in Modesto.

I also love the fact that out of the entire prequel trilogy, this was the only one shot on film and as a result, looks more photo realistic. I think this is the best looking of the prequel films and that the CGI blends in perfectly with the real locations (Episode 2 and 3 was blue screen composited with miniature sets). The cinematography is great and sets are beautiful.

I also love the numerous hidden themes that lay beneath the service in this film which aren't present in any ither Star Wars film; the theme of duality: there are two Padme's, the queen and the handmaiden...there are also two Palpatine's; Darth Sideous and the Senator

there is also the theme of symbiosis with the midichlorians and all living beings, and with the Naboo and Gungans.

Despite these positives there are several more plot holes that were overlooked in this film and hurt it from reaching its full potential.

In the film there was no reason for Anakin to go with the Queen and Qui Gong to Naboo. In the novel, which is based of the original screenpley, this was explained: since the council rejected Qui Gong's plea to train Anakin he essentially was responsible for him and was his guardian. We needed to see this. It should have been in the movie, not cut.

Also having Anakin built C3P0 felt very lame, especially to ""help mom around the house."" In the novel this was better explained: it was more than to just help mom around the house, it was so he could use him to interpret languages from aliens during trading so Watto wouldn't get swindled in a deal. This explanation gives much more credence to Anakin being the builder of C3PO. We needed to see this. It should have been in the movie, not cut.

The novel also explains the removal of the explosive device that all slaves have, this was a huge plot hole in the film. We needed to see this. It should have been in the movie, not cut.

And my final critique is against the improbability of Anakin finding child-sized helmet and goggles in the Star Fighter. To me this was the most unforgivable and stupidest mistake in the entire film. This was not needed at all.

In the end, I have to honestly admit that I really like this film despite all it's flaws. For me, it is redeemed mostly by Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman's performances as true nobles and the breathtaking action pieces and alluring sets. I get what Lucas was trying to do by approaching this film with more of a political mindset. I appreciate that he took that back story very seriously, it's just that his direction and editing decisions could have been better. Despite this the undeniable sense of discovery and mystery I feel when I watch this make me feel like it is a great introduction to the Star Wars back story and Expanded Universe. I wouldn't recommend watching this before the original trilogy however. Watch those first and if you crave to learn about the back story to Star Wars then watch this. I definitely recommend picking up the book ""Darth Plagueis"" or ""Cloak of Deception"" by James Luceno after. To me, that is the real Episode 1 that has all the main back story to everything, Phantom Menace was just a preface...a real fun one.",1438992000,34,15367,4.572258533042847

This is not a joke, you will be disappointed, even if you think it can't be that bad. Well it is, that bad. In fact this is Apple Maps bad.

Imagine someone making a movie out of all the homevideos of their children which they happened to find somewhere in the trash in the garage. It is like this, but more annoying. Well, and it is boring as well. Whenever it is not annoying it is boring.

And the computer graphics. CGI. While in the old films, they used real physical models of everything to make a very nice scene. Here they shot everything in front of a green screen and then added some clip-art in the background, in microsoft paint. Remember, this is 1999. This is when Quake III Arena came out.

2. Two Jedi, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, are sent to negotiate with the Federation to end the blockade. Instead, the TF tries to murder them. These 2 Jedi, while on board the TF's ship, witness them assemble their droid army, and hide in the ships for the droid armies. This is the ONLY way that they are able to get themselves into Naboo, due to the blockade (remember this, I'll come back it later in a sec).

3. Qui-Gon & Obi-Wan rescue Jar Jar, Queen Amidala, and much of her guard & council & handmaidens, ALL of whom PERSONALLY WITNESS the Trade Federation's invasion and destruction. During the rescue and their exit of Naboo, the Trade Federation literally tries to KILL THEM all! There is a recording of the repair droids on Amadala's ship being destroyed by the Federation.

4. They have a recording from someone in the Federation's prison camps saying ""The death toll is catastrophic!""

So, they have a recording of a TF prisoner, a Gungan, 2 Jedi (whose credibility should be good enough), and a minimum of a dozen + witnesses to the Federation's illegal actions.

Now of course, the Trade Federation, being the meanies that they are, will of course claim during the Galactic Senate hearing that ""There is no proof."" But does she attempt to bring in any of these witnesses? Show any of these recordings? Nope!

Perhaps if Amidala spent more time focusing on making her case to the Senate instead of changing in & out of elaborate outfits and makeup, maybe she could have saved the entire Republic from Palpatine, and prevented Anakin's turn to the dark side, and she and Anakin could have spawned several powerful Jedi children and started a whole new generation of powerful Jedi who serve the Republic.

651428,1,6303454038,"Let me preface this review by saying I am a huge fan of the original three movies, particularly the first two. If George Lucas' name and the title ""Star Wars"" were absent from the poster and ads during the pre-release hype of this film, this overlong wasted 2-hours-of-your-life masquerading as a movie would have miserably bombed at the box office. The best way to sum it up is this: it is as if the filmmaker didn't know anything about Star Wars, except the filmmaker was the writer and director of the original Star Wars films. The result is what you might expect if the Star Wars franchise was turned over to a different production company, as was done in Superman III. However, Lucas did not trade his gold mine for a billion dollars, but instead he may have killed the golden goose. This is probably one of a half-dozen of the biggest disappointments in film history, given the hype, the expectations, and the name surrounding this movie. Sure, it would probably not live up to the originals, even if it was good, but it doesn't work even modestly well as a story. The script needed only about 14 rewrites.

The story is supposed to chronicle the early life of Anakin Skywalker who eventually becomes Darth Vader, the baddie from the original movies. A potentially noble endeavor, I guess, in that it would tell in more detail the story of the Clone Wars before the rise of the Empire. The Empire is chronicled in the original 1977 movie beginning with the renamed fourth episode, ""A New Hope"". Even aside from the story of this prequel, of which about 98% makes no sense, there are serious continuity problems in how this film fits in with the original three films, aka episodes IV-VI.

Several aspects of the ""story"" are a jumbled mess. When we first meet young Anakin Skywalker, he is supposedly a slave. And yet he gets tons of free time to work on, guess what?-- a droid called C3PO. First continuity problem: in a ""A New Hope"" C3PO is programmed as a ""protocol droid, versed in all the customs of different races of aliens. When he meets Luke Skywalker (son of Anakin) in Star Wars IV, C3PO knows nothing about Luke and vice-versa. He doesn't even know about R2D2's mission. Further, what would a slave be doing making a Protocol Droid, versed in all the customs? Not to mention that slaves normally have NO free-time, the whole thing makes little sense. It seemed Lucas wanted an excuse to bring C3PO back. I love C3PO, but this was not the way to bring him into the story.

Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor play Jedi Knights, and they are wearing beige-colored robes similar to those worn by Obi-Wan Kenobi on the desert planet. Well, that makes sense, doesn't it? Obi-Wan aka Ben Kenobi was a Jedi, right? Well, if you remember, Luke's uncle also wore the same type of robe: they were robes for the desert! I never once thought in the original movie that the beige sand robes were Jedi uniforms! Qui-Gon Jinn was sort of an interesting Jedi who was at odds with the order, and I would have liked to understand better why he was in conflict with the other Jedis. And Samuel Jackson as another Jedi was a terrible casting choice. I admire the work of Jackson about as much as any actor, but he seemed like his character had been spawned from Planet East Los Angeles.

Then there is the race competition that might liberate young Anakin from his bondage as a slave. At the time, I thought, OK, he'll lose the race, and then we'll really have a story. Nope. He wins the race. Of course, the race only lasts about four hours, showing off all the neat CGI affects. This is no story. There's no obstacle for Anakin. His slavery really didn't seem that bad, and now he is liberated easily. I also missed what the Phantom or the Menace was, except for a red-clad dark Jedi called Darth Maul who seemed, for reasons not entirely explained, to like to beat up on Jedis. It seemed the movie needed a baddie called ""Darth"" somewhere, and he was it.

Ultimately, a wasted opportunity, as Lucas probably got 200 million to make this thing. What the film really needed was a script editor. Or maybe a better storyteller. Lucas really made five and a half good films (maybe six and a half at most if you liked THX 1138), American Graffiti, Star Wars IV: A New Hope, Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi (really about half a good film, all the Ewok adventures seemed completely at odds with the rest of the film), The Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Maybe this Star Wars movie wouldn't have been so bad if it had been written by someone who was truly dedicated to Star Wars. Lucas didn't seem up to the task.",1431734400,3,4669,4.5076741440377806

651522,3,6303454038,"When Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace hit theaters, my roommate was a giant Star Wars fan.  Naturally, I saw it in the theaters a couple of times and again on VHS when it hit home theater (those were the days before DVD really started to take off).  It's been years since I'd seen any of the films, so when some friends decided to watch them all again, I was gamed.  I think it will be an interesting journey.

This is the beginning of the story that took place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.  We begin with two Jedi knights.  Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) have traveled to a distant planet to help end a trade embargo.  Unfortunately, their meeting is really a trap, and they have to escape.  That leads them across the path of Jar Jar Binks (voiced by Ahmed Best) and eventually Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman).  The queen requests that the Jedi take her to the Republic counsel to plead the case for her planet.

But the journey doesn't go quite as planned, and the ship makes a landing on the planet of Tatooine to make repairs.  It's there they meet a young child named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd).  Qui-Gon immediately recognizes that The Force is strong in this child.  Will they be able to take him with them?  Will Queen Amidala find help for her planet?

Now, when this movie first came out, I remember being impressed by it.  I thought the story moved along well and the special effects were amazing.  Yes, I found a few slower parts with the plot, but overall, it was good.

Time has not been kind to this film.

Almost as soon as it had started, my friends and I commented on how the effects have not aged well.  What was cutting edge in 1999 looks painfully dated today.  Oh, they are still watchable.  But you can tell what is real and what is an effect.

Unfortunately, one of the big calling cards for the movie was the special effects.  The story leaves a lot to be desired.  I often complain about a book that does a background dump to tell us how the characters came to be where they are.  Essentially, that's what this movie does.  True, it's not as bad as the later prequels, but much of the suspense has been taken out of the film since we know what happens.  There are some cool moments when we first meet characters or see certain things fall into place, but they are few and far between.  And the politics of the piece doesn't completely help since that is part of what slows things down.  Honestly, I bet half an hour could be cut and it would help the movie.

Now there are some cool sequences in the film.  I love the pod race, for example.  And the light saber fight at the end is very well done.  Although here again we run into poor story telling since there is a plot complication that makes no logical sense at all.

The acting is mostly okay.  There's nothing here that is going to win awards, but there is very little here that will take you out of the film.  The exception to that is Jake Lloyd.  He's a cute boy, but he really can't act.  Plus there's the fact that he looks way too young to be developing a romantic relationship with Natalie Portman's Amidala.  That relationship just has the ick factor to me.

And I haven't even commented on Jar Jar Binks.  He seems to have pretty much universal hatred coming his way.  This alien creature was supposed to provide the comic relief, but his awkward dialect and clumsiness can get annoying.  I seem to be one of the few who can tolerate him, but I know many who find him annoying.

Unfortunately, Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace is the best of the prequels, and it's only average.  I'm looking forward to getting to the original trilogy where George Lucas actually had a compelling story to tell.",1430697600,,3749,4.360347322720695

The final battle sequence between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan is arguably the best lightsaber battle of the first six films.  But yes the acting and story a lot of the time is not there, which I won't really go into detail because a lot of other reviewers have already summed a lot of those things up.  I would say that this movie is worth a watch just for the sake of putting it into context with the other films but really you couldn't watch sections of the films like meeting Anakin and the jedi temple related stuff and you would still understand the rest of the movies fairly well...Honestly I don't really think this should have been in the saga, there are just so many plot points and things that happen that have very little use for the saga as a whole.

The original three movies (Episodes 4-6) were truly well-written, imaginative, and ground-breaking with emotion and excitement. The prequels were George Lucas needing money to generate the poor out-of-context CG for Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull. I am glad Lucas sold Star Wars to Disney out of shame that his fat, pudgy fingers were squeezing what was originally a beautiful franchise with unknown (at the time) actors with potential theatrical talent into a mass-produced, cheap CG fest (despite large budgets) with actors who are qualified for dinner theater and high school drama clubs.

I wish Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor had declined their roles, but at least reduced the poor quality of the movie overall. Unfortunately, the movie was still a waste of time, because Lucas only created the prequels for money, and not for actual plot.",1428710400,4,1094,5.354651162790698

651943,1,6303454038,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I wouldn't sit though this horrible nightmare again for anything.,1426550400,2,105,4.888888888888889
651944,2,6303454038,"Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace is the first film that George Lucas has directed and solely written since Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope in 1977. Let me phrase that differently; the last time George Lucas directed and solely wrote a film, that film was nominated for Oscars for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, not to mention Best Picture. So with that in mind, the fact that The Phantom Menace was such a disastrous mess is truly baffling! With a prequel to Star Wars that is written, executive produced and directed by the man who wrote, executive produced and directed this whole critically acclaimed series in the first place, there is ABSOLUTELY no reason why anything should have gone wrong!
The film has many problems, but I think the biggest problem is the characters. In 1977, George Lucas brought us one of the most unforgettable cast of characters in the history of cinema. Luke, Leia, Han, Chewy, R2, C-3PO and Darth Vader. In Episode 1 there is not a single character you care for. Again, what happened?! We know that Lucas is capable of creating compelling characters. What happened here?! From Qui-Gon to Padme, every character in this movie is shallow and passionless.
Plot is a close second for biggest problems in this movie. The amount of plot holes and times Lucas's script contradicts itself is baffling.
This has been said by many people before, but I'm going to say it again here; when watching this film, you honestly feel like Lucas wrote a first draft of the screenplay and just stopped there. That goes for the PLOT and the CHARACTERS. The script if full of plot holes and self-contradictions. If Lucas took more time to work on the story, he would have been able to find much better ways to connect the dots/plot points. Same goes for the characters. If Lucas spent more time on the script, he would have been able to find a way to present the characters in a way that is more compelling.
(the fallowing paragraph does contain SPOILERS.)
A better way to develop these characters would have been for Obi-Wan to develop a bond with Anakin, not Qui-Gon. Seriously, Obi-Wan is irritated by Anakin before they even meet.(""Why do I get the feeling that we just picked up another pathetic life form?"") In his defense, we as the audience are pretty annoyed by Anakin too, but that's besides the point. Obi-Wan continues to complain about Anakin throughout the film and only takes him in as an apprentice because his mentor asked him too in his dying breath. Obi-Wan should have been the one to find Anakin. Obi-Wan could have been like the father that Anakin never had. Developing a closeness between Anakin and Obi-Wan from the beginning would have made their relationship in the future films a lot better. It would have made their fight in Episode III all the more compelling.
Also, wouldn't it have been better if Anakin was suffering from some sort of abuse or neglect during his slavery on Tatooine? In the film, Anakin is just a normal boy. He has a house, a mother, friends and parts so he can build a pod racer and C-3PO, implying not only free time, but a steady source of income, despite the fact that neither he or his mother have a paying job. The story would have been more compelling if Watto was abusing Anakin or not feeding him or something like that. That would have given the Jedi a more compelling reason to rescue him. In the film he's just a normal kid who just happens to be a slave.
Jake Lloyd's acting is bad, even for child actor standards, but honestly I can't complain after the horrific monstrosity that was Hayden Christensens acting in the same role in the next two prequels. Ill take Jake Lloyd's acting any day of the week.
Also needless to say that Jar Jar is irritating and got way too much screen time.
The lightsaber fight at the end, while outstanding for the most part, does bring up another problem I have with the entire prequel trilogy, which is Lucas as a director. This mostly apples to lightsaber fights. When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are fighting Darth Maul in the energy chamber room, a lot more cool stuff could have been done with them fighting along side those energy columns. An awesome shot of the three of them silhouetted by the energy beam is shown, but that only lasts for like 1 or 2 seconds. If your going to make them fight in a very stylish place, at least TRY to make the most of it. Scenes like that were a missed opportunity and could have been done a lot better in the hands of another director.
The film isn't all bad. This is the film that brought us ""Duel of the Fates"", my all time favorite Star Wars song! There are other aspects of the film that I enjoyed and many other aspects that I disliked. But to sum it all up; George Lucas, we all know you are better than this. This film, coming from you, is unacceptable!",1426377600,3,4818,4.5518433179723505

While Anakin Skywalker is just a nine-year-old boy and who obviously we will know as the father of Luke Skywalker and very well know as Darth Vader.

Despite a shaky start and the presence of questionable elements throughout, by the time it arrives at its finale it  definitely has won its place alongside the original Star Wars trilogy. The special effects are some of the most dazzling and amazing ever seen on the big screen.

I grew up watching the original trilogy and even at the age of 5 I remember The Empire Strikes Back being my favorite movie. Why? Because it was that good. It didn't matter if I was 5 or 25 that movie could appeal to all ages as did the whole original trilogy. That alone there is a sign of a great movie. This on the other hand is simply a movie for kids and not to be taken seriously as a Star Wars film. Bad dialogue, poor script, outrageous CGI, and Jar Jar Binks.

I looked the disc over and there wasn't a scratch on it, but I cleaned it anyway. Well then it stopped working altogether, and it was already June, so I wasn't expecting for this to work.

652888,5,6303454038,"The Phantom Menace, while having an entirely different cast, is a pretty fun movie.  In fact, I think it's not just a fun one, but one of the better ones.

Our bud, Obi-Wan Kanobi, is back in a much younger form from the likes of Ewan McGregor.  McGregor trades in his sporran and kilt for a light saber and robe.  All in all, he's not bad in the role.

The star of the show, little Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker, is a gas.  Give that kid a jet car and watch him go.  That was probably one of the best segments of the movie.

As with all Star Wars, the photography and special effects are state of the art.  George Lucas, writer and director and his crew at ILM, must have been at wits end trying to pull off what they managed to do.  Looking at the Sfx and Vfx ""cast"" you'll discover a list of names greater than some cities in the United States.  I might add that Hutchinson seems to crop up quite a bit in the Sfx crew.",1401840000,2,923,4.044198895027624

Sure the special effects were poor and overabundant - poorer in fact than the original trilogy, and yes ""Ani"" was annoying, not to mention that CGI horror....Jar Jar Binks! I can go on, and on, and on about what went wrong with Phantom Menace (an endless task). But really, why not focus on the positive?

Let's not forget the awesome Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, one of the greatest and most compelling characters in the prequel trilogy. And let's not forget that most badass of Sith fighters, Darth Maul. Let's not forget that battle in the arena. And the greatest lightsaber battle since a certain Darth Vader battled it out with Luke in Empire.

What makes The Phantom Menace shine, however, is its straightforward, simple plot, and it's jubilant childish sense of fun. And the fact that it doesn't star Hayden Christensen. The Phantom Menace is more light-hearted and fun than either Attack of the Clones or Revenge of the Sith, and it's also more enjoyable to watch.

653511,4,6303454038,"Very confusing for one who managed to miss all but one of this mega-successful series when they first came out. Looking to catch up with what had caused all the fuss, one naturally buys Star Wars: Episode I, so as to start at the beginning. Of course, it turns out that it is not actually the beginning of Star Wars as filmed and distributed, it is produced later but is meant to be an earlier book in the series. Imagine a series on the life of George Washington which begins with volume 9,  his last years. So newcomers beware.
For most viewers,  I would advise my own policy with regard to reviewers of such series as this.  Ignore them  save with regard to statements as to suitability of content for family viewing, excessive gore, foul language and other elements which turn off some viewers to any film regardless of its merits. In this case, that is no concern, I should think, for it is good 'clean"" family viewing, violence, but against robots and other machine-like characters (mostly), and an artificiality which removes most action from the realm of the 'real'. There is a plot intended as no more than a framework for the dazzling action scenes, there are clearly delineated Good and Evil characters, there is rich color, beautiful young woman, and handsome young men. There is even a little boy who is central to the plot. Get in on the fun and I doubt that you will care much about the deficiencies as measured by standards for ""Good and Bad"" movies.",1377648000,,1466,4.583969465648855

653517,3,6303454038,"I watched this again after not having seen it for several years.  The one thing that immediately popped out at me more than anything else: that kid can't act!  Most writers have trouble writing convincing dialogue for kids (I know this from personal experience), and Lucas is no exception.  Kids just don't say things like ""Yippee!"" and ""Woohoo!"" and when you try to make them say that stuff, it comes off as ridiculous.  But bad writing aside, this kid should never have been cast in this part.  I don't think he says one truly believable line in the whole film.  They also made a mistake in terms of his age; they should've made this character a few years older.  That would have also made more sense regarding the future romance with Amidala.
The second major problem for me is that Lucas tries way too hard to be cute.  It's nauseating.  Did he really think most adults or sci-fi fans would find this kid intriguing or be tickled by Jar Jar's escapades?  You think he would've learned from Return of the Jedi.  Ewoks might sell toys, but you lose a big chunk of your fan base in the process.  Star Wars wasn't a phenomenon because little kids liked it.  It was a movie for grownups...that kids also enjoyed.  He took everything that was wrong with Return of the Jedi and increased it a hundredfold for Phantom Menace.
All the way back in the '80s Lucas talked about his long-term plans for the franchise, and for decades we looked forward to its fruition.  What a disappointment.  But taken on its own, what I find sad is that I really do think this COULD have been a good film.  A little better directing, a little better writing, take out all the cuteness and get an older kid who can act...and this might've been something memorable (for good reasons).  The elements are there: the Jedi, the Sith, the Republic, the origins of Darth Vader, and I even like Queen Amidala.  I wonder if Lucas had such a mystique at that point that no one had the guts to tell him what he was doing wrong.  It seems so obvious in hindsight; it's hard to imagine that everyone involved thought, ""Hey, this is really fantastic!""",1374710400,,2113,4.510526315789473

The Phantom Menace begins with two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi on a mission to settle a conflict with the Trade Federation. The Federation has blockaded Naboo because their Trade Routes have been taxed and they are trying to get the Queen, Amidala, to sign a treaty that will stop the taxing. The Jedi are attempting to negotiate with the Federation and stop the situation that has gotten far out of hand. When the negotiations go wrong the Jedi find themselves in the midst of an invasion that the Trade Federation is planning on the peaceful planet of Naboo. The Jedi are intent to warn the Naboo but are a moment to late. The invasion begins. The Jedi attempt to flee the planet with the Queen for they fear she will be killed. Amidst their flee the ship they are in is damaged and they are forced to land on the desert planet of Tatooine where the fate of the galaxy will be changed forever. On the planet Tatooine they find a boy (who's name we all know) Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon believes this boy to be the chosen one who will bring balance to the force and is intent to bring him to the Jedi Council on Coruscant and have him tested to become a Jedi. To get the parts they need Anakin will have to race in a podrace and if he wins they will obtain the money for the parts they need. Meanwhile, a Sith spy, named Darth Maul, has been sent out to find the Queen that has escaped Naboo with the Jedi. Maul's hunt for the Queen and the finding of Anakin Skywalker will begin a battle that will be the first steps toward the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire and the Rebellion and ultimately begin the stride toward the original Star Wars film that we all know.

****PLOT SPOILERS:****

Episode I has one of the best plots of any of the Star Wars saga. There are two Jedi, a much younger Obi-wan and his master Qui-Gon, who are sent out to settle what they think is only a trade dispute with the Trade Federation (who are being controlled by a Sith Lord Darth Sidious) who set up a trade blockade and an invasion of the planet Naboo. The Jedi make their way to Naboo to help the planet's Queen escape and head to Coruscant which is the planet which the Senate occupies so she can get the Senate to help her with the trade blockade. On the way to get the Queen the Jedi meat a Gungan called Jar Jar Binks who is an outcast of his society, but helps them reach the city of Theed where the Queen is. When they reach the Queen they all try to escape her planet of Naboo but her space ship gets damaged and they have to stop on the planet of Tatooine to repair the ship. Qui-Gon makes a bet on a podrace with a local junk dealer to get him the parts he needs to repair the ship. The bet is placed on a slave boy who they recently met on Tatooine (a young Anakin Skywalker a.k.a. Darth Vader to all the Star Wars fans) who races pods and is strong with the force. The boy wins the race and is also granted his freedom as a stipulation as part of the bet. The ship is repaired but before they can leave Qui-Gon is attacked by a Sith Lord Darth Maul who was sent by his Sith Master Darth Sidious to capture the Queen. Qui-Gon narrowly escapes the battle and reunites with everyone on the Queen's ship as they head to Coruscant. Once they get to Coruscant the Queen tries to get the Supreme Chancellor to resolve her problem with the Trade Federation on Naboo right now. The Chancellor only offers to send a crew to investigate what is happening on Naboo. Since the Queen needs the problem solved now she moves for a vote of no confidence in the Chancellor and the Senate begins to elect a new Chancellor and one of the nominees is the Senator of Naboo Senator Palpatine, who is also the Sith Lord who setup the blockade in the first place. While this is happening the Jedi return to the Jedi council which is also on the planet Coruscant and Qui-Gon tries to get Yoda, Mace Windu and the rest of the Jedi Council to let young Anakin be trained as a Jedi. Mace Windu tells Qui-Gon that he will not be trained as he is too old and Yoda senses there is much fear in Anakin. The Queen and the Jedi then return to planet Naboo and form a plan to capture the Trade Federation Viceroy who is in charge of the Trade Federation. The Jedi and the Queen plan to storm the Palace of Theed through a secret passage while getting Jar Jar Binks to create a diversion with the help of his fellow Gungans who have banished him. The Gungans agree to help out to take the planet back from the Trade Federation and create a very large battle away from the city of Theed against the Trade Federation's battle droids. The Queen and Jedi storm the Palace and free some of the Queen's captured pilots and guards who set out on starfighters to take out the Trade Federations blockade ship that is blocking the planet. Anakin Skywalker is still with them but goes to hide in one of the starfighter's cockpits. While Anakin is hiding the group is ambushed by the Sith Lord Darth Maul who the Jedi then engage in one of the best lightsaber duels in all of the Star Wars films. The Queen in the meantime is attacked by some battle droids and Anakin who is sitting in the cockpit fires and takes out the battle droids but his ship begins to take off by itself because its on automatic pilot and it heads out to join the rest of the starfighters who are in a battle against the Trade Federation's ship. The Queen and her guards continue fighting more battle droids until they are able to reach the thrown room and capture the Viceroy. While this is happening Anakin is able to destroy the Trade Federation's ship by attacking it from the inside, once the ship has been destroyed all of the battle droids become deactivated. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan continue to fight Darth Maul but Darth Maul is able to deliver a fatal blow to Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan is albe to kill Darth Maul. Obi-wan rushes to his dyeing master's side and promises his dyeing master that he will train young Anakin to be a Jedi Knight.

****END OF PLOT SPOILERS.****

The main purpose of my review though is to defend Episode I which is one of my favorite Star Wars movies. Episode I has been bashed by more fanboys than any other movie on the planet and it really isn't fair because the Phantom Menace really is a great movie. The main problem I think people have is that they are TOO CLOSE to the original trilogy. They had their minds set before even seeing The Phantom Menace that it couldn't be as great as the original trilogy, and they cannot find a way to step back and truly see the many similarities between characters of Episode I and the original trilogy.

The number one complaint seems to be of Jar Jar Binks. Many fans think he is too silly and annoying. He was created as a comic-relief character who is supposed to be a silly character. He was also created with kids in mind. A lot of people who saw the Original Trilogy for the first time were kids when they saw it and have forgotten how amazing this movie is for kids because they have been watching it for 30 years and have gotten way too close to Star Wars to step back and look at it from another perspective. There are plenty of characters from the original trilogy who are just as silly as Jar Jar:
- C-3PO and R2-D2 are just as silly, if not even more silly because they are droids who argue and one of them can't even speak, he argues with beeping.
- You have the one of the main supporting cast Chewbacca (one of my all-time favorite characters) who looks like bigfoot who howls and roars every time he speaks, clearly thats pretty silly.
- The first time Yoda is introduced in the Empire Strikes back he is very silly as he hits R2 with his cane and yells Mine! Mine! Mine! as R2 tries to take back the lamp Yoda took from Luke.
- The entire group of Ewoks are silly for crying out loud.
The point I'm making is that there are plenty of characters from the original trilogy just like Jar Jar and people really just need to get over themselves and let themselves have some fun. Geez.

Another problem people seem to have is the plot. I have no idea how they really could. Yes, there is an awful lot going on in this movie but George does an excellent job at conveying what is going on always. I really think people are just trying to nitpick because they are looking for a problem because this isn't the same Star Wars movie they have grown up with.

I will say this about the rest of the prequels though; they rely too much on CGI. Episode I to me really feels like the Original Trilogy especially in a visual sense. I think if Eps II and III would have used more set pieces like Episode I did, those movies would have had much more of a Star Wars look and feel to them.

The only negative that I have about Episode I is I wish it would have had more Darth Maul. This seems to be a common complaint that I actually agree with. He is by far one of the coolest characters, and he is right up there as my favorite Star Wars character Darth Vader. Sometimes I think Darth Maul might actually be my favorite.

The bottom line is, if you don't watch Episode I uptightly you will have a great time with this movie. The Pod Race scene is so much fun and so is the final lightsaber duel. Also the movie has the iconic John Willaims score with it and that in itself is enough of a reason to enjoy this movie.",1370304000,2,7697,4.248464163822526

653703,4,6303454038,"Back in 1998/1999, I remember the excitement and the hype.  George Lucas was finally
going to do or had started to film the first of the prequels to his original trilogy.

Now for the good points - the costumes were excellent and the advancements in CGI
made the sets look more futuristic.  I loved Qui-Gon Jinn, the Jedi that didn't exactly
follow the rules, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the Jedi Council.  I loved Watto, Shmi and Anakin
Skywalker, Queen Amidala, and even annoying Jar Jar.

Then the not so good points - Anakin's lack of a father, midi-chorians, and also I felt
after seeing this, that it followed the formula of the fourth movie - Star Wars IV: A New

653817,4,6303454038,"I think that scenically this movie is VERY Wondrous and Fantastic.  The many and various space cities and the space vehicles and the Space itself are just fabulous.  (The vroom-vroom music and sound effects are not, though.  I had to keep turning down the loud Speeding-and-Warring noisy-type music, and then I would miss what the characters said when they began to speak again.)

(And the races and battle scenes seemed too long and drawn out.)

I wasn't very fond of the great multitude of peculiar fantasy creatures.  I grew weary with the weird and comic quality of so many peculiar creatures as denizens of outer space.  Became surfeited with them and the fascinating other worlds after awhile.  The movie might have benefited from being just a bit shorter.

On the other hand, I did enjoy all the robots very much--the way they were so much like real people.  Who cannot love R2D2, and the English-speaking, polite, butler-like robots like C3P02?  Even the evil robot warriers and the very tiny, evil, servant robots were very intriguing in their lifelikeness.  A lot of these fascinating robot characters, you have to look quick to catch a glimpse of them.  So much is going on in some of these scenes.

Overall, creatively, this is a fabulous, sensational production.  All the scenes have an awesome vastness and are beautiful compositions.  Some of the costumes are interesting artistically.

There are shades of ""Lord of the Rings"" in this movie.  Going into the big battle scene seemed copied right from it.  If you like the fantasy in LOTR, you can probably like it here (only there is a LOT more of it here).  And comparable to the DIGNITY of Aragorn/Stryder in LOTR, is the Jedi warrior played by Liam Neeson here.  I really LIKE him!  I think the character played by Neeson is fine and very sympathetic.  I couldn't believe that he died in the story!  No, no, to that; I wanted to see more of such an excellent character, good father-figure to young Anakin (who turns out unexpectedly to be a Christ-figure, for Heaven's sake!!)

The Jedi reminded me of an order of priests with their great tradition and dignity.  In this story, there is a prophecy that the son of a virgin will restore balance to the ? society, or something like that.  I missed so much of the dialogue, I hardly know any details of the story.  Anyway, I really, really liked Anakin, too, the little boy who is the young Christ figure.  He will become Luke Skywalker in later episodes.

This is a movie that will appeal to young kids and adults too.  (I mean it appealed to me, and I am an adult who is kidlike.)  And just looking at it without understanding the words that occur in the plot, a young person will understand which characters are clearly Good and which characters are clearly Evil--and they will wonder about the ones in-between that seem indecipherable.

There seems to be a lot that is good about the movie.  But when I read a few of the 1-star reviews, I was able to both agree and disagree with the criticisms.  Overall, I am giving this episode a high rating because I thought the artistry was fabulous and the good Jedi characters were a very positive feature.  As far as I can tell, even though it tends toward some odd theological concepts, it could very well be a movie that instills just the usual age-old respect for Good triumphant over Evil.  (I haven't heard what church people say about the Star Wars Trilogy.)

Well, I think it is indisputably a FANTASTIC movie, in the full sense of the meaning of the word.",1366502400,2,3523,4.640776699029126
653818,4,6303454038,"Overall, I think that Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is a great movie. I love the fact that they introduce Obi Wan's master, Qui Gon Jinn, although I wish they would have gone into detail about their relationship ( Read Terry Brook's novel version of The Phantom Menace, this book really establishes how strong of a bond these two men have). I also liked learning about Anakin's childhood, and the difficulties of being born a slave along with his mother Shmi. Not to mention, the Boonta Eve Classic podrace scene, and Darth Maul were awesome! Now, of course I will admit that Jar Jar Binks being an up front character kind of ruined the film, but if you overlook that then I think you will be able to enjoy the movie a lot more. Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is an overall good movie, it begins to tell the tale of the decaying Galactic Republic, and it begins Anakin's journey to become a Jedi, and it should be watched more than once!",1366329600,,956,4.4375

653824,4,6303454038,"First thing first, when news came in the mid 90's that a prequel trilogy was coming I was as happy as the next Star Wars fan - only exception was that I never got my hopes up that Lucas would recreate the magic that went into Episodes IV, V, & VI. It was never going to happen - that magic was gone and would never come back......and Lucas wasn't the same guy he was when he wrote the first 3. So right off the bat, I knew that all 3 prequels would be a different set automatically. Most rational fans thought the same.

As far as those ""fans"" and supposed movie buffs claiming everything from ""worst movie ever"" to ""garbage"" either need their heads examined or need to really get out more often and see more movies - because there is a LOT worse things out there. This wouldn't make the top 1,000 worst movies of all time. Supposed movie buffs and fans make me laugh at times. Just to get that out of the way.

Anyway, as far as the current 6 Star Wars movies out there go....yes, this is the worst of the 6.

The casting of Anakin (Jake Lloyd) was bad - he was unlikable in Jingle All the Way and now here he was as a young Darth Vader. The Jar Jar Binks character was terrible and annoying of course. Yes, Lucas put the character in to appeal to the kids in the same way he thought Ewoks appealed to the kids of another generation (really young kids did - my ten year old self didn't really care for them). The pacing was lackluster at best, but still generally a good movie - just a poorish Star Wars movie when compared to Episodes IV, V, and VI.

Overall though, this was NOT a bad movie and any respectable Star Wars fan would agree. Sure, it was a letdown from all the years of nothing, but that should have been expected from the beginning. From an objective standpoint this was still an entertaining movie even through the Lloyd casting, the Binks character, the Gungans, the boring pod race, and the rest of the poorest points of the movie. I've watched it multiple times since it was released and of course own a copy on both DVD and Blu-Ray (along with the others).

Bottom line, if you're a Star Wars fan - you should still find a way to enjoy the movie. But to call this movie ""garbage"" or ""worst movie ever"" is just simply ridiculous. Calling it that means that you just don't watch enough movies. Watch Shark Attack 3 (for starters)and see what truly is worthy of being called ""worst movie ever"" - because this absolutely does NOT deserve that title or anything like it.

If you're a fan of the original trilogy and have yet to see the newer trilogy - keep your expectations realistic that those movies won't be repeated. Just like fans already anticipating that the new trilogy coming from Disney....they may be great, they may be blah, but they will never duplicate the originals. I as a Star Wars fan will see them and not compare them to something they should not be compared to. Check this out with an open mind and I think you'll be ok.",1363305600,2,2959,4.31294964028777

It takes FOREVER for the plot to develop, my four year old was already off and doing other things as I kept promising some eventual action like pod racing and jedi martial arts.  Also and I think by design, the lines between the good guys and bad guys are murky...great if you want to make a political statement...terrible if you want to entertain a child.

653954,5,6303454038,"George Lucas intended the prequel trilogy to be about Anakin, Padme, and Obi-Wan.  But in many ways it turned out to be Palpatine's/Sidious's trilogy, a Sith Trilogy.  Darth Sidious was the Phantom Menace.

At the beginning Sidous had the trade federation blockading his home-world - Naboo. Intending to use the suffering of the Naboo people to remove Valorum and get himself elected Chancelor.

When Sidious learned Obi-Wan and his Master Qui-Gon intended to force an end to the blockade, he naturally ordered them killed.  Instead they escape and reach the planet, where they befriend a Gungan and eventually reached the Naboo capital.

The Jedi rescued Amidala, and persuaded her to seek senate aid on Coruscant. Then they broke the blockade, and escaped into hyperspace.  The Federation needed Queen Amidala to sign a treaty, to legalize their invasion.

Sidious, disappointed over the Trade Federations failure, sent his apprentice - Darth Maul - to track them, and to at last reveal the Sith to the Jedi and the Republic. Maul was eager to battle.

It took Maul awhile to track Amidala and Qui-Gon to Tatooine.  In that time Qui-Gon found a human boy, Anakin Skywalker, in whom the force is stronger than any Jedi.  It was thanks to Anakin that they are able to repair their ship and return to Coruscant.  Maul found them as they were about to leave and nearly prevented their escape, but failed.

When Amidala reached Coruscant, Sidious revised his plans. He realized that she could be convinced to call for a vote of none-confidence of Chancelor Valorum.  Then he could get himself, as Senator Palpatine, elected Chancelor.  His revised plan was successful.

Afterwards Amidala returned to Naboo and convinced the Gungan army to assist her.  Sidious order the Trade Federation to wiped them out.  The result was a vast battle between the battle droids and the gungans.  Maul battled the Jedi. He killed Qui-Gon, and was then cut in half by Obi-Wan. Anakin guided by the force destroyed control ship for the droid army - he saved Naboo.

At the end Palpatine was chancelor. He arrived on Naboo and greeted Obi-Wan and Anakin. As Sidious he was already coveting Anakin as his apprentice.  Willing to be patient,he didn't need to claim Anakin at that point. Sidious let's Obi-Wan teach Anakin about the force.  So when the time is right, all he would need to do is teach him the Dark-Side.",1358294400,3,2394,4.88833746898263

654159,4,6303454038,"Why does Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace receive so much undeserved venom from fans I don't understand. When I heard that George Lucas was making the prequel in the mid-1990's I was so excited. As I said in my three previous Star Wars reviews I loved the flawed Star Wars films and the universe it created, and I highly anticipated The Phantom Menace. At the time I didn't know too much about the cast. Liam Neeson was probably the biggest name I recognized. He was great in the underrated Darkman film. Then there is Schindler's List the film and his performance should speak for themselves, and finally Rob Roy which I saw with my mother and which I think is an unappreciated film. I had didn't know much about Ewan McGregor at the time or his best known film at the time Trainspotting. The only film had seen him in was Nightwatch which is a good thriller. When the film came out I rushed to see it, and loved it. I ended up seeing it 24 times in Alexandria, VA and here in Portland, OR loving it every time. It has its flaws with its biggest being Jar Jar Binks, but those small flaws don't take away from the really good Star Wars film

Everyone should know the plot of this film, so instead I'll talk about some of the complaints people had of the plot and my thoughts of the plot. The biggest outcry by fans and critics is the character Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best). They cry and wine that the character is added nothing to the story, was annoying and just a merchandising tool. First off yes I agree Jar Jar was annoying, could they have toned him down a bit yes, but he was no more annoying than R2-D2 and C-3PO or the Ewoks, but he is important to the plot of the films as a third string character. Finally he wasn't only added for a merchandising tool. I think people judge him way too harshly and rate the film lower because of the character. Sometimes that is the only complaint I hear from fans who hate the film and Lucas is the name Jar Jar Binks, and do you know what I tell them that they aren't true Star Wars fans then. Another complaint is the introduction of midi-chlorians. That I thought really wasn't necessary and took a little bit away from the spirituality of the force. Perhaps the biggest personal complaint I had was they killed off Darth Maul. Just like Boba Fett I loved the character and wish they could have used him in the sequels instead of Count Dooku or maybe they could have found a way to use both of them. The story on a whole was really good with Lucas show us his superb writing ability as he introduced us to classic characters from the original films in Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid who would become the future emperor) along with introducing us great new characters in Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), Padm&eacute; Amidala (Natalie Portman), Darth Maul (Ray Park) and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson). Lucas has an amazing way of writing and developing stories and characters, and he does a great but not perfect job with the Phantom Menace.

The acting job by the entire cast was excellent with Ewan McGregor stealing the show. He did a masterful job playing a young Obi-Wan Kenobi. The beautiful Natalie Portman also had a good performance as Padme, and would give even better performances in the sequels. At the time I didn't remember her being the kid in The Professional or Al Pacino's step-daughter in heat. She really had both beauty and brains which shows in all her acting performances. Ray Park was awesome as Darth Maul and so was Samuel L. Jackson. His character Mac Windo is another character I've come to love. Samuel brought his coolness and awesomeness to the role, and it was great. Just like the originals Frank Oz did an outstanding role as Yoda's voice. Of course Liam Neeson did a great job as the Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn. He displayed his emotion's beautifully from humor and banter with Obi-Wan and his believe in Anakin. Jake Lloyd did a decent but not great job as Anakin, though I wish George had found a better child actor for the role. On a side note I didn't know even till right before I did this review that Keira Knightley played Sabe (Padme's double).

The effects done by ILM (Industrial Light and Magic) were of course outstanding. Everything from the CGI characters to the droid army was done really well. The action was really good, but not great with the climatic lightsaber battle stealing the show. My brother along with some others have said that they thing the lightsaber battle between Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul was better than the one in Star Wars III: The Revenge of the Sith between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. They were both outstanding, but I prefer the lightsaber battle in The Revenge of the Sith. I thought it was better and more intense, and maybe it was better because of the emotional impact. Still the lightsaber battle in The Phantom Menace was great and again Darth Maul is awesome.

The directorial job by George Lucas was good, but not great again proving his detractors wrong. Is he a masterful director no, but he does a good job with actors and story along with the effects. As you would suspect John Williams was great. His score throughout the film was brilliant culminating in the outstanding climatic score that brought to life the lightsaber battle and the battle in general perfectly.

There is no reason for the hatred The Phantom Menace or the rest of the prequels receive. It kind of reminds me of the venom pathetic fans spew about Mass Effect 3. Whining and bitching about the endings which were flawed but still good. They expect that the ending should be done the way they want them to be. Demanding that the ending be change and it worked which is a sad day for video game makers and artists in general. Just because you hate a character doesn't make the film bad. Get over yourselves. Was Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace a perfect or excellent film no, but overall it was a great film with a good story, great characters/acting, beautiful special effects, pretty good directing and excellent music.

654247,2,6303454038,"With 16 years between ""Return of the Jedi"" and this prequel, it was natural the hype would be huge among all avenues of media and especially with the many millions of Star Wars fans around the world. I remember being very excited from the moment I saw the first teaser trailer and the excitement continued to build until I was sitting in the theater among many other fans. The opening music and text started, the people cheered then unfortunately the movie officially started.

Having felt incredible disappointment after the movie ended I and a lot of the fans left just in a fog of how bummed we all were. Since that viewing I've watched the film 3 more times to see if my opinion changed at all and no it has not, and there are a few reasons why.

First the good of the movie, the music by John Williams is top notch, the closing music and the ""Duel of the Fates"" song during the final lightsaber fight are truly great pieces. The special effects for that time were nice and cool.

Unfortunately thats about where the good points stop, the bad is plentiful. Firstly is Jar Jar Binks, many others have said how annoying he was and I can't stress this enough. I can only imagine he was created as a way to entertain kids but most of his antics and lines just made me want to scream out loud at him. The dialogue was quite bad and really just bland on many levels, in fact one of the first lines by Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) sums up the movie ""I have a bad feeling about this"".

The acting is especially disappointing, Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) really just says his lines and doesn't have much in the way of character development or connection to anyone he interacts with especially Obi-Wan and a young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd). McGregor is I guess ok as Obi-Wan but really doesn't do much, Lloyd is one actor who even as a kid was just bad, mind numbingly, brain hurting bad, his lines aren't good and he can't seem to read them even half right to save his life. Natalie Portman who is a fantastic actress I might add, was so bland and boring as the Naboo Queen Amidala, which was pretty sad to see as she actually can act but the dialogue didn't help showcase that.

Jar Jar's race, the Gungans make the Ewoks from ""Return of the Jedi"" seem fun and fesh and not terribly annoying and hair ripping irritating like the animated Gungan race is. None of the humor really works, the only really decent actor in the movie is R2-D2 who conveys more emotion through his series of blips and beeps than most of the cast does combined. The battle droids are especially irritating both voice wise and by their lack of fighting skills and aim, which makes the Storm Troopers seem like a hardened battalion of fighters in comparison.

The action sequences are even dull, the pod race portion takes forever and isn't in the least bit exciting, the only thrill comes when the race is finally over. The lightsaber fights are even mundane even the final one with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan facing a red/black face painted Sith named Darth Maul (Ray Park), who is so evil almost no lengthy screen time is devoted to him. Who needs backstory when you have facepaint and a two edged lightsaber?

I just remember being so bored and angry watching what should've been a very good and thrilling entry into the Star Wars series, turned into this tripe by creator George Lucas who really, really phoned it in on this one. When the bad outweighs the good by that much its better to watch this movie only to mock it since beyond all the technical staff that put who knows how much time into the effects, along with the John Williams score, there seemed to be zero emphasis on dialogue, story or any good acting. *1/2 out of 4 stars.",1348963200,2,3698,4.461538461538462

654251,3,6303454038,"When I first saw ""The Phantom Menace"" in the theaters, I turned to the person I saw it with and said with disgust, ""I can't believe I waited 16 years for this."" Having seen the movie for the first time in years, I cannot say it was as bad as some of its harshest critics insist but it is nowhere near as good as its defenders maintain.

Having watched the DVD, I came to the conclusion that George Lucas attempted to make a movie trying to appeal to two different audiences--members of Generation X who were children when the original trilogy came out and younger kids. Frankly, it undermines the movie. Kids will be turned off by confusing and usually boring hints of political machinations and parliamentary procedure. Adults will find Jar Jar Binks jarring instead of amusing and quickly find Jake Lloyd's role of young Anakin Skywalker grating. While the special effects are impressive, plot and character matter and that is where the movie is lacking.

That is not to say there are some redeeming features. The special effects are generally impressive and some of the battle scenes--especially the final light saber duel--are solid.

The DVD has a host of deleted scenes, most of which would not have added to the film, including making the already long podracing scene stretch on for even more time. There are several documentaries and interviews as well.

With Lucas toying and tinkering with the film--again--the DVD is hard to find on the retail market. Some of the prices currently being asked for--$50 and higher--are absurd.",1344729600,,1536,4.851145038167939

654255,2,6303454038,"Episodes I and II comprise what one might call the nadir of the Star Wars saga.  Episode I illustrates the benefits of a greatly expanded budget and amazing progress in the area of special effects compared to  the first released Star Wars film (1977) later given the title of Episode  IV - ""A New Hope"" which single-handedly and unexpectedly redefined the science-fiction genre of film.  Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was just as revolutionary if not more so in its time nine years earlier but did not create the frenzy of public response as Star Wars did largely due to its not being as much a work of entertainment as it was, and is, a genuine work of art that happens to be in the film medium.

Episode I - ""The Phantom Menace""  -  ends with an impressive battle sequence with labored comical overtones followed by a victory celebration in pretty much the same manner as Episode IV, but this film begins getting into trouble long before that.  Here we have the character Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi knight played by Liam Neeson and his young protg Obi-Wan Kenobi played by Ewan McGregor the latter of whom would be played in his later years in Episode IV by Alec Guinness, one of the relatively few character portrayals of the entire saga having any real depth.

We meet the CGI generated character, Jar Jar Binks, who falls in with the two Jedi characters to everyone's, including the audience's, dismay.  Jar Jar the Bink, the so-called comic relief of the film, seems to be a curious amalgamation of Liberace and Shemp Howard who never seems to know quite when to shut up.

Then we come across the arch villain of Episode IV, Darth Vader, as an eight year old boy played by Jake Lloyd who at this point in his life has the name Anakin Skywalker with the unfortunate nickname, ""Anny.""  I suspect that this could well be a  significant factor leading to his problems later in life.  But his portrayal does not betray any characteristics whatsoever that would have led to the fiend that he is destined to become  -- not even a hint of darkness in his personality.  He is portrayed as a happy little boy who is loved by his mother who was, incidentally, presumably a virgin when she gave birth to him which seems to have a familiar ring to it.  But he shows no signs of ever having been seriously mistreated, even by his boss, an annoying flying insect-like creature who is interested only in money.  Young Anakin is not a loner at all and is popular among his childhood friends.  I think that a far better choice for this part would have been the young actor Daniel Logan, only two years older than Jake Lloyd, having a dark and more serious demeanor, whom  I am  convinced could have developed a more interesting and effecting character.  Logan played the small part of young Baba Fett in Episode 2.  I think with a little coaching he could have developed an Anakin worth watching -- something from which nearly all of the actors in this film would have greatly benefited.  The part of the character who turns out to be Queen Amidala is played by Natalie Portman who, in this film, whines and mumbles to a degree that is excruciating.  In all of these instances the casting director and film director are to blame for allowing these kinds of situations to develop in a high budget film having wide expectations from an enthusiastic public.  The visual highlights include the underwater city, the home of Jar Jar Binks and his people, who show no hints of having evolved from marine creatures.

There is the pod race, which young Anakin wins along with his freedom  to join up with the two Jedi and Jar Jar, which should have tipped him off at the outset to remain at home.  But the two Jedi believe him to have the potential of becoming the greatest of all Jedi.  The pod race sequence is burdened with silly and loud sound effects and wears out its welcome quite some time before it actually ends and ultimately leads to the final battle scene described above which alternates with a light saber fight in which the character played by Liam Neeson is killed.

The well produced visuals of the film cannot compensate for the unforgivably weak script which is only exacerbated by poor casting decisions and inept dramatic direction resulting in unconvincing  performances provided by much of the cast.  George Lucas seemed to be more interested in his toys with the unfortunate result of failing to tell a good story.",1342051200,3,4424,4.616368286445013

If people are complaining about some of the later scenes what they don't understand about this CGI Mona Lisa is that it's stylistically designed to be that way, and while we can't change any of that we can diminish the effects, although I think George may have gone too far in a few places.

And for all you dumb Jar-Jar Binks Haterz, he's the key to all of this, because he's a funnier character, than Star Wars has ever had.

I think that it does an excellent job of explaining how all the main characters first meet and how their relationships start off. There were also several key connections made, like the fact that Anakin built C-3PO. That may have already been known through books or something but if you are just watching the movies, that's the connection of C-3PO.  I thought all the relationships with the characters were strong and you could really see how Anakin fell for Padme and how Anakin even got to become a jedi.  Lucas did a good job with setting up the very beginning of the story and introducing the supporting characters, like Qui-Gon. All cheesiness aside, this movie has something for everyone.  There are a couple of pretty intense fight scenes and then there is the whole podrace. These scenes add some action to an otherwise serious movie.  There is also humor in Jar-Jar and although most people hated his character, I really enjoyed him.  He played the roll of goofball which is something that every movie needs.

654394,3,6303454038,"Now that George Lucas has repackaged his 6 episode chronicle Star Wars it is no surprise that he puts them all out there again in a 3-D format.  This is the first film chronologically and also the first to hit the theaters.  It's also the worst, regardless of the format.  It was always baffling to me why Lucas would begin a story in the middle but obviously he thought it all through and for better or worse, it all begins here.  Unfortunately, the movie is dumbed down to the lowest common denominator, young kids.  From a marketing and general business practice, I get it but from a critical perspective, I don't.

We meet young (11?) Anakin Skywalker (terrible Jake Lloyd) who of course becomes Luke and Leia's father and becomes Darth Vader.  We also meet Anakin's future wife and mother of the siblings, Queen Padme Amidala (lovely but stiff Natalie Portman).  Much has been made of the introduction of the awful Jar Jar Binks character and yes he drove me crazy.  There is also the issue of the warring tribe of droid soldiers and Gungans.  Compare these with the warriors in ""Lord of the Rings."" Childish.

There are some moments in the movie however that does stand up.  First, the pod race.  Yes, it has a bizarre comic book look, full of odd-ball non-threatening characters but the race itself is well done both visually and sonically. And it is also the one high point of the 3-D theatrical version.  The other high point was the brief introduction of the original protg of the evil emperor Sidious.  Played by Ray Park he is one of the great, but short-lived, characters of the Star Wars saga.  I was also surprised at how quickly Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) is written out of the story line after this episode.

As far as the 3-Dness of the theatrical production.  It was definitely toned down, too much I thought for a colorful in-your-face style movie as this.  It doesn't take much away in terms of the viewing but it is darker and of course more expensive.  Is it worth it?  Nope.  For anyone familiar with the Star Wars series your mind is already made up about this first prequel.

Good special effects and fun action scenes.
While this is entitled Star Wars, is written and directed by George Lucas, and does contain all the elements and ""pre"" characters (i.e. young Obi-wan, young Darth Vader, Yoda, etc) that were found in the original Star Wars films, do not think of this as a REAL Star Wars movie. Better, think of it as one of those shameless rip-off of big budget movies, straight-to-DVD releases you see whenever you walk into your local video store to rent a movie. That is to say, while this does contain elements that are supposed to lead up to the birth of Darth Vader, do not take ANYTHING in this (or the oter prequel) seriously, as for strange unknown reasons George Lucas decides to throw in a lot of very strange and completely senseless plot holes and explanations of why things exist in the Star Wars universe. One example being the strange explanation of the Force, and where it comes from. Just ignore all of it. Take this movie as a 2 hour romp of cute special effects and big budget light-saber action.

654600,1,6303454038,"I don't see how anyone can rate this movie higher than one star if you're a Star Wars fan over 7 years old. This movie was horrible, a complete disgrace to the Star Wars name. Had this move been made in the 80's, it would've been completely different. Lucas relied on CGI too much in the new trilogy and let the story go down the toilet. The acting was too cardboard. Hell, even Oscar nominee Natalie Portman seemed like she just walked on the set for the first time. You never really cared for the characters.

Now, let's get into the story.

Starting from the first scene, the battle droids were a complete failure. If Lucas wanted to change from soldiers to droids for the villain infantry, fine. But don't make them skinny, tin can pieces of crap. They sounded and acted like they should be on a Saturday morning cartoon. They weren't intimidating at all and even if they weren't meant to be, their goofy banter served no purpose in the movie. The opening scene with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon started out well with some good action and witty lines, but quickly dissolved after that, never to return.

Now enter Jar Jar. Quite possibly the worst decision ever made for the Star Wars franchise. How anyone watched the scenes in pre-production and was like, ""Yeah, that's good. People will find this funny. Let's wrap it up"" is beyond me. His antics did nothing to progress the story along and only had the power to make 5 year olds laugh. Even my 8 year old cousin said that he though he heard that line on Darkwing Duck at one time.

Then they meet Anakin, the eventual great and powerful Sith Lord, Darth Vader. The kid who grew up in poverty as a slave, abused, torn from his mother, anger building up throughout his tumultuous childhood, right? .....uh, no. He built droids and podracers, hung out with his friends, lived with his mom and was fed regularly. This is the child that became Darth Vader and slaughtered Jedi. For what reason again? His ""slave owner"" made him race in a podrace? What he loved doing? Oh, the humanity. I didn't really understand we why had to see Anakin from that young of an age.

Now, on to the inconsistencies. Anakin built C-3PO.....really? Ok, Mr. Lucas. You're the one who created this, but it just doesn't make sense with the original trilogy. I'm surprised Lucas didn't try and sneak Han Solo and Chewbacca in there somehow. We don't need every character from the original trilogy added in. C-3PO shouldn't have made it in till at least the last movie, if at all, imo. Vader doesn't recognize C-3PO? C-3PO doesn't know what Vader became? R2-D2 rides around with Obi-Wan, yet in ""A New Hope"" he doesn't recognize the little droid? Weird. Whatever you say. I'm not even going to get started on the midichlorians and the Force. Any Star Wars fan that watched that threw up a little in there mouth. If they hadn't already by the time Jar Jar and little Ani stunk up the place.

In conclusion, everything just seemed so rushed and you felt like they had some huge storyline laid out, but just felt like doing the cliff notes for it so the CGI could be show every minute of the movie. With the right tweaks, it could've been an ok movie. You know, like replace Jar Jar with a character that mattered and didn't want to make me pull me ears off. The CGI was great and the big battle between the Gungans and battle droids had real potential. Then comes Jar Jar on his ""white horse"" and ruins that whole scene. The fight scene between Maul, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan was fantastic. Too bad that was towards the end of the film and by that time I was already ready for the movie to be over.",1314662400,9,3610,4.487062404870624

654602,5,6303454038,"From a true fan of Star Wars

The ""phantom menace"" was to me what ""a new hope"" was to the baby boomers. The original trilogy was about Luke Skywalker. The new trilogy is about the Jedi and Anakin Skywalker. The new trilogy is almost like what Jesus was to the pharasee's, but Jesus was God and thus Star Wars the new trilogy is Star Wars. The truth is that a lot of reviewers get it wrong and don't understand what Star Wars is truly about. The opening credits give it away. Star Wars is about ""in a galaxy far far away."" Star Wars is a universe that anything could happen in: people, plot, etc. It is not limited to Luke Skywalker. Also if the Star Wars pharisees(those who hated the prequels) actually looked into the back stories of each of the characters then the prequels match up. The truth be said, all the Star Wars pharisee's don't truly like Star Wars. They like the image of Star Wars, but not the true spirit of Star Wars. When I saw Episode 1 in theaters I was like ""wow! This is great"" The movie started out perfectly too. I loved it up until the end and I had seen the original trilogy too. My grown mother liked it and she was a huge Star Wars. But then again thats the reaction you get from a really Star Wars fan and not a fake Star Wars fan. Also I find it funny how people argue the stupidness of the new trilogy when in reality the original trilogy had so much more stupidity in it then the new trilogy. Also with episode 2, I really think that the reason why the romance between Anakin and Padame seemed horrible was because all George Lucas was doing was showing how dumb people can be at romance, even in a galaxy far far away.

654604,5,6303454038,"So my 8 year old daughter and I sat down and watched all six Star Wars films over the course of a week. I had waited some time to show her these movies because some of the scenes are pretty intense, but since she's a clever and surprisingly mature girl, I was fairly certain she could handle it when she expressed her usual, unbridled enthusiasm to watch the saga.

After all, I was 8 myself when my father took our family to see Star Wars back in 1977. He told my brother and I that it was an important film we needed to see. To say it made an impact on me - and by extension, my generation - would be an understatement, but this isn't about my experience and what I felt the first time I saw it. I've been talking about that stuff for more than thirty years now. This is about what my daughter experienced having seen all six films this week.

Before I continue I will say one thing, however. I like both the originals and the prequels. I'm not a disgruntled fanboy by any means. But for years I have been made to feel by people my own age that I should be unhappy with what Lucas did with episodes 1-3. But the truth is, I don't feel unhappy. In fact, I love them as much as I love the originals. So when my daughter and I sat down to watch the films, I watched her as much as I did the movies, and she confirmed for me a few suspicions I've been having all these years.

She loved the story line, the jokes, the droids, and especially Jar-Jar, who came across as a wonderfully comic actor; was frightened and dazzled by many of the aliens and monsters; instantly fell in love with Padme but was also charmed by Anakin and his selflessness. The pod race had us on the edge of our seats, and the accomplishments of someone her age made her more excited about her own possibilities than I could have anticipated.

And after seeing her reactions I realized something; Lucas' legacy is in safe hands; the people who dislike these films obviously came to the theater with expectations and disappointed themselves in the process. They've spent more time whining about what the films could have been than simply enjoying them. My daughter's joy was all the proof I needed that Lucas got it right. And I have yet to meet a child her age, or any teenager (or twenty something for that matter), who hasn't been delighted with the films from start to finish.",1307145600,10,2350,4.3099547511312215
654605,2,6303454038,"I had planned to keep The Phantom Menace from my son for as long as possible, but he's four now and into everything Star Wars, and it was playing on Spike TV this weekend, and...well, he's been exposed. And at the same time, I've been re-exposed, and although I appreciate the visual effects, I can't help but think how unnecessarily complicated it is. Star Wars (that is, the inanely retitled ""A New Hope"") was simple without being overly simplistic. It was a fantastic example of good storytelling. It also benefited from Lucas's lack of time and money: He simply couldn't include every little thing he wanted to, so he had to streamline the story--and it all worked for the better. On The Phantom Menace, on the other hand, Lucas was free to indulge himself, with no limits on budget, and no one to say ""No."" End result: a huge, noisy, visually sumptuous mess.

I wrote the following shortly after seeing TPM in the theater for the first time. Other than changing ""Disney"" to ""Hanna-Barbera,"" which is more accurate and reflects my great respect for Disney and my ambivalence toward H-B, it remains unchanged--and relevant.

What we have here is a poorly written story, acted out by great actors (Jake Lloyd excepted) with fantastic special effects and a whole mess of stupid (as in unintelligent) aliens. Star Wars was an adult movie, written for adults, that happens to resonate with kids because it encompasses universal desires and themes (getting off the farm, becoming a hero). TPM is a kids' movie; it's a Hanna-Barbera cartoon; it's lowest-common-denominator filmmaking at its most expensive. For some unfathomable reason, Lucas decided that he needed to please every conceivable audience member with this movie (including every kid alive), and he managed to upset quite a few of them. (Jar Jar Binks is just annoying, and completely worthless to the story; Boss Nass, however, is one step removed from Uncle Remus. Heck, you might as well put spears in the hands of the Gungans and put them in blackface. Maybe they'll do it in twenty years for the Special Edition. And don't get me started on the Trade Federasians.)

So let's talk logic: How does a little slave boy manage to haul two huge engines and a pod to his backyard, and how did his master not know about it? How did he pay for them? What's the point of having a slave if you just let him go home to Mommy at night? How did two sniveling, cowardly incompetents make it to the top of the supposedly ruthless Trade Federation? (""Oh! Jedi coming! Crows de brast doors!"")

Worthy opponents? All the bad guys, except for Palpatine (and Ian McDiarmid brings a lot to the role), are cardboard cutouts. They're all stupid and just plain evil--even Darth Maul, whose sole purpose is to look cool while he's fighting. They could have dumped Maul and let Sidious do the fighting. (Qui-Gon sees under the hood and there's a flash of recognition in QG's eyes as he dies...) In Star Wars, by contrast, everyone was pretty dang smart--notably the bad guys. Luke was naive at first, but he wasn't stupid. And no one was in the movie just to provide comic relief--all the laughs arose naturally from the situations: ""Listen to them, they're dying, Artoo!"" (See ""tension and release."")

Worse, in TPM, almost everything happens BY ACCIDENT (despite what Qui-Gon Jinn says about there not being any accidents--and no wonder, since their whole universe seems to be one accident after another): Jar Jar accidentally wastes a bunch of droids while kicking one off; Jar Jar accidentally drops exploding balls on the droids, saving his people; Anakin accidentally flies into the droid control ship and accidentally blows up the power generators. This, my friends, is no way to plot a movie. Accidents and coincidences are the plot devices of hack writers.

Look, I was the biggest Star Wars fan alive, once. I still love to watch it, and it still gets me ""right here"" when I do. [Although now I will only watch Adywan's ""Star Wars: A New Hope Revisited.""] Star Wars (I can't bring myself to call it ""A New Hope"") was a solid piece of filmmaking, one of my top three favorites of all time. TPM looked like my Star Wars and it sounded like my Star Wars, but it lacked the soul of my Star Wars. I couldn't connect. If you can, that's fantastic. In fact, I envy you. Because I just can't look past the glaring faults and huge plot holes and say that it was--in any sense other than being an entertaining diversion for two hours--a good movie.",1306886400,3,4486,4.722860791826309
654606,5,6303454038,"That is truly the only reason to enjoy or watch the three prequel sequels.  Basic plot is they discover young Darth Vadar and nurture him for his hidden talents, until he becomes betrayed by circumstance mainly due to his mother's death, and the impending doom of his betrothed wife.  His utter frustration at not being able to save his mother, and then trying to find ways to divert his true love from dying, takes him over the edge to the dark side, in order to find untapped power that the Jedi shun.
Being this is the first installment of all that, it's about the very young Skywalker.  I disagree that the young boy should have shown traits of evil at an early stage to prove his ability to become Darth Vadar, as his experience in life at this point is limited to his good upbringing, with a loving caring thoughtful mother, even in unusual circumstance.  Gifted children don't have to come from unbalanced homes, but a swift kick of betrayal in spite of his early blessings, might just change his mind to continue being goody two shoes. All in all, these three movies do little more to explain anything about the Star Wars world, other than spotlight young Skywalker falling from grace as he ages to a young man.  The rest is all gibberish, to say the least. The true highlight here is the pod race, in second, concluding battle in the ring, and third, well, it's all about noise.",1306195200,,1387,4.532

654743,2,6303454038,"As I watched The Phantom Menace in it's first days on the big screen I kept trying to find a reason to like it.  I told myself, great special effects, good use of computer graphics...  But I realized the cause was lost when Qui-Gon and Obi-wan were in an underwater chase scene with a giant fish and I hoped the fish would catch and eat them.  Each hero seemed a cardboard cut out of superman at various ages dressed in desert rags.  There was super boy, super young man, super dad, super wise man.  Okay, they had obvious super powers, but I didn't like any of them .  The ""King"" was there, dressed in splendid robes, but he was a bored caricature of his former self. I preferred the scoundrel Han and naive young Luke both reluctant heroes wanting to impress a very believable princess, and all three on a journey of self discovery.  In the original trilogy the special effects were fine robes on characters I would want as friends.  It was American Graffiti in space.  Unfortunately, the Phantom Menace contaminated the second movie.  It seemed stuck in the ruts of the first, great special effects clothing wooden or unlikeable characters.  I only bought the third movie of this trilogy on DVD but I am the happy owner of the original (unrenovated) trilogy in both VHS and DVD.  I hope Mr. Lucas rediscovers the value of the human condition that he displayed so well in American Graffiti and then in the original Star Wars trilogy.",1300060800,,1435,4.5625
654744,4,6303454038,"I feel that I should get one thing out of the way before this review really gets underway. I never saw this film in theaters. I never rented it when it initially came out on VHS and DVD. I saw this film AFTER I saw Episodes II and III. In fact, I didn't see Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace until late in 2010. So, my experience with the film will undoubtedly be different from most who read this review.

I love Star Wars. Well, the films anyway. I tried reading the Expanded Universe novels and comic books, only to have them slowly and deliberately annihilate everything I enjoyed about that characters and Galaxy I had come to adore. But, back on topic, I love the original trilogy of films. I grew up with them and I continue to enjoy them (the original theatrical versions) to this day. So, I was more than excited to see this film, but for some reason, I just never got around to seeing it until just recently. And I enjoyed it immensely.

If you're reading this, and you despise this movie, if the very thought of it makes your blood boil, I can understand. I'll never tell you that I can't, in some way, get where you're coming from. The Phantom Menace is very flawed, one could argue fundamentally so. I'm more than willing to admit that. But, I still enjoy it. I won't defend it (though there are a few arguments I could refute) and I won't call you out, but I did genuinely enjoy this entry into the Star Wars saga.

First, lets' look at the failings of the film. First is the writing. While I personally enjoyed the story of The Phantom Menace, the writing is, well, rather shoddy. Hell, the dialogue is downright MST3K worthy at times and the way in which the plot is told can be quite head-scratching at times. I really think the plot should have been presented in more straightforward fashion, but instead Lucas attempted what I think was supposed to be non-linear storytelling and wound up muddling things up a bit. Certain things, such as the Trade Federation's reason(s) for joining Palpatine remain unexplained (which is really a sticking point since EVERYONE else's motivations are explained). This isn't helped by scenes (chiefly the Pod Race) that go on for WAY too long. Some careful scene trimming would have been nice, George.

Next, and I really hate to jump so late onto a bandwagon point, is Jar Jar. I have never been so annoyed with a character in a film. I can understand why Lucas put him in, but dear god. A character that inept, that oafish, that utterly boorishly stupid deserves all the problems they step into. I'm sorry, but I really hate Jar Jar Binks.

Finally, we have the children. Oi. Normally, acting doesn't mean as much to me as it does to others, but in this case i have to make an exception. Why is Anakin, sorry, ""Annie"" so young? Why are there 17 hyperbullilion children in this film? And does every one of their actors have to be as godawful as they are? Good lord, these are the worst child actors I've ever scene. I swear, I'll be hearing ""Annie's"" cries of 'Yippie!' in my nightmares 'til doomsday.

Now, most folks would think, after those bullet points, that I would hate this film. Not so. I like the Phantom Menace despite it's flaws. I normally don't enjoy films for the ""experience"", I'm usually at the core working the plot/direction/writing/characters bits, but there are a few movies out and about that have provided me with an excellent experience that I get totally absorbed into, and The Phantom Menace is one such film. The music, the CG-organic effects, the characters, the music everything just weave together to give me that Star Wars feel and I get totally sucked in. It's far, FAR from perfect, and it's not as good the original three entries, but Episode One is a worthwhile and fun entry into the mythic Star Wars saga.",1298937600,3,3803,4.536443148688047
654745,4,6303454038,"I thought this movie was better than the other prequels because alot of real environments were used (such as Mos Espa) rather than green screens.
Although using computer graphics for the droids may have been cool in 1999; today the computer models look worse than in some video games I've played.

I think everyone agrees this movie could have been better, and more could have been done with Darth Maul, however I still think its a pretty cool movie.",1294531200,2,450,4.69620253164557

654747,3,6303454038,"I finally watched this much-maligned movie this week (only 10 years late!) after missing it in theaters because of the hype beforehand and the vitriolic condemnation it got from all my friends.  I don't see what all the fuss was about.  It's a standard run-of-the-mill big budget product from the late-1990s Hollywood Crap Factory, long on action and spectacle... and miserably deficient in everything else.  It was actually more entertaining than I expected, based on how badly it was panned by everybody I know.  But then again, I hadn't invested my entire emotional well-being in unrealistic hopes for this movie.  If you pretend that you don't know anything about Star Wars and Episode I is your first experience of it, then the movie is okay.

Unfortunately I DO know something about Star Wars, and just ""okay"" is not hardly enough.  The difference between this and the original trilogy is in the writing - and mainly in character development.  None of the characters in Episode I are developed AT ALL.  I have no sense of who they are or what might be their motivations; they are just people reciting dialogue.  I know practically nothing more about Obi-Wan Kenobi than I knew before watching this.  The supposedly ""bad mofo"" villain Darth Maul is not even a character - he's a stunt dummy.  I think he said a total of 10 words in the entire movie.  I have absolutely no idea who he was, where he came from, what was his purpose - he was a complete non-entity and I found myself not caring in the least about his ultimate fate.  The same goes for all the other characters.  Unlike the original trilogy, which made me know the characters and care about what happened to them, this movie made everybody seem like emotionless puppets.  The best-developed character among a cast of wooden mannequins turns out, unfortunately, to be Jar-Jar Binks.

The same lackluster quality extends also to the plot.  In Episode IV it seemed awfully important to stop the Empire because they were CLEARLY bad guys with an undeniably EVIL plan.  Darth Sidious's evil scheme in Episode I is sort of inscrutable.  His behind-the-scenes machinations look like normal politics to me; shady, devious, but not obviously evil enough to make me root against the guy.  Meanwhile, Queen Amidala trots across the galaxy in a haphazard ""I keep changing my mind"" way which ends with the inevitable victory by the good guys (accomplished with almost childlike ease, making suspension of disbelief difficult to maintain.)  Oh, and during this journey they happen to find a child who would be totally uninteresting if we didn't already know he grows up to be Darth Vader.  And we waste about 20 minutes on an unnecessary pod race sequence.  The race was viscerally exciting but it didn't contribute to the plot in a meaningful way.

It's clear that resources which should have been invested in writing and acting were lavished instead on CG effects.  Lots of action + no emotional resonance = two hours of empty, unsatisfying eye-candy.  I suppose the filmmakers were counting on using the Force (i.e. Star Wars fans' unquestioning devotion) to carry audiences past the movie's deficiencies.  It didn't work.  George Lucas cannot take all the blame for this colossal failure to live up to his past glory, because the end credits list the names of hundreds of people involved in this production ... scores of creative individuals who had the opportunity (and the responsibility) to say ""Wait a second, Mr. Lucas.""  But apparently nobody did.

Ah well.  If you lower your expectations, this movie is watchable - even enjoyable to a certain degree.  A solid 3-star product.",1293667200,5,3640,4.885807504078303

654842,3,6303454038,"I remember all the hype leading up to the theatrical release of this movie and after 16 years of waiting, the prequels had finally arrived.  I had my doubts from seeing the trailers which didn't look that good, and I should have known from what went wrong with much of Return of the Jedi that it would translate over to these new movies.  The first two Star Wars movies were so effective partially because George Lucas was not given as much autonomy which in reality made the movies so much better.  If you have seen the earlier scripts for Star Wars you would see how silly some of his ideas were.  With Return of the Jedi, George Lucas was free to do whatever he wanted, and his silliness and eccentricities were poured forth strongly within Jabba's palace and the whole Ewok thing.  So after such a long wait, the Phantom Menace arrives.  I was very anxious to see it, but I had my doubts.  Afterward, I did enjoy it, but there were many things I did not like about it.  The story in many ways contradicts the information that we did know about Anakin that Obi-Wan explained to Luke in ROTJ: ""When I met your father he was already a great pilot (not a podracer).  I was amazed how strong he was in the force...I took it upon myself to train him...I was not as good as Yoda was"" etc.  So I really had a problem with Anakin being as young as he was.  I always imagined Anakin being around Luke's age in the first movie, but more of a Han Solo type in his humor and recklessness; yet noble, but with a dark side with his temper and stubbornness.  His character would be likeable and he would seem like one of those guys you would love to have around (thus making his future fall that much more tragic).  The story of Padme being the elected Queen of Naboo at age 16 was ridiculous; her costume was plain silly.  I see her story taking place on Alderaan, as a princess of the ruling family that was close to Bail Organa.  There was a lot of time wasted in this movie with stories that did not matter to the saga as a whole:  Jar Jar Binks and the Gungans, the fish chasing the ship, the Gungan battle, etc.  I really think that a lot of this frivolous storyline could have been eliminated and elements of Episode II incorporated into it so we could see more of the Clone Wars in the next movie.  Lucas wasted too much time and as a result we are stuck watching cartoons to see more of a sensationalized version of the Clone Wars.  The Jedi Council was ridiculous with all of its bizarre creatures (like the thing with the long neck) and Yoda's insistence that he sees anger and fear in Anakin but it is not substantiated.  I don't like Anakin and his mother being slaves and there should have had a connection with the Lars family right away (and sincere disagreement from Owen Lars with Anakin being involved with the Jedi, etc).  The Podrace was cool, but I think a skyhopper race would have been more appropriate and Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan could have felt how strong Anakin was in the force right away while descending upon the planet and chancing upon the race.  Elements of Episode II could have been incorporated with Mace Windu doing (Obi-Wan's) investigation into the cloning facility.  The entire trade federation battle was a waste and there could have been a better way to incorporate Anakin as a pilot without doing a shoddy remake of the first attack on the Death Star.  The movie is full of annoying characters: the Gungans, the Trade Federation and the battle droids, Watto, Padme's advisors, etc.  I would have scrapped about 70% of this movie.  The midi-Chlorian concept should have been trashed as well.  C3PO and R2-D2 were always intended to be in all of the movies, but I don't like the idea of Anakin being the one that created C3PO - it just doesn't fit.  The only bright spot to the movie is Darth Maul and the lightsaber battles which are spectacular.  I believe he should have lived in order to establish Anakin's skills in the next movie by Anakin defeating him, but underestimating Dooku who surprises him and dismembers him before escaping.

In retrospect I think ""The Phantom Menace"" is a failure and George Lucas really messed up this movie and forever contradicted the original storyline.  It's sad that the man that started such an amazing universe sabotaged his own creation including his constant tinkering with the original trilogy.  There are too many gratuitous references to the classic trilogy that don't belong in the movie; I think George Lucas got lost in his own universe and really missed the mark.  I'd love to see someone do a remake and really do the prequels some justice.  There are plently of graphic novels and books that do George Lucas' universe more justice than the man himself.",1285286400,2,4730,4.519388954171563

654844,1,6303454038,"I should make it clear that though I am fan of the original three Star Wars movies, I do not hate the prequel movies out of some kind of fanatical fanboy reaction. I just don't like the films because they are not good films.

Defense of this film and the other two follow-ups has been fierce in the wake of wrath from many disappointed fans and haters of Jar Jar Binks. Prior to its release, I understand that some die-hard fans showed their loyalty to the Star Wars franchise by paying out over $500 to see the premiere of ""Episode III: Revenge of the Sith."" If you paid $500 for a crappy movie, you'd defend it rather than admit you wasted a buttload of dinero.

Phantom Menace: A Phantom Movie

The Phantom Movie has a ghost of a plot and a phantasm of characterization. Mainly, it is just one long joyless ride of mediocrity relying more on flash than substance. As many critics and fans have pointed out over the years, the first three movies may have had many flaws but they were overall good films with interesting characters and a simple but engaging plot.

Some people gripe about ""Return of the Jedi"" because one of the most controversial moments in the original trilogy has to be the introduction of the Stone Age teddy bears known as the Ewoks. However, one really has to admit that Jar Jar Binks of ""Episode I"" redeems the Ewoks; at least some of those teddy bears had the decency to die and you couldn't understand them when they were talking.

The original Star Wars films had enormous success and popular acceptance because they were grounded in ancient primal myths that people from all generations and cultures could relate to. In addition, the first three films are nostalgic of 1950s and 1930s sci-fi adventures films and serials. There is a lot of just sheer, campy fun lines like, ""I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you!""

Nothing like this in ""Episode I."" Dialog is appallingly poor and lifeless. The characters are uninteresting, with the exception of the rarely seen Darth Maul -- and even he comes off second best to Boba Fett of the original films. Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan character has far less screen time in ""Star Wars"" than Liam Neeson's practically unpronounceable Jedi character. And yet Obi-Wan's death had far more impact on audiences than the latter's because Obi-Wan was more of a recognizable, developed character an audience could feel for. I felt Neeson's character was a stranger throughout the whole movie, more cardboard than Jedi. I sometimes forget that he even died in the movie, his character being so forgettable as it was. I don't blame Neeson for this. I blame poor storytelling and characterization.

Perhaps I'm getting too old for special-effects eye candy, but I found the CGI in the film overbearing and fake. Give me the old clunky-looking models and men-in-rubber-suit aliens. It seems that when Lucas and company had less money and technology they were forced to be more creative. Now blessed (or cursed) with an abundance of both, the end result is Jar Jar Binks, one of the most hated sidekicks to darken the silver screen. As for the battle robots, they are wimpy-looking talking broomsticks with guns.

The humor of ""Episode I"" is degrading and pandering to kids with primarily all of it delivered by Jar Jar through poor slapstick routines Buster Keaton would have been nauseated by. The humor of the first three films works mainly because there is chemistry among the characters.

The story of ""Episode I"" doesn't hold interest well either. We have a plot about a blockade over trade regulations (at last! economics and sci-fi!) and a kid with extraordinary powers but possessing all the personality and charm of a piece of furniture.

Then there's the very subtle sub-plot of Darth Maul that's so sub it's practically a submarine. And there's just too much repetition in certain scenes, such as the underwater voyage on Naboo, as big fish devour big fish, and the overly long, never-thought-it-would-end pod-racing scene. Perhaps NASCAR racing fans liked it.

Overall, things happen more by blind dumb luck rather than by the Force, such as Anakin blowing up the mother ship completely by accident. And speaking of the Force, gone is the mystical, Zen-like idea that so grabbed audiences and pop culture of the past. Instead we have a scientific Star Trek interpretation of the Force as some kind of blood disease.

One of the biggest problems I had with the film was Anakin Skywalker, often lovingly referred to by many critics as ""Manakin Skywalker."" Jake Lloyd's acting abilities aside, presenting the future Darth Vader as a kid is not so crucial that a whole film should be devoted to it. The ""Episode I"" storyline could have been easily condensed down to about 15-20 minutes at the beginning of ""Episode II: Attack of the Clones.""

The story behind the prequels is the fall and transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader. But a child is not an interesting character for the type of overall story George Lucas presented in these newer films. I would rather have had Anakin first revealed as a youth in his mid to late teens as a flawed but sympathetic hero who slowly descends in the course of the three prequels into darkness as of result of his own decisions and things outside of his control. And at absolutely no point should he shout ""Yippee!"" no matter how well he does something.

A few other notes of irritated concern:

Why do the robots in the film need to talk out loud to each other?

Why did they have Hugh Quarshie all funked up like a 1970s chauffeur for a pimp? (referring to the Queen of Naboo's bodyguard's highly questionable fashion)

How come Obi-Wan forgot about C3PO and R2D2 in later years? Was it Jedi senility? (I know the answer: They were just in the film to establish a flimsy continuity. Logic isn't even an option).

And for that matter, how come Darth Vader doesn't remember Tatooine? Dark Side senility?

Why would the rest of the Republic delegates give a toss for a backwater world like Naboo and call for a new election of their leader, Supreme Chancellor Valorum (Terence Stamp)?

How is 7 or 8 too old for Jedi training? Do they have an embryo training academy? (And just forget the fact that Luke made some considerable progress in a couple of years from farm boy able to lift only small household objects to Jedi superhero challenging the Emperor and Darth Vader.)

How come all the Naboo pilots look like close-to-retirement office workers seemingly without an ounce of combat training and wearing only safety glasses and leather baseball caps? (They looked like the clueless adults in Disney movies that the hideously adorable kids have to fill in on what is really going on.)

Why did Obi-Wan lie about his first meeting with Anakin? Anakin was not the best pilot in the galaxy when they first met; he was a wet-behind-the-ears, 10-year-old domestic servant.

Overall Phantom Menace was a disappointment both as a Star Wars film and just as a film period.",1282435200,6,6981,4.775103734439834
654845,3,6303454038,"When Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace came out in May 1999, some people said the movie sucks.  Some people said they liked it, while others said it was just ""OK"".  Well, that's how it's been for the last eleven years.  This is a movie that has gotten mixed reviews.  What's my opinion of this movie?

It's OK, that's all.  So...it gets 3 stars.

This is a movie that could have been so much better, but George Lucas botched it up.  There are a number of reasons, so I'll explain.

First of all, the script.  Oh, the script, the script, the script.  The script is HORRIBLE!!!!!  George Lucas wrote one draft and then gave it the stamp of approval.  I don't get it.  It's so wordy.  This is a movie that the average person is not going to be able to memorize, unlike the scripts from episodes IV, V, and VI (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return Of The Jedi).

Second of all, midi-chlorians.  Why was this concept used to give a scientific explanation for The Force?  Why was The Force explained at all?

Third of all, wooden acting.  A lot of the characters are so stiff, so wooden, and so boring.  I know the political talk isn't the most exciting subject matter in the world, but at least have the characters show a little emotion and personality.

Fourth of all, the higher technology.  Why is the technology more sophisticated and superior to the technology from episodes IV, V, and VI?  This movie is supposed to take place 40 years before Episode IV - A New Hope, yet the technology seems like it would be more suited for a movie that takes place 40 years after Episode VI - Return Of The Jedi.  The only hint of inferior technology in The Phantom Menace is that of ships needing help from a ""booster"" to go into hyperspace.

Fifth of all, the slaying of Darth Maul.  What on Naboo was that?  Obi-Wan Kenobi is hanging on for dear life several feet below where Darth Maul is standing and looking down at him.  Suddenly Kenobi looks in the direction of where Qui-Gon's lightsabre is lying on the floor.  My question is this:  With Kenobi several feet below floor level, how can he see Qui-Gon's lightsabre from that vantage point?  The lightsabre is completely out of his view.  Does he have X-ray vision?  Another thing - Why does Darth Maul just stand there and watch as Kenobi jumps up, grabs the lightsabre, and swipes him?  Maul had every opportunity to swipe Kenobi in those several seconds.

Why was Darth Maul killed off to begin with?  He's one of my favorite characters in the entire six movie saga!

Sixth of all, Jar Jar Binks.  Oooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh Jar Jar Binks.  He was SO annoying.  He was meant to provide comic relief in place of R2D2 and C3PO, seeing that C3PO was being built at the time and was not a companion of R2D2 yet.  Instead, he single-handedly ruined the movie, or at least came pretty darn close.  Plus, I didn't find him that funny.  It was dry humor at best.  He was meant to appeal to little kids.  I really believe that if I was seven years old when this movie came out I wouldn't like Binks.  Seriously.  If there was a Worst Movie Characters Of All Time Hall Of Fame, Jar Jar Binks would be a first ballot Hall Of Famer.

Seventh of all, Anakin Skywalker.  Jake Lloyd was given a script to act like the little kid he was.  Not entirely his fault.  His character showed no hint of possibly developing an evil side in the future, not even in the most subtle way.  His character comes off as very child-like and uninteresting and shallow, for the most part.  His interaction with Padme is awkward.

Eighth of all, the pod race was too long.  It was great visually, but I get the feeling that George Lucas wanted to just show off what he can do with CGI technology, which leads me into my next point...

Ninth of all, there was too much CGI technology.  George Lucas fell in love with CGI technology and overused it.  That's why the technology in the galaxy far, far away is so much more sophisticated in the prequels compared to episodes IV, V, and VI.  It makes no sense.

Overall, the movie is just OK.  There are some strong points to it, but the negatives outweigh the positives.  Some of the positives are the musical score by John Williams, which I feel is one of the best scores in the whole six movie saga, the high intensity lightsabre fights with Kenobi, Jinn, and Maul, and the battle scenes on Naboo are visually stunning (just pretend Jar Jar isn't in those scenes).  I also like a lot of the costumes, such as Queen Amidala's arsenal and Darth Maul's.

I dismiss this movie as basically a kiddie flick.  There are lots of kids in this movie, unlike the original trilogy, which didn't have any kids that I can remember.  I think George Lucas deliberately loaded up Episodes I, II, and III with kids so he could market all the toys to the kids through the movie itself.  But it's funny how Episodes IV, V, and VI appealed so much to kids, yet the movies didn't have any kids in them.  My point is that you don't need to include kids in these movies in order for the movies to appeal to kids.  The CHARACTERS are what get the kids interested, not some no-name kids who are taking up room on the screen.  Think of characters like R2D2, C3PO, Darth Vader, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, the Jawas, etc.  Also, the spaceships and weapons get kids interested as well.

All the scenes that are supposed to be ""funny"" instead come off as childish.  There are a lot of distracting things that appear on the screen throughout the movie, thanks to Lucas getting carried away with CGI.  Everything is overdone.  Also, a lot of the characters are just plain funny looking.

I was glad that George Lucas bounced back and got back on track with Episode II - Attack Of The Clones, and better yet, Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith.

Strike that.

But like Maul and every character save Obiwan in this film he lacks any dimension to which the viewer really could get into it like you have insight into who they are and what their motives are.  They are simply strangers from the beginning to the end.  Wooden dialogue is a curse of this film that is also seen in Episode 2, whoever that film is slightly better in delivery.  The character of Obiwan is portrayed by McGregor who gives the character depth by simply getting above a monotone vocal range when speaking.  Most of the characters speak like grade schoolers reciting a local play for the first time.  The plot isn't terribly bad, its the manner by which its delivered and filmed that makes it so bad.  Seens are too big and deliver is too bland.  George simply overthought this movie, fell too much in love with special affects and disregarded making likeable characters that people could relate to.  Casting Jake Lloyd as young Darth...what more needs to be said about this performance...it sucked.  Worse you can't blame Lloyd, I mean he's a kid and if Cameron can pull Edward out of an arcade and make him credible in Terminator 2 than its something you might have to put on Lucas.  Simply the kid had too many lines, unrealistic delivery and simply no kids acts or talks like that and if they did, nobody would be able to stand him.  No wonder he was sold to slavery.  He's not the only one who delivers a stag performance, Neilson as Quigon simply is uninteresting and uncomfortable in this role.  Unlike the calmness and suave manner by which Guiness protrayed Obiwan and even McGregor does, Neilson simply doesn't have the knack for this kind of filmwork and he looks out of place.  These main characters like the previous...well not really...but sort of trilogy...are the ancors that hold the movie together.  It doesn't and the movie just shuffles from one uneventful scene to the other.  Dialogue being the killer.  George lacking a Han throws us a bone with Jar Jar...I wish I could throw it back.  Jar Jar is the worst idea of Lucas' career...worse that Howard the Duck and worse than cutting a shoe string budget for the special affects in Ewoks the Battle for Endor.  He simply is annoying and kids are too cynical now to enjoy his 50's style 3 Stooges humor.  He practically murders this franchise and there is no wonder he disappears from the remainder of the series save some bit parts.  Overall this movie lacks a simple story people can like, characters people give a crap about and fufillingness that people came to expect from George flicks.  Its a must own to complete the set, if only George would have let a movie director handle this and not himself...a special affects director.",1275523200,3,3346,4.608108108108108

But they just don't measure up. I'm sure for some fans of Star Wars this movie is rich in plot twists, special effects and very enjoyable. But for me they aren't even in the same league as the original Star Wars movies. For me, a great movie starts with characters you love (or hate) and they are placed on a 2 hour ride the draws you into their world and gives you a vested interest in the characters. This movie doesn't do that for me and although I have seen parts of episodes 1-3 on TV and watched for a little while, I never find enough interest and flip the channel.

I'm sure many people will enjoy Star Wars Episode I, the Phantom Menace. But it just makes me want to watch the original Star Wars and the movie magic that was captured in 6 hours of ground breaking film.

654993,2,6303454038,"This movie is made for children.  More specifically, it is made to entertain children while simultaneously selling them toys.

If you can turn off your brain and are able to find fart jokes and pointless action entertaining, then you may like this drivel.  If, however, you want strong characters with depth and believability, you won't find it here.  Take Anakin's mother as an example.  She lets two male strangers that she has literally just met enter her 8 year old in a deadly competition, then she lets these strangers take the boy away without so much as a choked back tear...yet she is supposed to be a great mother?  It is horrible writing in terms of characterization, just terrible.  Also, you'll probably not want to look to closely at the plot or you might miss it for all the holes.  Another example, you'd think that having a queen along who apparently owes her escorts her life would make raising funds to purchase Anakin's Mother's freedom by said escorts easy peasy.  Nope.  Instead of asking the Queen for a loan, they separate an 8 year old from his mother.  I'm guessing that at Jedi U, they didn't have child development classes.

Anyway, if this is what Star Wars is all about, I'm not going to watch the other five movies.  And whenever I learn that somebody I know is a big Star Wars fan, I'm going to assume they also love pro wrestling, farmville, and find farts utterly hilarious.

654995,4,6303454038,"George Lucas was rusty for the first installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. From 1984 to 1998, there were no Star Wars movies. Was it because George was waiting for technology to catch up, so he could make the type of movie that he envisioned in the early 70's? Whatever the case, Episode I has many frustrating moments, and some cool and relevant sequences that tell the story well. First, the bad: Starting with the script.....this movie isn't one that the average person is going to memorize, because it isn't simplistic like episodes 4, 5, and 6. Did George deliberately make the script a sophisticated one, to go with the high tech environment? With so much sophistication in the environment, as well as all of the high-tech gadgets, etc., could one really say, ""Can someone get this big walking carpet out of my way?"" Sure, life was simpler and more tangible a few decades ago, and movies were a reflection of it. The problem with The Phantom Menace is that there's too much emphasis on certain scenes, such as the pod races, and droid battles. A large chunk of the movie is spent highlighting Anakin's talents, but nothing in the form of depicting any hint of forthcoming evil that would contribute to his downfall in the next two films. I found myself getting bored during the pod race sequence, because too much time was spent on the special effects. Furthermore, was the pod race sequence even necessary? In my opinion, this sequence has absolutely no relevance to anything in subsequent movies. Why are Anakin's pilot skills so important to depict? He barely uses them in subsequent movies, and when he does, it is devoid of anything memorable or interesting. I believe in telling a part of a story in a much shorter format, and not dwell on it, such as the Jabba the Hutt sequence in Return of the Jedi. The Phantom Menace doesn't move along as efficiently as episodes 4-6, and boredom is the result. Boredom also stems from not initially following the sophisticated (and somewhat complicated) script. Like I mentioned, it isn't as tangible as one would want when it comes to the Star Wars franchise, which I think is a reflection of the times, as well as George's vision. It's very interesting that this movie (despite its complexities) is more or less a kid's movie. Now, the good: I certainly like the much higher level of skill that the jedi knights and sith lords display in lightsaber duels. Darth Maul is spectacular, and it is the duel with Qui-Gon that actually saves this movie from plunging into the abyss. I can't help but laugh when seeing the lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader in Episode 4--It was absolutely PATHETIC in terms of skill level. I know that Darth and Obi-Wan are older then, but their skill level is very inferior to what we see in 1,2,3,5, and 6. But George gets away with these things, and the loyal fans don't mind. I like the fact that he built the jedis and siths into skilled warriors, but it represents one of several things that don't transition well in subsequent films. Again, we give George a free pass. It's too bad that Yoda is a puppet in this one, and looks so different from the Yoda in the rest of the movies. This movie lacks attitude, for the most part, but it's understandable in a way, because it features a child, and the story has to be built around that. The musical score is fantastic as usual, as John Williams turns out another masterpiece that's a lot different from the the first 3 movies. I particularly like the music during the lightsaber battles.  The Phantom Menace is a movie that I've come to appreciate a little more in the past few years, after the next two movies were completed. I expect its popularity to grow a little in the coming years. Despite several areas of frustration, I still give this movie 4 stars, because of the cool environments and Darth Maul, who by the way should've been kept around for one more film. Oh well.  7.75/10",1267920000,3,3940,4.635193133047211
654996,3,6303454038,"Star Wars Episode 1.  The biggest box office smash since the 1989 Batman.  Widely considered to be the biggest disappointment in the history of cinema.  In 1999, George Lucas finally released the first of a prequel trilogy, which had been in development for sixteen years, since the release of Return of the Jedi in 1983. Lucas had sixteen years to write this thing.  And this was the best he could do?  I still don't hate this movie, but couldn't it have been a lot better?  But as I said, I don't think this is anywhere near as bad as the second and third episode.

The movie starts off with the following information. The Galactic Republic is in a period of decline, with its economy corrupt and deteriorating. In response to a taxation on trade routes, the Trade Federation organizes a blockade of battleships around the peaceful planet of Naboo.  No one gets in, and no one gets out.  Hoping to resolve the matter, the Supreme Chancellor has sent two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi, to negotiate with Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray.  So, what is the Trade Federation doing?  They're unhappy with some taxes, so now they decided to become terrorists?  It is revealed later that they're working with Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord, whatever that is.  But still, they decide to become full-blown terrorists just because they're frustrated with some taxes?  And if they're terrorists, why didn't the Chancellor send an army to take out the battleships?  And why is a Jedi-in-training suddenly called a Padawan?  In the old movies, Yoda never called Luke that, and neither did Obi-Wan.  Anyway, Darth Sidious orders the Viceroy to kill the Jedi.  Even though he has to know how hard it is to kill Jedi.  Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon escape, and discover that the Federation is planning to invade Naboo.  They head down to the planet to warn the people.  It is there that they meet Jar Jar Binks, the most despised character in the franchise.  The thing is, he didn't really bother me that much.  He's supposed to be the comic relief, which he actually is, occasionally.  I understand the point of view of people who hate him, but I didn't really feel that way about him.  I didn't love him, but I didn't hate him.

So then the Jedi go to the Naboo capital city and find that the invasion has already taken place.  The planet has been taken over.  The Trade Federation wants the Queen to sign a treaty so their invasion will be made legal.  The Jedi rescue the Queen (why is there a Queen in a Democratic system of government?) and escape the planet.  They want to head for Coruscant, but they are too low on fuel.  They have to stop at the nearby planet of Tatooine, a planet that is not a part of the Federation.  They meet a young Anakin Skywalker here.  Here's another thing I have a problem with.  At the end of Return of the Jedi, when Darth Vader is unmasked, he looks to be about at least sixty years old.  And since they decided to set this movie tirty years before ""A New Hope"", he would be at least in his late twenties at this point.  Anakin is a young nine-year-old slave kid.  When Qui-Gon hears that, he isn't shocked that there is still slavery in the Galaaxy.  He doesn't call Coruscant and have them send over a huge relief effort to free the slaves.  See, Jedi only help when there are trade or border disputes.  Not with stuff that actually matters, like this.  Qui-Gon can't get the parts for the ship that they need.  He doesn't have the correct money he needs on this world, so they are stuck for the time being.  Anakin then offers a solution.  He does Podracing, a sport than humans are not usually able to do.  He can enter the race, win, and give them the winnings.  They make a convoluted deal with Anakin's owner, Watto.  Qui-Gon has deduced that Anakin has Jedi reflexes.  He also makes a side bet with Watto.  If Anakin wins, the race, he is free.

Now, I have to say, even though this race was just a CGI version of the chariot race from Ben-Hur, I thought it was very good.  I don't know why so may people hate it so much.  After the race, Anakin is free.  They now have money for the parts they need.  Anakin has to leave his mother, and tells her that he will come back and free her one day.  As Anakin and Qui-Gon are about to leave, they are attacked by Darth Maul, who is a Sith, whatever that is.  After a short fight, they manage to escape unharmed.  Qui-Gon deduces that the Sith have returned.  When he returns to Coruscant, he reports this to the Jedi Coucil.  He also tells them about Anakin, and how he has a lot of iron in his blood, or something like that.  He thinks that Anakin is the chosen one, the one who was prophesied to bring balance to the force.  The same prophecy which , in the old movies, was never mentioned by Obi-Wan, Darth Vader, Yoda, or the Emperor.  Qui-Gon requests that the council agree to Anakin's training, but they refuse, claiming that he is too old.  Even though Luke Skywalker is later trained at about age twenty.  Meanwhile, the Queen cannot get the senate to act quickly enough.  Acting on advice from Palpatine, the Naboo senator, Amidala calls out the Chancellor as a weak leader who needs to be replaced.  In the meantime, she decides to go back to Naboo to try to help her people herself.  The Jedi council sends Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan with her to assist her and to try to meet Darth Maul again.  Instead, of, say, sending a few hundred Jedi Kights to assist the Queen.

The last half hour was the highlight for me.  They weren't really up to coherent storytelling in this movie, but they could at least do decent action scenes.  Padme, a handmaiden who befriended Anakin but is really the Queen in disguise, but who cares since she wasn't really developed a whole lot, devises an elaborate plan to capture the Viceroy.  When did she become such a great military strategist?  I thought Naboo was a peaceful planet.  Anyway, the ending battle was visually stunning.  It would have been a lot better if there had been an interesting story leading up to it.  Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon battle Darth Maul.  Qui-Gon is killed, but Obi-Wan is able to defeat Maul.  Before dying, Qui-Gon makes Obi-Wan promise that he will train Anakin.  This completely disarms what Obi-Wan told Luke in the old movies.  In Return of the Jedi, Obi-Wan told Luke that he wanted to train Anakin because he saw a potentially great Jedi Knight.  Not because Anakin was some chosen one or something.  And not because his old master asked him to do it.  Making this Obi-Wan's primary motivation for training Anakin makes his relationship with Anakin less meaningful, and doesn't establish the father/son-like relationship that they were supposed to have.  What they should have done is have Obi-Wan be the one arguing with the council that Anakin should be trained.  So Naboo is liberated, Obi-Wan becomes Anakin's master, Palpatine becomes Chancellor, and the movie ends.

This is no where near the worst thing to carry the name Star Wars.  It's certainly not the best, but it did have a few things going for it that puts it above the other two in this trilogy.  First of all, Qui-Gon is awesome.  Liam Neeson plays the fatherly mentor very well, and it was a shame that he could only be in one movie.  He could have possibly played Obi-Wan, even though Ewan Mcgreggor did a phenomenal job in that role.  Ewan wasn't too great in this movie, though.  He just seemed kind of wooden.  But maybe he was just playing the role he was given.  Another positive thing about this movie was the utter lack of Hayden Christensen.  Granted, Jake Lloyd wasn't a good actor either, but I have more sympathy for him.  He's just a kid, wheras Christensen is a grown man.  And Lloyd didn't whine nearly as much as Christensen.  Another thing I liked about the movie was Darth Maul.  Some people complain that he wasn't developed enough.  The thing is, that's what made him so interesting.  He's scary and mysterious.  Unfortunately, we never really learn what a Sith is.  I guess it's just a Jedi who turned to the dark side, but why didn't they call them that in the old trilogy?  For this prequel trilogy, they made up a bunch of names for thing that had different names in the old trilogy.  The Phantom Menace suffers from a lack of coherent plotlines, and the fact that it disarms what was supposed to happen based on the classic series.  However, there is some great CGI work done here.  I like to pretend that this prequel trilogy never was made, but this is the one movie from that trilogy that I can actually stand.",1266537600,7,8563,4.527450980392157
654997,5,6303454038,"I am a huge fan of star wars. My top movies are the movies one through six. Mr. Lucas could have not done better in making all these great movies, such as ""Indiana Jones"" and ""American Graffiti"" and most importantly ""Star Wars"" Right now, I am kind of upset about Lucas leaving his movies with Dave Filloni. I personally think Filloni is ruining everything Lucas set out to do.

But enough about that. MOVIE TIME!!! Although this movie is far from the six (A new hope my favoite and The fantom mennace is 3rd) but still even though it seems it belongs with two and three, I like to think of it as a median bettween the first three and the last two. In graphics for example; they are far beyond four five and six. But inferrior to two and three. Also how they made the movie is a similar situation.

The plot is hard to follow, which is a good thing, if you did not see the last two this one sets up Darth Vaders past but it sets you wondering and craving for the next movie. In fact in my oppinon it is the hardest untill two came around. I was four years old when this magnificent movie came out, but I did not understand the whole plot once I was twelve. But don't worry, if you think about it after the movie is over, there is allot more going on than it appears.

The trade Federation is blockaded by the greedy nemodians and the Suppreme chanselor of the glactic republic sends two Jedi's (obi-wan kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn) to investigate the matter and hopefully come to a diplomatic end. That is as far as I go. But there is much more to come. Lucas did a phenominal job.

As for the disc itself, it comes with a bonus disc with at least three hours of bonus material. Both discs came in without a scratch. There is an easter egg as well. When you hit ""play movie"" the twentieth century fox logo comes right away. There, hit the skip button (not fast forward) twice in a row. Then it has blopers of the movie. This trick works as well for the other two newer movies.

655100,2,6303454038,"As the first of the three prequels, and therefore the most distant from the original story, 'The Phantom Menace' was probably always doomed to be the least interesting. I was prepared to accept this film would be mostly background and story development, and that I wouldn't fully appreciate it until I'd seen Episodes II and III. All fair enough.

But Lucas made the problem worse by starting too far back, to the point where the movie feels almost disconnected from the Star Wars story. The trade dispute at the centre of the plot is supposed to highlight the beginning of the Republic's downfall, but is too mundane and obscure to be engaging. And it's impossible to make any connection between the boy Anakin and the greatest villain ever seen. It might have worked had Anakin been an interesting character, but he's basically a whiny brat (something which does not change at all throughout Episodes II and III). He's just plain annoying and adds nothing to the story.

Anakin apart, the acting and characterisation is a mixed bag. The two male leads do okay, although it's hard to accept Obi-Wan as a cocky young apprentice. Natalie Portman, unlike Episodes II and III, is at least given something to work with, while Ian McDiarmid was the obvious choice to play the younger Palpatine. However, Darth Maul, who had the potential to be a really cool and interesting villain, is largely sidelined......and do I really need to mention the laugh-at-him-not-with-him Jar Jar?

There's also a very leaden feeling to the production, a problem which plagues all three prequels. The spontaneous fun of the originals is missing, and the acting and dialogue is often predictable and wooden. Despite it's child-friendly gloss, too much of `The Phantom Menace' is taken up with the boring political posturing, which seems to suck all the fun and enjoyment out of the movie.

The only thing I really liked about this movie was watching Palpatine skilfully manipulate the trade crisis as his first step to becoming Emperor. That's probably the one and only key element in this movie for fans of the original. As for the rest, you could easily begin at Episode II and not miss very much.  There's no real reason the prequels couldn't have started as Episode II did, with Anakin already a young Jedi, which makes `The Phantom Menace' a bit of a waste of time, and a missed opportunity.",1263945600,2,2372,4.846913580246913

Admittedly, I was a child of the first Star Wars Generation and spoiled by the uniform brilliance of what has since become known as the Original Trilogy.  Even when I watch these frustratingly altered movies as an adult, I am reminded in spades that it wasn't simply the uncritical eye of a child that led me to adore them.  They were and are genuinely groundbreaking science fiction films deservedly remembered as some of the best ever made.  I say all of this to illustrate the unavoidable fact that ""Star Wars Episode I-The Phantom Menace"" does not even approach its tremendous predecessors(or sequels, depending on how one prefers to look at it).

It's not that it doesn't try.  George Lucas has cast some of the finest actors and most interesting character actors working today.  Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Ray Park and Pernilla August all appear in this movie.  Unfortunately, though, they all give uncharacteristically lackluster performances and seem lost amid an oversized world of stars, planets and spaceships.  This is also the first ""Star Wars"" movie which feels like it drags its two and a half hour runtime very slowly.

There were two huge faults in this movie, and they are both character-related.  The first is Jar Jar Binks, an upright alien rabbit with floppy ears which gets very old very quickly.  The second is the execution of the boy Anakin Skywalker.  Jake Lloyd is a terrible choice to play the pre-Darth Vader, but I think a bigger miscalculation is in not giving the character a hint of darkness to foreshadow the future.

This may seem extreme, but I was very mildly depressed the first time I saw this movie.  A piece of my childhood innocence was gone, and I saw more and more of the faults of ""Star Wars.""  Nevertheless, while time has cooled that initial reaction, I can still only give this film a mild endorsement.",1263686400,2,1885,4.825545171339564

But don't trust me. The greatest movie review ever made, is about this movie. I'm not joking. It is seriously the greatest movie review ever.  It is 70 minutes long and can be found in installments on Youtube. Just search for:

""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace Review (Part 1 of 7)"", by RedLetterMedia.

It will explain in painstaking, intelligent, and hilarious detail why this movie is junk.

By the way, there are other very good reviews on Youtube that also intelligently dissect this lame movie. Search them out and view all of them. You will have a much more enjoyable time watching the critical reviews of this movie than the movie itself.",1261180800,4,1090,4.626943005181347
655107,3,6303454038,"George Lucas' STAR WARS prequels have received a lot of flack (some from me!) for being too much focused on CGI and not enough on dialogue and strong characters. And based on the overall quality of the prequels, the complaints are warranted! But, that said, I think that this one, THE PHANTOM MENACE, is the best of the prequels. Unlike its successors ATTACK OF THE CLONES and REVENGE OF THE SITH, this first of the new trilogy is not nearly as bogged down in political details and sappy romance and doesn't come to a screeching halt at times like the other two. THE PHANTOM MENACE is kind of a new introduction to the STAR WARS universe, as it is, technically, EPISODE I. So timeline wise, it all begins here.

MENACE benefits from having a lot of energy and being fast-paced. It compels the viewer to accept this world and doesn't waste time as much as the successor films of the trilogy. The film's protagonists are Qui-Gon Jin (truly fine performance by Liam Neeson) and his young apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (solid Ewan McGregor). Additionally, the solid cast includes Jake Lloyd (as young Anakin Skywalker), Natalie Portman (as teen Queen Amidala of Naboo), Samuel L. Jackson (as Jedi Master Mace Windu), Ian McDarmid (as Senator Palpatine, Naboo's representative in the Senate), Terence Stamp (as Chancellor Valorem, appointed leader of the Republic), Pernilla August (as Anakin's mother Schmi Skywalker) and Ray Park (as Darth Maul, apprentice to behind-the-scenes Darth Sidious). Also, we get to see ""young"" Yoda! In this film, as in the originals, Yoda is a puppet, whereas in the other prequels, he is CGI. If the actors seem a tad monontonous at times,  I blame this mostly on the weak script and George Lucas' direction, or lack thereof. Lucas focused more on effects and plot here than he did in his actor's performances, so I'm not going to blame them for having the misfortune of working from shortsighted direction and script. Mostly everything else works.

In addition to Yoda, there are some good 'creature' characters like Anakin and Schmi's slavemaser Watto, Anakin's rival young Greedo (from the original STAR WARS) and Sebulba (a pod-racing star). Also, legendary robots C3PO and R2D2 return for the proceedings (good thing robots can live forever!).

The biggest draws to this film are several exciting and well done action scenes, including the fantastic CGI pod race in the middle of the film and the climactic lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan and Darth Maul. Also, the musical score that accompanies this film is really top notch and accentuates the action sequences. Not even close to the magic of the films of the original trilogy, but a much better movie-watching experience than the 2 flicks that followed!

This 2-disc set is great with a commentary and extra disc that explains how a lot of the CGI was handled and of course deleted scenes.",1259798400,,2878,4.93801652892562

655242,2,6303454038,"Although I enjoyed the look of ""The Phantom Menace,"" and found many of the characters intriguing, the overall impact fell just short of 3 stars or my idea of the positive zone.  There simply isn't enough depth to the story or characters to enable me to suspend my belief in the face of the unconvincing and slightly ridiculous Star Wars mythology.  Maybe the point is not to pay attention to this stuff at all but I can't be satisfied by great action scenes and some nifty sci-fi settings alone.",1256342400,,495,4.550561797752809
655243,4,6303454038,"Yes, my main gripe, like many fans of the franchise, is Jake Lloyd. But to surprise a few people, I have no problems with Jar Jar Binks. He doesn't bother me in any way when I watch it. Do I think he was a little over the top? Yes. Do I think he, along with the Neimoidians, are racial stereotypes of Jamaicans and Asians respectively? No. The story is good but it can plod along at a very sluggish pace. For instance, once the story gets to Tatooine, they could've trimmed a few scenes, the Podrace imparticular. And some scenes on Coruscant feel slow as well, like the pointless scenes of watching Palpatine take the Queen to her apartment suite. Its brief but un-necessary. Liam Neeson does an admirable job as Qui-Gon, portraying him as a caring yet very formidable warrior. Ewan McGregor portrays Obi-Wan as a young, headstrong Jedi. The character at least goes through development over the course of the prequel trilogy and he'll eventually become the character from the ""first"" (fourth) film. Natalie Portman is alright as Queen Amidala but she's no Princess Leia. Though her hairdos can outdo Leia's and both are good with a blaster, the way the character's acted out comes across as wooden and stiff. And when Portman actually is the Queen, where does that deep, accented way of speaking come from? Is that Keira Knightley dubbing her voice when she's in the Queen's clothes? I don't know. And then there's Jake Lloyd, who's able to take the concept of what Anakin is to become in the future and make the character less intimidating. To know that in Vader's youth, he was prone to shout ""Yipee!"" and be called ""Ani"". That's not very threatening! Though I will give him credit for at least trying, its just that they did not capture the best (if there is any) performances of the actor and I'm pretty sure Lucas and the producers could've done A LOT better. There are some familiar faces from the original movies; Kenny Baker as R2-D2 (not much has changed over the course of six films) and his first meeting with a pre-gold plated C-3PO (still played by Anthony Daniels) and Ian McDiarmid as Senator (later Supreme Chancellor) Palpatine and his sinister alter ego, Darth Sidious. Darth Maul is a formidable villain for the film, though there always seems to be a co-villain in the newer films instead of just one singular villain, but I guess for all six you can count the Emperor as an over-arching villain, but I digress. And there are cameos by a young Jabba the Hutt, some Wookies in the Senate scene and General Zod himself, Terence Stamp as Supreme Chancellor Vallorum. The fight scenes are some the best, the four different fights at the climax being the standout. And its time for to once again praise John Williams. The man can do no wrong it seems as the music is just fantastic. My favorite set pieces being Duel of the Fates and the space fight. And The Imperial March is incorporated into Anakin's theme, forshadowing the fate the character will meet.",1256083200,3,2973,4.664761904761905
655244,5,6303454038,"I have seen all the Star Wars films with the exception of Episode III, and they are some of the best movies perhaps of all time. This one, the first in the series of newer movies following the life of Anakin Skywalker, is probably the best, if there is one that is better than all the others. I've always thought that the newer movies had sub-par acting in comparison to the original three, but Episode I has an exceptional performance by Liam Neeson. The special effects are absolutely stunning. The best scenes in the movie, in my opinion, are the podrace scene and the Qui-Gon Jinn/Obi-Wan Kenobi vs. Darth Maul lightsaber battle. The effects in the podrace scenes are good in the fact that they accurarley portray the speed of the podracers and there are several crashes that are quite graphic. The lightsaber battle is longer than in the other movies and is, I believe the best lightsaber scene in any of the movies (I don't know about Episode III, but from what I've heard, there are some good lightsaber scenes in that one too). If you are new to Star Wars, I would start with this episode, not Episode IV, because you can see them in the correct order. I would also watch this one first because it's a good intro into the series. I highly recommend this!!",1254873600,5,1263,4.5196506550218345
655245,1,6303454038,"This could have been one of the better Star Wars movies. It certainly had excellent special effects and a superb duel between two Jedi and the Sith. However, it was marred by two characters. Jar Jar Binks turned out to be one of the most annoying characters ever conceived, whose every utterance was like hearing fingernails raked across a blackboard (one prominent critic wrote in anticipation of the next Star Wars movie, ""Jar Jar Binks must die!"" Unfortunately, he did not). The other was the child Anakin. I think, however, that this was primarily due to the dialogue given him; there were many instances where he just should have been silent and Lucas had him talking his head off with inane comments, but in truth his inflection left a lot to be desired during the exciting parts).",1253923200,2,787,4.751824817518248

So like most I was excited to hear that, finally, Lucas was going back and bringing us more Star Wars.  It was too good to be true!  Here I am at 30 years old and Episode 1 is coming out!

I think that with most fans here in lies the problem...

Now we are older.  None of the original fans are kids anymore.  And I firmly believe this is why all the negative crap about Episode 1.

No, it's not the same.  It CAN'T be.  We're not children...we have had twenty years of sophisticated sci-fi movies under our belts.  What dazzeled us as kids simply won't work anymore.

Don't believe me?  Ask any kid who saw Episode 1 when they were 8 to maybe 13 years old.  The majority LOVED it.  Why?  The same reasons we loved the original back in 1977.  The didn't have the baggage of 'Lucas changed our favorite film series'.  All we had as kids were things like the Star Trek and Lost In Space TV series and films like 2001 and Planet Of The Apes.  Star Wars WAS new and different...and very special.  As adults, it just isn't anymore, considering how much SPFX have progressed (and, of course we do have the original trilogy to thank for most of those leaps and bounds).

Next time you see Episode 1...try to watch it with a kid.  Maybe you might just see it reflected back at you the way our parents saw it in our eyes back in 1977.",1248566400,5,1537,4.132203389830509

When the audience for the premiere emptied out, everyone had blank, bewildered faces. Not good. After watching it I understood why. STTMP put the best characters on the sidelines and rehashed ""Where No Man Has Gone Before.""

Fans develop attachments to characters and themes.

Even the late great Joseph Campbell revered the original STAR WARS trilogy. The original will always remain a classic, and Empire, the immediate sequel, nearly topped it. But by the time we got to Jedi we had cutesy Ewoks running around and a rehash of blow-up-death-star.

Drunk on profits, Lucas was already dumbing down the franchise.

Little did we know just how dumb it would get until PHANTOM MENACE.

We've all seen and suffered through it anyway, so I'm preaching to choirs. But it's still staggering to witness just how childish, simplistic and foolish PHANTOM is - this from a man who could literally film anything he wanted - and he did.

Nobody wanted to say NO to George Lucas.

Jar-Jar Binks: easily the most reviled ""character"" in film history; that took a lot of work to accomplish.

Darth Vader - a cultural icon - is reduced to a silly child. ""Annie! Annie!""

ANNIE??? That's a girl's name, and a rather famous one.

There are so many jaw-droppingly stupid scenes, from the underwater ""fish"" people prancing around to the idiotic ""finale"" with Annie running amok as a wannabe pilot.

The menacing presence of Darth Maul is the only saving grace here, and the lightsaber duel is pretty impressive in it's own right. But the rest of the films flaws are just to much to suffer through.

He did like it and I suppose he's the target audience, but there's no excuse for any movie, even a kid's movie, being this lame. I somehow managed to mostly notice Natalie Portman. She's really pretty but what's with Lucas and the hairdos? Remember Carrie Fisher's cinnamon buns in the first movie? Portman has many styles that are more like outlandishly elaborate pastries than hair. And honest to God, I did a better acting job in my 4th grade production of Sleeping Beauty in 1972, wearing my mother's nightgown as a fairy costume, than Portman does in The Phantom Menace. Like, what meds was she on? I'm happy for Ewan MacGregor and Liam Neeson that they got nice paychecks out of this as they have given many fine performances in lower-profile films, but the material here is so bad that even actors of their talents can do little.

Finally after being utterly bored at home and this on at a convenient time, I decided to just watch it, just to watch it. Well, I am actually surprised I sat through the whole thing. Attack of the Clones was pretty darn cheesy, from beginning to end, but Phantom Menace no doubt takes the cake in that department.

I actually thought watching Liam Neeson and Ewan Mcgregor on screen together would be far more interesting than it was. Well, Mcgregor was underutilized and Neeson was a bore. The awful dialogue didn't help matters. Neither did the special effects. I nearly fell of the couch upon seeing Yoda in this.

I just don't get it. You get these brilliant actors-outside of the Star Wars arena-and they're great. You put them in front of a green screen and they're so unbearably wooden it's weird. And this didn't even have the excuse of Hayden Christensen.  But Natalie Portman was just odd and stoney in this one, as in the rest of the trilogy. Of course normally, she's a pretty good actress. Same goes for just about every actor in this. And I'm not even going to get started with that Jar Jar character.

The editing was all over the place-just way too jumpy. Music was pretty cool-at least that stayed consistant. The costumes were just beautiful, no question there. Everything else-a mess. It just all came off a bit childish. Darth Maul would have been a really cool character-if he were in the film for more than five minutes.

I thought Attack of the Clones was the worst Star Wars film, but after finally watching The Phantom Menace, there is no doubt in my mind that the positions have changed.",1234742400,2,1854,4.5359281437125745

655346,2,6303454038,"Get ready to be swept away by the next installment of one of the most loved and watched sci-fi movies of all time... Star Wars Episode One. It sounds more exciting than the actual experience of watching this slow, drab, feckless piece of work. I'm a huge Star Wars (episode 4-6) fan like many others but this new installment was bad Han Solo not firing first bad.

Story (lacked originality): The story is fundamentally sound there is good vs. bad and the battles for who will prevail. Jedi knights get entangled in rescuing themselves along with a queen from an evil corrupt federation. There are amusing fights with the Federation standard robot army. They bounce around the galaxy and end up finding a very young boy on a remote planet we've already been to TWO times before. The boy displays natural ability in regards to the force but lacks any acting talent. A cool evil sith lord is introduced but given an anorexic amount of lines. Viewers will visit the galactic capital Coursant but this is less entertaining then a Disneyland commercial. These stories are meant to sweep us away and take us to new worlds where we're simply awed and amazed. I ended up being awed by how bad the acting and script were and amazed my beloved series has been reduced to dribble.

Acting (mostly below average): Do I start with the bad news or the good news. Well I don't really have a whole lot of good news except several gifted actors/actresses starred in this movie (Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, Liam Neelson plus the original C-3PO actor). The problem was none of there performances were above par when compared to there previous works. In fact this movie didn't bring out there talent but seemed to siphon it. Then there are the already bad actors. There performances are out right criminal. We're stuck watching the main character a young boy who for one is a bad actor and for two is put in ridicules situations that again took away from this movie. I can't even start with Jar Jar yet it hurts too much to speak his name.

Script (god awful): George Lucas must have been on the can when he wrote this script. The lines are chalky and lack originality. You're stuck time after time hearing a regurgitated lines stolen from the original movies. The script feels like jigsaw puzzles that doesn't have any of the right pieces. There isn't smooth transition from one part of the movie to the next. It all feels either rushed or awkward. The movie also becomes very complex but in a 20 car pile up sort of way. Your shown glimpses of the galactic senate and taken into the honored Jedi Counsel Halls but no one seems to have motives that make sense. The Federation is being very naughty to the planet of Naboo but why doesn't the galactic republic army crush them? Is there a galactic republic army? If not then how do they maintain power since no strong government ever does without a military. Why doesn't the Federation simply attack Crousant and go for the gold if they don't have a military? You literally see about ten Galactic soldiers I mean this is the capital for the whole universe and there is only ten soldiers come on give me a break. Unfortunately not even Yodas few witty lines could save us from this mostly stale experience. Yoda mostly reminded me that this movie isn't about creating a new cutting edge craft but about attempting to relive the past.

Music (Fair): The music as a whole is only fair. I'm not blaming John Williams the man had nothing to work with. That being said the music is one of the better parts to this movie. The end Sith battle music is powerful with a strong chorus added to the orchestra. The effect was moving but little to late in this already flat experience.

 Most the fight scenes are cool but others are ruined by Jar Jar and Anakin. The end Sith lord light saber battle actual had some emotion. The only problem was the Sith lord was the most interesting character and he was never given a chance to shine due to him not given hardly any lines or back story. He does however wield a sweet double bladed light saber. All this being said a lot of younger viewers love this new installment and fail to see the plethora of flaws that ensue.

He did not expect it to do that well. He was exhausted from working on it, and vowed never to direct again, which is why he did not direct ep 5 and ep 6.

Everytime I watch it the movie seems to get better because I pick up little things that add to the overall Star Wars Universe. That being said, the main reason I give it only four stars is because after watching the deleted scenes I see what the movie could have been had some of those scenes been left in. If anyone has read the novelization they know how important certain scenes were that were left out of the theatrical release of Episode I. Perhaps George Lucas will release Special Editions of the first three films in the series (Episodes I-III) and include those additional scenes to expand the universe a bit more. If that happens I will definitely be giving the extended version of this film five stars. So this only gets four stars, but seeing and/or buying this DVD is a must if you are a science-fiction fan, and especially if you are even a casual Star Wars fan.

Obviously Special Effects are going to rule any Star Wars Movie. as they do in all 6. Darth Maul Everyone Says was so Cool they should have kept him around.  All I hear is He was ""too cool to Kill Off"" and I say "" He Really was Cool, But he Served his Purpose.  His Character  needed to Be killed off ....For the STORY"" and as George always says ""Story First"" Next.  Liam Neason as Qui-Gon GIn was Essential and The Overall Story was Pivotal AS a Beginning To (NOt Darth Vader) but Anakin's Origin's . WE See his Incredible ability to Love.(Which Will lead To his Ability to Hate). WE see His Intuition with the Force, the POdrace and the Space battle were all controlled by the force(and Darth Sidious) Nothing will happen to his prize.  The Movies make Sense the more you read into them.
  Why were they not as successful as the Original Trilogy?  People Come up with a Million and one Excuses.  The real reason is The Original Trilogy - Nobody EVER saw anything like that before.  A Million Movies came out since, each one outdoing the next, people got Spoiled.  Now Star Wars When the Bar was set so high- Nothing could have met the expectations people had. So when 3 Great movies came out each one better then the last, people who were already Spoiled weren't getting the Undeliverable Movie they wanted.  They were let down.""What it isn't better then Perfect?"" That is the Reason.",1218240000,3,2251,4.30166270783848
655487,5,6303454038,I love this movie because its a way to make sure you can connect all the dots about the movie. I love how all the Star Wars movies come together and still make sense from the first movies made.,1218067200,4,193,3.9743589743589745
655488,3,6303454038,"Here it is -- the most maligned and controversial movie of its time; the one to receive the most ridiculously overblown hype before its release, as well as the most severe backlash afterwards; the film supposedly responsible for millions of dashed hopes, ""raped childhoods"", and perhaps even a suicide or two, according to all the internet gossip.

  Personally, I never thought much of either the prerelease hype or the hysterical fanboy backlash -- whatever its faults, this movie is not worth getting so upset over.  There was simply no way ANY film could have lived up to the overblown expectations heaped upon this one. And those people whose lives were ""ruined"" or ""raped"" by this movie probably already had serious personal issues to begin with...

  Having said all that, the film does have its fair share of problems.  I did like it when I first saw it in the theater, and I was eagerly awaiting the next chapter when I walked out.  Looking back, I probably liked it more for what it COULD have been, rather than for what was actually up on the screen.  The Star Wars universe is always a fun place to visit, and I think -- contrary to all the conspiracy theories -- that George Lucas meant well, and really did what he thought was best for the series at that point.  There were some good IDEAS here that had potential, but Lucas unfortunately had trouble forging them into a compelling MOVIE.

  Perhaps the biggest problems stemmed from the different circumstances under which this movie was made, versus the original films.  When the first Star Wars came out, Lucas had no idea whether any sequels would even be made; the film had to stand on its own merits.  By contrast, Ep. I was made with the full knowledge that there would be two more films to follow; this could have unintentionally led Lucas to take more time developing his story and characters than he should have.  He evidently became more concerned with foreshadowing and setting up future stories than showing a compelling one in THIS film.  This resulted in a film that, unlike the originals, didn't stand too well on its own, and that depended too much on being a small part of the larger SW series for its appeal; indeed, a common complaint was that Ep. I was little more than a feature-length trailer for the rest of the prequel trilogy.

  Another problem seems to be the inverse of what plagues most movie trilogies -- many series starting out strong only to lose focus as they go on, as if their creators know how to begin their stories but not how to end them.  With the SW prequel trilogy, Lucas seems to have the opposite problem; he knew how he wanted it to END (Anakin becomes Darth Vader), but not how exactly to BEGIN it.  Thus this series became more focused as it progressed, but began as an unfocused mess, to this film's detriment.

  Add to this the script, which had the feel of a first draft that needed much more work before filming began.  While all the other SW films dealt with large conflicts spanning the galaxy, much of Ep. I focused on small, localized events that felt more like an abstract, throwaway plot merely to introduce the characters.  While I understand showing much of the developing conflicts growing out of seemingly mundane events that become larger and larger while spiralling out of control, Ep. I tended to dwell on trivial matters while rushing through others that should have been expanded upon.  There was too much talking and TELLING the audience about what happened, rather than SHOWING them. Take, for instance, the invasion of Naboo; we are TOLD the Naboo people were ""suffering and dying"", the death toll was ""catastrophic"", etc., but never SHOWN this -- no raging battles, no burning buildings or civilian casualties, etc.  Ditto for Anakin's life as a slave -- Lucas should have SHOWN us the brutality of slavery, with perhaps some deaths as a result, to make us FEEL Anakin's desire to leave for a better life.

  Unfortunately, it seems Lucas tried to compensate with juvenile kiddie humor.  I understand that the film was supposed to convey the feel of the Republic in more ""innocent"" times, before the rise of the evil Empire; however, much of the humor here seems to have been mere filler, to pad and stretch out the already thin plot.  Too often, Lucas went for ""campy"" or ""silly"", to the point where it practically defined the movie itself.  The most obvious was Jar Jar; while his character did serve an important purpose in the film, Lucas didn't bother to make him sympathetic in the least -- there was no reason to believe the Jedi would want anything to do with him, or take him across the galaxy when he hardly ""pulled his own weight"", and continuously caused problems.  This ""campy"" trend extended to other characters as well -- the rival racers in the podrace, for example, came across like cartoonish puppets, instead of menacing alien opponents like they should have. And the battle droids of the Trade Federation (the overt antagonists of the film) seemed not only weak but simply too silly-looking to make effective villains.  (The droidekas fared better in this regard; maybe a droid army composed of bipedal versions of these machines would have made a more convincing threat.)

  Nonetheless, Ep. I DID have some good points, with flashes of that old ""Star Wars magic"", as it were.  There were some good set pieces, like the stately palaces on Naboo and the mythic grandeur of Coruscant, especially the Jedi Temple and Galactic Senate chambers.  Early on, the approach to the underwater city of the Gungans managed to evoke a sense of wonder similar to the Emerald City in ""The Wizard of Oz""; the attacks of the giant underwater monsters were impressive, also.

  As for the heroes, Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn was one of the film's saving graces.  I found him to be the most likeable character in the movie, and I truly felt for him at the end.  Ewan McGregor did a decent job as Obi-Wan, though he had little to do.  Pernilla August was also convincing in her small role as Anakin's mother.  As for the much-maligned Jake Lloyd, I could take him or leave him, though he did have a couple of good moments.  The scenes where Anakin parted with his mother on Tatooine, and where he was sitting alone in the spaceship with Padme, talking about how cold and lonely he was, were rather well done, capturing the mood of young Anakin as he was thrust into his strange new life.

  As the villains, Darth Maul and Darth Sidious were an effectively menacing duo that drove most of the events of the movie through their actions.  The final battle between Maul and the Jedi Knights was a definite highlight.  Another for me was Darth Sidious, who provided a link to the old SW mythos as a grim foreshadowing of things to come.  Whenever the sinister figure of Sidious appeared on screen to deliver his orders for his evil plans via holographic transmission to the intimidated Trade Federation leaders, the sense of tension was palpable.

  After all is said and done, while I can't bring myself to truly dislike any SW film, and can appreciate the good points of this movie and what Lucas was trying to do here, it still could have been so much more.  It's not a terrible film, as some say -- just a muddled, mediocre one that feels like a lost opportunity.  With a more carefully constructed plot that stood better on its own, and which engaged the audience and made them care more about the outcome, it could have been far better.  As it is, Ep. I will probably be remembered as the ""red-headed stepchild"" of the Star Wars saga, being only for series completists who will fast forward to the good parts.  Fortunately, although this film started the prequel trilogy off on a sour note for many people, Lucas was able to learn from most of his mistakes, and the next two installments would be HUGE improvements over this one.",1217635200,4,7867,4.671511627906977
655489,4,6303454038,Pretty good.  Little boy Anakin is great.  Much less whiny than his older self.  My husband pretty much loves Qui-Gon Jinn and there's that crazy sith with the red and black face paint.,1214438400,2,185,4.545454545454546

655613,3,6303454038,"By now, everybody will have long made up their mind on whether or not ""The Phantom Menace"" sucked; while the film continues to boast a number of fans, there's little debate regarding the notion that George Lucas spectacularly under-delivered what could have been one of the biggest films in history. True, it made a mountain of money, but in no way other than a mirrored leap in technology does ""Episode I"" come close to touching the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy for being a movie to base an entire generation on.

Two Jedi knights - Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson, ""Schindler's List"") and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor, ""Moulin Rouge!"") - are sent to confront the leaders of the evil Trade Federation about their blockade and upcoming invasion of the peaceful planet of Naboo. Before being ambushed and fleeing to Naboo, the Jedi find out that the life of the planet's leader, Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman, ""V For Vendetta""), is in jeopardy; they manage to rescue the queen, but following a daring escape, they are forced to land on the desert planet Tatooine. Here, the Jedi encounter a gifted young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), whom Qui-Gon is sure is the answer to an ancient prophecy foretelling of the one who would bring balance to the Force and destroy the deadly Sith - an agent of which (Ray Park, ""X-Men"") is hot on their heels...

Rest assured, this is not a bad movie, but in trying to live up to the film-defining legacy of its three ""sequels"", ""Menace"" fails miserably.
Maybe it's the fault of the actors: Liam Neeson is really the only character who feels like he would fit into the Star Wars universe, while McGregor, Portman, Lloyd, and even Samuel Jackson (""Pulp Fiction"") as Mace Windu are remarkably bad in their performances; the phrase ""trying to act"" is accurate, here.
Or maybe it's the new world that Lucas created: vistas like Naboo, Coruscant, and Mos Espa - though visually beautiful - rely so much on CGI that they lack the subtle depth that Mos Eisley, Hoth, or Endor had. And like the performers, none of them feel at all familiar or particularly in-tune with the Star Wars landscape we used to know.
Or maybe it's the un-climatic introduction to the romance that would turn out Luke and Leia Skywalker, and bring about the creation of Darth Vader - I mean, a 9-year-old (Anakin) getting the hots for a 14-year-old (Amidala)? Ugh.

Or maybe it was just Jar-Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), who I loved, but everybody else on earth hated with a passion.
Yes, we'll just say it was him.

What the film does hold in its favour, however, are graphics that were mind-blowing then and still amazing now: the Gungan city, the sea monster scene, the pod racing, and the ground/space battle for Naboo are visually delightful, and continued Lucas' trademark of raising the bar when it came to utilizing technology to its fullest extent. Eyeballs, prepare to be amazed.
The action scenes are also a lifesaver: after the fairly limited duels of the previous trilogy, watching the fast-paced, acrobatic encounters between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul are a breath of fresh air for the series, and definitely don't hurt expectations. In addition, the pod race is just about the most exciting scene in the movie - blending incredible visuals, impressive soundwork, and a healthy amount of exhilaration for an attention-grabber that even the nay-sayers can't admit they saw coming.

To quote Roald Dahl, the film ""has the same glacial beauty as an iceberg, but unlike the iceberg [it] has absolutely nothing below the surface"": for all of its pretty things to look at, ""The Phantom Menace"" lacks the classic storytelling and archetypical characters that made its predecessors so successful with audiences. Even worse, the film lacks a feeling of kinship with the original trilogy: aside from a few names and characters, it feels too much like its own adventure, and hardly seems like the beginning of anything as grand as what the first three films were.
Rest assured, Star Wars fans should be quick to pick this one up, and even non-fans will be able to have a fun time with it...but seeing as my disappointment is still intact, even nine years after the film's release, it's impossible to call it great.",1213920000,3,4246,4.8429752066115705

655615,4,6303454038,"Is it really 9 years since The Phantom Menace brought Star Wars back to the Cinema after a 16 year hiatus? Back in the summer of 1999, the world was a very differant place to today. Bill Clinton was still American President. The Twin Towers were still standing and few people had heard of Al Qeada. As we counted down to a new Millennium the world appeared to be on the cusp of a new golden age of econmic prosperity and relative peace. Admist this background came Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. The hype and expectation for this movie was probably greater than anything before or since in movie history. What film could ever hope to live up to this hype and expectation? No film ever could. The initial response from fanboys and critics across the world was cries of anguish and pain. Claims of childhoods being raped drowned out the more sensible reflections that actually this movie whilst not particularly great, was as bad as many claimed it was. Now, almost a decade on from the initial release, perhaps the time is right for a more considered view of this film?

The Phantom Menace is the very definition of a ""mixed"" film. It has both good and bad points, and whether you end up liking this film will depend on;

1. Do the bad points outweigh the good points for you?
2. Do the good points outweigh the bad points for you?

Thus you will find the answer of whether or not this movie works for you, somewhere in the balance of the two.

Some of the bad points; George Lucas's direction is stiff. Lucas hadn't directed a film since 1977 and it shows.
Jar Jar Binks is annoying and tedious and frequently gets in the way, however, as with so many complaints about this film, Binks is NOT as bad as some would have you believe, and you CAN enjoy this film despite the presense of JJB. Children will love Jar Jar, so if you show this film to your 8 year old child, please don't let your loathing of Mr Bink's ruin your child's love for this character.
Other bad points are that the pod race goes on too long (it went on too long in the theatrical release, and for some reason its been extended further for the DVD)
Ewan Mcgregor unfortunatly gets very little to do.
Natalie Portman shines as Queen Amidala, but as Padme she often leaves a lot to be desired. Jake Lloyds Anakin is given some annoyingly silly lines to read out (as with Binks, Lloyd is NOT as bad as outraged fanboys would have you believe)
The Gungans are probably the worse species in SW history (except for the Ewoks of course ;) ) and the final battle between the Gungans and the Battle Droids is unengaging.
Perhaps my main complaint about Menace is that the two characters that get the most screen time, Jar Jar Binks and Qui-Gon Jinn, are the two characters that don't really feature in the next two films. Thus, this is, I think, the central problem with Menace. Its mainly filler. Lucas needed ""more"" in this film.

Some of the good points; Liam Neeson is the glue that holds this film together. Anybody that says the acting was better in the OT, should look at Neesons performance. Its at least as good as anything in the OT.
The political sub-plot is interesting and engaging and seeing how Palpatine begins his rise to power is compelling. Ian Mcdiarmid is outstanding in the small number of scenes he is given.
The Mother/Son relationship between Anakin and his Mother is well done and you do feel a sense of Anakins pain at being parted from his mother and having to leave her as a slave. The twist of Anakin's origins (that he was born without a father) adds a mystical and mythical element. Deeply religious people may be offended, but ""virgin births"" feature in many mythical stories.
Seeing the workings of the Jedi Council and how the Jedi relate to the Senate is interesting.
Darth Maul is cool and The Duel Of The Fates is probably the most exciting lightsaber battle of the Saga. The piece of music that accompany's the duel is truely outstanding (otherwise John Williams' score on TPM isn't very memorable - Like Lucas, at times you get the sense he is warming himself up with this picture
The general time and effort and attention to detail is wonderful. For Amidala's gowns alone costume designer Trisha Biggar should have won an Oscar. ILM's special effects are amazing. The film looks outstanding and sounds wonderful. As a piece of art, The Phantom Menace is an awesome blend of creativity and artisitic inspiration. Too bad the final product ended up so mixed.

Just to say, the movie ranks as a solid *** affair, but the DVD package itself takes it up to **** The central documentery; The Beginning is one of the best DVD extras you'll find on any DVD release. An absolute gem. It even captures the moment George Lucas himself realise's the movie is not panning out as well as he had hoped. Also included in the extras is a full commentery, deleated scenes, trailers, music video and web-docs (which are also of the highest quality)

In closing, The Phantom Menace IS a deeply flawed movie. Slow, plodding and yes, in places even dull. Much of it is filler and a setting up effort. But it also has moments of pure brilliance and many parts are good or very good. Theres a fascination at seeing the Star Wars universe; BEFORE THE DARK TIMES. This is a film that is about children and for children. Theres a lightness and feeling of innocence that contrasts fantastically to the much, much darker Episode III. Given the time in which the movie was released, itself a moment that could be described as ""before the darkness"" you can't help but feel a pang of nostalgia when you watch The Phantom Menace.

655617,3,6303454038,"Ok, so now the three part saga has become a six part extravaganza with the '99 release of `Star Wars - The Phantom Menace'. And just when I was about to forgive George Lucas for inventing those ridiculous Ewoks in `Return of the Jedi' he goes even further into the realm of the absurd with the creation of Jar-Jar Binks (You're not a Jedi George, you've already shown us you can't trust your instincts so think before you create).

The special effects definitely continue to improve with each new adventure and getting the Jedi more involved is a big plus. The sinister looking Sith Darth Maul is also a wonderful addition to the 'Star Wars' mythos. Though initially pleased to see the Order of the Jedi play a much larger role in the storyline, unfortunately the ""words of wisdom"" dispensed by the members of this Order of mystical warriors now comes across as shallow and pretentious, not profound as it had in the earlier films. Yes even with the return of a younger Yoda (since the new films chronologically pre-date the original trilogy) the lessons of the Jedi have lost their potency.

When all is said and done the big question that still puzzles me is why does Lucas continue to populate the screen with so many cartoon looking characters that ruin the Star Wars experience for any fan above the age of twelve? Evidently he's seeking an ever younger audience.

My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-.",1211760000,2,1395,4.662601626016261
655618,3,6303454038,"I saw this movies in theatres, and at the time I remmeber really enjoying the movie. The special effects were amazing, the lightsaber battles were awesome and Darth Maul was the badest Sith I had ever seen, so very different in his approach than Vader.

I recently bought this DVD, because I only had this movie on VHS and I no longer own a VHS Cassette player. I had all the other movies on DVD so I figured I would complete my set. I put it in and watched it again, and I found myself getting a bit bored. The storyline was only ""OK"" and in many cases the acting was seriously bad. Having a very young Anakin Skywalker was a poor choice I feel. The viewing audience would have happily accepted a 12-14 year old Anakin, and maybe, just maybe, they could have found an actor who didn't so precociously force his lines.

When watching the Original Trilogy, you know that the heroes of that series would most likely die if put into the situations they endure, but each character has a ""hero factor"" a kinf of charisma that lets you suspend disbelief enough to convice yourself that they could pull off the impossible saves that they do in the film.

You don't get that same feeling from the characters in this movie. Anakin should have died at least 8 times in situations that is rediculous to expect an 8 year old to handle. Also all the characters seem ""invincible"" until its time for them to die to promote a plot point. When Vader died it was like ""wow, you can feel the pain he has been through and he relief at redemtion"" when the Emperor died is was climactic. Qui Gon had an air of calm command about him, but when he died it didn't seem like a tragedy, it seemed more like ""Oh well, I guess its time I died."" You can only take the Jedi stoicism so far before it seems cheesy. Obi Wan was does not yet have the commanding presence he later will, but we can accept that because of his relative ""youth"" in the movie. The only character that gave the same kind of awe Yoda originally did, was Mace Windu, and he was only breifly in this movie.

And then we get to Jar Jar and Padme. Jar Jar was just incredibly annoying, and he served no purpose in the movie. In fact the movie would have been improved and would have flowed much better had the whole Gungan species not been present in it. ""Oh lets escape from these droids by going to an underwater cuty for 5 minutes."" and then ""Oh lets rescue the princess by traveling through the planet's water filled core (which doesn't makes sense according to 'Physics')."" I know the Gungans were only in the movie for Comic Relief, but unfortunately (and this is true for all incidental Aliens in the new trilogy) they just made the movie seem cartoonish. Whereas the aliens in the original trilogy seemed a bit sinister and unknown, I strongly feel that I have seen the aliens from the new trilogy before.. on Cartoon Network.

While I can watch the Original Trilogy and it still seems as fresh today as it did when I was a little kid, watching the new trilogy after a few years just reminds me of how dated they feel, and how poor the new trilogy it compared to the Original. Yes the special effects are better, Yes the lightsaber battles are amazing, but they lack the moral core that the original trilogy had and the motivations for the way the characters act all seem contrived.

While I would suggest anyone who is a StarWars fan keep a copy of this movie, and it is certainly cheap enough, it really doesn't live up to its own legacy.",1208131200,,3486,4.363636363636363
655619,1,6303454038,"Just watched this again on TV the other day.  The acting is simply astounding.  I can feel for the actors, as the dialogue is so atrocious that it's almost beyond belief, but still.  Were they physically prevented from doing the thing that we normally think of when the word ""acting"" is mentioned?  I mean, blurting out some dialogue, or reciting it as if you're making an emotionless statement, that's not acting.  Seriously, this is what I expect from fifth graders appearing in their very first school play.  It's just astonishes me every time one of the characters says something.  It's like a big, dumb, obvious summary of what's going on at the moment.  ""Mom, I'm not a slave any more!""  Mom:  ""All your dreams have come true.""  Said with all the emotion of ""Oh, you remembered to pick up the potato chips from the store.""  Probably 80% of the dialogue in this movie is like this.  Most first-time script readthroughs on a soap opera must be far superior to this.  Seriously, Scooby Doo has  better acting - much, much better.  I honestly can't remember ever seeing anything like this, except maybe in the worst of the worst of Sci-Fi Originals.  And even then, it's not every member of the entire cast like it is here.

Then of course there's Jar Jar, the baby talking donkey.  I guess Lucas was really reaching out for the 2 and under audience.  And the big battle at the end, with a villain we hardly know, so there's really no drama there (except what can be created with CGI), and he looks downright silly in that Halloween face paint.  Oh, let's not forget the story, as Annakin's fighter gets hit, causing him to go out of control.  He ACCIDENTALLY flies into the space station, then while shooting at some droids, ACCIDENTALLY hits the main reactor, which nicely waits for him to get to a safe distance before exploding.  Good grief, it's too stupid and pathetic to even bother criticizing.

Overall, this is an astonishingly bad movie, with dialogue that keeps one in a constant state of ""What the **** did I just see?"".  I mean, constantly,. throughout the whole film.  The action is much the same, dumb, silly, dopey.  the tone of the movie goes from ""epic drama"" to dopey silliness, back and forth, pretty much every thirty seconds.

The visual effects did not disappoint, however, the film was not without its problems. The main villian in the film, Darth Maul, promised to be the ultimate bad guy of the Star Wars saga. Although the character, played by Ray Park, was very menacing, I felt the movie spent too much time on the hated Jar Jar Binks, and not nearly enough screen time was given to Darth Maul, making Jar Jar the most hated character in Star Wars history. The film does, however, do a good job of setting up the rest of the series, giving you an introduction to key characters, and leads to the better movies in the franchise.

655761,2,6303454038,"So, this review is long-overdue, and I'm sure it's been said before:

Why did Mr. Lucas have to take, what started out as a well acted, fun series, and prequel it with this garbage?

First of all, I should say that Liam Neeson and Ewan McGreggor were excellent in this film.  Darth Maul was an ultra cool villain.  The graphics were quite cool, and probably cutting edge.  However...

1) Jar Jar Binks might be one of the biggest mistakes in recent memory.  I think GL was trying to recapture a Chewbacca-like character..... but FAILED MISERABLY.  AWFUL.  It actually polluted the entire movie for me - I felt like I was watching a made-for-TV Disney kids movie.  Hideous mistake.

2) Darth Maul had the potential of being a GREAT foe, for the duration of the movie.  Instead, he engages in a couple of really great fights, then gets killed.

3) Instead of seeing more of Darth Maul, we are forced to suffer through the cutsy-wootsy little Anakin Skywalker.  Yes, establish his innocence, before his turn to the dark side, but really..... it was too much.

4) The droids were absolutely unbelievable.  Their speech was unrealistic, and they occasionally seemed to have a sense of humor that was like watching two computer geeks talk to each other.  It seems like they tried to stick to the sterotype of how a robot might work, but then threw in a cute little spin to it - - - it made them unbelievable.

5) What's with all the racial stereotyping?  The alien guys that look like fish have unaltered Asian accents?  Why?  Why does the water-going rastafarian-wannabe Jar Jar Binks have a Jamaican accent?  Why do the Jedi's have british accents?  It looks like GL spent too much time wanting accents, and not enough time working them out.  It's kind of offensive.

In conclusion, if it weren't for Jar Jar Binks, this movie would be quite worthy of the Star Wars name.  If it weren't for all the hype about this super-villain, Darth Maul (who was so easily dispatched), when the movie came out, it would be far cooler.

I can still recall the optimistic mood and loud chatter of the crowd as we waited, and then finally filed into the theatre. I can also recall the loud remarks of disappointment within the theatre as the movie ended, followed by near silence and murmurs of disappointment as we all filed out.

This film was one of the most anticipated releases of ALL TIME. It can also be considered one of the greatest disappointments of all time. It's probably the only film ever to have achieved HUGE box office profits while actually being HATED by the majority of viewers who paid to see it. The huge box office gross was basically GUARANTEED, and does not represent HAPPY VIEWERS.

I could go into all the details as to why this film basically destroyed everything that the original TWO, and a portion of the third, had accomplished.... but then, if you're an original Star Wars fan, you already know exactly what I would write.

To sum up;

One of the most hated and disappointing films in history, that also just happens to be a huge commercial success, for no other reason than 16 years of built-up anticipation. If they had offered a ""money back, satisfaction guarantee"", I imagine the true box office figures would have been a few thousand dollars profit :)

I would also imagine that most people who purchase this film on DVD only do so to complete their collection. Then probably half of them regret the decision.

655769,2,6303454038,"What I want to say is that I really, really tried to love this movie, OK? I made a real effort. LOL.

Now, I watched Episode 1 more than once, so I didn't hate it. Each time, as with viewing any film multiple times, certain things would stick out or grab me more than others. Some aspects of the story, certain special effects or visuals, the music, dialog, specific characters, etc.,whatever, would be more prevalent, more on my mind, more in focus.

Anyway. Alright, the two things that I could not accept, that just to me are virtually impossible to ignore are:

1. Jar Jar appearing in the movie __as MUCH as he does__.
2. Darth Maul appearing in the movie __as LITTLE as he does__.

Also --and maybe this is #3-- would definitely be the way Darth Maul dies. Nope, sorry do NOT, can not buy that. Look, he just stands there. Go back and watch it if you'd like -- Darth Maul stares at Obi Wan with a frown on his face, sees Obi Wan looking over to the side staring at a light saber, and then watches as the young Jedi flies up from the shaft -right in front of him- and then comes down on his(Maul's) other side. OK, watch it again if you feel this is nit picking at all. It's absurd, __especially since Darth Maul is portrayed, in the few scenes he is in, as a total bad a**!__ What was Maul doing? He literally just stands there and then after Obi Wan lands he slowly turns around and doesn't even make a move.

Back to #1 and #2: I know, I understand Jar Jar is for the children. Fine, I got it. But, man, we all could have done with a bit less of that character. Also, they coulda toned it down a couple of times -- as for example when they are at the dinner table. You know the scene.. I thought, OMG, ""he's actually ruining the movie"". But I would have been fine with Jar Jar if he had a smaller role. #2 What the *****? Remember those AWESOME PREVIEWS with Maul in them looking so freaking bad? He was barely in the movie and instead a retarded children's comic relief imbecile was the star.

Now, look, I am familiar with the tendency, ESPECIALLY for fans, or what would be better described as SUPER-FANS to rationalize away the flaws, ample flaws, of these films. I am also aware of the common tendency to be overly critical of the movies. So, I hope that I am not simply coming across as overly critical here. All I wanted to bring up is that in watching this movie a bunch of times I could let slide a lot of stuff, but not everything.

Hope you enjoyed my two cents and let's hope future Star Wars stories are better, and are told better as well. Lucas created something special, something that I think grew larger and is greater than his ability to handle. God I wish he'd let Spielberg direct.",1201046400,4,2710,4.250485436893204

Now the good. The casting was great to me. Ewan Mcgregor was the perfect choice to show us a younger Obi Wan Kenobi. Natalie Portman was good as well. Liam Neeson, Ian MaDiarmid were good as well.

655884,2,6303454038,"This is a film that obviously divides people enormously. It is not hard to see why. In common with earlier STAR WARS films, it is a mix of similar ingredients: the profound, the comic, the noble, the villainous, the familiar, the alien, combined with newly developed action sequences that would have been impossible before CGI, which George Lucas had an enormous role in creating. The problem is that, although these elements are all present, they are not blended in satisfying proportions. Very serious subjects from slavery to ruminations with messianic overtones take a back seat to broad slapstick and often crude cartoonish comedy geared toward children. Yet, the more interesting thematic or complex plot elements--however scattered they are--would be unintelligible to children, so it's impossible to determine what the target audience was.

Because the tone of PHANTOM MENACE is impossible to gauge--scenes of potential gravity suddenly interrupted by the cheapest gags, it is ultimately unsatisfying. It also is very difficult to see how it fits in the STAR WARS saga in general. The chance meeting with a very young child named Anakin linking it with the story is treated as a subplot, and should have been dealt with in a much more inspired fashion; it should have been the core of the film or even been edited with ATTACK OF THE CLONES into a single film (CLONES  would need heavy editing, but it does anyway). Because PHANTOM MENACE is a separate film, much of the action that unfolds in the next installment has no basis or normal chronological continuity. In PHANTOM MENACE, for example, Anakin and Padme are separated by almost a generation, Padme being closer to the age of Anakin's mother than the boy. So of course there is no romantic hint here. Yet in the next episode, the age distinction seems to be lowered to no more than four or five years, and Anakin reveals that he has been in love with Padme since their first meeting. Pre-pubescnet kids don't think about much-older persons in these terms so it can't be the same Anakin, and seems to refer to a film that doesn't exist. In PHANTOM MENACE, the child Anakin merely asks if Padme is an ""angel,"" partly wishing that she is, of course, so she can rescue his mother and him from enslavement.

PHANTOM MENACE thus seems to stand on its own, which must certainly not have been the intent. It is clear that despite claims to the contrary, Lucas never had all of this worked out; it must only have been a very rough outline he had been mulling over. He was apparently not concerned about the details that he set in motion during the initial three films. Now it is Qui-Gon who is Obi-Wan's mentor, not Yoda, as was stated countless times in the original films. Now the Force is not ""something which surrounds us and binds the universe together"" as Alec Guiness' Obi-Wan told us in the first film (1977)--a very Eastern concept; it is, rather, a genetic quirk resulting from an overabundance of ""midi-chlorians"" in the blood. The Jedi thus are no longer beings of great spiritual nobility so much as the result of chromosomal ""superiority""--uncomfortably reminiscent of crackpot early 20th-century eugenics used to claim the superiority of whites over other races or Aryans over Semites (Hitler's version). It saps STAR WARS of its mythic status. It is a relief that at least the ""midi-chlorian"" eugenics are dropped in Episode II.

Overall, the few deeper ideas are entirely overwhelmed by CG special effects, the troubling demystification, and silly comedy suitable for kids' TV, most notably personified by the CGI character of Jar Jar Binks, an annoying, accident-prone ""Gungan"" who uses language in ways reminiscent of racist African-American stereotypes from the 1930s. One has to wonder how Mr. Lucas missed the latter appalling problem, or worse, if he intended it. A few minutes of Jar Jar's irritating antics would be more than enough to spoil any scene, but his unrelenting presence in every nearly every for over two hours sours anything of interest. The film has a few moments of intensity and even emotion here and there, but they are limited and eclipsed by the rest of the action; with plot and treatment so spotty, the film must be considered a failure.",1198108800,,4239,4.899721448467966

Of the eighty quadrillion reviews written or televised about this eagerly awaited Star Wars prequel, most seem to have a common summary: The film is technically brilliant, stunning and innovative in its scope and visual computer-generated wizardry, but painfully slow, actually dull in some places, and has little or no character development and little human drama.

I was disappointed to learn that the critics are correct. But let's talk about the good stuff first.

First up, there isn't a word powerful enough to describe the amazing technological leaps that Lucas had made in computer magic. Of course, Lucas founded the Industrial Light and Magic special effects company that has created some of the most innovative, impressive and memorable effects in movies for the last two decades. What's amazing is that he keeps raising the bar - the effects just keep getting better.

A full 95% of the scenes in Phantom Menace have some degree of digital component, with live people interacting seamlessly with computer-generated characters. The fully-three dimensional landscapes and scenes are so realistic that you actually get vertigo. The Jedi temple and planet Coruscan scenes are breathtaking. Make no mistake, when it comes to cinematic breakthroughs, Lucas still sets the standards others are measured by.

The little touches in Phantom Menace are nice as well - the fact that spaceships and light-sabers cast shadows on the ground, that control panels are in an alien language and not English, that you actually see waterfalls flowing in obviously computer-generated vistas, all make for a more believable experience. Also, since this prequel takes place thirty years before the other Star Wars movie, Lucas made an effort to make the technology look a little more quaint and primitive. He succeeded.

The sets - the real ones not created by computer, such as the interiors of Queen Amidala's place - shot in a real palace in Italy, are awe-inspiring. Speaking of the queen, I liked Natalie Portman as Amidala. Not just because of the interesting accent she speaks in, and the cool costumes she wears, but this 17 year old is terrific in her role as the young ruler of the planet Naboo. The movie doesn't tell us, but we know from the hype, that Amidala is destined to marry Anakin Skywalker, the future evil Darth Vader, and give birth to the twins Luke and Lea, the heroes from the fist Star Wars movies. So it's great that there's chemistry between her character and young Anakin, played by Jake Lloyd. But we'll get to him in a Moment.

Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are well-cast as the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jin and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobie. Kenobie, or course, was played with style and flair by Sir Alec Guinness in the previous Star Wars movies, and McGregor does the younger version of the character justice while still making it his own. Unfortunately, neither character is given a lot to do. Kenobie, in fact, spends much of the first part of the movie on board a ship, making repairs and talking to Qui-Gon Jin on a futuristic communicator.

Samuel L. Jackson appears in a cameo as a member of the Jedi Council; he has a lot of presence on film and you end up wishing he had more to do in the film.

Unfortunately, there's a lot to dislike about the picture, and I'll start with the most aggravating, maddeningly irritating character I have ever seen on film: The computer-generated Jar Jar Binks, who is a silly, floppy-eared vest-wearing frog-man with an absolutely incomprehensible accent. This character, supposedly played for laughs, hurts the film, and gives an infinitely greater weight to the word ""annoying"" than anything imaginable. This ""comic sidekick"" character detracts from the main story so severely that I honestly considered walking out twenty-minutes into the film.

And what's the deal with the new villain, the devil-faced Darth Maul? We get no insight into this character whatsoever, except that he is obviously a very bad man with extremely fake-looking horns glued to his head, and that he's very adept with a light-saber. Beyond that, nothing.

The battle scenes featuring entire battalions of computer generated robots and characters is breathtaking in scope, but quickly becomes a little boring. There simply isn't anything compelling about watching thousands of robots and unreal characters being killed or exploding. It's a big video game with no human connection, and really no reason to care what happens. In fact, the battle scenes are so massive and complex that the mind occasionally wanders with thoughts of, ""This must have cost a lot of money to make."" When one lengthy battle scene ended, I almost expected the screen to flash ""GAME OVER, insert 25 cents to play again.""

My biggest disappointment in the film is the waste of the character of Anakin Skywalker. This has nothing to do with actor Jake Lloyd, who plays the young version of the dark lord. Lloyd is very likable, and although his character seems written to be almost a ""Home Alone"" cute-as-pie moppet, you never get annoyed with him because he's interesting: He loves his mother, is tough but vulnerable, can fix any machine, can build androids like C3P0, and pilots a pod-racer like Mario Andretti.

And that's the biggest problem--We know that he'll grow up to be Darth Vader. But we don't believe it. Not for a second. It makes no sense. The kid is pure sugar, all ""Gee-Whiz, Mom, can I go be a Jedi, yippee!"" and there isn't even a HINT of a darker side - he never even throws a temper tantrum. This kid should be on TV, hawking Grape Juice.

Yes, the two planned sequels will deal with Anakin's transformation from good to evil, but the transition would be more believable if we saw even a glimmer of the evil that is to come. All we get is Jedi Master Yoda's cryptic feeling that the boy is dangerous. We know he'll be evil. This movie should have at least given is a glimpse of WHY. A hint. As ""Austin Powers"" Doctor Evil says, ""Throw me a bone here!""

No doubt Phantom Menace will make hundreds of millions and Star Wars fans will see it in droves repeatedly. But remembering back to the amazing explosion of the original Star Wars film in 1977, how it changed the future of movie making, and having waited 16 years for the new sequel, I was expecting a lot more story.

Much like the first Star Trek movie, which had a weak plot and was bogged down by endless special effects, Phantom Menace could have been so much more if the special effects had been pared down a notch in favor of more character development and human drama. A little more humor wouldn't have hurt either. The incredible visuals and good acting simply aren't enough to carry a movie. The underlying story feels underdeveloped.

Parts II and III are better, but that is they say, another story.",1198108800,,6978,4.95551753635586
655886,2,6303454038,"Any film awaited with the kind of hyped eagerness as THE PHANTOM MENACE, George Lucas' first STAR WARS installment in sixteen years, would have had a hard time convincing audiences and critics. However, even given that, the film is a miscalculation on George Lucas' part. Clearly, Lucas wanted to start his saga on a lighter note as a contrast with the dark deeds he had waiting in the wings for the next two ""prequels."" The problem is that he went too far. MENACE plays like an expensive Saturday morning kids' TV program. I can't help notice that many users have the same comment: ""my five-year-old loved it."" As a childrens' film, it may be successful--though I can't imagine kids following all the political goings-on or not being disturbed by the image of the slave-child Anakin being torn from his enslaved mother--a motive that is never resolved satisfactorily. For adults, MENACE doesn't hold together. The comedy is too prevalent and juvenile--including bits of ""poo-poo humor"" and the most hackneyed of slapstick gags--for any of the serious elements to work. It is typical to regard the CGI creation Jar Jar Binks as emblematic of the problems. But really, Jar Jar, however irritating he is, sets the tone of the film--a kids' movie--more than anything else. It is the tone itself that is the problem: it is unsuitable for the beginning of a monumental saga whose last three chapters (the first filmed: STAR WARS, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and RETURN OF THE JEDI) are iconic and have long been part of our common cultural language.

The core of the prequel trilogy is the rise and fall of Anakin/Darth Vader, but the Anakin we see in MENACE, as weakly played by Jake Lloyd, is far too young, even if some lines convey a certain awareness. Moreover, the age difference between him and Padme (Natalie Portman) makes an attraction troubling if he's eight when she's about sixteen in MENACE. Of course, in the next film, they reduce the difference: she only seems about twenty to Anakin's nineteen, so the issue disappears.

Lucas also introduces an idea which is very unfortunate indeed, in that it demystifies the Force as something which, as Alec Guiness's Obi-Wan describes it in STAR WARS (1977), ""surrounds us and penetrates us, binding the universe together."" In MENACE, it is reduced to the overabundance of ""midi-chlorians"" in the blood, making Jedi status a superior race, reminiscent of the horrible, crackpot, racist (and Nazi) eugenics theories of the early 20th century.

In short, THE PHANTOM MENACE could have been far superior with certain elements corrected, re-balanced, or eliminated. But Lucas didn't see it. As it stands, it would have been better as a half-hour introductory short to ATTACK OF THE CLONES.",1198022400,,2730,4.969365426695842
655887,4,6303454038,"Though it is not the first Star Wars film in many peoples minds, it is in mine. Here's my review for Star Wars Episode I, The Phantom Menace.

The Phantom Menace does not try to be anything it isn't, the film is overshadowed by the creepy, elusive, and demonically tattooed Darth Maul, that will scare the crap out of kids who have come to see something along the lines of Harry Potter. The ending battle is not overblown, and it also ends up being fairly fun to watch.

Besides some weak acting the only prominent error in the film resides in one name.

Jar Jar Binks

This stupid and irritating characters next to destroys every scene he's in, with his crontroversial manner of doing things (which some seem to believe is a Jamaican steretype, which might very well be true), his stupid way of talking and his clownish appearance he succeeds in irritating the audience to death.

I think I was putting it off because I instinctively knew it was going to be awful, and I was right.  It is one of the dullest, most atrociously acted films I've ever seen.  The acting was stody and boring, and considering the acting talent involved (Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Samuel L. Jackson), you'd think Lucas could have done something spectacular with them.  Alas, no.  Lucas has said numerous times that he detests directing (this was the first film he's directed in over 20 years since the original Star Wars film), and his contempt for directing shows.  It feels like a sonambulistic exercise, intent on putting us to sleep, and it has an overall lackadasical feel that really irks the viewer.  Many who saw this were extremely disappointed because they loved the originals so much (the original 3 are far superior than this tripe).  They more than likely felt a sense of obligation and loyalty to see this film and the progressively worse prequels.  They grew up with the original Star Wars films, and they went away disappointed and angry at the fact the prequels were inferior in every way to the originals...

Lucas's dialogue is wretched, his pacing is totally off, and he seems to be killing time here.  There's no real enthusiasm here, in front of the camera or in back of it.  Perhaps the actors picked up on the fact that Lucas didn't give a damn about his own film, so why should they?  I sometimes think Lucas purposely made bad prequels so he wouldn't have to film the final 3 chapters.  And why did he decide to make the prequels?  If he made the 3 films that were supposed to take place after Return of the Jedi, he would have had no real creative restraints.  Who knows why George Lucas does what he does?

I also couldn't think of another film that was single-handly ruined by one single character like this movie is. Yes, Jar Jar Binks has to be the worst character, not only in the Star Wars universe, but in any film ever! Trust me, he's that bad. He ruins the movie completely. And he's not even a minor character, he has more screen time than Obi-Wan and Darth Maul! Give me a break Lucas. This is really a kids movie, very childish in so many ways.

I just bought the DVD's of the all three prequels the other day. They were on sale. I watched Phantom Menace last night and my thoughts are still the same. Everytime a scene would become interesting it was quickly ruined by horrible dialogue or acting, or Jar Jar would walk in. Perhaps the most intense scene of the movie, the Darth Maul/Jedi fight, if absolutely ruined by cutting the scene back to Jar Jar stumbling around.

This movie was the biggest letdown. Yes, I was expecting a lot, but this is a really bad movie on its own, not connected to the other three films.

I guess back in 2001 when everyone had small TVs no one noticed, but I have a 70"" screen and, compared to the Episode III DVD, the image quality in this one sucks.

I know Episode I was the last Star Wars flick shot with film instead of digital cameras, but, come on, it was edited in computers! It makes no sense to further degrade the image by transferring it from digital to film and then back to digital... unless you are planning to re-release it as a ""Digitally remastered"" version for the 10th anniversary (Which I hope they do, along with the HD DVD and Blu-ray versions)",1189296000,,853,4.496774193548387
656034,4,6303454038,"I believe George Lucas said he was inspired by the chariot race in the 1959 epic Ben-Hur, and thought of it often when he staged the big pod race scene in this movie.

So, when I watched the film again the other day, the third or fourth time I've seen it, I kept looking for comparisons. Well, suffice to say nothing will surpass that chariot race, which had no benefit of any special-effects while this was almost all computer-generated. Nevertheless, the pod race in here was a lot of fun to watch, had excellent surround sound, was exciting and the highlight of the film. Oddly, in this movie instead of a man you have a small boy as the good guy- driver, so to speak. Young Jake Lloyd who plays ""Anakin Skywalker."" He's the key character in this Star Wars saga, the boy who later becomes the father to Luke Skywalker and winds up being revealed as Darth Vader. But....this is long before that

This movie, the first Star Wars movie after a long hiatus (16-years) disappointed a lot of fans but I thought it was entertaining overall. My main complaint was trying to understand ""Jar Jar Binks,"" but on the DVD I can use English subtitles and thus understand all the strange things he says with his Caribbean accent. It makes the movie more enjoyable and I strongly recommend doing that.

As usual, there is a ton of astounding visuals in here, all kinds of strange characters and excellent ""effects."" Yes, the action gets hokey in spots, especially near the end, but what modern-day action film doesn't?

People who are really ""into"" this Star Wars saga, and take it seriously, were, as mentioned generally let down with this movie. I guess they expected a lot more after waiting so long for the next installment. I just watch it for the enjoyment of an escapist film and as someone who usually enjoys good visuals.

There seems to be a lack of any middle ground, which is a bit ludicrous, I think.  This movie had numerous memorable characters and a few rather forgettable ones.

The good:

Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi
Natalie Portman as Padme
Scenes with Darth Maul
A young Yoda... well, younger anyway.
The visual aspects of the film are generally excellent.

The Bad:

Jar Jar

656134,1,6303454038,"The immortal main theme begins. The orange words appear: ""Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlying systems is in dispute. Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo..... this alarming chain of events...""

We sit in wonder, our popcorn halfway to our mouths, as a chill runs down our spines. Good lord! A trade dispute. A blockade of a small planet.  A chain of events (albeit quite a small chain, only a couple of links).

This is the stuff of which epics are made?

What is the purpose of the blockade? Shouldn't the Trade Federation want to trade with Naboo? Perhaps the T.F. wants to charge higher prices? If so, why are we never told that? We are never, in fact, told anything about the dispute, other than it is trivial and legal. (Qui-Gon says ""... something as trivial as this trade dispute..."" Viscount Gunray says ""Our blockade is perfectly legal"") So, having been officially told that the plot opening is a legal, trivial trade dispute, we might think that the first exciting scene would be a  committee hearing by economic experts.

How could Mr. Lucas give us so lackluster a start to so eagerly anticipated a movie?

Ah yes...Queen Amidala. Now, the films do demonstrate, that Mr. Lucas's general knowledge of politics, government, and diplomacy is so minuscule that it could all be engraved on the head of a pin with lots of room left, but in the polity of Naboo he has confected something particularly fascinating: a democratic monarchy--a ""queen"" who is elected and subject to term limits. (We never hear of any kings; perhaps a matriarchal democracy? Unique.) This ""queen"" is required to wear preposterous costumes that change hourly and coiffures not seen since the court of Louis XVI. Surely she would have little time to do much governing, being too busy with her clothes and hair. (But that might be a good idea, since the office of monarch apparently has no age qualification and in this crisis Naboo is governed by a girl of perhaps eighteen. That's the best they could come up with? And she, we are told in Part II, is 'not the youngest' ever chosen. One would have liked to see the youngest, who perhaps ruled from a cradle rather than a throne.)

The Gungan ""government"" is also interesting. The oddly-titled ""Boss"" Nass is evidently not a Gungan at all--or from a superior race of Gungans, who look entirely different than those they govern? It doesn't seem quite right.

So we arrive on Tatooine, where a serious difficulty arises: the ship's hyperdrive is kaput.  It is vital that the ship get going ASAP--a matter of galactic importance, in fact. Only one dealer has the needed part. The dealer will not accept Republic currency.
 Now, what is a resourceful, masterful, intelligent Jedi to do? Here are some choices; which would you choose?
 A: Go to a bank and convert your currency into the local stuff.
 B: Inform Wattoo, the overgrown house fly, that the Jedi Order is commandeering his hyperdrive and will wire him the money. If he objects, take it by force.
 C: Wait around doing nothing until you accidentally discover that a small child might get you the money by winning a race (although this child has never won a race).
 What Qui-Gon does is so absurd, only Lucas could have come up with it.

A side note: Qui-Gon asks Obi-Wan if they have anything to trade with. He replies that they have little but ""the queen's wardrobe"". Folks, if that queen brought her whole wardrobe,  it could be traded for most of the starships on the planet with Jabba the Hutt thrown in.

Anakin's poor mother: now here is perhaps the biggest, most glaring plot hole in the whole series. Why in heaven is she left as a slave? The Jedi are willing to take a 9-year-old boy away from his only parent and forget about the woman. No effort to free her, now or later, even after Anakin shows her a pile of cash and says ""look how much we won"". I guess he keeps it and leaves mom to the mercy of the giant fly.

""Gungans go to sacred place."" The Trade Federation has occupied the whole planet. They know about the underwater city. Yet thousands of these not terribly inconspicuous Gungans manage to move to a spot on the surface that the T.F. never even notices. One wonders how they did that. But of course we must reckon with ""Lucas logic"" as well as ""Star Wars physics"" in these movies. This also applies to the production of dei ex machinae as needed. You must get into the city? Voil, ""the secret passage on the waterfall side."" Thank heaven for secret passages. And how we rejoice at the pistols concealed in the arm of a chair, a chair in which Newt Gunray has been sitting for weeks without discovering them.

When the big door goes up and Darth Maul appears, the Jedi say ""we'll handle this"" and all the others--about a dozen armed men--just leave (to ""take the long way""). Why? Why doesn't everyone open fire and kill the Sith right there?

One could go on listing absurdities and inconsistencies in this silly movie, but enough of examples. The more important question is, why? Why is the film so bad? Why is any thoughtful viewer left feeling he has been cheated?
 I think the answer can be found on the commentary track, where Mr. Lucas and several mechanics talk to us.
 My chief impression of these comments is one of men so mesmerized by technology that they have lost sight of other things. The animators and CGI functionaries--these hod-carriers of the computer world-- are insufferable. On and on they go with details of how this or that shot was done, incessantly telling us of their cleverness, their expertise, their great accomplishments. One feels a bit ""wude"" in saying this, but, folks, we don't care how you did it. What you do is of no more interest to most viewers than the building of sets or the stitching of costumes. You are hewers of imaginary wood and drawers of digitized water. Do your jobs, cash your paychecks, and be quiet. We, the audience, care merely about the finished products. Save your war stories for others in your profession. No doubt you deserve well of your master, undoubtedly other CGI people will care to know the details of your skilled work, but don't monopolize the commentary track with yet another description of how you made dust appear realistic or inserted a suitably jerky movement into a puppet. Sheesh!

 Mr. Lucas's comments suggest he is an overgrown adolescent, like Peter Jackson. One hopes in vain for some commentary on things like the government system of Naboo or on what reaction he expected from the startling announcement of Anakin's virgin birth (made before we learn of the midi-chlorians). But it is interesting that he frequently compares his work to that of a composer of music, referring again and again to ""tone poems"" and such things. I can only suggest that, if he views his movies as a symphony, he should have let John Williams do the directing as well as the composing. The result would probably have been superior.

 Finally, a tribute to Jar-Jar Binks. I am not being perverse. I like him. He brings to the film a much-needed element of humor. He does not take himself too seriously. He is genuine. He is humble. He is grateful. He helps his friends. I bet he wouldn't leave a child's mother in slavery. As for his language, I find his dialect to be more refreshing, alive, and natural than that of a character who for no apparent reason always backwards speaks, whose verbs at the end of his sentences puts, and who so insufferably smug is that I almost wish Count Dooku his little green head had off cut.",1184198400,18,7660,4.659006671608599
656135,4,6303454038,"There were many good points to this movie. First, you get to see young Anakin. You get to see his humble beginnings and hear the mother tell how she immaculantly conceived her son. To me, this suggests someone such as Darth Sidious (The eventual EMPEROR) perhaps influenced ""the force"" to somehow impregnate Anakin's mom. (Thus making Ultimate Evil the grandfather of Luke Skywalker)

If you think about it, that makes sense, But the good in the mother ""white washed"" some of the bad of each father out of the offspring. Anakin's mom's goodness allows Anakin to struggle with good vs bad. He eventually turns bad, but it's not easy and he's not really happy about it. His evil is cut in half from the emperor's because Anakin/Darth Vader has a heart. Has the capacity for love. And this comes to light when he finally learns to love Luke in Episode Six. (His love for Padme is almost part of his undoing).
Padme's goodness is what tempers Luke and Leia's hearts and keeps them from turning. (Likewise I imagine this happens further on down the line, but you never know unless you read the books, because there aren't anymore movies to go on.)

ANYWAY, let's rein in the tangent truck here. The point is this movie, Episode 1. It's a great flick. There just should have been Less JAR-JAR and more Darth Maul!

It sets up another problem. I realize Anakin is apparently a few years younger than Padme, but this is just skirted over as the series wanes on. He's a boy when they first meet. How are we to believe they fall in love when she's like 25 when they meet and he's like 10?

All in all, my least favorite of the six. But from such a Star Wars Fanatic, even my least favorite is still very much enjoyed!",1184025600,,1707,4.479099678456592
656136,3,6303454038,"STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE would have had to have been beyond perfect to survive the almost twenty years of fan anticipation and the avalanche of hype it was met with. When released in 1999, reactions to THE PHANTOM MENACE were very mixed. Disappointed (even embittered) fans claimed that George Lucas had created THE PHANTOM MENACE merely to cash in on the STAR WARS franchise---as if he needed to ""cash in"" on what had already become a multibillion dollar enterprise. As a result, the whole ""prequel"" trilogy got a bad reputation, none worse than this film.

Revisiting it years later, after all the shouting has died down, THE PHANTOM MENACE seems far better than it did upon its release. It doesn't measure up to any of the films of the original trilogy. It may in fact be the weakest film of the sextet. THE PHANTOM MENACE suffers from the same mistaken approach that George Lucas has adopted toward his ""improved"" versions of the original films. THE PHANTOM MENACE has most of the same shortcomings, particularly the (very common) sci-fi bugaboo of using a film to showcase special effects. Lucas gave us a truly Shakespearean tale in the first trilogy, and incidentally set it ""a long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."" The spaceships, the ray guns, and the alien life forms propelled the story, but they were NOT the story.

Lucas wants to show us all kinds of new, colorful, and beautiful visions in THE PHANTOM MENACE, and he does, but at great expense to the storyline, which meanders all the way from Point A to Point A Prime in this installment.

There's even greater expense to the characterizations. We could relate to Luke, Leia, Han, See Threepio and Artoo Detoo in the first trilogy because they were like us in so many ways. Han Solo especially served to ground the STAR WARS universe in familiarity. Han's ""scoundrel"" energy was very central to the success of the original movies.

There isn't a lovable scoundrel in THE PHANTOM MENACE. Lucas does give us some truly interesting new characters, but they're alien (both literally and figuratively) and we hardly get to know them.

The young Queen of Naboo, Padme Amidala (played by Natalie Portman, one of the beautiful new visions in this film) is oft-times regally remote, and somewhat mysterious. Her lookalike decoy is played by Keira Knightley (another beautiful new vision), and it is truly difficult to tell them apart at times.

Although Portman's Amidala shows herself to be clearly a warm, open, and sympathetic character, by the end of THE PHANTOM MENACE we know much less about her than we do about her cinematic daughter, Princess Leia, in A NEW HOPE.

Young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) is a slave-child on Tatooine. An inventor and a gifted pilot even at the age of eight, he is so bright-eyed and kindhearted (""Someday, I'll come back here and free all the slaves"") that it is difficult to reconcile this gentle little boy who cries for his mother with the horrific Darth Vader he eventually becomes.

The Jedi Council initially refuses to allow Anakin to be trained as a Jedi (""There is much fear in you, young one,"" says Yoda). We never really see his fear or feel it. Nor do we get much more than a glimmer of the rage and anger he must feel as a slave. Watto, his owner, is a straw boater wearing, comical-looking flying bumblebee/vulture who speaks with a vaudeville Italian accent. Simon Legree should not be doing stand-up. By making Watto a figure of fun, Lucas fails to either underscore the weaknesses of the Galactic Republic, or presage its descent into darkness.

Essentially, we have only the criticisms of the Jedi Masters to go on in consigning young Anakin to the Minus Column. It just isn't enough, especially when he wins the high stakes podrace that is the main act of the story (the stakes being his own freedom), and is eventually responsible for firing the well-placed shot that defeats the enemy in battle (like his cinematic son, Luke).

The oddly mismatched love between the prepubescent Anakin and the much older teenaged Padme comes out of nowhere, with hardly a forethought (Anakin's shy question to the girl at their first meeting---""Are you an angel?""---is the only indicator of what later blossoms).

Likewise, Lucas utterly wastes two of his most intriguing characters, the iconoclastic Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn, and the truly satanic Darth Maul. Qui-Gon is wise. Qui-Gon is skilled. Qui-Gon should have been Obi-Wan's Obi-Wan and Anakin's ally. But although Qui-Gon is instrumental in freeing Anakin from bondage, he never develops a truly affectionate (Obi-Wan and Luke-type) relationship with the boy, seeming more interested in him as raw material for Jedi training.

The silent Darth Maul, (the evil lord of shopping centers) with his horned black-and-red face, twin-ended lightsaber, glowing sulfur-yellow eyes, kendo-style fighting technique, and flowing black robes is potentially a figure as memorable and frightening as Darth Vader, but both he and Qui-Gon die in battling one another; and so a fascinating second trilogy dynamic between good and evil dies with them.

Added to these missed opportunities are odd inconsistencies between THE PHANTOM MENACE and the original trilogy. See Threepio turns out to have been built by Anakin on Tatooine, but then why didn't the droid recognize Tatooine or the name ""Skywalker"" in A NEW HOPE? Although Ben Kenobi claims to have been trained by Yoda in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, he is clearly Qui-Gon's student in THE PHANTOM MENACE. Tatooine is ruled by the Hutts in this film, but not in the original trilogy. Although Anakin's mother references Tatooine's twin suns, they're never seen together in the sky.

Clearly, Lucas couldn't have reworked the original films after 20 years to fit all these elements in THE PHANTOM MENACE. Their inclusion here is a sign of his hubris. Why not just be true to the original? Clearly, his desire to make these changes overrode any considerations of film continuity and audience expectations. George Lucas isn't really trying to give us a better cinematic experience here, he's just totally into playing with his favorite toys. It's a form of selfishness.

Possibly the worst of Lucas's new ideas is the Social Darwinist/Nazi race theory concept of a high ""midichlorian"" count giving rise to greater Force sensitivity. Anakin has a mythic virgin birth due to the midichlorians, a bad twist to the tale when one considers that Lucas could have underscored the horrors of slavery by having Anakin fathered by a freeborn man who exploited Shmi Skywalker's position as a slave. Here, once again, the film fails to foreshadow the lawlessness and unethical evils of the rising Galactic Empire.

STAR WARS isn't sociology, but it's insistence on touching universal themes is what made it so wildly successful. The first trilogy was constructed entirely upon the foundation of our shared collective subconscious. Lucas loses that thread in this film.

The inclusion of the midichlorian factor means that the Jedi are no longer a highly-trained spiritual fraternity. They've become racially superior to the rest of us. If ever he re-edits THE PHANTOM MENACE, the midichlorians must end up on the cutting room floor. Sorry, but as ideas go, this one just stinks.

And speaking of stinks, Lucas also brought us the ridiculous Jar-Jar Binks and his race of Rastafari amphibians, the Gungans (Ganja, anyone?). Jar-Jar Binks is a technically interesting additional character, being primarily a CGI character; but he adds nothing (and detracts much) from the film with his distracting brainless chatter, clumsiness, and utter stupidity. If Lucas thought that this duckbilled dunce would provide comic relief, he was wrong. See Threepio and Artoo Detoo serve that purpose in the first trilogy and should have continued to do so in THE PHANTOM MENACE. Jar-Jar merely irritates the viewer, particularly given that he appears throughout the film, not just in a few scenes. He's merely filler. As filler, he's a sign that Lucas wasn't imaginative enough to use THE PHANTOM MENACE's screen time to its best advantage by progressing the storyline.

Binks may be the only character ever that inspired a website advocating his destruction, the aptly-named [...] What was George Lucas thinking when he gave us the jarring Jar-Jar?

THE PHANTOM MENANCE is uneven and inconsistent and suffers from some poor scriptwriting and too many missed opportunities. These reduce the film, but do not ruin it. Despite its weaknesses and flaws, THE PHANTOM MENACE is a solid THREE STAR effort. It is essential to the telling of the tale, and leaves us considering what's next?

In that regard, THE PHANTOM MENACE is as successful as any film can be. It finally gives us the entertaining and engaging introduction to that long time ago and far away galaxy we've come to know and love.",1182384000,,8869,4.995257452574526

You see, in this highly-anticipated prequel, Quack-Gonn Jinn explains the force to Anakin Snobbwalker. He explains how the force is really just a bunch of microorganisms (similar to sweat) that live in your cells and boss you around. However, in Episode V, Yoda (who in Episode I looks like a monkey) claims that the force is something that surrounds every living thing (something like that). If Yoda is a heretic, that means he's bad. If he's bad, then why do you see him with the good jedi at the end of Episode VI? Meeesa have bad feelzing about this. Can you guess who meeesa is? Youssa right! Issa meeesa, I'mgonnahityouovertheheadwithajellyjar-jar-Bonks.

Jar-Jar - Exqueese me! You saved my life! Meeesa your servant for life!

Qui-Gonn - Yes, Jar-Jar. If I were in my right mind, I would slash you with my lightsaber until I could see the individual atoms that you're made of. However, I'm never in my right mind, so I will bear with your company. What's more, I'll even take you with me, so that everyone aboard my ship will lose their minds when you crack fart jokes every five seconds.

Obi-Wan finally meets Jar-Jar. He would also slash him to pieces; however, that would mean he'd lose Jedi points, because destroying an unarmed creature is against the jedi rule. It's bad enough that Padme likes snobby, most-horrible-actor-in-the-world Anakin, but she likes Bonks. How is that possible? I think Jar-Jar is a Sith! How else could anyone like him, than by using Jedi mind tricks? How else could he not die, when thousands of battle droids are around him and none hear his ridiculous screams?

Finally, we see the villain of the movie! Darth Maul, who is not in it at all! What does he do in the movie? Except for some incredibly awesome lightsaber moves, he rolls his eyes! Probably an addiction he developed when going through the movie's storyline with Lucas.

656140,5,6303454038,"Of the 3 new episodes, this is by far the best one.  It has a captivating storyline and never ceases to amaze with the fantastic CGI special effects at every angle.  Many die-hard SW fans do not approve of all the CGI, but I believe that feeling goes hand in hand with the fact that they were around when the first SW came out, and that film was ""theirs"" so to speak and can never be duplicated.  Something so magnificent as SW in 1977 must've captivated the mind and created such a frenzy that many opinions will be biased some 30 years later.  I was not born yet when the first ones came out, but I'm a fan of all 6 and didn't really understand the SW buzz until I was able to watch the first 3 (newer ones) in succession followed by Episodes IV, V, and VI.  Many fans have seen it the other way around, but I find the SW saga to still be enjoyable if you watch them in numerical order.

Of course, as a young buck myself, I will gladly say that Episodes I-III are great.  A true treat to eye and a gem in fantasy/sci-fi land if you're in to that type of genre.  Lucas could've not created anything better in my eyes.  As I stated earlier, many old-school fans don't appreciate the new ones and that's completely understandable.  For me and my generation, my Star Wars films were The Lord of the Rings trilogies.  For me, I will go to my grave saying that LOTR was and is the best film of the genre.  Hopefully they will make more as Tolkien wrote a lot, but I will not appreciate them as much as LOTR.  That's just the way it is I guess.",1181520000,3,1540,4.12751677852349

Sure, I have some quarrals with TPM: the pace could've used a bit of a jump start, following a structure like ANH had, and the Gungans seemed out of place in the SW Universe (though there were things I liked about them).  And yeah, Jar Jar got on my nerves a little in places (mostly at the beginning) but his antics were funny in several others.  I thought Anakin's beginnings made sense, though I think he should've been a little older & I loved the fact that he built 3PO.  I loved the planet of Naboo & there is just something cool about the droid armies.

I was a little disappointed by the space battle & thought Lucas made a big mistake by killing off Darth Maul.  I understand his reasoning but as much as I love Count Dooku & Lee's performance, Maul should've been the `Vader' of the prequals.

Star Wars jumped the shark with this movie and it never truly recovered.  Though I liked RoTS and thought AoTC was okay, I could not truly take them seriously like the original trilogy partly because this crappy movie sucked all credibility out of the franchise. This gets my vote for the WORST Star Wars movie ever made.",1180310400,6,630,4.980952380952381
656205,4,6303454038,"I have been an avid fan of Star Wars since 1977. I was[..]when I saw it and I was hooked ever since. The premieres of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi were major events in my family's lives. Even after Jedi and into my teenage years, I still held on to my love of the Star Wars saga.

I just want to say that I am not the type of SW fan who buys everything with the words ""Star Wars"" on it. Besides the DVDs, soundtracks, and a handful of of books/novels, that's as far as my ""collecting"" goes.

When Episode One came out in '99, my friends and family EAGERLY awaited its release, but I did not camp out or spend hours (or weeks like some knuckleheads did) in line waiting to get tickets. I went the day it opened, got in line about 45 minutes before the starting time, got a great seat, and enjoyed experiencing what it was like to be a kid again.

I will never understand all of the bad reviews and negative opinions so many people had about this film. To me, it was everything a Star Wars film should be. It had thrilling special effects, tons of action, a great story, memorable characters, and it introduced me to worlds and places that I had never even dreamed of.

It was amazing to see the Jedi order in their heyday and to finally find out where Darth Vader came from and how the Old Republic began to crumble. This movie and its story are the stuff of legends.

The ONLY fault I can find in the film was that the dialogue was a bit flat and sometimes unconvincing. The original trilogy films were rife with memorable and quotable lines, but the prequel films seemed to be lacking in that department.

I know a lot of people will hate me for writing this, but the character of Jar Jar Binks was NOT THAT BAD! I chuckled a little bit at his antics and agree that he did get a little too much screen time, but all in all, I didn't find him to be anywhere near as annoying as most people have made him out to be.

The moment the words ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..."" appeared on the screen, tears began to form in my eyes. It made me remember how much fun Star Wars was and still is and made me feel like a kid again. How can a ""bad"" movie move a person like that?

The scene where Anakin says goodbye to his mother and follows Qui-Gon out of the city and the ""Force Theme"" plays, it makes me bawl like a baby every time. That scene is so touching and amazingly crafted.

I think a lot of ""fans"" went to see this film with preconceived notions of how it was going to be. The same thing can be said about the first Star Wars film in 1977. Everyone thought it was going to be a stupid sci-fi film that would quickly be forgotten, but it became an American icon.

If one watches this film objectively and places it in the proper context within its relation to all six films, you can gain a deeper appreciation for the Star Wars saga.

This is a VERY GOOD film. Each time you watch it, you can come away with something new that you never caught in your previous viewings.

Today is the 30th birthday of the original Star Wars film and thus, the birth of a timeless saga. It's hard to believe that so much time has passed since then, but thankfully, we have the DVDs available to help remind us of what it was like to be young again....",1180051200,14,3266,4.134069400630914

Jake Lloyd did some good acting, but to many of us it may seem like he possessed too much naivete to become Darth Vader so quick. Also, he was a little childish, even if he was only, what? Nine? Ewan McGregor was an excellent choice to play Obi-Wan Kenobi, mainly because he did such a good job, but also that he was able to keep the job throughout the three prequels.

This movie has some of the best special effects and great lightsaber effects, with all the noises timed perfectly. Darth Maul was a nice twist, with his double-bladed lightsaber.

656294,5,6303454038,"All right. This has been stewing within me for several years, and I'm finally going to put my two cents in about this episode of Star Wars.

I saw this movie for the first time at midnight near to the first night it came out, courtesy of my father's job. :) I enjoyed every moment, even Jar Jar who later came to annoy me. In fact, I saw it three or four more times in the theatres.

From what I have read and heard from critics is that this is the worst Star Wars film to date. They say that the acting is horrible, the special effects try to cover a botched-up story, that it can never compare with Episodes IV, V, and VI of yore, and that George Lucas has lost his touch.

Let me break this down by my standards:

The acting is horrible? Though some of the acting in Episodes II and III leave a bit to be desired (George Lucas needs to stop writing love scenes until he learns that ""You're tormenting me"" is a stupid line!), can you really say that the acting in the original trilogy was any better? No, you really can't. Now, I love the original trilogy, but seriously, some of that acting was pretty bad. (""But I wanted my power converters!"") Everyone seems to really hate Jake Lloyd as Anakin the most. People, he was TEN YEARS OLD at the time! He did an awesome job for a ten-year-old. Honestly, stop judging him alongside huge Hollywood actors that are decades older than he was. I haven't seen any better acting from children anyway. On to the next.

A botched-up story? I won't deny that under the special effects there isn't a really STRONG story, but remember, ""The Phantom Menace"" is supposed to be a set-up for the following films, not a stand-alone epic. Think about ""A New Hope,"" the first of the original. It was also a set-up for the following films, and it also did not have an exactly epic storyline. ""The Phantom Menace"" flowed much more in the epic vein than ""A New Hope"" ever did.

It can't compare with the original trilogy? That isn't true. The special effects have leaped ahead, and the story is every bit as good. But for those of you who were raised with the original trilogy, you couldn't disagree more, right? Take a step back and look at the bigger picture. You were raised with Luke, Leia and Han Solo (as was I), and growing up with those films gave you a natural bias against the newer Star Wars films. You expected to see more of the same at the theatre, and when you didn't it either saddened you or plain made you mad. Now, there's nothing wrong with that, you just need to realize that you have that bias whether you like it or not. If you didn't, I'm sure you would have liked ""The Phantom Menace.""

Besides this, you have to respect that this film as well as Episodes II and III have brought in a whole new generation of Star Wars fans. Now, some of you may be thinking ""They don't know anything about the REAL Star Wars!"" Not true, so stop thinking like you were the creator of Star Wars.

George Lucas lost his touch? That is a very wrong thing to say. Not only did Lucas give you the oh-so-wonderful original trilogy, this is HIS story. He knew what he wanted to happen in it. To say that he has lost his touch is to insult his story and so insult the original trilogy that you all love so much more. Without George Lucas, you wouldn't have Star Wars AT ALL. Now, you may disagree with some of his ideas, but it is ultimately HIS story, not yours. Besides, saying that gives you a very arrogant appearance.

Now, with that out of the way, this really is a gorgeous film. I can't recommend it more. Before you rebel against it, try to give it an unbiased chance. You may find yourself changing your mind.",1170115200,8,3646,4.303206997084548

I'll admit that I too had enjoyed the originals. But that's because I was born in the late seventies and I was a kid when I watched them. When you're a kid you don't care about things like plotline, or dialogue or acting. You just want to see some good lightsaber fighting. Now when this film came out I had somewhat lost interest in Star Wars movies, but I thought I would still give it a shot. Disappointing. Something happened to me since 1980. I grew up. Now I have to expect more from a film than just state of the art special effects. Sub-par plot line,  mediocre acting, and completely uninteresting one-dimentional characters were just some of the disapointments in this film. Even Liam Neeson (whom is a good actor by the way) was not used to his full potential.

The only plus in this movie was the lightsaber fight at the end. The character Darth Maul had some impressive moves and the visual effects were worth seeing. Maul played by an actor with some talent (not necessarily in the acting department) but in the martial arts/acrobatic department, made the saber battle worth watching.

So, in conclusion, this movie did not live up to the old movies. The original trilogy wasn't especially great when it came to acting or dialogue, but at least the characters were somewhat interesting and had some mild chemistry between them. In this film, virtually none of that. Fans of the originals should be disappointed. And as for George Lucas, hang your head in shame.",1168560000,2,1625,4.615916955017301

It starts the storyline of Star Wars, and we are introduced to several pivitol characters at the early stage of their importance to the plotlines. It is really a Genesis story for the Star Wars saga.

The pod race scene (many complained how it didn't fit the rest of the storylines) was a bit of an intergallactic American Graffiti with some high speed adventure and quite a spectacle - it's a fun segment, even if the impact on the overall story is minimal (soume would argue that the whole thing could have been skipped).

Jar Jar Binks, the goofy Gungan exile, has gone down into infamy as the most hated creature/character according to the general Star Wars Fan Base due to some annoying manner of speech, but his goofy antics were adding some comic relief and are easily overlooked, if not ignored.

The shining point of the movie is the lightsaber battles - the complexity and martial richness was what Lucas has pined for all these years and technology finally was starting to catch up to his imagination. Darth Maul is one of the best Sci Fi villians to ever grace the silver screen, and engages in some dynamic combat with the stalwart Jedi Knights. Duel of the Fates is, perhaps, one of the best sci fi fight scenes to date.

It seems that he rufused any insight from anyone else and took on this project by his ego-maniacal self. When he collaborated with screenwriter greats like Lawrence Kasden in the past films, the films turned out great mostly because of the great character development and the on-screen chemistry between the characters. Unfortunatly, he thought he could do it himself on this one. And what was the turnout: Over two hours of the most audience insulting #$%* ever invented. The characters had absolutely no life and the dialogue was painful to hear.

The CGI was horrendous. What is the deal with modern filmakers sacrificing substance for crap like CGI. Yes, it is essential at times, but it doesn't need to dominate an entire movie like GL did with this piece of fluff.

There was no character development at all. You didn't care at all for any of the characters and most of the ""main"" characters were really one dimensional.

The storyline was uninteresting and the whole midichlorians crap ruins everything the old Star Wars movies stood for. So George, you are great because you were born like that? No one has the choice to make themselves truly heroic? It all depends on something you were born with? That's just absurd. You completely betrayed your fans with this awful movie.

If this movie was made 20 years before it came out, it probably would have been a lot better because I believe George Lucas would have had a lot more help.

Natalie was decent and I never cringed at Jake Lloyd like most.  Threepio to me is the most annoying thing about the prequels and one where Lucas tried (and failed) to up the humor factor.

656492,2,6303454038,"What the Hell happened to Lucas?

How could he go from a wordy but brilliant writer/director to a creator of this dross?  In recent years, I've decided that I've been too harsh on my initial views of ""Phantom"" (I guess seeing where he was finally going in ""Sith"" made me appreciate the little things in here more), however, this reassessment has NOT made me decide this film was in any shape ""good"" or measured up to ""Star Wars.""

Where to begin?  Well, let's start with the bad.  Lucas has obviously fallen in love with what can be done with CGI.  The special effects in here, like the trial balloon effects he did in the reedited first trilogy, are breathtaking.  He seemed to forget, however, that jaw-dropping vistas and lifelike illusions are no replacement for characters we care about and plot that actually make sense.  A lot of people blame poor Jake Lloyd for being a bad Anakin, but he was all of 8 when ""Phantom"" was made.  It was also his first major movie.  A good director can make a zucchini passable and a child actor good.  Lucas dropped the ball with him, though, and without proper mentoring, he probably felt like a real-life Dorothy dropped in an Oz not of his own making.

Oh, yes, let's not leave out the dialogue.  Lucas has been known for his ""wordy"" characters, but here we go over the top with whole technobabble soliloqueys about ""Midichlorians"" and the Sith ""having (their) revenge"" with no subtext, no connection with any past that an ""extended universe"" virgin would undertand.  And the hints of racism that permeate the whole production (the ""chinee waiter"" Trade Fed leader Neomoideans were only a start) hint at darker things to come, such as Jar Jar Binks.

Ah, Jar Jar Binks.  The Ugly.  Entire books have been written trying to surmise just what the Hell Lucas was thinking when he put this Stepinfechit/Mushmouth lovechild so prominently in an important chapter of his story.  I have to admit that the CGI on him was first-rate - he really seemed to be with the human characters - yet he really was a horrorshow, as he mirrored all those happy, bouncing ""House Negro"" characters so prominent in '30s film.  One has to wonder what photos of Ahmad Best Lucas has in his office safe to make him go along (and defend in interview after interview) with bringing Binks to shuffling ""mesa okey-day boyos"" life.  And I was unfair to Bill Cosby's beloved character by comparing him with Binks, but really, doesn anyone even KNOW what the heck he's saying?  Even Lucas probably isn't sure.

After all that crapping on ""Phantom"" (sorry if it was a bit much, but when I saw it in the cinema, I had such high hopes for it and they were bitterly shot down in flames, so it's hard to be kind), you'll probably wonder just what I see ""good"" in it.  Well, actually, quite a lot - not ""whole film"" quantities, but enough to keep me from attempting to leave a ""zero"" as my rating.  I can't deny the beauty of Lucas's worlds, even the desolate Tattoine, and he really knows how to create action sequences (the lightsabre duels and podrace sequence did recapture some of my childhood ""wow"").  The occasional bit of slapstick does bring a giggle to me, when they're not overused (too many flatulence/gas gags).  But what saves the film is the cast.  And what a cast it is - Ewan Macgregor as a youthful Obi-Wan, Liam Neeson as the grumpy-yet-caring Qui-Gon, and the beautiful Natalie Portman as Padme'.  Brilliant and able to make us care about our folks despite - not because of - Lucas's hackwork.

So, the bottom-line; is it essential?  I'd have to say, very-reluctantly, yes.  We get to see the development of a sarcastic apprentice Obi-Wan and know he wasn't always all-wise.  We get to see Qui-Gon bucking the Jedi system and showing a depth of compassion for his charges we'd need another half-hour of film time anywhere else (and with anyone else other than Neeson).  And we get to see the last, painful moments of innocence from Anakin Skywalker (please, again, give young Jake a break.

I had so greatly been looking forward to this film and was so excited to have a Star Wars I could call my own (as in made in my generation) only to find out that it was a piece of garbage full of bad/flat, lifeless acting, a story full of plotholes and inconsistencies with the original trilogy and enough CGI to make your eyes bleed.

The actors, including heavy weights like Liam Neeson and Samuel L. Jackson, up and comers Natalie Portman, and gradually progressing into leading man status Ewan McGregor, are all wasted here. Neeson, McGregor and Jackson are OK but OK is all they are, but they don't stand out at all, nor does Portman. All I can say of Jake Lloyd is that he looks like he's having fun. Then there's Jar Jar Binks, ARGH. What was Lucas thinking? And poor Darth Maul got killed before we had a chance to get to know him.

But what's most offensive of all, aside from the lifeless/passionless acting, are the continuity errors. All these years we were led to believe that Obi-Wan (McGregor) risked a lot to make Anakin a Jedi Knight, but here Obi-Wan's little more than a 2nd banana lurking in the background, while Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson) is at the front line doing what he can to get Anakin ahead, and it's just wrong. That was what hurt me the most, the fact that the film wasn't about Obi-Wan, that it didn't adhere to previous Star Wars history.

And Episode 2, alas, isn't that big of an improvement.",1157068800,8,1494,4.425454545454546

656595,4,6303454038,"This is the Best Star Wars Movie ever! Here are all the reasons why I love this movie:

1. Jar-Jar Binks is an excellent addition to the Star Wars universe. He is a deep and powerful character that is wonder to watch. He brings a certain intensity to the series that we have never seen before.

2. We hear people say ""Poo-Doo"" a lot, and we all know what THAT means! That's just hilarious. It made me chuckle every time I heard it.

3. Jar-Jar gets hit in the groin. More hilarity! That just cracked me up.

4. The way Jar-Jar talks is the best! ""Me-sa tinkin' we-sa bein' in deep poo-doo bom-bad!"" Poetry. Sheer poetry.

5. Jar-Jar has a long tongue, which is really funny. He gets it electrocuted, sticks it out at Qui-Gon, uses it to eat frogs and fruit, and other REALLY FUNNY things.

6. A big animal farts, which makes Jar-Jar hold his nose and say ""Pee-yoo!"" That was the BEST EVER! I'm glad that George Lucas took the Star Wars universe seriously enough to present this prequel installment that really stays true to the source material. I felt like it was just like watching the original series in some ways. It took me back to moments in the original Star Wars (Episode IV: A New Hope) where old Ben Kenobi kept telling Luke to pull his finger.

7. The movie doesn't waste any time talking about Darth Maul, giving us any detail into his past, showing some insight into his character, or anything else stupid like that. It's like George Lucas already knew from the beginning that nobody would be interested in him.

8. This movie shows Anakin before he became a member of N'Sync. He was pretty awesome too. He built his own droid, built his own podracer, won a pod race, piloted a starfighter, and destroyed a trade federation droid control ship, all before he was 10 years old! Is that not cool or what? That's why I say that this movie is even better than Home Alone 3. I'd like to say that it is just as good as the 1st Home Alone, but it's hard to beat Macaulay Culkin.

9. Some of the acting in this movie is the absolute best. To me, I think it would be kind of difficult to deliver all my lines in a flat monotone, without showing any facial expression whatsoever. But Natalie Portman pulls it off brilliantly! She is to be commended for that.

10. The dialogue is hard to beat, too. We get to hear some nice speeches about midi-chlorians (cool!), and we also get some lines that don't make any sense on the surface, until you start to think about it. (""We are brave, your highness."") And something about a trade blockade and some kind of war and the senators are all a bunch of idiots, and well, I couldn't really figure out the story. All I know is that Jar-Jar Binks rocked!

The only reason I give this movie 4 stars rather than 5 is because it doesn't have any Ewoks in it. Ewoks (taste like Chicken!) would have been an excellent addition, and I think Lucas just missed the boat on that one.",1156723200,15,2913,4.356088560885609
656596,5,6303454038,"Phantom Menace makes no sense if one looks at the surface.  The film has virtually nothing to do at all with the Trade Federation or the invasion of Naboo.  But when one realizes that the conniving and evil Senator Palpatine is orchestrating the whole thing (including a full-scale invasion of his own planet) in order to become Chancellor, destroy the Jedi, and form the first Galactic Empire, then the film becomes a somewhat horrifying and very interesting introduction to the Star Wars saga.  If one looks at the surface, disappointment and confusion ensues.  If one reads between the lines, the story becomes clear (and quite entertaining).  It is no accident that this least-understood of all Star Wars films is entitled ""The PHANTOM Menace.""",1156377600,8,748,5.048780487804878
656597,4,6303454038,"Star Wars purists were a bit put off by The Phantom Menace when it was first released.  But I liked the film and felt that it was a wonderful way to introduce new characters and new generations to the Star Wars universe.  The special effects have finally caught up to George Lucas' visionary imagination, so unlike the first series of films, nothing feels particularly forced or hokie, not even the much maligned Jar Jar Binks.

To be sure, much of The Phantom Menace feels like a live action cartoon.  Still that only adds to the fun of which focuses on the adventures of an adorable and unusually gifted young Anakin Skywalker(Jake Lloyd).  The surprise of this film are the strong female characters, Anakin's mother Shmi, played by the noted Scandinavian actress Pernella August, and the young Queen of the Naboo, the brave Padme played Natalie Portman.  Padme and her character's body double, famously portrayed by Keira Knightley, manage to create interesting personas out of characters who are outrageously overdressed in a variety of elaborate costumes.

Still Lucas' film settles into a series of set pieces which feature two Jedi Knights, Liam Neeson and Ewan MacGregor as the young Obi Wan Kenobi, assigned to rescue and protect a young Queen, who stumble upon a young boy who may or may not be the fulfillment of a great prophecy.  The Queen turns out to be perfectly capable of taking care of herself and her sworn enemies.  The little boy, born a slave on an outer rim world, proves to be much more of a problem.  The hidden enemies include not only the hideous Darth Maul but also a much oilier Sith Lord who masquerades as a sincerely ambitious politician.

Considered within the context of the Star Wars entertainment universe, Phantom Menace serves as an opportunity to rekindle interest in the franchise, introduce new characters and provide substantial back stories for the beloved characters of Obi Wan and Yoda.  On a deeper level, Phantom Menace also restarts the legend of a the holy child, a once and future hero whose fate is to serve as the essential character in a fable about the nature of good and evil.

We already know how one part of the story ends: Anakin's children, particularly his son Luke will help to restore him to the Light side of the Force. What this story fills in are the key elements of the beginning of the tale.  What was there about young Anakin that created such a fatal flaw that the greatest of Jedi Knights would become the monstrous tool of Imperial authority Lord Vader?  To care about that part of the story, we have the genuinely like young Anakin and the other key personalities in the fable. To that end Portman and MacGregor have the most work to do in creating the emotional framework that will center the next two stories.

Lucas, the storyteller, waited a long time to tell us what happened then.  The movie leaves us wanting to find out what happened next.",1155427200,3,2920,4.727810650887574
656598,2,6303454038,"Preface: Oswald Spengler, the most brilliant philosopher who ever lived, would have understood well the cyclical rise and decline of the Star Wars phenomenon, in two respects.

  Firstly, the degradation of the fictional universe created by George Lucas from a spiritually necessary experience to an absurd, farcical shadow of itself, brought about by hubris and a surfeited excess of material wealth, exactly corresponds to the path that every culture must tread down, willingly or no, according to his ""morphology of world history"".

  Secondly, the fact that this movie exists at all in the form it does--its triteness, its gimmicky-ness, its squandering and liquidation of its own good reputation, its absence of human feeling, its lack of any respect for form and proportion, its relentlessly marketed banality--all this is a symptom of the ""panem et circensus"" attitude our own society has fallen into.

  If you want to understand the times we live in, read The Decline of the West, and revel in the sum of all wisdom (if you know what's good for you). And now for the review. . .

  Let me take you back to a long time ago, in a galaxy far away. Actually, the place was here, and the time was only seven years ago, but it might as well be another universe, so much has changed. If you can recall the hype surrounding this movie's original release, then you know what I'm talking about. For months upon months we were bombarded with intimations of the coming kairos, the movie that would make an end of all suffering and death, the fantastic unveiling of the meaning of existence-- Star Wars, Episode One: The Phantom Menace.

  The tension was built up to a frenetic pitch. The cosmic tumblers were all locking into place. The stars had aligned to bring about the transfiguration of human history. Such a blitzkrieg of advertisment-artillary was brought to bear on the public that anyone with a normal threshold for sensory overload was thoroughly exhausted before the first projector even flickered up. And then, the other shoe fell. . .

  The movie blew. To call this the biggest letdown in the history of cinema is far to charitable a description of the cellulosic turd that George Lucas took all over his legacy, not to mention the millions of us who adored his original trilogy. I must say that I fully concur with everthing negative that has been said concerning this movie in the many reviews appearing below. Most of that is so well known by now that it doesn't need to be rehashed by me. From the great midi-chlorian desoulment of The Force to the incomparably awful flop-eared rasta Jar-Jar Binks to the mailed-in performances by otherwise fine actors, yousa knows it all already. The lack of plot and character developement, the vulgar concession to the tastes of an over-entertained, jaded audience, the case goes on and on . . .

  OK, I'll admit that I did have a lot of fun watching this at times. The special effects were truly dazzeling. From the moment I first saw it in the theater, I knew they had to make a pod-racing video game, and I couldn't wait to play it. I was thrilled about the idea of testing my Jedi reflexes on a beautifully designed track, preferably whilst chillin' and illin' with my old buddies. A cold brew and a pod-race throwdown with the homeboyz, what better way to spend a summer's afternoon? There is a lot to be said for experiences like this. Given the pointlessness and ritual-enforced ennui of the modern world, they are probably the closest any of us will get to actual heroism. I can appreciated the joys of raucus male-bonding and the pleasures of detente as much as any flesh-and-blood human being, but they are not the ultimate; I do not give my soul to them. And thus, we get to the point. The original Star Wars movies were so great precisely because they offered us a spiritual release in an otherwise frustrating and meaningless existence. But this movie *caters* to that existence, frankly and unapologetically. The gimmicks are just over the top. The two-headed NASCAR barker at the race track was an espescially sacriligious addition, and did anyone catch the ""Three-Stooges"" spoof performed by the track maintainance droids? Cultural colloquiallisms like these destroy any universal quality the film might have had, and this is unforgiveable, seeing as how Star Wars is supposed to be an epic saga of good vs. evil, not a Voltairian-like, cyncical catalogue of deceased Americana.

  The exposition in the movie is handled just about as horribly as it is possible to do such things. ""Oh, look, on the screen. It's Queen Amidala herself!"" ""Now Anikin, hide here in this cockpit and don't touch anything."" (Gee, I wonder what's going to happen?)The dialogue sounds like it could be best delivered by Stephen Hawking's speech synthesizer. In fact, I'm not sure the movie wouldn't have been better if the entire script had just been written out on the screen on that trademark, invisable word-manifold receding diagonally through space. The pure, plastic actuality of the Star Wars universe (not to mention the score) is gigantic, epic, and gorgeous, and we have George Lucas to thank for that. But who in the name of William-blessed-Faulkner ever told him he could write??

  Some of the reviewers below have made mention of certain racial stereotypes occuring in this film. I think they're playing up this angle too much, but I did notice that the Trade Federation frogs spoke with a vaguely Germanic accent, which tells me that goosshe-shtepping morons like whoever George Lucas has turned into should try developing characters instead of resorting to stock villans. This sort of thing is simply embarrassing.

  To conclude, I would just like to say what a dissappointment this was. I can remember watching ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as a child of about four (I am 25 at the time of this writing). At that age, one's experience of reality is very fluid. It is not possible to distinguish between what your senses actually perceive and what you dream or imagine; it all flows together into a manifold sensoro-spiritual becoming. While I was too young to pay attention for very long or to understand much of anything about the plot, I was definatly overcome by the ""Wow"" of it all. And like many other members of my generation, Star Wars became a treasured element of my inner-worldly mythology. It appears that I must now reconcile myself to the fact that the magic that so astounded me as a child is passing over the historical horizon, not to be scene again in that form. I will show the originals to my own children, and abandon this latter-day effort to the winds.",1154217600,9,6636,4.8211453744493395
656599,4,6303454038,"Episode one did not have as interesting  a storyline  as  episodes 4, 5 & 6.  Impact of the movie was lessened viewing it on a small screen.",1154044800,,140,4.074074074074074
656600,2,6303454038,"It's not fair to compare this 'new' story with the OT, but unfortunately its nearly impossible not to do so.  In trying to put that aside as much as I can, I am firm in my belief that if Lucas had rolled this movie out to introduce us to the world of Star Wars, the world's most recognizable movie franchise would have never gotten off the ground.

No doubt it would have enjoyed some moderate success, but The Phantom Menace is more akin to the uneven efforts of Stargate or Dune than his own earlier work.  And let us remember that if the tremendous, unprecedented success of the original Star Wars (now Episode IV), made those other movies possible.  That's the type of impact it had on Hollywood and popular culture.  This installment is Darth Vader in movie form, a soulless shadow of its former self.

What are the reasons for this?  I will sum up a few.

#1: The Story.  George wrote this one himself, as he did ANH (mostly).  That story was lifted from the Hidden Fortress, as is well known.  Nothing wrong with that.  He took a great story, adapted it, and turned it into gold.  Perhaps Lucas couldn't find another Kurosawa film for inspiration.  More likely, he has forgotten from whence his inspiration came and thought it was all of his own doing.  Not so, and The Phantom Menace demonstrates that.

Some fans might (and do) call this film complex and subtle, I would opt for confused, stilted and often boring.  Is this a movie that employs juvenile fart jokes or a tale of intrigue and deception that introduces a great saga?  Although many have accused George of greed or laziness, a more telling reason for his approach comes from an interview with Lucas' former producer Gary Kurtz. (they parted ways after ESB).  According to Gary, after the runaway success of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Lucas became convinced that the American (read: dumb) movie audience had no appreciation for deep moving stories, and it was only the ""roller-coaster"" ride that mattered.  Thus his complaints at the efforts put into making ESB the best of the SW series, and the cheap and empty thrills of ROTJ and the PT.  The sad thing is, I think he gave us what he really thought we wanted.

#2: Poor direction.  A more competant director would have eeked out something better from the weak script. George did an adequate job with the original because it was a pretty straight forward linear plot with very defined roles of good and evil.  The 'muddiness' of TPM highlights Lucas' weaknesses, which include nuance and emotion, oh, and dialouge.  That BOTH the script and the direction suffer from the same weakness is like marrying your cousin.  The result ain't pretty.

He got lousy performances from Ewan, Natalie, Samuel freakin' Jackson. To turn Oscar-worthy actors into cyborgs takes some pretty substantial anti-talent.  He has apparently not grown much since his ""faster and more intense"" days.  Poor Jake suffered the most at Lucas' ham-fisted directing sensibilities, but everyone is force to muddle through his ""no one in the history of ANY galaxy has ever talked like this"" dialouge.  Liam Neeson proved his mettle by being the only human in the bunch.

It is NO COINCIDENCE that the movie Lucas had the LEAST control over turned out to the best one.  He needs to stick to the FX unit or editing room.

It seems the most positive words have been for the technical aspects of the movie: sound, visuals, special effects, etc.  While dutifully impressed, I too often felt that the story and characters were upstaged by CG that served no purpose other than to be CG.  They all scream ""HEY LOOK AT ME, I'M WAY COOL!  HOW DID THEY MAKE ME?""  The captivating answer?  They drew it on the computer, then colored it in.  YIPPEE.

All that said, if you are able to mentally mute the ridiculous Jar-Jar and forgive Jake Lloyd, The Phantom Menace turns out to be the most watchable (or least offensive) of the PT movies.  Ian McDiarmind is perfectly weasely, and the 3-way lightsaber duel was the best of any of the 6, despite the weak ending. The Phantom Menace is a small story told against a much larger background that's out there waiting for us to discover it. The film holds out the hope that there will be better, larger stories to be told in this universe.  Too bad we have to wait until Episode IV for that to happen.",1154044800,5,4317,4.633728590250329
656601,1,6303454038,"The prequel trilogy begins it's legacy of contradicting the original with a bang. Jar-Jar Binks and poop jokes abound, it only proves to show that Star Wars has no idea who they're target audiance is. Two movies later, the main character will be killing children, will lose all of his limbs and have the flesh burnt from his body.

It's a non-stop parade of characters from the original trilogy because this movie simply cannot stand on it's own. The acting, dialogue, editing, and plot are terrible beyond words. The movie is filler, and nothing else. They wanted to show Anakin joining the Jedi Order and he didn't do anything important until he was a Jedi Knight. Rather than skip ahead ten years he decided to waste our time with trade routes, a half-baked droid army scheme, ""slap stick"" antics and a constant barrage of puns.",1153699200,6,831,4.731034482758621
656602,1,6303454038,"I first saw this movie while it was in theaters in 1999 when I was only 12 years old.  I had yet to gain respect for the original three for their superb acting, cast, story, atmosphere and special effects and while watching this film through my adolescent mind, I thought it was an excellent action movie.  The reason I perceived it to be good is because that is the age level that Lucas was aiming for.  It is obvious that Lucas was going to make a fortune off the next three prequels and it appears that he decided to screw the fans of star wars and cash in on a mediocre piece of garbage.  Now that I am somewhat older, there is no hiding just how utterly awful this and the next two films are.

The acting in this movie can be compared to the power rangers who have ODed on Ritalin.  No life, no enthusiasm, no sense of the actors really even tiring to put any effort onto the screen.  They just seem to be going through the motions all in a monotone voice, and those are the non-CGI characters (the jokes sucked to say the least).  Also, with the introduction of Jar Jar, Lucas apparently wanted to make episode 1 as big of a disappointment as possible; how could someone in their right mind insert such mindless character?  The only comic relief that Jar Jar will bring is to those under 10 years of age - a real slap in the face to Star Wars fans.  On another note, the droids in this movie didn't have any kind of evil, dangerous feel to them like the storm troopers had.

The plot... humm.  Lucas has gone with the flow of most action films lately, in that there is practically no plot.  Since this is the first star wars film in the series, there should have taken it easy for us to introduce all the characters and let us learn more about their personalities.  Everything is rushed; we get no breaks at all in this movie, just constant action.  The Pod race scene wasn't even necessary; it provided nothing for the story and was only inserted for filler, 20 minutes of filler.

The only this that was remotely positive about this film were the special effects which were still somewhat of a let down, not in it's authenticity of realism, but everything looked super high tech and clean.  Lucas should have tried to keep the 1970 grungy technology feel to everything like the original star wars, which would have helped in really feel like a prequel

I am harsh on this movie because of just how well made the original three Star Wars turned out and the high standards they accomplished.  Although a somewhat entertaining popcorn flick, I can not enjoy it because of the injustice it does to the original three.  It doesn't deserve to belong to the Star Wars legacy.",1152662400,5,2676,4.400406504065041

656687,3,6303454038,"The Phantom Menace was probably one of the most anticipated movies of all time, and ended up disappointing a lot of folks.  The DVD release has fared better.  The DVD contains lots of special features that describe the technical, human, and creative work that went into creating Episode I.  In doing so, this DVD has set the foundation by which all newer DVD releases are measured; how completely do the special features describe the movie and all the thought and work that went into making and advertising it.  Ignoring the movie itself, there are several features of the DVD that could have been improved.  First, the extra and deleted scenes should have been incorporated into the movie itself, or the DVD should have come with an option whereby the viewer can watch the movie with or without these extra scenes.  Second, for a movie advertised throughout the world, the DVD should have came with subtitles in more languages.  Third, it would have been nice for the DVD to include a special feature that breaks down the cost of making this movie.

Now to the movie itself.

1. The music was good but not great.  Too much of the music was a rehash from the first (last) three movies.

2. The acting was wooden in many places.  More specifically, there was not enough of it.  The movie was essentially dictacted by action scenes, when it should have been a movie about relationships.  For example, the relationship between Anakin and Qui Gon Jin should have been expanded into a central part of the story, such that the death of the latter would be the first of many scars on Anakin's psyche that would eventually turn him to the dark side.  This is also another failing of the movie; it shows no emotional connection between the death of Qui Gon and Anakin.

3.  For a movie franchise that has so many female fans, it would have been nice to have had more female lead characters.  One example would have been to make Qui Gon Jin's character a woman.  We don't see a major female Jedi knight in any of the six movies.  Imagine that; Anakin leaves his mother and comes under the care of a foster mother - who later dies in battle and emotionally scars Anakin.  This in turn would set up the loss of his real mom in Episode II and his wife in Episode III.

4. Why do so many of the alien races talk in English; especially in English that sounds like that spoken by foreign immigrants to the USA?  Watto and Sebulba were the two most believable alien characters for me in this movie; and they both spoke in different tongues.

5. The podrace scene was astounding.  It gets my vote for the greatest race scene ever.

6. There should have been more development of Darth Maul's character and the origins of the Sith lords.  Being Episode I, there needs to be more backstory to such a complex galaxy that Lucas has created.

7. Part of the mystery and mystique of the first (last) three episodes are the surprises it pulls; Vader being Luke's dad, Leia being Luke's sister, the trap Palpatine lays for the rebels on Endor, etc...  This is totally absent in The Phantom Menace.  Most importantly, the character of Palpatine and Darth Sidious are given away immediately.  And Palpatine's head of the Galactic Senate is a total giveaway for his eventual dictatorship.  A more clever and interesting way would be keep Palpatine's character on the side and less powerful until the very end (Episode III).

8. Why didn't the Jedi go to rescue Anakin's mom from slavery at the end of Episode I and bring her somewhere safer or at least closer to Anakin?  Or for that matter why didn't the Jedi knights free her from Watto?  Slavery was illegal and there would have been nothing Watto could have done to keep Shmi if the Jedi Knights took her...

All in all a good movie and a good DVD, but neither are great.",1148860800,2,3795,4.545722713864307
656688,2,6303454038,"Kids willl love everything about this movie: Jar Jar, the semi-interesting villian Darth Maul, the lightsabers, the podrace. They might not get the unneccesarily complicated plot, but they won't care either. Adults and teens will be forced to take a different view.

The greatest thing that can be said for this movie is that it's usually fun to look at. Take the podrace sequence, for example. It's extremely realistic, especially for it's time.

Then it drags on for twenty minutes. That's just too much, especially when the average race feels long at five minutes, in a movie.

Unfortunately, most of the acting is terrible as well. Ewan McGregor is the most talented moment of the cast, but he barely does anything. The main problem with the acting is actually the dialogue. Liam Neeson might be good if we could except that normal people actually said truly bizarre things like the stuff coming out of his mouth. But we can't, and the don't.

Then there's Jar Jar. Oh, Jar Jar. Possibly the most despised character in reccent years, including villians. This character makes fart jokes. Yes, my friends, you heard me correctly: Star Wars now has fart jokes.

However, visually and in terms of special effects, this is a revolutionary movie. The planet of Naboo features some of the most beautiful scenes, and an underwater sequence is especially spectacular. The lightsaber fights are fun, but unfortunately it's impossible to care about the villian too much--he's no Darth Vader. Speaking of which, it's hard to believe that little Jake Lloyd's Anakin, who jumps aroud saying ""Yippee!"" and ""Mom, you said most of the problems in the galaxy are cause people don't help each other"" will really grow up to be the most loved-hated villian ever? Because I don't.

If all you want is visual spectacle, or something that can be watched on really boring evenings with a bowl of popcorn, buy this. If you're new to SW, stick with the Empire Strikes back, or just go with something more substantial than the unfortunate mess that is ""The Phantom Menace.""",1146873600,,2049,4.890489913544669
656689,4,6303454038,"This movie is actually pretty good - it was amazing to see how the jedi were during their prime! The lightsaber sequences were just amazing, and like nothing that we saw in the previous trilogy. The story was interesting, for the most part, and of course, the special effects were spectacular.

Now for the bad: too much jar jar. Lucas needed to tone him down a bit. He was far too overbearing in this flick and his comedic relief was really not comedic, and really no relief! The acting in this one definitely needed work, but I think the problem was related more to Lucas' awkward dialogue and not a reflection of the actors themselves.

Overall, I can get past those issues. The new movies certainly lack the charm and emotions of the original trilogy, but they are still superior to most sci fi films that are out there.

One more thing - I keep reading how people felt that this movie was racist. I suppose that if you are looking to be offended, you will find 'racism' everywhere, even in a star wars movie.",1146182400,3,1013,4.464864864864865

If boring wasn't enough... what's with the overt rascism in the characters... is this really a Star Wars episode?! George, are you still doing acid or are you just having flashbacks?

If no stars was an option that what I would have rated this film!!!!!!!!",1145750400,3,421,4.397435897435898
656781,2,6303454038,"Like most Star Wars fans, I literally counted down the days until this was released. Then, on opening day, I saw it. And all the magic I experienced as a kid was gone. Sure it has great visual fx, but my God! The story was horrible! The Trade Federation is blockading the planet of Naboo? Huh?! What the hell does that mean? How many kids are going to understand that? At least in the original trilogy the story was easy to comprehend. An evil empire. A big, bad Death Star that can destroy entire planets. A princess that needs rescuing. It was simple, but it worked. With this new trilogy, George Lucas seemed to think that computer fx was all he needed to make a great movie. The story, obviously was secondary. As was the acting. I swear, there were times I literally cringed when certain dialogue was spoken. Ok, enough of that. It did have a few good things to offer us ""old fans"", but not enough to give this even a 3 star rating. Here is where I think the film succeeded and where it failed.

The good:

1) The visual fx. Wow. The film sure looks good. The vehicles, the digital characters. It sure makes the fx in the first trilogy look antique.

2) The pod race. Holy crap! The was ten times more exciting than the speeder bike race in ""Return of the Jedi"".

3) Darth Maul. Need I say more?

4) The lightsaber battles. Finally we get to see what the Jedi (and the Sith) are really capable of.

5) The origin of C-3PO. So, Vader/Anakin made him huh? Cool!

6) R2-D2. As usual, he pulls everybody's fat out of the fire.

Now, the bad:

1) The acting. Ugh! Awful. It looks as if everybody learned their lines five minutes before they went in front of the camera. Natalie Portman is especially bad here. Sorry, but it's true. Her acting is horrible.

2) Yoda. While it's great to see the old Jedi Master again, he doesn't look like the Yoda we remember. He looks...well, I'm not sure. But does have fat lips. And a strange head.

3) The story. As stated earlier, it's too confusing and many times just makes no sense. Why would the Trade Federation blockade Naboo of all planets. And why would the senate condone it? The whole story just seemed forced.

4) Anakin. Boy, is he annoying.

5) Jar Jar Binks. He's the worst one of them all. He's a very stupid, annoying and just plain dumb character. He's not funny. He adds nothing to the story. Sure, the film needed some humor, but not like this! Lucas may as well have put digital versions of the Three Stooges in here!

Okay, I've been a little harsh, but I was expecting so much more from George Lucas. It was fun at times, but overall, it actually embarrassed me. Sorry, but that's the truth.",1143417600,4,2651,4.361788617886178
656782,5,6303454038,"I would order this again, i really enjoyed star wars.",1142899200,3,53,4.4
656783,3,6303454038,"I was deeply dissappointed in Episode I because it does not even come close to the high quality of the legendary originals. There are many reasons for this, and one of the main reasons is the dumbing down of the Star Wars saga with childish elements such as the Barney-like Jar-Jar Binks which was an obvious attempt to draw in the younger crowd, thus increase gross revenue through mass-marketed merchandise, etc.

Another reason why Episode I is a far cry from its predecessors is the extreme over-use of computer animation, which is supposed to compliment the movie and not replace the plot and character development that made the first 3 movies unforgettable. To me the puppets and costumes in the original felt far more real than any of the computer animation seen in the new movies.  The puppets made the story feel way more believable than computer animated aliens and robots. Don't get me wrong, I think digital effects can be great if used properly, but it shouldn't be the main ingredient in the recipe of movie making.

Episode I lacked continuity and character development, which are major flaws that can't be ignored. It's a shame that Episode I was geared towards the younger generation and ignored the mature generation that the originals appealed to.

One of the biggest problems with the movie is that it debunks the mythos surrounding the force by explaining it as some type of biological entities in the bloodstream by the name of midichlorians.  In one line delivered by Liam Neeson's character Qui-Gon Jinn, George Lucas who wrote the script single handedly destroyed the mystique that is the force, ironically a concept that he came up with originally nearly 3 decades ago.  Apparently Lucas forgot that part of what makes the original trilogy so special is that the force is an unknown, mysterious power that can be used for good or evil.  The fact that it is clouded in mystery and only a select few can tap into it is what made the concept so appealing, fostering imagination and dreams.  Lucas must have forgotten that this is Star Wars, not Star Trek, where the former is all about flights of fancy and mythology while the latter is more science oriented.

Continuity was a major problem in Episode I, with sporadic jumps from scene to scene thereby breaking up any kind of depth to any of the characters, let alone allowing the story itself to develop.  Darth Maul in particular was perhaps the biggest disappointment since he had so much potential to be the next Darth Vader, or at least a villain close to Vader's status.  No such luck, he was as two-dimensional as they come, with no presence, no dialogue and barely any screen presence except the very end, and he dies before we have any idea of what his story was, or what kind of a character he was besides being ""evil"".  Even Qui-Gon Jinn was a let down, despite the fact that he was a very interesting character.  It's a paradox because the audience is given just a tiny bit of information about him, enough for people to like him, but no exposition to further his characteristics, it was minimal at best, so we are left with another intriguing character with a great deal of potential who was killed before we got a chance to really know him.

Some scenes seemed to be superfluous such as the underwater part where Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan, and Jar-Jar Binks are inside a submarine vehicle, and they end up getting chased by a huge fish, which is swallowed by a bigger fish, and that fish is swallowed by an even bigger fish.  At that point I was convinced that Lucas had run out of good ideas for this film.

The dialogue was wooden at best, with hardly any chemistry between any of the characters, except for Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan.  Lucas seriously should have left the script writing up to far more talented screen writers.

The excessive use of CGI has become Lucas' crutch, mistakenly believing that it can replace a solid story, deep characters and real sets.  It would have been so much better had Lucas used less computer animation and more props, costumes, puppets and animatronics, all of which have evolved a great deal in the past 3 decades and could have been put to much better use.  Less CGI please and more story, Lucas.

Despite its flaws, the movie is interesting because it explains Anakin's origins, and some of the space battles as well as the Jedi lightsaber duels are truly impressive which redeem this film from being below average.",1142640000,3,4439,4.701935483870968

656862,4,6303454038,"JUST WHAT IS THE PHANTOM MENACE?: [plot spoilers BELOW]

The ""Phantom Menace"" opens with Obi-Wan Kenobi [Ewan McGregor] as a young apprentice Jedi. Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) is his very stable mentor. Anakin Skywalker [Jake Lloyd], the future father of Luke Skywalker who will become the evil Darth Vader, is just a 9-year-old boy. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are assigned to settle the matter of the Trade Federation cutting off all access routes to the planet Naboo. Somehow the Trade Federation seems to think they have a legal right to do this. However, when the Jedi's arrive on the Trade Federations vessel for peaceful negotiation, they are immediately attacked and marked for death. Switching to plan B, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan escort Queen Amidala [Natalie Portman] from Naboo to a meeting of the Republic's leaders in Coruscant, but mechanical problems with their spaceship force them to land on the planet Tatooine. Here, Qui-Gon meets Anakin who has been living with his mother as the slave of a salvage dealer. Believing that Anakin could be the leader the Jedis have been searching for, Qui-Gon attempts to bargain with the Salvage Dealer for Anakin's freedom. Naturally, Qui-Gon plans to get permission from the Jedi counsel to instruct Anakin about the ""The Force"", with aims at making him a Jedi and the ultimate savior of the galaxy. All of this comes to a climax during the pod race which settles the issue of Anakin's freedom and gets Qui-Gon the spare parts he needs to repair his ship. This allows the Jedis to continue on their voyage to transport the Queen and bring Anakin to the Jedi Counsel to seek their approval for his training.

BUT THAT'S NOT ALL:

Of course, things don't go exactly like they are supposed to and there are many obstacles to be overcome. Many still exist at the film's conclusion. Some characters are notably absent and some are killed off, much to my chagrin, but it is, after all, something that happened long ago and far away! This is okay, because there are two more prequels to follow and settle these issues and, most of all, to illustrate Anakin's rise and ultimate fall to the ""Dark Side of The Force"".

IS THIS A WORTHY ADDITION TO THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE?

Star Wars is a tough act to follow - pure and simple. So what could be more difficult than creating a prequel trilogy for the most celebrated film trilogy in history? Add to that, high space fantasy, huge expectations, and the lack of plot resolutions in each individual segment of the prequel trilogy, and you're looking at a tall order before one even looks at the technology and budget needed to do this thing right. To achieve the ultimate goal of this film -- which is to tie together the original trilogy with the convulsive elements that caused the ""STAR WARS"" in the first place -- is impossible until the prequel trilogy is complete. Now in 2006, having had the opportunity to see the prequel trilogy in its entirety, this opening segment [The Phantom Menace] feels and plays much better than it did before the trilogy was completed. The effects are wonderful and very real, the dialogue, never a strong point, still isn't, but the story and the spectacle do get told. As a piece of a 5-star, 6-film saga, this is a worthy component.

A neat film and an even neater DVD with very interesting features. Well worth seeing, but, ""THE REVENGE OF THE SITH"" held my attention and interest much tighter throughout the entire film.",1139702400,,3436,4.756711409395973
656863,4,6303454038,"I really llike Star Wars, and this movie was no exception, but why did there have to be so much Jar Jar?! Yeah, yeah, he was sort of revalant to the plot, but as one of my friends said, ""Less Jar Jar, more Maul!!!"" he has a point. There aren't a whole lot of lightsaber fights with the jedi in this episode. The pod racing and whatever duels there were in the movie were exciting, but it was a bit more talky than episodes II- VI. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent movie and has a place on your shelf, but episodes IV, V, and VI should be there too.

To fill the gigantic shoes that fans created for it? True, the characters in this particular installment are, as yet, ill-defined.  True, the action seems designed more to distract from the story than to move it along.  And true, there is a near constant tug-of-war within the film between Anakin Skywalker and Jar-jar Binks as to whom can be the most annoying.  But does any of this make this a bad movie? Or is it just the fact that it's not the Star Wars that we remember as kids, the phenomenon that sparked imaginations, changed lives, and shaped the future of movies to come? It's a bummer, but you can't go back to the way things were.  And if you can suspend your own expectations for a minute, turn off all the comparisons, and just enjoy a good old-fashioned movie (not an exercise in intellectual stimulation, I mean a MOVIE.  Something you just let pass through your eyes and smack into your brain, with a minimum of interference), well then this is as good a movie as any.  It's not the same as the original, but then, is anything?",1139011200,2,1172,4.47887323943662
656866,3,6303454038,"After Star Wars opened, George Lucas knew he had a hit and started planning two sequels.  After Empire Strikes Back, he started thinking about three prequels and possibly three additional sequels.

The Phantom Menace is the first prequel.  This film is like The Empire Strikes back.  It is here to set up the story.  We meet all the characters talked about in the original trilogy.

Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) is a Jedi master whose apprentice is Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor).  They are escorting Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) when their ship crash lands in on Tatooine.  There they come across a young boy Anakin Skywalker.  Anakin has great skills. Obi Wan sees it and frees the boy as his apprentice.

The rest of the film is used to set up the two films to follow.

The problem with prequels is they are limited in what can happen.  The ending must support the original film.  Therefore, we know what must happen to many of the lead characters.  The plus is that some important scenes that are only referred to can be fully fleshed out.

The failure of this film is that the special effects are more important the story.

This is a beautifully made film but it is like an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.  At the end you are whistling the sets.

Ewan McGregor proves why he is one of the most sought after actors.  He shows many facets to Obi Wan.  The rest of the cast is fine in what they are given.

This is a must own for a Star Wars fanatic, a must see for a Star Wars fan and a must miss for those who prefer films by Kubrick, Kurosawa or Truffaut.  I fit in the second but want the first three because I love the second three.

The droids are enemies of the Republic, who want to change it and take it over; thereby, enslaving its inhabitants.

I rate this movie only 4 stars because the plot is somewhat lackluster, and the movie isn't long enough.

However, on a positive note, while the plot is relatively simplistic and short, the special effects and the characters are both memorable and excellent.

Bottom-line: The actors did a great job acting, but the movie needed a more complex plot and needed to be longer. Instead, it's rather short and leaves you wanting more excitement and adventure.

The main failings are the same as any series when you step back in time.  A lot of footage is used to establish characters that show up later rather than simply using different characters, and the film does not completely mesh with the first one produced (which I guess is now number 4).  The young Luke Skywalker seems to be on intimate terms with droids and others that he seems to meet up with later for the first time (???).  The late C.S. Forester was probably the last writer who stepped back in a character's life (with Horatio Hornblower) and successfully meshed stories.

Putting the above points aside, the film would do pretty well standing on its own feet.  We have an evil force trying to use others to do its wishes by promising them great rewards.  We have heroes and heroines saving the day.  We have a living-happy-ever-after type ending.  There seems to be no romantic interest, e.g., Luke is too young, the Jedi Knights appear to be from a monestary, etc.  There is the usual assortment of ETs to add to the entertainment value.",1136246400,,1202,4.591549295774648

It certainly impresses with all of its spectacle.  But by today we would have mostly forgotten about it.  There is almost nothing engaging in this story.  Adventure stories always follow a hero through a quest.  This story is aimless, due partly to its backstory nature.  There is no main viewpoint character who we experience the story through.  There is no central quest for a hero and villian to grapple over.  Even the real villain of the film is a ""Phantom.""  The child, Anakin Skywalker, who is supposed to be the central character has no drive, no personality, no motivation.  And he's blessed with the best case of good luck in the galaxy.  When have you ever heard a good story in which the hero destroys the villain's army completely by accident?  From a stuctural standpoint, the film feels like the director is simply connecting dots without infusing any soul into the story.  And the humor is downright insulting for anything other than the silliest of childrens films.

The long wait between 1983 and 1999 was indeed a long one. Sure there were novels and comic books in the meantime but they weren't Star Wars. Not really. But Episode I was certainly worth the wait!

Most people would assume with Episode I that Lucas wouldv'e started small and then built things up throughout his trilogy but instead he started BIG with a capitol B and he ended EPIC with his Episode III.

Episode I was smart, fun and fast paced. Sure the more nuerotic moviegoers let a silly character like Jar Jar ruin their experience but the more hardcore fans saw and appreciated what Lucas was doing-starting the series light and then growing darker as it progresses. It paid off big time!

In the end we got a movie that was worthy of the reputation of the Original Trilogy and we got a new trilogy that bettered what came before it!

He could have been an enjoyable comic relief character, but instead he was just intolerably irritating.
Then there is the pod race, a scene which got a lot more focus than necessary, which left me feeling like Lucas just wanted to throw in something to take up time.

657008,1,6303454038,"""Uh-Oh.""

About 5 minutes into George Lucas's monstrous, reeking, python-thick digital floater ""The Phantom Menace""---which managed to take a merciless dump on about 20 years of fan excitement and goodwill in just the first 20-minutes of running time alone (that's a year of goodwill p*ssed down the toilet a minute, for the mathematically inclined)---5 minutes in, that's what I said to myself.

""Uh-Oh.""

Here we have the produce two decades in the making: Jar-Jar, Midchlorians (the Force turns out to be a parasite!---so why doesn't the Empire just innoculate against it?), a cheap-looking digital critter vomited forth every second for the ADD crowd, two-headed sports commentators at a Tatooine NASCAR gig, and best of all, just what I know you came for---a trade war. Yeah.

Uh-oh, indeed.

So a long, long time ago, in a Galaxy far away, we are told, a young boy, a promising child, steeped in the ways of the Force though ignorant of his destiny, was born to a slave-mother on a backwater desert world.

Now: imagine it is 1998. Imagine yourself flush with excitement, coming down off the adrenaline rush of seeing the then merely-remastered (and slightly tinkered-with) original trilogy making a triumphal theatrical run. Imagine the fever-dream of possibilities: the arid, dream-killing landscape of Tatooine, the nascent, frightening power of a small boy, a Power that could still be turned to the Force, should only his Jedi minders find him before the Forces of the Sith did.

Imagine the coming of the Darkness; the lengthening of the Shadow. Imagine what ""The Phantom Menace""---promisingly, pulpily titled---could have delivered.

Then cry in Despair, O Prince, to see what atrocity shambled forth, weep bitter tears in the bleak, cold, hard face of What Might Have Been, gaze upon what issued forth from Lucas's gaping maw to strut and fret its hour upon the Stage. But mainly to Fret.

So take what the fans want: blackhearted, dastardly Sith villains, including the war-faced Darth Maul; epic light saber duels between the frantic Jedi and their Sith adversaries; and hopefully a close-encounter with the brooding child who would grow up to stalk the gantry stations of many a cringing Rebel base as Darth Vader.

What did Lucas serve up: he gave Darth Maul perhaps 3 seconds of screen time, flushed him down the cinematic equivalent of a commode (sliced neatly in half, no less, just when the movie had ratcheted up some dramatic tension), and devoted the rest to Jar-Jar Binks, and his entire misbegotten race of pseudo-Rastafarian gob-stopper slinging toads. After Phantom Menace, I gained a newfound appreciation for the Imperial ""Humans Only"" rule.

Oh, and there's Jake Lloyd as Little Darth. Who amongs us can forget Jake Lloyd?

Yes---some would counter, rightly, that Lucas offered us something new in the realm of digital effects. But special effects should *accentuate* the drama, not supplant it.

Aside from a nice, dramatic soundtrack (starved by the utter absence of anything approaching dramatic tension or pacing in the film), this is sound and fury, signifying nothing.

657009,2,6303454038,"For Adults: one star:

The Phantom Menace is filled with cartoonish graphics (purple bouncing balls as weapons, fake looking locations and space battles straight out of a playstation game) which make the film appear confused in its origins - is it a cartoon or a film?

The film is devoid of substance of any kind, and its cynical idea that the bigger the better does not hold up. Its redeeming features are eliminated - Darth Maul, Liam Neeson, and the little kid is annoying with his 'yippeee!' dialogue.

Why is Yoda cross-eyed?

In a cinematic world that brings in subtle well-paced special effects such as in Lord of the Rings  - which has real locations that give it scope and size - TPM looks closed in and stuffy in comparison - with stiff walk-in-from the-left and exit-on-the-right character direction usually seen on a substandard theatrical play.

...and the dialogue will make you burn up with embarrassment.

For Kids: four stars:

This film is filled with action packed sequences that will amaze you. It has funny moments involving favourites R2D2 and Jar Jar Binks. Though the background plot may seem too complex for younger viewers (it is, after all, about 'tax' - yippee!) there is enough sequences that will amaze - such as the pod race.

At the end of the day, this is a kids film. Whether this is the right direction for a 30 year old saga or not remains to be seen - but nevertheless kids will love this film.

 An even longer time ago in a galaxy (that seems to have infinite planets); we witness the beginning of the collapse of a democracy and the rise of an empire, in addition to, the development of a villain of legendary proportions.

 Unfortunately, the movie stands on special effects. The story has stuff that is never explained in the rest of the series, and what is explained sounds too Eastern Religion.

 Unfortuetly childish creatures come again in the form of big talking frogs. Again trying to appeal to children.

 Although the actors were very good, the writing they were given was bad. George Lucas wrote it himself, big mistake.

 Overall, the movie suffers from bad writing and another childish creature. The special effects are the only thing holding the story together; also, it spends too much time dilly-dallying around exotic environments. The worst out of the Star Wars 3/5 Stars.

657125,5,6303454038,"I don't understand why fans always seem to cut down this movie as much as they do. I have been a fan for many years and have never had a problem with this film at all. In fact, I've seen this movie many times, last time was two days ago, and the movie is as fresh as it was when I saw it the first day in theaters. The story really has matured and has taken on a serious storyline. Anakin turning evil after all is a serious topic.

The movie is very well done with incredible special effects, the CGI characters do not bother me at all and I feel you can get more emotion out of a CGI character than you can with a puppet any day. Those who deny this are just fooling themselves. Could you imagine them trying to flap Watto's wings if he were a muppet? He never would have flown if he were because it would have been very difficult to do. I praise the decision to use CGI in this film; some scenes are very beautiful because of it.

The storyline is great. I loved the new characters; I don't think we will ever forget about Darth Maul and Qui-Gon, both very interesting characters.

The musical score to this film is the best. ""Duel of the Fates"", the song it plays when Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are fighting Maul, is one of the best original pieces of music I have heard in years.

Overall, this film is underrated and will gain more respect as the years go by. It's worth seeing by all. Why I say that the DVD version is better is that it has more scenes in the movie that aren't on the VHS version for some reason. So to get more out of the movie, it's better to go with the DVD, not to mention all of the bonus features which are always excellent",1130544000,3,1647,4.089783281733746
657126,1,6303454038,"I'm not sure when it was.. 10 minutes in, 20.. when the creeping, utterly unwanted thought came into my head the first time I watched this film - ""oh no.. it's really, really BAD.""

Fair enough, few films could meet the hype and expectations that THIS one had, but it must have took some considerable skill to screw it up THIS much. As a bog-standard sci-fi adventure, it's average. Looks mighty nice, sure, but there's nothing there. The one promising character (Darth Maul) is in it for about four minutes, and the rest are bland cardboard cut-outs - all except one, which we'll get to later. As a Star Wars movie, which gave us Han Solo, Boba Fett, the Death Star, Jabba, Darth Vader, speeder bikes and countless other iconic moments which are engrained on a whole generations minds - it's borderline criminal.

There is none of the flair of the first movies, no witty one-liners, no quoteable moments - and absolutely ZERO chemistry between any of the characters. For what it could have been, and for what has went before it, it really could be one of the worst films ever made.

One of the main characters who helps this film garner that accolade? Step forward Jar Jar Binks. Was he supposed to be funny? Loveable? I don't know - because every time I see him I want to hurt kittens. Every time I hear him I want to shoot puppies. The most loathsome, teeth-nashingly AWFUL character in the history of movies, he nontheless takes up CHUNKS of movie time - falling over! Talking in a stupid voice! Stepping in dung! You'll laugh till you slit your wrists.

I guess this is what happens when you become TOO powerful. George Lucas seriously needed someone to whisper into his ear, ""you know, George.. maybe we need a drastic re-think, here"".

But alas, that wasn't to be. So we have the turgid first part, the arguably worse second part and the good third part, before we can get onto the REAL Star Wars movies.

Because this? It's worse than the Holiday Special (and if you don't know what THAT is - you've missed a treat....)

657247,4,6303454038,"I am a huge Star Wars fan. I remember seeing the original Star Wars, now called Episode IV: A New Hope, back when it was first released back in 1977. I have collected the toys, read the books, have the posters, etc, etc. Like I said a huge Star Wars fan. So, when I heard that George Lucas was making a prequel trilogy I was very excited and I looked forward to the moment that I could once again see a Star Wars film on the big screen. Well when that day came in May of 1999 I was at the first showing and could not get the grin off my face when the 20th Century Fox logo and theme came on the screen. And when that classic line popped up on the screen ""A long time ago in a galaxy far far away..."" I knew that this was for real. Star Wars was back, but it was different.

I didn't expect the new film to be as good as the original Trilogy, but I still had hopes. While The Phantom Menace was entertaining and full of the great lightsaber fights and space battles we have come to love, it was missing something. I have never expected Oscar caliber acting from these films, but I have to say that some of the performances were just awful. But most of that can be attributed to the script these actors were working from. I have heard a lot of people claim that these films were not meant for everyone and that they were intended for kids. You are fooling yourselves. These films are supposed to be for everyone, for families. And the PG-13 rating for Episode III has shown us that Lucas has not meant for these to be just for children. Don't let the marketing of toys and cereal fool you into thinking these are kids movies.

My main problem with the Phantom Menace is the introduction of Jar Jar Binks. I know a lot of people feel this is a racist character that pokes fun at black people. Well I am black and I don't find the character offensive I just think it is stupid and annoying. I also think Jar Jar takes away from the film and I think Lucas realized that which would explain his dwindling screen time over the next two films. Also Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker was a poor casting choice. As we have seen with such child stars as Haley Joel Osment and Dakota Fanning, children can act and Lucas could have picked a better young boy to play this role. In fact on this DVD there is a bonus feature that shows the casting for Anakin and there were obviously better actors that did not get this role. But as any fan of Star Wars has eventually realized, we will never know what goes on in Lucas' head.

But in spite of all of that, Episode I is still an entertaining film and I really loved the newest villian Darth Maul and the introduction of the double bladed lightsaber. I almost had an accident in my pants when I first saw him ignite the second blade on his lightsaber. He is a great addition to the Star Wars universe and the fights scenes in this film are incredible. Also let me add that yet again John Williams proves that he is the master of movie soundtracks. Star Wars films wouldn't be the same if not for John Williams' music. Duel of the Fates is one of the best pieces of music from all of the films and a music video is included on one of the discs.

Despite this being the worst film of all six films, this two DVD set is still a must have for every collection and adds much to the story and gives us insight into why Darth Vader turned to the dark side. Lucas really put a lot into this DVD set and it shows. From the menus to all of the bonus materials this is a loaded DVD.

Right of the bat, I will agree, yes, Jar Jar Binks was a rather annoying character, but not nearly as bad as the Ewoks in RETURN OF THE JEDI.  I remember one of the main criticisms of this movie was that it was nothing like the original trilogy.  OF COURSE IT WASN'T!!!  This is all supposed to be 30 years earlier!  It's supposed to be an all-new film!

Next there was the issue of the confusing polititcal storyline.  Well, what else did you expect?  The rising of any Empire is likely to always start with a political conflict.  We're introduced to that with the Trade Federation boycott of the planet Naboo and slowly learn that Senator Palpatine is secretly a Sith Lord who has been planning his takeover of the galaxy for a long time.  If all of this is too complicated for the average viewer, then keep watching it until you get it!

Die hard fans with nothing better to do will continue to unfairly bash Episodes I, II and III.  As time goes on, though, they'll probably improve with age because there will be no more films (at least not while George Lucas is alive).

For the record, I AM hoping that someday, after George is no longer with us, 20th Century Fox will commission some new, young, imaginative director to make Episodes VII, VIII and IX, with an all new cast playing Luke, Leia and Han.

I kind of half-seriously said ""if I think that I could've done a better job"". Such is the case here. If I directed this, I would've changed many of the pacing issues, story concerns, and you guessed it, got rid of Jar Jar completely. But I can't so we have this, a film that could've been way much more.

Without getting too much into the plot, basic idea is that the Trade Federation set up a blockade of a nice little planet called Naboo. 2 Jedi are sent as negotiators(or peacemakers, either one) but as usual, things don't go as planned. The 2 Jedi end up encountering Anakin Skywalker, a surprisingly skilled pilot and even a capable Jedi.

The pacing is extremely off with the film. Which would make sense since this is the first of a six film saga so it has to set up characters and situations but even A New Hope, the first of one trilogy had better pacing than this. It's literally one action scene than nothing, a really quick action scene, a long lot of nothing, big scene(Podrace naturally) then nothing until the end where you got 4(!) events going on at once.

Of course the big issue with the film was Jar Jar. Extremely irritating, not funny and overdone. You could take him out and it would be a manageable film. With him in it, it's just, ugh. And surprisingly Darth Flannel, I mean George Lucas doesn't even apologize for the guy. He thinks he's good? Bah.

But it's Star Wars and you can always count on action scenes and there's 2 that make the film: the podrace, where Anakin shows off his skills in a fast-as-hell race through desert and canyon terrain. And the lightsaber duel between our 2 Jedi good guys and the film's ""villain"". One issue I have with the duel however is that the moves look chereographed. Watching the duel between Luke and Darth Vader at the end of Empire, it's neat to show them being caught off guard or looking like they might get hit and just narrowly get a block but here it looks too...neat.

Also the dialogue is extremely bad. From lines like ""now THIS is podracing!"" and ""I think you can kiss your trade franchise goodbye"", it's obvious this needed a rewrite. Granted a line like ""laugh it off fuzzball"" seems grade 4-ish but at least the way he said it was funny. Here it's just cringe-inducing.

However as the first part of a 6 film saga and the great effects(if spectacularly overdone too), it makes it the worst of the series but somehow watchable. Somehow.",1124496000,,2526,4.444924406047516
657351,5,6303454038,"I've been a fan of ""STAR WARS"" since I was 12 or 13 years old and have seen the original films more than once (see my review of the original trilogy on DVD), so I expected the 1st episode of the saga to be good. When I first saw this movie in 9th grade (my first summer in high school before 9th grade, actually), however, I hated this film, as I expected it to get into the romance between Padme and Anakin, although I did like two scenes (more on that below). Since  ""STAR WARS Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith"" (see my review on this film and the previous installment, ""STAR WARS Episode II: Attack Of The Clones"") will be on DVD and video stores November 1 (can't wait), I thought, ""Might as well check it out again."" Read on.

Well, screw me for having lost faith in Mr. Lucas. I completely changed my opinion of this film when I saw it again for the first time in four years...and with new eyes. I LOVED IT!! For the life of me however, I can't figure out why in bloody hell a lot of die-hard fans bashed this movie (it earned $400 million at the box-office; domestically, anyway) and Jar-Jar Binks. I thought that he was completely comical. Liam Neeson (""Schindler's List"" [see my review on it] and the voice of Aslan in the upcoming ""The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe,"" coming to theaters December 9, 2005), the always-lovely and excellent Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd and Ewan McGregor (whose performance got even better in the next two films) did great jobs in the first of three films which tell the story of how Anakin Skywalker (a terrific Hayden Christensen in ""Episode II"" and ""Episode III"" [see my review on them, as well as the original trilogy], exuding all of Anakin's emotional pain as he struggles between good and evil); the original films deal with-I won't spoil it; those of you who've seen them, shut up and let the newcomers discover the story for themseleves. I particularly liked two scenes (including one which was cut from the film and appears in the deleted scenes section on Disc 2), which I thought were too damn brief. Lucas should've expanded them, but as he says in the ""Deleted Scenes Documentary, ""What interests me might not interest the audience""

...and he was right, unfortunately; but what the hell. Rated PG for sci-fi violence.",1123891200,3,2300,4.550724637681159
657352,4,6303454038,"In modern cinema there is one series of films above all others that has had the biggest impact in one form or another.  Whether the impact is from the groundbreaking CGI effects, revival of a dying genre, epic story telling, or even down to the type of camera used from film to digital, one man and his dream have helped to lead the way in ushering in the next modern age of cinema.  That man is director George Lucas, and his dream is the incredible space saga that began over 20 years ago, `Star Wars'.  In 1977, George Lucas wowed audiences with his epic space saga that took all of us to a galaxy far, far away.  With that initial movie now known as, ""Star Wars - Episode 4: A New Hope"" (back when it was initially released it was known simply as ""Star Wars""), we fell in love with the widest assortment of characters ranging from humans (Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Obi-Wan Kenobi) to the lovable aliens (Chewbacca, Yoda, and yes even the Ewoks), to the most hated, yet we can't seem to get enough of villains (Darth Vader, Boba Fett, and the Emperor).  Lucas held sway over our collective consciousness with his initial trilogy of films that spanned from 1977 to 1983, and at the end leaving audiences wanting more, and more specifically the first three chapters in his 6-part story.  Finally, over 20 years later George Lucas delivered with ""Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"".

""Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"" sets all of the balls into motion that would lead to the events that audiences had already witnessed with the original trilogy.  The basic plotline of the story without going into too much detail, just in case there is still someone that hasn't seen any of this series, is as follows.  There is a growing darkness in the galaxy, as the Trade Federation is threatening to take over the planet Naboo, home to Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) who happens to have a seat on the Galactic Republic Senate, and is one of its most valued members.  To save the Queen, the Jedi Council headed by Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), send out 2 of their best Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and a much younger Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor).  Through their quest to save the Queen and bring her safely to the Republic's capital city on Coruscant, the Jedi encounter Jar-Jar Binks (by far the most annoying character in the entire `Star Wars' universe) and a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd).  The discovery of young Anakin, prompts Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan to see to it that Anakin is trained in the ways of the Force.  As Qui-Gon and the council are beginning to believe that Anakin is more than just another Jedi, he may be the `Chosen One', one of the most powerful Jedi, and who would bring balance back to the Force, allowing the Jedi to overcome the impending evil that is arising in the form of the Sith, led by Darth Sidious and his apprentice Darth Maul.

With all the hype surrounding the return of the `Star Wars' saga, it really comes as no surprise that ""Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"" somewhat failed to meet expectations.  With that much hype, I really don't believe any movie could have overcome the public's belief of what the film should be.  Critics hated the film, citing that it was too much of a kid's movie, with an over-reliance on CGI characters and effects, and incredibly wooden acting and dialogue.  Many of the core fans of the series deserted after the release of this movie, but were brought back into the fold 3 years later with the release of `Episode 2'.  My thoughts are that though this movie was a little more `kiddie' than the previous installments, it kind of had to be due to the fact that we were starting Anakin Skywalker's journey as a young boy, and through this prequel trilogy he would age and progress on his journey towards the Dark Side of the Force, until his ultimate betrayal of all that was good inside him when he transforms into Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith.  Also, any nay-sayers should really hold their comments until after they have seen the entire prequel trilogy so they could get a feel for the overall story, though I thought the overall story was presented with a very good and very strong beginning with ""Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"", and the overall story only got stronger with the next 2 installments.

If you're a fan of the original `Star Wars' trilogy, or just generally love really good sci-fi movies or want to watch a movie series that feels epic and grand, then the `Star Wars' saga is definitely for you, and now the entire series has been released and is available to watch.

But after that it goes into a sort of low point where not much is going on. One of my favorite scenes though is where Obi Wan and Kwi Gon find Jar Jar Binks, who is funny for about five minutes, but then just gets annoying (In the scene on Tatooine where Jar Jar aggrivates Subulba I was hoping Sebulba might rip his throat out). The movie picks back up when Anakin races his pod. The best scene in the movie. Then it slows back down till the end when the Gungan army fights the droid army, and Obi Wan and Kwi Gon fight Darth Maul.

657452,3,6303454038,"This movie wasn't bad at all it just doesn't have the classic original Star Wars feel to it!!! It was entertaining though especially Jar Jar Binks. The movie gives you an idea about how life was before the rise of the Empire. It shows how the Republic has grown corrupt and reveals the return of the sith, and the begging of the end.

 Once you see episode 2 and 3 you'll see the whole cycle and see how it becomes a story. This movie shows Dart Vader/ Anakin Skywalker as a little boy and from the very begging he shows how powerful he is by: winning the intense pod race(great part in the movie) and being a major factor in the battle of Naboo!!!

 This movie widens the universe of Star Wars and shows the difference between 1977 from 1999. Episode 1 features some awesome computer generated material, and visual beauty. This movie also gives you the origns of characters: like Darth Siduios/The Emperor, Obi Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Padme Amidala, R2D2, and C3PO!!! The movie gives you the basic idea of how the Star Wars universe is and what it will become!!! It was indeed important to release this movie!!!

 The movie starts off when the droid armies of The Trade Federation/big players in episode 2 and 3/ threathen to invade Naboo!!! Jedi Knight Qui Gon Jin and his padwan Obi Wan Kenobi go to force a negation, as you imangine things don't go as planed!!!

 From their the movie takes off in a mix of action adventure and some comedy. Anyways, they manage to make their way on Naboo and help queen Amidala escape and break through the blockade, thanks to R2d2 of course!!! They must then land on Tatoonie for repairs: Qui Gon Jin, Jar Jar Binks, and Padme (the real queen) set out and meet Anakin and C3po, imangine the thearpy sessions if C3po ever found out that Darth Vader was his father, that would be some great material to film... huh,  *cough*

 Anyways, Anakin shows signs in the force from the very begging, with the pod race, and has the highest midiclorian account in the history!!! He then comes with Qui Gon Jin , then their is the first encounter by the mysterious Darth Maul!!! Well... you get the point this movie tells you about the history of Star Wars at the beggining. I do think they could have made the movie better, though!!!

 Overall, to understand the full saga of Star Wars this is a must have and it's also a great action packed movie, so it is a win, win senario!!! I give this movie a 3.5/5!!! This is a great film but, is over shadowed by the rest of the saga!!!

657455,5,6303454038,"The Force is used to create things. Life... indeed, creativity is the force itself. What I fail to recognize in these posts by others who have watched the movie is their own creativity in response to the movie. Not all things have failures.

The creation of cities started under water; the creation of states started in space. These things are majestic.

What we fail to understand here is like episode ii, where the force is boring. At times this movie drags on so long you can't naturally get the plot, nor are you interested in things like evil.

Some points:

; Darth Sidious has been taught by Darth Plagus and then murdered Plagus sometime in an attempt to usurp his position and power. Sith deal in extremes, eternity, and absolutes.

; The Jedi study what Qui-Gonn believes is the ""Jedi Arts"". This means they pursue the human character more than the violence of forcing others to be moral and correct. In fact, not only would this destroy the human character of beings who pretend to be superior, but would naturally cause others to attack it. The force cannot be attacked. It is a concept that is reiterated over and over again in this film.

; Darth Maul is the definition of real magic power, which is why it is hard to understand the beliefs of the movie. Darth Maul smiles at all fake magic power and real magic power combined. So he's the meaning of life and meaningless magic power together. An intriguing character, to say the least.

; It is very ethical for the trade federation to own droids with weapons, because in this universe, the freedom of trade (contraband and illegality) across planets, and greed, cannot be protected. Trade has a natural ally in the unwise. So ""Greed can be a powerful ally"" is a healthy quote, reflecting maturity. Another thing is that the power of conglomerates across planescapes that occur in natural settings would require the formation of armies, not organic or living or sentient at all, to protect them. If they were sentient, they might resolve to smuggle or steal the shipments. This is the Star Wars universe. Hopefully when we go out into space, we'll be wiser and not be as judgmental or harsh with our laws that this would be required. But according to the Star Wars universe, this is possible. Perhaps it is a statement against galactic government across planets? The ego is not wise enough perhaps.

I also believe that if this were a movie not about Anakin, but about pure morality, it would not really create the imaginations you would come to expect from Star Wars. At least this was formulaic, if you think so, and generated a lot of sympathy. It would feel more like death. Someone telling you what to do but not being able to do it. That's not the force, nor a good definition of that spiritual concept.

Try to imagine what others may have expected. Jedis destroying racism.... Jedis destroying all inhuman acts of goodwill... Jedis making judgments and resolving things... if you have read some books in the Star Wars universe, you know you dread these moments and want to get back to the points where they're fighting and losing and escaping, much like this movie was.

Pretty soon, you have a barren planet, and nothing on it but junk. Kind of like Tatooine. So the Force creates complexity.",1121644800,,3266,4.674216027874564
657456,1,6303454038,"STAR WARS EPISODE I: The Phantom Storyline

On the small planet of Naboo, the Trade Federation organised a blockade with GIGANTIC, FULLY ARMED SPACESHIPS to protest against the new law on taxation.

This is obviously reason enough for the Galactic Senate to send two highly decorated Jedi as embassadors to lead the negotiations ...

And this is obviously enough for George Lucas to build an entire Star Wars film around it.

The Trade Federation, led by two frogs with a borderline racist accent, accepts help from Darth Sidious for no obvious reason, and vice versa. Think about it: the film suggests that the galaxy had to suffer greatly under the dominion of the Sith. And yet these braindead frogs ask the powerful Lord Sidious for help? And he accepts it? But I'm sure trading fits into Darth Sidious' evil scheme ... somehow.

So, eventually Sidious orders them to invade Naboo and sign some ominous contract. Why? Because he's EVIL, you see?

But there's no point in asking; as soon as the two Jedi, Qui- Gon Jinn and his padawan Obi- Wan Kenobi, escape the clutches of the federation and land on Naboo, the movie loses, or willfully abandons its plot. About 20 minutes into the film. Bravo! What did you do during the last 16 years, George?

After 20 minutes, the movie is only busy with telling us why we're going to the next location, but there's no real goal to look forward to.

The characters are equally bleak and lack substance, but let them introduce themselves (gone are the days in which a character is defined by its actions):

Qui- Gon Jinn: ""My name's Qui Gon Jinn. I'm only spouting supposedly wise lines during the entire film. Oh, and I get killed, but you already know that if you own the Soundtrack. And I'm also explaining that Midichlorian dreck, which ruins every ounce of mystery Star Wars had.""

Obi- Wan: ""I'm Obi- Wan Kenobi, and I say hardly anything in this film. My only purpose is to answer my master and to kill Darth Maul.""

Jar Jar Binks: ""Meesa Jar Jar Binkse, meesa in big doodoo, meesa stealing screen time, meesa worst character ever to be conceived by mankind! And meesa acting obnoxiously!""

Qui Gon: ""Just do it like me, don't act at all! I don't move my face, even when our submarine is stuck in the mouth of a giant monster fish as big as a house.""

Queen Amidala aka Padme: ""I'm Padme Queen Amidala. I can't move my face and I'm changing my clothes every 5 minutes.""

Anakin Skywalker: ""Am I not cuuuute? Isn't it fantastically satisfying when a whole planet gets rescued by a slapstick moment of a 7- year old kid like me?""

Darth Maul: ""..."" *rolls eyes*

That's basically all there's to say about them. Every actor seems like a foreign object in this film. So wooden, so irritatingly bland. My favourite line comes from Padme: ""IaskYouNoIbegYouToHelpUs"".

So, after a series of distinct events, held together by the ambition to let two hours pass and arrive at the end credits, we get to the big battle. A small group tries to capture the head of the trade federation inside the Naboo palace, while a bunch of bad looking, worse lit CGI figures (in the movie referred to as ""the Gungans"" and ""the droids"") battle outside on a huge, empty grass field, in broad daylight, which only serves to make the battle look even more fake.

The cool, dark fight between Darth Maul, Qui- Gon and Obi- Wan, the best scene in the film (no surprise) gets constantly intercut with the obnoxious, infantile jiggling around of Jar Jar Screenkiller Binks and Padme's purposeless search for the trading king.

Eventually, Anakin manages to blow up the entire commando ship of the federation by accident, the droids fall to the ground, Obi- Wan kills Darth Maul, the day is saved, and we don't care.

Then we have a little epilogue. At Qui- Gon's funeral, Mace Windu and Yoda talk about the Sith:

Mace: ""Which one was destroyed, the apprentice or ... the master?""

- close- up Chancellor Palpatine -

Audience: ""That was subtle.""

WHAT was his film all about? Why do we have to have the big battle? Why was Naboo invaded? Taxes? Come on ...

Furthermore, we learn that Jedi are nothing more than a bunch of spiritual cops, there to lead negotiations and to go rampant once in a while.

Hell, in the original Star Wars, ""guardians of peace and justice"" meant something heroic and romantic because there was an *actual threat* for the Jedi to take care of.

What's the threat here? The Jedi paying more taxes?

The celebration song at the end is so infinitely sillier and inappropriate than the already obnoxious Ewok chanting that it chases you out of the room.

And the worst thing is that this flick is just a warm- up for the gigantic turkey that would later be known as ""Attack Of The Clones"" ...",1121385600,9,4732,4.620071684587813
657457,4,6303454038,"If I had done a writeup for this before seeing ""Episode 2 - Attack Of The Clones"" there would not have been a chance of giving it anything over three stars, and despite the awesome visuals and some great new characters, I would have been tempted (though I probably wouldn't have done it) to drop it straight down to a two-star rating due to my crushing disappointment with certain aspects of the film, which I'll elaborate on later.  After seeing ""Attack Of the Clones"" and reassessing ""Phantom Menace"", this one would have been assured of a strong 3-stars and there may have been an inclination to go for four.  After ""Revenge Of The Sith"" Episode 1 now does indeed get a four-star rating, partly because I understand it better and partly because it's an integral part of what turned out to be a new trilogy rivalling the original.

For the film itself - in the original trilogy, and in the novels that followed years later (two of the best being ""Heir To The Empire"" and ""The Truce At Bakura""), we got a certain perception of what the Old Republic and the Jedi Knights were like, or at least I did. A practically utopic galaxy in most aspects.  The Jedis as noble defenders of justice and peace and all that is good.  Harmony among the races.  A galactic Golden Age that had lasted eons, with prosperity and freedom for all, right up until the Sith came.

This is not what Episode 1 showed. The Republic and its 'glorious' Jedis, nearly all of the ones we get to know seeming to have a disconcerting air of superiority about them, allow slavery and other organized criminal activity to survive and flourish, as long as it's in the outer systems, far enough away not to be a bother to the prosperous core worlds of the New Republic.  It's shocking to see Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi so....pompous, basically.  And hypocritical, although we do see them seem to start coming around later on, progressing towards the characters everybody knew and loved in the first trilogy.  I understand it now though - 1) we're not just seeing that Anakin Skywalker was good and then went bad, we're seeing Why he went bad, and 2) the decay was creeping into the Republic long prior to the arrival of Sidious and Darth Maul; perhaps there was a time, not too many decades before Episode 1, where the galaxy was as idyllic as it was made out to have been; but it's not now, as the movie opens.  And the Jedis have been too overconfident and complacent to notice it, perhaps too complacent to realize how much they're letting slide.  One of the few major characters we're introduced to who actually is striving to better the whole of the galaxy, not just maintain the privelaged status quo, is Padme, who was one of this film's saving graces even before the hindsights given by Episode 2.  Another interesting thing - the reaction to the droids, including C-3PO and R2-D2 but also droids in general.  Most characters seem to react to them as if they're lower-class peons.  The Jedis ignore them except when they're giving them orders, basically acting as if they're toasters.  All this in spite of the fact that all indications through the original trilogy, and through this one too starting right here, that they give all appearances of being at least partly if not fully sentient (I always thought Luke's ""offer"" to Jabba in ""Return Of The Jedi"" was a ruse not meant to be taken seriously).  Only Padme, Annakin and Jar-Jar, perhaps Shmi Skywalker as well, interact and speak with the droids the same way they would any other lifeform.  And as for Jar-Jar Binks, can people give him half a break?  Yes, he accidentally gets in the way alot, and can even be annoying at times, but he's got a genuine heart, which seems to be more than you can say about half the Jedi Council.

So many surprises, both when I first saw this and that I'm seeing in a new light now.  Who would have ever guessed, based on the original trilogy, that Darth Vader/Annakin Skywalker was a child born into slavery who spent his spare time freeing little animals from various predicaments because 'every creature deserves to be free'?  Who would have guessed that after the Jedis rescued Annakin from his slavery, they would have LEFT HIS MOTHER AND THE REST OF THE SLAVES TO ROT under Watto's ownership? (the apparant - and highly troubling - explanation seems to be that they just saw no need to free them, as opposed to Annakin who they wanted to free not for his own sake, but to train such a 'Force-strong' child as a Jedi)  And if you saw this movie first, without Episodes 4-6, who would have guessed at the way the chilling final hour of Episode III would play out?

I'm using up wordage fast, so I'll make the rest of my points quickly - some of the greatest visuals in movie history, as with all three Star Wars prequels.  Darth Maul is a villain worthy of standing on the same pedestal as the Emperor, the Fetts, Thrawn (familiar to the novel readers) and even the greatest and most terrible of them all, Vader.  Jake Lloyd is great as Anakin, Natalie Portman is great as Padme (although she's even better in the next two), Terrence Stamp gives an impressive if brief turn as Chancellor Vallorum and Ian McDiamind is perfect in all three movies (he should get an Oscar for this year's ""Revenge Of The Sith"" but the Academy probably won't even consider him.)  More holes in logic here than the next two, by far.  Other points I'll wait and cover in my Episode 2 writeup.

In the end, I've upped my opinion of this film because I've learned to stop mourning the prequels I thought I was going to get (they'll always be alive in my head) and enjoy this magnificent new trilogy, weakest chapter included, for the prequels we got.",1120953600,3,5689,4.560903732809431
657458,4,6303454038,"When most fans watched with great anticipation,  1999's ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"", they fully were aware they were watching the first of a ""prequel"" trilogy to the widely successful ""Star Wars"" trilogy that was made between 1977 and 1983.  For those familiar with the original trilogy, it is going to be almost impossible not to watch the prequel trilogy and begin to try to piece together how things will eventually evolve into the original trilogy.  I've tried to make an attempt to watch ""Episode I"" and see how the movie stands on its own - without knowing the story of the latter movies.  This was not as easy to do it seems - and much of what is done in this movie will really only make sense in the big scheme of the entire Star Wars story.  However, as difficult as it is to view this objectively - it turns out that this really is a pretty good movie no matter how you look at it.

For those familiar with the Star Wars trilogy, this movie is the first of the prequel to the original Star Wars that follows the story of Luke Skywalker's father Anakin - from boyhood to his turn to the ""dark side"" of the force.  When I watched this movie, I tried to erase any preconceived notions of knowing there was a Luke Skywalker - this was difficult, but it does make things interesting.  The storyline is this: There is a group of planets that are loosely governed into a government known as ""The Republic"".  A taxation policy of trade routes has led to a dispute between the Planet Naboo and a Trade Federation organization.  Two Jedi Knights have been dispatched by the Republic's Chancellor to act as ambassadors to try to resolve the dispute - these are the Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (played by Liam Neeson) and his apprentice, a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (played by Ewan McGregor).  Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord who is behind the Trade Federation is very upset by the Jedis getting involved.  When Naboo's Queen Amidala (played by Natalie Portman) is captured by the Trade Federation, it is Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan who rescue her.  Pursued by the Trade Federation, the Jedis have damage to their ship and are forced to land on the desert planet of Tatooine.  It is on Tatooine that they meet a brilliant slave boy - Anakin Skywalker (played by Jake Lloyd).  Qui-Gon immediately takes a liking to Anakin and feels he may be ""a chosen one"" for the Jedis.  When Qui-Gon can't get the parts he needs for the ship's repairs, it is Anakin who plays a key role in helping them get these parts.  Meanwhile, Sidious has dispatched his apprentice Darth Maul to go after the Jedis.  One the ship's repairs are made, the focus on the movie switches two fold: 1) The Jedis work with Queen Amidala to help liberate Naboo from the oppression of the Trade Federation; 2) Qui-Gon works with the Jedi Council to convince them to let him train the boy as a Jed while trying to figure out who Darth Maul is.  The battle on Naboo and the showdown between Darth Maul against Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan will highlight the movie's climax.

The role of Anakin Skywalker is significant.  If you know the Star Wars story, these quotes will make sense.  If you aren't - these quotes will help add to the intrigue of what will come in subsquent ""episodes"".

Anakin's Mother: ""He was meant to help you""; ""There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him. I can't explain what happened."" (a quote that has lead to obvious and justified criticism from Christians)

Qui-Gon: ""Something about this boy""

Senator Palpatine: ""We will watch your career with great interest"" (referring to Anakin)

Yoda: ""Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you."" (again referring to Anakin)

One thing I didn't like was that there seemed to be a lack of character development on the part of Obi-Wan Kenobi.  In fact, really for a good chunk of the movie - it is fair to say that Obi-Wan is a minor character.  He was relegated to staying behind with the ship on Tatooine while Qui-Gon was with Anakin trying to get the parts to repair the ship.  But it seems like ""all of the sudden"" things are rushed toward the end with making Obi-Wan the ""hero"".

The one thing that is difficult to follow with this movie - whether you know the original Star Wars story or not is that the politics of this movie are extremely difficult to follow.  Understanding what the roles of the Republic, Trade Federation, Chancellors, Jedi Knights, and even the Sith Lords are pretty confusing throughout the movie - especially the politics of the Republic and Trade Federation.  I found if this could have been simplified - I think this would have made for a much more enjoyable movie.

The character of Jar-Jar Binks took a lot of criticism - and fairly so.  Jar-Jar is someone who saves Qui-Gon's life on Naboo and eventually joins him.  Unfortunately, his role is basically more of a comic role.  I have always felt that Anthony Daniels' C3PO role has done a better job at comic relief.  Jar-Jar's role - although key when the Battle of Naboo takes place, seemed to be unnecessary in terms of this comic role.  On a side note, we are told of the origins of the droids C3P0 and R2D2 in this movie.

Despite the shortcomings I mention above.  I still enjoyed this movie.  This movie did entertain me - and it won't disappoint in terms of action and special effects.  I'd recommend it - and I'd recommend to try to watch it by blocking out what you know of the original trilogy - it will give it a new twist.",1120867200,2,5536,4.510531594784353

""And you young Skywalker. We shall watch your career with great interest.""

""Train the boy, Obi-Wan. He is the Chosen One.""

""Wipe them out. All of them.""

- The ""Star Wars"" saga begins with Darth Maul planning to expose himself, former Senator turned Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine plays guidance counselor to a young Anakin Skywalker, while Jedi Knight, Qui-Gon Jinn gives a final word to his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi, but, all Darth Sidous wants is galactic domination by wiping the slate clean & remaining ""The Phantom Menace""

Seventeen years after the conclusion of the ""Star Wars"" saga, with ""Return Of The Jedi"", creator George Lucas directs the first prequel episode entitled ""The Phantom Menace"".

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far, away..., galactic trade routes are under severe scrutiny at the hands of the Trade Federation, led by the insectoid-like Vicorey, Nute Gunray. When trade routes to the small planet of Naboo are cut off, an agressive act even by Federation standards, two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn & his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi, are sent to peacefully resolve the situation. Jedi Knights are guardians of peace & justice to the galaxy. They believe in the power of ""The Force"", an energy force that combines the galaxy together.

Unbeknownst to the Jedi, Gunray is secretly in league with an evil Jedi, known as a Sith Lord, named Darth Sidious. Sidious commands Gunray to an all out invasion & ultimate control of Naboo with the planet's ruling Queen, Padme Amidala, being forced to sign a treaty between the Federation and her people. If Amidala doesn't sign the treaty her people will meet ostrication.

Sidious also makes a move to kill the Jedi & upon their arrival on board Gunray's Federation Control Ship, the Jedi are attacked by Federation battle droids & are forced to quickly come up with their own battle plan.

Qui-Gon & Obi-Wan sneak aboard a transport ship to Naboo's surface and with the help of the floppy eared, IQ challenged, aquatic Gungan, Jar-Jar Binks help Queen Amidala to escape from Naboo, aboard her royal starship.

The plan is to get Queen Amidala to the city planet of Coruscant & to the Republic senate. There she can confer with the Naboo senator, Palpatine, & find out what is going on with Naboo, whose behind the attack, & why. The Jedi's plan runs astray while escaping from the planet, as Gunray attacks the Queen's ship, destroying their hyperdrive (a device that can get them to their destination in a quarter of the time).

After an emergency landing on the sand planet of Tatooine, Qui-Gon & the Queen search for suitable replacement parts, & have a run in with the junk dealer Watto. Watto informs Qui-Gon that he does have the part but the money the Jedi has is no good. But hope isn't all lost when Qui-Gon meets Anakin Skywalker a young boy who works with Watto at the junkyard & is Watto's slave. Qui-Gon senses an extreme prescence of ""The Force"" in Anakin & comes to the conclusion that he might be the chosen one who can bring balance to ""The Force"", as well as, peace to the galaxy. Through the art of gambling & a little usage of ""The Force"", Qui-Gon gets the much needed part & frees Anakin from Watto.

Finally, making it to Coruscant, Queen Amidala confers with Senator Palaptine & the Senate & receives a shock. The Supreme Chancelor, Valorum, decides that Naboo is to be under Federation control until proper measures can be taken with the Senate. Amidala fires off a vote of no confidence and Valorum is replaced (through a Senate vote) with, to the surprise of all, Senator Palpatine as the new acting Chancelor.

But, Amidala decides not to sit by the sidelines and watch her people suffer & decides to lead the attack, with the aid of Qui-Gon & Obi-Wan, to take back the planet of Naboo & free her people. She also gets help from an unlikely source.

With Nute Gunray unable to retrieve Queen Amidala, Darth Sidious sends out his own Sith apprentice, Darth Maul, to retrieve the Queen (to sign the treaty), kill the two jedi, & take control of Naboo.

All bets are off as the battle for Naboo commences with the Jedi & the Sith facing off for the first time in over a thousand years.

""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" is a great film, but, can't quite measure up to the first three ""Star Wars"" films (I personally rank this Episode last in the overall saga).

Watching the first three films a million+ times over it was really odd to watch a ""Star Wars"" film without hardly any of the classic characters. Sure, their is Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, See-Threepio & Artoo Detoo, but, their isn't any Luke, Leia, or Han Solo, either.

It was great to see the beginnings of a lot of the ""Star Wars"" mythos & their are some classic scenes in here. Obi-Wan & Anakin meeting for the first time, the introduction of Artoo-Detoo (people freaked at the showing I was at when Captain Panaka reads Artoo's call sign to Queen Amidala), are just a few.

The highlight's of the film are easily the podrace sequence (that wins Anakin his freedom from Watto, & gets the part for the Queen's ship), the lightsabre duel between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan & Darth Maul (the Jedi are at the top of their game here), & the battle for Naboo.

The movie almost collapses with two things - Jake Lloyd's acting & Jar-Jar Binks. The overall acting is also ""limited"". Lucas never really confers with his actors unless he wants to try to something different, his way. It seems to be his way or the highway. Either way its a major fault of Lucas' & hurts this film as well as the following two prequels. Faster, more intense, sometimes, just isn't enough.

The effects are quite a standout and are better than all the effects from ""The Matrix"" films put together. Don't believe me? If you watch the film again, keep in mind that the Gungan/battle droid battle for Naboo is all digitally realized, with the only true element being the grassy field the battle takes place on (the Oscar for best FX that year should have went to this film & not ""The Matrix"").

""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" is best presented in the widescreen format, with Dolby Digital EX and enough of ""The Force"" to put Darth Maul back together again.",1119916800,,6263,4.653985507246377
657498,4,6303454038,"After six years, I finally bought this movie on DVD. Only had it on VHS. As a practitioner of the Star Wars fan boy alliance (not really), I finally want to share my thoughts about the prequel trilogy starting with my second favorite of the three: Episode I.

Even though this film starts the saga, I recommend, even for first timers, to watch the original trilogy first, Because without them, this one just doesn't give a proper introduction to the galaxy far far away. Except the first time Jedi take out lightsabers on the Federation ship. When I saw this movie in 1999, I was amazed how much of the pace was very similar to Episode IV, the original Star Wars, since it was the only one of the original trilogy to had been directed by George Lucas. Now he returns in the director's seat with this trilogy, and it is great. Now, don't mind all the ""wooden dialogue"" accusations, although they are true. But, if you don't understand the plot, with all due respect, you have no business whatsoever watching this film and you must have ADD. Like in the original trilogy, i believe, contrasting what many people might think, this is a movie that requires your full attention to really grasp and feel for the characters. The story is only confusing if you don't know anything about this little planet we live in, because the political conflict in the movie is pretty clear, despite what some dumb dumbs might think.

Also, this takes me back to the original trilogy. Without watching that first, you really don't know where this political thing is leading to. Unless, you are watching the whole saga as a big movie, it can leave a lot of open spots. Visually, I think it is the best of the trilogy. The lightsabers look the best in this movie. In the last 2 the color on the sabers is too strong, and the sound isn't as thunderous as that last battle with Darth maul at the end of this one.

Like the original Star Wars, what's so great about this movie is that it can be a stand alone film (sorta, if you don't really count the destiny that will befall on the characters on account of everything that happens here). It's a nice sci fi adventure, with fun action and deep Star Wars philosophy and myth, although, once again many people didn't seem to appreciate it. Of course, the movie is just one piece of the puzzle, the problem is that each piece left a big whole Lucas filled every 3 years, which is why this films I think were received the way they were. They left too many questions and doubts.

The acting was FINE. Star Wars is no place for over actors, specially when you are portraying a centered and peaceful Jedi. It was FINE. In the context of all the films this one definitely stands out and I hope more people see that.

If you wanna get into Star Wars, forget about a rental, because if you are serious about it, you'll definitely buy it. you will not regret it, unless you are one of this close minded people who don't understand how fantasy can look at the human spirit right at its core.",1119657600,,3004,4.434782608695652
657499,5,6303454038,"In league with the Dark Lords of the Sith, the Trade Federation blockades the peaceful planet called Naboo. The leader of the Republic, the Supreme Chancellor, sends two Jedi Knights it investigate the matter.  Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Qui-Gon Jinn and Padm Naberrie, the Queen's handmaiden, encounters a nine-year-old slave named Anakin Skywalker.

657500,4,6303454038,"Chronologically, ""Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" is supposed to be the first of a six-part saga, yet one gets the feeling right at the start that one is in the middle of something, almost as if there ought to have been a prequel before this one, as the vessel carrying two alleged ""ambassadors"" representing the Galactic Republic approaches one of the droid control vessels participating in a ""legal"" blockade of the planet Naboo. The ""ambassadors"" are none other than two Jedi knights, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his Padawan apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), who have come to enter into ""negotiations"" with the ""greedy"" Trade Federation regarding the blockade.

As Kenobi points out, they certainly were, only the outcome was, to say the least, not what was expected: a droid army is poised to invade Naboo. The Jedi smuggle themselves, undiscovered, on separate vessels and end up on the surface of Naboo. They encounter a rather dizzy-headed local, a Gungan named Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), who agrees to take them (apparently on pain of death) to his city, where Boss Nass (Brian Blessed) has little time both for the Jedi and the Naboo and dismisses them, albeit after he agrees to give them a transport and to let Binks accompany them. Plying the planet core has its own, rather fishy hazards, but they manage to get to the city, albeit after Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) and her entourage have been captured. A quick light-sabre fight despatches the escorting droids and the entourage escapes with the help of Naboo pilots and, in the particular case of the Queen's vessel, a little astro-droid designated R2-D2 (Kenny Baker).

All is not well, however, as the ship is forced to divert to a planet called Tatooine owing to a malfunctioning propulsion system. Gui-Jon meets a rather sly and devious Troydarian named Watto (voiced wonderfully by Andrew Secombe, almost as if he were French!), who has exactly what they need, but credits won't do fine, much to his inner frustration. Amidala, disguised as a hand-maiden, encounters a little slave boy named Anakin (Jake Lloyd), who declares himself to be an avid pod-racer and being good at his hands, as his home-made protocol droid, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), shows, even if it is ""naked"", as R2-D2 points out. It turns out that he is not all he seems, but that would be to say that one already knows how he turns out later in life. All we should know now is that ""there's something about this boy"", given the snippets of evidence that attract Qui-Gon's attention: fast reactions and the fact that apparently he had no father, according to his mother Shmi (Pernilla August). Microscopic life-forms called ""midi-chlorians"" rest in the cells of all Jedi, and an analysis of the boy's blood reveals that he has them. Herein lies the apparent biochemical explanation for the ""Force"" (much to many fans' annoyance, as they would have preferred it to have remained mysterious and thus inexplicable).

However, the fact is that, without suitable parts for their ship, they are stuck, so it is up to Anakin to participate in a colourful, yet highly dangerous and no-holds-barred pod-race - and not just because of the natural obstacles, but also Tusken raiders and devious ""slimeballs"" like Sebulba (Lewis Macleod), upon whom Watto is prepared to bet everything. Qui-Gon seizes his chance to capitalize on Tatooine's main strength/weakness, gambling, and Watto unwisely accepts the bet that would result in the boy's freedom. The pod-race is undoubtedly the highlight of the movie, being as it is a nod to the chariot-race in the classic 1959 movie, ""Ben-Hur"", but should only be seen as a vital link to the chain of events that would see young Anakin part, almost tearfully, from his mother, who advises him to ""be brave"" and not look back.

Just when one thought one might relax, up comes a rather sinister light-sabre-wielding character, who briefly duels with Qui-Gon before the Queen's ship escapes to Coruscant, the home of the Jedi Council. There, Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) outlines the situation: a weak leadership by Chancellor Valorum (Terence Stamp) and ""greedy, squabbling delegates"" with ""no interest in the common good"". Political machinations are rife in the senate and, on Palpatine's advice, Amidala, now in full regalia, calls for a vote of no confidence in Valorum, since he apparently appears not to want to take immediate action as regards the invasion of her home planet. This vote is an opportunity immediately seized upon by the senate. In the meantime, Qui-Gon tells the Council, including Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and the ever-wise Yoda (Frank Oz), of his conviction that the boy is the one to fulfil the prophecy of being ""the Chosen One"", yet Yoda sees danger in the boy, who fears losing his mother. Right here, Yoda makes references to the so-called ""Dark Side"", a path which he fears the boy will take - only more pressing concerns now require them all to travel to Naboo.

The Queen is determined to take back Naboo from the Trade Federation and Jar Jar proves a most unlikely link, as he succeeds in getting Boss Nass to help them. While a classic scene from the 1960 movie, ""Spartacus"", comes to mind as opposing armies (in this case, droid and Gungan) face each other, the Queen's party, including the Jedi and the captain of her royal guard, Panaka (Hugh Quarshie), succeed in entering the palace and capturing Viceroy Nute Gunray (Silas Carson, who also played the pilot of the ship seen at the start of the movie). However, the mysterious double light-sabre wielding character reappears: Darth Maul (Ray Park) takes on both Jinn and Kenobi in a scene that ranks amongst the best choreographed fight scenes on film reminiscent of Chinese martial arts (""Wu Xia"") films. The two knights are separated, leaving one to face the attacker: one mistake proves fatal, and the end for one of the knights is predictable. It is therefore up to the other to avenge him, which he does. As he lies dying, Jinn makes Kenobi promise that he will train Anakin, a decision he had already taken, defying the wishes of the Council, who, at Jinn's sombre funeral, wonder who had been destroyed - the master or the apprentice Sith Lord: one gets an answer as the camera focuses in on Palpatine.

George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" had already had an established reputation more than two decades by the time ""Episode I"" came out, and a lot of the criticism of the movie has come from people who insist on comparing this with the movies that started the whole saga. Yet every story has a beginning, and, while some characters have been dismissed by some as ""irritating"" and some dialogue as ""boring"", the fact is that it would be totally unrealistic, as in real life, even in ""Star Wars"", NOT to have characters who some people may think are ""irritating"" and NOT to have dialogue which some people may think is ""boring"". As Qui-Gon himself said to Obi-Wan, ""keep your concentration here and now"": meaning, perhaps, that fans of the movies ought to bear in mind that this story takes place chronologically first and so should ""forget"" most, if not all, of what they know of what happens in the saga later - black masks, heavy breathing and all.",1119484800,2,7227,4.871544715447154

The dispute is just an excuse to invade the planet. Evil forces are aligning to manipulate Queen Amidala's power. While Qui-Gon and Kenobi try to save the queen, they hide in the desert planet of Tatooine, where they meet a slave boy, Anakin Skywalker, who helps them when trouble shows up.

Jinn recognizes in Skywalker unique talents and suspects he may be the ""Chosen One"". Prophecies pointed out that a great Jedi Knight would emerge and bring balance and equilibrium to the Universe.

The Phantom Menace takes us to the past, something unusual as we already know the end of the story. Shadows from Episodes 4, 5 and 6 are clearly present in this film, not only because this movies conform a legacy that still today are very powerful, but because his creator, George Lucas, has elaborated a script that takes elements from all the previous episodes.

Known faces, like R2-D2, C-3PO, Jabba and the beloved Yoda come to the screen in brief cameos. Also, Lucas steals Hollywood icons to feed his adventure: the Tatooine race is homage to the Ben Hur race. Also, his mythological, religious and political interests are present in E1.

This is a movie clearly made for kids, which comes as a disappointment for all the fans of the original trilogy. The acting is not very good, and the dialog is stiff, clumsy and boring. The Jar Jar character is just plain annoying. It doesn't have that old charm of the early movies. It's saturated of effects. Still, the movie is visually astonishing. TPM is a fantasy adventure that satisfied the expectations of many. But that very same expectation became his greatest weakness, as later was hardly criticized by critics and hard core fans. It should have been much better, and sadly, we just got this video game.",1119398400,,1940,4.796407185628743
657503,2,6303454038,"Actually, I thought this movie was ok to pretty good when I saw it in the theatre. However, upon repeat viewings I liked it less and less. I had read on a Star Wars fan site that I would like Phantom Menace more after seeing Revenge of the Sith. Supposedly, Revenge would bring out all the ""subtleties"" of Phantom. But this did not happen. If anything, I like Phantom less after watching Revenge. For starters, the CGI character Jar Jar Binks is really an irrelevant character. All he does is provide silly slapstick humor and show-off Lucas's new digital toys, which wouldn't be so bad if the character had a purpose. But, we never see this purpose. He's supposed to lead our heroes through the planet core on Naboo, but we never see him provide this info. He goes from outcast to a general in the Gungan army, but does nothing to merit this promotion (though in Jar Jar's defense, the leader of the Gungans' is a pretty asinine character as well). He bumbles through a battle (which unfortunately interrupts an awesome lightsabre duel). And although he has a so-called pivotal scene in Attack of the Clones, nearly any other character could have served this purpose without hurting the movie.  Secondly, the directing is terrible. In multiple scenes it appears that Jake Lloyd (Anakin) is merely reading his lines off cue cards. Surely, Lucas could have gotten better takes of some of these scenes. Third, Obi Wan Kenobi's force powers are inconsistent: At the beginning of the movie he and Qui Gon use force ""speed"" to escape super battle droids, but when it comes time to help Qui Gon fight Darth Maul, Obi Wan runs at normal speed (which conveniently allows Maul and Qui Gon to fight one on one to a stunning end). Finally, this movie just doesn't seem to set up the next two movies very well. Because Anakin's just a young boy, we can't really discern his infatuation with Padme (Luke and Leia's mother). So, when we see these characters in Attack of the Clones, Anakin's obsession with Padme makes him look like a stalker. Moreover, Padme goes from being obviously uncomfortable with Anakin's stalker glares to playing tonsil hockey with him a few scenes later. Way too rushed - and I blame this on Phantom for not developing a relationship between these characters. Overall, I think Phantom is just a wasted opportunity for the Star Wars saga. I recommend this movie only if you are a die hard Star Wars fan.",1119225600,,2416,4.684705882352941

657555,2,6303454038,"I remember seeing this movie in 1999 in theaters as a twelve-year-old.  At that time I thought it was an awesome movie.  It had great special effects and lots of action sequences.  Everything else I virtually ignored.

Now I look back on the movie and realize how God-awful some parts actually are.  My first complaint with the movie is all those idiotic little gags they pulled (that guy whose pod flew apart in the podrace scene, the droid that was sucked into an engine).  My second problem with the movie was the actor who played Anakin Skywalker.  I don't care how young he was at the time, he did a horrible job in this movie.  My third problem with this movie is the presence of Gungans.  Not just Jar Jar...ALL the Gungans, Jar Jar was just the most irritating of them.  The movie would've been better if they weren't in it for comic relief because even as a sixth-grader I was a little cheesed out by lines like ""Yousa in big doo-doo now!"" and Jar Jar's constant screw-ups.  I was also really annoyed by the fact that Darth Maul's face was splattered everywhere, but he was barely in the movie (and barely had any lines when he WAS on camera).  His big scene was obviously the lightsaber battle between him and Qui Gon and Obi Wan, which brings me to the point that I personally felt that both Darth Maul and Qui Gon were just killed off poorly.  What I mean is that their deaths felt a little rushed and not thought out well, kind of like the writers just got lazy so they killed them both off instead of figuring some other way to work them into the trilogy's plot, which I'm almost sure is what happened.

There were a lot of things I did like about the movie:  the aforementioned special effects are one thing, and the well coreographed fight scenes were another.  The fight scenes in particular overshadow those of the original trilogy.  They look a lot more authentic.  And I also think that a lot of really good music was written for this movie as well.  The music was definitely one of my favorite things about this movie.  I liked Darth Maul and thought he showed a lot of promise, but the writers didn't do nearly enough with him, so he ended up as an almost totally wasted character.

The rest of this movie was ok.  There were parts where acting wasn't really that good...mostly because of Jake Lloyd, but not always.  There were a few characters who could've been better or featured more prominently, but other than that it was just ok.

Basically, this movie is pretty bland in some parts and awesome in others which evens it out to be pretty mediocre.",1118707200,3,2575,4.452991452991453

Ray Park simply oozed evil in his portrayal of Darth Maul, making him one of the most memorable movie villains of all time. He far surpassed Emperor Palpatine in his portrayal of hatred. In addition, he showed us why the Jedi so feared the Sith. He is skilled and deadly. Qui-Gon is masterfully played by Liam Neeson, in my estimation, one of the best actors in the world today. You can alost see the lines of power as he reaches out to The Force with his feelings.

Unfortunately, this movie also suffers from some unforgivable sins. First and foremost, Jake Lloyd (as Annakin Skywalker) couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. He is truly awful. Natalie Portman has certainly acted better, as well. Her performance seems uninspired and forced. Yoda looked terrible, and overall, the movie seemed lackluster, almost as if it were made for the sole purpose of bringing the Star Wars franchise back into the spotlight at the expense of good film making.

Disappointing, but a necessary buildup to the eventual fall of Annakin Skywalker to The Dark Side, and his recreation as Darth Vader.",1118102400,,1203,4.806763285024155
657557,4,6303454038,"I admit, I've been a little late to the STAR WARS party. Sure, in the past I had caught the famous original trilogy, but the whole STAR WARS phenomenon didn't compel me enough to check out this film and EPISODE II in theaters. Now that EPISODE III has come out (and, of course, made big bucks at the box office), though, I figure I owed it to myself not only to revisit the original trilogy, but finally sit down and watch the newer films as well.

So I'm in the process, and today I finally got to THE PHANTOM MENACE, which was released in 1999 amidst eager anticipation and hype and so-so reviews from the critics.

It's not quite as bad as many critics said. Sure, George Lucas' plot---something to do with violent conflict regarding trade routes---is rather incoherent and near-incomprehensible, but I was certainly not bored by it. The myriad visual sights Lucas (digitally) creates for the film, and some of the action scenes and special effects, are often so awesome to look at that the film often compels in spite of its serious flaws.

Still, I'm not a moviegoer who is seduced merely by visual allure and interesting technological trickery (as important as it can be in film, which is a visual medium, above all), so for me storytelling this sloppy, dialogue this stiff, and acting this wooden is pretty hard to ignore. Lucas is lucky to have an old pro like Liam Neeson to play Qui-Gon Jinn; Neeson may not be the most electrifying actor in the world---and he certainly isn't under Lucas' careless direction---but he can almost always be counted on to at least emanate a sense of authority in his performances, and he accomplishes that task once again here, even among Lucas' cheesy dialogue. Jake Lloyd, the cute young boy who plays Anakin Skywalker in this film, is unfortunately not so lucky. To my surprise, I didn't find him quite as awful as many others have made the kid out to be; clearly, Lucas cast him for his innocent look, as perhaps a stab at irony---this cute kid is gonna turn into Darth Vader someday? Impossible! Lloyd has his moments---he's genuinely touching when saying goodbye to his ever-concerned mother---but it's ultimately an extremely uneven performance. He may have one or two good scenes before he comes up with a line reading so unbelievably cutesy and amateurish I couldn't bear to blame it all on Lloyd; it had to be Lucas who was staring at a blue screen instead of focusing on his actors. The rest of the cast copes decently, I suppose, although Samuel L. Jackson, as Mace Windu, simply looks bored to me onscreen in the few scenes he has in this film (although, considering what he has to utter, I can't necessarily blame him).

As for the storytelling, I was never caught up in the whole trade-conflict thing. But then, is plot ever really the point of the STAR WARS movies? Lucas may throw in tidbits of plot here and there, but when those fight scenes roar to life, plot becomes secondary to sheer energy level. (It's basically good-versus-evil, a theme that's become so old that it barely qualifies as a serious artistic theme anymore.) Still, it's hard to watch the impressive pod-race scene in the middle of the film without realizing how arbitrary and pointless the scene is; Lucas uses Sebulba's resistance to Jedi mind tricks as an excuse to throw in a big, dumb, but technically impressive action setpiece. At least there was a real one-thing-after-another momentum in the original STAR WARS to keep viewers from asking too many questions about plot; Lucas' pacing here is not nearly as forward-moving, and so big questions inevitably pop up (especially with his lackluster attempt at a plot twist when it turns out that ""handmaiden"" Padme Amidala is actually the real Queen---so why the hell was everyone near her addressing the decoy Queen as if she was the real McCoy, anyway?).

Despite all its huge flaws, though, STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE has enough visual splendor and impressive special effects to make the film diverting, even if you're never really caught up in the plot or its characters. Perhaps this uneven film is merely a prelude to more deeply dramatic things to come in the next two movies (although I hear EPISODE II is a snooze). I shall persevere. For the time being, I recommend this film...barely.",1118016000,2,4290,4.753020134228188

657560,5,6303454038,"Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace is how the Star Wars saga began. The way this movie connects to the others is amazing. We see the young Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn. We see the Sith, Darth Sidious and Darth Maul, who revelaed themselve to the Jedi for the first time in a millenia here. We see Palpatine living a double life as the good-hearted Senator from Naboo and as Darth Sidious. We see him manipulate the Senate in order to set his massive plan to take over the Republic into motion. We see the young Anakin Skywalker, who's fate is the evil Darth Vader, but who will eventually bring balance to the Force.

Surely these things are enough to win over the Jar Jar haters. The good things in this movie greatly outweigh the bad. The lightsaber duel is suspensful, the space battle is exciting, the Gungan/Droid battle is amazing, the pod race is suspenseful, the special effects are dazzling, the music is moving and the story is intriguing.

To know the true story of the Star Wars saga as a whole is to accept the Phantom Menace for what the great movie it is.",1117584000,7,1090,4.445
657561,3,6303454038,"This had the potential to be soooo good, and yet, for many loyal fans, it was a letdown.  I remember hearing that they were going to make prequels, and being so excited.  Having been born far too late the see the original theatrical releases of the original triogy, I had to be content with seeing the Special Editions.  When I saw this movie I was 9, so I thought it was really great.  However, now I realize that there were serious problems with this movie.  First, Amidala- she had great style, but compared to  Princess Leia, she was a wimp.  None of the characters from the original seemed to be the same, and some of the new ones were not quite up to par: Jar-Jar- what was up with him? Did we really need him there? Plus,  Anakin struck me as way too innocent for a 9-year-old boy growing up in one of Tatooine's spaceports.  None of the story seemed to have a point, except to have Anakin meet his future wife.  However, there were some good things about it.  First, the special effects were excellent.  Not quite as good as in later Star Wars movies, but excellent.  Second, Darth Maul.  He was the only new addition that seemed worthy of being called Star Wars.  He was nowhere near as good as Darth Vader, but that was because he didn't try to be.  He was his own villian, and it woked perfectly.  I've never seen anyone use a lightsaber like that before, like it was part of him, not just a weapon.  Episode I's lightsaber fight is arguably the best one in all 6 movies.  Other than that, it's not really worth it.  1 star for Darth Maul and the lightsaber fight, one for the special effects, and one simply because it's Star Wars, not that it's worthy of the name",1117497600,,1676,4.327974276527331
657662,3,6303454038,"Okay, folks - settle down. It's not the Second Coming and it's not the end of cinema as we know it. It is a prequel that feels especially dependent on its sequels (made and unmade) for interest.

Set 30 years before the events that unfold in the much-loved STARS WARS trilogy, it chronicles the deprived childhood of Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), who grows up to be Darth Vader, and the travails of teen Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) of Naboo, who must save her planet from destruction while weighed down by a series of brow-burdening headdresses. In Amidala's corner: Jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his cheeky apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), who will, of course, mature into Luke Skywalker's wise mentor. Against her: devilish-looking Darth Maul (Ray Parks), a passel of toad-like aliens who take their marching orders from Maul's hooded boss, and the apparently benevolent Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who must be two-faced scum because he's due to metamorphose somewhere down the line into the Emperor of the evil Empire. There's plenty to look at: The movie's crammed with goofball aliens, futuristic hardware and elaborate costumes, some of them truly stunning in their intricacy. The lumbering banality of the dialogue, ameliorated in places by the efforts of actors like Neeson and McGregor, is painful but hardly unexpected - the trilogy is full of wince-inducers. But it's a bit disturbing that along with the simplistic heroics of old-fashioned space operas, this film has also picked up their unexamined racism: Why, for example, do the duplicitous toad aliens speak and dress like Chinese people? And how did comic-relief Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), a lizard-like creature notable for his affable cowardice, come to sound Rastafarian?

It's a kiddie movie rejiggered for childish grown-ups, of whom there are enough to make it a hit. How such childishness has become a virtual secular religion is hard to imagine, and far beyond the scope of movie criticism.",1117411200,,2003,5.179012345679013

657665,2,6303454038,"This could have been much better. It could have been on par with the original Star Wars. But Lucas @$#%ed it up. He cast the worst possible choice for Anakin and gave him impossibly bad lines (""Now this is podracing!"", ""Yippee!""). And then he made him destroy the bad guys by accident. BY ACCIDENT! The villains died because some 9 year old got trapped in the cockpit of a fighter and didn't know the thrust from the torpedoes. Another mistake goes without mentioning: Jar Jar Binks. Never mind the fact that Lucas sold out, he was just dumb. I thought the whole fight between the Gungans and the Trade Federation was dumb, too.

This movie did have two saving graces, though: Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor. Both were excellent for the roles of Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. The lightsaber duel between them and Darth Maul was brilliant. Also the podracing scene was well done, and the scenes on Coruscant were beautiful (though I could have used without the scene in the Senate chambers).

I noticed one reviewer complained that why the Trade Federation blockaded Naboo was never explained. They did it on the orders of Darth Sidious (or Emperor/Chancellor Palpatine), using the defense that they were protesting the Senate's taxation on trade routes. The whole event was just a brilliant scheme by Palpatine to get elected Supreme Chancellor so later on he could use the clone army (created in Episode II to battle the Seperatists, who he also secretly oversaw) to take over the Republic and become Emperor.

657667,2,6303454038,"I saw this film on theatrical release in and was very disappointed. Of course, alot of the disappointment initially had to do with the incredible hype build-up that accompanied the new trilogy. Nothing could have lived up to the public's expectations.

That having been said, The Phantom Menace is disappointing not so much because it stinks, but because, I felt, with some additional tweaking, it could have been much much better. Its almost as if Lucas got the plot ideas and character concepts developed to a schematic level and then sort of lost interest in them and did not develop them any further.

Specific gripes:

1. We never really bond with or understand Qui-Gon's character or his relationship with young Anakin. He states that he thinks Anakin may be the chosen one, but that is not really sufficient. We need to see an emotional bond or some kind of identification between the two, but it just isn't there.

2. Not to pick on Jake Lloyd (he's probably a great kid), but Lucas or whoever just did not get a good performance out of him. Plus, there is no hint in young Anakin at this point of character traits or flaws that might later foreshadow his fall. Yoda says he sees anger and fear in Anakin and the Jedi Council make vague predications that he may eventually be dangerous, but we as audience members just don't see it. We are supposed to infer that Anakin is somehow damaged by his life as as slave and subsequent separation from his mother, but again, we don't see any of this. His life as a slave doesn't seem to indicate any hardship; his big scene saying goodbye to his mom is not particularly moving (mainly due to wooden acting by Lloyd; Pernilla August as his mom does a good job thought). Also, if he's a slave, how does he have time/resources to build robots and pod racers? Just not very true to life.

Perhaps if we had seen Anakin and/or his mom subjected to some sort of abuse or exploitation we would have a better indication both of the fear and anger in Anakin and also a potential emotional reason for why Qui-Gon wants to rescue Anakin. When I reflected on it, I thought it would almost be better if Anakin were like the feral boy in Road Warrior II: an unkempt, unclean, and agressive character that had to be somewhat tamed and civilized by his Jedi rescuers. We don't see any character flaws, any little hints of selfishness, anger, fear or frustration. As is, young Anakin is just an average cute kid; we don't see any depth to why he wants to escape his life as a slave or run off to join the Jedi so we don't really care.

3. Source of humor: The original series had a mix of humor based upon the droids 3PO and R2D2 and also with the human characters (primarily interactions between Solo, Leia, and Luke). In TPM, the primary source of humor is generated from droids and Jar Jar Binks with little or no humorous banter or interaction between human characters. This has two effects: 1)relying on computer-generated characters for humor means the primary form of humor becomes physical slapstick, which is one of the main complaints about the Jar Jar charcter; and 2)the interactions between the human main characters, when deprived of humor, makes their relationships seem dry and mechanical, another source of the shallow characterizations.

The one humorous moment that stands out is when, after being ambushed by the Trade Feds at the beginning, Obi-Won says to Qui-Gon with a wry smile: ""Well, you were right about one thing Master....the negotiations were short!"" This one moment stands out because it is one of the few jokes between human characters and it works and expresses some of Obi-Won's personality. It also effectively echoes some of the banter and attitude that made Solo's character so liekable and crucial to the original films, an attitude and sensibility that is lacking in TPM. As is, we are stuck with Jar Jar's pratfalls for yuks, and it just doesn't work unless you are 5 years old.

4. The shallowness of Darth Maul: Similar to other problems with character depth, we don't know enough about Maul. He says early in the film that at last he will have revenge on the Jedi. Revenge for what? We never know beyond vague notions that the Sith and Jedi are ancient enemies. That is not enough. We either need to be shown more back story on this or have some reason for Maul's motivation. His fight scenes with the Jedi at the end are dynamite and clearly the actor is very skilled in martial arts and projects a menacing attitude with only minimal dialog or screen time, but we never really know anything about him other than ""he is a bad guy"" and that is not enough.

5. Plot goofiness. As others have pointed out, all the midi-chlorian business is a red herring of mumbo-jumbo that takes the mystical mystery out of the Force and reduces it to a medical condition. The Jedi are supposed to be wise, powerful seers, but them seem oblivious to the presence and intentions of the bad guys over and over again. Having young Anakin build C3PO is silly and seems like a forced ""circle closer"". Further, having Anakin start out on Tatooine doesn't seem right and seems like another circle closer that is forced. Wouldn't he remember all this years later as Darth Vader in Episode 4? Wouldn't there be some result of this coincidence? As noted above, having a slave that doesn't seem to be deprived or suffering and has the time/resources to build robots and pod racers as a hobby seems goofy too.

Again, it seemed to me like Lucas got the plot and characters to a certain point and then quit on them. With only a little extra effort or different emphasis on certain elements, the movie could have been much improved and the audience would have had more insight into the characters and identified with them more. As is, the lack of character development combined with wooden acting makes it hard for the audience to care. The special effects set pieces are spectacular, and the computer generated elements are pioneering and well executed, but without a reason to care about or like the characters, its hard to get too excited.

Again, not a horrid movie, but frustrating because with just a few changes or extra effort, it could have been so much better.

POSTSCRIPT (2011)to my original year 2005 review:

This movie does not get better with time or repeated viewings. Further, the contention of some fans who like this movie and claim it should be viewed in the context of the other films (now complete) is not only a misguided apologist stance, but outright doesn't hold water. Why? Because if you compare TPM to any of the 5 other SW films, it is clearly the idiot bastard son of the bunch, wheezing and drooling in the corner.

In review, I give credence to a theory that a lot of other reviewers have given: in essence, Lucas was boiling everything down in this film to aim at the 5-year-old to 8-year-old demographic (probably to sell toys and mechandise, the real unexpected treasure that the original trilogy coughed up back in the 70's and 80's) and, as a result, bored everyone else to tears and/or made older fans hopping mad. However, huge stretches of this movie are so slow-moving that I bet a lot of the the target audience squirmed around in their seats anyway.

The second theory that other viewers have posed that seems to ring true with me as well is that Lucas is in a position now where he's THE MAN and, as a result, has no one around him that is willing to bring up constructive criticism to him or challenge weaknesses in the plot, script, or characters. Back in the day, while the original SW was certainly his vision, that film had to rely on a far more collaborative process to get made and address the many challenges its making entailed. With TPM, Lucas had total personal control and it seems like no one around Lucas had the guts to say: ""George, we need a good kid actor to play a central character like Anakin, not some cutesy wooden mop-topped kid from TV commericals"" or ""Damn, George, that Jar Jar is irritating as hell!"" or ""George, did you realize all the aliens seem to be stand-ins for offensive real-life planet Earth racial / cultural stereotypes?"" or ""All the scenes with Kabuki-Natalie are boring boring boring"" or ""This movie is all-CGI and no plot and no character depth!"" or ""This movie is full of jumbled-up crap that makes no sense!"". Further, modern movie technology further consolidated control with Lucas in that the 1970's technology required many people's input to solve technical problems and was far less malleable; modern CGI allows Lucas to personally review, tweak, and endlessly revise every aspect of the film just the way he wants it.

In a nutshell, there is a reason that the Irvin Kerschner (R.I.P.)- directed ""Empire"" is widely viewed as the best of the 6 films. How Lucas could see dailies of some of the performances he got out of his actors in TPM and not realize things stank or, at the very least, weren't working is beyond me, unless he was constantly surrounded by lackeys and toadies saying ""That's great, Mr. Lucas! Not explaining anything about Darth Maul makes him sooooo mysterious! Having Jar Jar be a moron who speaks like Stepin Fetchit is really cool! He needs more screen time! You're a genius!"". In retrospect, I wish that Lucas had handed over all the remaining films from ""Return"" all the way thru the newer Pre-Quel trilogy to others with Lucas only having an overall story arc / consulting role.

I know that Lucas is irritated by fans who act as if he ""owes them"" to handle all these movies a certain way (its HIS vision, as I'm sure he'd point out), and maybe it is unfair to whine about how Lucas could have / should have directed the story a different way. But the fact is that TPM is not a very good movie, and regardless of quibbles about overall direction of the story line, Lucas did owe it to fans to at least not make a stinker-roo that not only insults fans above the age of 8, but really tarnishes the legacy from the first trilogy. Lucas seems to think these movies are only for kids now, and has, at least in the case of TPM, clearly targeted them accordingly.

However, while I guess one could argue that adults should only go to see films like ""My Dinner with Andre"" or the oevre of Ingmar Bergman and leave anything less mature and intellectual to the kiddies, the fact is millions and millions of adults went to and enjoyed the first trilogy (and other action-adventure-fantasy films) and it is not unrealistic to expect millions of adults would have some interest in the Pre-Quel trilogy as well. Further, it is not unreasonable to expect those adults would have some expectation that the Pre-Quel trilogy would not only have something worthwhile for grown ups, but would also build and expand upon, in a worthy way, the original trilogy that was so well-liked. Lucas, frankly, dropped the ball on this one; contentions that it should be enough simply because it sprang out of Lucas' mind and vision are not sufficient.

One could even argue that Lucas now has more contempt than anything else for his adult audience and for the fanboys who gripe about things like ""How could he make Greedo shoot first?"" (the big Special Edition tweak that many felt was a poke in the eye.) Lucas seems to go thru great lengths to tweak things that don't need it and then ignores or is oblivious to things that are huge, infected carbuncles staring him right in the face, like crappy dialog, unrealistic plot devices, bad casting, and wooden acting. Its almost as if with TPM he's saying ""Grow up, already! Trix are for kids! Don't forget to buy your kid a Happy Meal with an authorized LucasFilm toy on the way home!""

In short, Lucas seems to be taking his own films far less seriously than his fan base (and probably movie goers in general) does, and it clearly irritates the crap out of him (and/or he doesn't understand it). However, it also irritates the crap out of his fans and the audiences who loved the movies of the original Trilogy and expected more of the TPM. At worst, as some other harsh reviews have pointed out, TPM seems like just another cynical Hollywood-as-usual souless big money cash-in; was it so wrong for fans to expect something more than that? Until TPM, everyone felt that the Star Wars series was somehow different from the myriad of sci-fi / fantasy effects-laden movies (many of them awful; others: naked cash grabs) that its success inspired and spurred from 1977 onwards. The Star Wars series seemed to have a spirit of its own. The reason, whether Lucas understands it or not, for the vitirol spewed about TPM is many fans felt this ""special-ness"" was betrayed or sold short (either out of laziness, sloppiness, ineptitude, or worse, greed).

In short, TPM is a stinker. I surmise that even though he seemed to discount it in the press, Lucas took some of the fan reaction to TPM to heart as he stepped his game up somewhat with (the marginally better) AOTC and certainly with the much better (and darker, natch) ROTS. (Granted, no one is going to think ROTS was directed by Kubrick, but you get my point). Too bad TPM seems, still, like a serious and uncertain mis-step, almost like a rough draft concept that should have been abandoned and re-done from scratch. ""Super Special Edition"" anyone?",1117065600,275,13285,4.642279880901744
657668,4,6303454038,"First I would like to say that Episode's I - III are PREQUELS to IV - VI.  I have read many reviews stating they are disappointed because there was no Darth Vader (James Earl Jones voice)  Attention:  There is no Darth Vader in Episodes I or II because he doesn't EXIST yet!

Also I must get a few things off of my chest before I continue:  1.) Anakin is NOT Luke's son, and 2.) Obi Wan did not come back from the dead and ended up being young again having to train as a Jedi all over again.  3.) C-3PO was not ""rebuilt"" 4.) Anakin does NOT become the ""new"" Darth Vader.

Again these are prequels, meaning they occur BEFORE A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.

Storyline

Obi Wan Kenobi and his Master Qui Jon Jinn are sent to settle a dispute with the Trade Federation.  They are attacked almost immediately but of course escape unharmed.  During the course of the movie these two Jedi cross paths with Queen Amidala who is being forced to sign a treaty that would certainly lead to war.  After Jinn and Kenobi rescue them and escape, their ship is damaged in the process.  They are forced to land on Tatooine to find supplies to repair their ship.  It is here that we meet Anakin Skywalker.  On the outside Anakin seems just like another little boy.  But Jinn sees and senses something in him that no one else has been able to see to this point except for his mother.  Jinn knows almost immediately that Anakin is indeed very special and could become a very powerful ally as a Jedi.  Young Anakin eventually decides to leave Tatooine with Jinn and Kenobi to start Jedi training.  The Jedi council is wary of having Anakin train as a Jedi because they sense that he could very dangerous.

In order to prevent this review from being too long, I will leave the storyline at that, it can get very confusing and it jumps around quite a bit.

To review the actual movie, I really enjoyed it.  Some scenes were better left out and one character in particular should have been left out completely, Jar Jar of course.  While he didn't annoy me quite as much as he did for others, I found him ruining this movie; especially how he accidentally killed those droids.  Had been less clumsy, and goofy, it would have been fine.  I could even put up with his strange voice had it not been for everything else.

Jack Lloyd made a pretty good Anakin, I am glad Lucas choose a little known actor to play this role, mainly because anyone else who was more recognized would have caused viewed to associate that actor with other movies.  A perfect example of this is Mace Windu (played by Samuel MFing Jackson).  While I think Jackson did a great job playing his role, I just found it very hard to associate him with being a Jedi Master.  This is made even worse that he is the only Jedi I noticed that had a purple light saber, drawing even more attention to him.  The most convincing roles in the movie are Jinn and Kenobi.  Kenobi is an old favorite and I related to him almost immediately.  His master Jinn is also a character who is easy to relate to.  He is cool, calm and patient, all of which are traits Jedi's must possess.  He is not scared to do what he believes is right even going against the advice of Master Yoda, Master Windu and the rest of the Jedi Council.  At this point in his life, Obi-Wan is still quite young and does not yet posses the same degree of patience and confidence as his master.  However he does learn very quickly.

There are only two Jedi duels in this movie (One and a half is more like it).  But the final duel is amazing.  Darth Maul's dual light saber has to be the coolest thing ever made.

Though good prevailed in the end of this one, the movie ended in sort of a cliff hanger as Windu and Yoda were still trying to determine who the Sith Lord was.

If you take the movie for what it is, then there really isn't more that can be expected from this movie.  While I can certainly accept people just not liking the movie, what I have a problem with, is people who rip this movie just because they don't understand it.  If you understand what is going on and you don't like the movie than that is fine.  You understand the movie enough to form an honest opinion about it.  Example, The previous review ""Hank (The Hammer)"" wrote an excellent review explaining why he didn't really like the movie.  He understands the story but just didn't like it.

Others however write bad reviews just because they don't understand the story. Do not give this movie a bad review just because you don't get the plot or storyline, hoping that somehow characters that didn't even exist yet were in it, saying there were too much politics, or too many ""new"" characters.  If this is the case then you need to go back and re-watch it and understand it before reviewing it.

The politics in this movie while a bit boring in some parts, really could not be avoided as it was necessary in order to show how the Empire and the Rebellion came to be.  I think Lucas did a brilliant job in telling this story, showing how things were before the Emperor took over, and also showing how Anakin Skywalker was discovered and that he wasn't always evil.",1117065600,3,5166,4.358115183246073
657669,3,6303454038,"For only the legions of serious Star Wars fans do I write. I am only going to discuss my feelings about this movie. The DVD in itself is fine with all the extras and deleted scenes, it's quite fascinating really but it's unfortunately not Star Warsesque for me. We all were very excited about episode 1 when it came out in 1999,it was the most anticipated movie in history,16 years after episode 6, a storyline taking place 32 years before episode 4. And in this lies the dilemma. The backstory, we know automatically that certain characters won't exist yet. Luke,Han,Leia,Chewie,Darth Vader,the imperial stormtroopers,Lando,Boba Fett, there's no rebellion against an evil galactic Empire,there's no Millenium Falcon or Tie fighters or X-wings,the wisdom of Yoda when he was on Dagobah,the great comraderie of the lovable droid duo R2-D2 and C3PO.If one looks for all of these characters one will sourly be dissapointed and furthermore comparing characters from the classic to this is no contest. Luke or Anakin,  Darth Vader or Darth Maul, Chewbacca or Jar Jar Binks, Leia or Padme, Old Obi-Wan or young Obi-Wan, artoo and threepio of the trilogy or of the prequel plus no Han for anybody to match up. The Classic Trilogy wins hands down. but most essentially what the Phantom Menace lacked was an EDGE.How many people can honestly say that they despised the villainous Darth Maul,most likely nobody,especially that I know of,however in episode 4 within just a little under 40 minutes Darth Vader without needing to wield a lightsaber made us fear and hate him. He was THE EDGE to Star Wars. When I used the word despise I'm using it reverently in the sense of a character you love to hate. A truly dark character. Darth Maul desperately needed to wield his lightsaber in episode 1 just to emphasize that his character had some sort of personality. What was disapointing about Maul was how he was underutilized by Lucas. We know that Palpatine was Sidious, there never was any mystique about that,we know he used the Trade Federation to catapult himself to become Supreme Chancellor with the help of his Queen's vote of no confidence in Valorum's leadership and therefore after earning a nomination to succeed Valorum he would ultimately earn a sympathy vote by the senate and became the new Chancellor.

 The Phantom was not a very complicated story as people intend it to be, it's a rather simple story what, that I daresay never needed or even deserved to be given the royal treatment as a two hour feature. It's how the future Emperor ascends to power and in doing so indirectly results with the discovery of the slave boy who will one day become the dark lord of the Sith Darth Vader. Palpatine,Valorum,Qui-Gon,and Obi-Wan, are factors that lead to his discovery and Darth Maul and the duel of fates that will contibute to skywalker's descend from the light. Obi-Wan becomes a Jedi knight and Anakin first meets his true love padme(his future bride and mother of Luke and Leia). That's episode 1 in a nutshell. That could have been told in ten minutes flat. What isn't explained at all is why  the Trade federation blockaded Naboo in the first place. Obviously we know that Sidious forced them into it in what he was seeking but what the heck were they supposed to get out of it. The prologue states that the taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute , most people say what?! What does that mean? I'm lost already. The Trade federation is upset about the taxing of routes that they use for traveling, equivalent say to being charged 65 bucks by your homestate for using your local highways

and expressways that they never did but are now doing. If it was explained in episode 1 that Palpatine led a committee in the senate levying severe taxes for years and years and crippling the trade industry it might just be plausible enough to understand that, now we all understand why they're blockading Palpatine's Queen's planet of Naboo, it's a direct opposal against Palpatine's cruelty with heavy taxes of legislation against the Trade Feraration. Now they're enraged to a boiling point and have taken severe action.  UNFORTUNATELY WE NEVER LEARN OF ANY EXPLANATION OF WHY THEY BLOCKADE THE PLANET.WHERE JUST SUPPOSED TO SIMPLY ACCEPT THAT THEY ARE. We know that Jar Jar Binks was a dope, if he had been exiled because he challenged authority and was considered a threat to Boss Nass and his control it just may have worked. Not because he was clumsly. If he was a strongly muscled creature with a tough voice and no nonsensed he would have been a very affable

 character. Natalie Portman was kind of like an enigma, she was good as the Queen but wooden and unappealing as padme. You just couldn't feel her character. Ewan's a talented actor so they say but you learn nothing about Obi-Wan from him his performance. Not to say it's entirely his fault,it's the writing and direction by Lucas in this one, now in episode 4 Sir Alec Guiness was brilliant, watching him perform, you could feel the force. His Obi-Wan was a link to the past. We only know Obi-Wan from him. Jake Lloyd a kid playing Anakin?He wasn't good. You needed someone in my opinion that was a little older, Anakin should have been portrayed as teenager around 17. And he creates C3PO? NO WAY. That's cheesy. Now when I watch Empire and see Han get frozen in carbonite In that great and powerful scene and observe Vader brooding amidst the smoke and witness C3PO strapped to chewie's back I shudder to think that's his former creator over there when Darth was a young kid ANI .Please! I know a lot of people liked the pod race but I felt that it lessoned the seriousness of the Queen's plight. All these silly and goofy looking aliens racing in pods. Gimme a brake. The jedi council was weak, it had the makings to be something cool but we only hear from Yoda And Mace Windu and conehead Ki-Adi Mundi. Why bother even having the rest. Could you imagine those actors, yeah I was in episode 1 the Jedi Temple I was one of the Jedi Masters who just sat there, you barely saw me I hope they give me a line in the next movie if my character makes the cut which some of them didn't. In the trilogy you had Yoda and Kenobi, now you get a plethora of Jedi and it's not exciting, because they're just sitting there in comatose states. Give me a good blaster any day. When a Sith is revealed, a stir is not caused, what would have been cool is for Anakin to ask Qui-Gon""what was that?""And Qui-Gon would have responded by telling Anakin about the history of the Sith. And in a magnificent flashback the firt one and most likely only one ever to be used. This would be the EDGE. How about it an intro to the planet Sith many Sith warriors fighting Jedi and each other. That would have been excellent. The battle droids were were stupidly designed,a stiff wind looks as if it could knock a battle droid of its feet. I will admit that the Droidekas(destroyer droids) were cool. ultimately the ruination of episode 1 was the weakness of characterization,horrible writing,lackluster characters without any depth. No substance. Unlike the trilogy I never felt anything for these characters. All in all I gave it 3 out 5 stars not to be cruel but also not to be kind. Mainly because there was no passion or great emotion from the actors,the acting was ridiculously wooden. I love balance between drama and action. Never the lopsidedness of one over the other.",1116979200,3,7434,4.678134556574924

The comic-relief buffoon Jar Jar Binks is so annoying, he completely overrides whatever is good about this overlong, very boring film.  Unfortunately, if you are a Star Wars fan, it's pretty hard to avoid this movie and just jump straight ahead to the next episode.

As a fan of the Star Wars trilogy of the 70s it answers a lot of the question I've had espically about Darth Vador, he and Yoda were always my favorite characters. (I haven't seen Phantom Menace unfortunately.)

  It is beyond question that any Star Wars fan will love the new three prequels. The special effects are just phenominal. You almost can't really tell that most of the settings in the movies are computer generated rather sets that actually have to spend lots and lots of time building by hand.

657714,3,6303454038,"Hopefully those of you have enjoyed my reviews of various cds and the Invader Zim volumes will be drawn to this six part review of probably the greatest story ever placed on the big screen. In 1999 we Star Wars fans were finally brought to the very beginning of the grand story that George Lucas created almost 30 years ago. We were given the origins of the true main character Anakin Skywalker, the profited chosen one the Jedi said would bring balance to the Force and destroy the dark side once and for all. It is not the best piece of the story, but not being one of those truly obsessed fans one has to realize that in a grand tale you always have to begin somewhere and an introduction will be a bit dull and a bit boring because it is not going to give the watcher what he or she wants. That piece is the climax to this story, which would not be seen until 2005.

All and all the movie is fun to watch. The characters are well put together, even though the dialogue is a bit gut wrenching, but hey Lucas was never one to focus on characters. The casting for all the roles were very well chosen and yes I am a supporter of Jar Jar Binks. Although many obsesses will wish for his death he is an essential part to the story and that is revealed in the end of this film where two races of one planet unite to oppose a threat.

I feel that Lucas did a great job beginning his space epic and putting all the characters into place so that they will end up where they should be in the very last chapter of the saga. 'The Phantom Menace' is fun to watch the characters are surely memorable and let's face it.... the Pod Race was pretty cool. I give this film 3 stars just based on the fact that this is just a huge tease for what is yet to come and that even though there is no sign of Anakin linked to Darth Vader as of yet its still great to see that he was born into that galaxy far far away as an innocent boy not knowing where his adventures would take him.

657768,1,6303454038,"I remember when this movie came out because it was arguably the best theater experience in my life. For months the hype had been building to a fever pitch, as me and my friends battled in the front yard with light-sabers, played the soundtracks constantly, read the Star Wars books, downloaded the trailers, and talked ENDLESSLY in speculation. And what with the media hype and advertising campaigns... well you get the idea. Then of course there was the opening night.

I waited in line for hours for a good seat, and that's only because my friends had been waiting in line for me since around 6:00 AM. When the people in from the previous showing came out there were cheers and screams so loud you couldn't hear yourself think (and earlier in the day my friends made the cover a newspaper with their cheering and cardboard sign holding {honk if you love Star Wars!}). When at last I finally got IN, the theater was packed with something like 300 people who were clapping their hands and stamping their feet BEFORE the movie started. I was so blown by the visuals (special effects), sound editing, fight scenes ect. that I saw the movie ELEVEN times in the theater!

Then my enthusiasm lessoned. I figured out what everyone meant when they talked about the wooden acting (the kid who plays Anakin is the worst, but the Queen is pretty bad too), bad dialog (Jar Jar is so bad it hurts my head), and a THIN plot. Above all, this film is badly directed. Scenes that could be cool instead feel forced, and lifeless. Every moment in the film is loaded with eye-candy, and eventually you may figure out (as I did) that without the eye-candy, there is NOTHING HAPPENING 90% of the time. No intrigue, no character development, nothing.

Of course almost every film has its good points. I'll say it again, AWESOME visuals. Sweet sound edited and not a bad sountrack (duel of the fates was sweet, no arguements there). Our new Obi-Wan was easily the best thing about the movie, and was totally believable in the role. Old senator Palpatine's manuevering and manipulating is great stuff. And Darth Maul, the guy with like two lines and only one purpose in the film (look evil, look scarey, try to kill the good guys, impress the audience, die) puts up one heck of a cool fight against our two jedi at the end of the film. Oh, and the fight choreography is sweet too, with the jedi knights slicing through droids like a hot knife through melting butter. But that does NOT a good movie make.

This movie is a must have on one condition. If you have a great sound system and a huge high-def TV the sweet visuals and sound edits will definitely please as far as picture and sound tests go. Just go straight to one of the battle scenes (or my favorite, the pod race), and crank up the volume. Nice.

At any rate, there are people who will love anything with the Star Wars name plastered on it no matter WHAT it is. This is one of those things. Personally I thought both of the prequels have been incredible disappointments compared to what they coulde have been. If you want more Star Wars and you're a serious fan, read some of the expanded universe books, play Knights of the Old Republic or one of the Jedi Knight games, or watch the excellent Clone Wars cartoons released by Cartoon Network. Just don't watch this one expecting greatness. It is not there.",1116201600,15,3344,4.538971807628524
657769,4,6303454038,"When I first saw this movie I was very disappointed. In preperation for Revenge of the Sith, I watched Episode I & 2 this past weekend. For some reason it was an entirely different movie. I think it's actually on par the Episode 4-6. The story is stronger than in Episode 4-6. We have more character development and the action does not let us down.

Yes, Jar Jar may still be the most reviled character in movie history, but on a smaller screen it's not as bad as in the theatres. Is the acting wooden at time? Yes, but this is Star Wars after all.

Qui-Gon Jinn is the strongest character and perhaps the best Jedi

in all films. He a character of integrity and strength. He always

stand up for what is right opposed to the obeying every strict or

unreasonable order from the Jedi council. He sets the standard for Jedi.

For many that hated Episode, I feel they're jaded and cynical and for those that think this movie is the best movie ever, they are disillusioned. This is an entertaining movie that deserves a second chance.",1116201600,,1031,4.428571428571429
657770,4,6303454038,"The first episode of galactic saga series finally saw the light of day as the fourth Star Wars release in 1998. Previously only the fourth to sixth of the nine-episode series, THE NEW HOPE, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and THE RETURN OF JEDI respectively, had been produced during late 70s to early 80s.

Lucas hired some Eastern philosophy element as the core theme of the story, influenced in large part by the samurai movies of AKIRA KUROSAWA. Yoda, zen-master-like character seems to be the very prototype of Miyagi-san in Karate-Kid movies. Jediism is the galactic adaptation of Bushido, the way of samurai. Also Japanese comics such as Star Blazers and Captain Harlock seemed to have given impetus to complete the setting for the movie. For example Han Solo reminds me of Captain Harlock the galactic pirate. And vivid fighting scenes of Star Blazers. (Both comics were early 70s masterpiece by Leiji Matsumoto).

I was the bit skeptic on how the story of Darth Vader's youth could become such an entertaining movies because it would be filled with sadness, hopelessness and darkness. Now that I have seen the finished movies of the episide I and II, my anxieties faded. Part of the reasons may be that Lucas himself become mature enough to describe the development of the dark side. Also the advancement of technology gave the crew the more agility to create the scenes beyond reach during 70s.

The villain Darth Maul does not have so much apprearance but he is so splendidly perfect foe. His movement is so glaceful and does not seem to rely on stunts.

Anakin boy also is well charactered so that the viewer sense some slight shade in the Jedi-elect boy's mind.

It is no dougt the nice start for the galactic saga.

Verdict: A boy named Ani who later would become a you-know-who.

to everyone who shot this movie down ask yourself, ""Could I really have done this better?""  and the answer would be ""HELL NO"".  It's not like you can just throw Carie Fisher, Harrison Ford, or Mark Hammil back in this movie.  I couldn't imagine how difficult it would be to make a prequel to star wars 15 years after the original so give the man (George Lucas) some respect.

Yes, after watching Episode 1 and wondering how he could ruin the series by putting this out, it's still needed to finish the story.  The actors suck for the most part (at least Padme is hot), the story sucks, the movie itself is rather boring, and you just want to strangle Jar Jar Binks beyond death.

657773,1,6303454038,"The year was 1999 and i was 14. I had been anxiously awaiting for this movie to come out in theaters. I even remember once buying a ticket to get into the movie just to see the trailer for Episode 1 ""The Phantom Menace"" and then leave. The hype for this movie was in full swing, i saw all of the commotion on the TV and the newspapers, fans all over the country camping out side of movie theaters to crazed fans dressed up as their favorite SW character. When the day finally came and saw it, i was horrified. It was esentially a giant cartoon with ""STAR WARS"" plastered on it, i felt sick, it was the biggest letdown in my life. I can't go into everything that was just completely and utterly wrong with this movie, the list would be too long, although i feel compelled to mention a few of them anyway. With episode 3 looming near us, it reminded me of when i first saw episode 1 in thearters and almost cried when i left the venue, thinking that the immortal STAR WARS franchise was going to die if the episode 2 was going to be this bad, and 3 years later in may of 2002, to my horror, it was even worse then the first. when i think of these new prequils, down fall of a legacy comes to mind, how something as great as STAR WARS could be reduced to absolute crap with these prequils. Where do i begin? The first thing is that you essentialy have no acting in here, what made the original great was you hade characters you actually cared about, and most of all you had a defined villian, not this Darth Maul fag who looked like a guy pulled out of a B sci fi flick and had about 6 minutes of screen time. Another thing that REALLY killed me was Jake Loyde... i know he is a little kid, but C'MON! YIPEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF!? Liam Neeson's character could of  been developed a lot more, but Lucas failed at that as well. The most bogus thing was the whole mediclorian blood count thing,a way to measure how attuned to the force a human being is, in other words, how powerful they are. I can't tell you how utterly retarded that concept was, as originaly, the force was supposed a spiritual aspect that was mastered through training and disiplin, not a effing genetic predisposition, this is STAR WARS, not Dragon Ball Z! LET ME CHECK YOU POWER LEVEL VEGETA! WHOA! MY SCOUTER JUST EXPLODED FROM YOUR AWESOME INCREASE IN POWER! The pod race was equaly bad, just imagine NASCAR, only 1000 times worse with a certain comedy vaule to it, which brings me to another point; this movie is more likely going to make you p i $ $ yourself laughing then actually make you take it seriously. Jar Jar alone would of ruined this movie, never mind the acting, or the fact that this is simply one of the worst movies ever made. This movie was what started the wound in the STARWARS franchise, Epiosode 2 was the infection, who knows how bad 3 will be, because they have become progressivly worse, maybe it will be simular to the doctor telling you that your HIV positive.

As i said in another STAR WARS review, these movies can only be enjoyed if you look at them from a pure comedic aspect instead of actually thinking of it as a serious installment in the STAR WARS fracchise.",1115769600,10,3164,4.315966386554622

In fact, when it first came out on DVD, I didn't even want to own it. The worst part of movie for me was the overlong Podrace, while a great special effects masterpiece, it really broke away from the main plotline.

I beg to differ with those who do not buy the idea of the sense of the Force being an inherited ability; if they will recall towards the end of Episode IV, when Luke is trying to blow up the Deathstar, Vader says he feels the force is strong in him.  Since we all know that Luke is Vader's son, then we must conclude that he inhereted his sensativity to the Force.

As to the character of Jar Jar, I found him rather funny.

The acting for the most part was pretty good. I loved Ewan McGregor as the young Obi-Wan and I have always liked Liam Neeson. He played the part of a Jedi Master very well.

Maybe you have to look at this movie as part of the whole series to appreciate where Lucas is going with it.  Watch Episode II and you might like this movie a little more.",1114214400,2,1118,4.148148148148148

There's no acting in the movie, its called reading script and waiting for cue. (SIGH) what people call movies these days is quite depressing.

The movie starts out just like every other one starts out, with the ship floating through space. Come one Lucas! Think of something completely new! We would thank you for it. Then for them on the movie rapidly progresses on a downward slump of bad movie making. Ben Kenobie is frankly a disapointment, he's a silent rather punkish hunk that can't act worth his life. And his Jedi Master is even worse. I have no clue on how his name is spelled, so I'm not even going to try, all I know that it just wasn't star warish. More kiddish than anything.

Then the aliens get rather dumb, whats with the stupid long-eared one that can't speak, and lives in a city that is supposed to be hidden, but anyone with half a clue where it could be. Would be able to find in the space of five minutes. So much for hidden.

Instead, I wanted consumers to be aware of the unfortunate fact that the behind-the-scenes documentary was filled with partially-deleted expletives by production crew and principle actors.

This kind of thing would normally not bother me.  However, if it were not for the fact this movie has been rated PG and has gone to obvious lengths to target younger audiences I wouldn't raise a concern.  There was some attempt to audibly blank most of the offensive language out, however the efforts fell very short and even missed a couple of F-bombs.

The production quality of the behind-the-scenes documentary was also lack luster... of course I may have been spoiled after watching the endless hours of Peter Jackson's behind-the-scenes of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The 17 web featurettes are very well edited on the other hand, and were among my favorite of the special features to watch.  However, it would have been nice to have a ""Play All"" feature.

I would have given this movie 4 stars, but I'm forced to give the overall product 3 stars due to the poor editing of the main special feature.",1113177600,,1264,4.761467889908257
657883,1,6303454038,"Okay, let's be honest with one another -- this movie is tragic.

I'm going to summarize my disdain for this movie by making one point and one point only.  The ""midi-clorians"", this has to be the saddest thing I've ever heard.  No longer can a kid playing Star Wars in his back forest become a Jedi in his mind and soul by making a personal commitment to honour and truth and chivalry -- like any knight in history, both European or far Eastern or wherever -- but by having a certain genetic predestination alone.  You see, as Qui-Gon tells us plain and simple, Force sensitivity is hereditary; it's in all of us, but in some more than others.  We can assume from Obi-Wan's astonishment at Anakin Skywalker's midi-chlorian count -- ""Not even Master Yoda has a count that high!"" -- that Force sensitivity is proportional to the quantity of midi-chlorians found in one's cells.  I can't begin to tell you how awful that sounds to me.  People are no longer on a level playing field; equal under the Force.  The Force (read God) is perfection, and some are evidently now closer to perfection than others as a fact of nature.  This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of, and has destroyed the magic that was Star Wars forever.  Star Wars ruled because it touched each of us as kids at a spiritual level, whether we realized it or not.  Each of us were Luke Skywalker standing on Tatooine gazing up at the stars wondering, hoping, wishing of what will become of ourselves.  ""Owp, hold on kid, let me check your blood-type.  Hmm, so sorry, but it seems you are not of the Jedi race.""  ""But, Jedi is not a race, it's a way of being, it's about goodness and virtue and all that and any kid can be a Jedi, no matter where he or she is from or what he or she looks like.""  ""Well, part of that is right.  It doesn't matter where you are from or what you look like, but it does matter if you have the right blood or not.  For you see my worthless little friend, some people are lesser than others, and you are barely registering on the scale.  Being a Jedi is not an individual quest, either you are born Jedi material or you ain't.  And you ain't.""

Hogwash.  Like the rest of people in the free world, I grew up playing Star Wars and my childhood was a lot more happier because of it.  I had friends back then as a small child whom I haven't seen or talked to in a long long time, but if I remember them at all I know they wouldn't stand for this baloney.  If I could build a time machine and go back to the Hoth that was Ontario in January and stop the Star Wars game that was going on in the street by all us kids and say ""hey, wait a minute, have you guys heard about this midi-chlorians thing?  Where some of us are Jedi worthy by natural predestination and the rest are, well, nothing??""  The kids just wouldn't have stood for that, I can tell you for certain.  And why should they stand for it??

While admitting the movie was entertaining, there are some issues that must be addressed. Much of the casting was poorly done (for example, Natalie Portman was at her wormiest as Princess Amidala, and Amidala's captain of the guard was a total ham), the script was often cheesy (i.e. ""are you an angel?..."") and the character development (or perhaps the actors skills) lacked the strength needed to portray deep conflicts of soul and ethics. Many of the CG characters, notably the villians of the trade federation were obnoxious and cutesy (as was jar-jar).

657889,5,6303454038,"This is a wonderful film, and the best judges of it are my kids.  They have watched this - and forced me to watch it with them - at least 10 times in the last few weeks.  I really like the characters in it and find all sorts of subtleties, many of them precedents to the later masterful trilogy.

I don't know why people are so critical of this, unless they wanted more of the same from the first trilogy.  That would be boring if you ask me:  this is a different world complete with a crumbling political order and the latent seeds of destruction and chaos, leading directly into the themes that are so rich in the original Lucas production.  Indeed, these themes are deepened here with new details that are left for interpretation.

Moreover, the story is extremely dense with details that can live in the imagination.  For example, while we know Aniken becomes Darth Vader, his relationship with Qui-Gon is such that if he, rather than Obi-Wan became his mentor/master, his future might have been very different.  That is fate, but also incredible richness in character and theme.  You can get into all of that if you are so inclined, which as a scifi lover I am.

It is a matter of taste, of course.  I think this is truly brilliant sci-fi, with wonderful values that beg for thoughtful interpretation.  It teaches kids a lot, too, about loyalty, ambition, and even politics.  I simply love it all.

657890,5,6303454038,"I, like many people, think that this movie has unfairly gotten a very bad reputation.  I believe that because Episode II was admittedly not that great, that it has overshadowed Episode I as well.  I personally think that while Jake Lloyd was only the first bad actor to play Anakin, the rest of the acting in the movie was very good.  Natalie Portman, as a queen, was not supposed to sound ""human.""  She was supposed to sound stiff!  But I think the best acting comes from Palpatine, and from the two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi.  I was very sad when Qui-Gon died, and felt that he could've proved a valuable character in the subsequent movies.  Darth Maul, I felt, also died too soon.  He showed himself to be a much better Dark Jedi than stupid Dooku, and could've been a good final opponent for Anakin before becoming Palpatine's apprentice.  But I'm also a believer in George Lucas.  I think that any decisions he made, he made them with the other movies in mind.  But I wish I could travel back in time and tell him not to direct it.  And to kill Jar-Jar.  But I think I'm just dreaming.",1111017600,3,1110,4.435643564356436
657891,5,6303454038,":-)

I have read the reviews on line here at Amazon.com about ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,"" some I agree with, others I don't. I remember when this movie was in the theaters, in fact at the theater I was at, I was the very first person in line to purchase my tickets and I purchased two tickets each for the first three showings of this movie for myself and my date. Both she and I agree that this was worthy of the title of ""Star Wars"" and we also both agree had Mr. Lucas stayed as writer & executive producer that the movie would have been even better.

George Lucas is a great storyteller, creating great characters and a great adventure to watch those characters grow within the film, but he is no director. As I have viewed many of the movies Lucas has directed, from ""THX 1138,"" ""American Graffiti,"" ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,"" and ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,"" and it became apparent to me that Lucas is no director as his camera angles are trivial and not very imaginative - much different from the collaboration between he and Steven Spielberg in the ""Indiana Jones"" movies. That collaboration really works and I bet had Lucas asked Spielberg to direct his saga he would have agreed - after all Spielberg is directing ""Indiana Jones 4"" as he did all the pervious ""Indiana Jones"" movies. Still this was a magnificent movie.

I would not have used Jake Lloyd, but with Lucas' knowledge of the character Lloyd does manage to pull it off - barely. I was sorry to see Qui-Gon die, however I do see it as being necessary for Obi-Wan to move from Padawan to Jedi Knight, and I was disappointed that Darth Maul was killed off as well though that also was necessary since the focal point of evil is not Darth Maul, but he who becomes the Emperor. I am disturbed however that there is no mention of Yoda being ""the Jedi Master who instructed me!"" as Obi-Wan said in ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back."" Maybe Lucas will make mention of the in ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" as it was slightly eluded to in ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones.""

I purchased both the VHS and the DVD versions and in the VHS there really is nothing very special that is different, from the theatrical release. The DVD release however not only has deleted scenes, but also has incorporated some extra scenes and extended scenes into the DVD release, however Mr. Lucas if you are reading, a release with certain deleted scenes would be nice to be incorporated into the movie itself, or like the ""X-Men"" DVD did, allow people to make the decision to add the deleted scenes by electing to select that option. Scenes that I would like to see included are ""The Waterfall Sequence,"" ""Dawn Before the Race,"" ""Anakin's Scuffle with Greedo,"" and ""Farewell to Jira.""

Anyway I have heard the complaints about this movie, however remember this is a prequel and as such it is bound to be less suspenseful as we do know what happens in the end. However what I like most about this movie is that we finally get to see more than just a single Jedi. I also loved the two edged lightsaber and would love to see that show up again in ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith.""

Jar Jar Binks may be a bit annoying at times, but his character is necessary to this and future chapters of the saga plus he adds a morality message as the Gungans are forced to accept the other race on the planet Naboo in order to work together to defeat a common enemy.

I have heard complaints about the virgin birth of Anakin with Christian groups protesting since only Messiah Himself should be from a virgin birth, but what these Christians fail to realize is that Anakin & Shmi Skywalker come from ""a galaxy far, far away"" and are not human by our standards but rather are humanoid - a human like species, plus that even here on Earth we have creatures that on a regular basis are born through ""virgin"" births, which the scientific community has dubbed asexual reproduction, so why can't an alien from another planet. We see the exterior appearance of this species, not their anatomy. One need only refer to many aliens from other shows that appear human to us to see that what one can conceive can be created in a fictional character. In ""Doctor Who,"" one of the oldest sci-fi shows we learn that Gallifreyans, which look completely human, have two hearts, live for hundreds of years and when they die their cells reform to bring them back from the dead. In ""Star Trek"" the characters of Guinan and Deanna Troi clearly look human and clearly are not and on ""Babylon 5"" the Centauri clearly look human with very bad hair styles (does that mean Padm Amidala and her daughter Leia Organa are Centauri?), but they also have two hearts - a primary heart & a secondary heart. There is precedent through many different sci-fi shows that aliens can look human but not be human.

Most of the backgrounds were digitally, not physically, made and really made their locations very exotic and the digitized characters were very, very cool. Most of the vehicles though did not have that rustic feel and they did in the original trilogy, these vehicles looked too new for a ""Star Wars"" movie. The Trade Federation is a good analogy of how corporations can get out of control, just as the Senate of the Republic does for government. Seeing the Jedi council was cool and how they test for users of the Force and the final battle seen was reminiscent of ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" final battle with the three prong effect of a lightsaber dual, a massive ground war of low tech versus high tech and the space battle against other starships and a powerfully shielded space vessel. And I loved seeing the subtle influence of the Dark Side of the Force in Anakin & Palpatine, and the developing bond between the two.

All in all this was a great movie, though I must also admit that all the other ""Star Wars"" movies with Anakin/Vader were better than this one (that means that the ""Ewok"" movies and cartoon show, the ""Droids"" cartoon show and ""The Star Wars Holiday Special"" were not as good as this movie.",1110931200,3,6137,4.482110912343471

What George Lucas is doing is practicing a brand new concept in the movies known as ""art imitates life"". Star Wars is a generational film in a sense that it is giving us an image of the same family in different times in history. No, you will not the swaggering Han Solo making his wonderful one liners, or Luke saving the day with his light saber. The characters weren't born yet. Darth Vader was only a child at this time.

A wonderful analogy is a family tree. Let's say you can travel back in time to the 1940s. You will not find yourself there or the people you know. You will find your grandparents or parents as teenagers or as young children along with a population that would be totally unrecognizable. The political situations would be totally different, the villains would be different, and even the general way of thinking among the people would be different. It is your world, but it would not be your world.

This situation, when viewed on the movie screen, would bother many, many people which would make the movie hard to adjust to.

OK! Some things on the movie could have been better. Jar Jar Binks could have been a LOT less aggravating than he was. Yes, there could have been just a bit LESS talk at the political conferences and more action.

Still, there were wonderful highlights. It was very refreshing to see Jabba the Hutt again along with the great race. The creatures who were to be the competitors were hilarious.

Ian McDiarmid was back, playing a dual role as both Darth Sidius and Palpatine, the human would LATER become the evil emporer. Although McDiarmid looked too human this time he still had the wonderful wit of the emperor and was enjoyable to see.

All in all, it is a wonderful movie to see to look for memorable characters and to view the Star Wars' parallel universe that we wanted to know about in the original trilogy.",1110758400,8,2080,4.530666666666667

This movie introduces anakin, we get to see that he has a temper, we get to see the young obi wan and the jedi temple and council that gets mentioned in the later episodes.

And to the idiot who says that ALL jedi vanish is just crap the old obi wan is the ONLY jedi to do that, the reason this movie is lighter in content is to coinside with obi wan's remard in a new hope when he tells luke "" there was a time of peace , before the dark times, before the empire"" if you just watch the movies it all makes sense.

You have to remember in this movie the sith are thought to be extinct by the jedi, other than that everything was peaceful . If you have seen all the movies your gonna have a big grim on your face when Palpatine tells young Anakin ""we will be watching your career with great interest"" that was by far the greatest line so far in the trilogy.

Other than that i luved the jedi sith fights , i finally got to see them in their hayday fighting in out , other than that only you only hear about the way they fought when obi wan told luke,or when luke was seen fighting vader , or obi wan fighting vader but now you get to see a sith warrior and how deadly they are .

Return of the Jedi was always the problem child for me. It was replaced when this one came out. Once again the effects are breathtaking, but it has several obvious weak points. We should have met Skywalker at a later age. Jar jar is completely useless. My favorite peev though is the point where Skywalker destroys the control ship and say's ""Now this is pod racing!"". I can never help myself but to respond with ""No, this is warfare and many people have just died!""

However, within the storyline George has laid out, this film does what it sets out to do. And there are moments of brilliance. The podrace and the duel are worth price of admission alone. If we did not know what was going to happen in future segments of the story it would all be very mysterious (I plan to make my grandchildren watch them in correct order!)

Overall, I would say that the rabid negative reactions many had towards this installment were tad over done. After all, even the worst Star Wars movie is still much better than the majority of stuff we get. George has created a whole galaxy for us to explore, unlike LOTR where existing mythology was just pasted together in a new format. I enjoyed Episode 2 and have high expectations for Episode 3.

There are people rating this four and five stars, but their review contains nothing but digs at every aspect of the film, excluding the visual effects. People spending hundreds of words to say why the movie is bad, then turning around and saying they loved it, and proclaiming it ""100% Star Wars."" This was NOT Star Wars. Seeing this in the theater was like being in a bad dream. I'd wanted to see the prequels for so long, and was utterly let down in every way. The idiotic introduction of ""midi-chlorians"" stomped all over the spiritual aspect of the originals...that mastery of the force was all about spiritual and mental focus, and belief. Now it's just about how many of the right cells you've got. Ridiculous. I could go on ad infinitum about Jar Jar Binks, the worst character ever introduced in film, but that's been done to death. Jake Lloyd has already taken his lumps for his awful performance, as have others...so I won't belabor that point, either.

The fact is, the characters of the original trilogy are icons for a reason - you CARED about them. We don't care about any of the characters in the prequel trilogy - they are all completely disposable. We know what becomes of everyone of significance in the story, the rest of the characters are one-dimensional and unimportant. The Jedi Council is a rogues gallery of makeup artists at work, but not a single one will be remembered...let alone acheive iconic status. Shouldn't they have made more of an impact on us than the characters in Jabba's palace, who we only saw for a few minutes? In fact, who still cares about Darth Maul? Nobody. He was a microcosm of these prequels - all flash, no substance. I was bitterly disappointed by both the two prequel movies and I'm praying for a small amount of redemption in the third, but I feel Lucas has lost his way and is now only good at putting effects on-screen...which is more a testament to the talented staff of ILM than anything. But the long line of digital characters rolled out by his effects company do nothing to match the simple, rubber-mask charm of Greedo or the denizens of Mos Eisley Cantina...just as none of his main characters can hold a candle to the charisma and charm of Han Solo.

In twenty years, nobody will be talking about the prequel films. No future filmmakers will hold them up as the movies that inspired their career choice. They are disposable entertainment for an audience that has apparently become so easily amused that ANYTHING is passable, as long as their eyeballs are entertained by ""great graphics.""

Jake Lloyd (the kid who played Anakin) cannot act to save his life, therefore the film suffers with the scenes he's in.

Why do you have an animal pulling something that can levitate, they can figure out how to levitate something but they can't figure out how to move it from point A to point B?

658012,1,6303454038,"Considering the money, cast, and producers behind it, the Phantom Menace is possibly the worst movie ever made.  Even the title is confusing.  It's almost like they just chose a title that sounded cool and threw it on.  It doesn't mean anything.  What exactly is the phantom menace?  Who is the phantom menace?  Is it Darth Maul, a character we see for about five minutes before he's killed?  Come on.  How terrible.  How cheap.  Do they really think we're that stupid?

658013,4,6303454038,"My feeling about what detracts from episode I when compared with episodes IV-VI is that there isn't a central character that we can identify with fully enough.  In episode IV-VI, we have a pivotal moment at the end of each movie: Luke has faith in the Force and destroys Death Star, Luke discovers Vader is his father, Luke defeats the Emperor by refusing to give into the dark side when he had the advantage over his father.  In episode I we have a pivotal moment in the battle between Obi Wan and Darth Maul.  But this moment doesn't carry the emotional impact that the similar moment did in the other three movies.

Obi Wan Kenobi should be the Luke Skywalker for the first three episodes.  We don't develop an emotional understanding of Obi Wan Kenobi.  We are not prepared to see the great potential significance of Obi Wan giving into rage as he attacks Darth Maul.  Basically Obi Wan went to the dark side for a moment to defeat Darth Maul.  This stands in opposition to Luke's defeat of the Emperor in episode VI.  Obi Wan has evidenced a weakness that represents a crucial character flaw that impacts everything that happens afterwards.  Obi Wan's rage makes him a less than adequate mentor for a young Anakin who has a real problem with anger.  It is this crucifixion between love and the patience to choose other than a quick course decided by hatred for those who have destroyed what you love that must be chosen by the Jedi.  Otherwise, the dark side prevails.

This movie needed to explore the source of Obi Wan's rage and its consequences in order to give us a profound moment of ""Oh no!"" when he turned himself loose on Darth Maul.  I believe that it would not have taken much to create that effect given the rest of the plot.  Even if Obi Wan had a quick counseling session with Yoda afterwards and admitted his feelings in the moment in his fight with Darth Maul and a concerned response on Yoda's part regarding how his foresight has becomes significantly more clouded (as he mentions in episode II) might have been helpful.

Otherwise, I find the movie as engaging in every other sense as the previous movies.  I just think that this episode and episode II both lack this personal spiritual climax that we were spoiled with in the other three episodes.",1108512000,6,2272,4.57037037037037
658014,4,6303454038,"We all know the orginal trilogy is like god of movies etc...But you must look at this film differently from the orginal trilogy. If you were to compare a book to a film, obviously everyone is going to say the book is better because it is more detailed. Truly you can not compare a book to a film. A Film is not composed of the same material exactly to a book. Yes a film has chapters, and so does books but films are a layout, almost like an outline. Everyone compared Return of the King movie to a book. I love Rotk and the book but i do not compare them. I actually think the movie was much more well accumulated and put together than the Book! Star Wars Episode I is a totally new saga but the same criteria as the orginal trilogy. YOu must stop comparing the two. Stop complaining about the ships. You must realize that the whole triolgy is NOT COMPLETED!!!!!!!!!! SO WHY DO YOU JUDGE IT AND CALL IT ABSOLUTE GARBAGE????? EPISODE III, REVENGE OF THE SITH HASN'T EVEN BEEN SEEN! It will all make sense when the final chapter is completed. You must also relaize that Darth Maul is not a major villian! Darth Sidious is always the major villian. Lucas is trying to show you the Deception that Sidious unleashes upon the galaxy. Did you really think One Man and one apprentice could take over the galaxy? Sidious uses different people as his servants! Lucas said in the DVD, that he is the Puppet Master. That is what a Puppet Master does! He controls everyone and takes away free will. It's the power that evil grows from. You must also realize that even that Darth Sidious is the Enemy! It was not Vader! Sidious is truly the Personification of Absolute Evil.  Darth Maul is just a pawn used in Sidious's scheme. Another thing is that many say it does not remind them of anything from the Orginal Trilogy. How can it remind you, its a totally different World! Its Before The Dark Times! Before the Empire! Lucas has to show you how the Empire was all accumulated and brought together. It did not happen over NIGHT!!!!!! Jar Jar Binks is another issue. He is not really a big deal. He's just a crazy character in Star Wars. Yet i think he should had been protrayed different and a little more serious. He was designed for children just like Wicket. Yet no one said anything about Gollum or Wicket when they were made! I love Lotr but i think Gollum is an annoying S.O.B and i hate that character but he fits the PLot and Story! Jar Jar is just one of those characters that fits the Story! O and for Die Hard Fans Out there, which i could be considered one....Accept the fact that Anakin was born from a Virgin! Except it! it's in the Jedi Prophecy! That makes the Chosen One so significant. Well i am sorry for those who do not beleive in Incarnation. I don't care because i believe in incarnation, such as Jesus Christ's birth. Besides the point, I used to hate Episode I. Now i respect it more because i am realizing that they had to be done this way! People should not see Star Wars as a layout or blue print because of how the orginals were made. People should not point their fingers and say things like, ""O in Episode I, it should had been like A New Hope."" Its a totally different story! And i hate when people say it does not seem like the orginals because of the ships and etc. You must understand that this is a time of peace, glory and greatness before the Empire! This is when the Republic were in charge of Affairs! i actually think Episode I is better than Episode II! Wait and see for Episode III. i just know Lucas has something up his sleeves that will blow the fans away!!!!!!",1107820800,3,3595,4.333827893175074

658016,1,6303454038,"Waking up after a 24-hour drunk and looking in the mirror at your new ""face""?

Priceless.

Yep, that's exactly what happened to your Gentle Reviewer just days after I saw George Lucas's masterpiece ""Stars Wars Episode I: The Phantom Anus"". Dude, I tell ya, I was ready to rock and roll on this one, having just gotten into Seattle and never been to the Redlight/PornFlick district before.

That's when my buddy Ragnar said ""you dufus, this ain't gonna be porn---it's dat Star Wars prequel mammy-jammy everybody's talkin' bout"".

That was fine with me. I took a swig of the NightTrain, settled back in my seat, and let the power of Lucas's magnum opus take me for a magic carpetride.

The last Star Wars flick was ""Return of the Jedi"", and I saw that back in 1983. Sixteen years had intervened. Ten of 'em had been spent doing really hard time in the Laughing Horse Pentitentiary just outside Mad Dog, Texas, paying my debt to society. Anyhoo, to make a long story short, your buddy the Armored Eunuch was real excited to see what Old Man Lucas had taken sixteen long years to cook up. Here are my rough impressions:

1) JAR-JAR rawwwwwks! Everytime he was on screen he went to town and showed us some serious OWNAGE! It's a pity he doesn't get more screen time; Lucas should seriously go back and digitally introduce Jar-Jar Binks, everybody's favorite Gungan, into the three original flicks. They'd be tons better.

2) Cheap racist stereotypes? Nahhhhh. People need to mellow out about Lucas making all his aliens one-dimensional racial caricatures of the Italians, Japanese, and Jamaicans. Yeah, Jar-Jar looks a little like Bob Marley; yeah, Wotto (WOP-o? say it ain't so, George) needs only a sleeveless t-shirt to look like he just clambered outta the Tiber; yeah, the Trade Federation aliens can't do ""R""s right. And have blubbery lips, and epicanthic folds at the corners of their eyes....HEY!

3) When I go to a Star Wars flick, I really wanna spend most of the time with an annoying, smarmy, 6-year-old kid who looks and sounds like every other annoyingly smarmy 6-year-old kid. Naturally, I *don't* want lots of light saber fights, and I think it's a really good call to give the main villain, Darth Maul, about three minute of screen time. That way you get more JAR-JAR, man! And *everybody* loves Jar-Jar!

4) More of the two-headed sports announcer! Boy, whadda great character he was, and the CGI was just GREAT!

That's pretty much all I got to say about this fine cinematic classic ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Anus""; it's right up there with Uwe Boll's ""House of the Dead"" and ""Gigli"" in terms of movie greatness. I could watch it again and again.

In the meantime, can anybody e-mail me the name of a surgeon who can get this Darth Maul face tattoo off? Thanks.",1106697600,13,2783,4.705761316872428
658017,1,6303454038,"This movie makes me sick to my stomach! Its horrible acting (Jake Lloyd is awful), rotten ""cute"" characters (that's you, Jar Jar), and the incredibly uninteresting story (what does the liberation of Naboo have to do with anything that happens in the original trilogy?) make me want to upchuck.

First off is the acting. Who in the world saw any kind of potential in Jake Lloyd as the little Darth Vader?! He has got to be the worst actor in cinematic history. Some of the other actors also have a less than satisfactory and convincing way of getting their lines across on screen.

Secondly I would like to mention Jar Jar. (Where in the world did George come up with the name Jar Jar anyway? It sounds like an unintelligible word an infant would mumble to himself.) He looks like a cross between a frog and a chicken. The way he talks is as stupid as (if not stupider than) he is, and every moment his ugly face comes on the screen I can't help but cringe.

Lastly is the storyline. Wow, the Jedi go undercover to this beautiful planet called Naboo and free it from some weird, dopey droids. And during the fiasco they happen to have to land on Tatooine for repairs for their ship and meet Anakin Skywalker. What is the point of the entire Naboo story? Was it just put there because George Lucas couldn't think of anything better? I mean, come on. Couldn't they have done things a little better and more interestingly?

The casting was on the whole pretty good, with Ewen MacGregor and Liam Neeson stealing the day.

1) Jar Jar Binks. He is everything that was wrong with Return of the Jedi all over again (cutesy Ewoks, rolled up into one annoying alien).

2) Bad acting. Jake Lloyd was terrible, as were Pernilla August and Natalie Portman. I don't know why people like her. She's borderline Keanu Reeves/Uma Thurman bad. If you're looking for someone to just read lines, cast me - I'll work for cheap.

3) Bad story flow. This movie was long, but it felt long. Too long. It just didn't come across the way I was expecting it to come across - as the first chapter in a grand tale, where the viewer cares about the main characters, and is taken in by the grand scale of the beautiful and free pre-Empire world.

Having said all that, I still loved the movie, despite its many many many imperfections. I grew up with these movies, going to the Star Wars opening weekend in Walnut Creek, CA when I was six. I remember clearly standing in line with my dad and brother, amazed at the massive crowds. I even remember my dad complaining that he had never experienced such hooplah.

Yes, the movie answers questions and sets the stage for the films to follow, but it should have gone beyond that and did a better of job of selling us on the characters. There is no character development, period. Their relationships with each other are cold, and sterile. We all overlooked Luke's bad acting the first time round -- we liked him because we saw him grow and deal with things, and loved his interactions with Han and Vader and Obi -- and we cared. Not so much this time around.

But the film has some visually beautiful scenes, such as the battle of the Gungans versus the droids. Loved the lush green, obviously-computer-generated-but-still-way-cool scenes. And the whole underwater ride through the center of the planet. Fantastic.",1102982400,,1854,4.620060790273556

Everything that made Episodes IV through VI such classics - the beat-up ""hot rod"" spaceships, the cameraderie between the main characters, the epic struggle between an oppressive galactive empire and a small band of freedom fighters - all of that is just ... gone.  Gone.  There's just none of that in ""The Phantom Menace"".  The movie has no magic at all.  No great characters.  No memorable lines.  No compelling plot.  Just nothing.  Zip.  Nada.  Considering its pedigree, the movie is a total letdown.  ""The Phantom Menace"" becomes a rather ironic piece of self-commentary when Liam Neeson as a Jedi Knight observes that the trade dispute that is the movie's mcguffin is ""trivial"".  Imagine a film that stops to observe that its central plot point is a triviality.  George Lucas once said that a special effect without a story is pretty boring.  Well, that's what's wrong with ""The Phantom Menace"";  it's not a special effect without a story, but it comes dangerously close to being just that.  A movie about a nine-year-old kid?  George, what were you thinking?  Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker is a talented child, but he can't hold the weight of this movie on his small shoulders.  All in all ""The Phantom Menace"" is kind of like a science-fiction version of ""Much Ado about Nothing"":  people race around the galaxy, there's a lot of screaming and shooting and none of it really amounts to anything.

Most of the acting (...especially the kid), dialogue (...the Hutts, there ganstas) and CGI creatures suck (...Jar Jar Binks. They appear very cartoonish and annoying. There is no chemistry between the characters like Hamill, Ford & Fisher in Episode IV, V & VII.

The big battle scene sort of reminds you of ROTJ where a group of retarded creatures (cough..cough..ewoks) can destroy a powerful army with sticks and crap without one of them getting killed.

Every scene with the kid sucks, from the pod race to him destroying the droid army by pushing a couple of buttons.  His acting is about as good as the Olsen twins on Full House.

I also didn't think it was necessary to tie in R2-D2 & C3PO as neatly as the did.

The only cool part is the Darth Maul/Qui-Gon/Obi Wan lightsaber duel. The problem is you have to get through an hour and a half of crap to get to it.

This movie is easily on par with the Star Wars Holiday Special. The crappy Star Tours ride at Disney was better than this piece of garbage. I would say that even Willow was better.

The pod race sucks...

The announcers at the pod race really suck...

The kid's acting sucks...

658083,3,6303454038,"I hadnt seen this movie in the theater and bought the Wide Screen DVD instead. Much of the visual portions of the movie were very stunning but I wish that Lucas wouldnt put in such silly races in his movies. I guess he has to find something cuddly and likeable to make up for all of the dark forces in the flick.

In answer to one critic - the Ben Hur chariot race was from a different era and the race scene in this movie was a waste of footage as it would have been better to have spent more time developing relationships than how a character can win by flying a pod. The Ben-Hur race is by far more exciting and has MUCH more drama behind it. These days you can pump this kind of stuff out pretty much any time you like. Try finding someone like Steven Boyd and Charleton Heston to give you good acting!

Kids in Star Wars movies don't excite me. I would have preferred that less attention be shown on the kid and more on what was going on in the other side of the hill (bad guys) like they did in the original movies.

The acting by the ladies was well done. Some of the lines for Obi-Wan seemed out of place. Alec Guiness gives you the idea that he was less impulsive than his younger character portrays in this movie.

All in all I liked the movie and tried not to compare it to the other movies. I found myself interested in it as long as the flapper ears wasn't droning on and on to the other characters.

It was more of a comedy to me than a serious work but I guess that Lucas was trying to interject something to replace Skywalker, the Princess and of course the scoundrel Han Solo.

And Star Wars as a whole will never keep me coming back to watch it as well as Lord of the Rings does. It has everything to do with acting and very little to do with special effects.",1102032000,,1777,4.091954022988506

658085,4,6303454038,"I am giving Lucas and his film a half-star more credit than I feel this film deserves. My reasoning? Well, let's see...

First, unlike the original trilogy, the action and spectacle of this movie could not quite outweigh the bad acting. Don't get me wrong: I think Ewan MacGregor did an excellent job in this movie (as he does in just about everything he's in), while Natalie Portman and Liam Neeson (both absolutely wonderful actors in the proper roles) do the best they can with the script they were given. But then there is the wooden acting from our ""supervillain-to-be"" (I'm pretty sure the audience was supposed to feel Anakin's earnestness and feeling when he describes his love of podracing, not chuckle), and the ridiculously over-acted roles of the Gungans. I mean, I understand that Lucas was trying to appeal to kids (his own in particular, if I remember correctly), but the Ewoks in ""Jedi"" appealed to children and they never said a word of English. Hey, Jar-Jar, what the heck is a ""boom-de-gasser"" or a ""hedlibber""???

Second: On a more positive note, I have to give Lucas credit on this one for Darth Maul. Not only was the climax of ""The Phantom Menace"" one of the best fight scenes in the history of cinema, but Maul was one of the better villains to come out of celluloid in a long long while. My only complaint regarding Maul is that the audience is not given any of his history or backstory. It is my earnest opinion that more Maul and less Jar-Jar would have made this a much more Phantom-y and Menace-y experience.

Third: It seems to me that, having seen all the Episodes EXCEPT III, the arc of the ""Star Wars"" story mainly concerns Anakin and the price he pays for falling into evil. However, this first Episode more primarily deals with the rise of Palpatine to power, setting up the events of the coming movies. This is not a complaint, necessarily. I just think it would have been better if Lucas could have found a child-actor who had the capability of portraying subtle changes in attitude instead of just being exasperated with Yoda and frowning at Mace Windu. I realize he's supposed to still be an innocent, but even so ... Look at the amazing Dakota Fanning --- there are GOOD child-actors out there. Lucas should have found one. (Well, I guess that was kind of a repeat of my first point. Apologies.)

Fourth: The special-effects are excellent in this installment, as is the sound. Of course, with THX involved, just about anything will have a level of excellence in these fields. And THX IS ""Star Wars"".

I wish Lucas would have followed the example that he set for himself and NOT directed all three of the prequels. He directed ""A New Hope"", and did a wonderful job for an up-and-coming young director with limited means. But he handed the director's reins over to other people for ""Empire"" and ""Jedi"" both. And anyone who watches the original trilogy can see the improvements. I'm not criticizing Lucas as a creative mind. I am criticizing him as a film director. As I said, I think he does an admirable job with the skills and relatively limited experience he has had. But let's face it. He hadn't actually directed any film for YEARS when he began working on ""Phantom"". And it shows. For pure film spectacle, Lucas is wonderful. But to convey the complexities of the human heart, actors need better direction than ""Faster, with more intensity.""

But, hey ... I'll go see Episode III. Probably on opening night. Lucas has managed to create and sustain a phenomena that means a lot to a lot of people. And he deserves credit for that. Thanks, George!",1101254400,,3589,4.652996845425868

The duel, the great music, a young obi-wan, Portman's brilliant smiles etc. However the movie as a whole doesn't stack up to any of the LOTR films which deserved 5+ stars each and every 17 oscars the trilogy won.

This has to be one of the worst films ever made. Think about it. If this were a first-time film by an unknown, it would be derided for the pap that it is. It would NOT EVEN merit a sequel. It would be a flop. Fans have been HAD with this AWFUL film. Let me say this though: I wept tears when I saw the 2 minute teaser trailer for the first time. Judging from the look and feel of that trailer - which IS included on this dvd - one would say the wait was worth it. It was a glorious preview. UNFORTUNATELY, that trailer is the ONLY thing worth viewing with the re-visiting to Star Wars Land. The acting is horrible. You can only hope that two fine actors, MacGregor and Neeson, will live this down. I believe they can. Everything else in this film feels so hollow, so WRONG. What would have made this an interesting dvd would have been the option to mute out all the dialogue and just have music and sound cues (remember when dvds used to have isolated audio tracks like that?). The visuals of the pod race are impressive, but the stretching of disbelief, even in a sci-fi fantasy, of a tyke flying like an ace, IS asking too much.

658141,5,6303454038,"First of all, I am fully capable of admiting that this movie has flaws. Every movie has flaws. In fact, this movie had a good number of very impressive flaws that I will now list.

Flaw 1: The acting was (in general) not particularly impressive. It comes down to two catagories of sub-par actors: Jake Loyd, and the supporting cast. Sorry Jake. The ""Are you an angel"" scene will make even the most dogmatic Star Wars fan cringe. And all of the supporting cast seemed rather bored.

Flaw 2: Jar-Jar Binks. He isn't quite the horror that many people describe him as, but having said that, he is rather annoying.

Flaw 3: The battle droids. They simply aren't any substitute for the Stormtroopers. They look silly (although in the commentary Lucas says that they're supposed to look that way) and they just don't work very well.

Having recited the flaws that I see in this film, let me explain the five-star rating.

When I first watched this movie, I was somewhat dissapointed. However, after watching Episode 2, and having watched this film more, it began to grow on me. And now I can say with confidence that I enjoy this film (Despite its flaws) as much as I enjoy the original trilogy. That's not to say that it is better that the originals, but it has that Star Wars feel, that sense of adventure that we all enjoyed as kids in the original trilogy. And that is why it is worthy of the name: Star Wars.

Many a reviewer previous has stated how they didn't connect with the characters. I disagree. I only think that Jake Loyd, and the supporting cast's acting was sub-par. Ewan McGregor did a fine job as Obi-Wan Kenobi, and although he is no Alec Guiness, he certainly delivers and makes for a splendid Obi-Wan. Ian McDiarmid does a magnificent job as senator Palpatine. He is able to act as a character that is acting, and he does it magnificently. I also like the potrayal of Yoda. In the original trilogy Yoda was introduced as a lunatic old alien. Now he is introduced in the proper way; as a stern old master of the force. I also think that the character of Watto is one of the greatest CGI characters of all time, ranking up there with Gollum from the Lord Of The Rings.

But I think that the greatest contribution (acting-wise) to the Star Wars universe in episode 1 was that of Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn. Leeson is a magnificent actor, and almost (I dare to say) as good as Alec Guiness in how he potrays a jedi master. Qui-Gon is one of my all time favorite Star Wars characters, and I don't see how anyone could say that the characters of episode 1 don't connect when there's Qui-Gon staring them in the face.

Of course the special effects are brilliant and ahead of their time. The sound is absolutey amazing, and in fact is far superior to the original trilogy. And the soundtrack by John Williams is perhaps the greatest of all the Star Wars soundtracks, because it takes us back to 1977, when we were just discovering Star Wars for the first time. The soundtrack will bring back that sense of wonder that we experienced a long time ago, in a theater far far away.

The action sequences are of course incredible. The duel of the fates between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan, and Qui-Gon is by far the best Star Wars action sequence thus far (Episode 3 anyone?). And then of course there is the podrace. The podrace is one of my all time favorite scenes in all of the Star Wars saga, because it is one of the greatest actions scenes, but also because it is packed with fun details (most of them can only be found on the DVD however). On the DVD you will see a vendor selling alien frogs to patrons as the pods flash by. You will hear one of the pilots of the pods screaming with exhilaration as he zooms past. These and many other details make this scene brilliant.

But the true reason that I am giving this movie five stars (which is an obviously contriversial thing to do) is because it conveys the sense of wonder that I had as a kid so long ago when I first watched Star Wars for the first time. People may scorn episode 1 for being too childish, but I think that these people are being too elitist. Chances are that they were kids when they first watched Star Wars, and were swept away by it. On repeat viewings, I too was swept away by this movie, and people that say ""Too childlike"" need to slow down. Star Wars is a very bright, energetic saga that appeals to the young and the young at heart. I don't always want to watch a gritty movie with oodles of gore. That's why I love the Phantom Menace. It's a great movie, and if you really liked Star Wars, I would encourage you to give it a chance.

May the force be with you... Always.",1098057600,4,4649,4.375434530706837
658142,5,6303454038,"When I read all the negative reviews of this movie, it really surprised me. I went into it expecting a lot, having grown up with the originals, and it easily surpassed all of my expectations. I like it more every time I watch it. Honestly, I have to say I like it better than its counterpart in the original trilogy, A New Hope. There's just so much more to the plot in this movie, and in Attack of the Clones, too. Instead of the old good vs. evil, black and white storyline, we're presented here with a morally ambiguous, politically driven plot which is highly complex. I had to watch the movie several times before I felt I completely understood everything that was going on. Call me strange, but this kind of set-up appeals to me more than something more black-and-white. Seeing how Palpatine manipulates everyone to elevate himself into power is just great to see, especially when the Jedi and the Naboo all think they've won in the end, when really they haven't accomplished anything. Deliciously ironic.

I've heard some other people call it ""heartless"", but I don't see that either. For all its over-reliance on CGI and visual 'wow-factor', it is, for me, one of the most human of all the Star Wars movies. All the scenes between Anakin and Qui-Gon, and Anaking and his mother, are really touching, and really sad, given what we know about his character.

As for the people who think the movie is too childish, well, all the Star Wars movies are like this. Even Empire has a lot of pretty silly comic relief. Lucas really hasn't changed much in that vein. Sure, Jar Jar is a pretty superfluous character, but he's there to appeal to the kids, just like the droids did in the originals (since C-3P0 has a really tiny role in this one). I have to say, though, that I don't find Jar Jar annoying at all, and I still don't see how anyone else does, either. (Guess it's all a matter of taste.) And c'mon, how cool is Darth Maul? That lightsaber duel was just incredible to watch.

So in the end, interesting characters, deep plot, great soundtrack and visual effects.. just a very good setup for the saga overall.",1097971200,3,2117,4.551181102362205

658147,3,6303454038,"Getting straight to the point, This film is beautifully CGI rendered and has moved the goal posts of how modern day films are made.

It has some exciting moments and the best sword fight in movie history so far but ultimately lacks substence. It is poorly acted, the computer effects are too much at times and has a storyline that will baffle most people. One of the main characters in the film, Jar Jar Binks, is one of the most ruinous aspects overall because of his Disney-like stupid, incoherent nature. I genuinely cringe whenever he opens his mouth. Another huge dissapointment was the lack of screen time or dialogue for the new bad guy Darth Maul with only three lines in the film and they're short. The Podracer sequence is over-hyped but is still an impressive moment none the less. The lightsaber fight at the end is worth buying this fim for. It is very dramatic with stupendous choreography and brilliant use of camera angles to capture the peril of the scenes.

Overall the film has it's ups and downs but you must see it at least once. Preferably twice to try and get the plot sorted out in you mind. It makes much more sense that way. Possibly Rent First",1097539200,,1170,4.540284360189573
658148,5,6303454038,"Before I start on this review, let me tell you that I am a relatively new fan of star wars, so my opinions may be slightly different than those loyal fans who have been with these movies from the very begining.

I saw this film a few days after watching the original trilogy, and although I still prefer the original, I think this is amazing too. It is incredible to see Annakin Skywalker as that little innocent boy, and unnerving to remember what he becomes. It goes to show how even the most evil villains began life as a normal person. They weren't born evil.

The plot is interesting, and I think the acting is pretty good. But my favourite thing about the movie is seeing the younger versions of everyone, what they were like before they became the well known charactors we know today. Obi Wan seemed so different from that confident and expereinced old man that you meet in episode 4, but Annakin still amazes me the most. Throughout all the movie I just kept remembering his face in episode 6, when Luke removed his mask, and wondering how could anyone so sweet become something so pitiless and cruel? It was kind of sad.

Overall, I give this film a 5, because even though it wasn't as good as the originals, it was still a very good film.",1097452800,2,1248,4.417391304347826

658182,3,6303454038,"""The Phantom Menace"" isn't what everyone expected it to be.  Die-hard Star Wars fans were expecting another ""A New Hope.""  Casual fans were hoping to get more of the whiz-bang adventure that was presented to them in the initial trilogy.  Folks relatively new to the Star Wars phenomenon were left wondering what the big deal was over all of these films to begin with.

What we were actually given was a typical, contemporary, over-budget sci-fi flick that had great intentions and huge shoes to fill.  Perhaps George Lucas let his delusions of grandeur go to his head.  Perhaps all of the Star Wars geeks placed him on such a tall pedestal that all he could do was fall.  Maybe he just ran out of ideas.  No matter what, I think it is safe to say that this film was doomed from the get-go.  Even if it were the greatest film ever made, it will always be in the shadow of the original trilogy.  The second film, ""Attack Of The Clones,"" probably benefited from this fact since it is not the first film in the new trilogy and the standard set by ""Menace"" isn't that high.

There are few memorable performances from this film.  Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson do well as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn, but I couldn't connect with either of them in this film like I did with Alec Guinness in ""A New Hope.""  The kid who played Anakin Skywalker was a little bit annoying to me.  I'm glad to see him out of the picture.  Jar-Jar Binks was raped by critics and fanboys alike, but I have to admit that his oafish comedy actually helped me trudge along through this film.  As a matter of fact, the character that I disliked the most was the one that no one would stop talking about:  Darth Maul.  For some reason, I got the feeling that this guy was forced on us in the hopes that he would achieve Boba Fett-like legendary status.  Boba Fett had few lines, but people fell in love with him.  Maul has a few more lines, and I hated him.  Both of them were supposed to be sinister warriors and feared opponents.  Both of them had cool costumes.  They each had a neat sounding voice.  But in the end, Boba Fett's popularity came unexpectedly.  Maul's fame came by way of commercialism.

The special effects were excellent, though they worked against the original trilogy in that the technology looked billions of light years ahead of the original films.  How can you fly around in clunkers after you've had such fancy ships as Amidala's cruiser?  The lightsaber battles were enjoyable, but without Vader or Luke in them, I felt somewhat cheated.  The android troops seemed to be more efficient in this flick than the slow-minded stormtroopers in the original series, but the stormtroopers had something to them that cold androids with guns lack.  Stormtroopers screwed up and they looked funny doing it.  These androids try to drop one-liners, but they aren't funny at all.  In fact, they gave the Jedi bigger problems than the stormtroopers.

In all, things just don't add up between the original trilogy and this new one.  Sure, these new films are adequate, but they will never be as good as the original ones for the simple fact that they are sequels to the originals.  The standard set by the original series is almost unreachable, but I'd love to see Lucas come as close to that standard as possible with the ""new"" third film.

I recommend this to folks who merely need a base for the original trilogy or fans who are willing to look beyond the shortcomings of the new flicks.  Average movie-goers may not see what's so special about the Star Wars mythos, but if they view the original films, I'm sure they'll understand.",1096848000,,3613,4.56298600311042
658183,3,6303454038,"When I first saw Star Wars Episode I- The Phantom Menace at the 12:01 AM showing on opening day, all the familiar elements were intact. The 20th Century Fox logo,the tag line ""A Long Time Ago..."", then the title Star Wars with John Williams classic score playing behind it, then the familiar scroll this time detailing the beginning of the movie. Then we begin to see that this is an entirely new Star Wars.
 Coming sixteen years after Return of the Jedi,TPM looks and feels different from the first trilogy. The special effects are amazing as a majority of the movie is filmed against CGI.Unfortunately the CGI curses the movie as the storytelling factor is diluted.
 This is George Lucas's first directing job since the first SW movie 22 years ago. Being a bit rusty, as well gearing the movie towards kids(which plagued ROTJ)left a bad taste in most fans mouth. Most barbs are pointed at the character of Jar Jar Binks(Ahmad Best), an annoying yet endearing Gungan who's main funtion was comic relief,but comes off as obnoxious. The other is the weak script that talks down to fans, and dialogue which talented actors (Liam Neeson,Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman,Samual L. Jackson) has to struggle with. Jake Lloyd, who plays Anakin Skywalker suffers the most in a role that may ruin any chance of a further acting career.
 The saving grace of the movie is the villianous Darth Maul who wields a double edge lightsaber in a fabulous lightsaber fight that blows away the previous films climactic battles, as well as the podrace on Tatooine. Unfortunatly the validity of a young Anakin saving the day stretches credibility very thin.
 As far as older fans are concerned,this is an entirly different SW from the previously trilogy. Despite the state of the art effects and exciting scenes, TPM stands as the weakest SW movie as Lucas loses sight of what made the previous trilogy so loved by the fans. Beloved characters and strong storytelling.",1096243200,,1944,4.86404833836858
658184,1,6303454038,"George Lucas tried just a little to hard to equal the succes of his first trilogy. The acting is atrocious, the computer effects stand out, and jar jar binks is annoying! Is this really the same man who made the brilliant mythological film of 1977 - which was good not because of its special effects but because of its humanity?",1094947200,11,328,4.483333333333333
658185,3,6303454038,"I'm in the crowd that's quickly becoming the bane of the Star Wars fan community. One of those pesky people that saw the film at age 7 when it first erupted onto the big screen. Leading the charge in support of getting new films out (which I consider our sacred duty, after all we waited over 20 years for it) we were also the first to shy away from them when they didn't match up to our expectations.

Enter The Phantom Menace (TPM), a Star Wars episode that feels quite a bit out of step with the original three. Visually this is a stunning movie, and I think that this facet is what it will be remembered for. The lightsaber duel between Gui-gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul makes the one in Star Wars: A New Hope look like a geriatric aerobic workout in comparison. The podraces were absolutely awesome. The set design and costumes were also very well put together.

*scratches his chin contemplatively*

And now for the constructive criticism portion of my review. After all if fight correography and CGI graphics were all that were necessary to make a movie beloved then I have no doubt the ""Final Fantasy"" movie and ""Mortal Kombat"" would be ranked up there with ""Citizen Kane"". Sorry Mr. Lucas :(

1. If there's any one nit I have to pick with this movie and ""Attack of the Clones"" it would have to be the lack of chemistry between characters. Luke, Leia, and Han didn't have to be top-notch actors in their respective roles in the original 3 movies, but any doubts we had about their acting talent was put aside by the great chemistry that they had on screen. It really worked, and while I like each of the individual actors in TPM I simply don't connect with any of them. And for the record I get the impression they don't really connect with each other either. That magic is missing, and it plagues this movie and AOTC as well. I guarantee you that if this element was present in TPM it would receive a much better rating.

2. Whoever wrote the individual lines for the actors needs to be blasted. And don't set them for stun. Through most of the movie we're bombarded by wooden acting by people that you almost get the impression had to be poked to be reminded that it was their turn in the script (that chemistry thing again). Jake Lloyd's lines were absolutely unbelievably bad, although the movie being more directed towards kids I can let it slide.

3. Every movie needs a sidekick. Chewbacca was Han Solo's steadfast companion. His lines consisted of grunts and growls, but the movies were designed so that you always knew what he was saying because Solo conversed with him in that special way. Now we have Jar-Jar Binks, part Murphy's Law victim, part reggae aquatic-Bob Marley guy, but 100% annoying. I remember grimacing in my chair in the theater as he recited his routine. I feel really bad for the guy who voiced him, probably the most disliked person in the western hemisphere. Therein again since this was designed to be mostly a kids movie I can even let Jar-Jar slide a little bit. But not much. Hand me that blaster, would you?

4. The plot is a bit deep for Star Wars fare. I'm not saying that the first 3 were too simple, I'm saying that the concept was very straightforward. Good vs. Evil, dad versus son, lots of nuance and a whole pile of special effects. This movie takes the shoestring premise of the first three films and turns it into the Gordian Knot. We have the Trade Federation blockading Naboo for some reason. Then there's the future Emperor who orders them to invade. Why? And what's with all the Senate intrigue? Why explain midiclorians (sp?) as the prime mover of the Force? Why is Yoda so unlikeable in this one? And most of all why make a movie so obviously aimed at a younger audience have so many plot points and loose ends?

In the end the first 3 movies will always be revered. I'm not so sure about this one. It's liable to end up being like a not-so-good episode of your favorite TV show. You watch it because even though it's not good you need to see it to get to the next episode.",1094860800,4,4044,4.455405405405405

To me he didn't seem very deep.  He just seemed like a dumb kid along for the ride.  Kind of like whiny little Luke in episode four.  I had the feel of the original trilogy that it was like an actual event.  I was watching the history of some other universe.  It's kinda hard to explain.  That was its appeal with me.  I don't get that same kind of connection with this movie.",1094515200,,532,4.23

I realize that since this is a ""star wars"" I probably rate it more harshly then other movies but still, this movie was in the works for years and it would of been better left on the drawing board. I will never go to see episode 2 or 3 as this is a clear indication of the direction of these prequels.

658239,3,6303454038,"When I think of the difference between the original 3 Star Wars movies and this one, the word that comes to mind is ""swashbuckling"".

There was a kind of Errol-Flynn-wink-to-the-camera while swordfighting bravura to the first three films. They didn't take themselves too seriously. This covered up two shortcomings:

1. The plot, for all of its Joseph Campbell overtones, is basically a comic book.

2. George Lucas is an emotionally distant director who has difficulty soliciting great emotional performances from actors.

Lucas can't seem to decide where he wants to go in this film. Jar-Jar is a bust at comic relief. I think of Princess Leia (saying of Chewbacca) ""Will someone get this walking carpet out of my way?."" Jar-Jar deserves much worse, but it seems like there is a code of trans-species politcal correctness that is now observed. Poor Jake Lloyd (Anakin Skywalker) and his Pernilla August (his mother, Shmi Skywalker) have some of the most stilted and poorly directed dialog I have heard in a major movie. Lucas isn't emotionally tone-deaf, but his range is very limited.

Lucas is still at master at getting great bang for the buck, the film is sumptuous and stunning. The pod race scene is great fun. You can get lost in the eye candy details he provides. I thought some of the costumes were a little over the top, but on the whole great fun.

I just wish Mr. Lucas wouldn't take the rest of this so seriously. It's a Saturday Matinee, George, the force will take care of itself without getting too preachy about it. Have fun!",1094256000,4,1544,4.785714285714286

This film has a good story and the action is good. The acting is a little kid-ish: farting Eopies, Jar Jar stepping in 'poodoo' Anakin yelling 'yippee', etc. However, Darth Maul (and his lightsaber) made the movie, as did Liam Nesson's acting. The best special feature that I liked was the Beginning: Making of Epsiode I. All & all, a great film. I can see why hard-core star wars fans wouldn't like it as much (or at all) compared to the others, but it's neat to see Obi-Wan as a Jedi learner; the Republic and the Jedi Order still alive.

658241,5,6303454038,"In my opinion, the Star Wars prequels are strictly for fans. Anybody can understand the original Trilogy, but the story isn't very clear in the prequels, and anybody who watches Episode 1 just because it's another movie to watch won't be satisfied. I think it's going to take Episode 3 to clear up everything for those of us who haven't figured the story out, but that should be expected. Each movie is part of a story, and not meant to be a story to be enjoyed on its own. Think about it. When you read a book, are the first few chapters very exciting or enjoyable. Most of the time they aren't, and that's because they are there for the sole purpose of helping you understand the rest of the story. I guess most people don't think of it this way and look at the movies as junk. Everyone I know who isn't a big fan says the prequels were bad and I expect that, although I don't like it. Fortunately, with the release of Episode 3 we can go back to Episodes 1 and 2, and understand everything. For those of you who are not big Star Wars fans, let me tell you this. The plot is real simple; it's just not obvious. Oh, and if you think this is still about the Empire and the Rebellion, it's not. Everything in Episodes 1-6 is about Palpatine and his attempt to rule the galaxy with Anakin at his side, which leads to Anakin bring balance to the Force. That's all there is. Keep in mind that Palpatine may be Darth Sidious, who has the same ambition. Also, anything bad that happens against the Republic, is because of Darth Sidious. That's all. Hopefully all you non-fans understand things more clearly now. Sorry that this strayed away from the Episode 1 DVD.

  We were all younger then and the films were like the first of their kind and the special effects were so brand new (before CGI effects). We had always hoped for a sequel of movies with the original actors: Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher with R2-D2 and C-3PO.
  Instead, George Lucas decided 22 years later to make prequels (the story before the original story we saw in 1977).  So as a result of this, in 1997, the original films were re-issued with the name change of STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE (1977/97) .  THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK now is Episode V (5) and RETURN OF THE JEDI, now is Episode VI (6).  New special effects and footage were included.
  The brand new film STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE (1999) (Followed by STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES [2002] and STAR WARS III: REVENGE OF THE SITH [2005]) was a disappointment to me, the excitement just was not there. Special effects are entertaining, but didn't care for the storytelling. I don't like Samuel L. Jackson and I can not stand Jar Jar Binks.
  Seeing the story of Yoda before STAR WARS (1977) is interesting to me.  So what is this film about? The beginning of Darth Vader, now a child, who was the villain in Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Return Of The Jedi (1983).
  Jake Lloyd is memorable in his role as ""Anakin"".

They bought some amazing new characters into the series with this film,such as Qui-Gon(Obi-Wan's teacher),Jar Jar(a clumsly Gungan who is not annoying despite what people say),and Darth Maul(a evil Sith apprentice who is really cool).Some amazing scenes(the podrace,Obi's and Oui-Gon's fight,etc.)and some things that connect this film and the orignals together are just some of the things to enjoy in this chapter in the Star Wars saga. All in all,a very good film that I truly recommend!!!",1092096000,,537,5.183908045977011
658246,1,6303454038,"I tried to like it, I really did.  It's Star Wars for Cripes sake!  At first I was stunned, then sad, then just angry!  In defense of Lucas, I think he had a stroke or something and now he's retarded.  There really isn't any other explaination.  It was like a porn film, only without the sex, script or acting!  I felt dumber for watching it and it pisses me off that I'll never get those 2 hours of my life back.

I thought it was a fluke so when the Attack of the Clones came out, I, like a complete dumbass, went to see it.  Needless to say, now there are 4 hours of my life gone with nothing to show for it.  I could have spent that time slamming my testicals in a door jam or trying to score at the nursing home.

Should I even bother seeing the Revenge of the Sith?  I think I'll wait till it comes to TV, not cable, UPN or the WB!  Why should I fork out 10 bucks for that crap, when I could spend that money on some crack.",1091750400,12,929,3.882978723404255

658327,1,6303454038,"I love Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. I think that George Lucas should have stopped there. The two movies: The Phantom Menace and the Attack of the Clones....SUCK! What was George Lucas thinking? Jar Jar Binks needs to tossed off the face of the earth, and Hayden Christansen (while hot), needs to take some acting lessons. Not enough special effects in the world could make me want to see the third release. Poor acting and writing have made me want to run for cover! Where's the FORCE when you need it?",1088553600,23,529,4.520833333333333
658328,3,6303454038,"I was one of the only people in the world who did not see ""The Phantom Menace"" in theaters, and instead waited until it came out on video and all the hype had died down.  Perhaps this was why I did not see it as a monumental disappointment, since I didn't watch it believing it was going to be the best movie of the year.  This is one of the most bashed films of modern times, and I don't think it deserves all of its negative publicity.  Ironically, for how bad everyone says it is, Lucas still got what he wanted out of the movie- it's still the highest grossing post-""Titanic"" film (though ""Shrek 2"" is closing fast, and ""Spider-Man 2"" may reach it also), and was the third-highest grossing film of the 1990's when adjusted for inflation.
I see ""The Phantom Menace"" as simply an entertaining adventure.  It has a criminally slow first half, but some of the scenes in its second half are truly spectacular, such as the pod race and the Darth Maul fight.  Everyone says how bad the acting is, but I found most of the actors passable- only Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker irritated me.  The special effects are incredible for the most part, and the final space battle leaves you breathless.
Of course, ""The Phantom Menace"" is not a great movie by any means.  Darth Maul was criminally underdeveloped, and the Trade Federation bad guys were dull and lifeless.  Whenever Jake Lloyd appeared on the screen, I wondered if I was watching a dumb kids movie.  Overall, ""The Phantom Menace"" simply cannot compare with ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  Then, of course, there's the immortal Jar Jar Binks.  If Episode III has a chance of being as successful as the original ""Star Wars"" films, it will feature Jar Jar's slow and painful death, perhaps replayed over and over again in a flashback.
In the end, ""The Phantom Menace"" is just a couple hours of good entertainment, neither as bad nor as good as many claim it is.  I actually slightly prefer ""The Phantom Menace"" to ""Attack of the Clones"", which was boring and too serious for its own good.  However, there may be some nostalglia factor there- I miss the days of 1999, when everything was going great and the world had nothing better to do than freak out over the new ""Star Wars"" movie.",1088467200,3,2229,4.5425
658329,3,6303454038,"Jedi master Qui-Gonn Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), encounter young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) while aiding Queen Amidala's (Nathalie Portman) attempt to break a crippling trade blockade on her planet.  They take the future Darth Vader under their wing, setting the stage for future tragedy.  Clearly, the universe is about to be plunged into war.
The state-of-the-art special effects provide plenty to look at, but otherwise there is little to recommend this film.  The roles are underdeveloped with the result that the cast, which is packed with fine actors, come across as dull because they have nothing to do.  I realize that this film is not primarily about characterization, but just think back to the main characters of the original trilogy--Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia--and how much fun it was to watch them interact.  Was that because Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher are better actors than anyone in ""Phantom Menace?"" No, it's because those characters had some fire in them.  The characters in this movie just seem to be rushing from scene to scene.
When you've got the resources that writer-director George Lucas has to produce a bang-up action flick, you can pretty much guarantee a certain level of satisfaction if you just let the story build its momentum and stay out of its way.  A film with great special effects that just allows itself to be spectacular without derailing itself can pretty much count on getting at least 4 stars from me.  However, just as he did with the Ewoks in ""Return of the Jedi,"" Lucas has introduced a character and a race so annoying that I groaned inwardly every time they appeared on screen.  I haven't seen ""Attack of the Clones"" yet, but the prospect of having Jar Jar Binks and the Gunguns inflicted on me again doesn't make me feel any sense of urgency to do so.",1087948800,2,1883,4.877742946708464
658330,5,6303454038,"This was a nice way to begin the Star Wars Saga. Immediatly, we are introduced to Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn and of course our main hero, Obi-Wan Kenobi. The film takes off from the Federation Control ship to the awesome Pod Race and then on to the final battle on the planet Naboo. This film is action packed and worthy of being called a Star Wars movie. The characters are well set up for Attack of the Clones and gives us a whole new look on Star Wars. Best Scene: The Three Way duel between Darth Maul, Jinn, and Kenobi is a Star Wars fans dream!

I was mightily dissapointed with this movie, and I could go on and on about contrived plots and love stories, purile dialogue,  and gungans who could insult the intelligence of a horsefly... but I wont.
The DVD in itself was very well made, worthy of the LucasArts logo.
But (and maybe I was expecting too much), I found the movie uninteresting, the stakes not high enough, and I didn't care if any character lived or died.",1086825600,,530,4.520833333333333
658332,1,6303454038,"Come on people. I was a kid when the the REAL star wars movies came out. Now I show them to my son and they rock...we have a blast and the darn things are almost 30 years old. This recent garbage from Lucas shows he SHOULD NOT be directing adult films!!!! They are flat and lack ANY of the emotional buy-in needed for a legend film series. The orginal series was so good that it became part ""religion"" to many people. They were so good, you had a frenzy when these new movies were coming out. The orginal movies were made for adults with a story so compelling, you didn't need 100 million in special effects to pull it off. Lucas should have done what he did with the first series...let other people direct them! What a disgrace to the orginal Star Wars trilogy. I think that's the point...the original Star Wars was an adult film that was good for some kids too. The new Star Wars is simply a kids series that seems laughable when it tries to get serious for a few minutes.",1086566400,4,974,4.27027027027027

IMO, better than Episode II in quality and movie.  Characters are also great with Darth Maul, Anikin, young Obi-Wan, and Padme.  I think that this movie would have been better if Jar Jar didn't have such a big of role as he had in this film, but I think that this movie had a better story and WAYYYY batter acting then found in Episode II.  Nice way to kick off the prequals.",1084233600,2,538,4.115384615384615
658336,5,6303454038,"The most eagerly-awaited prequel in movie history, ""Episode I:  The Phantom Menace"" carried so many false hopes into theatres many were bound to be disappointed.  But the problem isn't with the movie itself, which is first-rate.  There were just too many people who had their own ideas of what the first new Star Wars film in nearly a generation should be like for creator George Lucas to possibly satisfy.  Sadly, those persons' negative reviews have somewhat marred an otherwise phenomenal blockbuster, which by any well-reasoned definition is a highly worthy extension of the beloved Star Wars mythos.
Even the film's critics agree that this movie looks spectacular.  Lucas spared no expense in the set design and special effects, and the result is simply magical.  From the iconic architecture of the planet Naboo to the wastes of Tatooine and the cold reaches of space, everything shimmers with life and you almost feel like you could walk right into the story yourself. Beyond that, the story itself is excellent and in line with the familiar Star Wars formula of good vs. evil on an interplanetary scale.  Likewise, the cast is terrific and does a tremendous job.  Liam Neeson is an commanding Qui-Gon Jinn who dominates every scene he is in, and Ewan McGregor is also excellent as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi just growing into his full power but clearly destined to be one of the greatest Jedi of all.  Natalie Portman's Padme is appealing and believable, and Jake Lloyd is surprisingly effective as the ill-fated Anakin Skywalker.  Ian McDiarmid lends a sinister air as the shadowy Senator Palpatine, whose suave elegance barely conceals his true dark nature.
Yes, there is Jar Jar Binks, and while Jar Jar does occasionally strike a funny note he is more often annoying.  And young Mr. Lloyd does have to utter some rather painful lines from time to time.  But these minor flaws hardly hinder the overall drama, which is quite strong.  Particularly moving is Anakin's final dialogue with his mother, when he stands at the crossroads of his destiny and realizes that once he chooses which path to take, he can never look back. Of course there is also the famous pod race, a deadly race against fate that shoots across the Tatooine desert like lightning. The masterful extended climax (divided amongst no less than four different battles)is incredibly exciting.  Here young Anakin foreshadows Luke Skywalker's later Death Star heroics, and Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan face the diabolical Darth Maul in an incredible display of lightsaber wizardry.
No review of this film would be complete without mention of John Williams's usual fantastic score.  The soundtrack is magnificent, one of the most thrilling any movie has ever had, and it should've been used a bit more liberally in ""Attack of the Clones.""
Not only is the movie great, but the DVD is something special too.  There are tons of special features that are sure to enhance what should be an already awesome viewing experience.
Overall, most of the negative press this movie got was undeserved.  The characters are strong, the action unceasing, and the final product is nothing less than sensational.  If it's not quite as good as the original Star Wars films, ""The Phantom Menace"" nonetheless recaptures the spirit of those immortal movies and opens a brand new door to wonder and fantasy.  Don't be afraid...come on in!",1083801600,10,3376,4.9857397504456324

658378,5,6303454038,"Now I'm not a nerd, I'm a geek, there's a big difference!!
I really enjoy this Star Wars movie. Great special effects, a touch of humour, even Jar Jar is witty if you give him half a chance.
Darth Maul was my favourite charecter in this one. I'ts a pity he bit the dust but there are some awesome lightsabre battles to enjoy between him and Qui Gon (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan (Ewan Mcgregor). Speaking of Obi-Wan, Mcgregor did a really great job of playing a younger version, he had Alec Guinness down pat.
The pod race was also awesome, reminded me of the chariot race in Ben-Hur. Natalie Portman was a little reserved but considering she was playing the queen of Naboo I don't know what else people expected. Loved the younger Yoda in this and was interesting to see Palpatine as a politican in pre-Emperor days behind the scenes operating like a puppet-master.
Being a Star Wars fanatic, I awaited this movie like none other since the original trilogy and the day it came out I went twice and was not disappointed, the people who hate this film really need to find peace in their lives and quit being so petty and bitter. And don't hate me for liking this film, I'm really a nice guy!

658379,2,6303454038,"Why was this movie even made?  It contributed little plot development to the Star Wars universe.  Lucas could have taken all the important stuff in Phantom and added an extra half hour to Attack of the Clones instead.  That way we would have been spared the lacking plot, the throw-away characters, and the bad acting.
The plot was really lacking.  It is a nice, Sunday-afternoon kind of movie, but that isn't what a Star Wars movie is supposed to be.  This movie was great for the kiddies, especially with Jake Lloyd's whining, Jar Jar's antics and the droids, but it left the adult audience disappointed and unsatisfied.  There was a lot of action, but no real suspense or complexity.  Even the attempts at misdirection were thinly veiled.
Three characters stood out an throw-aways:  Qui-Gon, Darth Maul, and Aurra Sing.  Out of the three, Qui-Gon got the most mileage as the driving force behind a majority of the movie's plot.  I understand why Qui-Gon was used the way he was, but that doesn't mean it was the only or the best way to further that aspect of the story.  Darth Maul, who was a nice mysterious villain, was painfully underused and dispatched rather easily.  This limited the impact he could have had on the story.  As for Aurra Sing, there was a lot of press about her prior to the release, but I can't remember if she made the final cut of the movie.
The acting, or lack there of, spoke for itself.  While Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid and Liam Neeson were great; they were over shadowed by the poor acting of Jake Lloyd and the incessant banter of Jar Jar.
The best part of the movie was the way it looked.  ILM did a masterful job with the special effects.  The ships were cool and the scenery was beautiful.  Even though ""the look"" is very important to the Star Wars universe, it's bad when then special effects stand out more than the plot.",1082505600,2,1862,4.543543543543543

  In the original Star Wars, there is suspence and drama because we are given a chance to know and care about the characters.  Special effects are tools of the trade, used to aid in the telling of the story.  It seems that the new trend is to come up with some really ""cool"" special effects, then string them together with bad dialogue and call it a movie.  Maybe we (the movie-going public) should petition George Lucas (and the Wachowski brothers too, while we're at it) to just stop.  Star Wars: Episodes I and II both SUCK.  I don't intend to even watch Episode III.",1082419200,3,743,4.294964028776978
658382,5,6303454038,"Film (3/5)
The first episode of the Star Wars saga suffers from poor dialogue and some childish elements that have somehow found their way into the film.  The storyline itself strikes me as mediocre compared to the original three films, however, the main points got across as they needed to so that the beginnings of this movie series could be explained.
Video (5/5)
Sound (5/5)
Special Features (5/5)
There is a commentary by members of the crew, including George Lucas which is interesting enough if you have the time to listen to it.  There are several deleted scenes that include small features on how they were developed and why they were cut.  ""The Beginning: Making Episode I"" is a very interesting and insightful look into the entire production of the film.  Five smaller features highlight various aspects of the movie, and the twelve part documentary series featured on starwars.com is definitely worth a look as well.  Also included is the music video for ""Duel of the Fates"" and a feature on the making of the Starfighter video game.  There are features on the development of the podrace and submarine scenes, a still photo gallery, posters, trailers, and tv spots.

it was the same traditional old StarWars
and since Lucas was trying to do that,
this is a success for him even if he gets all these
criticism.
It tries extremely well with the other episodes.

658457,4,6303454038,"I think the movie itself is one of the most unjustly maligned movies of all time. It wasn't that bad. Sure, there were parts that were lacking, but ultimately we're dealing with different Star Wars movies here. The prequels. They're not meant to be like the old trilogy. It's more plotting and mystery than it is space cowboy adventures. And that's what I like about the prequels. The stories themselves are better and more well-thought out than the old trilogy. They're more involved and make you think. I will admit that there were some approaches taken with this movie that didn't work for everyone, but isn't that always the way movies are?
This movie is good. If you want to know what bad movies are, watch Blair Witch 2, or The Werewolf vs. The Vampire Woman. The Phantom Menace has faults, but it's not like the other Star Wars films DIDN'T have faults. All five are full of them, and I'm sure Episode 3 will be the same way.
The DVD itself has great special features. The highlight is the documentary ""The Beginning,"" which compiles hundreds of hours of footage of behind-the-scenes material into an hour long feature. It's very informative, and gives you a feel for what it was like making the first Star Wars movie in 16 years.
The other big highlight are the deleted scenes. You have the option to watch them along with a documentary talking before-hand about each deleted scene, explaining what it is, why it was cut, etc. Or, you can just watch them individually.
The rest of the DVD is full of other featurettes and such that are pretty cool, as well as TV and theatrical trailers for the film. There's also a blooper reel that shows outtakes, but it's an easter egg. You have to type in 11[enter], 3[enter], 8[enter] in the options menu. 1138 is from Lucas' first film THX 1138.

The ""Old Republic"" elder Kenobi spoke of in the original film is in its heyday - but dark times - they are coming.

The useless Republic Senate caused greedy businesses like the Trade Federation to protest on Naboo, a Republic planet. The Chancellor of the Republic then requested aid from the Jedi Council to restore peace in the Republic. Two Jedi Knights - young Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master - are dispatched.

Upon arrival on Naboo - the film's opening scene - the Jedi are attacked by the Trade Federation and escape to rescue Naboo's leader, Queen Amidala. It is then revealed that the Trade Federation are but mere pawns in a bigger game, one that involves the Sith - evil Jedi.

The Jedi flee with Amidala back to the Republic Senate and the Jedi Council for more help. Along the way, they fatefully picked up a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker, prophesized as the Chosen One.

658462,2,6303454038,"The film must be all of five years old now, but it hasn't aged well.  At best it reminds us of a time when there was a booming economy and plenty of willingness to experiment with computer animation and over-the-top costumes.  At worst, it shows off the side effects that nostalgia for a 1977 film creates in a movie produced more than twenty years later.  Yoda and Jabba were ridiculous-looking puppets in their time, and look even more plastic in Phantom Menace.  Red grease paint and horns are too juvenille for an ""evil"" character, even to a pre-teen.  Child actors with embarrassing line delivery are juxtaposed with seasoned professionals who really could have done better.  Entire digital landscapes were created from a computer paintbrush, so why'd you have to make them look just like the Hagia Sophia?  We are treated to a five-minute scene in a fascinating galactic Senate chamber before a white-haired fellow mumbles some nonsense about a ""strong"" Chancellor, and we cut back to more antics with Jar-Jar.  ""Comical"" battle scenes and ""funny"" explosions accidentally triggered by young Anakin rankle our hides in a post 9/11 world.  There is no point at which this movie is not fighting for air.  Natalie Portman once hoped that her role in these movies would not overshadow her future medical career and said she didn't know what she'd do if patients started calling her ""Dr. Amidala"".

658463,3,6303454038,"Episode One of the STAR WARS saga is actually a very entertaining film that does not deserve the bad rap it has taken since its initial release.  The plot, while confusing to some, is actually rather interesting and raises many question along the way that will be answered in upcoming installments.  George Lucas, who wrote and produced the saga, sets up many starting points for the following five films, laying the groundwork so to speak.  The only mistake being made here is that he relies too much on the viewers prior knowledge of later episodes in the saga, not considering that they will one day be viewed by future audiences in chronological order.  This actually begs the question, should the films be watched in their proper order or not???
Yes, the film does have some weaknesses, but it also has several strengths.  Sadly, many 'fans' ignore the strengths all together.  Liam Neeson is very good in the role of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn.  He is just as I have always envisioned the Jedi to be like in the days of the Republic.  It is obvious though that Director Lucas didn't know how to utilize Liam's extensive acting abilities for maximum effect, leading to some of his performance being a bit stagnant when it should have been heart felt.  I still enjoy his performance, but it could have been so much more!
Ewan McGregor was an excellent choice to play the part of Obi-Wan Kenobi.  He manages to do a wonderful interpretation of the late Alec Guiness, who originated the role in Episode Four (the original film), and really makes you believe that he is the younger version of the character.  Oddly enough, the choice was made by Director Lucas to cast Kenobi as a secondary character to Qui-Gon.  This relegates a character, whom many believe should have been the main character, to the sidelines throughout much of the film.  Regardless of this fact, Ewan still manages to give a fantastic performance.
Queen Amidala, played by Natalie Portman, is presented quite well on screen.  She properly exhibits and maintains the regality  needed for the role.  As Padme, however, she fails to deliver.  This is where the actual characterization existed in the script, but Natalie doesn't waste any time with it.  Every time there is need for actual emotion from Padme, she seems to just read her lines.  The scene in which she reveals her true identity to the Gungans and begs for their help is blandly delivered with disastrous results!  I like Natalie Portman and think that she is a good actress, but I will never understand why she couldn't put forth some type of effort in this pivotal role.
Young Anakin Skywalker, the central figure of not only this film but the whole saga, is  portrayed this time around in a most under whelming manner by Jake Lloyd.  There are three factors that contribute to the failure of his performance.  First, the character of Anakin was given some rather badly written dialogue that the best of actors would have trouble dealing with.  Secondly, dealing with a child actor sometimes requires the director to actually work more closely with them in order to get a suitable performance out of them, which I get the feeling George Lucas doesn't bother to do.  Thirdly, I don't think that little Jake was really up to the role from the beginning.  Yes, he may be a cute kid and all, but cute doesn't cut it when you are the central character of the film!
JarJar Binks, a much maligned and hated character portrayed by Ahmed Best, is the main reason for so much hatred being heaped against this film.  Though his character is outlandish and irritating to an extent, he also has several truly humorous sequences that tend to be forgotten or ignored.  He is not as detrimental to the film as many make out.  Basically, if you dropped the more cartoonishly portrayed elements of him, and cut back on the scenes of his cowardly, bumbling behavior during the land battle, he would be much more likable.
The action scenes are mostly well done here, with two sequences that steal the show.  The pod race midways through the film is a very exciting experience filled with lots of edge of your seat thrills. That, and the light saber battle during the finale between the two Jedi and the villainous Darth Maul which is also very exciting.  It is one of the most beautifully choreographed sequences done for the saga yet.  The land battle with the battle droids and Gungans is pretty good, but suffers a bit from JarJar antics and excessive CGI.  Too bad the space battle during the finale didn't get as much attention as the other showdowns did.  From script to screen, it suffered the most with silly accidental scenarios that ultimately win the day for the good guys.
Some of the deleted scenes available on this DVD release have been re-inserted into the  film, including elements from the Pod Race Grid Sequence, Pod Race Second Lap, and the entire Coruscant Taxi Trip.  These are good inclusion to the film, helping to tie certain scenes together a bit better.  I would like to have seen the Waterfall Sequence and Farewell To Jira put back into the film, but those will have to remain as extra features.  The other scenes are of little importance and better left on the cutting room floor.
 In the end, THE PHANTOM MENACE is a good film.  It captures the spirit of adventure that makes these films fun, though it crosses troubled waters from time to time.  It isn't perfect by a long shot, but it is still a credible entry that is much better than people want to make it out to be.  Three years later Episode Two would improve on many, but not all, of the problems encountered here.  In the mean time, beware of the excessively critical 'fans' and their vitriolic comments!  3  Stars!",1077494400,2,5720,4.687374749498998
658504,3,6303454038,"There has been so much back and forth about how this movie sucks, or how great it is. I want to make a few points clear.
1) A movie is not great just because it's ""Star Wars"".
2) A movie is not great just because it has magnificent CGI
3) A movie is not great just because it has lots of action.
The Phantom Menace is actually not a BAD film. It's an enjoyable movie if you're expectations aren't so high. In other words,
1) Don't expect characters like Han Solo, Leia or Luke to appear. The people in TPM are very different (and thank Lucas for that)
2) Don't expect a beginning - end story like A New Hope. This film is made keeping in mind the vast amount of plot it has to cover to reach .... well, you know (let's not spoil it for people who are new to this series). In a sense, this acknowledges Episode IV as the core of the series. I agree.
3) Don't expect a nasty Darth Vader type nemesis. The title ""The Phantom Menace"" obviously does not allude to a character named Phantom (I see the misunderstanding arising from the comic book Phantom connection). The phantom menace is the overhanging darkness that can be seen in the film, it's the first forming of the future empire, the first step towards total hopelessness in the galaxy (I don't think I've given anything away). So the title is actually very fitting, and suits the film well.
My complaints about the movie are these, though.
1) I think the acting is sub-par. It's not consistently bad, bu it's strange that with so many acclaimed actors (Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Pernilla August, etc.) this film never really engages you. I do think it has more to do with G. Lucas, since he's directing (and the acting quality has actually gotten worse in the sequel).
2) The film is so overlaiden with plot that we never really get to know the characters, we never have a chance to fall in love with them. One mistake I think is that G. Lucas wanted to tell the story from the beginning. I think skipping parts of the plot (especially time-consuming bits that don't reveal much character) and trying to incorporate the information through, say, flash backs, or other ways might have been benefitial.
3) Ultimately, and I think this is falls mostly on Lucas's shoulders, this movie doesn't know whose story to be. A New Hope was Luke's story (and then we got to know the other characters) and in a way, The Original Trilogy centered around Luke, the same way that the Prequel Trilogy should center around Anakin. But in this first film he rather gets overshadowed by the political story. Not that it's a bad political story, but it makes the film less personal.
So what DO I like then?
1) It's a beautiful film, incredible visuals and a treat for the eyes.
2) It has exciting action sequences, well choreographed battles and duels.
3) It has great CGI, and gives us a clue of how the beloved Star Wars story started.
If you see my first three point you'll understand why this makes it merely mediocre. I suppose this film is better thought about than watched.
As far as the DVD goes, it's very well put together, with great picture and sound, and many extras. The prime reason for getting this DVD, though, was for the documentary ""The Beginning"", where G. Lucas raves about JJ Binks being the KEY to the movie, saying he's probably the funniest characters in the SW series. Also we get to see the screen tests (or auditions) for the last three choices for Anakin, where Jake Lloyd does the worst job of them all, quickly followed by G. Lucas's rave about this talent ""He's perfect!""
If you're short on money, get something more worthwile, like Pirates of the Caribbean, Indiana Jones series, or Lord of the Rings (or the Original Trilogy as it'll be available September 21, 2004). You might even want to get the book version. If you have some money left over, though, this movie won't be the gem of any collection, but it won't bring shame over it either.",1076371200,2,3913,4.497191011235955

658506,2,6303454038,"After a long, long wait, many of us finally got to jump into theatres and watch the beginning of a fantastic tale about good and evil.
 The film suddenly starts with master Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his younger apprentice, the up and coming Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). They are sent by the Senate to negotiate with the Trade Federation, on board one of their many battle ships that illegally surrounds the Naboo system. The Jedi are distracted as a group of delegates and Vice Roys ploy a plot. I thought that there would be some slick looking villans in vests and gear. Instead, we have three human sized guppies with robes that Hugh Hefner would love and head dresses that look worse than Burger King paper party crowns. They order the Jedi to be killed.
Right after I realized who the Trade Federation leaders were, my stomach began to turn in frustration. The worry sat in quick.
Their assasins are an armed group of popsicle stick-limbed droids that say hardly anything than, ""Roger-roger!"" and who's rusty voices are in serious need of WD-40. These guys are the enemy? Our two lightsaber wielding Jedi slice and dice them better than a 'Ginsu' can chop celery, and make their way down to the planet that's already been invaded. Their run in with a clumsy reptillian-man named Jar-Jar (and a jar head he is) starts to water this film down quickly. There's no big threatening villans, no eerie mystery, only characters that are paper thin and a story that's got too much to deal with at once.
They find the captured Queen Amidala (a bland Natalie Portman) and take her (with two tag teams of hand maidens) to space, and after an outboard R2-D2 (what's he doing in this???) saves their cruiser's shields from a Federation ship's barrage of lasers, they make their emergency escape to Tatooine.
The title is still something everyone wonders about, and I gave the movie the benefit of doubt that he's a soon to be. So, on with the show.
Anakin Skywalker, is discovered. A slave to a gang of Hutts, him and his mother, along with nearly completed C3-P0 (oh, brother) help the outlanders win their needed parts in a pod race that's better than Days Of Thunder! Anakin is only freed, but encouraged by his mother to go and seek out a life with the Jedi.
The emotional impact or character development is pushed aside by fancy creature spottings and errand-like tasks that everybody is doing from the beginning. You don't get to know anybody at all, and the actors (minus a lame Portman and tin can Jake Lloyd) really try their best at a script that gives them 'a job to do'. The animation and effects are truly spectacular. With an Oscar nod again for that department, they keep up their 'Ind. Light And Magic' legacy.
Then there's the Phantom Menace. ""Phantom"" is right. Except for the last half hour, you don't see or hear him, minus a minute here, and a minute there. Worthy of the movie's title? No way. He does pack a whollop in a sabre duel with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan that can rival all three of the original trilogy's sabre fights COMBINED, with great choreography that was much needed before. The Jedi council is so underused, and Yoda goes from a wise yet funny little green eared Jedi to a grouch on a chair. On the other hand, Watto, the small grumpy swindler who runs the parts shop, is a blue winged creature with a hairy nosed trunk. He is the funny one, not Jar-Jar, and talks like he comes from an Italian pasta place. I do find McGregor to be a well played and placed dead ringer for a young Obi-Wan, so kudos to George Lucas there.
All of the humour, filmmakers stying and magic that built the original episodes are lost in this boring entry that was suppose to introduce us to their world with depth, and not just push them into view.
Great effects, shallow script writing, and uninvolved moviemaking are all that 'Phantom Menace' gives. The force, is not with this one.",1075939200,3,3898,4.592539454806313
658507,3,6303454038,"A film by George Lucas
After years of watching and rewatching the original Star Wars trilogy, the first of three prequel movies was released in 1999.  Episode I: The Phantom Menace was a long awaited, and highly anticipated new (and first) chapter in the Star Wars Universe.  The previews teased of what was to come and it looked good.  After finally seeing the movie in the theatre, I was filled with part excitement and part disappointment, and the more I thought about the movie, the less excited I was about it.
This opening chapter presents us with a trade blockade on the planet of Naboo by the Trade Federation.  Two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are sent to negotiate a settlement to the blockade, but they are attacked by droids employed by the Trade Federation.  Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon end up on the planet of Naboo and become entangled in the local political situation with the blockade and rescue Queen Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman).  They also acquire a tagalong alien named Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best).  More about him later.
The Jedi and Amidala, along with Jar Jar end up on Tatooine (yes, that Tatooine).  They are helped out by a little slave boy named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), whom Qui-Gon believes is the one spoken about in some prophecy about ""the one who will bring balance to the Force"".  The rest of the movie is a mixture of Tatooine, and the attempts to free Naboo from the Trade Federation.  We see the Jedi Council for the first time, featuring Yoda (Frank Oz) and Mace Windu (Samuel L Jackson).  We see the remnants of the Sith, Darth Sidious and Darth Maul (Ray Park) and their plots against the Jedi and their manipulation of the Trade Federation.  We see the first meeting of C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker).  We see the Old Republic that was, and the corruption of the Senate.  ""The Phantom Menace"" is truly a set up.  After watching this movie, we have a very good idea of how the Republic becomes The Empire, and we are introduced to key characters like Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi.  We even get to see the Jedi fight as true warriors, rather than two old men in ""A New Hope"".
There are some very exciting sequences in this movie.  Seeing the Pod Race on the big screen was rather impressive, and the lightsaber duel between Darth Maul and the two Jedi was the best lightsaber fight of the entire series thus far (without knowing what is in Episode 3).  I didn't even mind all of the talk about Trade and the Debates in the Senate.  So, what was my problem?  The movie was filled with a cast of capable actors, but the dialogue was so bad that I don't think anybody could have done a good job in delivering the lines (Pernilla August, as Shmi Skywalker was a notable exception for most of her scenes).  It was the writing.  Star Wars has always been on the simplistic side, with some silly lines, but for whatever reason, nothing seemed to work.  Add to this the issue of Jar Jar Binks, and it makes things a little bit worse.  Jar Jar is a character designed to appeal to kids.  He felt like the answer to Yoda, directed at small children.  But, he was rather annoying to adults, rather than being cute or interesting, as Yoda was (and is).  Jar Jar's clumsiness also negated what could have been a powerful battle scene between the Gungans and the Droid Army.
Why do I keep watching?  Because at the end of the day, it is a Star Wars movie, and my love of the original trilogy compels me to watch.  My expectations were so high that I acknowledge it would be difficult to meet them.  This was an enjoyable movie to watch, and it finds new life on DVD.  This is a 3 Star movie, and while I was disappointed, I still kind of liked it.",1073260800,3,3751,4.496307237813885
658508,4,6303454038,"When Episode One came out I saw it the first day.  So I do like Star Wars, and expected a great movie.  Many others have complained about various aspects of this movie.  There is plenty about episode one that is definitely different from the original three.  Many reviewers have commented on how bad they thought the film was.  But my review is not going to focus on the complaints.  Here are the good things:

DVD quality -- This DVD has unimpeachable quality.  Picture, sound and features.  It has lots of extras.  It is a very well done DVD!  Trailers, TV Spots, Deleted Scenes, documentaries.  Bravo!  The menu is interesting/entertaining and there is a lot of material.  The commentary adds a lot of bits and pieces to the Star Wars Lore.  You won't be disappointed with the bonus material.

The Music:  Williams familiar Star Wars score is on target again, and the choral parts in Episode One really highlight the danger of the Sith Lord Maul when he makes a wordless dramatic entrance.  The music is great, and almost serves as part of the story.  In fact Lucas speaks of the music in the commentary.

The Origin of Star Wars:  Complaints notwithstanding, this film introduces us to the Galaxy far far away, to the Galactic Senate, the Jedi Council, new worlds like Coruscant, Naboo, Tattoinne, and sets the framework for the whole Star Wars epic.  For all those who complain about EP 1 - the story has to begin somewhere, and Lucas fills us in all these things.  The story begins to show who Luke and Leia's parents are, what the deal is with Jedi, Yoda, Obiwan and dark Jedi.  We even get introduced to some central characters of later films -- Artoo and Threepio.  And most importantly, we see Anakin, whose descent into the dark coincides with the rising of the empire.  What causes Anakin to turn to the Dark Side?  Episode 1 sets the stage to answer this question in a Galaxy not so different from our own, with Aliens, Starships, Bureaucracy, Conquests, Honor, Intrigue, Evil, and Brave Protectors, both Jedi and other heros.  There are still some gaps and gaffes -- the notion that Anakin was miraculously conceived and the whole talk of midiclorians as the source of the Force seem improbable or weak.  But the story does provide a beginning.

Effects:  It looks awesome!  You may have trouble taking it all in, and should watch the film a couple of times.  Each time you can notice additional details.  The cutting edge effects in Ep 1 are now seen in other big films like LOTR and Marvel's offerings (Hulk, DD, Spidey, Xmen).  Another point --> People hated Jar Jar.  The fact that you can dislike a CGI character speaks volumes of the skill of the creators.  Also the scenery was brilliant.  Naboo and Coruscant especially are just beautiful.  Tell me another film that lets you visit worlds such as them?  Underwater Gungan City?  Awesome.  Locations too were gorgeous, and a large part of the story, just like the music.

Lightsaber Battles:  Remember the scene where Maul stands in the hangar door.  He says nothing and yet effectively screams ""I AM OPENING A BIG CAN OF WHOOP*SS ON YOU BOTH!""  That is an awesome scene.  Prior to this, we had never seen such a saber battle.  Not Errol Flynn, the Musketeers or the best Chinese Masters had shown us such a duel - ferocity, talent and effects.  The CGI, stunts, acrobatics, scenery, music, and tempo are awesome.  And when the laser field prevents the chase from continuing, the look of hate on Maul's face and the calm of the Jedi Master is excellent.  It really shows the fury and peace of light and dark.  Many have derided this movie, but this climatic scene is an outstanding piece.  Episode One's battle between the Jedi and Sith Lord is better than any lightsaber duels previously seen.  EP II's massive Jedi battle is likewise exceptional, but less personally intense than the duel between Qui Gon, Maul and Obiwan.  Ep III's jedi battles improve upon this.

The Pod Race:  Spectacular Action on Epic Scale.  The DVD has deleted scenes of the race with optional commentary which make it a little clearer that the race is really 3 laps long and shows some extra footage.  The Pod Race is like the Superbowl of the Lucas Galaxy, so why shouldn't it be grand, action-filled and intense?  It is.

The very end of the movie:  As the credits end, you can hear Darth Vader-ish wheezing.  Did you listen for it?  Haunting. . .

Hope you enjoyed these things about this DVD too.  There's been too much complaining.",1073174400,,4485,4.659411011523687

Okay Jar-Jar was not as bad as many had made him out to be. He was a hyper-realistic CGI character and George was also touting us that Ep. 1 was just going to be a set-up for the triology and all has been forgiven with Ep. 2 which has some of the best Star Wars battle sequences ever seen and is a way darker than this move.
Ep. 1 is like Ep. 2 *lite*. In fact it is lite in nearly every department but the final battle scene is worth the ticket alone. Not a great film by any means but not a total flop either.

The characters had awsome potential!  JarJar the exception of course.
I found young Anakin a little too great and thought the emaculate conception idea was a little trite.  And I felt the queen seemed to be comming on to Anakin rather then ""Aren't you cute"" response.
The best part of the whole film was the the light saber fight between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan, and Qui-Gon.
George gave a great villian and then killed him off!
The film failed due to the poor story line.  George tried to wow people with the race which was long and looked interesting but he it took away from the story line.

658577,4,6303454038,"Following a 16-year hiatus from the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, writer/director/producer George Lucas returned with the beginning of a new ""Star Wars"" trilogy set years before the events that take place in the first trilogy.  This set of ""prequels"" (as the term was coined) begins with the 1999 film ""Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace"".  In this film, the Empire does not yet exist.  Instead, the galaxy is governed by the Republic, whose main political body is a large, elected assembly of representatives known as the Senate.  The chief executive, known as the Chancellor, has very limited powers and is elected by the Senate.  Unfortunately, due in part to its size and countless political interests, the Senate operates extremely slowly and is incapable of making quick decisions when necessary.
Such is the case with the planet of Naboo, which is headed by an elected queen, Queen Padm Amidala (Natalie Portman).  Naboo is under threat of invasion by a group calling itself the Trade Federation, which is headed by Viceroy Nute Gunray (Silas Carson), because Queen Amidala has refused to sign a peace treaty with it that would ultimately deprive Naboo of its sovereignty.  Naboo's senatorial representative, Senator Palpatine (the returning Ian McDiarmid), is able to have Chancellor Finis Valorum (Terence Stamp, who played ""Bernadette"" in the 1994 Australian film ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"") send two Jedi to Naboo to broker a peace agreement.  Upon the advice of a cloaked individual known as Darth Sidious (also Ian McDiarmid), the Viceroy orders that the two Jedi, a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his teacher Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), be ambushed upon their arrival to the Federation starship.  However, they barely escape to Naboo's surface along with the Federation's invading droid army.  On Naboo's surface, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon meet an irritating, non-human Naboo native named Jar Jar Binks (voice done by Ahmed Best) who helps them obtain transportation to Queen Amidala's palace without being noticed by the invading droid army.  Once there, they help the resistant Queen escape the planet's surface (along with Jar Jar), but damage to their ship forces them to travel to the desert planet of Tattooine instead of the Republic's primary planet known as Coruscant.  On Tattooine, their search for replacement parts leads them to a winged individual known as Watto (voice done by Andrew Secombe), his very young slave, Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) and Anakin's mother who is also enslaved, Shmi Skywalker (Pernilla August).
As with any previous ""Star Wars"" film, the cinematography and special effects used in ""The Phantom Menace"" are excellent; but sadly, the writing and dialog are pallid.  The film's two biggest problems are the character Jar Jar Binks and Jake Lloyd's portrayal of Anakin.  When George Lucas released the previous ""Star Wars"" film in 1983 (""Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi""), he introduced a bunch of furry little creatures known as Ewoks.  Many people found them endearing, but some found them annoying.  In similar fashion, Lucas created an underwater species on Naboo known as the Gungan, of which Jar Jar Binks is part.  Unfortuneately, the Gungan's Jamaican accents and immature vocabulary made them (especially Jar Jar) far more annoying than endearing.  As for Jake Lloyd, it is very strange that with so many fine, young talented actors, that Lucas would select a highly animated and unconvincing actor to portray one of the film's most important characters.
There are, however, many memorable scenes in the film that partially make up for the film's inadequacies including Obi-Wan & Qui-Gon on the Federation starship, views of Naboo, the pod race, Qui-Gon's first encounter with Darth Maul (played by Ray Park, voice by Peter Serafinowicz), Queen Amidala's address to the Senate, Anakin standing before the Jedi Council that is headed by Yoda (voice done by Frank Oz), the Gungan/droid battle, the Naboo castle invasion, and the final battle between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon with Obi-Wan.  Other memorable characters include C-3PO (the returning Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (the returning Kenny Baker), Sebulba (voice done by Lewis Macleod), Captain Panaka (Hugh Quarshie), Jabba the Hut and Boss Nass (Brian Blessed).
Overall, I rate the double-DVD version of ""Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  The additional DVD includes many fascinating clips of how the film was made, including the creation of Darth Maul and the choreography of his fights.",1069286400,,4547,5.211248285322359

Reminds me of the struggle of the State of Israel, and it's courageous people, to survive against the machinations of the United Nations, European Union, Non Aligned Movement, International Media, World academia etc.
Portman is lovely and vivacious, with an unforgettable smile.
Queen Anakin refuses to abandon her people in their hour of need and stands against the powerful forces rather than yield.

658580,4,6303454038,"Phantom Menace was long awaited.  Lucas made a BIG MISTAKE in waiting so long to move back into bring the Star War Sagas to film.  The long long wait caused so much anticipation that I think before this movie was cursed with high expectations, so HIGH that it set up everyone for a BIG disappointment.
I have watched the film repeatedly, and I am left with the feeling - Lucas, you had ALL THESE YEARS, and this is what you settled for?  And I do mean settled.
Time has passed and we are Special Effects ""trained"", so the power of Light and  Magic is sort of ho hum now...we except bigger and better and when we get it we go...is that all there is?  It would be curious...had Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones been released all those many years ago would they have impressed us more???
One only has to look to the brilliantly conceived and executed Lord of the Rings movies to see the ability to thrill us is there.  What is the different? - THE CHARACTERS.  You care so much for the struggles of Frodo, Aragon and the others...and in caring everything about the movie becomes more real, more vital.
You have a hard time caring about the characters in Both of the New Star Wars movies.  When you don't care, you are left with Special Effects.  They are great, but there should be writing and acting to SUPPORT THEM.
I enjoy the performances of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, but on the balance the sparkle has dimmed on the force.  The original movies worked because YOU CARED.  Think back when Harrison Ford was being frozen and the expression in his eyes and the expression in Carrie Fishers....they is what kept the movies special in everyone's heart.
One hopes the final instalment of this trilogy gets back to that.  Fun time, but it will not live long in your heart as a special film.  And please,GL, pay a little attention to better dubbing.  At times, this has plagued both films.
A fun time...but leaves you thinking you were somehow shortchanged.",1068336000,,1962,4.505649717514125

Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace es una pelcula impresionante. Llena de CGI (Imgenes creadas por computadora), pero que no molestan en absoluto. Es ms, enriquecen la historia. Lucas sigue siendo un muy buen contador de relatos fantsticos, por mas que muchos digan que est viejo, que no puede dirigir, y que esta pelcula apesta. Particularmente, no me parece que apeste, y pienso que, aunque es posiblemente el peor episodio hasta la fecha, es todava un muy recomendable film, incluso mucho mas que The Matrix, que es del mismo ao, y es una copia del comic ""The Invisibles"" del maestro Grant Morrison.
Me parece que Lucas cambi mucho en todo el tiempo en el que se dedic al ocio (hizo algunas cosas como productor, pero estamos hablando de su rol como director), y no est ese Lucas de antes mucho mas fresco, y juvenil. El tiempo mata todo. Lucas ya no es mas joven, hay que admitirlo. Est viejo, si, pero bien. Ve las cosas de otra manera. No s por qu los fanticos clsicos de la Triloga Original (yo, lamentablemente, no soy uno de ellos...) se horrorizaron tanto con este episodio. Si bien la historia es un tanto ingenua, est muy bien contada, y tiene muy buenos personajes (como Qui-Gon Jinn y Darth Maul, por ejemplo).
En fin, Star Wars regres, y es probablemente mejor que todo lo que da vueltas por ah.
Ahora esperemos con ansias Episode III... que probablemente sea la mejor pelcula de la galaxia (por lo menos de sta...), y en la que veremos la cada de Anakin al Lado Oscuro... y el comienzo del verdadero Seor Oscuro...",1067472000,2,1666,4.556666666666667
658632,2,6303454038,"Yeah, I know I'm a little late on this but in 1999 when I saw this movie for the first time I was so disgusted I promised never to watch it again. Well, after a couple of years on DVD I decided to give this one another chance.  It really didn't deserve it.
The story is very simplistic.  Two Jedi Knights (Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi) are called to settle a trade dispute.  The planet Naboo has been invaded by the greedy Trade Federation and they demand that Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) sign a treaty giving them control of the planet.  Amidala flees the planet with her guardian Jedi and they have to repair their ship on Tatooine.  There they meet Anakin Skywalker.  Who just like Jesus was born to a virgin mother and may be ""the chosen one"" that will bring balance to the force.  Anakin is a slave and is freed after a long pod race in which he wins.  After this Anakin, the Queen, the Jedi, and our friend Jar Jar travel to Coruscant so they can pursuade the galactic Senate to intervene against the Trade Federation on their behalf.  Meanwhile Qui Gon Jin takes Anakin to the Jedi temple so Anakin can obtain permission to recieve Jedi training.  A very cranky Yoda says the boy is too old and dangerous to become a Jedi.  The very cranky Yoda orders Qui Gon to return to Naboo with the queen to protect her.  Back on Naboo a really big battle is fought and Qui Gon Jin dies and then Obi Wan kills a Sith Lord named Darth Maul.  Qui Gon has a funeral then there is a big celebration. The end.
Okay, so the problems.  There is not an interesting character in this entire movie.  They are lifeless figures on screen whose dialog only serves to keep the plot moving along.  There is no real villian.  Darth Sidious spends the entire movie hiding in the shadows giving threats and Darth Maul only serves as a plot device to kill the Jedi.  His screen time is minimal and his character is hardly developed.  As a villian he has nothing on Darth Vader from the classic trilogy.  Another problem is Anakin.  I watched the documentary ""The Beginning"" and to be honest Jake Lloyd was the worst one who did a screen test.  I have no idea why they chose a kid who couldn't pronounce a lot of the words in the script.  Speaking of that documentary, Rick McCallum the producer serves as kind of a yes man to George Lucas.  His job is to tell the documentarian how great the movie is going to be.  I guess he gets paid a lot and his job would have been lost if he had been honest and said the story was terrible.  Then there were the Trade Federation guys.  Yeah, I know, a lot of you hate Jar Jar the most about this movie but he was not nearly as annoying as these Trade Federation guys.  They wear mask that look as if they were purchased in a dime store and talk in bad Asian accents.  When they guys are on screen I wonder if I am watching a Star Wars movie of the Power Rangers?  Okay, a lot of people think the saving grace of this movie is that Pod Race.  The Pod Race was modeled after that chariot race in a movie called Ben Hur.  But in Ben Hur there were real actors on real sets.  Not some kid in front of a blue screen.
Just like Star Wars and Return of the Jedi, there is a battle station fight at the end in which our heroes most destroy the station.  And if you have no life like me you will have noticed that ROTJ ended with a funeral pyre, a celebration, and then end credits.  TPM also ends with a funeral pyre, a celebration, and end credits.  George Lucas had not directed a movie since the original Star Wars and it showed in this movie.  This movie is too mediocre to deserve the honor of a one star rating.  I give The Phantom Menace two middle fingers up.  Way up.",1067472000,3,3691,4.196301564722617
658633,4,6303454038,"I had to reconsider both my original review of this flick and ""Clones"" after having actually watched both movies w/I a week of each other.  After the initial letdown of ""Episode-I"", I was ready to jump on the ""Episode-II"" bandwagon.  In retrospect, while they both share some flaws, in many respects ""Menace"" is actually superior to ""Clones"".
""The Phantom Menace"" has a comparatively simple plot - an intergalactic commercial group called the ""Trade Federation"" suddenly turns militant in the face of burdensome taxation.  They blockade the backwater world of Naboo, threatening an all-out war if their demands aren't met.  Why the Federation has taken that strategy is a mystery to the ruling government - the Senate of the Intergalactic Republic.  Because the galaxy is largely at peace (except for pockets of lawlessness) there is no standing army.  Instead, the Republic relies on the Jedi Knights - warriors schooled in the power of The Force - to maintain peace.  When Jedi Knights Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) find themselves unable to forestall a war, they rescue Naboo's elected ruler Queen Amidala (Portman) from certain capture.  Having escaped the Federation, Amidala's damaged ship is forced to make emergency repairs on an even more remote planet - Tatooine.  Needing parts to fix their ship, and with nobody willing to accept their Republic Credits (even when prodded by Jedi mind tricks), Qui Gonn and Padme (one of the queen's loyal handmaidens) enlist the help of a local slave named Anakin.  He's just a kid, but even Qui-Gonn can tell that the boy has the power of the force flowing through him.  Soon the quest to repair the ship and escape to the Capitol of the Republic includes a mission to save Anakin as well, determine the nature of the Force energy coursing through him and to evaluate him for entry into the Jedi.
This flick was a letdown in many ways, but it does have some qualities that survive repeat viewings.  Visually, it is spectacular - the final dogfight between the Federation and the Naboo was not topped or even equaled in ""Clones"".  Both films have epic battles involving computer-animated combatants, but the Gungans have more character than the clone army (though I wouldn't want to face-off either side, ridiculous characters are better than none at all, and the clones are utterly lacking in that area).  The story is simple - though the more complex plot of ""Clones"", with its many continuity lapses and gaps reveal that its makers have a narrative problem which is best served by keepings things simple.  Both films are marked by an epic Jedi duel, though the one in ""Clones"" was strikingly unspectacular.  Christopher Lee as Dooku also demonstrated that he can function quite well as an all-around lord of Evil in ""The Lord of the Rings"", but the script gives him little to do, and the story can't make up its mind as to whether we're supposed to think he might be good, or banish any idea that he's not utterly evil.  In contrast, Ray Park as Darth Maul is utterly drenched in evil, his face and body language communicating a very palpable sense of the Sith - the force of evil Jedi ready to tear the galactic order to shreds.  Maul's battle royale - alone against Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan easily rivals that between Vader and Luke from ""Return of the Jedi"" in its narrative coherency, and is only clearly topped in that respect by Luke and Vader's duel from ""Empire"".  While we can lament that ""Episode One"" wasn't the kind of film that grabbed us from our first viewing (like ""Star Wars"" or ""Raiders"") it's still a film that can grab us.  Just make sure you give it some room, and wide-screen DVD with which to do it.",1067126400,,3687,4.794628751974724

658636,5,6303454038,"When word came out that George Lucas would be making the three prequels to his STAR WARS trilogy, word-of-mouth was roused, and so was the hype and advertising. The year 1999 saw the release of the first of these prequels, THE PHANTOM MENACE. But even though it was the biggest moneymaker of its year, the film has split STAR WARS fans and critics of every kind alike. While some critics and fans jumped out in favor, a majority of others attacked it savagely and condemned it as a disgrace to the franchise. Even to this day, THE PHANTOM MENACE is mentioned with growls of disgust and/or disappointment. Almost everywhere I go there are many who take turns slamdunking this movie and badmouthing George Lucas.

As a longtime STAR WARS fan, I do agree that the original trilogy is a tough act to follow, but I don't think Lucas deserves the negative backlash he got from this film (and its follow-up, ATTACK OF THE CLONES). Sure, it's not the Second Coming like many expected it to be, less lively than the other three films (in other words, more slowgoing), and heavily reliant upon state-of-the-art CG effects for much of its shots. And the characters are not as appealing as their predecessors, and, yes, I COULD have done without the digital flatulence gag. But do I think STAR WARS: EPISODE I--THE PHANTOM MENACE is everything the disgruntled folks say it is? Do I think George Lucas has gone greedy and decided to squeeze every last ounce of cash from the franchise?

No on both counts. The truth of the matter is that THE PHANTOM MENACE is a visually amazing movie. Every time I watch it, I am just in awe at the computer-generated setbacks, designs, and bizarre alien characters -- something that the previous STAR WARS movies could accomplish by miniatures, animatronics, and/or pyrotechnics. This was exactly the kind of technology Lucas would have wanted to use in order to make STAR WARS more than 25 years ago, but of course that was not possible. (This is why he made those ""SPECIAL EDITIONS"" of the films incorporating new footage and/or special effects shots.) Seeing this movie is almost like watching Lucas letting his imagination run wild; a lot of the sequences are both spectacular and invigorating, particularly the underwater journey through Naboo's core and the Pod Race on Tatooine. But my favorite part of the movie is the climactic lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi VS. the demonic looking Darth Maul. This battle is oustandingly staged and choreographed with impressive stunts and swordplay at its most swashbuckling.

Moving onto the plot analysis, yeah, I can understand why some would think the characters (including a younger Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Queen Amidala) may not be what viewers best remember them as, but I'm not sure if Lucas was really INTENDING to make these movies in the same carefree spirit as, say, A NEW HOPE was (although there ARE some great one-liners, though spoken in a somewhat campy manner). Especially since the first three movies involve Anakin's descent into Darth Vader. This first movie features him as a young kid, played by Jack Lloyd. While his acting is a bit awkward in places, he didn't really detract me from the movie at all. He does display appropriate gloominess and has a somewhat distant look in his eyes, something that is ominous enough to remind us about what will happen later on. I loved Liam Neeson's performance as Qui-Gon Jinn, and Ewan McGregor is a great younger Obi-Wan. Natalie Portman is also a capable young actress doubling as Queen Amidala and her alter-ego Padme. Ian McDiarmid, who played the Emperor in RETURN OF THE JEDI, is bang-on yet again as Senator Palpatine. The rest of the characters are, shall we say, somewhat underdeveloped. However, this is best to be expected, since this is supposed to be the beginning of it all. This also could explain why there are some plot points left unresolved by the film's end (Who's Darth Sidious? Where did Darth Maul come from? What's the deal with those Trade Federation guys?). Most of these loose ends are tied up in EPISODE III--REVENGE OF THE SITH, which probably explains why the whole movie is difficult to evaluate individually.

Probably one of the biggest reasons why a lot of people hate this movie is the inclusion of the CG-created comic-relief Jar Jar Binks, played by Ahmed Best. Just about everywhere I go on the net do I see his name mentioned with death threats and utter annoyance. Speaking for myself, I actually LIKE Jar Jar Binks. I think he was an interesting new character for the movie, but there were times where I felt he was overused. I didn't have the same problem with his pompous ruler, Boss Nass; while he speaks with the same ""offensive"" dialect as Jar Jar, his deep voice, provided by Brian Blessed, more than made up for it.

But while many people have come up with arguments about hating Episode I with a passion (or even the other side who speaks in favor), it has been continually hard for me to do so. True, it's not perfect, and yes, there are some scenes I would have cut out, but I still have found no legitimate reason whatsoever to dislike this movie. It's still STAR WARS, after all. And even though I don't think THE PHANTOM MENACE is on the same level as the original trilogy, I think STAR WARS at its least is ""OK"" and, after seeing REVENGE OF THE SITH, I now see what place it has in the saga--this is the beginning of a six-part saga which will nonetheless be a bumpy ride.  And as it progresses, one will find spectacles worth revisiting as well as occasional dead space.  But it's a ride which ultimately has its rewards.

As the first STAR WARS movie to be released to DVD, THE PHANTOM MENACE is, on a technical and visceral level, a knockout.  The 2.35:1 video presentation is pristine and gorgeous, the audio rocks through the speakers, and there is a whole slew of extras (from deleted scenes to behind-the-scenes featurettes) to please film buffs and collectors alike.  I look forward to seeing future Lucasfilm productions receive a similarly fabulous treatment.",1064620800,4,6094,4.767772511848341

The little boy playing Anakin Skywalker is suffering from the curse of Skywalker.  It seems everyone that has been set to play a Skywalker has been a terrible actor.  For both of the recent Anakins, the casting directors have taken in lifeless actors that only have one of many qualities needed for the role.  Mark Hamill also was not a good actor.  He played Luke Skywalker of the original trilogy.
I have seen the second Star Wars prequal and it was a lot better.  I feel even the acting had improved somewhat.  I only hope that the third will be as dark, funny and exciting as the orginals.

658673,2,6303454038,"Well, the first Star Wars film in over 20 years and it turned out to be rubbish. My expectations shattered in 2 hours. Actually no make 45 mins after Jar Jar Binks appears.
First, the good points. Neeson is pretty good in this and rather convincing as a thoughtful older Jedi. Palpatine is good too and subtle in his creepy role.
The effects for the most part are well done, more convincing than in Ep2 actually. But everything looks too new and shiny. A problem that has yet to be solved with CGI. The ships in the originals are MUCH more convincing. They look used.
Emmmm....now some of the bad points.
As already mentioned, Jar Jar Binks. Well, single handedly, almost, this absolutely AWFUL character ruined what would have been an average first installment to the new trilogy. He must have been thought up when George [was not well], because I cannot imagine anyone with any kind of writing skills or imagination finding this stupid clunky, idiot being remotely funny. In fact the Gugan's as a whole were a terrible idea. But its indicative of how George Lucas's mind works. Take the Ewoks in ROTJ for example. Originally Endor was a planet of Wookies, but Georgy Porgy changed it to little teddy bears. Why? MONEY. He knew that they would be a hit with stupid people and kids. Therefore generating money. Ewok was a household name, but its not mentioned once in the entire film. Obviously Lucas hoped to replicate this in Ep1.......and FAILED miserably. JAR JAR BINKS IS NOT FUNNY. He also does not deserve to be in any film, never mind a StarWars movie.
Ewan McGregor....well, hes ok. He tries hard to be a young Alec Guinness, but unfortunately I just cannot see him bringing out any of Ben Kenobi in the film.
That bloody kid! Oh my God. When I first saw the poster I thought that maybe he'd be good. He looked moody and with the shadow of Vader behind him, I thought that the new trilogy would be a gloomy and grim affair, WHICH IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. But instead Lucas decided to make a kiddies film, with a kiddy star! This child is onscreen TOO MUCH....FAR TOO MUCH. I just wanted to slap him. And that pod race.....com'on he's a child....I don't care if he's got Jedi reflexes. Its just way too hard to suspend my disbelief.
Portman is beautiful, but like Jar Jar doesn't belong in a Star Wars film, but for different reasons. She just looks bored by the whole affair, like she is in Ep2. And that stupid ""twist"" of her being replaced by her handmaiden.....what?
The ""droids"". ""Roger, Roger"" indeed. They are brutal, unconvincing and absolute no threat whatsoever. George has chosen to make the enemy a useless army of Microsoft bug ridden foul ups. Can anyone imagine an army of these idotic machines actually winning any battle?
All in all, if this had been directed by somebody else, with a tighter script and an actually threatening ""menace"" then it would have been an ok introduction to the new trilogy. But as it stands, it is not worth buying. Juat so it doesn't interfer with the original trilogy.
I wonder if George could go back in 20 years and edit out the Jar Jar Binks scenes, like he did with the original Star Wars, only in reverse. Instead of putting in an awful representation of a character (Jabba the Hut), he could take one out and improve the film immensely.

Of course, people are entitled to think whatever they want; I just feel that they're judging The Phantom Menace based on 16 years of their own expectations rather than judging it for what it is: a visually stunning space-fantasy popcorn flick. The battle scenes outdo anything in the original trilogy! I'll grant that it doesn't have the underlying heavy mythology of the original movies, but that's because it _is_ the underlying heavy mythology of the original movies. The plot is kind of convoluted, but you should be able to make sense of everything if you pay close attention. If not, just enjoy the visuals.
The DVD itself is outstanding. The picture and sound are perfect and there are plenty of extras, including an hour-long documentary focusing on the making of the movie. Rick McCallum is hilarious. My favorite extra is the first web featurette, showing George Lucas going to work on his first day of writing the script (November 1, 1994). The deleted scenes are great also.

You were a kid when you watched the first one, so there is no way that you can recapture that essence of youth now with this movie. Going back and watching the first one (episode four) this one is not that bad, its actullay pretty good. The fight scenes are great, the graphics and special effects are better than anything else at the time, only episode II has better.

Its very interesting to see how everything came about, the movie is a little dark, in the episodes 4-6, the good guys win, this one there are little defeats. The character devolopment of Obi Wan is more interesting to see than that of the Kid, they do that in episode II. The political nature of the film is a bit dry and boring, but its needed to get to the point. Bottom line, its a good film, I have it on DVD, because its a really nice DVD to own. It makes full use of the DVD technology.",1059696000,,1226,4.1991525423728815

To me, ""Phantom Menace"" is just a mess of bad script writing, weak acting by the cast, and just mediocre dialog. The storyline was weak and sadly, ""Phantom Menace"" damaged my faith in the Star Wars prequel trilogy until ""Attack Of The Clones"" came along.
The Pod Race scene though in my opinion was extremely awesome and saved ""Phantom Menace"" from hitting the bottom of the garbage can.
Still though, overall, ""Phantom Menace"" in my opinion, adds nothing to the legendary Star Wars saga.

658733,5,6303454038,"Granted, this installment of the illustrious Star Wars series may not boast the completely unexpected, jaw-dropping impact which the original trilogy had on its now diehard fans, but the fact remains: Star Wars: Episode I has been badly mistreated in the ranks of its one-time supporters.
The plot is not undeveloped, the casting is not mischosen, and its place among the Star Wars saga is not unsure.  On the contrary, this film is a very fitting continuance of the story fans fell in love with so long ago; it has the plot dripping with mystery, suspense, and intrigue, the characters complementing the story with their unique additional personalities, and the very Star Wars-like conclusion, which begs for the story to be completed in the final two films.
  This movie is not at all badly written.  The plot flows smoothly from one scene to the next, and even dons unique characteristics.  The Jedi phenomenon is explained in much more detail (what some critics claim is ""mumbo-jumbo""), and the audience is given more glimpses into their amazing abilities (i.e. Qui Gon and Obi-Wan speeding through the hallway, making daring leaps from ledge to ledge, etc.).  The lightsaber  battle(s) with Darth Maul brag incredible imagination on the part of the choreographers, and are absolutely dazzling to watch.
  Overall, this film is brilliantly written and made, bewildering movie-goers with gut-wrenching suspense, a deeply woven plot, many unexpected twists and turns, and incredible special effects; with very special mention to the newly written music scores by none other than the genius John Williams.  And while it boasts all of the characteristics that make for an awesome spectacle of a movie and addition to the Star Wars saga, loyal Star Wars fans are turning their backs on it and not appreciating it for the aesthetic genius it is.
  Don't think it lives up to the first three Star Wars films?  Don't compare it to them.  It is profoundly different, because it is meant to be.  It tells the story within the story, and was meant to be much different than any Star Wars ""fans"" would expect.  It's a different time, different place, you must remember.  That means different people, different places, different tales.  Be fair people.

658808,4,6303454038,"*Note*: I am not a die-hard Star Wars fan nor do i really like George Lucas and nor do i have stocks in any Star Wars stuff but this a good film....
I really can't stand people that have a vision of how something should be in their mind and if a movie doesn't emulate that they tear it down. How many times have i heard people whinging about this film. George should have done this....George should have done that...George has ruined my childhood .....blah blah blah....
Star Wars is and always was George's vision not anyone elses. He creates the foundation, the story, the characters and the evolution of this series. Granted other directors and writers have come on board but they all admit in countless documentaries that they always stuck with what George wanted in these films.
He is the master they were his tools.
So you saw a bunch of B-Grade sci-fi movies when you were a kid and have now developed some obsession over the meanings and memories that the older 3 sequels give. WAKE UP !!!!! Its a new century and a new Star Wars has imersed itself into the Galaxy.
Star Wars: Episode One is a good film told from a child's perspective to wrap the beginning of the story of Anakin Skywalker with innocence and wonder. For those who say that this is a child's film...well HELLLOOO...its meant to be, the film is about a child and the birth of the Empire. Its all about beginnings and beginnings are normally more subduded, (the stroy not the visuals). The visual are colourful and at the time of release alot of it was new, just like viewing things from the eyes of a child. This is a foundation movie meaning that alot of expostion has to be dealt out.
Furthermore, those that complain about the acting are clearly not understanding the nature of the people in these films. The acting is typical of Star Wars, ( i mean Mark Hamill always acted like he was in amatuer theatre),  and the child that played Anakin was perfect. You all seem to want a brillant child actor that can pour out adult like mannerisms and drama, excately how a child WOULD NOT ACT. I think that Anakin displayed good child like features and came across as a child not a small adult. This provided Anakin with a good sense of innocence. Yes. some lines were wooden but its STAR WARS, they always have been.
This episode is to set up a transional line between good and evil. I believe that the vision here is to start with good (Ep 1), move into both good and evil, (Ep 2), and then too evil itself, (Ep 3). The other 3 movies, (4,5,6), are a mish mash of good vs evil. It doesnt question the power of either besides Luke's internal struggle in Return Of The Jedi. You either are good or evil. The new movies however seem to question everyones motives and you can't help but feel that the new ones are more complex, not just visally but also story wise. I tend to think most people hate the story because it either too complex for them or too slow. This is a 6 act play really with two major storys, the tale of Anakin Skywalker and then the second half, the tale of his son Luke Skywalker. Try to separate the two distinct halfs. Luke story was told in the late 70's and 80's. Not only was the special effects more minumal then but i believe the story lines were too. It was just the good fight the evil. Granted these movies did it very well but the new ones are better. The political undercurrent is beautifully set out in Ep 1 and shows how democracy can be utlised for more evil intentions. There just seems to be an overall richness to the story that was lacking with the orginal 3.
Most seem to find that they don't like Ep 1 but like Ep 2 better so it only makes me think that everyone is just waiting to see the moment Darth Vader returns to the screen. Personnally i am enjoying the experience getting there. I do not go into these films trying to over anaylis or comparing them with my childhood experiences of the first 3, i don't compare every detail to what is clearly a confabulation of memories based on the first 3 films that a saw has a child and grew up with. I enjoy these films as orginal pieces of work that add not suntract from the overall mythos.
Episdoe One is a good film, its a good beginning but remember it is George's vision, not yours, not mine but his and he doesn't owe diddly to fans. If you don't want to see his vison stick to Star Trek. Don't see the films or make up yah own world and mythos, i mean many have tried and many have failed to copy the Star War theme but at the end of the day these films are huge because most people want to see the next chapter. If u want to make a film and have your vision then do it otherwise pay yah cash and see a good film and get hooked to a good legend that consists of 6 parts.
Episode One : TPM is a wonderful, entertaining film and the DVD only hightlights the work, imagination and skill that goes into making such a film. George Lucas comes across as a strong and confident man who has actually listened to the fans, ( i wouldnt, pack of nerds really), and created a DVD with every behind the scene aspect of this film that anyone could want.

658809,1,6303454038,"Just a few years after its release, it's hard to believe that Episode 1 was the most highly anticipated movie event of the twentieth century. Like Christmas morning, it turned out that the aching anticipation and season's spirit were far more affective than the event itself. And just as we don't recall right off what we got last Christmas morning, Star Wars Episode 1 isn't mentioned when we sit around with friends and talk about our Favorite Movies Ever. But camping out at the theater that summer--yeah, that was awesome.
Episode 1 was a colossal disappointment, and not just because of Jar Jar Binks. If that were the only reason, Episode 2 would have been great--instead of just its special effects. Some reasons why Episode 1 was terrible (let's hope George Lucas reads this):
1. No central villain. It should have been Darth Maul. Remember him? And he wasn't even cloned in the sequel... What we got for protagonists was a couple of alien viceroys with the most ridiculous b-movie Japanese accents. Ugh
2. Stupid plot that was mostly politics. Trade federations, senators, political manuevers, blah. How can you screw up a story about Jedi knights rescuing and protecting a queen, while coming across a Jedi prodigy being held as a slave? How can you ruin such a great premise? ANYONE could have written that plot better than how it was done.
3. A cardinal rule of movie-making: don't have children do drama. The last thing we want to see is a little boy doing a Marlon Brando role.
4. The characters we loved most--Obi Wan, Darth Maul, Qui Gonn--had smaller roles next to the teen queen, little boy, Jar Jar, and viceroys. And Yoda wasn't very wise.
5. Is meesa forgetting anything else? Exqueeze me.
Pretty special effects are no substitute for a ruined story and uninteresting characters. It's difficult to say, though, which is the worse Anakin: little boy or whiny teen. I don't think I'll be the only one to say, ""Thank you lord,"" when he finally puts on the black cape and kills Mace Windu. And hopefully Padme too.
  But my hopes are higher for Episode 3. The way I see it is this: Episode 1 appealed most to 12-year olds, Episode 2 was for 15-year olds; if this is a pattern, Episode 3 will be for the crowd of 18 years. And that's not so bad. Right there with every other special effects action movie.",1052956800,5,2320,4.65609756097561

658812,5,6303454038,"In this first episode of Star Wars Lucas is once again an innovator. He uses the new possibilities that computerized imaging and creation propose to devise a completely new generation of films. These new tools enable him to freely create hundreds of beings, settings and even situations that could otherwise never be created. He takes great pleasure in the creatures he can create. In a way he is god. So he creates all kinds of monsters, aquatic or land monsters. He also creates intelligent beings with physiques that have little to do with man, and yet they walk and behave in many ways like human beings. Actually he used human models and then created the computerized beings from these models. These new tools also enable Lucas to set up tremendous scenes with strange machines and breath-taking races. This gives to the film a completely new dimension that is pure pleasure for the viewer. At the same time, in this first episode he introduces some characters we have met as older characters in the later episodes, but now in their young age or infancy. We can finally understand why and how the empire appeared and why and how the republic was destroyed. Lack of unity in purpose in the Republic. Democracy hijacked by bureaucracy in the Republic. The desire for a more effective and faster government in the Republic. The desire of the merchants, the industrialists, to impose their commercial rules to everyone and to conquer markets free of any taxation to increase their profits. Finally the ambition of some to seize that power and impose their own will over the whole galaxy. The Jedis are very powerless in front of such a decaying situation in which private interest is taking over collective interest. This film also has a great emotional value with the kid who has to leave his mother, who is freed and has to abandon his mother in slavery, because this Republic goes along with slavery on some planets.

Some of the plot elements don't even jive with what Lucas filmed years ago. Anakin created 3PO? The Force is a bunch of microbial entities in your bloodstream? Anakin was an immaculate conception?

There are a ton more features to this relatively mediocre movie title. The (...) extra film cell hardly makes up for that. Also, Jar Jar is still annoying and the plot has some holes, but at least on the DVD suffering can be at a minimum with the skip feature. But let's be honest what we really want with this movie is a way to relive what we all really love in the original Star Wars trilogy. It is evident to me that after seeing this movie and Episode II that Lucas CAN NOT direct or motivate actors to save his life. Empire and Jedi were pulled off so beautifully because others directed them. If you look to the first of the series (A New Hope of which most of you simply call Star Wars) the same directing flops are present and bad acting reigns supreme.

658923,4,6303454038,"I am an avid Star Wars fan.  I grew up on Star Wars.  I still have the original Kenner action figures and I'm not even thinking of selling them on auction websites.
When I heard that George Lucas was going to reprise his role as a director and work on the prequels, I was extremely excited to see how everyone got there, how Anakin Skywalker transformed into the evil Sith lord Darth Vader.
In ""The Phantom Menace"", we are introduced first to the young Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and his master Jedi, Qui Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson).  Then we are introduced to (we all know this by now) the mother of Luke and Leia Skywalker, Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) at 16 years of age. Finally, we get to meet Anakin Skywalker at 10 years of age (Jake Lloyd...could they have cast a better child actor?).
A lot of people blasted ""The Phantom Menace"".  I have to disagree.  This is an inside look into how everyone started.  And if you are a big fan of the original trilogy, you should be able to appreciate how George Lucas tells the tale of how an innocent child is transformed into pure evil.
There are no real outstanding acting performances in this film, except for Natalie Portman and the outstanding fine Ewan McGregor.  It is so exciting to see how the Jedis were at this time frame because in the original trilogy, they were always discussed and during that time, I would always wonder what the Jedi were like in their prime.  Of course, we only see two of them here, but we just see how strong they are in using the force, and the treat in this film is seeing the Jedi Temple and the Jedi Council.
I can't wait for the third prequel to come out.  One day, when that DVD comes out, I will play all DVDs in sequence!

658924,2,6303454038,"It's taken a good number of years to arrive at a final opinion about ""Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace"".  After vacillating between the good and bad of the movie, it is my final opinion that ""Phantom Menace"" is a tremendously disappointing movie that not only is aggravating to watch in its own right, but also heavily damages epic scope and mythos of the original trilogy.  This movie still warrants two stars because there are still some excellent visual scenes and it is Star Wars, but this is too much of a letdown to recommend to anyone.

While it is true that no movie could live up to pre-release hype generated by the George Lucas hype machine and 16 years of anticipation, ""Phantom Menace"" fails on its own merits.  Where, exactly, does it go wrong?  Well, the first obvious problem is the acting.  Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are excellent actors in their own right.  Yet, there performances as Qui-Gonn Jin and Obi-Wan Kenobi, respectively, are wooden at best.  Obi-Wan seems like he's around just to remind people of the earlier trilogy.  He does very little and carries none of the presence he did in ""A New Hope"".  The computer-generated character of Jar-Jar Binks was gross miscalculation by Lucas.  Jar-Jar comes across as nothing more than an attempt to pander to a younger audience (which he did successfully with the Ewoks in ""Return of Jedi"" without hurting the movie), while aggravating the older core of Star Wars fans.  When a character utters lines that sound like they're from Stephanie Tanner from ""Full House"", you know there's a problem.  However, the biggest acting disaster the performance of Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker.  Young kids are capable of acting (see Haley Joel Osment for example).  Jake Lloyd is not one of those kids.  All of his lines come across as incredibly forced and incredibly whiny.  Some of his scenes are so cringe-inducing that I had to turn away from the screen when they happened.

Acting, alone, is not the only place ""Phantom Menace"" went wrong.  It seems that Lucas lost his understanding of the intangible elements that made the original trilogy to special and magical.  The climatic scenes in a ""Phantom Menace"" are nothing more than a rehash of the climatic scenes from ""Return of the Jedi"".  There's a space battle scene that includes the 'out-running the ball of fire' sequence from ""Jedi"".  Yet this scene is decidedly indistinct and lacking in drama.  There's a ground battle scene that pales in comparison to its ""Jedi"" counterpart, and there's a lightsaber battle that, while more technically proficient than the Luke/Vader showdown in ""Jedi"", it carries none of the importance or emotion.  Luke was fighting for his father's soul.  Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan's battle with Darth Maul seems perfunctory and without significant meaning.  This was all done so much better in ""Return of the Jedi"" and yet it seems as though Lucas thought he could recapture that amazement by simply recopying the elements.

Alas, it gets worse.  Lucas also made some extremely questionable plot choices in ""Phantom Menace"".  One of the more aggravating ones was to give the 'Force' and biological basis in the form of midi-cholorians.  In the original trilogy, the 'Force' seemed like a mysterious, magical energy field that influenced all there was in the universe.  Here, it seems like a simple biological anomaly that can be easily tracked and understood.  This really damages the mythology of the 'Force'.  Another bad plot twist was making it so that Anakin was the creator of C-3PO.  This seems incomprehensible in the original trilogy and appears to be thrown in to make everything more convenient than it should be.  The final ludicrous plot development was the suggestion of Anakin being of a virgin birth.  Implying that he is a Jesus-like character is equally as offensive as the 'slave-language' of Jar-Jar and the stereotypical Asian accents of the Trade Federation.

The timeline of events also doesn't mesh particularly well with the original trilogy.  It all feels like it fits together in fashion that is too neat and tidy.  The magic of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy was created as much from what we didn't know and learned from conjecture versus what we did know.  With the prequels, Lucas chose to answer a number of questions about Star Wars past that were better off left unanswered.",1049760000,2,4363,4.931412894375858

During the course as we all know, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon meet a young boy named Anakin Skywalker, and they want him to train him to become a Jedi Knight but Yoda objects believing that Anakin is a serious danger to the Jedi and the galactic republic.
They also meet a mind numbingly loquacious amphibian being named Jar Jar Binks. While I don't necessarily dislike Binks nearly as much as most others, I thought that he was incredibly annoying on some occasions and almost felt like an extra character from a rejected kids cartoon show put onto Star Wars compared to the rest of the characters. On the other hand though, Jar Jar makes up for it though with some funny moments on an otherwise dark movie and is almost like the extreme opposite to the two main villains Darth Sidious and Darth Maul. The latter was a bit disappointing to me. It's not that Maul was one dimensional or showing little or no malice, quite the contrary, it's disappointing that THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH OF DARTH MAUL!!! I expected more of a role from him than what I expected. For that reason, I can't help but say that that was the main disappointment that I had with this movie thus taking a star off the ratings. Darth Maul though during the moments the spotlight focused on him, was awesome and the face definitely shows the extreme malice that he had in him. I even remember being Darth Maul for Halloween a few years ago but let's not change the subject of the review. Darth Maul though was one of the best characters on the movie and came off intelligent and evil and not just a background character. If ""Phantom Menace"" becomes forgotten in the distant future, Darth Maul though will be remembered. Padme Amidala, the one with the fancy Asian-style make-up, actually is a special decoy used by the real one who is played by Natalie Portman. I actually liked the fancy decoy version better as she looked more like a leader but the real one isn't bad either. Young Anakin Skywalker though was one of the best kid characters on a movie that I've seen in a long time, showing lots of bravery for someone so young. It's kind of odd how a 9 year old Anakin could actually build a racing pod vehicle! I thought that Jack Lloyd did a great job playing the young Anakin Skywalker. All of the surviving characters would improve on ""Attack Of The Clones"".
R2-D2 and C-3PO also meet and began their long friendship. This might sound odd but R2-D2 and 3PO, I've always liked more than most of the human characters in ""Phantom Menace"". To tell you the truth, I even like Jar Jar Binks too at times despite his sometimes highly bumbling character performances.
There is quite a bit of mumbo jumbo in the movie and it tends to sink the movie down a bit but the special effects though are absolutely stunning and stupendous, thus making up for the unnecessary mumbo jumbo. The battle scenes I thought were awesome to watch and lifted this movie off the ground of mediocrity. The sceneries and numerous landscapes though are visually stunning and the Senate Room was a visual feast. The Pod Race was probably one of the best sci-fi action movie scenes that I've seen in many years at the time of this movie's release. Even so though, ""Phantom Menace"" suffers from poor plot development in some occasions and even some downright bumbling moments and these render it more for the Die-Hard Star Wars fans. I had relatively low expectation of this movie but despite being quite flawed and occasionally silly, it turned out to be a great movie and the opening chapter of Anakin's descent into the dark side. Still though, even I cannot deny that this was slightly disappointing in some areas. It's nowhere near the heights of the Episodes IV, V, & VI and even ""Attack Of The Clones"" was better but this movie could've been much, MUCH worse but overall, despite the major flaws to it, this is not a bad Star Wars movie. I think of it as more of a large bag of potato chips or popcorn and a can of soda as opposed to a mind-blowing epic masterpiece like the original three. ""Phantom Menace"" could've used better plot development and greater roles from Darth Maul but for the first chapter though, it's more like lying down of the foundation of the next five episodes. This movie only scratches the surface of what was to come on the Episode II and the cataclysmic events that'll become the backbone of Episode III! Overall though, ""Phantom Menace"" once it's finished will leave you hungry for more. Not a bad job from Mr. Lucas. I simply say that this is a great and astonishing movie, plain and simple!",1049673600,3,5530,4.581231079717457
658926,5,6303454038,"What is so awful about this movie? All I've seen at this site is DISTURBINGLY negative reviews of it, calling for the torture and death of Jar Jar Binks and calling the movie a ""steaming heap of refuse"" or words to that effect. Are you people SERIOUS?! Qui Conn Jinn I have to wonder about, granted, but Natalie Portman, for her young years, is an excellent actress....She seems much more mature than the 20 or so solar cycles she's seen.
Yes, granted, Jar Jar Binks is a pain in the [...], but for my money, C3PO is STILL the most irritating character in the Star Wars pantheon. Why is he even THERE? R2D2 is the robot that usually pulls everybody's fat out of the fire at the last minute...what has 3PO done? Saved Luke and Han from the Ewoks in ""Return of the Jedi""? I think they and Chewbacca could have eventually handled them.
Anyway, back to ""Phantom"". While I take pains to defend the film, there ARE a few things wrong with it, some MAJOR things, not the least of which is Qui Conn Jinn's fawning interest in little Annakin! For instance, a little too much of it is reminiscent of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" in the beginning, especially as Qui Conn, Jar Jar and Obi Wan leave Gungan.
Speaking of Gungan, I like Boss Nass as a character, with his odd speech pattern and facial tics. Very original character concept, if you ask me. Schmi Skywalker is also a great character, (""Schmi""?! Why was she named after a villain in ""Peter Pan""?) She exudes a tranquil persona that permeates every scene she's in. Pernilla August handles this part beautifully. WHY was she killed off in ""Attack of the Clones""??
The art direction....? Nonpareil! Though not the equal of ""Attack of the Clones"", if ""Phantom"" didn't win the 1999 Oscar(r) for art direction or visual effects, a fix was in for the actual winner, because few movies can equal this or its sequel for pure visual mastery. (Or pure cheek!)
The plot? What was wrong with the plot? Granted the pathos and strong feelings from ""New Hope"" aren't there because THIS IS NOT ""NEW HOPE""!! This movie didn't have the luxury or inherent specialness of being the founder of a film dynasty and institution, and it does put some light on the beginnings of Annakin Skywalker/Darth Vader and what made him so special in the eyes of the Jedi and the Empire. Sorry, but we will never again see the image of the remains of Beru and Owen amongst the ruins of their smoking residence, or Luke's stunned reaction to it. Never see Luke blow up Deathstar with the spirit of justice guiding his every move. Never see him shreik in outrage as his own father kills Obi Wan Kenobi right in front of his eyes. Never see Princess Leia surprise Han and Luke by firing a gun like a pro that first time. Nope...never. Deal with it.
This movie could have been garbage, like ""Return of the Jedi"", which is, as far as I'm concerned, the REAL stinker amongst the Star Wars films! Lucas certainly didn't have to exert himself for the bucks, now did he? However, I will put this up against ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"", ""Ghostbusters II"" ""Alien Resurrection"", ""Batman & Robin"", ""Star Trek: Insurrection"" and any ONE of Spielberg's little money factory originals or sequels any day of the week for quality!
About the only other thing that bugs me about this movie and ""Clones"" together is that Ewan McGregor is NOT a convincing young Obi Wan. Forty-five, fifty years ago, Alec Guiness pretty much looked, sounded and acted as he did in ""New Hope"" to ""Jedi"". It's impossible to imagine McGregor developing Guiness' distinctive speech patterns and mannerisms along the way to his dotage. Where's the nasal tone? The smirk? Believe me, nobody changes that much over the course of a lifetime, I don't care HOW much they age! All in all, NOTHING should prevent you from buying this movie...not the condemnations of fanboys, not the homicidal sentiments toward Jar Jar Binks or anything ELSE! Buy this for what it is...another great addition to THE Royal Family of popcorn movies!
THEN...analyze it!",1049414400,3,4013,4.653521126760563
658927,4,6303454038,"The Phantom Menace
Although Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is supposedly, as most film critics and many fans have said since 1999, a disappointing prequel to perhaps the most popular film trilogy, I think it is an enjoyable and yes, even interesting ""origins of"" story. Like many Star Wars fans, I wanted to know how and why the Galactic Republic morphed into the evil Empire, how Senator Palpatine wormed his way to be Emperor, and most of all, how and why Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader.
I theorize that in the 16-year-gap between trilogies, fans had dreamed up scenarios far different from what we ended up seeing on May 19, 1999. Maybe they thought Anakin was a bad seed who went around wearing black and using the Force to choke other children....or that he was the Anakin we did finally get to see in Episode II, already a Jedi in training...I do know that there was grousing on three different topics, in order of ascending disappointment:
The movie was way too political.
Anakin was a 9 year old kid.
Jar Jar Binks.
There were also complaints about the pre-release hype (and maybe that was warranted) and that The Phantom Menace was really a commercial for Hasbro's related toy line (which may also have been warranted to some degree). But, for all that.....
The Phantom Menace is a fine Star Wars film! I was caught up in its storyline from the opening logos to the end credits. The characters, whether they were new ones (such as Qui-Gon Jinn, Padme Amidala, Shmi Skywalker, or even those CGI creations Watto and Jar Jar), or younger versions of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and the boy destined to be Darth Vader, gave the Classic Trilogy's story some depth and complexity. Finally we got to see the girl who will be Luke and Leia's mother....the Jedi Order and how Knights served and fought at the height of their power....and perhaps most revealing of all, how a powerful democracy could be replaced by dictatorship by clever insiders.
Maybe in part that is why Episode I somehow disappointed die-hard fans: at times The Phantom Menace does feel a bit like a civics lesson rather than space opera. I have not delved into all the message boards that gripe about TPM's shortcomings, but I suspect that most fans were expecting Palpatine's rise to power to be violent and sudden (like Castro's takeover of Cuba). George Lucas' intent was to illustrate how Julius Ceasar and Adolf Hitler took power: by using democracy's strengths against itself. Palpatine/Darth Sidious doesn't storm the Senate Hall in a 1917 Russian Revolution mode; he worms his way into high office by first weakening Supreme Chancellor Valorum in a manufactured ""scandal"" (which is detailed in Cloak of Deception, a novel by James Luceno), then using the crisis on Naboo - which he as Darth Sidious has conceived - to cause an election for a new Supreme Chancellor.
But if it did have its slow expository scenes, The Phantom Menace also had moving segments. The thrill of the Podrace....Anakin's sad farewell scene with his mom....Qui-Gon's appeal to the Jedi Council to allow him to train Anakin as a Jedi....the exciting Battle of Naboo on three fronts......This was Star Wars action at its best.
And yes, by Golly, I even like Jar Jar!",1049328000,3,3219,4.801801801801802
658928,4,6303454038,"If your a fan of the originals, you may be a little surprised by this film. It has some Star Wars qualities, but is very different. Special effects have taken control of this film, which is not a good thing. The special effects create most of the sets and scenes, making it difficult for the actors to do there job. This film also features some well, less than great characters. Jar Jar's humor is, well not funny unless your a five year old. This film is my least favorite Star Wars film (including ""Attack of the Clones""), but it still has it's moments. Natalie Portman's performance may not be her best, but her scenes, as Queen Padme Amidala, are some of the better ones. Including the Corucant scenes, which are only 15 minutes of the film. And the action scenes at the end are good, however Anakin's (Jake Lloyd) scene's in the spaceship, and Jar Jar's battle, can be annoying at times.
I really give this 3 1/2 stars but I rounded up, instead of down. And even if the movie isn't your favorite, the special features are great!",1047945600,,1033,4.470899470899471

  i liked this movie.  liam neeson was great as the jedi, qui-gon jinn and has become one of my favorite star wars characters.
it was funny to see a young obi wan and i thought ewan mcgreggor was quite good as well.  I loved queen amidala and have always loved natalie portman.  she was amazing as with the rest of  the cast.  the actng was great, i loved the story, the effects and the whole kit and kaboodle.
  the story begins with the invasion of the planet naboo where we meet queen amadala.  along the course of the movie we pick up jar jar binks played by ahmed best.  he plays the comic relief role for the movie.  some people (myself included) find him annoying.  others liked him.
  in any event, the movie rolls on and we pick up anakin skywalker who is to become darth vader down the road.  i thought the special effects were amazing.  i love this movie.  i am a sci-fi fan and a star wars fan.  some did not like this movie and i can see why.  it does have flaws but do not forget what future lies ahead and this trilogy has to build the future.  the groundwork has to be laid for quite a number of subjects over the course of three movies.  it is alot.
  the dvd is packed with stuff and i mean PACKED.  behind the scenes on virtually every aspect of the making of this movie as well as all aspects of the movie itself.  there are approximately six hours of features to plow through so you better have time on your hands.

I was ten years old when Star Wars came out.  I loved it.  I was obsessed with it, as was every other male kid in my class.  We spent all our time drawing tie fighters and x wings.  We couldn't get enough of it.  Now, Episode One is out and my two older children love it.  They are four and two.  I must admit that there is a certain nostalgic, time-warp savor in seeing my four year old son walking around in a Star Wars T shirt.  And for him and his two year old brother, Episode One is fantastic.  So for me to say that the movie is terrible and the characters are wooden and the accents are arbitrary and fly-by-night, that Liam Neeson should be publicly horse whipped just for being Liam Neeson, that whoever heard of a 6 year old kid making intricate carvings, much less flying a space buggy... all this is not to the point.

658931,3,6303454038,"The Phantom Menace DVD is excellent in terms of quality, extras, and fun.  However, as a die-hard Star Wars fan this by far is my least favorite.  It is not what we Star Wars fans are used to seeing or expect from George Lucas.  Jar Jar & Boss Nass are incredibly annoying and make Barney look like a cool dude.  There are so much CG characters and ships, that some of the scenes will make you dizzy.  Jake Lloyds performace is mediochre at best.  The Dialogue scenes go on forever and the mystical Force has been reduced to a genetic infection of micro-organisms called ""Midichlorians"".  The greater the infection, the more potential one has as a Jedi.  Even without all the extremely high expectations, this movie is a major miss in terms of what we should expect from ANY Star Wars movie.  On a positive note, Liam Neesons performance as Qui Gonn Jinn & the Lightsaber duel between Obi Wan & Darth Maul are superb.  The Pod-race is like watching a sci-fi version of the Indy 500 and is quite entertaining.  In my opinion, those are the only redeeming qualities that this movie has.  If you aren't a die-hard Star Wars fan, but want to see this anyway, rent it first.  If you are a Star Wars fan, you gotta have this DVD anyway because it is sadly the foundation for the prequels and the saga itself.  I recommend reading James Luceno's ""Cloak of Deception"" FIRST.  The book allows one to make a lot more sense our of the movie and you will have an understanding of the events that set this first chapter of the STAR WARS saga into motion.",1046563200,,1541,4.434163701067615
658932,5,6303454038,"As a child I loved the original Star Wars trilogy, and George Lucas has managed to ignite that feeling in me again with The Phantom Menace.  Set in the time before the original trilogy, The Phantom Menace deals with the struggle of the planet Naboo and its elected Queen, Amidala (Natalie Portman), to keep the ruthless Trade Federation from taking over their planet.  She is assisted in this by Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his Padawan student, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), along with a member of the underwater race of Gungans who share Naboo with the ground-dwellers, Jar-Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), who is swept up in their fight against the Federation when he is saved by Qui-Gon during an attack by the Federation droid army.  It is also the story of Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a child slave from the planet Tatooine who is brought before the Jedi Council on Coruscant when it is discovered that he might be the one who can bring balance to The Force, which is part of the Jedi philosophy.
One of the things that I liked most about The Phantom Menace is the supporting cast.  Ahmed Best was wonderfully funny as Jar-Jar Binks, the Gungan who unwittingly gets caught up in the quest of the Jedi and Queen Amidala, and I can't say more about Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker other than he was just perfect for the role.  Seeing Anthony Daniels as the pre-SW C-3PO was a delight--like Jar-Jar, he was very funny and helped to break up the tension in some of the scenes on Tatooine.  Pernilla August was a good choice for Anakin's mother, Shmi Skywalker, a woman who wanted to see her son fulfill his destiny, but who knew she had to let him go so he could do it.  I also liked Samuel L. Jackson as the enigmatic Jedi Mace Windu, and hearing Frank Oz as the voice of the wise but mysterious Yoda--well, he's always a delight.
My favorite supporting actor in Phantom Menace, however, is Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine, who is made Chancellor of the Galactic Senate when Queen Amidala calls for a vote of no confidence against Chancellor Valorum (Terence Stamp) for his refusal to send immediate aid to Naboo (McDiarmid also plays Darth Sidious, who sends his Sith student, Darth Maul [Ray Park] after Amidala & Company on Tatooine).  Although he appears to be a good guy, one can sense by how McDiarmid plays the role that Palpatine is a power-hungry despot who wants it all, thus setting the stage for his future persona as the Emperor.
The thing I like most about The Phantom Menace DVD release is the fact that it's a 2-disc set, with the movie and commentary on one disc and the extras on the other.  Having the extras on a second DVD leaves open the opportunity to include a lot, and believe me, there are loads of extras!  There is an hour-long documentary that takes you inside Lucasfilm and ILM during the making of The Phantom Menace as well as deleted scenes, a 12-part award-winning web documentary on the production of the film, the ""Duel of the Fates"" video by John Williams (which I can't seem to get bored with, and I watched it plenty of times when I was working in a video store), teaser and theatrical trailers and TV spots, and much, much more.
All in all, I have to say that The Phantom Menace DVD set is worth owning.  Not only is the movie a good one guaranteed to keep you entertained for the full length of its running time, but the extras will keep you from getting bored as well.",1045785600,2,3425,4.53484602917342
658982,4,6303454038,"The Phantom Menace was probably the most heavily anticipated movie in history. Since Star Wars hit the silver screen in 1977 I haven't heard many ask about how the characters got to where there were, but I didn't hear one complaint about possibly learning of the character's pasts as everyone rushed to the theater to find out. The final product failed to live up to the expectations set for it however.  Don't get me wrong the Phantom Menace is not a bad film, and the special effects are incredible, but the plot seems disjointed as it bounces around from scene to scene possibly confusing some of the viewers.  Not to mention that quite simply this episode just had some very big shoes to fill.
The cast did a wonderful job, and I couldn't have enjoyed the preformances more.  I was also touched by the fact that George Lucas stuck to so much of his original effects from the previous three movies.

But like I said, I've never expected good acting in Star Wars, so I'll gladly move on. The film is struggling to create an early Star Wars universe and for the most part does an okay job. While TPM is lacking in many places, the final battle is terribly exciting and well worth the wait of a little over an hour, during which there are peace talks, Jar-Jar Binks, and Samuel L. Jackson doing absolutely nothing interesting. But the final battle with Darth Maul is truly awesome and I even sort of liked the Gungan-droid battle.

The really good thing about this DVD is that it brought a new appreciation for what a massive project this movie really was. I still love Star Wars, but why is Lucas trying so hard to ruin what's been built?
Jar Jar remains ever annoying and the plot has some holes, but at least on the DVD suffering can be at a minimum with the skip feature. Let's be honest what we really want with this movie is a way to relive what we all love in the original Star Wars trilogy.
It is evident to me that after seeing this movie and Episode II that Lucas CAN NOT direct or motivate actors to save his life. Empire and Jedi were pulled off so beautifully because others directed them. If you look to the first of the series (A New Hope of which most of you simply call Star Wars) the same directing flops are present and bad acting reigns supreme.

658988,4,6303454038,"Solid good fun from George Lucas' fertile imagination that precedes the events in his 1977 blockbuster Star Wars (the second-most successful film of all time after Titanic at press time). In this episode, the story suffers from being overburdened by a strong emphasis on computer graphic animation: where the first three entries in the film series (which has practically become a religion for some) succeed because of their excellent character development and very tangible emotional quality, The Phantom Menace has a rather hackneyed plot and no truly sympathetic characters. Resisting the strain of this size a project can't be easy, though, and the film's stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Liam Neeson do exceptionally well, as does Pernilla August (The Best Intentions) in a supporting role. The plot involves Queen Amidalah (Portman) doing her best to ease difficult trade relations between unfriendly planets, and Jedi Knights (McGregor, Neeson) who after discovering a force-blessed young man named Anakin Skywalker (aka Darth Vader) are compelled to escort him safely back to the Jedi counsel for closer examination (watch for the scene where Anakin's mother talks about how she conceived him-it might remind you of something...) Jake Lloyd's performance as little Anakin is terribly weak (even for a child actor) and all the obvious racial stereotypes that Lucas indulges himself in (the shady vehicle salesman has an Italian mafia accent, and the duplicitous dignitaries from the outer reaches of the galaxy are distinctly Japanese) mar the clean enjoyment this film has potentially to offer. None of these myriad of criticisms, however, can compare to the sham of Jar-Jar Binks, a character who dresses like Lenny Kravitz and has an accent that can only make one think of Prissy from Gone With The Wind. Confirmation of his being featured in the next film of the series was met with dire disapproval. My favourite part of the film, at least for historical importance, is the part where C-3PO first introduces himself to R2D2: watching the start of my very favourite ... romance in all of film history almost leaves my eyes misty.

OK, the pod-race was really too long and Jar Jar Binks was slightly annoying but the film contained several great scenes as well. It is overall very exciting by itself and also as a part of the whole saga.
The DVD contains very interesting interviews with almost everyone and additional shootage. The images are clear, the sound spectacular and it is really a must have for the dedicated.

The special effects are great, the customs are beautiful and... there nothing more.
It was like looking a special effects presentation with poor dialogs, actors and a long so on. The worse of course, was Jar Jar Binks and all it's tribes... simply annoying, stupid and disturbing. The pod racer has great effects but i felt on a children movie with the two head creature narrator making jokes all the time, Java getting sleep and all sort of silly jokes.
Don't know what Lucas had in mind, but the history was the last anyway; is like the ending of the Return of the Jedi, too much idiot creatures (the ewoks) doing silly jokes and less smart and interesting dialogs.

Now, call me crazy but I liked it.  Sure, Jar-Jar gets on your nerves, and the acting isn't exactly the cream of the crop, but its Star Wars and in the end it does live up to its name.  Episode I had to be made to tell the story and to set the stage for the subsequent episodes.  The effects were (and still are) out of this world.  Lucas poured his heart into this, and it turned out to be stunning.  The Podrace scene is the big adrenaline pusher, and the lightsaber duel at the end is just plain cool.  We waited for this DVD, and we weren't dissapointed.  The movie looks fantastic.
 -SPECIAL FEATURES-
The Deleted scenes were really a joy to watch, and the little featurettes before them make it all the more better.  There are various ""Making-of"" documentaries, as well as the Web documentaries, but the one thing NOT to miss is ""The Beginning.""  It's an hour-long documentary that covers the entire scope of the making of Episode I.  Even if you thought the movie stunk, this documentary is a joy to watch.  I even enjoyed the Audio Commentary.
Overall, it was an OK movie, and a great DVD.",1039305600,,1105,4.389162561576355
659075,1,6303454038,"With the original ""Star Wars"" and its sequels, George Lucas didn't invent the dominant mode of filmmaking today, but he (along with Steven Spielberg) can probably be credited with perfecting it. That mode might be termed ""whiz-bang,"" where character and even plot are subjugated to spectacle and effects. What plot the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy had was essentially cobbled together in paint-by-numbers fashion from the work of Joseph Campbell, presumably in the expectation that recurring motifs in mythology represent universal metaphors of human existence and so can be used as templates for popular stories. If the grosses of these films were any indication, this expectation might have been right. Certainly the original trilogy had its moments, though it bears up less and less well as time goes on--the first movie, for example, while an occasionally exhilarating tribute to old sci-fi movie serials, seems to me now to be too filled with mindless, juvenile bickering; the second, grandiose in ambition but disappointing; the third, a puerile marketing ploy disguised as a film.
Unfortunately, ""Episode I,"" or ""The Phantom Menace,"" or whatever one wishes to call this movie, patterns itself more explicitly along the lines of ""Episode VI"" (or ""The Return of the Jedi""). The most pathetic example of this is the land race between Anakin Skywalker and a host of strange alien creatures on Tatooine, which runs on screen (or on TV) exactly as one might expect it to run on a video game console, which of course is entirely the point. The only reason for the character of Jar-Jar Binks to exist is to provide an excuse for another action figure; after a certain point, the cross-marketing examples are too numerous to bother with any longer.
More disturbing is the pervasive racist stereotyping in the film. Much has been made of the similarities between Binks and the old negro caricature Stepin Fetchit, but this was less obvious to me than the similarities between the evil traders and old-movie caricatures of evil Chinamen. The choppy Asian accents given to such characters were a little shocking to me, although it is possible to see how these characters were meant as an homage to (read: ripoff of) B-movies of the 1930s and 40s.
Overall, one gets the distinct impression that after taking the greatest of care with the digital animation and special effects, there just wasn't much time or effort left over for less important matters such as character or plot. Darth Maul is meant to be a sinister, evil figure; I know this is so, because he looks like a red demon, has the requistite horns on his head, and sneers at several choice moments. On the other hand, we are never given a real reason why we should believe he is so evil. My alternative interpretation of the film is that Darth Maul is a tragic hero.  Here, after all, is a hardworking individual so dedicated to his cause and loyal to his superiors that he will take on two Jedi knights singlehandedly just to help his allies in battle. Unlike ""Episode IV,"" where we at least got to see Darth Vader pull a few dastardly deeds, there is no real reason to believe Darth Maul is anything more than a dedicated servant to a misunderstood cause.  That this represents a plausible conclusion is one of the surest indications of utterly inept storytelling.
""The Phantom Menace"" is a George Lucas creation and an integral part of a ""Star Wars"" franchise that will defy any criticism in its uptake of money. It is also, however, a terrible film with all the depth of a carnival ride. Its popularity is probably an indication of the expectations of its audience, which these days rarely extend beyond such transitory thrills. If a thrill is all you need, by all means hop on the ""Star Wars"" ride. If you are more interested in a good story, a good film, or (heaven forbid) science fiction, look elsewhere.",1039132800,11,3867,4.857575757575757

The battle scenes are well done in CGI.. and the costuming and casting is superb for this.
There are two reasons that this movie received a 4 instead of a five.. One I felt that they dragged the intro of Anakin out wayyyyyyy to long.. there are a few things that could have been done differently to move it faster.. Second reason..

I'm still not too clear about some of the details but I find the idea of evil Empire interests taking over the Planet Naboo to be very interesting and not too badly done. Yes, Jake Lloyd as young Anakin is kind of a cartoon character, but then much of the time he does do all right for a boy. Some of his scenes, such as the Pod races and the space battle get very silly (an attempt to draw in the younger audience?)but most of the time I found his delivery to be good. Liam Neeson wasn't bad as Qui-Gon and I think Natalie Portman did a great job as Queen Amidala. The worst characters in my opinion were the invasion force leaders, they sounded just like the bad imitation Japanese/Chinese bad guys from some old 50's movies (and probably were meant to give that impression), and the Gungans (especially Jar-Jar Binks, although even he had his good moments). I suppose those were sort of intended to provide laughs, which didn't work very well for me. The story's not bad, most of the characters are good, the sets and effects are wonderful, I think this movie outperforms the three original movies in most ways.

659143,4,6303454038,"Lets start by saying that this movie will not live up to the hype that fans of the original trilogy have set. THE PHANTOM MENACE is an introduction movie, nothing more, so don't expect a really spectacular film. This is the first of the series, just like A NEW HOPE was the first of the original series, and A NEW HOPE wasn't that good either. In this first installment, we are introduced to the galaxy before it collapsed. The beautifully designed planet Coruscant is the home of the Republic and the home base of the Jedi Knights. Another planet, Naboo, the home of Queen Amidala and the gungans, is nicely designed to resemble a palace. And Tatooine, is a planet that resembles a home for the poor, also home of Anakin Skywalker. THE PHANTOM MENACE starts off in space where Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Won Kenobi are forced to settle a trade dispute, which happens to go bad. Then realize the Trade Federation is planning an attack on Naboo. Both head to Naboo to warn Queen Amidala of the attack. Then decide to leave to Coruscant where the Queen will be safe. But instead are forced to land on Tatooine where they meet Anakin Skywalker. The special effects are amazing. The pod race is absolutely great. The light saber fights are spectacular, and the war scene in space is really good. But the story is just a little confusing. Why does the Trade Federation want to start a war with Naboo ? I just don't understand. But THE PHANTOM MENACE delivers exactly what I had in mind, a decent first movie, which A NEW HOPE was as well. Let me say this, THE PHANTOM MENACE is just a setup. Thats it. A setup to what will be a great film. Just like A NEW HOPE was a setup to the spectacular THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. So just accept THE PHANTOM MENACE for that...

659147,5,6303454038,"The one thing that probably killed this movie was the expectations.  I myself partially expected a lot of stuff to happen right off the bat - but I was still amazed at the detailed array of special effects.  I think most other people weren't fazed, and even these days I've been thinking that this film does have a few flaws.
The biggest negative thing of this film is Jar Jar Binks, of course.  His antics can be embarrasing (but fortunately, this gut-wrenching feeling wears off after the trillionth time it's viewed.  I even have to be honest when I say that some of his goofiness is a bit funny...maybe mesa turning Gungan.  Doh!!!)
But the film itself has a good amount of action and adventure, witty (but sometimes flatulent) humor, and well orchestrated fight scenes.  The special effects are supreme for its time, and add a great amount of detail and flare to the space battles, the vast variety of aliens, and the immense ground battles.  The lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul is probably the best of the entire series.  The music score for the film is splendid.  The characters are well established (the TV spots on the DVD set actually embellish the characters).  The story line is well-crafted and sets up the next films rather well.
This DVD set includes extra footage reinserted into the feature.  It's not much, but still adds to the grandure of the film.  This disc set has some splendid deleted scenes (completed just for this release), and some interesting documentaries and galleries.
I'd say that despite its almost childish style, THE PHANTOM MENACE inaugerates the Star Wars series with gradure, a large scope, and a good story.  It's the start of a new era in Star Wars films.",1037923200,,1734,4.759197324414716

659219,5,6303454038,"Despite constant debate about the subject of the prequels, once you lay all that aside and look at the movie itself, you realize that The Phantom Menace is indeed a very good movie. There were some very big shoes to fill when Phantom was released and for the most part, people felt like there was something missing. As this movie ages however, I feel that it will begin to grow into those shoes.
Set many years before the first trilogy, Phantom Menace introduces the viewer to many new characters along with introducing us to younger versions of some of the classics such as C-3P0 and Obi Wan. The story becomes very interesting once the viewer sees the movie for a second time, after the initial shock has set in and settled down. The movie does a nice job of setting the groundwork for the next two and begins to answer some of the questions about Darth Vader's past. There are dazzling special effects, a very intelligent storyline and great action sequences. The light saber battles are incredible and leave even the most disgruntled viewer feeling pleased.
Most people would rather complain about something instead of enjoy it, eventually people will forget about their petty quarrels with the movie and settle down to enjoy the movie as well as the other two prequels.

This is a great movie, period, for many reasons and yet I read bad review after bad review, people calling it a ""B"" movie with A+ special affects. It's Star Wars for Pete Sake!!! Not one of the original movies was a literary masterpiece!! `Com on folks, lighten up and enjoy it for what it is... A Sci-Fi adventure, and it's supposed to be fun, light, ""un-real"" and have great special affects. This movie has those very qualities; squared!! Though I have to agree on some level that Jar Jar can get to be a little much. Also, I feel you never warm up to Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn. The only thing that I can come up with that is Jinn is a little ""mechanical"" in his demeanor and though he doesn't do anything to keep you FROM connecting with him, he doesn't do anything to win you over either. This could also be a direct result of Liam Neeson though. I've seen quite a few of his pictures and this is a common occurrence with the characters that he plays. Also, as a side note, I'm hoping that one of the films will delve more into the mystique of the Jedi night and the ""Force"". Now back to the movie... What made the first 3 so great was the ""newness"" that the films had! We, John Q public, had never experienced anything like it and the affects were so mind blowing that the whole experience was phenomenal!! But now, there has been so many of these types of movies; The Star Treks, Starship troopers, lost in space, etc (never mind the bombardment of space shows on TV)... That we never thought the new Star Wars would be another one in the pack; we expected it to be as ground breaking as the originals! This was an impossible feat and that's why it ""failed"" on some level. Also, the time between Return of the Jedi and the release of Phantom Menace probably caused the ""larger than life"" anticipation. It's a shame really, a good movie lost to it's own promise... The DVD is quite spectacular and one of the best as far as extras go. I'm not big on extras though; I just like the great Audio and Video. I'm a Home Theater owner and this is the very movie that fits HT!! The pod race is demo material and the luscious landscapes and horizons on the different planets are total eye candy!

659222,4,6303454038,"First of all I am an avid Star Wars fan and I really loved the orinigal trilogy. Me and my older sister an brother grew up with them (I was only 2 when Return of the Jedi came out). Anyway now to the review.
  The story is not that bad. But it was formulatic. But however the REAL story actually involves the Sith, Dark Jedis who after a thousand years of absence are now making the plot to take over the galaxy. He makes an alliance with the greedy trade federations who invades a planet called Naboo. You all know the story So I will stop here.
The acting was not bad at all but its not oscar calibre. Liam Neeson does a fine job as Qui Gon Jin. He is my favoriat charector in the movie. He is probably the most interesting person in he movie. He as a Jedi even questions his superiors judgement when it comes to Anakin's fate which is dangerous. Qui Gon (WARNING SPOILERS COMING) when he was a learner (Much like Obi Wan in this film) had a very dangerous Mentor (You will find out who he is later)SPOILERS END
The Special effects are outstanding, but they relied on it too much and that is not good for people can still tell what is fake and what is real. Also I did not like the battle between the Gungans and the droid army it was too static and not chaotic (Watch episode 2 and you will see what I mean).
But the DVD is Aweson it  has a lot of cool special features like trailers and documentaries.
My final thought. Unlike the orinigal Star Wars this movie cannot stand on its two feet. It needs the following two episodes to be ""complete"". Enjoy the film if you don't mind an irritating Gungan.
(P.S. Make sure you get the Widescreen Verion an not the fullscreen. The Same applies for episode 2)",1037318400,,1704,4.220858895705521
659223,3,6303454038,"I have been a fan of George Lucas and Star Wars Episodes 4-6.
The production quality is fantastic as expected but the story did leave me disappointed.  It looked like they were trying for special effects more than character development, so lacked much of the charm and humanity that I came to enjoy in the ""original"" episodes.
(I would have been happy if they cut some time out of that way-too-long pod race scene and had the characters talk to each other more.  If you check out the supplementary material, you see that there was even MORE of the pod race that had been cut out!)",1037232000,2,580,4.462264150943396
659224,4,6303454038,"Okay, it's true.  I do believe that Lucas has lost a bit of his edge, but you can see that even in Return of the Jedi.  Really I would normally have given this movie three stars, but in this case this movie is tied into a wonderful series, so though it wouldn't hold up alone being part of the series brings it up.
Yes, Jar Jar is annoying.  No this movie doesn't have the darker edge that made the original Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back so good.  The major fault with this story, though, is that the characters aren't as enduring.  There is no character as edgy as Han Solo.  Anakin is cute, but you never doubt that he will pull off what needs to be done like you may have sometimes doubted the whiney Luke.  Amadala does a good job, but doesn't have the snap back fiery wit of Leia, or her love-hate relationship like Leia did with Han.  R2D2 is great and shows his heroic side, but we only got a short taste of the interplay between the heroic R2D2 and his cowardly counterpart C3PO.
So, obviously the movie has its faults, but it does succeed where it is important.  In the end it is a thoroughly entertaining space opera.  Isn't that what Lucas's goal was originally when making Star Wars?  Perhaps this movie alone is no classic, but it is part of a series that is.",1036972800,,1276,4.275

Part II has better action, more impressive special effects and hardly any Jar Jar! But TPM does have some good points that make it an enjoyable entry into the franchise.
Pod races, spectacular CGI, lightsaber battles and outer space battles all combine to create a sense of fun in the biggest form. The FX throughout the film is impressive, with CG characters interacting with their human counterparts. John Williams' score for the film is brilliant, evoking the themes of the charcters and action with a bold, operatic approach which is familiar but welcome. George Lucas' visionary approach to the film creates a world rich in diversity and fascinating creatures.
The action is the film's strong point, and this one has enough fun action set pieces to compensate for the lack of good characters and the slow pacing. Liam Neeson is good as Qui- Gon Jinn, Obi Wan Kenobi's master, and Darth Maul is great as Sith Lord Darth Maul, despite his rather short screen time. But McGregor's Obi Wan is a mere cipher and most of the characters aren't that good in comparison to the well-written heroes and villians in A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. And then there's Jar Jar. While he's actually not as bad as most critics think, he's not one of the most likable characters in the saga.
But all that is missing the point completly. STAR WARS isn't about acting, it's about the good old-fashioned story of good vs. evil, all done in spectacular fashion with lightsaber fights. And while it's below par compared to ATTACK OF THE CLONES, it's nontheless a fun, action-filled entry into one of the most well-loved film franchises of all time.
The DVD's extra features are impressive, with a commentary from Lucas and the special effects team, an extensive 'making of' documentary, deleted scenes, trailers and much, much more. The digital transfer is first-rate and the animated interactive menus are really imaginative.

Darth Maul (not scary) wants to eliminate the child for he is the chosen one. What a bunch of bull. Jar Jar Binks is the absolute worst thing ever created. Natalie Portman needs to stick to making movies like ""The Professional"" which is a way better movie than this. This movie is meaningless and has no heart as in the other three. Shame on anybody who likes this.",1034899200,7,693,4.507936507936508
659292,3,6303454038,"The first three Star Wars movies are legendary.  They are timeless classics that have a cult following.  That brings us to the fourth episode in the series Phantom Menace.  This was a very well done movie with a great story of how Anakin Skywalker and OB Won Kanobi first meet.  The special effects were wonderful, Even Jar Jar Binks.  I may be in the minority but I felt Jar Jar actually added to the movie.  Just as in all stories the beginning is the slowest, it is where characters need to be developed so the story is usually slow.  It is an important part of the story but the movie just doesn't reach that legendary level of the previous three.  On the DVD the extras are worth the purchase.  There is a sit down interview with George Lucas which is very rare since he does not do a lot of interviews and he gives you a behind the scenes look at how they made the movie.  I still recomend this for anyone who likes the Star Wars movies or is a sci-fi fan.",1034121600,,962,4.2076502732240435
659293,2,6303454038,"It's interesting. Star Wars, a series that Mark Hamill's acting couldn't kill, was laid low by it's own creator. The Phantom Menace took a formerly great series and disolved it into a stream of slapstick, pod racing, and Jar-Jar Binks. Some thoughts: why are the battle robots given weapons that are seperate from themselves? Why aren't the built into the hardware? Also, why do these death robots use normal speach to talk to each other, and why do they look like people instead of a form that kills more efficently?
However, it does warrant a second star. Why? For one part: the Duel of the Fates, a John Williams-underscored fight sequence on par with the better moments of Star Wars. If the rest of the film had been on that level, The Phantom Menace might have been the best of the series. Instead, it is regared, by and large, as the worst.",1034035200,4,846,4.572368421052632
659294,4,6303454038,"I'm finding the scathing reviews of this film laughable.  I mean what did you people think?  Anyone who can't see that there was absolutely no way Lucas could have even come close to living up the expectations of this movie - is naive to say the least.  Sure the movie has flaws and could have been better, but not a whole lot better.
Phantom Menace has three main flaws:
1. The ending space battle against the ""control"" ship featured no attack plan, but rather Anakin just bumbling around up there in space accidentally blowing the ship up.  This creates a serious credibility problem, but more importantly doesn't give the audience any guidance as to what to be routing for, and then what to cheer for when it's achieved.
2. The ground battle was too cartoonish, and needed to be more violent...But worst of all was Jar Jar's bumbling around clumsily while participating in the battle.  Come on - Jar Jar a General?...P>3. The Vice Roy (spelling?) of the Trade Federation didn't come off as genuinely evil in their demeanor.  Their speaking accents were dorky, clumsy and too light mannered.  They just didn't give off a convincing ""evil"" vibe.  On top of this, all the ""suffering of the people"" of Naboo caused by the Trade Federation and its army was never shown - only spoke of.  This only further lessened the ""evil"" creadibility of the Trade Federation.
Had these problems been anticipated and fixed, this film would have been much more convincing, but still wouldn't have lived up the expectations.
And those that criticize the acting in PM - come on.  The acting in the first trilogy is even worse in some ways (exceptions are Alec Guiness, Peter Cushing, James Earl Jones, Ian McDiarmid, and Frank Oz).
I wonder if the ""Star Wars Generation"" (which I am a member of) is more critical of this film because they are no longer kids, and are much more sensative to the flaws in a movie's acting, plot or action sequences?  I tend to think so.",1033603200,2,1948,4.666666666666667

It is merely an introduction, and at the time, critics and fans alike were dissaponted because nothing was new.",1033084800,,399,4.555555555555555

Okay, about the only person that didn't know that topping the original trilogy was an impossible task was Lucas himself but even saying that, what were his remaining options? There was a story to be told here. No one is under any illusions that Episode One's archilles heel was the storyline. Cramming so much past historical history into one film must have seemed as daunting a task to Lucas as Skywalker attempting to lift the X wing from the Dagobah swamp. So what of the pacing? Unfortunately, both are one and the same. If a story is disjointed, then the pacing and structure must also suffer as a result. Performances? No actor is reluctant to stress that when starring in a Star Wars film, you learn a type of Jedi frown, and that's about it (though singular and pleasantly surprising praise must be handed to an electric Ewan McGregor who's devotion to lightsabering is an exercise in unrestraint). Last saving grace? Action, special effects and set pieces, and it's here The Phantom Menace truly delivers. The velocity of the Tatooine pod race has never been seen in the history of cinema, bar none. The opening sequence sets the tone (let no one tell you that when they saw those two twin saber beams appear in the mist on the Droid Control Ship, that wasn't the true spirit of Star Wars) and the climatic three way lightsaber battle wraps up the first prequel in spectacular fashion. All in all, a flawed but highly entertaining chapter that is no where near as good as it should have been and no where near as bad as people will lead you to believe. Go on, go back and replay chapter 41 to close and tell me that single shot of the containment beams opening, allowing Kenobi and Maul to swedge for each other for all they're worth isn't simply magical...",1032825600,,2195,4.573604060913706

This DVD is excellent in that it is a two disc set with the movie seperating it from the extras which is what DVDs currently do. The extra scenes in the movie are magnificent in the quality that they were done. The usual theatrical trailers and the behind the scenes movies were good.

659387,3,6303454038,"When George Lucas decided to make the first prequel to the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, devotees of the saga waited years with much anticipation for its release. When the time finally arrived, massive crowds gathered outside theatres, some waiting in protracted lines for days in advance, ready to once again enter that ""galaxy far, far away"" as soon as the doors opened. However, ""Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" left many die-hards of Lucas' space opera unsatisfied and disappointed. Not because it is a bad film, but because it lacks most of the elements which made the original trilogy the superb classic it is.
Set decades before the unforgettable Blockade Runner star-fight scene which kicked off the series in ""Episode IV - A New Hope"", ""The Phantom Menace"" finds a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his mentor, Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), sent as diplomats to settle a trade dispute between the Galactic Trade Federation and the planet Naboo. Before the negotiations even begin, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon must brandish their lightsabers to battle droids, as the Galactic Trade Federation - used as puppets by Darth Sidious for a more sinister agenda - launches an invasion of Naboo. After the planet is seized by an army of Battle Droids, the two Jedi must rescue Naboo's adolescent queen - and future mother of Luke Skywalker - Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), and escort her through a conflict-ridden journey to the Galactic Republic capitol, the planet Coruscant. Along the way, they are accompanied by the boy who's fate we all know, Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a loquacious - and annoying - Gungan, Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), and those two lovable droids, C-3PO and R2-D2 (Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker).
There is plenty to enjoy in the first installment of the ""Star Wars"" prequels, like the exciting and fast-paced pod race sequence, action-packed star-fights, John Williams' impeccable - as always - score (one of his best!), and a spectacular, creatively-choreographed lightsaber battle between Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn, and the Sith, Darth Maul. Unfortunately, the film seems homogenized, foisting special effects and laser battles in lieu of heart and imagination. The story is not engaging. Because you already know the fates of most of the characters, it seems somewhat pointless and redundant - ostensibly, George Lucas had dollar signs on his mind instead of devoted fans of the saga while writing the screenplay. The characters, although likeable, lack depth and dimensionality; the performances are adequate but never exhibited spirit and empathy. The dialogue is clichd and banal. Lastly, the visual effects (courtesy of Industrial Light and Magic) are as impressive as ever, but the starships and vehicles do not meet the stunning originality of the designs seen in episodes IV through VI.
There is a lack of cohesion between ""The Phantom Menace"" and the original trilogy. Although part of the same body of work, they feel somehow disjointed. Perhaps the prequel is best viewed as a separate entity, not existing in the same world with the saga that began ""A long time ago"". George Lucas' vision is not how I wanted the ""Star Wars"" saga to begin.",1032220800,,3197,5.103053435114504
659388,5,6303454038,"Star Wars episode 1 is in my oppinion extremely underrated.  I think that this one is better than episode 4 because well, the new trilogy isn't all about action, there is more romance, drama, and the story is much better than atleast ep. 4.  Infact this was my favorite SW movie(aside from Jedi)because this has much more chracters and plot than the first one.  The story revolves around the start of the intergalactic war when Naboo gets invaded.  When the Jedis Obi Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jin go in to settle the conflict it nearly starts war.  After that fails they go to Naboo where battles are raging, there they meet Gungan Jar Jar binks.  From there the movie starts getting better and beter.  This movie tells about the characters of the original and how they got to what they are now.  Now you know how Anakin got to the darkside.  The originals actually make alot more sense.  i am not saying that I don't like the originals(Return of the Jedi was my favorite movie of all time actually.  The special effects are mezmorizing and just add to the fun of this amazing series.  I dissagree harshley with most of the other posters.

Now, three years after it's cinematic release I can't help but feel disappointed. As beautiful as it looks, Episode 1 is mercilessly let down by it's story and some of the main characters, like Jar Jar Binks and Anakin Skywalker, get on your nerves from the word go.
Yes, it looks good. But apart from it's gorgeous detailed landscape views and the spectacular showdown with Darth Maul at the end of the movie there's simply nothing much that will make you want to come back to this movie.

And while if it stood alone, it wouldn't have caused the kind of following, love and devotion the originals did, it was still a fine movie with a lot to recommend it. Star Wars: A New Hope was the meat of its trilogy. Lucas didn't know if he would ever be making sequels to it, therefore it contains all the emotional punch it needs to stand alone. The Phantom Menace was never intended to stand alone, and Attack of the Clones was so good I forgive PM for some of it's lacks in light of viewing it as The Introduction. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Except. For. That. Horrible. Kid. Of all the incredible young actors out there, and all the thousands of kids they auditioned, how could they have made such a terrible mistake? Or at the least, once they got started, how could George not have seen how stilted and awful Jake Lloyd was and recast the part? In my opinion he could have saved the movie in one fell swoop by doing so. I have to watch it despite Jake Lloyd's performance. As much time and money as Lucas spent revamping the original trilogy with new CG effects, I'm hoping at some point down the line he'll reshoot Anakin's role in The Phantom Menace with a different actor and use his digital wizardry to edit it in. Then you could get absorbed into the movie without being jolted back to reality every time Anakin walks onscreen. Then, it would truly be a Great Movie.",1030060800,,1446,4.399253731343284

There are several weak story points (I won't spoil it in case you haven't yet seen the film) that take away from the movie. Plus George seems to have been more in love with the CGI characters than he was in the story.
For a true story, I think that it is lacking. But I will definitely concede the point that Phantom Menace gets you hyped up for the others. I've had hours of conversations on what can and should happen next, plus what is the best way to pull it off. And I expect to have many more hours.

Star Wars is more like a feeling, a cult movement, instead of the actual content of the movie itself. It's almost a spiritual feeling...so embraced that it allows oneself to(or try really hard to) ignore the bad acting and silly one liners. I suppose that is because of the story and what the story represents(you know...the battle between good and evil or maybe it's because it's childish and most of us were kids when we seen it for the first time). However, I do NOT understand why George had to pick 2 terrible actors to portray Anakin(both the actors in episodes 1 and 2). Perhaps the part is so original that it's too difficult for basic acting? Nonetheless, I still love the movies, but I can't help wanting to smack the 2 actors that play Anakin Skywalker. It's really George's fault. He should have said, ""Get someone in here that can act!"" and then told the cute little kid to go home. It couldn't have been a budget issue, do you think?
Star Wars is a comical sci-fi that wants to be taken seriously. No problem there George. Just do a better job on the casting for the 3rd and final episode...PLEASE?

The story too simple to be enjoyable and the one character that drove me crazy was Jar Jar Binks. I couldn't understand him and ended up hating him. The stand out performance for me was Liam Nielson and Ewan McGregor. The kid and Jar Jar could disappear and the movie might have improved. Natalie Portman was honest and simple but very convincing as the diplomatic ruler of the now failing senate.
That was the theatrical release for me - now the DVD release is much different. This multi-million dollar production works much better for me on the small screen. I can hear everything and skip past jar Jar when I want to. The visual effects and the technical aspects of the film are amazing.

Evrything i loved about the originals, i even loved Revenge of the Jedi, is gone.
The little kid is almost as obnoxios as Jar Jar, luckily for him we got distracted by covering our ears in horror whenever Jar Jar was on screen.
But my nephew at 4 loved this film, kids seem to love it, anyone with slightly more demanding an appetite tends to feel naseus.
This was blatantly concevied as a giant marketing excercise, to see how many games and toys they could tie in to one big product.
The fact Ewan Mcgreggor, in interviews said it was the most boring thing hes ever done pretty much sums it up.
If only Lucus would forget about making millions from games and marketing and remeber that its a film we were all waiting a long time to enjoy.",1029110400,3,843,4.3081761006289305

I thought Phantom Menace was OK when I saw it in the theatre - looked and sounded great but it was less than met the eye. This was what I expected since I've never gotten excited about the old trilogy - sorry Star Wars fans! I was not upset about it since I had no emotional investment in the original, I just thought this movie was better than the old ones because it looked and sounded better.
After a long weekend of viewing the hours of incredible extras on this DVD I became a George Lucas fan. When I watched Phantom Menace again, it was with different eyes. It still has the same oft-mentioned shortcomings, but knowing the intention of the creator I'm now able to watch it in a different way than I do other movies. And as a creative artist and performer I was awestruck by the extraordinary quality of work done on every aspect of it by a huge array of exceptional people in every creative category.
No, characterization, dialogue and a conventional plot are not George's forte - nor is that really what he's after. If you watch Phantom Menace knowing his vision it becomes a different film.",1028851200,2,1170,4.416666666666667

In many ways the DVD is better than the film. Don't get me wrong, I liked more about the film than I disliked but, the DVD is an excellent transfer with nice extras. There are a few hidden ""easter eggs"" which show outtakes and some humorous additions. If you even faintly enjoyed this film then you'll be pleased with the DVD. Of course, we're all waiting for the original three films to get the DVD treatment. One of the beauties about DVD is the ability to freeze the action and clearly see what's in the picture. You may want to do that in a few scenes here. In the Senate scenes you can use the still action to check out some of the characters slipped in here...like the ""E.T.'s"" etc,. I personally like to skip to the Darth Maul scenes. Great stuff. For all of it's faults, I still enjoyed the movie. I think we tend to be a bit harsh on the newer films because of the comparisons to the original trilogy. Again, the digital transfer is top notch as is the sound quality.

Was it the special effects or the actors that you wanted to see?  We as humans are beginning to look more at special effects than actors that have acting ability.

However, I do believe that George Lucas has essentially lost his mystical touch.  You just cannot recapture the magic of the originals.  Although it should be noted that I have never been a huge Star Wars fan.  My husband is and even he was a little disappointed.  He and all the other die-hards hated Jar Jar Binks.  I, personally, found him to be great comic relief and a cleverly done character.  But it was Liam Neeson who was definitely the stand-out of the film.  I thoroughly enjoyed his performance.  As for the others ... typical Star Wars fare I suppose.  The fanfare over Darth Maul, however, was completely unjustified as he has a very small part in this movie.  This movie is worth seeing and if you're a die-hard trilogy fan, definitely worth owning simply because it's against the code of the Star Wars buffs not to.

The movie is just ok, George Lucas seems to be a little bit rusty after a long hiatus of adding to the Star Wars universe.  This is the first Star Wars movie, and introduces many of the character that millions have come to know and love such as C3-PO and R2-D2.
The film follows the early childhood of Anakin Skywalker, the soon to be Darth Vader that we see in the original three films.  The story moves along at a medium pace and includes all the usually Lucas fanfare of special effects and aliens.  The pod racing scene is especially memorable.
For anyone that liked the original Star Wars films than this movie will be enjoyable.  It's key in understanding much of the Star Wars universe.  A good film to say the least!",1026950400,3,849,4.248447204968944

I've grown to like this film a lot, because it's an introduction, and even though Jar Jar Binks as annoying as he is isn't as bad as you think, the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi were worse!  The point of this story is to focus on the trade federation dispute and Anakin's training beginning after he's freed as a slave.  I think many people expected it to start off like that and were disappointed because it didn't have much of a story. Star Wars ep. 4 didn't have much of a story either, it was an introduction to the characters and this is what ep .1 is!  Ep. 2 is better than this only because the REAL story starts with that film as ""The Empire Strikes Back"" went into detail with Luke Skywalker, so in other words STOP bashing the film!

659650,3,6303454038,"Star Wars Episode 1 was easily the most anticipated movie of the 90s.  However after waiting in line for 2 hours and finaly seeing the movie I was less then pleased with the movie.
First of all, the movie was way too commercialized.  George Lucas threw everything he could into the merchandise industry from pop can labels to inflatable Darth Maul chairs.  It really took the taste out of anyone's mouth.
Seccond was the plot:  Does anyone know what the plot was?  I couldn't.  I couldn't tell what the deal was with the Trade Federation and their dumb treaties.  And why Naboo?  Why some backwater boonies that no one cares about?  My point is the movie had NO plot, and if it did George Lucas did a poor job of showing it.
Third was the concentration on special effects:  George Lucas spent too much manpower and money on the special effects.  I give this movie two stars for the special effects.  In the first Star Wars, they concentrated on BOTH the special effects and the script and it became the most grossed in movie of all time. (after inflation rates of course)  The biggest example was the podrace, gosh what a boring scene!  It kept going on and on.
Fourth was the bad linking the other Star Wars movies:  Anyone who has watched the original Star Wars as much as me can easily see many things that don't add up.  Such as in Return of the Jedi, Obi tells Luke that when he met his father, he was already ""a great pilot"" but in Episode 1 he was just a little kid.  Then there's my favorite point that Obi says in the Empire Strikes Back that Yoda was the ""Jedi master who instructed me"" but in Episode 1 it was Liam Neeson who trained him.
5th is the bad script, characters and acting:  Can anyone honestly say that they wanted to see Jar Jar die?  I was hoping that Chewbacca would eat him in episode II.  His voice was annoying and I could hardly understand a thing he said.  Then there was Annakin, granted young kid actors arn't the best in the world however why did they pick THAT kid?  ""Are you an angel?"" ""Then they blow you up!""  Come on!  Not only were those...lines but his acting was aweful.  George Lucas should've picked someone like Haley Joel or someone who can read from a script without looking at it.  Next we see Darth Maul.  He had a lot of potential as a villian, he was dark, calm and had one heck of a weapon (double edge lightsaber) however George Lucas decided to spend more time on the pod race then concentrating on character development.  Most of the script contained ...lines that would put the original Resident Evil game to shame...  I nearly[became ill]during the pod race.
The only reason why I gave this another star was because of the last Jedi vs. Sith fighting sequence.  It was well done however it does not make a movie.  Fighting sequences only make movies in the South Pacific.
Overall this was a big disapointment and will reflect on George Lucas for years to come.",1026777600,2,2917,4.426691729323308

From the special effects, the acting and the directing, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is without a doubt one of my all time favorites. I loved the fact that Liam Neeson was in this. (He actually gives a superb performance as Obi Wan Kenobi's [Ewan McGregor] master). But like I said, I'm not a fan of the originals. If I was then I would probably dislike this as well. But the new generation accepts this and loves it! The DVD Transfer is beyond superb (one of the best DVD's out to date).

So why did a movie that went on to gross an unprecedented 430 million dollars get such negative press?  Who knows?

I realize that some of this was because of the wider appeal that Lucas was trying to get, but Jar Jar Binks was just annoying.  As a matter of fact, the whole Gungan race was a little annoying, although I can see how they fit into the story.  There were several times in the movie that I thought were a little hokey and slapstick for the rest of the movie, but I let these things slide.  Obviously, the special effects were top notch.  I kind of assumed they would be going in, so I wasn't really surprised by that.  I was impressed by the detail in the pod race and the battles.  I knew I wanted the DVD to add to my collection, even if it only included a nice digital master of the movie with some director commentary and cast and crew profiles, but extremely pleased when I discovered the wealth of extras included.  Apparently, Lucas is a bit of a perfectionist, because he wasn't satisfied with the normal deleted scenes method of simply shoving them in as is.  There are seven fully restored scenes including a much lengthier pod race scene.  You can't even tell these were removed before final production, they are up to the same level of quality as the film itself.  On top of that, there are all the featurettes, too many to count.

This movie takes place 30 years before the original Star Wars.  The Federation has placed a blockade around the planet of Naboo.  Two Jedi knights, played by Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, are sent to negotiate a peace betwen the Naboo and the Federation, but instead the Federation tries to kill the Jedi.  The Jedi, along with Queen Amidala and Jar Jar Binks are able to escape.  However, their ship develops problems with its hyperdrive, and they are forced to land on the planet of Tattooine.  It is here that Qui-Gon Jin, played by Neeson, discovers Anikin Skywalker.  Qui-Gon is convinced that this young boy has the power to become a Jedi.  However, they cannot leave Tattooine until their ship is repaired.  Anikin enters the pod races to try to win a bet Qui-Gon placed with Waddo, a trader who happens to have a hyperdrive.  Anikin wins the race and Waddo somewhat reluctantly releases Anikin from his slavery to the custody of Qui-gon.  With their ship now repaired, the group heads to Courissant, a planet-sized city.  Here, Queen Amidala pleads her case to the Senate.  Also unknown to the Jedi, A Sith, Darth Maul, has followed them as well.  The two Jedi eventually meet Maul in a fierce battle. In the climactic ending battle, the Naboo and Gungans join forces to repel the federation attack.

659756,2,6303454038,"Back when ""Star Wars"" first came out (before we started adding numbers and additional titles to the films) I was entranced.  Here was something that had not been made in years -- a bigger-than-life Saturday matinee action hero film with good guys and bad guys.  Oh, on top of that it had truly amazing special effects.  The acting was not the greatest and some of the lines truly hackneyed, but other acting made up for it and the plot was whopping great fun.
Fast forward to The Star Was Phenomenon.
I went to see this movie (Star Wars 1:  The Phantom Menace) twice on the big screen.  I only intended to go once, but I didn't have the heart to tell a friend I had already seen it because he was so excited.  Much like the original, there are some truly amazing special effects.  There are also a lot of things that go ""BOOM"".  The fight scenes with the jedi look magnificent, although I can see why Liam Neeson has said he will never act in front of a blue screen again.
Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor -- I've seen all three in other films, all of them showing (particularly Neeson) that they can truly act.  Unfortunately they have been handed a script that would have been considered childish in comparison to the original if the two had been released at the same time.
The film looks pretty (well, okay, the scruffy parts look scruffy -- in other words it seems to look right).  There are LOTS of whiz-bang special effects.  There is the return of R2D2 (who even gets his own profile close-up) and C3PO (sans skin).  Did I mention there are special effects?  Lots of aliens are shown, even ET as a senator.  Oh, and there are special effects.
There is no good acting.  There is a horrible plot.  There is Jar-jar Binks, who subtracts 2 stars from any film aimed at anyone above the ""we like Telitubbies"" level.  There are so many special effects that they become glaringly obvious and detract from any semblance of plot or acting.  Natalie Portman sounds like she is doing a cold read of her lines and Liam, O! Liam!, most of the time looks disgusted to be in front of the camera.
Yet another deathstar is destoryed, this time totally on accident.  Yet another far-too-cute character is introduced (please, wipe him out before the next film!).  And overall the original tale is not advanced one jot or tiddle.
George Lucas has shown supreme contempt for all reviewers.  That is fine, he is allowed to.  He has also shown extreme contempt for his fan base.  Did this film add significantly to the Star Wars canon?  No.  Did it detract from it?  Yes.
So why have faith in him for any future films?",1025481600,4,2613,4.494692144373673

Why would Lucas continually bring up trivial information in every film when it has already been stated in the first film and should be remembered by every fan of this movie.

I think this trilogy is less about the characters and more about the world that they live in, and thus the movies focus on that. Also, it's about an 8 year old boy - so it's written that way. It's not nessisarily an adult movie. And when I look at these facts, it becomes a better one for me. I was vaguely dissapointed that there wern't more cool features that came with the DVD, but just getting it was enough for me.

I'm not saying this is the best movie I've ever seen - far from it, but I did feel it was a great film, remaining loyal to the Star Wars ethos, and leading old fans and new alike deep into a story, which (espeically after seeing Episode II), is deep and compelling.
One thing the die-hard fans of the original are forgetting is that George Lucas's main objective was to lure a new generation of fans with his breathtaking battles, gobsmacking visals and incomphrehensively impressive lightsabre duels (I don't care who you are, you have to admit the final battle was SPECTACULAR).
The plot was involving enough, and the acting was of a reasonably good quality. OK, it could have (and, in some people's opinions, should have) been better, but it's good in itself. And maybe that's what people should remember.",1025049600,2,838,4.7465753424657535

You see the reason that everyone thinks episode 1 is stupid is that Luke Skywalker doesn't prance onscreen. Every one is used to this whiny personality that he had. I appreciate Mr. Lucas for not including his personality in any of these characters.
Of course, no movie is perfect. There are flaws. Like why does this movie seem to last 1 hour instead of the Star Wars classic length 2 hours? Why does Maul only have 2-5 lines in the movie?

659802,5,6303454038,"I had never been a fan of Star Wars before this movie-I was a kid then, sure that the Science Fiction of Star Wars was a bunch of confusing mumbo jumbo, weird, dumb, boring. We had watched one in 3rd grade, I didn't even watch it at all.
But you know, I'd had never cared enough to see them. Never even given it a chance.
I was in 6th grade-I believe. It was in a Time for Kids magazine. An article about this movie-me first thinking ""oh, stupid old Star Wars"" absent mindedly. But, that afternoon, I was stuck in the car with my older sister, (an 8th grader at the time) wiht only this magazine to entertain us.
As we looked through the two pages dedicated to this movie, we became a little interested-""This doesn't look so bad"" we were thinking. I remember Queen Amidala's headdress catching my eye. ""Who is this?"" I wondered. It seemed very interesting.
As we informed my dad how this movie didn't look so horribly unbearable, He told us ""Yeah, Star Wars. The originals are very good. I've tried to tell you before. Sure, we can go and see it.""
I remember the night we had planned-my dad was getting home late from a job he had to do-and I was actually nervous. What if he didn't get home in time for us to see this movie? I had a feeling inside-a feeling that somehow, this was going to be a movie I would really enjoy.
He turned up a little late, and we arrived in the theater as the ""STAR WARS, EPISODE I THE PHANTOM MENACE"" Writing screen was scrolling. I sat down, a little more excited than I thought I would EVER be about 'stupid old Star Wars'.
It really saddens me-honestly, makes me very very sad-how badly this movie is ripped apart. As I left the movie theater, I was enthralled, entranced-and most of all, totally SURPRISED. Star Wars wasn't dumb, old, or stupud. It was AWESOME, AMAZING, IMAGINATIVE-and more than I ever thought it would EVER be.
I watched the other Three later the same week-and loved them, finding my favourite character, Leia, and just loving these movies even more.
Jar Jar Binks is a fresh, halarious, comic relief character-he had me laughing so many times, and made me really love him fro all his thousand faults. Star Wars is made with love and effort, by a man who has a vivid imagination and a love for what he does. Jar Jar was meant ot be a lovebale, funny, great chracacter-and that is exactly what I think of him as.
The actors portrayed roles not easily filled with perfection and an amazing quality that kept me in this movie.
I love it-I will love it forever. Star Wars will always be special to me-it showed me a new world and a new way to look at everything. It has charm, humor, wit, heart and of course, The Force. And I don't mind at all if I am pelted with  Unhelpful votes.
Star Wars will always be...Star Wars, to me.

How could Lucas have gone so badly wrong?  No director in his right mind would attempt to interleave multiple unrelated action scenes:  meanwhile back at the ranch, back to the other ranch, back to another ranch, back to the first ranch, etc., and hope that any of them would have dramatic impact. The scenes with Anakin's mother were painfully poorly edited; you or anyone else could do better.  They were pathetic examples of the film-makers art.
This pathetic excuse for a movie seems to me to be a product of putting the cart before the horse. Instead of special effects supporting a story line about people and their interactions, human actors instead fill in the blanks between special effects.  The result was uninteresting, threadbare and worst of all, childish and amateurish. Human actors were an inconvenient component in a super-animation movie.  If technology could have allowed Lucas to replace them altogether with computer generated imagery, he would have dispensed with them entirely. The film is a Saturday morning cartoon.

Overall, the acting was OK, with, in my opinion, the best acting being done by Ewan Mcgregor as Obi-Wan.  I'm not even going to start to criticize Jake Lloyd's performance as Anakin ""Annie"" Skywalker, because everybody has already criticized it enough.  I know that all of these actors are very good ones (I just saw Episode II, Natalie Portman was awesome in that movie, and has improved vastly from Episode 1, as was the Anakin Skywalker character played by Hayden Christensen, and Ewan Mcgregor has improved even more from his great performance in Episode 1).  The comedy that was attempted NEVER even started to be funny in the minds of adults or teens, as Jar Jar Binks wasn't funny at all.  The only good parts were the Darth Maul fight, since I am a fan of Lightsaber combat, and the Yoda parts, since I am a fan of Yoda.
I'm sorry to criticize so much, I've never liked critics who overly criticize things, because frankly, they couldn't do ANY better.  Neither could I.  But as a Star Wars fan, I was disappointed.

659860,1,6303454038,"The Phantom Menace is indeed a cinematic achievement. What other movie can you think of that can make accomplished actors like Liam Neeson, Ewan MacGregor, Natalie Portman, and Samuel L. Jackson appear to be abysmal? What other film (or trilogy) can you name that borrows so heavily from other sources (2001, Star Trek, Tolkien, Wagner, Kurosawa, Ben Hur) and has its creator still brazenly defending its originality? What other picture has been so overly hyped for its supposedly staggering special effects and yet those same effects are cartoonish and blatantly unrealistic?
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the previous 3 movies (as a child). And, for all of its delusions of grandeur, Phantom does work very well as a children's movie. The characters are amazingly two-dimensional, and the one seemingly ambiguous character is obviously the evil emperor of the previous movies. There's a Satan/Frankenstein hybrid named Darth something-or-other who tries to fill the Vader void, but hopelessly fails. Maybe he needed to have that Nazi helmet thing going..
The Thing-Fish character, Jar-Jar Binks is (as everyone knows) so annoying that I'm not going to waste my time or yours by going into it. The young man who played Anakin really needed some instruction. Considering that there were so many capable adults involved with this thing that were awful, it's silly and needlessly cruel to criticize Jake Lloyd's callow performance. Hell, Haley Joel Osment would have stalled with such poor direction.
I recently rented this leviathan the other night, just to see if it really is as bad as I remember it. Indeed, it's worse. Even John Williams' score lacks the Wagnerian passion of the previous movies. Personally, I don't believe the original Star Wars movies are THAT good (Empire is by far the best of the 3), but at least they're good fun. 2001 is, for me, immaculate science fiction. As remarked upon by many people, Phantom is truly a movie for children. I'm prepared for the zillion ""not-helpful"" votes that will rake against me, but many of the hard-core fans of these movies display a very childish devotion to this cinematic franchise. Whereas once children strove to emulate adults, these puerile people are adults who desire to be children.
However, judging the Phantom Menace by these standards isn't entirely fair. By far the most important legacy of these Star Wars movies is the marketing ploys and techniques that has made the SW movies the biggest things since sliced bread. With the Obi-Wan bathrobes, Darth Vader toy lightsabers, Wookie spaying kit, Luke undergarments, Jar-Jar Binks greatest reggae hits CDs, Han Solo's 12-Step Book on Isolation Therapy, Slave Leia pinups, etc etc, as well as around 2 thousand different versions of these films on video, the Star Wars creator's true talent is for milking the drone-like adherents of his intergalactic Empire.

2. The dialouge isn't that great but it's not fantastic in any of the Star Wars films
3. It's a get to know the charecters film.  Plus Lucas is trying to draw in a whole new generation.
4.  Yes Jar-Jar does get annoying but for those of you that have seen Episode II you now know why he was created.

Liam Neeson is *outstanding* as a rebel Jedi. Period. Great casting choice. Ewan McGregor gives us a pretty good look at an apprentice Obi-Wan. But the story is what drives this series and George Lucas certainly has a great story. I reduce it to 4 stars but not because of Jar-Jar Binks - who actually gave more life to this film than he gets credit. You're *supposed* to be slightly annoyed with him the same way C3PO tends to drive you crazy. That's the point. He has some really funny lines and the comic relief does it's job.
I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the incomplete information about the Jedi universe and their history. Not until Attack of the Clones do we really see enough of this. The Jedi Council was repeated all too often with not enough forward movement. There's no hint of ""Count Dooku"" or whatever his Jedi name is which seems to be a huge plot point in Clones. Oh well, they still set up Obi-Wan and Anakin very well and the Sith is explained appropriately. Mitichlorions (sp?) are pretty well explained as the basis of the Force.
The politics are OK which is, after all, the entire reason for the conflict along with the religious implications of Good v. Evil.
I'm amazed with Ian McDiarmid the actor being able to reprise his prequel role as Senator Palpatine with the full expectation of where his character is going.
The score is superb as usual because Star Wars is as much John Williams (to a point) as George Lucas.
I've only seen Clones twice and I don't understand why people are trashing Phantom Menace so much. It has *MUCH* better acting than Clones and thousand times better dialogue. If you are objective, you can't honestly say that Clones is a better story, either. Of course, any movie with Christopher Lee as a villain is OK in my book but, please, did they have to duplicate the scene between Saruman and Gandalf almost verbatim?? It's a good continuation of Phantom Menace but much stiffer and with a totally corny romance to boot. Where's a young Harrison Ford when you need him?
This is supposed to be about Phantom Menace but you can't help to mingle the other films when reviewing.
My final criticism: George Lucas is a great story conceiver but  he needs to hand over directing and partial screen-writing to someone else for Episode III like he did with V and VI.

But at least it's about good guys and bad guys, and the grey, middle turf that lies in between which is what everyday life is, unlike all too many movies these days. The whole vague ""Force"" thing is and always has been kind of strange, but I'll forgive George Lucas' philosophical and theological shortcomings because I ate alot of popcorn when I saw it on the large screen originally and was rooting for the good guys, since they always win in the end. I mean, Obi-Wan slew the diabolical-looking Lord Maul by slicing him in two with the light-saber. . .the good guys always win.

659887,5,6303454038,"The Phantom Menace.  Was it really that bad?  Many of the people who have seen this film do not give it credit where credit is due.  In this writer's case, I thought it to be just as good as the original trilogy.  Now, before all of you disbelievers groan and stop reading, here's why.  The reasoning behind many of TPM's criticism lies in it's target demographic.  Some people thought it was just too ""kiddy"".  Well, in a way it was.  It was made in a way to reflect the times of prosperity, and to reflect the age of Anakin.  For all of you who have seen AOTC (are there any who haven't?), you know that it much, much darker and more mature.  Why?  Because Anakin is older, and more mature.  During war, happiness is almost non-exsistent, as displayed by Episode II.  In Episode I, the Republic is prospering as it never has before.  Therefore, times are happy and enjoyed by all creating the so-called ""kiddiness"" (if that's a word).  The plot was superb, the acting was excellent, and the action scenes were some of the best of the five movies.  Out of 10, I give it a 9.9.  The only reason I took 0.1 off, was the scene where Anakin flies the starfighter.  That was rather hokey, but it makes sense since he is so strong in the force and is, don't forget, the chosen one.  If you Anti-Phantoms out there still aren't satisfied (which you ""people"" probably are not), the Phantom Menace is A TON better once you see AOTC.  It explains and fufills the things that the monsters that didn't like TPM didn't like, for example, Jar-Jar.  Ah, Jar-Jar.  Many see him as the annoying one.  He was annoying.  But he was meant to be.  It has a reason and a purpose.  It shows his intelligence is not very high.  This plays prominantly in the Star Wars Saga, as you can see in AOTC, Jar-Jar's gullibility and stupidity convince him to start a vote giving Chancellor Palpatine emergency powers, starting his gradual transformation to the emporer.  So, in a way, it is because of Jar-Jar that the galaxy has to face the tyranny of the Empire.  As I come to a close, you can send me hateful e-mails, you can look down on me, and insult my level of maturity, I won't care.  I thought The Phantome Menace had the original flair the the original trilogy had and even pushed the envelope in places the Original Trilogy hadn't yet touched.

659888,4,6303454038,"Many critics who slammed this film don't realize the challenge George Lucas had in rewinding his famous saga and telling a story that started in the middle from the very beginning.  It was over twenty years after the first film, a LONG time to keep fans waiting.  Filmmaking had grown technologically by this time, but Lucas had to keep the simplicity of Episodes IV-VI.  But still it had to be interesting, the casting of younger characters had to be right, it had to be accurate, it had to give hints......see?  This is a lot for a director/producer to think about.
I think ""Episode I"" pulled off all of its set tasks quite well.  It wasn't perfect, but it was good enough to warrant its big box office draw. It was also a nice starting point to build toward two bigger, better films with Episodes II and III.
The actors:  I think Liam Neeson was great as Qui-Gon Jinn.  He had the serenity of a most experienced Jedi and the power of a master of sabre battle.  Ewan McGregor, almost always a jewel, was the ideal to play the young Obi-Wan.  He nails the character that Sir Alec Guinness set forth for him, and his youthful energy gives a lot to the battle sequences.  Natalie Portman was more effective as Padme the handmaiden (or is she??) than she was as the stoic queen.  Her accent was like nails on a chalkboard during the Senate meetings and other conferences.  But that's okay.  She's better in Episode II.
Jake Lloyd....hmmmmmmm....he is young and precocious and cute, but there were probably better child actors out there who could have played this part.  I think Haley Joel Osment might have been good if not a little obvious.  Ray Park as Darth Maul: He is a man of few words, but big action.  He was fantastic and I was sad to see him killed off so early in this trilogy.  Samuel L. Jackson: can't wait to see him get more screen time.  Yoda: good to have you back if only for a moment.  Still a wise master, you are.
Finally, I will address the issue that bothered audiences the most: Jar Jar Binks.  When I first saw the movie, I liked Jar Jar.  I thought he was quirky and kind of cute. But he seemed out of place in this movie.  He was what I call the ""toy character"" in a science-fiction films.  He was someone for the kids to laugh at, and there's nothing necessarily wrong with that. Adults just find him a bit annoying after a while.
The action sequences:  MARVELOUS!!  Not too phony, yet not too realistic that a fantasy element is lost.  The light sabre battle was the best one I have ever seen.  When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan jump/flip across the platforms and land in front of Darth Maul, it is one of those moments that makes you go, ""Oh yeah, something's about to go down!""  (That aforementioned moment:  watch it in widescreen or you lose Obi-Wan on the right.  That irritated me about the VHS release.)  The pod race scene was very good and should be enjoyed in stereo/surround sound.  Turn it up, make it like NASCAR!
Overall, the movie was one of my favorites.  I know I'm biased because I'm a Ewan McGregor slave, but I did consider everything about this film so as to be fair.  I liked it, others didn't.  It happens.",1023753600,,3147,4.423344947735192

The similarities between this film (the 1st of 6) to possibly the weakest of the original 3 (Return of the Jedi, 6 of 6) are almost unbelievable. The final climactic scenes include a jedi battle, a land battle between an alien race created for children (Gungans/Ewoks), and a space battle. So you'd think Lucas would learn from his mistakes. Apparently not.
A lot of people have had a problem with the technology factor as well. For going so far into the past, the technology really appears to be better. Probably a side affect of the improved special effects.
I'd just like to add ""what ever happened to actors playing parts, and not EVERY character on the screen being a digital creation? If this keeps up, whats the point of even making a movie with actors?

659891,5,6303454038,"I remember after seeing Episode I at the theater in 1999, I thought it was the biggest disappointment in cinematic history.  At the time, the only actor/character I liked was Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala.  The most poignant memory of the movie in my head was Ewan MacGregor delivering the corniest lines in the movie (""You were right about one thing, the negotiations WERE short"") with an even cornier look on his face.  I also remember disliking Jar Jar Binks, but not all that much.
After seeing and enjoying Episode II, my Star Wars interest was piqued again to a crazed level for the first time since fifth grade.  So, I bought the Episode I DVD just because I didn't want to be missing any of the episodes in my movie collection.  I watched it again, remembering how boring the podrace sequence was and how corny and cartoonish the big battle at the end was ... but then, I was surprised!  I was genuinely enjoying the movie more than Episode II.  The podrace was more exciting than I remembered, the CGI creatures and real life humans blended together seamlessly, corny lines from Obi-Wan were a generally miniscule part of the movie, and Jar Jar was almost likeable.  I recommend giving Episode I a second chance, and make sure to watch it on the DVD.",1023408000,,1262,4.602678571428571

While most people seem to find the Episode I plotline to be boring, or what have you, I actually thought it was a good story.  The lightsaber battle with Darth Maul was definitely the highlight of the movie for me.
Episode II is better than this, so if you haven't seen that, go to a theater near you NOW! :)",1023321600,,396,4.351351351351352
659893,3,6303454038,"This is what DVD's are made for.  The plethora of special features makes this possibly the best put together DVD out there right now, all DVD's should be made like this, but now onto the movie itself.  From the start, Episode 1 had a lot going against it.  Few people thought it could live up to the original trilogy, combined with the hammy acting and excessive CGI effects, not to mention everyone's constant bitching and moaning about Jar-Jar Binks, I was surprised it made as much money as it did (then again its a Star Wars movie).  Ewan McGregor is great as the young Obi-Wan, while Liam Neeson brings a strong, silent edge in his role.  Jake Lloyd however, can't act to save his life.  All his lines sounded so forced and unconvincing, not to mention the fact this is the kid who is supposed to become Darth Vader, I just can't see that cute little kid becoming such an evil force.  Ray Park is good as Darth Maul, only I wish we could have seen more of him, and the final fight scene is great as well.  George Lucas has totally commercialized the Star Wars saga, and it shows here which drags the movie down a lot (he had said he thought about casting N*Sync as Jedi Knights in Episode 2 to please his daughter), and the total credibility that the series once had quickly fades away by the time the credits start rolling.  However, I'm thankfull that Episode 2 is much better than Episode 1, but hardcore Star Wars fans will love it either way.  Bottom line: great DVD, ok movie.",1023321600,,1487,4.413919413919414
659894,4,6303454038,"As a Star Wars fan, I was of course excited and overwhelmed by all of the publicity and hype for what was then the upcoming ""Phantom Menace.""  I must admit, I read as many articles, watched as many interviews, listened to as many tracks from the soundtrack, and tuned in to as many radios programs for inside scoops as I was able to.  I even waited in line for an hour and a half just to get tickets a week in advance! Yes, you're probably thinking I am a loser, and you are probably right.  Anyways, I saw the movie the day it came out and like everyone else in the theater I walked out of the movie feeling like I had just been on some awesome journey, wanting more.  The new special effects were astounding to behold and single-handedly transported you to another universe altogether.  I fear that maybe this film relied too heavily on its explosions, battles, computer generated characters and background filler, that there was not much left for storyline and character development.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good motion picture but I think it should have dealt with less comedic relief (Jar Jar Binks)and more solid progression of story.  At some points I thought to myself that many of the jokes were just unnecessary slapstick comedy.  I guess I was just expecting something more mature and plot driven.  It was difficult to critique this movie, and possibly I am being too picky because of my viewpoint of a big fan of the series.  But all in all, ""Phantom Menace,"" now finally after a very long wait on DVD, is an action-packed fun movie for the whole family.  It is full of twists and turns that follow Obi-wan Kenobi (played by Ewan McGregor) Anakin Skywalker (played by Jake Lloyd), and the reserved Queen Amidala (played by the lovely Natalie Portman) as they fight to free Naboo (Amidala's home planet) from the invasions of the evil Trade Federation.  We are introduced to new characters such as Qui-Gon Jinn, Nute Gunray, Darth Maul, and the mysterious Darth Sidious along the way.  The DVD offers behind the scenes footage as well as many interesting scenes that did not make it into the film itself.  Some of these scenes may shed some light on the plot, but most of them are simply fun to watch.  There is also a commentary included where the director George Lucas and the producer Rick McCallum talk about the process of making the film and inside stories that went along with its production. The picture quality as well as the sound quality is astounding, making the experience of Episode I all the better.  In short this DVD will be a great addition to the present saga, and is a must have in the home of whatever degree of Star Wars fans.",1023235200,,2665,4.555555555555555
659895,5,6303454038,"There is NOTHING out there that could beat this DVD. This is how ALL DVDS should be released in the first place. It has all the extras that DVD buffs dream of. From exclusive commentary by the film makers, to deleted scenes, to documentaries, to multi-angle sequences, to featurettes, production photos, postesr, ad campaigns, and exclusive StarWars.com content. Absolutely amazing.
The picture quality cannot be beaten. When filmed digtally, it looks absolutely amazing on the movie screen. The transfer has absolutely no artifcats at all. It's just as clear as it was on the movie screen.
The sound is wonderful. The best sound is 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound. Many DVDs have this, but this DVD destroys all their quality. The podrace sequence shakes the walls, the lightsabers snap-hiss and hums echo through the air. Nothing can beat this.
The extras...Lucas proves he is a movie-making god. Just watching the making-of net featurettes will make you appreciate the film so much more. The hour-long documentary is stunning. The deleted scenes...they don't add much to the story at all, but it's always good to see deleted scenes around. The multi-angle sequnces blow away the multi-angle sequences on the Unbreakable DVD. Seeing the submarine chase and the first lap of the podrace from storyboards to animatics is just fun. The trailers...just brings back the excitement and anticipation of Episode I. The music video it just like a trailer. Nothing to special, but it's a wonderful piece of music. All in all, the best set of extras on any DVD.

659896,4,6303454038,"Face it, you either love EP 1 or you hate it.  I happen to like it mainly because the lightsaber battle scenes are phenomenal and you get insight as to how the series began and you can start to see how all this fits into the original 1970's-era Star Wars trilogy.  Meeting R2D2, C3PO and Anakin AND KNOWING what will eventually become of them is somewhat fascinating.  Granted, the addition of Jar Jar was added for comic relief, but he is annoying and a large part of what made Episode I so bad in many viewer's opinions.  If you look past that, the rest of the film is excellent and if you recall, Return of the Jedi had a similar childish theme when the Ewoks were introduced and they were just as annoying.
The film is pretty good as far as VHS is concerned.  The mastering process was done well and the packaging matches the newly released Star Wars Trilogy (Episodes 4, 5 and 6) so you can put them on your movie collection shelf and have a consistent look.  Not much in the way of extras (none actually) but that's what the DVD version is for.",1023148800,,1050,4.304568527918781
659958,5,6303454038,"Assuming that you already like this movie enough to consider buying the DVD, this is a GREAT set to own.  There is a ton of extra material in this set, and it is all very interesting and informative for you if you are a Star Wars fan.
It is not actually one DVD, but two.  The first DVD is the movie, with the regular soundtrack, and then a very interesting commentary soundtrack with George Lucas and some of the other important players that helped bring the movie to life.  I especially liked the commentary on the sound effects -- it's interesting to hear the tricks used to make the sounds for the pod racers and the ships.  For example, they recorded a refrigerator motor and used it as the engine for one of the ships.
The second DVD has a short, documentary-like feature about deleted scenes.  There was an entire lap of the pod race cut out that you will get to see.  Lots of commentary goes with each deleted scene, including how it was made, and why it was cut out.
The second DVD also has a made-for-DVD documentary about the making of the movie.  It shows basically everything from the Anakin Skywalker tryouts to the very first screening.  It includes a lot of behind-the-scenes look at how the animation was done.  It shows the lightsaber fight at the end being rehearsed and shot too.  Great stuff.
And of course, the DVD includes the obligatory trailers.  Those are always fun to watch.
If you are a big Star Wars fan, or if you just liked this movie, then this one is a can't miss.",1023148800,,1498,4.410909090909091
659959,5,6303454038,"First off, let's get a few things about the movie out of the way:
1. The Force. I don't think that they used it enough. If you really watch it, the force is only used a few times in the movie.
2. Medichlorians. The explanation for the way the force works is totally bogus! There should not have been ANY explanation. Nobody WANTED an explanation!
3. Anakin. First of all, Jake Lloyd is a horrible actor. His high, whiny voice was annoying. There was also no evidence that he was going to become this person who is practically evil incarnate. Getting back to Jake's acting though, he didn't really use any real inflection in his voice. He'd say something like ""Uh oh, R2, I think we're in trouble"" like he was ordering an ice cream cone or something. Also, the part at the end where he accidentally destroys that ship is corny and stupid.
4. Jar Jar.
Those are the major problems I had with this. Everything else, and I really do mean EVERYTHING else was perfect. Except for the lightsaber battles, which were absolutely phenomenal.
So, enough about the movie, everyone's seen it anyway. On to the DVD. Forget T2, forget Die Hard, forget EVERYTHING! Because this is simply the best DVD ever to grace the marketplace. Yes, you may have seen a hundred other reviews for a hundred other movies that flippantly say the same thing, but I'm serious. This is THE BEST DVD ever:
1. Sound and video quality: Come on, this DVD comes from the guy who invented the companies THX and ILM. Is there any doubt that this is going to have the best possible sound and video? Of course not.
2. The Beginning: Making Episode I. This is the best and the truest documentary ever. I say the truest because it isn't the filmmakers being interviewed about the film or anything like that, it is the ACTUAL making of the film. You see all kinds of things that went into the making of the film. Storyboarding, budget meetings, the shooting of scenes, the casting of the role of Anakin, a test screening of the movie with Lucas, McCallum, and a few other people involved in making the film, all the way up to the opening night of the movie. The best part is this documentary isn't biased or promotional, as most other purported DVD ""documentaries"" are. The documentary is honest and therefore, much more interesting and insightful than we would even have had a right to expect. Anyway, just let me say this: no matter how good you may think this documentary is going to be, it will be better. Oh yeah, and it ends with Lucas beginning the script to Episode II in his ""home office"", which is cool.
3. Deleted Scenes: These are some of the best and most significant deleted scenes ever to be released on DVD since the Godfather Collection. And yet they even go beyond THAT, and add an entire half hour documentary that is specifically about the deleted scenes. Amazon has already listed what the scenes are if you look above, so I won't list them again. But, they are relevant to the movie, not just thrown in to make the DVD look good. And the accompanying documentary (telling you why directors cut scenes, and how the editing process works) is interesting also.
4. Web Documentaries: If you are a big Star Wars fan, then you would have seen these already, but even so, I'm sure you'll be glad that they are included. For those who haven't seen them, they are 12 mini-documentaries that each focus on a different aspect of the movie making process. They are each just about 5 minutes long or something like that (it may be longer, I don't remember exactly), so they add over an hour more of how Episode I got made. Any fan will find these interesting.
5. Featurettes: These are five little features which discuss even more about the making of this film. They cover the costumes, the fight scenes, the story, design, and special effects. These I'm pretty sure are all just under 10 minutes, so they add a little over half an hour of behind the scenes info. There is also about a 4 minute featurette about the making of the Star Wars: Starfighter video game, which is really more of a commercial, but still worth viewing.
6. Animatics: If you are like me, you looked at the extras on this DVD, and said to yourself ""What the hell are animatics?"" Well, I'll tell you. Basically, it shows you how two scenes were created; from storyboard to final cut. The two scenes are the Pod Race and the Submarine sequences. Also included is a 10 minute introduction to these scenes in which the whole production process is explained. In this section of the DVD, you will also find the print advertisements for the movie, including posters and other things. Not the best part of the DVD, but interesting to go through once or twice.
7. Trailers: The trailers, teasers, and TV spots are really cool in my opinion. I know that they are on every DVD, and really aren't anything that special, but I love to watch these things. In this section of the DVD you will also find the ""music video"" of the Duel of the Fates. This is an extremely cool extra. Trust me, you'll love it.
8. Commentary: Again, I know that you have read this in many other reviews for other movies, but this is the best DVD commentary ever. It stays focused on the scenes in the movie, and doesn't go wandering about into other things that no one is even interested in hearing about. Trust me, this is one of the few commentaries that is not only worth listening to, but worth listening to MULTIPLE times.",1023062400,,5425,4.514227642276423

659964,3,6303454038,"I was really rooting for George and Co. in anticipation of this long-awaited prequel, but like many Star Wars fans I found the dreadfully-titled Phantom Menace to be little more than a sophisticated children's movie. This problem is partly due to the age of the protagonist, although not enough effort was made to maintain the adult interest factor.
The original Star Wars trilogy was intelligently written, brilliantly cast, produced and directed, and hardcore enough to appeal to anybody of any age. Yet in spite of a good cast, which includes such giants as Sam Jackson and Liam Neeson, Phantom Menace (what a ghastly Fifties pulp title) cannot hold a candle to the original movies.
This quality DVD is worth having for the sake of completeness, especially in view of the fact that Episode 2, the almost as weakly titled Attack Of The Clones, appears to be far more like the original Star Wars. More combat, more edge and more maturity.
I wish I could be more postive about this, but there was more Menace in the Mel Brooks spoof.",1022457600,,1033,4.776536312849162
659965,5,6303454038,"I remember walking out of the theater 3 years ago after having seen this and thinking ""That was a damned good movie, I sure got my money's worth!"" Well, didn't take long to find out not everyone shared my sentiments. I guess it was to be expected. After all the hype and the waiting, the fans wanted nothing less than for George Lucas to smash a grand slam homer right out of the park, so when instead he hit a solid triple, a lot of people felt cheated and let down, and so they focused on what they didn't get more than on what was delivered.
Which is a shame. Phantom Menace is a fine film in its own rights. In part, some of the complaints were because it was different from the others. Most notably, the comradeship of familiar characters was missing, the interplay between the heroes, heroines and sidekicks as they grew to trust each other and deal with their various character traits as they bounced from one close call to the next. There was no romance to speak of (unlike the great Han Solo/Princess Leia exchanges) nor was there much humor (as in the interplay between Chewbacca and the two `droids) and of course the central character is one we all know will soon transform into the evil villain of the first trilogy. In short, it simply doesn't have a lot of the key elements that everyone loved from the earlier films.
But so what? Like I said, this one is different, and should be judged on its own merits. What is good about this film? For starters, the awesome effects. Let's face it, that's what MADE the Star Wars franchise, lose them, and you've got just a pretty decent space fairy tale. There's some really cool concepts, too, I especially liked the various types of Battle Droids, and would not be surprised to see this idea become reality in our own military some time in the near future. Also, you've got a deeper, darker, more serious mood. There's not too much in the way of yuks and joking around because anyone with vision can see that this particular Galaxy is headed for serious trouble. There's Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala, who, IMHO, is an even better female lead than Carrie Fisher. She's got the same strength of character, only in a different guise. Instead of a feisty, resourceful rebel Princess, she, despite being only 18 or so, leads with great dignity and poise. Darth Maul is another great character, the only downside is he wasn't given more screen time. Young Annakin Skywalker comes off just as we'd expect, he's a slave, but clearly destined to move on to much bigger things. We are left wondering just how it is this budding Jedi ends up making the choice to side with evil, not to mention how he will interact with his future wife and son. We are left hanging deliciously, wondering just what Episode Two will serve up.
As for the bad, well, basically it can be summed up in three words - Jar Jar Binks. Rarely has a more annoying and useless character been given so much screen time in a major movie. He's funny ..... for maybe a minute or two. Then he should have been given the boot. Yet he seems to be onscreen almost as much as Luke in the original! What on Earth for? He brings nothing to the film to justify being so prominent. Further, he turns an otherwise really cool final battle scene into a 3 Stooges style comic farce in which he blunders about the battlefield taking out the enemy through sheer incompetence and dumb luck (maybe I should change the comic reference to Gomer Pyle). Anyway, if ever this film is subject to digital editing, Jar Jar should be ""erased"" from every scene where it is practical to do so. On a more minor note, I was less impressed than most by the Pod Race. Sure, it was cool but so is an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo. And both are more a case of artistic showing off than anything else. The Pod Race was special effects for its own sake, and didn't really add anything of importance to the movie.
But, other than that, this was definitely a far better than average film. It's just too bad that didn't live up to public expectations that were, quite honestly, so high as to be nearly impossible for mere mortal man to achieve.",1022457600,5,4120,4.4655172413793105

659967,3,6303454038,"Well  -  it's not as bad as Return of the Jedi, but then what is?
George Lucas completely reinvented Star Wars for a new generation, starting with this glorified kids' movie.  And that is its greatest flaw:  it's made for kids.  And, pretty much, for kids alone.  The original series was made for adults, but inclusive of kids  -  this new series is made for kids, and not of great interest to adults.
In the movie's favor, the effects are incomparably good, as is only to be expected.  The action is fast and furious, the pod race and the concluding robot battle especially.  The light sabre duel with Darth Maul, and his phenomenal acrobatics throughout, are almost worth the price of admission alone.
But the film is dreadfully short of substance, even for a Star Wars entry.  The characters are mere sketches, not fully developed individuals.  When Obi-Wan met his demise at the hands of Darth Vader in the original Star Wars in 1977, the audience gasped.  When one of the Jedi Knights is similarly dispatched in The Phantom Menace, there is less any kind of emotional impact than the mere passing thought, ""Well, I guess he zigged, when he shoulda zagged.""  The spectacle is still present  -  indeed, vastly improved  -  but the heart and soul of the series just isn't there.  Worst of all, the Jedi Knights themselves, who seemed so glamorous and exciting twenty years ago, in this installment (and in the following Attack of the Clones) come off more as a self-important organization consisting of pompous superiors and obsequious underlings.

However, I think 'The Phantom menace' is a horrible film. I just think Lucas should have left the legendary trilogy as it was, but since he decided to make new episodes, at least he could have done it better.
The phantom menace is very bad, in my opinion: the actor's interpretations is simply absent (how can an actor transmit credible expressions talking to a blue screen, talking to no-one?), the so worshipped effects are nothing to me: many people love computer effects, but I just think they're too obvious. When I see the old films, ok the effects are old-fashioned today but I believe what i see: now, I only see computer images: they're so obvious, I feel I'm seeing a cartoon and not real images. The evil character has the personality of an egg. There's the most upsetting and hateful character ever made, a guy with elephant-ears and simply unlistenable voice. And there's a race scene which gets more and more boring. and... is there a story?

While Phantom Menace isn't was good as the original trilogy, or Attack Of the Clones, The Phantom Menace is still a worthy inclusion in the Star Wars saga. My only major complaint is that annoying character Jar Jar Binks. But I got around him rather quickly. Other than that, this is an exciting chapter in the Star Wars saga.
The trade federation is setting up a trade boycott of the planet Naboo. Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) sends two Jedi knights named Qui Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) to negotiate with the federation. But Lord Sideous has other plans. An invasion of Naboo. Qui Gon and Obi Wan escape with Amidala from Naboo, and are heading for Coruscant. But the ship breaks down, and they are stranded on the planet Tatooine. There, they meet Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) a young boy with extraordinary talents. Qui Gon decides to take him to Coruscant to be trained as a Jedi. Meanwhile, Sideous sends his apprentice Darth Maul (Ray Park) to capture the queen so she can sign a treaty making their invasion legal. On Coruscant, Amidala decides she wants to form an army with Jar Jar's natives to take back her planet, and save her people.

660024,3,6303454038,"Phantom Menace is a futuristic sci-fi film about stock car racing.  The movie starts out with two English fellas dressed in medieval pajamas.  They run into a character named Jar-Jar Binks who looks like a walking platypus and talks like a sissy Jamaican.  He takes them to an under water city where the people look like frogs and talk like Africans except for the two bad guys who sound like Japanese samuri.
Somehow the English fellas and the platypus end up in southern Utah.  That's where the big stock car race is held, except these stock cars are powered by twin jet engines and don't have any wheels.  Most of the drivers are alien critters who look like something even my mean old tomcat wouldn't drag in.  Which is just as well cuz you don't feel bad when they get killed which is pretty often.
One of the English fellas wants a little boy to race his car but the boy is busy being a slave to a giant flying bug who talks.  The bug ain't too slick and the English fella gets him to agree to letting the little boy drive.  Once the race begins the little boy doesn't have to do anything but hold onto the handlebars which is real fortunate because he couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag.
After the race is over they drag the movie out way too long.  A bunch of stuff happens that don't make no sense, part of it involving some weird chick with a lipstick impairment and a  practical joker for a hair dresser.  One of the English fellas gets killed and they never make it back to Utah.  Reckon that's in the next film.
I give this film three stars.  The stock cars crash real good but they should have put the race at the end of the film.",1022112000,6,1653,4.242811501597444

The only problem I have with that statement is the fact that all the previous Star Wars films were not Shakespeare. These movies were not made famous because the actors had breath-taking lines. Episode IV was loaded down with cheesy dialogue. True, the film does lag at times, but it more than accomplishes what it was designed to do. To introduce the characters that have a direct impact on the future of the Republic and the events that will take place in the latter half of the series.

Well, in the past twenty years, R-rated films pushed the envelope of violence so far forward, that when The Phantom Menace came out, people forgot that it was just a PG rated film.  I think that they were expecting it to be an R rated film.  For a PG film, it's great.  For a sci-fi film, it's great.  I even think that JarJar Binks is ok.

660102,4,6303454038,"Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace may very well have been the most anticipated movie of all time. Since it was first announced many years ago, people (myself include) were eagerly waiting with baited breath, saving up their cash for those tickets, and getting their tents cleaned up for an overnight stay at the movie theater just to see the first prequel to George Lucas' seminal Star Wars trilogy. So it is only natural that some were a little disappointed walking out of the theater.
Well, as possibly a rare voice in the pool of criticism, I will state that Episode 1 is a solid attempt at explaining how the whole Star Wars saga ""began"" (in storyline of course).
The first thing you will probably notice when seeing Episode 1 is that it ""feels"" a lot different from previous Star Wars films. The primitive picture quality of the (non-remastered) original trilogy is missing here, as are many of the original characters (namely Han, Luke, Leia, and Lando) we all grew to know and love. Most importantly, however, the fact that this is a prequel to a trilogy that ended 19 YEARS AGO takes away much of the film's potential nostalgia (considering the long way film and computer technology has come since 1983's Return Of The Jedi).
Even if you haven't seen Episode 1 just yet, you probably know the plot revolves around young Anakin Skywalker (soon to be Darth Vader), and his upcoming quest to become a Jedi Knight. George Lucas had quite a task on his hands explaining how the Rebel Alliance, the Empire, etc. came to be. And Episode 1 does a fairly good job explaining some of the initial details. Darth Vader is of course still Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan is a very young man attempting to train Anakin as a Jedi knight (his big mistake), and Senator Palpatine (soon to be Emperor Palpatine, or just ""The Emperor"" for those that haven't read the Star Wars books) is blatantly hiding his true colors in a sea of kindness/dignity.
Unfortunately, the plot itself could have used a few tweaks. The movie's opening, for example, is very vague and does a poor job explaining what's actually going on. As could the acting crew. Jar Jar Binks I probably don't need to go into too much detail with, but Jake Lloyd's performance as Anaken Skywalker was IMO just about as annoying. It's obvious the young actor was very excited about being part of the new Star Wars films. So at times he seems quite a bit more excited than he needs to be. On the bright side, both the pod-racing sequence and the battle with Darth Maul were very well done.
Overall, Star Wars Episode 1 is one of those movies that will probably grow on you once the entire Star Wars prequel trilogy is complete. Everything will finally tie in with the original trilogy, and the prequels (including Episode 1) will make more sense. As it is, I recommend everybody gives this movie a chance. With a little patience and an open mind, you may actually like it.",1021507200,8,2922,4.631984585741812
660103,1,6303454038,"How could Lucas have managed to so thoroughly kill everything that was cool about the original trilogy?  This movie is an overlong, poorly-written, horribly acted series of merchandising tie-ins.  (There might as well have been a flashing subtitle during the pod race sequence that said ""BUY THE VIDEO GAME"".)  ""The Force"", originally conceived as a manifestation of spiritual development, is now explained away as the result of tiny organisms living in a person's blood.  I hear that in Episode 2, Yoda grabs a light saber and starts carving people up -- the same Yoda who said ""War does not make one great"".  What's next, ""Gandhi 2: Revenge of the Mahatma""?!?!  Lucas has obviously lost the instinct and talent he had while making the first 3 movies.
The last movie I can remember that was as disappointing as this when compared to the original was ""Highlander 2"", and as in the case of the Highlander movies, I'm going to do my best to pretend that the new sequels don't exist.",1021507200,7,980,4.769230769230769
660104,5,6303454038,"After reading several of the 2032 reviews of The Phantom Menace I can see where the purist would find this movie disappointing. But allow me to present an alternative view.
I recently bought this tape for my son and after watching it I was reminded of what attracted my generation to the Star Wars phenomenon in the first place; it is a fantastically fun film series that has never failed to excite us and keep us on the edge of our seats!
It took watching the wonderment on my 8 year old's face to make me cognizant of the fact that this movie makes no claim on having any greater depth of meaning than what you see. Annakin Skywalker by far steals the show, along with the sometimes irksome Jar-Jar Binks.
My advice to you if you have been hesitating to watch this, or any of the other ""sequels"" is to go ahead and do it! You won't be disappointed if you can keep in mind why you fell in love with George Lucas' work in the first place.
But if you want to be like so many of the 2000+ reviewers and take a foray into the world of pedantry, looking for some deep cosmic, esoteric significance in every nook and cranny of the film, you will indeed be disappointed.",1021507200,5,1164,4.271493212669683

No it's not the Apocalypse; it is the hype related to the screening of Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. Although to many it might as well have been the end of the world since the most anticipated film of all time (undoubtably the most anticipated prequel to a cult classic ever) was the biggest letdown of all time.
The film has divided fans into three different groups: Those who were let down by the movie, those who were let down but love Star Wars so much they will never speak badly of it (ie 30 year old teenagers living in their parents' basement) and those who (gasp!) actually enjoyed it (the most deranged members of this group say they prefer this over the original trilogy and/or actually like Jar Jar Binks).
This film is filled with major flaws such as the poorly written (and poorly acted) Anakin Skywalker (how in the world can a kid so young build a robot and podracer if he is a slave?). Anakin's accidental destruction of the Trade Federation ship  is pretty much a farce. Perhaps Anakin's line from that scene says it all; ""Oops!""
The battle droids were pathetically flawed (geez, if I was building an army I definately would not make them mindless fools) and did not have the grunt stupidity that the good old Stormtroopers have. And if they are so mindless, why waste time having them talk?
All this could be forgiven if not for the greatest evil ever unleashed. Now we come to the major villain in all of Star Wars history: Jar Jar Binks. This frog-like Jim Crow minstrel with his awful speech impediment ruined the film. His pathetic clumsiness and shoddy dialogue made him the slapstick of the film; perhaps fill the void left by the present but minor C-3PO and R2-D2. At C-3PO had the whole gay pride thing going for him; Jar Jar is just annoying. With all the hatred people have for the frog freak, it is a wonder that Burger King or McDonalds haven't been granted permission to start production of the Jar Jar Burger; made from real Gungan.
This will always be remembered as the worst Star Wars film ever (unless Episode 3 is terrible; but I don't think so). I watched the original trilogy over 100 times each over two years. This film will never make that grand total in my lifetime. Ed Wood's B-film classic ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", Peter Jackson's ultra gore indie ""Bad Taste"" and the badly acted ""Crawling Hand"" are more entertaining than this film.",1021507200,4,2624,4.6068376068376065

Pros:
-Good plot

-Many new species, Some more annoying than others
-Superb special effects
-Cool destroy droids (at least something can worry a jedi)

Cons
-End battle dissapointing (Focuses on Anikan way to much!!!)
-Anikan!!! The great 9- year old podracer, builder,  mechanic, slave, whatever!!
-The gayest battle droids ever
-Anikan was a terrible actor
-Qui-Gon-Jin was a terrible actor
-Jar Jar Binks the annyoing thing no on likes

660107,1,6303454038,"I remember way back to 1977 or so...  I was 16 years old, and caught a glimpse of a TV ad for the new ""Star Wars"" movie.  It was almost being presented as an art film at first.  My friends who had seen this thing were raving about it.  I was intrigued -- I had always been a Trekkie, and this looked like a better version of Roddenberry's more thoughtful outings.  It turned out to be more of a space cowboy story, with overtones of the mythic (like the better spaghetti westerns)...  but it was nonetheless a great movie that offered a lot of fun on the surface, and more to think about if one chose.  What has happened to these promising beginnings?  Lucas has retreated to the same place all big-budget movie makers seem to have gone since the mid-80's:  An orgy of special effects.  The Star Wars saga has become increasingly dependent on computerized magic, and correspondingly increasingly pretentious.  The Phantom Menace was technically brilliant but otherwise a terrible film.  Sorry George -- I know how much work you've put into this, and I thank you for that -- but PLEASE, can we get back to the kind of thinking that went onto the first film?  A little understated legend would be much better than all that pretentious foreshadowing.  Think small -- score big.

Yoda knew something was up.  He might not have cared.

Obi-Wan was merely a foot soldier.  He didn't know about this conspiracy.

Anakin's destiny was to wipe out the Jedi.  They had grown too corrupt.  In the beginning of the movie, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are dispatched to bring a settlement to a trade negotiation.  The Neomoidians were scared to death.  The Jedi, guardians of the light side of the Force, were being used as tools of government.  To this end, they were abusing their Jedi powers.  Qui-Gon knew this.  He didn't like it.  He listened and obeyed the living Force, and put up with the politics because he was a Jedi, and could not practice outside the Order.

Qui-Gon Jinn didn't care about politics at all.  He had zero interest in The Council's mandates.  He was disgruntled with the way the Republic used the Jedi to settle its matters.  When a chance to restore balance to the Force came along, he jumped at it.  Evidence:

The Order knew Anakin had too much fear.  Qui-Gon must have known this too.  He was at least as capable as anyone in the order.  Still, he was going to discard his current padawan and train the boy.  Obi-Wan: ""They all know he's dangerous.  Why don't you?""  Qui-Gon still insisted.

The atmosphere of the movie has no suspense, no lurking danger, no sense of imminent disaster like the others. IT's all about trying hard to create a new phenomenal franchise in the style of Star Trek. But all the Star Trek movies at least had a soul of their own.

Jar-Jar binks was a bad comic relief.

660111,4,6303454038,"I first saw Phantom Menace about two weeks after it hit the box office. I had already heard all of the negative criticism. Time Magazine defamed the film as a ""Big Disappointment"": Targeting, especially, the young, untalented Anakin Skywalker for his poor delivery, and (I quote) ""Plain old bad acting"". It is a film that finnatics desperately wanted to take seriously. It was possibly the most anticipated feature of our time. I ask you, ""What film could measure up to that kind of hype?""
I admit, the movie wasn't perfect, but after walking out of that theatre, I remember wondering what the hell those critics had been talking about. Phantom Menace engages viewrs head on, from the opening scene, right up until the ominous, forbrooding, ending. It maintains a delicate equipoise of fantastical, thought provolking Political interactions, and over the top high speed action. Liam Niesson, and Ewan McGregor play convincing off eachother, in their respective roles, as Jedi master and apprentice. As a devout fan of the original trilogy, I was not disappointed at all.
Ok, that said, I will agree that this movie went overboard with some irratating instances of comic relief. Jar-Jar Binks deserves every negative bit of criticism he got. But even more annoying, was the unessecary incorpoartion of old characters into the story. What was the point of having C3PO, and R2D2 in the film? They had no consequence to the plot. They fell exasperingly short of funny, and the film was already annoying enough with Jar-Jar. The actor who played young Anakin really was cheesey, and totally ruined certain, potentially powerful scenes. Natalie Portman's coherced monotone also gets pretty darn annoying after 2 hours.
But, I am a fair critic. The faults were not overwhelming enough to warrant all the negative criticism, generated by obsessed fans. I didn't want the film to end. Maybe its because I entered Phantom Menace with some very low expectations, but I left being very pleasantly surprised. It acoplished its obejective: To set the stage.",1021248000,2,2043,5.083333333333333

I couldn't wait to see this movie.  Then I did.  I must say this: I liked it.  I definitely do not have the same respect for this one as I do for the original trilogy, but I liked it.  Although I did think that Jake Lloyd could have acted better, and that Jar Jar was a little exuberant.  Anyway, years before the time of the Empire, there was the Old Republic.  Each intelligent species would have a Senator on Coruscant, the capitol planet, later featured as Leia and Han's home when they become leaders of the New Republic.  The Trade Federation have decided to blockade a small peaceful planet, but their intentions are unknown.  We soon learn that they are not behind it, but a Sith Lord named Darth Sidious.  The Sith were a group of Jedis who used their power for evil, but they eventually killed themselves.  Now, there are only two left: Darth Sidious and his apprentice, Darth Maul.  The Supreme Chancellor of the Senate dispatches two Jedi to help the planet Naboo in this ordeal, but when they rescue the Queen, they are forced to land on Tatooine, a desert planet.  They are stranded, and their only hope is a young boy named Anakin Skywalker.  He wins money for them in a race, and they are able to leave, but Qui-Gon Ginn decides to take Anakin with them because he believes that he has great potential to become a Jedi.  When they get to Coruscant, the Senator from Naboo, Palpatine (the future Emporor), informs them that the Chancellor will be unable to help them, and suggests that the Queen rally that the election for Chancellor be moved up.  When everyone gets back to Naboo, they all learn how to stop the Trade Federation, and each person has a different role.  The two Jedi get sidetracked, and must duel with Darth Maul.  For the most part, this movie was good, but it was more of a kid's movie than the others.  Rest assured, Episode II will return to the old format.  Also, as I said, Jar Jar and Jake Lloyd were the two biggest faults, and also, there is a scene where the Queen reveals a secret about her identity, and she could have waited for a more intense moment to tell everyone.

I just didn't feel drawn in into the conflicts in phantom menace and was bored, though the lightsaber scene near the end was pretty good. i give this DVD 3 stars only because the DVD is excellent. the hour-long documentary on the filming process is superb and may be worth getting this DVD....but not for the movie itself.

660167,1,6303454038,"In 1977, the original Star Wars (call it Episode IV if you prefer) changed the face of the movies. In an era of talky grown-up flicks and overwrought disaster pictures, the fun was finally back. Good guys were good, bad guys were bad, nobody really cared about why. There may have been cool gizmos and weird aliens, but this was an old-fashioned western crossed with a World War II movie, with a little bit of medieval chivalry and mysticism thrown in for fun. In short, the film was exciting from the first frame.
In 1999, the ""new and improved"" Star Wars (or Episode I for those who buy into such nonsense) had no discernible plot, incomprehensible dialogue, and uncharismatic characters who are neither good nor bad -- or maybe both at the same time, I don't know. Inexplicable action sequences are intercut with inexplicable dialogue sequences. Everybody on the screen looks so serious, as if they are doing something Very Important. Liam Neeson somehow manages to make being a Jedi knight look dull. This is not a western, nor is it a war movie, nor does it contain anything even the least bit chivalrous or mystical. It's greatest sin: This movie is boring from the first frame.
Frankly, if I wanted to watch people negotiate trade routes and treaties, I'd turn on C-SPAN.
Relentless special effects were not possible, nor were they necessary in 1977. All it took was a simple plot, characters who were just one step above types -- but charismatic -- and enough details to make us believe we were somewhere else for a couple of hours.
Limitations can force movie-makers to become better story-tellers. Lucas was limited by time and money back in the 70s, and that first film is a model of efficiency. Now there's nobody to say 'no' to him. The result, as probably could have been predicted, is a self-indulgent mess slathered with CGI. Yes, the effects in this movie are way cool. No, they did not make it any more palatable. No amount of effects or DVD extras can make up for a boring story.
I know that Lucas is trying to create a modern hero myth -- he has openly admitted as much. But he's clearly trying too hard. Time to get back to having fun, George.

660168,4,6303454038,"I remember the first time I saw ""Star Wars-Episode I: The Phantom Menace"". I was so impressed -with my mouth wide open -by the visual effects that I forgot the rest of the movie. The CGI effects marked a breakthrough so high that I didn't pay attention to the characters. When I came out of the cinema, I asked myself ""Was I really watching this movie?""
In a video documentary called ""From Star Wars To Jedi: The Making Of A Saga"", George Lucas said: 'Special effects are a tool, means of telling a story. Special effects without a story is a pretty boring thing'. Well, in my opinion, it seems he contradicted himself while filming ""The Phantom Menace"" because the movie almost became boring thanks to those spectacular, yet excessive, visual effects. He seemed to have forgotten how to direct his actors, especially Jake Lloyd, and the story fell down to a great second place. The Force appears to be no longer with Lucas.
However, I must admit that this DVD is fantastic. I mean the extras are truly superb. The documentary, that tells the process that Lucas and his team went through in making this film, is excellent; like a video journal on the production development. The deleted scenes are great, especially the one in which Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor), and Jar-Jar Binks escape from the Gungan transport before it falls down a waterfall. I mean all the extras are worthwhile.

660194,3,6303454038,"I know every time I see another Star Wars product with ""Limited Set,"" ""Collect all three,"" or ""Special Edition,"" today, I am going to heavily consider its actual contents.  There is this rule of nature I have found - the more you tamper or perfect things which already are at a high calibur, the more disappointed the result.  For example, it is like attempting to retake an Exam after you already recived an A+, twenty or so years after you first took it.  Very dangerous ground.
Watching THX-1138, I have seen Lucas altered his condemnation of ""Buy, buy more now...and be happy"" to a position where he is afraid to expose true art by worrying about numbers and percentages.  Personally, I think he is too critcal of critics, too set on traditional movie structure, and heavily concerned over quantity over quanity, perfection over natualism, and plot over character development.  The Phantom Menace, I find, proved not only the world, yet himself it is time to search for what is really attempting to be expressed.
Thank goodness this movie was made.
I am glad Phantom came out because it proved Star Wars to be simply a fictious story, not something which everything in your life should revolve around.  It was a wake up call to let everyone see how foolish it was getting, which was getting to a point where everything dealing with Star Wars seemed to be sent from God alone and taken as a literal Bible.  I like Lucas, and I believe him to be a very smart and wise person, very reserved and to himself, articulating only in the scripts of his movies.  Yet because of this movie, we will definitly be allowed to see Star Wars as it was intentionly meant for, and what it was all about.  For this reason, I do think Lucas will improve.  All he can do now is go up and learn with this experience, just as all of us can, and I am also glad he recived the reaction he did, because every director needs it in order to mature.  It will create better movies in the end.
There needs to be though a distinction of Phantom in relation to the SW movies, and movies overall.  If we were to agree with a rating, it probably would be two stars when compared to the saga, three stars compared to movies of today.

Unfortunately, this DVD has extra features that command more attention than the film itself.  I thought this film was done very well in some respects and I did find the story line interesting as I tried to tie in events from the previous films.  But this film is doomed to be the first part of a six part series so by nature it is slower.
The DVD looks great and sounds great.  The extras are voluminous.  Lucasfilm did a great job in that regard.  In the future, Lucas and Co. should worry more about having believable actors & actresses than CG backgrounds.

Principle flaws of Episode 1...
1) Virgin birth for Anakin. Umm, a virgin slave? get real...
2) Providing a hokey mechanism to explain the force. Worse, one that has a LOT of implications...
 a) agency-not just a product of life force, now it is a bunch of microbes with an agenda.
 b) if microbes give you power, they would be growing them in Vats.
3) Anakin, a nine year old, not only races BUT builds his vehicle and C-3PO. Right. Unnecesary bolony. Bringing C3po and R2D2 into this first series was unnecasary bolony as well.
4) Jar-Jar. Sure, what we needed was a disney style side kick for comic (albeit racially motivated) laughs. Uncle Remus rides the galactic wave, messuh yessuh three bads cotton full suhhh jar jar binks suhhh!!!)
5)Gee,obviously free trade is evil and best achieved through blockade.
6) Politics simple, to the point of being dumb. A stark contrast with the message of lord of the rings, of the lure of power on good people-who turn to darkness through doing the wrong thing for the right reason...

Nope. I was right. This [stinks] even more on second viewing. There won't be a third...
As a screenwriter wannabe, I read that you have to make villains smart and heroes smarter. Also, villains get all the lucky breaks in the final conflict. Heroes don't get any and that's what make them heroes - winning without luck or referee's help. This makes you feel satisfied in the end.
Having said that, in Phantom Menace the hero (Anakin) destroys the evil mothership by pure chance.
Oh, wait! Maybe he got the lucky break in advance because he becomes evil Darth Vader later... Yeah, right!

* Fanboi: Overused terminology, to be sure, but you know what's going on here. Has seen the first trilogy seventeen times. Laughs at ""Expanded Universe"" aficianados. Bought the ""Hardware Wars"" special edition for the special effects upgrade. Considers Episode I an abomination of all things bright and wonderful, especially Lucas' Unholy Trinity of Jar Jar, young Anakin, and the entire Gungan race.
* Kids: Don't know what everyone's all upset about. Decent movie, but no ""Empire"", that's for sure. Was that Jar Jar fellow supposed to appeal to us, by the way?
The biggest problem I had with this movie was that it seemed to go out of its way to insult the intelligence of its target audience, by which I mean children age 6-16. I don't like getting hit over the head with comic relief any more than kids do, and Jar Jar was just too much for anyone. But enough about the albatross.
From a more sober perspective, this movie has little else to be ashamed of. It's technically accomplished, sporadically riveting, and has a couple of truly great set-pieces (the podrace and the Darth Maul battle scenes). The really interesting buzz being generated by the upcoming Episode II is that it forces you to re-evaluate your stance on Episode I.

I had read the book, and the Graphic Novel in advance, so I knew exactly what I was getting into when the film began. My expectations for this film were set at a pretty good level. I knew the story already, and was expecting a movie version of that story as I knew it.
 The problem with Episode I is not necissarily the film itself. Although far from perfect Episode I is still creative, and innovative in its own right, and still revolutionary being the first movie to offer thousands of photorealistic computer generated characters in any given scene. The overal story is still very good, but I will confess the movie is not without its flaws.
 Jar Jar Binks became annoying after a while, but did not detract from the over all movie. I do not see Jar Jar in any light different than I see C-3PO, who is equally annoying. However, the dry acting of this film really weakens what could have otherwise been the best of the Star Wars movies to date. Despite the dry acting, the story (I cannot stress this enough) is still very strong. The movie even features the best lightsaber fight scenes to date. Over all this movie is not only worth the price of admission, but is also a worthy addition to the Star Wars series. A friend of mine once stated that to judge the Star Wars movies individually is foolish. This is just a small part of a much larger story, and while I anticipate that Attack of the Clones will be both darker and more mature than the Phantom Menace. In all reality The Phantom Menace is equally as good as A New Hope (Episode IV) which also has problems with acting and annoying characters (ironically Luke, at that point.)
 The DVD is the first of the series to land on the format and is quite possibly the most jam packed DVD of all time. I've had this disk since it came out and I am still finding nifty easter eggs several months later. And I don't think that there has ever been a DVD that has taken your hand through every step of the film making process the way that this one did. It was a great education in the making of the Star Wars movie, and sure made the process look lik a lot of fun, with a few hazards tossed in for good measure. The various making of featuretts are like an epic movie in and of themselves and are in many ways better than the movie itself.

Then you gotta write words that will inspire the actors.  These all tend to hold the audience's interest, causing them to remain awake.  I think Mr. Lucas needs to leave his version of a Neverland ranch or wherever it is that he holes up between movies and rediscover just what it was that inspired him to create the full-blooded thrill-ride that was the original Star Wars.

660244,2,6303454038,"Let's face it: ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" will forever be known as the worst Star Wars movie ever produced. Even people who seriously defend this movie have to agree Episodes IV, V, and VI were better. The big question concerning this movie: what went wrong? How could the most hyped movie of all time coin the term ""Episode I Syndrome""? The answer is simple: ""The Phantom Menace"" tries to be too much of what the first three movies were known for and fails to allow other factors have the same degree of quality.
When ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" was released, it was praised for its then-revolutionary special effects, and the next two movies received an equal amount of praise. But George Lucas also managed to give these movie a coherent and suitable plot so they wouldn't be seen as ""tech-demos"". When CGI evolved, movies started to use them more and more, until some movies were nothing but. ""Tron"", ""The Haunting"", and ""The Mummy Returns"" are all infamous examples of movies that utilized excellent special effects but had nothing else to show for it. ""Episode I"", unfortunately, joins this crowd.
The movie becomes questionable at the very beginning, when the famous Star Wars Theme plays and the opening paragraph runs. Unlike previous Star Wars openings, this one talks about...politics? We're introduced to the new Star Wars movie not with a galactic battle or terrible crisis, but politics? Why? Then we meet the two Jedi and immediately we sense something is wrong. Why is the dialogue so...stiff? Emotionless? Even flat? Aren't the two actors enjoying themselves? Aren't they glad they're in a legendary Star Wars movie? Sadly, the movie never tells us, because this kind of feeling remains throughout the entire movie.
Despite some really interesting battles, the central theme of the story remains politics, and this was Lucas's first mistake. Isn't the saga called Star WARS? Lucas' second mistake was his biggest: the CGI. Now, it's not that this CGI is bad; in fact, it's probably some of the best ever created for a film. The problem is that Lucas uses it far too much. It's as if in every other scene Lucas decided, ""I think I'll put a wow-inducing special effect here. It might not be necessary, but it'll look cool."" And sadly, the high use of CGI contributed to the low quality of plot and acting.
The plot is probably the flimsiet plot ever devised in a Star Wars film, and the actors don't seem to be enjoying themslves at all. We never connect with Liam Neeson's Qui-Con Jinn, and Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi doesn't match the one played by the late, great Alec Guinness. Jake Lloyd can't make us sympathize with the boy that'll eventually grow up to be Darth Vader, and Natalie Portman can't seem to push herself to be Queen Amidala. Probably the only characters who actually enjoy themselves are the entirely-CGIed ones such as Watto and Jar Jar Binks, but the trouble is most moviegoers find Jar Jar so annoying that they really don't care. This also shows that Lucas was probably more interested in the CGI effects than the actual actors.
How Star Wars fans see this film is very relative. Some don't mind it and actually like it; others find it a complete blasphemy to the Star Wars mythos (Midichlorians, anyone?). But everyone has to agree that George Lucas made some serious mistakes with this movie and that ""Episode I"" doesn't even compare to the three original movies. Whether or not ""Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" is merely a giant preview for the (hopefully) superior ""Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" we'll have to wait and see.

Frankly,they spent too much time on trying to WOW everybody with computer imagery,and they forgot to write an actual story,that mattered! Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman both give good performances,now if they only had a film to use them in! The film worries more about showing us all these ""really cool aliens"",and all these ""really cool planets and space ships"",than advancing the story. What purpose did the Pod Race serve? The Underwater Kingdom? Did we need the stereo type characters?

They are as flat and dull and seem to be inserted to let Lucas expand his digi-lands.  THe dialogue is sparse and uninteresting and there isn't the same feel as the other movies.

I think the tech-heavy feel of this movie had something to do with it.  Many will disagree, but I thought the kid who played Annakin was perfect and was one of the bright spots of the movie.  Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were fine but were given extremely little to work with.  The dialogue in the movie was rather dull and uninteresting unlike the vivid images and breathtaking special effects.  As one reviewer said, this movie was just an introduction to all the characters thus, the plodding pace of the movie.  However, if this would have been the beginning to the Star Wars saga, it would be a blip on the movie map, instead of a major destination.",1019865600,,1400,4.486166007905139

The characters of the movie graced everything from action figures to toothpaste bottles to inflatable chairs.  So it comes as no surprise that the movie didn't live up to everyone's expectations.  Many people complained to no end about it. But, when get past the hype and internet complaints, you have yourself a pretty decent movie.  Sure it had some bad parts.  Okay, it had some REALLY bad parts. The story wasn't all that fascinating, tha characterization is weak, Darth Vader's an exuberant little kid, And Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying character ever.  But the movie is still worthy of the Star Wars title.  I can't tell you how many times I was in gasping in awe of the sheer visuals in the film.  To me, the good redeems the movie for it's worser parts.  As for the legions of fans who hated this movie, I think they were expecting it to be like the first time theysaw Star Wars.  News flash for you folks: it's a slim chance that you'll ever have that experience again in your life.  Only the true fans can appreciate the film for what it is.

660268,5,6303454038,"I'll be the first to admit that I wasn't too impressed with The Phantom Menace upon first release. The plot seemed to have no relation to Episodes IV-VI, Jar Jar was annoying, and Obi-Wan didn't look or sound like, well, Obi-Wan.
Well, Episode II changed most of that.
Looking back at The Phantom Menace, it truely is not that different from Episodes IV-VI. Sure, the technology is better, and the budget is bigger, but it's in the same vein as IV-VI.
This DVD has set a high bar for the five following it to reach. The video and sound quality is excellent. The extras are par none. The commentaries provide interesting information, unlike many others. And the deleted scenes allow us to see what the Special Edition of Episode I will probably look like if Lucas is alive in 2019.
I only have one minor complaint: there were some other deleted scenes, even very small trims that would have required little/no effort to finish, that were left out, one of which (the ""swamp + active lightsaber = dead lightsaber"" snippet) is needed to make the Obi-Wan-chased-by-STAPs scene make sense.
All in all, definately worth the money.",1019865600,,1123,4.73469387755102
660269,4,6303454038,"As to the film, I think it speaks for itself.  Lucas has always been a groundbreaker in special effects.  ""Star Wars IV: A New Hope"" set the tone for a decade, and ""Episode I"" will do a similar thing.  Just look at all the mirror movies, such as A.I., or even ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" which was entirely computerized.
We know the story, and we know the flaws in the story.  I admit there is too much Jar-jar, but he is not the only character, or the only flaw in the film.  Overall, it is a good film that harkens back to the majestic epics of the 1950's that dazzled one young boy from modest Modesto California.  By the way, I have a lot of family in Stanislaus County, so I quite familiar with this town.  ""American Graffiti"" is quite accurate-all they could do there have car or pod races.
In my humble opinion two films, aside from Episodes IV-VI, are ""Ben-Hur"" and ""American Graffiti.""  ""Ben-Hur"" is the epics of epics that have influenced so many parodies on The Simpsons.  But it captures the majesty and magic that Hollywood once was.  Lucas, along with Spielberg, has brought back the glory days of the Golden Age of Hollywood.  ""The Phantom Menace"" is an attempt to bring the epic sweep to the sci-fi genre.  Asimov in ""Foundation,"" and Herbert in ""Dune"" captured the essence of epic in print, but Lucas was the first to bring this majesty (I apologize for repeating this word, but it is the only one that fits) to science fiction films.  Before him, we just had ""2001,"" although ""Planet of the Apes"" tried.
The second film was the aforementioned ""American Graffiti,"" which was Lucas's second film, and which paid for ""Star Wars.""  In my opinion, it is one of the funniest movies ever made.  There is not a lot of humor in Star Wars, but Lucas's working with Spielberg on the Indian Jones movies brought his forgotten talent to the surface.  That is why Jar-jar seems so out of place: the Star Wars films have been 98% serious, and when we have a comic relief Caliban (see ""The Tempest"" by Shakespeare), we don't know what to do.  ""The Phantom Edit"" took care of this problem.
I saw two problems with the film, both script problems.  The first is that Qui-Gon Jinn was not a consistent character.  During the first part of the movie, he is concerned about being patient, and then on a dime, he gets concerned about time and getting off of Tatooine.  The second problem is that Darth Maul didn't get the screen time he deserved.  We have a thoroughly hideous character, and intense fighter to boot, but we only see him in action twice.  If Lucas had him pick off Jedi Knights or members of the council along the lines of a mass murderer, he would have been far more sinister. Something along the lines of ""The Pelican Brief"" or ""Hannibal,"" but with the elegance of swordplay would have been better.
The DVD is perfection.  These discs show what DVD's were meant to be!  Disc Two is great.  It has seven deleted scenes that can be seen alone, in a group, or with a surrounding commentary to explain why they were removed.  There is an hour-long documentary on making the film, the commercials and theater trailers, plus the music video to ""Dual of the Fates.""  There are several featurettes and clips that explain the different aspects of the making of the film.  Apparently Lucas had a camera filming him as he was working from Day One on November 1, 1994 when he began writing the script.  You even see the binder in which he wrote ""American Graffiti,"" and the ""Star Wars"" movies.  There disc also works on your computer's DVD player where you can accesses more goodies on starwars.com.
The easter-eggs include a blooper reel: got to the THX logo on disc one, and type in ""1138,"" and the other one is on the delete scenes menu.
The film is not one of Lucas's best, but it is not as bad as people made it out to be.  Hopefully the rough edges will be filed down in Episode II.",1019779200,,3890,4.475177304964539

660271,5,6303454038,"George Lucas's original ""Star Wars"" trilogy is a brilliant, if incomplete, contribution to the world of film. With the prequel trilogy the story will finally be completed -- as the original trilogy told of the fall of the Empire, here at last is the story of its rising. ... I am immensly pleased with this beginning episode in the miniseries that ""Star Wars"" really is. It is my hope that someday not only the original half of ""Star Wars,"" but the entire six-part movie, will go down in film history with the word ""classic"" attached to it. It certianly is one in my mind.
Episode I is set a long time ago in the same galexy far, far away as the original three movies, but unlike the originals the galexy we see here is pretty much at peace. Instead of an all-out war, we see the evil Sith making their first subtle moves to bring down the Jedi Order and this said peace with it: The Trade Federation's blockade of the remote planet Naboo allows Senator Palpatine (Darth Siduos) to become Suprime Chancellor and by doing so sets a series of events into motion which will ultumately bring the fall of the Jedi, setting the stage for the original trilogy's story of rebellion and the return of peace, and it will be very interesting to see how exactly the Empire continues to rise in Episodes II and III. Episode I is indeed a very light, nonwar film, focusing instead on the arena of polotics, but the lightness here is needed to contrast the darkness that lies ahead, and I was expecting something of this sort.  It is a thrilling, if different, beginning to ""Star Wars,"" and one that I highly reccomend.
As for the DVD edition itself - all I can say about it is wow.  The film's presentation is flawless, and contains a previously unreleased deleted scene ""The Air Taxi Sequence"" which was completed and reincuperated into the film just for the DVD release.  The audio commentary track is genius, and even the menus are fun.  The second disc contains a wealth of bonus materials including more completed deleted sequences, a 66-minute new making-of doccumentary as well as five featurettes focusing on certian aspects of the film and the 12-part web doccumentary series that debuted on starwars.com during the movie's production.  Also included are trailers, TV spots, the ""Duel of the Fates"" music video, footage on the making of the popular videogame ""Star Wars: Starfighter,"" and more.  The only better DVD I've seen out there yet is ""Snow White"" from Disney.  This set will go a long way towards making it up to people who unlike me are a bit disappointed in the film.
A great film made even better by a great DVD set.  If this is any indication of what the original trilogy's DVDs will be like, they too will be amazing.  Great job, Lucasfilm!",1019520000,,2749,4.616803278688525

The whole point of this film was esentually to show how Anikin was admited to the Jedi order and would eventually be fated to bring down the galaxy.  The story is told almost in a child like way.  Though serious, it has a light-hearted nature at it's core that is almost like A NEW HOPE.

But it is not a out-and-out war film like the 3 original films.  No, this is a different genre altogether  -- politics.  It shows what would eventually lead to the Republic's fall.  The End of the Begining.  It's told with a light-heart  -- because it's all down hill from here.  Lucas clearly knew what he was doing.  The next 2 films clearly will get darker.

The 'force' was interesting as something mysterious but this movie knocked the foundation of my interest right out from under it.  This is a movie about Star Wars and some things need to exist without explanation.  Everyone in the SW universe grew up with that garbage as part of their fictional character's culture, so they do not need explanations of every little thing.  Besides, leaving some things unexplained lets the viewer fill in the gaps with their own imagination - as is the cast in the SW trilogy (before the special editing).
The story.  Yeah I'm not the first one to mention this, but you need more.  Darth Sidious' plot to come to power seems like a - ...I can't believe the cards are falling this way, I better cash in on this!' when it should show that he was behind the scenes in every little aspect.  That was a big dissapointment.  What is the deal with the 'chosen one' angle?  A setup for the obvious 'I don't need you/I'm better than you' conversion to the dark side that is sure to come?  In the movie, Anakin comes across as clumsily shooting a missle into the ship to destroy it from the inside out.  In the book, there was a little force action motivating him to do it.  I like the book better than the 'oops' feel that the movie gave.
My rants go on, but I'll just say that I'll probably read episode 2 and decide if I want to watch it.",1018828800,2,1557,4.364583333333333

The parallels between Luke and his father are so easy to see in this film. My only dissapointment in this film (aside from jar-jar) was the Jedi council.

Even more offensive is the Steppin'-Fetchit Jar-Jar Binks.  A character that is so annoying you hope that he gets killed off.  Soon.  Please.

660331,5,6303454038,"""A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...""  was the classic phrase used three times back in the late seventies to early eighties in an introduction to a phenomenon so great it shattered all box-office records in those days.  STAR WARS enlightened the many, young and old, geeky and non, etc, and George Lucas, the director, when he had completed the three part series, he hinted that he was planning on another STAR WARS project that would probably be introduced to the people when technology is at its best.
  Well, technology is DEFINITELY at its best now.  And when THE PHANTOM MENACE hit theaters on May 17, 1999, it was the loudest, biggest, baddest, and ultimate movie of the year.  It smashed ALL records, including its ancestor ""A New Hope"", but people left not satisfied, but as if they had just left from another mediocre film.
  I must admit though I enjoy STAR WARS, I felt that ""The Phantom Menace"" was not the best work that George had done.  Maybe he was beginning to get the hang of it again.  For all I know, he definitely took advantage of the special effects and the martial arts, but that was basically it.  Natalie Portman's acting was not as good as her usual, and Jar Jar Binks, well, I just wanted to attain a laser gun and shoot him.
  Well, two years passed, and now the film has been released on DVD, the first of the six movies to be remastered onto a disc.  And George MOST DEFINITELY took advantage of the DVD's capabilities, packing it full with up to 6 hours of behind-the-scenes footage, documentaries, and extras.  I just loved it, and, of course, I watched it for six hours straight.  This movie, though mediocre, was amazing on DVD, and I recommend it to all those who wish to come closer to the Force.
  Three years has passed, and now the sequel is on its way.

660332,3,6303454038,"...  There are few irrefutable facts to be listed in regards to
the release and reception of The Phantom Menace.  I'll limit myself
to the following:
  It made two truck loads of money.
  It permitted an onslaught of cynical marketing in its name.
  It failed to meet the expectations of its fans.
  As for the first item, raking in the cash is no big deal
these days; it reveals nothing either way about the quality of
the film involved.  As for the second, to have expected no marketing
campaign, or even a reasonable one, would have been presuming to
understand the incredibly complex, avaricious and unstoppable engine
of greed that powers the corporate multiplex of interconnected media.
It may or may not have been within George Lucas's ability to control;
at any rate, I honestly doubt that Lucas's primary intent in revisiting
his galaxy far, far away was to make sure that he had sixty katrillion
dollars instead of thirty.
  But on to more pressing matters.
  One's ability to enjoy 'Phantom Menace', I suppose, depends
greatly on how invested one was in the original trilogy.  For
someone like myself--white, early thirties--the investment is
considerable.  So, like many of my ilk, I do not like this film.
I don't like its cartoonishness.  I don't like how it plays fast
and loose with Star Wars icons.  I particularly don't like the
sloppy script.
  And, like just about everybody, casual fans included, I
hate the fact Lucas seems to have abandoned the character-based
formula that powered the original trilogy, opting instead for a
political/historical canvas of sorts.
  But I can also see things in this film that nobody, not even
its apologists, ever seems to mention.
  How about Lucas's technical virtuosity?  How about the film's
gentle good-nature?  (I'd give a big wad of cash to anyone who disproves
my theory that 'The Phantom Menace' is the only major American release
of the last twenty years to include not a single sarcastic moment or
line of dialogue.)  I seem to be the only person, fans of the film
included, who seems aware of, and grateful for, the deliberately
old-fashioned feel to this film.  (Perhaps one of the reasons that
popular bane, Jar Jar Binks, bothers me so little is that he's easier
to deal with if you've seen as many old westerns, B serials, and war
films as I have, each with their own similarly broad comic relief.)
  Much more distracting to me were the action sequences in the
film that were scuttled by inappropriate ""humor"" that had nothing
to do with Jar Jar.  The kid in the space battle going ""Waaaah!""
like Macauley Culkin, or the two headed announcer who absolutely
ruins the pod race.  Action scenes are the bread and butter of
Star Wars, and that sort of tinkering is unforgivable.
  It's maddening.  'The Phantom Menace' is a maddening movie,
a film of endlessly annoying details and flawed conceits built
upon an artful, learned, and heartfelt skeleton of ideas and
intentions.
  That seems to be my final verdict.
  As I write this, Episode II is only a few weeks from release.
I have no doubt that, like 'Phantom Menace', most of the movie-going
public will like it well enough, but not love it.  And, like any
number of Star Wars die-hards out there, I will love it at its
core . . .
  . . . and not like it much.

Return of the Jedi sees Lando attack yet another Death Star. This time flying into it and blowing it up. OK well see my review for that movie.

660334,4,6303454038,"I just watched the The Phantom Menace again on video, not having seen it since it was out in theaters, and had a few thoughts to share with my fellow Amazon.com customers.
- The first hour or so is WAY too fast-paced. I realize Lucas is making what is basically an action-adventure film here, and that he doesn't want to lose the attention of the adolescent and pre-adolescent males that are his target audience, but JEEZ! It's really hard to follow what's going on without liberal use of the ""Rewind"" button - an option I didn't have upon first viewing. It's also a shame in that Lucas has assembled such a fine cast (Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, etc.) and allows them so little breathing room.
- As a screenwriter, Lucas makes a wonderful director. Watching TPM, I was reminded of Harrison Ford's remark during the filming of the first SW film: ""George, you can type this stuff, but you sure as hell can't say it"". If I heard one more person shout ""Yippie!"", I was gonna strangle somebody.
- I noticed that the very last thing you hear on the soundtrack (at the end of the credits) is Darth Vader's breathing. Nice touch.
I WOULD recommend this to all my fellow SW fans out there, but y'all have probably seen it a couple dozen times anyway. Let me just say, then, that despite its flaws, TPM was still one of the best SF films of the 90s. I can't wait for the next two films to come out. Let's just hope Lucas slows things down a bit for them.",1018396800,,1445,4.37546468401487
660335,4,6303454038,"Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is definitely a movie worth seeing. It is somewhat superior to the original trilogy when it comes to the action. The Phantom Menace contains non-stop action that is very exciting to see. The plot is another story. When seeing this film, one finds it difficult to see where the plot is headed. That is because the plot of this movie is somewhat weak and undeveloped. (Thus the missing star). Also, the movie seems to be nothing more than a western story transplanted on other worlds. Personally, I think The Phantom Menace is more of an adventure movie than a science-fiction film, only with science-fiction elements added to the action, such as otherworldly planets, alien beings, and robots. Although the plot is weak it is still my opinion that The Phantom Menace is worth seeing, and what it lacks in plot development it makes up for with the action sequences, especially the nerve frazzling desert podrace and the thriller of a climax which is an intense laser sword duel. Other action-filled sequences such as the intense space battle, the riveting battle fought between an army of robots and an army of aliens, the sequence in which two Jedi Knights narrowly escape a death trap set for them on a space station, and the sequence in which the queen ruler of the besieged and invaded planet of Naboo escapes the dangerous planet along with the two Jedi Knights who resued her from imprisonment makes this a film not to be missed by any means. It is not neccessary for one to be a Star Wars fan in order to enjoy this film. In my opinion Jake Lloyd, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman display the best performances. Lloyd plays Anakin Skywalker, the nine year-old slave boy who is the future Darth Vader. Ewan McGregor plays the role of young Jedi Knight apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Natalie Portman plays Queen Amidala, ruler of planet Naboo.",1018310400,,1888,4.759146341463414

The acting is perfect, with the exception of Padme. I can't believe how stale she was! Lucas [did well] directing, but I say he shoud've used models like the Classics, but he used CGI!
I hope this movie is re-released in 17 years!",1017878400,,613,4.293103448275862

Will it bring world peace? Will it cure cancer? Well, sheesh. I left work early on opening day to catch a matinee at an out of the way theater. I was able to walk right in, see the movie, and then go about the rest of my life. I felt so sorry for those unfortunates who wasted so much time in anticipation for this poorly written, acted, and directed film. Yeah, a lot of things go boom! Neat. This was a film of no substance whatsoever. There was nothing of the fun, the mythos, the joy of the first film. What we got instead was a marketing ploy, nothing more. There ought to be a cosmic law in which Mr. Lucas would be obligated to pay back the time wasted by those who watched this drivel.",1017187200,9,867,4.166666666666667
660388,3,6303454038,"Star Wars was not put on the AFI's top 100 list because it looked good, had cool special effects, or exciting action sequences. It is there because it is a great film. The Phantom Menace is a typical 90's action/adventure heavy on Special Effects and light on substance. Obi Wan was in Star Wars less than half the movie, but I know more about him than I do about any character in Phantom Menace. Han Solo is a character everyone wants to be, or at least meet. Luke is a gape jawed simple farm boy who is thrust into the big bad world unprepared. Leia is the leader of a movement she knows is more important than herself, or indeed any one person.
The Phantom Menace has all the drama and intrigue of C-SPAN. ""The motion before the floor is, should we care about a war over trade on a planet no one cares about? The yeas are 192, the neas are 387, the measure does not pass....Next item of business..."" (Yawn!)
There was no character development, no internal conflicts, no hard decisions to make. In short it was a mindless romp through a story we all know the end to, full of pretty pictures and flashy sword fights. Check your brain at the door. We have special effects now, who needs a good story.",1017100800,2,1200,4.337777777777778
660389,4,6303454038,"Would anybody be totally happy with anything George Lucas came out with following the outrageous build-up for this film? Probably not, but one tends to think he could have done just a bit better than this. I know there are some ""Star"" fans who adore anything new about ""Star Wars"", and there were many who despised this film after only half the film. Granted, I hated Jar-Jar Binks, myself, thinking he was just too silly for words. But the film does have some really fine moments, and some greatness, too.
No matter what I thought of the film, however, I really have to take my hat off to Mr. Lucas for putting out such a high-quality DVD. The picture transfer is exceptional, the sound out-of-this-world, and enough extras to satisfy ANYBODY. All included, the film and extras take up two discs, with all sorts of behind the scenes stuff and commentary.
Really, only DVD does this film any kind of justice, because only here can one see all the background scenery in all its complex glory. One can watch this film many times and still see something new every time. What incredible detail.
Well, as I said, the film could have been better, but it does have its moments, and the DVD is one of the best ever produced, so indeed well-worth including in any DVD collection.",1016928000,,1270,4.599118942731278
660390,5,6303454038,"One of the biggest complaints against this movie has been its ""terrible script"" and predictable plot.  Because the other three Star Wars movies have been accepted into the canon of classic pictures, we have a tendency to judge this movie a little more harshly than we should.
The first three movies produced, in my opinion, were, at times, corny and predictable as well, but I still liked them a lot.  The music in this movie was amazing (I don't know where John Williams continues to get ideas from after all these years), the casting was excellent, and the story was somewhat intriguing.  I'm eagerly awaiting the releases of the next two, just to see how everything worked out between Episode I and Episode IV.
There was, however, one huge mistake in this movie: Jar Jar Binks.",1016841600,,780,4.720588235294118
660391,5,6303454038,"Ok, I've heard it all.  ""I hate Jar-Jar"", ""There's no acting!"", blah blah blah.
I was first introduced to Star Wars at the innocent age of three.  I saw Return of the Jedi in the theater and can only remember walking out of it after it was over.  I was three.  The magic of seeing that movie (and having a father who enjoyed the first three films) was that I can now say that i have seen the trilogy well over 300 times, each film.  Only because every time I watch these movies, I keep an open mind and view them as if I was three years old again, the only benefit to being older is that I can actually understand what Yoda means when he talks about the force.
This is exactly the same attitude I took in with me when I entered that theater to watch the latest offering from Lucas and Company.  And I loved every minute of it.  Did I complain about the acting?  No.  Why?  Because it's Star Wars, I'm not saying the acting was bad ever, but watch all four again, you'll see similarities in ALL of the acting.
Does Jar Jar suck?  Of course he does, but I'm too mezmerized, by the dark side of the force and one of the coolest lightsaber battles I have ever seen, to notice.
The quality of the Phantom Menace is something that has only been surpassed by the first three Star Wars films and the Matrix.  I've never seen anything that can do better, even with all of its apparent flaws, my heart still races when Obi-Wan busts out his lightsaber with ferocious malaise to avenge the death of his master.  And I've seen it over 100 times, 15 or so in the theater.
The DVD makes it even better!  The inclusion of the extra scenes, the hour and a half long documentary about just making the movie.  And it's not one of those documentaries where they explain the film.  Its literally a camera on the sidelines while they're making the film!  Fantastic.  Oh and the blooper reel had me rolling for about 5 minutes after I saw what pickup that jawa sandcrawler actually had!
All I can say is I've seen the latest trailer for Attack of the Clones and I'm going to be waiting patiently for the next 8 weeks.  Because once that movie is released, all of the people who have spoken badly about Episode I will be suddenly silenced.",1016755200,,2216,4.270983213429257
660392,2,6303454038,"My all time favorite movies would probably be the First Star Wars Trilogy Installments and the Toy Story movies?  Why?  Because I have a thing for intergalactic dogma and the notion that the toys I used to play with talk behind my back and grapple with the same emotions I do?  No, because the accessibility of these films are unbelieveable.  Anybody with a brain can enjoy these films.  They entertain children without coming off as idiotic to adults.  So, how does Episode I fit into the subject?
The movie doesn't know what audience it wants to pander to, and maybe Lucasfilm didn't care to decide because they knew people would see just about anything that had the words ""Star"" and ""Wars"" in close proximity.  Too bad, because the only people that I think would get a real kick out of the topical nature of the film's plot, characters, and lines that at best were flat and at worst made me cringe would be kids!  And there's nothing wrong with that, except that I thought that Star Wars was a FAMILY movie.  When Qui-Gon Jinn knocks out Jar Jar Binks to calm him down, only kids laugh;  everyone else cries tears of joy because he finally shut up.  There are only a few and far between moments in the movie where the entire audience extrapolates the same emotion from a scene (Anakin's heartrending departure from Tatooine is a popluarly cited example).  I was thouroughly disappointed.  As for the DVD extras, who cares?  The extras should complement what the main course is;  here, it's like an M&M that's no chocolate and all colorful candy shell...",1016496000,3,1556,4.648351648351649
660393,3,6303454038,"... about this movie. I have seen the original trilogy more than 15 times and this movie 3 times so far, yet I cannot decide whether I liked it or was disappointed in it.
First of all, I'm from that gang who didn't like Jar Jar (let's not use strong words here and let's not be impolite, but I DIDN'T like him). He is the equivalent of the funny characters in cartoons -- to me he was annoying and got way too much screen time.
Second, I didn't like Jake Lloyd. He didn't act, period. There are so many child actors out there who are good, like that one in The Sixth Sense or the one in Harry Potter (sorry, I'm not very good with names). Those two would probably have been too old for the part, but there must be others!!
Well, if you got this far, you are interested in what I have to say... I don't know WHAT I was expecting of this movie and what it should have been in order to attract and awe me like the original trilogy has. And if even I don't know, how could I ask Lucas to know?! But something was definitely missing and wrong - apart from Anakin and Jar Jar, that is. Perhaps it's the magic that a childhood fairytale has and that at a certain age you aren't able to sense anymore. Perhaps it's just Han. I don't know. I watched the movie intently everytime but it simply doesn't catch me like the old ones have. I don't get the thrills I got every time I watched those. I am unable to identify with any of the characters and care for them. I hoped, feared and rejoiced alongside Han, Luke and Leia everytime, but Obi Wan and Qui-Gon just leave me cold like I was watching some strangers.
The special effects are good, we all agree about that, but perhaps they were overused... like many reviewers have said, Lucas paid more attention to them than to the story.
And what about Darth Maul? (Yes, it's MAUL, not MALL or MAUI or whatever... Amazon.com should really check those spellings). He wears that ridiculous painting on his face and he's supposed to be the villain? My oh my... Now Palpatine/Sidious, THAT was a great villain...
Anyway, like (almost) everybody out there I hope that Episode II will be better...",1016496000,3,2127,4.32

This is actually quite a good movie, maybe not as good as the originals but it had everything that makes a good Star Wars movie, the villain, the good-guys, the comic relief[okay maybe Jar Jar let this one down]. Also some great visuals and some super cool battles. The podrace is a real blood fueler i might add.",1016236800,,407,4.589041095890411
660464,5,6303454038,"This movie suffers from mixed reviews.  People Love it or Hate it (on the net, anyways.  Most folks I know in the real world think it's a fine addition to the Star Wars universe).  No denying that or the fact that one side probably will never change how the other side feels about it.  I myself, I love it. It's not as good as the original Star Wars or Empire Strikes Back, but it's on par with Return of the Jedi, which still puts it in my top 4 all time favorite flicks :)
The biggest problem I have with it is the Gungan/Battle Droid battle.  It's just a little too video game looking there.  Other than that, the FX were amazing.  Liam Neeson totally embodies the status of Jedi Master.  Jar Jar may be annoying, but his presense is not ruinous to the movie.  I could go on and on, but there's no need.  Everyone has an opinion on the movie, and now you know mine.  Let's talk DVD.
Everyone raves about ""The Beginning"" documentary, and it deserves it.  But I couldn't help but think I could easily watch another hour or two of it.  As imformative as it is, it still seems only the tip of the iceberg for the making of the movie. The web docos were all nice, I enjoyed each and every one.  Lot of info in those few minutes.  I liked the deleted scenes, but I know there are more out there, so come on George, cough 'em up!  It was also nice to see the previews and trailers again.  They are well put together and still get the anticipation pumping to see the movie even after watching it numerous times.  Also a very imformative commentary from George and the Team at the Ranch.
This is a well stocked DVD and worth the wait.  It's saying something when the movie's detractors are raving over the DVD, but as a big fan of the flick, it's simply over the top.  Well done, George, my man, and bring on the Clones!",1016150400,,1814,4.202898550724638

The first disappointing thing that comes to mind is the acting. Most of it was very good, but every time I think of the movie, the first thing that comes is, ""He did it. The little guy did it."" (And those of you who seen the movie know what I am talking about.) There was hardly any emotion.  You might have thought a dog jumped through a firey hoop at the circus.  By the way the pilot was reacting as their ship was going down, the viewer hardly seemed to care if R2-D2 was able to fix the stupid thing. As a matter of fact, I almost did not want him to. That would be one less terrible actor in the movie. The second thing that comes to mind is the two-headed pod-racing commentator that looked like two different races of creatures stuck together. That was extremely annoying. But if you like special effects, this movie has awesome special effects and a very good ending.
One thing that made Star Wars very popular was Darth Vader...",1016064000,,1062,4.331658291457287
660466,4,6303454038,"This dvd is packed with good extras and stuff like that, the usual making of the movie aswell as some special DVD ROM content.
The movie is not as good though.  Its definetely aimed at younger audience and it takes some steps out of the usual star wars style (why does Anakin call his mother ""mom""?  And why do they call him Ani?!  Thats just not Star Wars!).  The ""comic relief"" was a bit too much.  Jar Jar was annoying as hell and probably did nothing but drag this movie right to the level of that ET atari game (you know the one that sold absolutely no copys and even bums wouldnt accept free cartriges?  And then after they tried doing that they had to put every copy in some landfill in Mexico?)  Uh, well anyway, at least hes not going to make a huge appearance in Episode II!
If Phantom menace stays true to something of the star wars legend its the figthing.  The lightsaber battles were awesome, as always and I'm looking forward to seeing Episode II (even more so after seeing the new ""Clone Wars"" trailer).  For star wars fans this DVD is a must buy.  For general movie watchers you might want to think a little bit before purchasing the dvd.  I still recommend it, because Star Wars no matter what, is a classic.",1016064000,2,1226,4.333333333333333

definatly the best star wars made",1016064000,2,60,5.1
660468,5,6303454038,"Yes, this is a very good movie.  I am continually amazed at the amount of criticism that is dished out at George Lucas and Episode 1.  The core group of fans consists of a twenty-something crowd that grew up with these movies.  They were a part of our young lives and the effect they had on pop culture simply can't be measured.  So, George Lucas is faced with making these prequels under the pressure of ""hey George, make me feel like a kid again.""  It is simply impossible to settle everyone's demands of what these prequels should look and feel like.  After 22 years, it is natural for us to have our own views of what this ""beginning"" should look like.  You have to take into account that we know how the stories ultimately end.  These prequels are a means to that end.  SW1 was a very well-done movie that will come under more scrutiny than any film in recent memory.
George Lucas does spend a lot of time on the fx in the movie.  He is also the Godfather of Sci-fi special effects.  He is the pioneer of the craft.  In 1977, no one thought anything like that could be done and look even somewhat realistic.  So - again - I think people spend too much energy saying what looks too ""CG"" or not real enough.  It's a fantasy environment!  Look at Yoda in the movie.  He looks like a puppet from K-mart.  That's how far the technology has come.  In 1980 Yoda was a marvel of creature creation.  Now, things are going to be computer generated (note that Yoda is completely CG in ep. 2) to make the film seem more other-worldly.  Whenever someone presents something brand new - it comes under fire and the next guy down the street will top it.  Still - Lucas takes too much heat for his interest in creating a realistic environment.
Lucas also answers fan demand.  It's no coincidence that Boba Fett and Jango Fett are in Ep. 2.  He knows they are the characters we want to see - and there they are. Lucas just can't answer every fan's demands.
Ragging on Star Wars 1 is something that is currently en vogue.  I expect Ep. 2 to come under the same scrutiny.  However, just try to sit back and enjoy the movie!",1016064000,2,2108,4.316326530612245

Speaking of which he is the only character that i would care to learn more about.  Obi-wans okay, but to jaded to be so young.
fortunately the final lightsaber battle rocks. however, it is short and lacks the whole feel of luke Vs. vader.

660470,2,6303454038,"I know that's a tag line from Reboot not Star Wars but it fits sooo well. My first rational reaction to this was ""It took Lucus 16 years to write this mess?!"" It is pretty, I'll give it that much. The special effects are gorgeous and so is Ewen McGregor. That's not enough. This film has serious plot problems. Too many to go into here. In addition I felt that long sections of the movie were just commercials for the tie in products. The pod race is the prime example of this. You just knew there would be a pod racer toy and video game. Sure enough there were. The character of Jar Jar is so offensive that there are actually people out there offering bootleg tapes with the promise that most of his scenes have been edited out. Not since Barney has there been a character that is so hated.  If you really feel you must spend money on this (I wish I hadn't)then by all means get the DVD. The special effects will look better and it will be easier to skip the really bad stuff than it is with video. OR better yet get the Weird Al Yankavic Live DVD where he does ""The Saga Begins"" His retelling of the story set to ""The day the music died.""

A little Jar Jar Binks goes a long way, and I understand the need for comic relief and the attempt to amuse the kids, so I wasn't overly bothered by him.  Some restraint was needed, however, and that wasn't there.  And in the extra material on the DVD it is sooooooo apparent George Lucas picked the WRONG KID.  He must have fancied himself such a ""Great Director"" that he could make Jake Lloyd look like a junior Jack Nicholson.  George Lucas does technical/visual stuff very well (""we'll fix it in post""), but he is not artistic enough to get heart and soul performances out of his actors -- who of course play second fiddle to the effects.  He tends to stunt an actor's creativity.  That's common knowledge.  But from what I hear, G.L. learned from his mistakes and redeems himself in ""Attack of the Clones"" to a great extent.

It is a very well organized disc, very easy to navigate and full of interesting goodies.
In the Making Of you can see George Lucas in action during various crucial moments of the movie's filming and producing, including casting, editing, plus inside videos of various crew and cast members.  It turns out to be highly educational for movie fans.

They had potential but ultimately Lucas didn't expand the Star Wars Universe to satisfy people who want some depth in their movie experience.
So what's his excuse now? Rather than grow up with his audience and create a prequel that would stimulate some brain cells he simply created a movie as an excuse to sell more toys. I mean come on, doesn't he have enough money to get some real writers and pay for some special effects that don't look like special effects?
When I saw all the Star Wars fans getting so excited over the coming of this movie, (many of them going so far as to actually buy tickets for Meet Joe Black just to see the coming attractions for the Phantom Menace and then walk out) I was almost certain that Lucas wouldn't let them down.

These films struck a bland, austere, and matriarchal note which cuts all the way through these diverse and exciting environments. It could've been a great adventure, but it splits its story over too many supporting characters, none of which add or build on anything, because Lucas is not a writer. I think these films reemphasize the importance of screenwriters in this industry. Go back and compare it to 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK'.

Star Systems are severing ties to the Republic in what will form the Empire... there's some mystery the Jedi need to go to Naboo to warn the Queen of, and she meets her future husband... that's all that's going on here. The tone varies so much because it doesn't know when to be exciting/thoughtful/foreboding, so we have ROLES instead of CHARACTERS --like Jar-Jar, the walking doll. We spend so much time with CGI, creatures, and a whining blond boy, that all of the important things are sucked right out of it.

the actors  can't act ,very bland.the only thing good are the special effects but that alone does not bring a movie to greatness.i expected lucas to have some respect towards the old generation of fans which brougth him were he is in the first place but he failed dearly.hes next project should be at least better then the toddler movie he gave us 2 years ago and if its a dude i won't feel sorry for him.",1015459200,2,1285,4.309917355371901

I can't say too much that hasn't already been said by many others.  I wish Obi Wan had been the focus of the story, or it might have been interesting if Queen Amidala had been the focus.  What I think the movie is really lacking is a hero the audience can identify with.  Qui-Gon doesn't work as a focal point, because he never really has to face any particular challenges.  It really should have focused on Obi Wan.  Anakin doesn't work as a focus either, because every already knows what becomes of him.  Maybe it would have been interesting if George Lucas had come up with a completely new story set in a totally different time period.  He still could of used the same cast.  I was excited when I first heard of the main cast members, I like Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Liam Neeson, but unfortunately they weren't given anything very interesting to do.  The DVD package however is excellent.  The one hour documentary is one of the best (if not the best) I have ever seen on a DVD.  Besides the main documentary there is a deleted scenes documentary that is very good and a series of short documentaries originally produced for the web.

Was George Lucas so intent on getting the newest special effects right that he forgot about the characters that we all want to get to know and love?  Liam Neeson was so boring, his performance so flat that I had to wonder if he was mad because his character dies in the movie and he just read his lines and showed up on the set when required.  George, George, you can do better!  Even the kid's haircut was so cereal bowl-typical Hollywood... yea, the kid was an okay actor, but that was it!  None of the other actors are worthy of mentioning.  Perhaps it wasn't their fault, perhaps if they'd had better supporting actors around them they would have had a little more personality or spark.  My husband and I liked the ""how they made the movie"" segment better than the film itself.  PLEASE!  Make this one up to us Star Wars fans!!

660604,5,6303454038,"...I'll admit: ""The Phantom Menace"" wasn't the greatest Star Wars movie ever made...but it wasn't horrible! And yes, I hated Jar Jar Binks like most of you but I didn't hold that one character against my feelings toward this movie. And of course this is not like the old Star Wars trilogy--that trilogy was Luke Skywalker's story. Now we are onto the trilogy which gives us Anakin Skywalker's story on why and how he becomes Darth Vader. I mean, after all, he wasn't BORN Darth Vader! It was sort of unfair that ""The Phantom Menace"" received an overwhelmingly ancticipation of media hype so of course it could not live up to everyone's expectations (we all had different expectations, I'm sure). But it did satisfy me, which is a good thing because I am a big Star Wars fan. Of course I loved the old trilogy but I'm also learning to love and appreciate the new trilogy, unlike some stubborn Star Wars fans.
The action sequences were awesome...and even the acting was pretty good. The dialouge and plot were okay, but who sees Star Wars for the dialouge?! Yes, the robots and animated characters/scenes were a little cheesy but I'm sure Lucasfilm did their best. I rate this movie 4/5 stars and the DVD a solid 5.
This DVD is one of the best DVDs ever with over 600 hours of ""The Making of 'The Phantom Menace'"", documentaries made by George Lucas, featurettes, CD-ROM extras, Web documentaries, and tons more! It also includes the original ""Phantom Menace"" trailer, and picture-perfect sound and quality.

George seems to have lost all touch with his fans and what it takes to tell a good story. This film  could not have possibly been test screened. While this movie is stocked with great actors, their performances were wooden. Scenes were flat. Characters had no chemstry. Lucas definately seemed more concerned with the fx in the background than what was going on with the main characters. I really disliked the heavy digital look, especially during the final battle. TPM is not a movie, but more like a 2 hour video game. The script was horrible and the movie moved at a slow pace. After the criticism that the cutsie Ewoks drew, I can not belive that he gave so much attention to Jar Jar, who made people in the theater shift uncomfortably in their chairs. Darth Maul was the coolest thing about the movie and he only got about five minuites time. The absolute worst thing about this movie is the introduction of the midocloreans. I have always thought that the force was a spiritul power, not due to a bunch of bacteria. This not only ruins this movie, but the original trilogy. I felt this movie was an insult to most people's intelligence. It was written for kids, but I did not see many kids enjoying this movie. I could go on and on, but I will not. This movie's flaws are pretty evident. There is a big backlash against Star Wars and deservingly so. George is greedy. Where is Episode 4-6 on DVD IN ORIGINAL FORM. Where is Raiders on DVD. Attack of the Clones will be out in a few months, and by looking at the trailers i feel that we are in for more bad scripts and wooden acting.

There are several extended scenes completed just for the DVD, a plethora of promotional material, and reference quality sound, but the crown jewel of this package is the behind the scenes documentary.

660686,4,6303454038,"I'm still amazed by all the bad press that this movie receives. For anyone who loved the original trilogy, there is no way that you will not enjoy this film.
  Granted, the film doen't measure up to A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back, but it is certainly enjoyable, and in my mind, superior to Return of the Jedi. The main problem with the film is Jar Jar. He is more annoying than the Ewoks in ROTJ, and lacks the intrigue of Chewbacca. But honestly, from the pod race scene on, he becomes a background character. Sure, he still plays a role in the end battle scene, but you don't really mind him here, as the action and special effects overshadow his annoying voice and clumsiness.
  Another major complaint is young Anakin, played by Jake Lloyd. Give me a break, people! He's supposed to be a cute, innocent child who loves and misses his mom - and he plays this role convincingly.
  Lastly, people complain about the droids. Sure, they lack the ""coolness"" of stormtroopers, but let's remember, this takes place quite a few years before ANH. It's fun looking at the droids, the ships, and yes, the whole Trade Federation plot, and seeing how all these things evolved and influenced the universe as we're used to seeing it in the other films.
  As for the dvd, the special features alone are worth the cost. It is currently the best made, fully-packed dvd on the market.
  Give the movie a chance, and see it for what it is - the start of the greatest science fiction story ever told. Give Mr. Lucas a break, and judge the saga as a whole. I guarantee, he knows what he's doing, and when it's all said and done with, he will not disappoint!",1013558400,,1645,4.4352159468438535

Both are mere shadows of what they could have been had more attention been devoted to the crafting and telling of the story and less concern been devoted to making easy to digest summer blockbusters.
By any real standard, ""The Phantom Menace"" doesn't belong as a part of the Star Wars family of movies.  The choice of actors is off the mark.  The fight scenes and action sequences are not nearly as thoughtfully staged as they were in the original trilogy.  And worst of all, the storytelling is flat.  Keen storytelling with good special effects trumps a thin story and excellent special effects every time.  The latter is what makes a summer blockbuster.  The former is what makes a classic.  My hope is that Lucas will invest more time into refining the storytelling in Episode II and obsess less over the CGI and pyrotechnics.
On a similar note, less of the hyperactive shifting back and forth between action scenes and smoothing out the editing and letting the scenes evolve a bit more slowly would also be improvements that would serve Episode II well.  But that may not be much of a consideration or possibility in light of how much the average attention span in our society has shrunk in the 25 or so years since the first Star Wars.

660690,4,6303454038,"Writer/director/producer George Lucas' long awaited prequel to his blockbuster sci-fi saga is a flawed but fun family film. Set three decades before the original ""Star Wars"", ""The Phantom Menace"" has the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) coming to the aid of the teenaged Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) when her planet is invaded by the greedy alien Trade Federation's robot army. While fleeing from the bad guys, our heroes meet friendly nine year old slave Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a boy who may be the Chosen One of Jedi prophecy, although we know he'll grow up to become the villainous Darth Vader instead. Complicating the plot is that the Trade Federation is a pawn in the evil Sith Lords Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid) and Darth Maul's (Ray Park) unfolding scheme to gain control of the Galactic Republic and destroy the Jedi Knights. Old favorites like R2-D2, C-3PO, Yoda, and Jabba the Hutt also have small roles, and we meet new all-CGI characters like Jar Jar Binks, a clumsy, cartoonish amphibian alien whose goofy antics and pidgin English dialogue is at first annoying, but grows on you. ""The Phantom Menace"" actually surpasses the original ""Star Wars"" when it comes to special effects, production design, and epic scope. ILM has effectively blended live action with computer animation to create believable alien worlds, the intense light sabre battles make the old fights look like child's play, and the plot's political machinations are surprisingly complex. However the acting is mixed, the dialogue is occasionally cheesey, there is too much slapstick and not enough true wit, and the characters lack the appealing dynamics of the original films. You also have to be very familiar with the ""Star Wars"" universe to keep track of where the story is going.",1013212800,,1832,5.11
660691,5,6303454038,"After 16 years of waiting impatiently, George Lucas finally releases the forth Star Wars film which is actually the first Episode of a six part story. The original Star Wars film was Episode Four, Empire: Episode Five and Jedi: Episode Six which concludes the epic saga.
The hype prior to release of the Phantom Menace was bigger than the Death Star and significantly, bigger than Marlon Brando. It was ridiculously hyped beyond belief and only the media was to blame. LFL actually asked for the hype to be contained, but by that time it had gotten out of control.
Those of you who bought into that hype and were seriously let down by the film are brainwashed, weak-minded fools who will only like something when it is in vogue.
Phantom Menace was getting embarrassingly poor reviews even before it's release. Which is hardly fair to any film.
Even as the poor reviews came flooding out, Phantom Menace was making a killing at the box office. It has held its place as the second highest grossing film at the global box office underneath James Cameron's blockbuster, Titanic.
The Film;
The movie failed to meet expectations of the fans because they were expecting to see the excitement and enthusiasm of the original trilogy. There were complaints by some who wanted a ""Han Solo"" type character. Why would you want that when Han appears in the last three films? Other complaints were things like ""Why are the two Jedi acting so wooden"". Well one of the most important Jedi traits is to show NO EMOTION. But I guess an epic scope storyline like this one is way above and beyond that of the armchair critics of our ""seen it all before and can't impress me"" world.
If this film was released in 1977 instead of the original, people would have accepted it more openly. But the sad fact is now that the people consider Star Wars as their own. Just because the audience of 1977 grew up it does not mean that the films also have to grow up as well. If they did would they fit in with the old series and come together as one 12 hour movie? I don't think so.
 Lucas himself said way before this movie was released that ""The first one starts off very slow, it's a very innocent kind of film. As the series progresses it gets darker and finally we will see how and why he (Anakin Skywalker) gets into the mask and becomes Darth Vader""
That statement was the key to understanding how the first episode was going to be played out.
Nothing much really happens in this film. It merely sets up the next two and does it beautifully.
We get to see a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) meet for the first time. It also introduces Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman), the mother of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa.
We also get to see a younger Palpatine (Ian Mcdiarmid) as a Senator on the magnificent planet capital, Coruscant. His political machinations seem to have gone unnoticed by so many. Palpatine who is the Senator of Naboo is also the sith lord, Darth Sidious. As Sidious, he uses the hugely rich and resourceful Trade Federation to blockade his own planet. As Palpatine he uses Amidala, Queen of Naboo to further his own political ambitions, which by the end of the film he has succeeded in.
A glorious spectacle epic in scope, which has been unsurpassed by no other film. Phantom Menace is beautifully designed with spectacular results. It serves as an appetiser for the upcoming sequels and has secured its place in film history.
Hollywood seems to be scared of Lucas. After all, he's the most successful independant filmmaker today. He seems to have a bad reputation just because he is a sucsess story and he accomplished it all on his own terms.
They told him it couldn't be done way back in the 70s. They are still telling him the same thing today. Wake up Hollywood, Lucas' way is the way of the future.",1013040000,4,3830,4.5830903790087465

Secondly, for Liam Neeson's part in general.  He did the part of the wise and kindly Jedi master Qui-gon Jinn, whose apprentice was Obi-wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and who sensed the power behind innocent Anakin Skywalker's (Jake Lloyd) appearance.

Star Wars 1 is a beautifully made film. The sets, the effects the photography are all brilliant. The problem is the plot and execution.
Jar Jar Binks is one of the most annoying characters to enter the film world. Black market copies of this film are being sold now with him being digitally removed from every scene.
The notion that a 15 year old girl could be elected to run a planet is also a fantasy which is clearly designed to make the film appeal to a younger target group. In much the same way the development of the Anakin Skywaler character is again aimed at the youth market. However in reality would some adults allow a 10 year old to engage in a dangerous car race to enable them to get some money to buy an engine? There are some plot points which are so unrealistic that they grate.
The forces of evil in this film use robots to fight for them. These robots are incredibly bad shots who never seem to hit anything. Clearly the main thrust of the film is to provide an explanation for the emergence of autocratic rule in the Star Wars universe.

660821,2,6303454038,"George Lucas wrote and directed the very funny 'American Graffiti' and the very imaginative 'Star Wars'. So what happend, George. What happened to 'Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace'??? The reason I bring this ancient movie (1999) up now is because Lucas' new film, 'Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones' is arriving in theaters in May of this year. I have a feeling this next film will be better than the last. I hope to GOD it is for everyone's sake. It really IS a good series (all except for the last atrocity - I give it two stars for its special effects and Ewan McGregor). There was a rumor going around: some of the actors, especially star Liam Neeson, noticed that Lucas was more interested in the technical aspects of the film rather than the actors. No wonder the acting was so wooden. Neeson, Natalie Portman (most of the time) and the boy (the one who played 'Anakin Walker - the future 'Darth Vader' - give me a break) all came across as wooden heads, and the boy is especially bad. Sorry. Sorry. I shouldn't blame the boy. I blame Lucas for not working with this kid, and for allowing such brilliant actors as Neeson to stroll through the role like the lobotomized Jedi Knight he was. McGregor at least 'tried' to add something extra, but when you have a director (Lucas again) who cares absolutely nothing for the actor, the script, the story, etc., 'The Phantom Menace' is bound to become not only one of the worst movies in 1999, but one of the worst science fiction movies I have ever seen. I have read some reviews commenting on the red-faced Darth Maul. What a clown. He was one millionth what Darth Vader (James Earl Jones - remember him???) was. Maybe Lucas shouldn't direct these movies. Like in 'The Empire Strikes Back' (easily the best of the films) and 'Return of the Jedi', Lucas hired others. Maybe he has lost 'touch' with humanity. Maybe he himself, like his numbing creation 'Jar Jar Binks', has also turned into some kind of dull alien whose only interests lie in boring audiences with the latest in super-technology. I know at one time Steven Spielberg had expressed interest in directing one of them. Maybe Lucas should remain 'behind the scenes' (and I do mean WAY behind the scenes). The real talent is always in the writers (good writers, George), the actors, and the hundreds of craftsmen who put together such an eventful science fiction film. Sooooooo, 'Phantom Menace' was a real dud. Will I see the next film??? Even though I am not happy with the title 'Attack of the Clones'???. Another hour and they have come up with a MUCH better title, guarenteed. But remember this, Lucas doesn't care about titles or scripts or actors - afterall he is truly a cyborg with no emotions, something his fans didn't know I bet. Still, I look forward to watching the 'newer' Star Wars saga. It features actors like Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor (I loved him in 'Moulin Rouge' - you should see that if you haven't already), Samuel L. Jackson and Christopher Lee (I LOVE Mr. Lee). I also heard that Hayden Christensen is a HUGE improvement over that 'kid' (I don't blame the kid - I blame the director). And the special effects should be masterful no doubt (afterall, Lucas OWNS ILM up north). 'Attack of the Clones' (WHAT a title), I can only wish upon a midnight star, will be a VAST improvement over the disappointing 'Phantom Menace' which took the series to an all-time low. Please, George Lucas, move to the planet Endor or at least wake up and smell the Wookies. A meaningful story, good writing, attention to the actors is what makes a film GREAT. The special effects can only enhance a film's quality, and we know Lucas is an expert at F/X. Well, I am crossing my fingers that May's 'Attack of the Clones' is indeed memorable and falls into line with 'The Empire Strikes Back'.

It seems unrealistic that he could turn out to be Darth Vader. Jar Jar Binks seemed to ruin the the whole serious mood of all the previous Star Wars films. Also, all of the pre-hype on Samual L.

660826,2,6303454038,"I mean it.  My first response to Episode 1 was the same resounding disappointment that was felt and expressed by many other movie viewers who hoped for and expected a progression in a style more fitting with the traditional Star Wars mythology.  This just wasn't it.  This was a phenomenal dose of glitz, far more than would have been neccessary, or even fitting, to really please those who have high appreciation for the trilogy.
However, I highly doubt that Lucas was even thinking of this category of moviegoers through the creation of this film.  In fact, I really hope he wasn't, because there is such a seemingly enormous break with tradition here, that the rift seems to be precisely the point.
Though I did not see the movie in the company of any children, I am quite sure that this category of moviegoers were absolutely delighted with the movie (and perhaps the very people Lucan had in mind in the movies creation).  In fact, if I had a child, I would rent this movie in a heartbeat for them to have fun watching.  I'm sure they would. Somehow, it is in thought of the children, that I give two stars, and not one.  (or none)
For those who are keen on the trilogy, well, I just might even buy the movie for them, partly as a prank, and partly to fire up their creative analytical capacity to further explore how the movie veered or kept in sync with the style of the trilogy.
My instinct, upon first viewing, was that it was completely out of sync with anything associated with what was previously known as Star Wars.  And I was agitated by it.  Frustrated.  I noticed however, that the person I had gone to see the movie with, my father, quite enjoyed the film.  And I realized that he, like many others who enjoyed the trilogy, but are not attached to its atmosphere and style, were precisely the folks, along with children, who may have had the most enjoyable viewing experience.
It's interesting to think that a whole new breed of ""Star Wars"" interest has perhaps been born with this film.  It has been born amidst the camp of moviegoers for whom this might have been their first Star Wars film (as in 6, 7, 8 year olds).  Frightening?  Perhaps.  Interesting? Definitely. What will they think when the see the triolgy, after having been introduced to the Star Wars myth through Episode 1? (!?!)
I would watch this movie again, as in a second time, for the same reason that I would give it to a fellow fan of the star wars myth.  Simply to hone my analysis of how the creation and display of this epic veered in this particular path and to see if there exist any possible clues as to why Lucas decided to take this drastic, drastic shift.
On a concluding note, I simply missed the architecture and emotion of the trilogy.",1011225600,,2735,4.483870967741935
660827,3,6303454038,"I can't say I hated EVERY minute of it.  I thought the podrace was exciting and well done -- I liked the underwater-with-giant-beasts sequence -- Queen Amidala's outfits were very cool -- I enjoyed the two-on-one lightsaber duel at the end.  The sprawling land battle scene between the droids and the Gunguns was very cool visually.  Ootah Gunga, the underwater city of the Gungans, was freaking gorgeous! as were almost all of the locales -- Theed (Naboo's capital city), the Jedi Council chambers, etc.)
 Things I disliked about Phantom Menace:
 1.) Jar Jar Binks (though I didn't hate him as much as other people did) His voice/language were very grating.  The fact that Lucas felt it at all necessary to include something so goofball gets to me.
 2.) I know for a fact that several members of the cast are incredible actors; I've seen them in other films.  Yet they are SOOO wooden in Ep. 1.  I have to assume it's Lucas's fault.  He's become so enamored with his super-advanced non-linear editing system where he can digitally combine Take 7 of Liam Neeson with Take 13 of Ewan McGregor.  So in love with the fact that he can just put his actors in front of a bluescreen.  I feel he is robbing any and all spontaneity from the performances of his actors.  There's no rhythm to their conversations.
 3.) The boy playing Anakin (Jake Lloyd) was awful. But I can't help but wonder if he's victim to the problem noted above.
 4.) What the @#$& is up with the Star-Trek-scan-for-lifeforms-in-his-blood-sample explanation of The Force?!?!?  And the whole immaculate conception thing?  Was any of that baloney necessary?  I (and probably just about everyone else in the world) was perfectly content to have The Force be an ambiguous something that even a master like Yoda could only explain with poetry and vague-isms.  I didn't see Yoda greet Luke's arrival on Dagobah and request for training by whipping out a handy dandy Lil' Jedi's First Aid Kit.
 5.) The dogfight against the droid ships/mother ship was a joke.  Not developed at all - no pacing, no one we cared about (except Anakin and that's debatable), no sense of what their objective was.  The best dogfight was in Star Wars. Excellently paced, different people taking their shot at the trench, the emotional resonance of Biggs's death, etc.  Even Return of the Jedi's dogfight had these elements, especially the sudden realization that the death Star was ""fully operational"" and then started blowing the big ships out of the ""sky"", will the Falcon be destroyed, if they DO succeed in destroying DSII Luke is dead, etc.  I just didn't care about the Ep. 1 dogfight.
 Now don't get me wrong, I wouldn't have wanted to be in George Lucas's shoes by any stretch of the imagination.  Fan expectation was immeasurably high.  High to the point that I believe it would have been almost impossible to please them (us).  But, that said, I think that removed from the excitement of seeing a new Star Wars movie, after fiercely clinging to a hope and prayer that this movie would be worthy of the Star Wars legacy, that after the incredible eye candy that a legion of production artists, animators, digital montage specialists, costume designers, etc. has faded from your retina, you are left with a slow paced, poorly acted film populated by characters we barely care about which dismantles beloved aspects of the original trilogy.
 I still pop Ep. 1 into my DVD player from time to time but it is never to watch the movie.  I do it to watch one of the ""making of"" documentaries or to watch the podrace sequence or to freeze frame one of the gorgeous digital compositions.  That to me is a sad, sad fact.",1011139200,7,3654,4.725118483412322

Now it's been said that Lucas intentioanlly made the first film a light one, in anticipation of the much more darker films to follow.  That's fine with me, but the problems still continue to leap out at me evry time I watch it.  It's clear Darth Maul is a professional swordsman (which is why he has little dialogue), unfortunatly it becomes all to clear in the fight scenes that this guy could easily take out our heroes in about 3 seconds.

660900,5,6303454038,"I was a kid when the first Star Wars movies were released. I have been a fan of the movies ever since. When the first prequel came out, I had the joy of taking my young daughter to see it. With all the talk of its not being as good as the first three, I was apprehensive. My fears were unfounded. Episode One, ""The Phantom Menace"" is (for right now at least) by far my favorite Star Wars movie.
The story begins before the coming of the Empire. The Republic is still around, as are the Jedi and their temple. Looking into the world of Star Wars before the time of Vader and the Emperor was half the joy of this film for me. The viewer is introduced to all kinds of new alien races and creatures. We get to see two new worlds (Naboo and Coruscant).
The story centers on a young Obi-Wan (still an apprentice) and his master Qui-Gon Jinn. Together they get involved in a planetary conflict and stumble upon the boy who will one day become Darth Vader.
The casting and acting are quite admirable. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are outstanding as Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon. Frank Oz as usual, is awesome as Yoda. While one can see how the guileless Jar Jar might have rubbed some the wrong way in the midst of the cynical last days of the twentieth century, the very concept of a computer generated character opens all kinds of interesting doors. Finally (as far as acting goes), I'd take Natalie Portman over Carrie Fisher any day.
The action of the movie is really quite mind blowing stuff. The pod race, the grand battle and the duel between the Jedi and the Sith are all amazing. Ray Park as Darth Maul is particularly impressive.
This is a movie that leaves me impatiently awaiting the sequels.
Luckily, the DVD has lots of cool stuff to play with while I wait. I cannot believe all the stuff that comes on disc two. Some of the documentaries are movie length themselves. I won't go into all the stuff included (it would take too long), but some of my favorite stuff here is: The ""making of"" documentary (even though the sound deteriorates towards the end of it), the ""tone poem"" t.v. spots, the music video for ""Duel of the Fates,"" The deleted scenes documentary, and the featurettes from the web.

As a DVD this is a good buy if you are a Star Wars fan -- and who the hell isn't? -- are interested in the filmmaking process' nuts and bolts, or want to see how a movie that is 80% special effects is really shot. The problem is the ""extra features"" don't hide the fact that ""The Phantom Menace"" is a one-and-a-half star film riding the back of a five-star triology. Badly written, sluggishly paced, filled with one-dimensional characters, and frequent digressions from its own largely incomprehensible plot, this is easily the worst outing of the lot, and the only comfort for fans is that Lucas could scarcely do worse in ""Episode II."" Laim Neeson is pretty good as the worlds-weary Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn, though his character seems to have very little moral sense for a Jedi (""I didn't come here to free slaves,"" he explains at one point....well what the hell kind of guardian of peace & justice are you anyway?). The excellent Ewan McGregor is completely wasted as young Obi-Wan, though he does an excellent job of wielding his lightsaber. Natalie Portman (Queen Amidala) is cute as hell but either she can't act, which I doubt, or she can't choke out her dialogue without sounding like she's reading it upside-down in bad light on a moving train (""Now...ambassador...we...will...discuss...a....new...treaty..."")
and Jake Lloyd just plain sucks as young Darth Vader, though again it's hard to tell where his bad acting stops and the crappy script begins. Ian McDairmid is enjoyably smarmy as chancellor Palpatine, but since he's holding back his villainy for later episodes, he doesn't exactly steal the scenes he's in. And Samuel L. Jackson is strictly a cameo. The most striking character in the film, ironically enough, is Darth Maul, the super-badass Sith Lord who is Darth's precusor. Maul might as well be the Man With No Name for all the dialogue he gets, and those who thought he was going to give ol' Darth a run for his money as a villain will be disappointed. Maul is strictly a man of action, but what action! Actor Ray Park has some outstanding moves, and the lightsaber duel at the end is ALMOST, but not quite, worth watching the rest of the film. All in all, not worth the 16 year wait. My only suggestion, however, would have been letting Maul chop off Jar Jar Binks' head, preferably about halfway through the film, when it becomes painfully apparent this drivelling idiot is going to do his best to ruin an already flawed film. Hopefully somebody else will be quicker on the trigger in the next outing so we won't have to hear his stupid remarks or atrocious, space-rastafarian grammar.",1010534400,2,2771,4.739130434782608

Star Wars is finally on DVD and Lucasfilm and Fox have put together a great one.  This is the first film released in Dolby Digital Surround EX.  It is the best Dolby Digital mix that I have ever heard.  The surround speakers are constantly active so crank up the volume and enjoy.  The film is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen.  The picture looks amazing, the only fault is the occasional edge enhancement.  With that aside, this is still a reference quality disk.  There are several special features spread over the two disks.  The highlights are seven deleted scenes, ""The Beginning"" documentary, five featurettes and an audio commentary by George Lucas and Company.  The audio commentary was excellent and I really like how they spread each persons voice to a different speaker and also used subtitles so you knew who was talking.

The child actor who played Anakin was TERRIBLE.  I don't understand why he was cast, unless his family knows someone special.  Every scene that he is in makes me cringe.  Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman shine.  People have commented that Natalie Portman was a bit stiff as the Queen, but I believe that is her character.  She is a terrific actress.  Other issues were that the pod race scene was way too long.  It was nothing more than a shameless display of Lucasfilm Ltd.'s special effects talent.  It was boring.

661067,4,6303454038,"In the first installment of the Star Wars saga we learn about the origins of Luke's and Leia's parents.  Their mother is Amidala, elected queen of Naboo, and their father is a slave-boy from Tattooine with a very special gift:  Not only can he already reflexively use the Force to hone his skills as a pilot with no prior Jedi training whatsoever, he is stronger in the Force than anyone else ever encountered by the Jedi.
There *is* a storyline here, if you care to find it.  I guess the most annoying thing about this movie is Jake Lloyd's (lack of) acting ability.  Even Natalie Portman's admittedly wooden portrayal of the Queen appears to carry some purpose;  she was very formal while carrying out her official duties, but more relaxed when out of costume.
I also don't see what all the objections are about in regards to alien accents.  It *makes sense* that alien races so different from one another would have different accents when speaking English.  (What do they call it in the Star Wars universe, ""Basic""?)  And for those who believe George Lucas was being racist in his choice of accents, I'm not seeing one single solitary objection to his portraying all Imperial soldiers with British accents in episodes IV, V and VI.  Given Britain's imperial history, that could be construed as racism too or at the very least, stereotyping.
Furthermore, although it is possible that George Lucas made some changes to the storyline between the 1970s and now, it is important to remember that *he had the ENTIRE story written* from episode I to VI before he ever started making A New Hope.  That plot (or lack thereof) you all complain about in Episode I 'cause it looks so ""contrived""?  It's over thirty years old.  He isn't just making this stuff up as he goes along.  He had the opportunity to finally tell the first half of the story, so that's what he's doing.
And finally, there *was* a point to the story of Naboo.  Two points, actually.  Number one, that's how Anakin and Amidala first meet.  Number two, that's how Senator Palpatine ends up being elected Chancellor, thereby becoming the leader of the Old Republic.  Which, if you were paying attention throughout the movie, you know he planned it that way all along.  Knowing Palpatine is also the name of the Emperor in later episodes, an intelligent person ought to be able to put two and two together.

The Video quality for the movie is outstanding, with crystel clear, sharp quality that really enhances it.  The Audio is also excellent, especially the excellent musical score and all the sound effects that have been remastered.
The Features is a good enough reason alone to own this disk.  If you want behind the scenes features, documentarys and deleated scenes, you got e'm.  The first thing people are going to look at, is of course, the Deleted scenes, involving a Waterfall sequence, extended Podrace clips and more.  They are very interesting to look at and very satisfying.  The Documentarys are also very cool, including a hour long documentary that shows Jar Jar tests, The sets being built and my personal favorite, the feature that shows early annimation tests for the podrace and sub sequences, be sure to look at the early versions that are increadebly funny and laugh out loud hilarious to look at.  Just wait untill you see what a early version of Sebulba looks like!
But theres more, if you are truly determened you might find the elusive(and very funny) Bloopers and outtakes, Hint: Watch every feature from beginning to end.

The sound and picture quality are great, but the added bonus scenes they put in the movie are completely worthless.  It was completely a case of ""We can so we will.""  There's a great quote from Ian Malcolm in Jurassic Park: ""You were so worried about whether or not you could you didn't stop to think about whether or not you SHOULD.""  The pod-race scene is now way too long and choppy, and the other added scenes completely broke the flow of the movie.  The one where JarJar comments on the Queen to Anakin is hilarious, but that's the only worthwhile addition.
To top it off, some of the deleted scenes that they DIDN'T put in the movie are great and SHOULD have been put back in.  They are transition scenes that explain a lot about the next scenes (like why Anakin is tired when running to the ship while leaving Tatooine.)  The commentary and documentaries are great for the hard-core fan, but the version of the film they put on disk one is just pathetic.

Watch the original movies and you're treated to subtitles when the aliens speak....because they're ALIENS.
What this movie sacrifices in authenticity, it does no make up for in plot, characterization, or special effects. In the end, Lucas is running a machine now, and the movie's ultimate subtext is that the creator has crossed over to the dark side, forsaken true creativity and taste for the sake of commoditizing Star Wars, his most successful brand more than film at this stage.
For no-holds-barred creativity and masterful storytelling, the Matrix, Dark City, Alien, Aliens, Blade Runner, 2001 are all truer and more compelling, and vastly superior by several orders of magnitude than this empty vessel. Lord of the Rings, which I just saw this week, soundly trumps Lucas's product with its blend of epic and intimate fantastical artistry.

While I cannot hope to know the significance of this film as a part of the entire phenomenon, it does give me the advantage of being able to look at it unbiased light.  I can well understand why many loyal fans of the trilogy were disappointed.  This film desperately needed a Harrison Ford.  It lacked the emotion and charisma he brings to all his roles.  And whether or not you consider the character of Jar Jar Binks to be racially offensive, you have to admit he was so annoying that it was a relief when he finally shut up.  I gave the film three stars purely for the special effects and the fight sequence between Darth Mol and Ewan McGregor.

In spite of all those special effects, the overabuse of computer animation is worse that those seen in Jurassick Park (sequelae II and III), and the lack of inteligent and coherent plot is discouraging.

But this I do not like. Why? It treats the audience like idiots. It treats us like idiots with half-efforted and sub-par CGI effects. It treats us like idiots with a bad plot, characters, inane characters (except Maul, Kenobi, and Jinn) and writing, and with a child actor who can't act (so why is he called an actor?).
The thing is, the CGI effects look fake enough, but Lloyd's acting is worst. The thing is, he acted as though he ENJOYED his life of slavery. They should have had Haley Joel Osment to show a more sad, scared, tormented kid like he did in ""The Sixth Sense"" but the thing is OSMENT AUDITIONED FOR THE ROLE AS ANAKIN SKYWALER YET THEY STILL CHOSE LLOYD FOR THE ROLE!! The thing is, they used cuteness over talent when they where on audions, when it should be vice-versa. It was as though Jake Lloyd was throwing animal crackers at me boasting how cute he was.

661188,4,6303454038,"May 19th 1999, you saw it on Theaters. January 2000, you enjoyed it on VHS with a production featurette. But this is the most complete Star Wars video release ever, thanks to the power of DVD technology. George Lucas has embedded so much material in the two discs, that even die-hard Star Wars fans will be delighted for hours and hours. In fact, no other DVD I own has blown me away like this. Where to start?
Disc One obviously contains the feature; subtitles, anamorphic widescreen and commentary by George Lucas and company included -the standard stuff, if you may. Non-standard, however, is the fact that you can link to hidden StarWars.com material by having the DVD on your computer's DVD-ROM tray, namely access to large-screen versions of a couple of already-released trailers of Episode II, and exclusive (until the time of this writing) access to yet another trailer for the upcoming continuation of the saga.
Disc 2, though, is where most of the really cool material in the DVD is to be found, for those who like and those who dislike the movie, as well. To begin with, a full documentary containing all deleted scenes (some of them will actually make you hate the movie's editor!) along with interviews with Francis Ford-Coppola and a couple more great Directors/Editors, to hear the opinions about the whole process of editing a movie once it's been filmed in its entirety.
 The best part of Disc 2, however, is an all-new hour-long documentary shot during the production of the movie, that will captivate everyone. Complementing it are a 12-part award-winning Web documentary and five featurettes that go over more details about the pre-production/production of the movie. Some of its parts also made it to the full-length documentary, but essentially they're different pieces. Among the interesting things you get to see are what the crew had to go through when a desert storm blew away all their stuff, what Lucas called ""bad droid karma"" (all the history of technical complications around R2-D2) and how the brilliant final duel between Darth Maul and the Jedis was staged.
Altogether George Lucas has opened up like never before, offering the movie within the movie, and showing why he is, in Liam Neeson's words ""one of the world's greatest storytellers."" Get a copy of this DVD: it has to be part of your movie collection, if not for the movie itself (which most people tend to agree as not being the best SW movie), for all the hours of pre-production and production material you can enjoy on it.",1008547200,4,2518,4.855813953488372

I loved the saber-fights too and I loved the Jedi-talk (may the force be with you, etc.). I even bought the video, because after having not seen it for a while I thought of this movie as cool and, well, I liked the other Star Wars movies when I was kid and after all, somebody gave it to me as a present.
That's how I came to own SWI on video. After watching the movie at I suddenly realized that this movie has no real sense or intellect behind it. There's a lot of awesome special effects, but visual effects are not exactly the reason I watch movies for. First of all, Episode I, prayed for by loads of fans for decades, does not fit into the scheme of the later 3 episodes at all. Alright, we get to see what Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi (however you spell that mofo)looked like as a kid, but the invasion of Naboo has nothing to do with the universe-threatening conflicts of episode IV-VI.

And with episodes two and three quickly approaching, ""Phantom"" will surely find its niche.
Besides, after watching it over again, ""The Phantom Menace"" began to grow on me. Maybe it's the podracer sequence or the lightsaber clashes with Ray Park's (""Sleepy Hollow"", ""X-Men"") Darth Maul. Or maybe ol' George is just putting something in the water; I don't know.

I think a lot of people are missing the main purpose of this story: Anakin's first meeting with Obi-Wan, Palpatine's beginning's, and Anakin meeting his future wife and mother of Luke and Leia. A lot of things point to the fact that there won't be a huge span of years between Episode III and Episode IV, that's why there wasn't a huge amount of development in the first one.

661250,1,6303454038,"I must say that seeing this movie for the first time back in 1999 was just about the greatest disappointment in my life as a Star Wars fan. I'm still trying to recover before the next botched episode in this series is released next year. I can truly say I have been a good and loyal Star Wars fan all my life (although I don't give a hoot about all the off-shoot comic books, novels etc. that have come out in the last two decades--Mara Jade--what???), but I can honestly say I LOATHE this movie! The acting is dull and mindless, Jar Jar Binks made me shudder with revulsion every moment he was on screen, I wince and cringe at so many idiotic bits of dialogue and leaps of logic (Midi-chlorians for one--good God!) and empty attempts at inane humor.  The flatness and barrenness of the whole over-produced, over-special-effected grandiosity of this mish-mash is a sincerely disheartening experience. I pray I may never have to sit through it again. Perhaps a five-year-old would approve of the silliness, but no adult Star Wars die-hard should suffer through this mess. The force of personality with which Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and (May the Force Bless Her!) Carrie Fisher give to the original movies, not to mention the clear-cut storyline and heart-pounding drama of the original movies as well, it totally lacking. Not that they were any Shakespearian actors, by my gosh, Carrie Fisher could wipe little sweetie-puss Natalie Portman all over the Death Star.
My advise-- stay away from his travesty!!!!!",1007942400,8,1512,4.837837837837838
661251,4,6303454038,"Although I haven't seen the original Star Wars movie in a while, I think this story fits nicely into the beginning.  My only complaint as to it's beginnings is it still doesn't tell us how and when the Jedi academy came into being.  That I would have liked to know...but...oh well.
Episode One basically begins to show the fall of the trade routes and the rise of the Dark Lord, whom we know will become Anakin's 'Dark Side' mentor.  And Anakin will, of course, be coaxed into the dark side and become Darth Vader.  Right now, Anakin is a cute little boy, innocent and forthright.  He wins a Pod race for the Jedi protecting the princess whom will become Anakin's lover/wife and give birth to Princess Lea and Luke Skywalker.  The actress who plays this role (The Princess) seemed a bit stiff to me.  I hope her role in the future movies relaxes a bit and falls into place.
The movie was exciting and loaded with CGI shots...maybe too many shots.  One of the main characters, Jar Jar Binks, is completely CGI and I found that a little disconcerting.  With today's make up possibilities and blue screens, I believe an actor could've handled that role (I mean, look at Planet of the Apes!).
Also, I have to wonder when --- or if --- we'll see an early Han Solo or Chewie.  Although these characters didn't come into play in the original Star Wars until later, I think most fans would enjoy seeing these individuals humble (or not so humble) beginnings.
The choice for the future 'Emperor' was ghoulish and nicely done (he's a real slime-bag playing the role of savior...perfect!).  Obi-One was also well casted.  And him taking on Anakin to train as a Jedi once Obi-One's master was killed by Darth Maul was well executed (gives some real meat and potatoes to the legend of Obi-One).
We'll have to see how the next movie stacks up in the series.  This one I'd give a B+.  Well executed with too much CGI.",1007856000,,1902,4.523391812865497

If you enjoy a good martial arts fight, see this. Forget the rest of it. I enjoy this movie for the special effects, Ewan McGregor, the INCREDIBLE! fight-sequenes and the beautiful costumes. The movie does not hold with the original trilogy as much as I'd like, but since Episode II is going to AWESOME, you'd better see this first.
The special features on this DVD are to die for. Go immediately to the fight and costume short features. They created an entirely new form of martial arts for this movie. If you're a martial arts fan or want to know more about the Jedi, this feature is amazing. The theory behind the fighting is really intricate. Costumes are just beautiful.

And, no villan what so ever, if you have a character like Darth Maul, use it, make it talk, but not hide it, I remember the good old Darth Vader, but in this movie he was a way to merry little kid, even in movies children can be good characters, not some Cartoon Network wannabe's.

661258,4,6303454038,"Of all the movies released in recent years, undoubtedly the one that has been given the most unjustified criticism in recent years is ""Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantomn Menace"". The reasons for this are varied, but the truth is that this movie is quite good. This is of course Chapter One in a six part story (a fact most critics of the movie seem not to understand the implications of:). The movie is therefore not going to give you a ""they all lived happily ever after"" though it is amaingly able to come close to it. Brilliant effect is piled onto brilliant effect and there are many great sequences: the journey through the planet core, the escape from Naboo, the pod race, and on through the finale.
The only criticism is that some of the acting is a little stiff (Natalie Portman's Queen Amidala is a little weak though she does just fine as handmaiden Padme) and that C3PO is left on Tatooine and thus misses the last third of the movie.
I would point out that once Episodes 2 and 3 are released, I believe the reputation of Phantomn Menace will soar, as I am sure there was some forshadowing in various places that one just can't see without seeing Episodes 2 and 3.",1007596800,,1176,4.423963133640553
661259,3,6303454038,"George Lucas should be horse-whipped! Yes, you heard me correctly. I,like zillions of fans,eagerly went to theater in the summer of'99 hoping for more of that old Star Wars magic. What I got instead was a cheesy, trite, in parts boring, in parts painfully annoying, 2 hour commercial. Sigh...I knew this movie was in trouble when, a half hour in a main character said ""Exsqueeze me""..??? I think I grimaced and gasped when I heard this; Thats when I knew ""The Force no longer with George is"".
Now, let me just say that I had no overblown expectations of this movie..I just wanted a good movie that continued( or rather) initiated the star wars saga story. The only things I expected were the things that made me love the first star wars, charcter development, good plot, witty dialogue(that yes, was sometimes cheesy)but most of all, a basic respect for the story and the characters in it. I received none of these things. Simply put, Mr. Lucas took us for granted and got lazy on the script, expecting the audiences prior emotions for the past trilogy to 'carry them thru' this movie. Well, Im sorry George, but you have to work harder than that. You can't just throw out ill conceived barely developed characters, trite dialogue, threadbare plotlines and contrived battle sequences and expect me to hollah. Really George...what were you thinking??? George failed to make me give a darn about many of the characters in this story, no honest human emotion for me to identify with, nothing, nothing to get me engaged with the character. You would think that George would have worked extra hard at character development...esp considering that..err...WE ALREADY KNOW HOW THE STORY ENDS!!!!! ....with that fact in mind ,one would think you would work extra hard to make characters the audience can relate to and want to share the crazy wild ride with. But no..what do we get? Jar Jar Binks. Well I have one thing to say ""Peeeeeee uuuuuuuu.....that smells stinkofish!""
Now..the reason I give the DVD 3 stars is well..b/c it was a good package..The extras are the real prize in this box set. Others have complained of the DVD transfer..but since I have a bad tv I don't really notice it so I give the optics a good rating. The sound is good too, but the gems are the extras ..the music video however is very bad..lifted right from the TPH video game(classy George)..and the visuals for the video are really crude. But overall, the extras are what make this dvd worth it.
Back to movie bashing. I hope, I really do, hope and pray that George takes some of this criticism to heart and goes back to the thinsg that made the first trilogy so great(namely...getting all those great wrtiers who worked on the first trilogy to write for him again) Visually, the movie was arresting, but not groundbreakingly stunning. I still feel more a sense of wonder and world-immersion from watching Star WArs than I do Menace...go figure?. So, I guess my point here George is , more plot, more characterization, lets CGI crud...The Cell proved..you can have all the smoke and mirrors in the world, (...)..-A.N.",1007510400,2,3086,4.770093457943926

Whereas Star Wars was more shoot- em- up, this is better at portraying a story. ( enough siskel and ebert)

661313,5,6303454038,"This one is worth buying for any fan of the Star Wars franchise.
That said, as a film, George has left much to be desired (and some to be rebuffed, eg. Jar Jar). Science Fiction fans unfamiliar with Star Wars (as if they existed) would still like this one, but the general viewing public would probably be disappointed in the relative weakness present, especially versus the other films from George Lucas.
However, and this is a *big* however: this review is for the DVD, which transfer is among the most amazing ever. Sound is impeccable, video fantastic, and the extra features, including bonus footage originally cut but finished specifically for this DVD, are to die for. Its quite an unreal package for DVD genre enthusiasts, though no Nuon features (unless perhaps in easter-egg format).

661314,3,6303454038,"In theatres, George Lucas' ""Star Wars:  Episode I, The Phantom Menace"" (whew!) had one transcendent moment:  when the lights went down, the familiar fanfare blared, and the words ""Star Wars"" soared into deep space.  Then, like a spaceship with a hull breach, the air leaked out, and all life with it.  Trade embargos?  What th'?!!?  A space adventure epic that begins with an economics lesson?  I've got a bad feeling about this...

Unfortunately, in this ""Star Wars,"" there's lots of energy but no drama.  An example?  R2-D2's intro, completely without verve or context; we're supposed to instantly get emotional simply because HEY LOOK- it's R2-D2, that cute li'l guy from the first trilogy, and he might get blown up!  But it isn't earned by what Lucas puts on the screen; rather, it lazily trades off our warm feelings for the earlier films.  Perhaps Lucas assumes the audience already adores the ""Star Wars"" universe and all its merchandise, so he's free to cut corners.  Also, there's no climax to this moment.  The space queen merely ""commends"" R2 in another scene that's so static, so formal and emotionless, it might as well be performed entirely by kitchen appliances.  Okay, prepare yourself, because here comes the gratuitous anti-Jar-Jar section of the review...

And then there's Mr. Binks, the recipient of many Internet death threats.  You know you're in trouble when the hardest workin' guy in your movie is the one everyone despises.  Obnoxious and omnipresent, Jar-Jar Binks ruins every scene he's in (about 90% of the movie).  I don't fault Ahmed Best; he actually performs quite well.  It's the role that stinks.  Sir Lawrence Olivier couldn't have played it!  Kids hate Jar-Jar, adults loathe him.  His action figures choke our landfills.  Jar-Jar.  Another cultural touchstone for a generation, albeit not in the manner Lucas intended.

Double-J aside, everyone else seems only mildly engaged in the story.  Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan comes off best, but Liam Neeson is sour, and Natalie Portman seems ill at ease talking to CGI freaks and beeping trashcans.  In fact, she rarely seems to be talking with them, as much as at them.  As for poor Jake Lloyd, he's only as bad as everyone else.  Annoying little cuss, though, with his ""Yippee!"" and ""Are you an angel?"" cutesy lines.  And when you create such a visually impressive villian as horn-headed Darth Maul... he should actually DO SOMETHING IN THE MOVIE!

Mainly, ""Phantom Menace"" proves set-pieces and ancillary marketing do not a movie make.  Knock out sequences such as the pod-race and the climactic battles are made to seem ridiculous due to childishness, and too much serendipity.  It's as if Lucas is better at imagining scenes than filming them, and better at directing robots and puppets than human beings.  Too bad... we may go to a movie to see the puppets, but learn to love it because of the characters.  Plus, why should we have to buy a lot of toys and books in order to fully appreciate what's onscreen?  Why can't the movie be self-contained, rather than the lynchpin of a marketing juggernaut?

The DVD version overflows with info, documentaries and the like.  Extras include the ""Duel of Fates"" music video (the music's more compelling minus Mannequin Skywalker and the rest of the film), storyboards, animatics, deleted footage and commentary from Lucas and others involved.  If you're a ""Star Wars"" fan, or completist, you'll definitely want this stuff.  It's a lot more interesting than the movie, but has a desperate air about it.  It's Lucas begging us to love ""Phantom Menace"" because he and his imaginative elves worked so hard on it.  And bless their hearts, they really did!",1007337600,,3677,4.9688013136289

I found the plot extremely clinched. I doubt there was anything original in the movie. That wasn't even really the worst though. All the charm of Star Wars was gone. R2D2 was reduced to a computer on wheels without a personality. Also the action looks ridiculous because the Jedis are obviously just swinging in any which direction and then the bullets they hit are added by computer graphics. And the out come I think would be better described as dancing rather than fighting.  To make that worse during most all the action sequences the actors look like they are doing anything, but struggling.  How can the watcher be excited when the actor looks bored?  The acting through out the entire film was amateurish. Lastly I should mention the plot was almost entirely driven by consciences not by any logical construction.

661316,2,6303454038,"First let me say that I grew up with Star Wars.  I know every line of Episodes 4 through 6 by heart, and they have always spoken to me on an emotional and spiritual level.
Perhaps emotions and spirituality form part of the reason why I so revile Episode 1.  The Phantom Menace has neither emotion or spirit, simply a parade of the most complex special effects that George Lucas could muster.  Granted, the special effects are breathtaking in places.  In fact, parts of the movie are very good.  These parts are typically the ones with no dialogue.  The dialogue is wooden, and the actors, a formidable array of talent, still are unable to add any life to the movie.  Obi-Wan has no particular depth, nor does Qui-Gon, nor Anakin, nor Padme/Amidala, nor Palpatine, nor Jar Jar.
While some have argued that the next movies will explain everything, I do not understand how 2 more movies can explain why Lucas occupied two hours of my life with utterly one-dimensional characters.  Others have told me to look at this movie in the context of the original trilogy and the movies to come.  I do not see how any other movies could possibly be relevant to THIS movie.  The fact is that the script is poor, the direction poor, and the acting is poor.
As a prequel, in fact as the very FIRST movie in a story that spans 6 films, this film should above all establish character.  Instead Lucas settled for special effects.  I give this movie two stars.  I only give it two because of the wonderful effects and the exciting final lightsaber battle.  I refuse to give it more stars on the merits of the Star Wars name.  A bad movie is a bad movie regardless of its pedigree.

Also, i hate to comment on another review but had this movie premeired back when star wars did...it would definitely NOT be a flop, the exact opposite, it would have no hype whatsoever therefore no other movies to live up to.

So, I won't be buying this DVD, because if I can't stand to watch the movie again -- and Lloyd makes it absolutely unbearable to watch -- there's no sense owning the DVD, special features or not.

But, by giving us Episodes 4, 5 and 6 he used the back end of a story to leave us panting for more. And he delivered more. We don't care that the acting is horrid or the plot is wobbly.

The movie is interesting on a Star Wars point of view, the highlight is Natalie Portman as the Queen, well acted and great make-up and costume! other than that this movie is really a bust.
Samuel L. Jackson in this movie is so misplaced.  He looks like Samuel L. Jackson in costume on a Star Wars set.  Liam Neeson is also miscast, Ewan MacGregor is good however.
The movie is just a mish-mash that goes toooooo long with the race sequence involving young Luke, and the battle with those robots-...well what can I say, the special effects are really bad, they look painted on they don't look real.
Episode 1 is not a special effects marvel, nor a acting marvel and they killed the villian OFF! NEVER KILL THE VILLAIN OFF WITH 'DARTH' IN THE NAME!

A young Obi Wan Kenobi and his master Qui Gon Jin uncover the plot by the evil Darth Sidious to break down the Republic by manipulating the new Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, played by the same actor who played his evil Emperor Palpatine character in the first trilogy, Ian McDiarmid.  They also discover a boy, young Anakin Skywalker, strong with the Force, and promising as the prophecized ""one who will bring balance to the Force.""  It is very exciting for any Star Wars fan to see how it all began.  The movie answers so many questions that begin to make the original saga make more sense.  Where did Anakin begin, and what weaknesses brought him to the Dark Side?  How did the Sith return?  The movie is outstanding.
I haven't even mentioned the special effects yet, but I have just one word for them: So-realistic-it-is-mind-boggling.  Never has a Star Wars Episode seen such amazing special effects.  And virtually every camera shot has some digital effect applied.  One must applaud all of the cast for their oustanding work in interacting with their digital co-stars.  Just a couple minutes into the film, and you don't even consider that the Battle Droids aren't real.  ILM has done such a fantastic job that you completely accept them as real.

The DVD authorship itself is top-notch; the sub-menus duck and dip around pod-racer tracks, Gungan battles, ships holds, etc. It's well crafted and well-thought out.
The commentary track may seem overbearing at first, with 7 people talking. But this is a film made by comittee, and it works, anyway. The comments are insightful and point out much of the craftsmanship that went into the film in a way that a pure documentary simply can't. Plus it's nice to hear Ben Burrt explain the origins of many of the sound effects - Star Wars has always had the best sounds and it's nice to hear about their creation.

661404,4,6303454038,"""Star Wars, Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" is one of those films where I was, in a strange way, more satisfied by the trailer than by the actual film. A ""prequel"" to the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy of films, ""Phantom Menace"" takes us several decades back in time in relation to the action of those films. As with the earlier films, ""Phantom Menace"" transports us to a world of science-fiction adventure involving robots, exotic aliens, and epic space battles.
The plot of ""Menace"" involves a young boy named Anakin (who will grow up to be the Darth Vader of the original trilogy) and young Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi. They become involved in a starship blockade of the planet Naboo, whose heroic queen seeks to save her people from invasion.
""Menace"" has many admirable elements. The cast is very good. I was impressed by young Jake Lloyd in the challenging role of Anakin. There are some truly spectacular action sequences. Although the pod race (a sort of high-tech chariot race) is a prominent episode, my favorite action sequence is a thrilling scene of robotic heroics outside the skin of a starship during battle. The set designs, costumes, and special effects make the film a stunning visual feast. And the musical score superbly combines classic ""Star Wars"" motifs with some newer elements.
But despite all this, I found the film to be strangely underwhelming. I was also disturbed by creator George Lucas' use of violence in the film. As in the original ""Star Wars,"" Lucas seems to cheat by presenting us with a sanitized version of war violence. Whereas in the first film faceless masked enemy soldiers were shot in large numbers, in ""Phantom"" our heroes dismember and ""kill"" huge hordes of robot soldiers. Lucas seems to be making mass slaughter bloodless and ""fun.""
This robot carnage is particularly disturbing in connection with the film's rather trivial treatment of the issue of slavery. Although robot troops are killed by the heroes, our two friendly robots (R2-D2 and C-3PO, also seen in the original trilogy) are treated as virtual slaves, even though they seem to be self-aware beings. Although the freeing of human slaves is presented as a relevant (although underdeveloped) issue in the film, no concern seems to be given to the situation of these intelligent artificial life forms. I wonder -- what would Mr. Data from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" have to say about all this?
I noticed one big difference between ""Phantom"" and the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy. The originals always struck me, whatever their flaws, as films for the whole family. ""Phantom,"" on the other hand, often feels like a film made specifically for kids; it seems like Lucas is taking his adult audience for granted. Too many silly elements mar the film for me. Consider the much-despised ""Phantom"" character Jar-Jar Binks; although I didn't hate this character as much as some fans, by the end of the film his idiotic antics were really getting on my nerves. Yes, ""The Phantom Menace"" is an exciting and visually impressive film, but its flaws leave a bad aftertaste.",1006819200,,3070,4.928571428571429
661405,5,6303454038,"The Phantom Menace disappointed many of the Star Wars fanatics. But what film could have recaptured the enthusiasm we felt toward the original trilogy?  The technical achievement alone in further realizing Lucas' vision is worth the price of this DVD.  Unlike the fantasy stories of Tolkien and Rowling, Star Wars has always been told through film.  As a result, we constantly thirst for the complete vision of the Universe created by George Lucas. The Phantom Menace delivers.
The Star Wars enthusiast can poke holes in Lucas' choices in both plot and character.  That is a luxury that the Star Wars trilogy gives us.  After all, half the fun is critiquing this beloved fantasy world.
The DVD is outstanding and encourages multiple viewings.  The deleted scenes included are not all that interesting, but the documentary on the creation of Episode One is worth watching.
Any Star Wars fan should be ashamed if they do not own this DVD, even if they don't like Jar Jar Binks.",1006819200,,975,4.878787878787879
661406,3,6303454038,"This review won't sway anyone one way or another.  Most people will buy this dvd regardless of their views of this one episode to keep their collection complete, but here's my two cents:
I love the Star Wars series.  I still enjoy rewatching the first three movies and can even put up with the Ewoks.  But this entry in the series is a total letdown.
Sure, it does fill in an important part of the Star Wars history, and could be used to build up to a great story, but by itself it is useless.  We get to see some interesting political maneuverings, for example, but without the payoff (we have to wait until the next movie).  The special effects ARE stunning (although the old animatronics and models still look better than some, not all, of the digitally produced characters and machines), but there is none of the storytelling magic of the first three.  About Jar Jar Binks (WHAT WAS LUCAS THINKING!?!?!?):  I did not understand how a character, especially a good guy, could be so utterly reviled by an audience until I saw this movie and was converted.  To be fair, his scenes during the big battle are somewhat comic, but most of the time he is a complete and utter irritant, made worse by the fact that some of the weakest digital imaging is done for his character. Darth Maul (or however his name is spelled) is an overrated villian.  Sure, he is visually interesting and a great fighter, but his character is never developed!  For the approx. ten minutes he's on screen, he just fights and says nothing.  (He'll probably be brought back somehow and hopefully given even a one-dimensional personality). For all we know, he's a nice guy who likes kittens who mistakenly thinks he's helping defend the good guys (although I seriously doubt it).  Lastly, the pod race is somewhat exciting (less so on the small screen), but there are many racing movies that are much better.
Overall, when viewed as part of the new trilogy, it'll likely be an important piece of an overall (I hope) great story, but for now, on its own, it fails to live up to Lucas' legacy.",1006732800,13,2061,4.570652173913044
661447,5,6303454038,"When I originally saw this in the theaters (opening week, of course), I was somewhat disappointed.  When it came out on DVD, I rented it and liked it better.  I bought the DVD and have viewed it several times since then.  Each time I like it better.  There is much more to the story than meets the eye (and Jar-Jar gets less annoying).  Although the transfer isn't the greatest, it is still good and better than some theaters.",1006732800,,426,4.410256410256411
661448,5,6303454038,"Ok so this isn't the best star wars movie, but still its very underrated by critical [...]. The Movie is great but the DVD is spectacular the sound is unbeleavible ( especially with surround sound !). The shots are stunning and the special feature are actually watchable. Plus its loaded with DVD easter eggs [...]. The eggs feature funny outakes and a secret documentary. Some of the deleted scenes are inserted into the movie which is great! Some though you have to access via the special features. Another Great feature is the 2 hour ""The Beginning"" a great Star Wars 1 documentary. Plus its got exclusic DVD-ROM Episode 2 Trailer only available to owners of the DVD (must have DVD-ROM). So all in all this is a winner and this is why we have DVD.",1006560000,,750,4.562962962962963
661449,4,6303454038,"Episode I is not the best of the four Star Wars films but really the comparison should not be made. The sonic boom of technology and computer animation over the past 20 years has vastly changed the possibilities on screen (see Shrek, Toy Story, or Monsters Inc). Lucas has given us a modern day version of a Star Wars tale. The main difference between the two generations of films is that in the early movies the focus was on character development, whereas now the focus is on eye candy. Don't get wrong, I love me some good eye candy, and Episode I has plenty of it. The lightsaber duels in the desert and at the finale are nothing short of breathtaking, and the pod race is easily the best scene in the film. The character development in Episode I is there but not nearly as in depth as any of the first three. Episode I serves as an introduction to such characters as Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, Princess Amadala, and Anakin Skywalker. It is pretty clear that George Lucas wanted to make a technically superior film with Episode I and in that respect he has succeeded. However, I do believe that the best is yet to come. Lucas claims that Episode III will be the ""darkest"" of all the Star Wars films depicting Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader, and that is great news for those of us who believe that the Empire Strikes Back was the best of the first three films. Anyway, no self respecting Star Wars fan should be without this DVD. The sound quality is superior to anything I have ever heard and the extras and options are fantasic. This is a great bargain. Highly Recommended.",1006560000,,1578,4.501742160278746
661450,3,6303454038,"If this had been the first ""Star Wars"" movie to hit theaters 20 years ago, I'm confident that it would have been a flop, there wouldn't have been a part 2 or 3, and there wouldn't now be, 20+ years later, a Star Wars legacy with millions of fans world-wide. If asked to stand on its own, this movie just crumbles under own weight. The acting is abysmal, the dialog isn't much better, and though the plot has a lot going for it, it falls completely flat under Lucas's bad direction. The spark of magic George had when he directed Episode 4 is pretty much absent from this production. I don't mean to be offensive, but for a great many of us this movie was a HUGE letdown, and it simply does not stand on its own merits.
The DVD on the otherhand is a pretty impressive production. It is loaded with all sorts high-quality extras including a great ""making of"" documentary, deleted scenes, commentary, and much more. Though I dislike the movie, I feel that the DVD is worth owning simply because of the weath of interesting information available in these extras.",1006473600,11,1058,4.487046632124352

You won't find that here.  Perhaps in the next release it will be.  As for the story line.... Lucas is brilliant.  Sure it was a little kiddish, but they will age with the film just like the rest of us did with the origional trilogy, think about it.  A new hope looked like a one time shot, so he couldn't take the kid route.  It's a trilogy, this was only Part I.  My guess is that Part III will be pretty rockin, Part II will have to be better or Part III will never be made. The next films greatness will remain to be seen, but I can see where Lucas is headed.",1006473600,,736,4.133802816901408
661452,4,6303454038,"I don't know why so many dis-like this film, sure it's not perfect but it's not bad either. I was a bit disapointed but not enough to hate it. The only bad things about it is that there's no character build-up what so ever. Jah-Jah is annoying, Anakin is too cheerful to believe he becomes Darth Vader. When he gets told he'll be a Jedi he says....""Yipee!!"". How's this for an idea for the special special edition. When Vader becomes good again, he finds his inner child, takes off the mask and yells yippee!!.
  It's way too slow in the middle that when it finally got to the pod race I was almost sleeping in the theater. Plus Anakin blowing up a ship and being a hero like Luke in ""A New Hope"" doesn't really work. Obi-Wan is so cool too and is better than Luke yet a little kid has more lines and more screen time. What made this film good for me was the visuals, the Pod Race, Darth Maul and the light saber duel at the end. Some fans didn't like Ewoks so much that they didn't like Return of the Jedi. Jah-Jah is so annoying in Episode 1 that he makes you wish Ewoks were in it instead.",1006387200,,1092,4.14622641509434
661453,5,6303454038,"Many people that claim to be Star Wars fans are venomously against this movie.  I don't understand it - this is a very worthy addition to the Star Wars universe.  The fun is there (""I have a bad feeling about this""), the action is there (especially the lightsabre duels - far superior to any of the previous ones), and the movie is a fun experience.  All the SW movies are thin on plot and have hokey dialogue - why are people upset that this one should too?
The main problem with this film is that we already know the end (Return of the Jedi).  SW fans will consider these films as history.  There's little suspense in Darth Maul vs. Obi-wan because we know Obi-wan lives another 30 years!  Similarly, Anakin is obviously going to survive the pod race and the space battle, because he lasts until RotJ.  By the same argument, we cannot shed tears for other characters that we know are dead in the ""present"" - Amidala, Qui-gon, Mace Windu, etc.  Thus, some dramatic tension is lost.  Having said that, though, the fun of SW is the action and immersion in the Galaxy Far, Far Away.
The DVD edition is fantastic, even if you think the movie is sub-par.  There are numerous behind-the-scenes features, all of which give a nifty inside look at the making of the film.  Especially interesting is the look at the digital manipulation of people and places.  Parts are very impressive - Coruscant, the Gungan city, etc.  Others need some work - Jar Jar is the most obvious.  There's something very unnatural about the way he moves, occasionally defying the laws of physics, and he's distracting in the background because he moves too much.  The cut scenes are fun to see, the commentary is full of tidbits and features George Lucas and several others (including ILM fixture Ben Burtt), and a neat 3-way split-screen feature on how storyboards are brought to the screen.  There's also the obligatory ads (both TV and cinema), some of which I never saw before, and the video for Duel of the Fates.
The combination of a pretty good movie on a great DVD full of extras makes this the jewel of my DVD collection, and highly recommended.",1006387200,,2123,4.591511936339523

Second, I hate that kid who plays Anakin. Third, the pod race was a bit too long for my taste. After a while, it made me seem as though lucas didn't have enough material for the movie, so he pumped the movie with pod racing.

661455,4,6303454038,"This movie has perhaps been reviewed more than any other movie in history and the expectations were higher than ever, so let's see if anything can be added to what has been said already.
1. The dvd:
The dvd is brilliant. Never before has the extra material on a dvd been so extensive. The menu's are beautiful, the deleted scenes are great (special effects added esspecially for the dvd), and the documentaries give a very good insight into how the movie was made without getting dull.
2. The story:
Compared to the classic movies the story seems a bit thin. The main story (the battle between the Naboo aided by the Jedi vs the Federation aided by the Sith) serves only as a means to show the state of the Star Wars galaxy at this point in time. A galaxy where the Galactic senate has lost control over it's people and a galaxy where a business organisation (the Federation) can hold a planet hostage over tax disputes without any resistance of the government. The greatest weakness of the story of this first film is that you probably need to see the next two movies to appreciate it's main point, namely that the real bad guy Senator Palpatine aka Darth Sidious uses the confusion he has caused to let himself be appointed Supreme Chancellor of the galaxy. So the bad guys really win at the end of this movie and this is not clear to most viewers when the movie is finished.
3. The Characters:
Qui-gon Jinn: Good strong character, the most important person in this movie as it is he who set's the wheels in motion that begin Anakin's life as a Jedi.
Obi-wan Kenobi: Good character although a bit stiff. Shows a certain wisdom beyond his age.
Anakin Skywalker: Irritating know-it-all. Not nearly as wonderful as everybody thinks he is. ""I can fix anything"", right!
Queen Amidala/Padme: Stiff as the queen, somewhat more interesting as Padme. Some parallel's to Leia in A New Hope.
Jar Jar Binks: Overtly present. Sometimes funny, sometimes not at all, but not nearly as annoying as most people say if you don't pay to much attention to him (which is kinda difficult at times).
Which brings me to the movies High's and Low's:
High's: Podrace (the most important action sequence in the movie)
The political scheming (if you understand the meaning of it all to the larger story). Overall special effects are stunning.
Low's: Story not clear enough, Jar Jar (at times), Bad guys don't have enough screen time (Darth Maul is great!).",1006214400,12,2430,4.666666666666667

661528,5,6303454038,"Although Episode 1 has been frequently put down, it compares favorably to the original Star Wars episodes (4-6). The Phantom Menace manages to couch victory for the bad guy (Darth Sidious who maneuvers Senator Palpatine into power) within a story which provides a superficial victory for the good guys.  Unlike the original Star Wars movies, Episode 1 has several storylines running in parallel, and not all is what it appears on the surface.  It was unfortunate enough to be come at the end of 17 years of expectations of millions of fans.  On its own merits it combines a fast-paced adventure with stunningly original scenes, settings, and characters.  The podrace is a terrific mixture of sight and sound, and the final duel with Darth Maul is beautifully choreographed and executed.  While Jar Jar Binks' antics are jarringly childish against the backdrop of the rest of the movie, he's only a minor annoyance for most, and younger kids find him entertaining.
The DVD itself is loaded with extras, including a thorough behind-the-scenes documentary which is worth seeing more than once just to get an idea of the work that went into the movie.  The audio commentary is interesting, but not the best I've heard.",1006128000,3,1214,4.955665024630542

Viewed in it's own lights, and compared to other stories of the space opera genre of the 30s and 40s, we see a movie that actually holds up pretty well, has great special effects, and is a nice interesting ""flashback"" into the prehistory of the main star wars trilogy.
While there are some inconsistancies, few of the serials published in the 30s-50s didn't have their own sets of inconsistancies as well (I can't think of any offhand), so arguing about them is truely a task for hobgoblins.
If what you are looking for is pure entertainment, you enjoy state of the art CGI, (note the interesting and realistic gait on Jar Jar) and you're not too worried about having realistic physics (noise in a vaccum?) or have put the previous trilogy on an unobtainable pedastle (which with careful viewing, one might find it doesn't obtain either!), you'll enjoy Episode I.

First off let me say that you have not seen Star Wars until you have experienced this DVD. I have all the currently released VHS Star Wars video's and I always recognized a grainy, blurry quality to the original trilogy as well as Episode One, now the video is crystal clear. Even on my computer's DVD player (which is theoretically lower quality than a hardware player), the picture is like the movie theater, but twice as clear. Also adding to the theater effect is one of the first DVD's that includes the Dolby Surround 5.1 EX soundtrack to it. This makes itself present in the Podrace and the last battles between the Gungans and TF, as well as the lightsaber battle. One of the main reasons I bought this was because of the deleated scenes. Lucasfilm even added about 3 min. of bonus footage to the final version, including some really excellent additions to the Podrace. The other behind the scenes featurettes on the 2nd disc are amazing. The main behind the scene feature is about 1hr long! I bought this a week ago and I still have not seen all the bonus features. Never have I seen a DVD so well crafted. Another feature that should be mentioned is that with this DVD, you can see Star Wars: Episode Two trailers exclusivley, before they are released to the theaters if you have a DVD-ROM and internet access.

Better than Star Wars... incredibly better than Jedi... and just as good as The Empire Strikes Back, my favorite entry in the original series.  Granted, it's not perfect but the positives outweigh the negatives here...
Pluses:
Jake Lloyd does an excellent job as young Anakin.  Back when the film was first released, I read an article that said that that little annoying elfin lad Haley Joel Osment was considered for this role.  I'm so glad Lucas chose this kid instead.  Lloyd is charming and likable as the future Darth Vader.
Liam Neeson, Ian McKellen, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman are also fine in their roles. Ray Park(s) (aka Darth Paul) was also a great addition to the ensemble.  However, his talents were mostly used in fight sequence and just looking completely sinister.
I also liked all of the little pieces of continuity and history that are in the film. We see how C3PO and R2D2 meet... a young Yoda... a young Greedo... just what Emperor Palpatine was before he became the Emperor... and we even get to see a young Jabba the Hutt and Bibfortuna, too!
Finally, the special effects are awesome.  Lucas outdid himself here.  I sat there in awe for the entire duration of the movie.  No other film has ever had that kind of effect on me.
But there also a few negative spots, too:
Samuel L. Jackson wasn't used as much as he should've been.
Jar Jar Binks annoyed the bejesus out of me.
No Wookiees.  There should've been at least ONE Wookiee in the movie dagnabbit!  :)

I thought I had an understanding of what the makers of these films were trying to say. I guess I was wrong. Here are the basic points that I want to make:
1) In the Phantom Menace(PM), the cosmic war is CHRISTIANIZED, with Darth Maul looking like Satan! How incredibly shallow! Yeah, villians NEVER look like ""normal"" people in real life, right?! Please! Whatever happened to the concepts that really made you think, such as Luke going into the cave at Dagobah and understanding that what Luke saw as evil were really just components that he himself owned?
2) In the Empire Strikes Back, Yoda's home is on a planet that is nothing but a swamp which was meant to call your attention to the powers and mysteries of nature (where ""the Force"" comes from), but in the PM, Yoda lives on a planet that has wiped nature out and the Jedi reside in a Vatican-like Ivory Tower! I guess not EVERYONE has equal share of the force, just the SPECIAL HONOR SOCIETY ones do!
3) Anakin and his mother are Slaves on Tatooine, yet they live better than I do?!?!?!
4) Anakin yells ""this is INTENSE!"" while in the fighter at the end battle scenes. PLEEEZE! He also yells ""YIPPEEEE"" when his slavemaster lets him go home. Yeah, I really believe that these characters are so downtrodden by their lives as slaves. Lucas must have read ""Roots"" by Alex Haley before writing these characters (My eyes roll).
5) Lucas did not include any discussion about possible environmental/sociological/psychological elements making Anakin turn to the Dark Side. If Lucas did his research, he may have found that most tyrannical real-life despots come from majorly abusive or traumatizing childhoods. I guess Anakin's scars come from winning the Pod Race (My eyes roll again!). The storyline has a lesser social relevancy because of these dim-witted character sketches.
6) C-3PO was made by Darth Vader?!?!?!?!?!?!?! Imagine the odds!!!!!!
7) It is odd that with such a vast infinite number of galaxies, alot of what goes on in The Star Wars films take place on Tatooine!
8) Although the Star Wars films were nothing like the real-life war movies such as ""Full Metal Jacket"", they still had people getting tortured and killed in sometimes graphic scenes. Then all of a sudden, they decide to make these movies JUST FOR KIDS!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
9) I thought that the two main Jedi (played by Neeson and that other guy who was supposed to be Obi-Wan) were a bit too MACHO! Right before they both do the lightsaber fight with Darth Maul, they see him in the hangar and say something like ""Leave him to us!"" Like the audience is supposed to say ""Yeah, go get him! WOO HOO!!! KICK HIS DARK-SIDE BUTT"" This is not in keeping with the original understanding of the Jedi.
Well, that is all I can say now. If I were to talk more, I would only collapse in pure tragic horror over this baleful film! (...)
It has been a year since I have seen the film.  I decided to watch it again so as to see if my critique was adequate.  I found, once again, that my review was quite on target in many ways (if I do say so myself).  There was one crucial aspect that I had alluded to, but still grossly overlooked.  Thanks to another review which further pointed this element out to me, I now see further evidence of this film's flimsy structure.
What I am refering to is the scene at the end of the lightsaber duel after Liam Neeson's character gets killed by Darth Maul.  Obi-Wan then kills Darth Maul out of REVENGE (not self-defense).  Knowing from ROTJ that striking your opponent down out of anger and revenge leads to the Dark Side, why didn't Obi-Wan become evil? This is something that 99% of the audience never questioned.  In fact, most of the audience thought of Obi-Wan as the hero after killing Darth Maul (and it surprises me that this is how Lucas wanted the audience to react, I suppose Overconfidence is George Lucas'es weakness.)
So, Im sorry that many found my review to be unhelpful.  But these are people who I seriously DOUBT would be willing to actually discuss with me on an intellectual basis the EXTREME extent of how this film is flawed.
Ok, I feel better now.",1005782400,4,4281,4.6310935441370225
661568,2,6303454038,"Lucas certainly developed and used a whole horde of new CGI and other special effects technologies in the making of this; it's too bad that the story has so many holes in it.
The clear purpose of it is to introduce us to ""He Who Shall Become Darth Vader.""
Unfortunately, rather than creating a cast of characters appropriate to him, it ties huge amounts of the story to the ""future"" characters.  R2D2 and C3PO apparently knew ""Darth,"" as a boy, and he spent some ""quality"" time on Tatooine.  This makes the story of ""A New Hope"" make a whopping lot _less_ sense.  Darth Vader _knows_ the robots; he _knows_ Tatooine; he should even have some bittersweet memories of he and his mother living there.  Instead, in IV, he chooses to just _ignore_ all this stuff...
Another thing that _really_ irritates me is the whole ""Anakin's Mom"" part of the story.  After Anakin does so much to help out a Princess who RULES A PLANET, they can't imagine the notion of sending back a ""Galactic Express"" funds transfer to buy his mother out of slavery?
The waffling over whether Anakin should get trained seems pretty nonsensical, too; if the Jedi Council is so worried about him getting training, it would make sense for them to actually Do Something.  Maybe put him to death due to the danger.  (Pretty amoral, but we know, what with Parts IV-VI that he's going to kill a whopping lot of people, and help throw the empire into deadly chaos.  Nipping him ""in the bud"" would be pretty logical.)  Or even to just say ""We'll keep him around, at the Jedi Academy; he'll get a Special Training Course.""  (That would _actually_ amount to keeping him under guard...)
But instead they propose just tossing him away, right when it's clear that there are Dark Jedi Forces that would doubtless be _fabulously_ interested in such a potentially-powerful apprentice.
And the only way Jar Jar is at _all_ forgiveable is if he proves to be some sort of unconscious ""Drunken Jedi Master"" that hasn't realized who he actually is...",1005782400,3,1996,4.693409742120344

Disc one features a sparkling THX transfer of the film, or one should say ""data"", since so much of it was generated digitally anyway. Several scenes have been tweaked or extended, in true Lucas fashion, but Jar-Jar remains annoyingly intact.  The audio tracks astound with perfect Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX, and English and Spanish Dolby 2.0 tracks. Track four contains film commentary by George Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, Ben Burtt, Rob Coleman, John Knoll, Dennis Muren and Scott Squires. Burtt, Coleman, Knoll and Muren are most impressive, with Lucas and McCallum not really saying anything new.
Disc two provides a rare glimpse behind the scenes at Lucasfilm with hours and hours of footage, stills, deleted scenes and trailers. One caution for sensitive viewers of disc two is the fondness that Episode I producer Rick McCallum apparently has for the F word- all clipped of course to just ""f.."" - but most are obvious.  Included in the hour-long documentary ""The Beginning"" is a hint that several at Lucasfilm, including Lucas himself, may have had an early indication that the Phantom Menace was falling short of expectations by attempting to do too much, but strived to improve the picture right up until its theatrical release in May 1999.

661571,4,6303454038,"I love the STAR WARS series.  I had huge expectations for PHANTOM MENACE and was definitely let down.  Now that it's a few years later and the DVD has finally been released I still don't like the film.  It's not horrible.  The most watchable parts of the film are the final battle and the Senate scenes. For me, PHANTOM is successful in its effects, costume and set design, and political intrigue.  Lucas awed me with the Gungan battles and hooked me with his political intrigue. PHANTOM left me wanting more in the acting, story, and construction of the plot.
The bonus/cut scenes are interesting, but not revelatory.  I'd heard about the Greedo scene and thought that it read quite well in script form.  After seeing it on this DVD, though, I still believe that Lucas did a poor job directing his human actors and staging their scenes.
The effects in PHANTOM are incredible and the pod race is amazing.  However, if you don't care about the characters then you don't care how fast they are going and if they may crash!  (i.e. the ""Luke-and-Leia-on-speeder-bikes"" scene in RETURN OF THE JEDI may not have been as technically advanced as the Pod Race -- however, I actually WORRIED that they might get hit by a tree.  I can't say the same for Anakin in his pod.)
On a positive note:  The documentary on the 2nd disk is a lot of fun and illustrates how hard it is to bring these films to life.  The DUEL OF THE FATES music video is nice as well.  And the animatics are very interesting to watch.
I am a fan of George Lucas and believe that he was trying to push some bounderies on PHANTOM MENACE.  Every artist needs to grow and try new things (in his case: new technology). I also believe that he was still finding his ""voice"" after being away from directing for so long.  I have some hopes for ATTACK OF THE CLONES -- although not as high as my PHANTOM expectations.
I am grateful to Lucasfilm and Mr. Lucas for the DVD.  I think they've done a great job and as a long time fan of STAR WARS am appreciative.",1005609600,,2008,4.401084010840108

661625,5,6303454038,"Like many other 30something year olds, George Lucas was the author of all my childhood fantasies. I saw Star Wars Episode IV when I was 6 and was completely blown away. No movie has ever had the same impact on me. With the release of Episode 1, George Lucas had the daunting task of trying to recreate the experience we all had in 1977. There is no way this film (or any film) could live up to those expectations. I have chosen to view Episode 1 on its on merits and find it to be brilliant, wildly entertaining, and ground-breaking in its use of computer generated effects. The DVD is the best I have ever purchased. It provides a plethora of extras which are extremely insightful and enjoyable.

And it's not just Jar Jar. Take him out (yeah, dream on) and you've still got a slowish mishmash of unimaginative drivel. Sure, Anakin looks cute when he curls his lip during the pod race, but what of the rest? The best part of the whole movie - the Jedi-Sith duel - is short and not always well photographed.
The plot borders on idiotic. You have to see it for yourself (well, don't if you don't have to) to appreciate the understatement I'm using here.
Terrible plot. Yawn of a set piece (the pod race). Jar-Jar. What an amazing achievement, to have spent so much time and money to come up with this uneven, childish, silly movie.
It has its moments. It's fun to see Jedi slashing and jumping and kicking their way through the movie. But there's not enough of it to hide it's Ewok-type elements, such as little Anakin saving the day ... by mistake.
Great graphics, although some of the design could have been better, from the bland-oniony design of the Naboo fighters to the (yes) stereotyped aliens.
Aaargh!
It's hard to state just how bad this film really is. I didn't think so before I saw it again on TV. I actually taped it, but promptly reused the tape afterwards to tape the end of a Seinfeld episode (Jerry: ""What's mine is yours."" Kramer: ""Really?"").

This movie has SO many problems. bad casting, bad acting by the child stars, horrible characters like Jar Jar and Darth Maul. Under developed plot AND an over developed plot (only Lucas could screw up on both counts) He tries to cram too much into this movie. I mean what are the chances that Darth Vader built C-3P0. He totally killed the magic of the force and annoyed the heck out of everyone by having the characters over explain everything. Ant the worse thing, The fact that Lucas used toilet humor in this movie. The only good to come of this movie is the soundtrack, the podrace, and the lightsabre fight.

I myself enjoyed the first three, I used to have pretty much all the figures and ships when I was a little younger. (Currently in storage). To make a long story short, I didn't think this movie was that good. Sure it was one of the most hyped movie ever, but it didn't even come close to matching that hype.
What don't I like about this movie? Lucas tries to add more humor to it than the other movies. How many times is Jar Jar Blinks going to trip over something, knock something over and fall on his face? If I wanted to see type of humor, I would watch Comedy Central SNL and Chris Farley doing Matt Foley. I don't know what was more annoying Jar Jar Binks or Anakin. I don't blame the kid 100%, I think the writing was weak. He had too many speaking parts, plain and simple. I mean come on, he's out in space flying around. Ships are getting shot down everywhere and he tells R2 Hey let's do barrel rolls. Also what I really thought took away from the movie was all the ""dumb luck"" that happens. Jar Jar Binks screws up and takes out a dozen droids. Jar Jar screws up again, he takes out a few more. Anakin, flys into the control ship, just happens to fire the droids, hit's the control function for the droids. Also was it me or was the light saber fight very weak, especially how Darth Maul died. I give this DVD 1 star for the movie and 2 for the DVD. The DVD sounds pretty good, but IMHO there are other movies out there that sound just as good if not better.

However, this movie is best when viewed on DVD - one can cue past anything cringe-worthy and just enjoy the good parts of the film.  This is not EXACTLY the print that you saw in the movie.  Lucas, in finishing some of the deleted scenes, has decided that not all of them should have been deleted after all.  He includes more footage of Coruscant, which I feel is an improvement - any excuse to spend more time on Coruscant, the better.  Of course, this is a 2-DVD set.  There is no great need for this, all the information would have fit on both sides of one DVD, but then that would have cost us less money.

661683,5,6303454038,"The nay-sayers are smoking dope to tell anyone that this movie stinks!
 It rocks on every level. From the special-effects to the somewhat complex plot, Lucas aquitted himself nicely in delivering THE most anticipated movie-ever.
Here is my response to the non-believers who whined about ""Lack of character development"". They are just plane wrongo.
 The character development was in the foreshadowing of things to come. Episode 1 isn't a stand alone movie but part of a three act/film whole.
 Look at Star Wars. The only thing that really advanced was that Luke got his wish to get off the planet and do something. Solo kinda came around to help someone other then himself there at the end, which is about as far as a SW film as seen in the one chapter story arc department.
 You also didn't get to know Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars either.
As I said above, what the cry-babies are failing to distinquish is that Episode 1 is not a stand alone movie. Wait until the next two chapters are out before you whine about a lack of character development.

Another popular complaint is: ""Who was Qui-Gon and why was he used more instead of Obi-wan?""
Who Qui-Gon was is illrelevant cause he isn't the main character of Episode 1. Anakin Skywalker is. Only the realities of the story forced Anakin's debut to happen at the 30 minute mark.
But one could say that Anakin dreams of being a champion, someone who mattered, did begin to come true. And the seeds were planted between him and Padme, as well as the soon to fester clash between him and Obi-Wan.
The characters to keep an eye on are Anakin, Padme, and Obi-Wan. Maybe Yoda to an lesser extent.
Again, foreshadowing.
- Anakin behaved as he did because Lucas was again setting up how much he will change over the next film leading to his downfall. Scenes were deleted showing his inner rage and hatred (as witnessed firsthand by a poor child aged Greedo).
Lucas was simplifying the naiveness of youth.
""Jake Lloyd and most of the acting was bad.""
Wrongo!
It was no better or worse than in the original trilogy. I thought Neeson was excellent. He gave Jinn a quiet nobilty and grace.
 Rules should not be apllied to TPM if they are not going to be applied to the original films. . Outside of two ""Yippies,"" Jake Lloyd did just fine, especially in the final moments between him and his mother. And all eight year olds act like that.
 Star Wars movies have never been about acting. Just look at the post SW careers of Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. This is not Mamet or Shakespeare!
""But why did it have to pander to the kiddie element so much?"" First off, these films HAVE ALWAYS been aimed at the kids. They are kids movies and that is straight from Lucas's mouth.
 Oh, like Star Wars and Return of the Jedi didn't pander to kid's humor with all the fart and burp jokes. Let alone all the times where Chewie started acting like a scared puppy or R2 was shocked or shot for comic relief.
 If those things are so annoying go watch (***) like ""The Matrix.""

Another yawn-inducer. ""Jar Jar was pointless! Why was he in the movie?""
 In every great quest story there is a friend, sidekick, etc who is there along for the adventure but has no emotional connection to the goal because he/she doesn't understand or believe in it. Usually, they end up being enlightened.
 I gurantee all of those idiots who complained about Jar Jar will be crying in their seats, just like when Spock croaked, when he dies a heroes death in Episode 3. His goofiness just shows he has a character arc in store.
 Lastly, the most popular and annoying complaint.
""The Midi-chlorians de-mystified the Force.""
 The whole Jedi myth thing was never looked into in Episode's 4, 5, and 6. Search your feelings, you know this to be true. The only place that it was explored in were the countless mass market tie-in books that you dumbasses bought en mass.
 Besides, there are two more movies to go, be patient and see where he takes it.
Anywho, forget the stupid critics, they always have a self-serving agenda to push anyway and wouldn't know a fun movie if it bit them on their bums!

When George Lucas made the original movies in the late 70's/early 80's, he was a serious filmmaker. He approached movie making the same way someone like Francis Ford Coppola or other serious directors did. The only difference was that the subject matter of Lucas' films(outer space adventures) was usually the fare of lousy B movies. In the DVD, Lucas continually reminds of special effects shots that were impossible to do in the originals. It seems almost as if these technological constraints forced Lucas to focus on such things as plot, character development and witty, sharp dialogue. During the commentary,one of the F/X guys chimed in about how much CG scenery was packed into each frame. Maybe thats the problem. In the originals, the focus was narrowed on the characters.  We got a real sense of who Han Solo and Luke Skywalker were and what they were about. In the Phantom Menace, they were so concerned about making fake things look real they forgot what was really important to movie fans.  It really makes you realize how long ago it was since the original trilogy came out.  I almost wish Lucas didn't wait 16 years to make this movie.

The whole thing felt forced and disjointed with the known Star Wars universe... just a flashy showing of digital effects.  But worst of all is the child actor - and I use the term loosely - playing Anakin.  His utter inability to emote even a quasi-convincing whoop of joyous victory overshadows any annoyance I may have felt at the infamous Jar-Jar or the cheap army of Binks clones for the last battle scene.

661720,4,6303454038,"One doesn't get far into the maze of extras on ""Star Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace"" before figuring out that George Lucas and his co-workers made this DVD as much for themselves as their audience. Lucas' glee is evident as he introduces a handful of deleted scenes, all completed at significant expense for the DVD edition. The missing footage is, of course, every bit as good as what remained. But the real treasure here is the insiders documentary ""The Beginning: Making Episode I."" Director Jon Shenk had all-areas access to the production process, including casting, rehearsals, set and model building, filming and post-production. On disc, ""The Phantom Menace's"" CGI effects seem more focused and believable, with fewer blue-screen disconnects. The small-screen treatment somehow seems to amplify the movie's appeal to children. The thrilling Jedi knights martial arts scenes, however, lose much of their impact compared with the theatrical presentation. Colors are vibrant and stable, with deep-space blacks, dazzling whites and nary a speck or a sign of wear. The Dolby Digital 5.1 EX mix keeps all speakers jumping, especially the subwoofer. Rear sound effects are active and more playful than on most discs, but still tend toward the predictable. The lack of DTS option will disappoint many audiophiles. (Other downbeat note: There is no option to mute Jar Jar Blinks.) Lucas and some of his key collaborators provide a commentary track that's heavy on effects and light on humans. Easter eggs yield a blooper reel, deleted scenes from the deleted scenes docu (!) and a few outtakes. All in all, an essential for ""Star Wars"" fans.",1004659200,5,1645,5.164794007490637

I rushed to see it and after the movie was over I sat there wondering ""What the heck was that?""  It was terrible.  The whole story was ment to run on effects instead of a story line.  Though it did follow the story I feel as though much of it was thrown together just around the computers and what they can do.  The guy with the long ears (sorry don't know his name) was compleatly anoying and though he was there to be funny he was FAR from funny.  Why does he need to be there?  In the original Star Wars, there were no chars. added just for comic relief.  They were funny on their own.  I am not even sure if I will waste my time on the next one.

The DVD has some really nice features, particularly alot of the bonus material that was added.  Still, some of the menus are so filled with flash that it slows down getting to what you want to see (For example rather than give you a good decent list of the deleted scenes, you have to view the name of the scenes one at a time).  My biggest gripe is the fact that Lucas changed the film on the DVD so that it is different than the one on VHS or appeared in the theater.  While the additional scenes were nice, a DVD that does not explicitly name itself as a director's cut should at least give the viewer the option to see the film the way it was originally presented (for an example of how that is done very effectively see the Abyss DVD, while I much prefer the Director's Cut, it is nice to be able to see the original).",1004572800,,931,4.155555555555556

What would have happened if there would have been no Jar Jar?  No one would have known about the Gungan's grand army and they could have never taken back Naboo.  The point here is obvious - everyone has value and potential.  Qui-Gon saw something hidden that Obi-wan and the rest of us were ready to overlook. (. . . )If we are big enough to overlook minor flaws in people we may discover some real intelligence and value.  That's what is so great about this movie, to really enjoy it, you have to alter your own views a little and look past your own bias and preconceptions and develop some genuine tolleration.

It boggles the mind how Lucas worked from nothing to being able to build this incredibly realistic universe complete with intense sub-plots and stories.

661726,4,6303454038,"""Phantom Menace"" was much maligned when it came out, largely because it wasn't ""sophisticated"" enough.  Well, the originals featured some incredibly ham fisted acting too, we were just younger then.  The fact of the matter is, ""Star Wars Episode I"" is a highly entertaining, visually spectacular movie.  I can guarantee that you will not find better CGI elsewhere, and the story line, while somewhat obtuse, has great pacing and is fairly engaging, even touching at points.  Moreover, the acting is probably better than in the originals.  Liam Neeson and Ewan Macgregor are accomplished actors in their own rights, and Nathalie Portman and Jake Lloyd proved themselves to be burgeoning talents.
As for the DVD, I was pretty much blown away.  The sound and picture quality are literally without parallel.  I have never appreciated the technology of my home theater system more than when I first popped in this DVD.  To put things in perspective, my dog was actually walking from speaker to speaker, trying to figure out who was talking!  The picture is brilliantly sharp, and the included THX tool assures that your levels are properly adjusted (assuming you feel like going to the trouble of using it).
The extras are pretty standard, but no less enjoyable for that fact.  George Lucas' commentary offers some interesting insight into the film, both in its creation and its final form.  The cut scenes from the pod race are spectacular.  Although far too long to include in the body of the movie, they are immensely enjoyable to watch.  It is important to note that it is not an option to view these scenes within the movie, as has been suggested by other reviewers.  Some of them are included in the movie, as well as some extended transition scenes, but the viewer has no control over which ones.
All in all I found ""Phantom Menace"" to be a highly enjoyable, if not particularly deep movie.  Moreover DVD is the perfect format for such an effects charged, popcorn movie, and the creators of this DVD did not miss.  It is loaded with extras and proved to be an enjoyable way to pass an evening.
Enjoy!",1004400000,2,2102,4.7972222222222225
661727,5,6303454038,"Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace is probably the most misunderstood sci-fi/fantasy movie in recent history. Why this movie recieved so much negative response is beyond me. I thought this was a truly spectacular film. And I'm not just saying that because it's Star Wars,(although that is a contributing factor)but because it is not just another it's-science-fiction-so-just-gimme-the-money type movie, although that's what many people said it was. Also because we returned to that galaxy far, far away and learned more about it. We have new characters, new enviroments and a whole new story.
Many complaints have surrounded this movie since it's release. Let's look at some of these,(there is nothing negative that anyone can say about this movie that I can't defend against.)
1. The story. I once remember George Lucas saying that a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing. Well, I wasn't at all bored with this movie so there must've been a story there somewhere.
2. The plot. This movie did something different when it came to the plot. It was several different subplots rolled into one. Qui-Gon's training of Obi-Wan, Amidala wishing to protect and save her people from the Trade Federation, Anakin's discovery by the Jedi who realize how strong he is with the Force, Senator Palpatine's rise to power which will lead to the downfall of the galaxy, the first meeting between C-3PO and R2-D2, Shmi's desire to let her son go free and fulfill his dreams, the rise of the Sith who finally making their move to conquer the galaxy, and the eventuality that Obi-Wan will train Anakin. I think it would be difficult for someone other than Lucas to tell so many stories in one movie. This is probably what led to the confusion of what the plot actually was to others. But that's just my theory. Anyone who want's a quick and easy version of the plot. Senator Palpatine(aka Darth Sidious)used the Trade Federation and the problem they presented with the trade route taxations. He would then have them blockade Naboo which would allow the Queen Amidala to overthrow Chancellor Valorum and Palpatine would take over, therefore moving his Sith plan into fruition. Valorum then sent two Jedi to try and negotiate a settlement. You can easily figure out the rest. I agree that this could've been clarified better. But altogether I liked the idea.
3. The acting. Well I hate to admit this, but Star Wars never really had great acting. It had good or at least decent acting. I felt this had the same feeling as the other movies.
4. Jar Jar Binks. Ah, yes, the underappreciated Gungan. All right, I can actually see why a lot of people didn't like him. But I'm not going to yell at you about it. I'll just say that I think he's awesome and not annoying. Probably because I'm not easily annoyed.(Not with movie's anyway.)
5. Anakin Skywalker. He didn't bother me one bit either. I mean come on, he's just a kid, remember he's not going to stay like that forever.
6. Too kiddish. Yeah, I can see that too, but this didn't bother me either. I say, hey, give George a break. This was his last chance to make a happy Star Wars movie. Remember that Episode's II and III are going to be a lot darker.
7. Too much visual effects. Well, can you imagine how impossible it would be to do most of these sequences in live action? Exactly.
8. The midichlorians. This is probably the most misunderstood element of this movie. Let me explain what it is. This just proves that not everyone can use the Force and become a Jedi. The more midichlorians one has within him, the stronger that being is with the Force. This is how Qui-Gon was able to determine that Anakin was the chosen one.
9. Character development. This is probably the only thing I think that could've been improved. I would've like to have known more about Qui-Gon's past. The rest of them I think we're fairly developed.
Now that that's out of the way, I hope many of you look at this movie with a better viewpoint now. But even if you don't like the movie, I still suggest you pick up the DVD and watch ""The Beginning"" documentary. It may not drastically change your perception of the movie, but it will show that it's more than just a two hour toy commercial as many people say it is. Trailers, TV spots, deleted scenes, documentaries, animatics, commentaries, pictures, DVD-ROM and easter eggs galore. This is NOT a DVD to be missed.

Having seen the original Star Wars Trilogy a few hundred times, I can truly admit that the movies get worse and worse with each viewing. What puzzles me is the lack of good acting in all of these movies.
In Episode One, truly the worst is that annoying kid portraying Anakin Skywalker. Hopefully, he will be banned from film making and find himself a real job. The script is so bad and so unoriginal, even a good actor like Ewan Mcgregor had trouble making his part believable. Which brings me to the worst part of this movie: the incredibily racist sterotypes. Don't believe me? In the opening scene we have the rat looking, broken english speaking, conniving Chinese aliens. Then we are introduced to a unintelligent, ebonics speaking, minstrel Jamaican. Of course there's also the flying, cheap Jewish Alien shopkeeper, with the giant nose included.
George Lucas and Company may have created the most expensive piece of trash in American film history. While the special effects were stunning, the ignorance portrayed in this movie was what truly amazed me. The sad saga of commercial America continues...",1004313600,5,1195,4.862745098039215

The special affects were definatly cool, but what happened to the story?  I was really unhappy that they took several characters from the original trilogy, and made them look like jokes.  For instance: Greedo, the Sand People, and mainly Anakin Skywalker.  I HATE it when a character saves the day by pure accident.  Anakin just happens to end up in the right spot at the right time, and accidently hits the right button that saves the Universe.  And don't even get me started with Jar-Jar Binks, the Pod Race Announcer, and Jar-Jar Binks clan leader.  Although the computerized characters were really cool to look at, sometimes it felt cartoonish, and I didn't feel like they meshed real well with the real actors.  I missed the way the characters were in Star Wars, like Chewbacca, and the various faces in the Mos Eisley's Canteena.  One of the cool things i loved about Star Wars in the first place is because I felt like I was in the movie, experiencing the adventures right along with Luke, Han and Leigh.  Their world didn't seem that different from mine, but Episode 1 just seems too fake and less REAL...and it doesn't take itself seriously at all.  I know there are a lot of Star Wars Fanatics out there grinding there teeth at my review, but please don't get me wrong, I love Star Wars and I loved certain scenes in this one, but It just didn't live up to any of my expectations.

Not only that, it comes with a second disc that has a lot of features  like the making of the movie, deleted scenes (which will probably be added to the movie in twenty years as a ""Special Edition""), and others, which are really fun to watch.
I imagine the movie has been reviewed over 10,000 times so I won't even bother. All I have to say is that Star Wars Episode One is a great, entertaining movie. So, those who had this movie on VHS, buy it on DVD to re-experience the quality in audio and video.",1004140800,,795,4.0

While taking us into the making of film, we also got to see the theatrical trailers (the teaser I liked the most), as well as interviews with the cast and crew. Now in terms of the story and the characters themselves, I really did like the story format, and how Anakin Skywalker begins his road to the dark side of the force. It does mimic the other Star Wars movies, but in a way it makes you really think of the paths these characters have or will take. It's also very much the case of what George Lucas would have done with the previous movies, if he had the digital technology back then.

661787,5,6303454038,"Like most ""Star Wars"" fans, I have been eagerly awaiting the release of ""Star Wars"" -- any ""Star Wars"" -- on DVD.  The wait is finally over and it was well worth it.  This DVD is, without question, the best DVD yet.  The picture and sounds quality is outstanding (those who complain about the DVD not being available in DTS sound must remember that is only a matter of preference as many like myself think DTS to be much ado about nothing), but the main reason for getting the DVD is the specieal features and brother does this have special features.  The enumerous items on the second disc include deleted scenes (including a few I wish had been included in the original film) not to mention the single best behind-the-scenes documentary I've ever seen (called ""The Beginning"").  The usual DVD toys are here such as all the trailers (including the ""Tome Poem"" TV spots) .  The only things missing are more stuff with the actors and an all-music track (a terrific DVD special feature that is too sparingly used by studios).
As for those who continue to gripe about ""The Phantom Menace"" as a film, I'm sure the vast majority of their population are of those who watched the film only once.  I, too, was disappointed by the film when it first came out; it was good, but not ""Star Wars"" good.  Then I saw it a second time and discovered it was better than I remembered.  Then came a third viewing, then a fourth and a fifth as it became better each time I watched it.  It is certainly not the best of the four movies, but the film grows on you as it as the hype from the film's release as well as expectations vanish.  With no hype and a familiarity of the story, your eyes wander to the amazing costumes, effects and set design as it becomes easier and easier to ignore Jar Jar Binks' more annoying traits and accept him for the amazing visual effect achievement he is.
If you've seen the film only once because you didn't like it, I recommend renting this DVD and I think you'll have a change of heart.  If you do like the film, BUY IT!

Since George Lucas was filming Episode II about a week after Episode I hit the theaters, he held off on releasing the DVD because to him it wasn't finished yet.  He has added back more to the movie in DVD format than was seen on the screen or the original VHS release.  Now there is much more of the pod race scene.  There is also an air-taxi scene which gives a better look at what Korasan (spelling may be off) looks like.  If your a fan of Star Wars, it's a must have.  Some people aren't sure they like the prequel idea.  But the fact is, this story is and always has been meant to be shown as a 12 hour (singular) movie.

661829,2,6303454038,"I bought this DVD mostly because I love the first 3 movies and remembered thinking this one was okay when I saw it in the theater.  Watching it again, I could not believe how painfully slow this movie feels or how bad most of the dialog is.  The movie opens pretty strongly with the Jedi knights on a diplomatic mission that quickly turns ugly.  It was a pleasure to watch Jedi knights on screen at the peak of their powers after watching Luke struggle to learn the art through the earlier films.
Unfortunately, the movie starts to go downhill quickly once they land on Naboo.  The introduction of the infamous Jar Jar Binks is only one irritant as the story bogs down in an incredibly lengthy attempt to escort the queen of the Naboo back to the homeworld of the Republic (ironically, they scarcely get there before deciding to return to Naboo, making the whole thing an even bigger waste of time).  Virtually the entire time spent on the desert world of Tattooine crawls by as improbable event after improbable event is inflicted on us.  Young Annakin is impossibly wise and mature to the point that it seems almost bizarre when he is around other children quite some time after we first meet him.  His character is an adult part acted out by a young boy.
The battle with Obi Wan and Qui-Gon attempting to handle Darth Maul is entertaining to a point but badly tarnished by the two of them constantly (and uselessly) twirling around in circles between blows.  This is done strictly for drama to prolong the fight.  All the twirling allows Darth Maul to block both of their light sabers and battle them to a standstill for some time.  If the fight were filmed realistically with 2 Jedi attacking from opposite sides at full speed he would be dead in 10 seconds.
Without belaboring every flaw of this film (there are far more), suffice to say that this is for hardcore Star Wars fans only.  Anyone who is simply looking for an entertaining film can find far better elsewhere.",1004054400,,1975,4.582386363636363

It's got all the special effects and production values money can buy, and there are some outstanding action sequences and very imaginative creatures but there's something missing and I think I know what it is:  heart.  I just don't think Lucas's heart was really in this.  I think it was an obligation, a financial one and one to the fans.  I don't sense the utter thrill and joy of pure moviemaking I did from the original trilogy.  Nothing happens here that gets the hairs on the back of your neck up, or gives you goosebumps or rouses you out of your seat.  I wish wish wish Lucas would entrust the next two segments to outside writers and directors.",1003968000,6,848,4.432258064516129
661834,3,6303454038,"It seems that George Lucas and crew must have been thinking ""Wouldn't it be cute if?"" thousands of times in making this movie.  Its almost more Barney than Star Wars.  Unfortunately it takes alot of the seriousness out of the movie, and pushes aside what could have been more interesting plot issues.
Who is the Trade Federation?  Why has the Senate approved their taxation of trade routes?  Why is the Trade Federation blockading Naboo?  None of these questions are answered, other than maybe its all part of Darth Sidious' plan.  The story doesn't even establish the level of respect that Palpatine should have in the Senate.  Instead we get answers to questions like ""What would happen if Jar Jar stuck his tongue in the power coupling on Anakin's pod?""
Despite my complaints about the movie, it is now part of Star Wars.  The light sabre duel is amazing, and the pod race is fun.  The special effects are great.  But the story leaves alot to be desired.
Star Wars (not episode anything, but the original 1977 movie) is still, and probably always will be my favorite.  It is the only movie in the series that can completely stand alone.  It also took its story very seriously, which is what really drew the audience into the picture.
As far as the DVD itself, it looks great, EXCEPT, the folks at THX used way too much edge enhancement in many scenes.  This will make no difference to those who do not fully understand the quality benefits of DVD, but to those of us who know, the halos around characters heads, and other high contrast objects are very annoying.  I suspect this is a result of using the same master for the DVD as was used for the VHS tape.
For those considering purchase, the DVD is available for less elsewhere, so shop around.",1003881600,9,1749,4.581993569131833

He nearly RUINED the film. A few scenes could have been incredibly powerful were it not for him swaggering around with his floppy ears filling up half the screen. But I prefer streetbrawls.com There are even people who have taken the time to make Jar Jar hate sites! A total goof ball... agh... I can't go on writing about him.",1003881600,,484,4.449438202247191
661877,5,6303454038,"I'm reviewing only the DVD, and not the movie itself, which was a bit of a stinker, in my opinion.  Well produced, beautifully filmed, but very poorly written.
Anyway - this is an awesome and incredibly well done DVD.  Lots and lots of extras.  Great commentary by Lucas, the producer, the sound man, etc. Interview with the composer.  Lots and lots and LOTS of background materials on the making of the film, and the entire process of putting it together from initial writing to final production, and the making of the DVD itself.
The image of the movie is *very* crisp and clean.  The deleted scenes are a nice addition to the movie.  I am very impressed (and surprised, to be cynical about it) that Lucas has given us the full-featured DVD the first time out, and not offered us one scaled down DVD version, only to offer us a better version in a year, and then the full-scale one a year after that, like he's constantly done with the VHS versions of his movies.  Thank you, Lucas, for taking care of your fans this time, and not trying to pad your pockets a few times before giving the fans what they *really* want.
Quality-wise, this is absolutely one of the most loaded, best-featured DVDs I have in my collection.
(as a p.s. - after hearing Lucas' commentary, and talking about some things coming up in the next movies, I have realized that a few things I criticized about this movie actually make sense oin terms of the upcoming story-line. However, I still think that, overall, the writing for this movie was only a cut above old b-movies)",1003881600,73,1548,4.546762589928058
661878,5,6303454038,"I'm not giving this five stars because it was a good movie...it wasn't.  I'm sure everyone has thought or hear about how annoying Jar-Jar is (though not as bad the second time I watched it); the pod-racing was way too long and the announcers were too ""modern"" (sounds like Mel Allen doing the play-by-play); the actors playing Anakin and his mother are wretched (I don't know what was worse, their acting or their dialogue); shameful use of things such as fart and feces jokes; and Darth Maul is *seriously* underdeveloped as a character.  The odd thing is that the five minutes of the final showdown between the Jedi is great filmmaking, the rest is Lucas playing with his ""toys"".  What made the original trilogy great is that it was your classic Arthur legend, set in space, and done so in a manner that it worked on several levels.  Kids loved the battles and special effects, adults could enjoy the plot-twists and the progress of the characters.  None of this happens in the Phantom Menance, it's ""dumbed down"" to the lowest commmon denominator and if it had been truly the first movie in 1977, the series would have died.  The DVD however is what DVD is all about.  One disc has the movie with special features such as commentary and such, the other has mini-documentaries, photo and video galleries, etc.  Nicely done.  What scares me is watching the deleted scenes...because the movie could have been worse.  The pod races could have been even longer than they were, the Jedi and Jar-Jar could have been threatened by falling over a waterfall for no reason when they arrive at the Naboo capital, etc.  Bottom line, DVD:  Five Stars; Movie:  Two Stars at best.",1003881600,,1667,4.706896551724138
661879,3,6303454038,"George Lucas is hard to figure.
Examples of George's senility: the Gungan leader, Anakin's flying hook-nosed slave lord, Yoda, the Trade Federation baddies, and of course Jar Jar (who's so far out ahead in first place that he almost makes everything else moot).
Examples of George's brilliance: the visual effects on the whole (the feeling of expanse, whether in space, on Coruscant, out in the open, underwater...it's all breathtaking), the fight scenes and choreography (absolutely spectacular), the action scenes (pod race, space battle, etc.).
And unfortunately, this trend isn't entirely new to this movie...if you watch the originals again, you'll see that senility gradually creeping up, starting with the Mos Eisly aliens in IV and culminating with the Ewoks in VI.  I wish Mr. Lucas would just recognize what works...he has 4 of these babies under his belt already.  But no, even in the face of as large an outcry as could exist against Jar Jar, he's still insistent on including the character in the next film.  I hope it's for good reason considering what a detrimental effect the character had on this film...if Jar Jar isn't a pivotal part of the upcoming plot, then his inclusion will be practically the equivalent of George flipping off his fans.  Anyway, lose the attempts at cutest aliens, and give the visual effects team and choreographers a raise, and we're three-quarters there.  Have I mentioned how jaw-dropping the saber fight scenes are?  (I hope Ray Park can be given more Star Wars work...his athletic talents add immeasurably to those scenes!)
On the subject of the DVD, it does have some of the highest quality on the market...both the presentation and the sheer value of the extras is incredible, especially for such an amazingly reasonable price.  I'm not much one for extras in general, but the ones on this disc (like the deleted scenes...incredible!) make a very strong argument.  A sincere bow to the Lucasfilm for the value it offers fans with this DVD.
Here's to hoping Episode 2 (my potential favorite of them all, synopsis-wise) finally meet's this franchise's incredibly high potential.",1003795200,,2126,5.07163323782235

(3 movies every 20 years, not to shabby.)  This DVD set gives great insight into a fantastic world and the man who created it. Hopefully he will do justice to the original trilogy on DVD at some point...",1003795200,,487,4.47191011235955
661882,5,6303454038,"It's unfortunate that the reviews for the DVD of TPM are included with the reviews of the movie itself.  So much new material has been included on the DVD, it's practically a different product from the VHS version.  The television ads aren't lying when they say this baby is the ""new standard in DVDs"".
I've reviewed a lot of DVDs specifically on their extra content and never have I seen one where every feature was so compelling.  Lucas is a master at slightly retooling his works every few years to drain every bit of money he can out of his loyal fans, but this time he gives his audience a full meal which augers well for the DVD release of the other films in the series.
Most obviously, there's the filmmakers' commentary.  Like the movie itself, there's almost too much information happening at once to catch it all on the first viewing.  If you have any interest at all in the filmmaking process, you'll find yourself rewinding over scenes to hear everything that's said.  In some ways, it could be argued that the commentaries of all the participants should've been separated out into more than one track.  The most obvious choice would've been to have a director's/editor's/producer's track distinct from the producer's track, but that's a very small quibble indeed.  There are very few who won't think the track given is compelling and, in some cases, actually plot-amplifying.
But it's really disc two that provides the most content.  You'll spend a good five or six hours mining for treasure, here.
Some of the material is familiar to those who followed the development of the film for years on starwars.com.  There, a series of web documentaries were created at various stages of the film's progress to keep people interested.  Now, they comprise a nifty historical record.  Tackling the film from every angle, they give you in-depth understanding of the various challenges posed by lightsaber battles, costuming, visual design and casting.  For those of us who followed the development of the movie regularly on starwars.com, there's not a great deal which is new here.  But even if you logged on to starwars.com every day, you'll be glad to have this collection offline.
Likewise, the trailers and tone poems are things fans will have seen many times over, but they're rendered here in more splendid quality than is available on the web.  Particularly significant in this section is the music video for ""Duel of Fates"".  While this has long been permanently available on starwars.com, it received little bandwidth priority there.  Oddly, this was only available in a very small size with unimpressive audio.  Here, it's preserved better than I remember it on MTV.  Instead of just being an exercise in directorial creativity, it neatly edits together scenes from the creation of the movie and the film itself,.  It's worth pointing out that the collection of television spots is by no means exhaustive.  But the most significant ones are here, especially the emotionally effective tone poems.
Still, the one thing that fans and non-fans will want the most from disc two is the hour-long documentary.  Without narration, it provides raw video from various phases in the production.  You see many relatively unguarded moments which range from those that help you understand the enormity of the filmmaking task,  to those which give you a new appreciation for the bits of the film that annoyed many viewers.  You will definitely start to see this film as a beginning of a larger tale, not as merely a film unto itself, and this will doubtless increase your appreciation for it.  Indeed, what this excellent documentary does best is to capture the struggle of making this film, which, despite having the famous first trilogy as a point of reference, was every bit as revolutionary as, say, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARVES.  More than that, though, you'll see the very human side of the filmmakers as they go through moments of daunting frustration yet miraculously never seem to lose their innate enthusiasm for their craft.  It is reason enough to buy this DVD.
What most hard-core fans will buy this DVD for, though, is first access to the trailer for Episode II.  Through online links, DVD owners are given first crack at the upcoming feature on a special site that will, apparently, be constantly updated until the release of ATTACK OF THE CLONES.  If you care about getting the very latest official information from LucasFilm, you're going to need this DVD.
Unfortunately, this opportunity is not available to Macintosh users.  Indeed, it painfully points out the only failing of this DVD. The special features are not Macintosh-friendly.  No Mac user can get to the special DVD web site.  And many are reporting problems even mounting disc two.  This DVD, too, contains a large number of ""Easter Eggs"" (hidden, coded features), almost none of which are accessible on a Mac. If you can only watch this DVD on a Mac, I suggest you go to macfixit.com for full reports on steps you may have to take to get the most out of this purchase.  It's ironic that there are such problems for Macs, since Macs were used extensively in the production of the film itself.
That aside, there's not much to complain about with this DVD.  LucasFilm has done right by its fans and its critics, giving even casual viewers plenty of cause to revisit that galaxy far, far away.",1003795200,,5372,4.864835164835164
661883,4,6303454038,"I may not have thought this was my favorite Star Wars movie, but it definitely has a lot worth enjoying.  This DVD actually helped me like the movie better and is overall an outstanding DVD that lets you escape to the Star Wars universe for a while.
DISC 1
First of all, the movie is presented in beautiful anamorphic widescreen and is crystal clear.  It's a great demo piece for your Home Theater system both in terms of visuals and sound.
The menu system is something different than ever seen before because it features 3 completely different menu themes based on the locations of the movie.  You can actually choose which menu you want by pressing 1, 2, or 3 during the first warning screen of the DVD.
The commentary track during the movie has great insights and, I felt, was one of the more interesting commentary tracks I've heard.
DISC 2
This disc contains the bulk of the many special features.
The deleted scenes were great to see, but even better was the fact that so much work and money was actually put in to complete the effects for them.  As if that's not enough, there's a short documentary explaining what went into the deleted scenes and how the creators felt about leaving them out.
By far my favorite part of the disc is a professionally made, outstanding documentary entitled ""The Beginning"".  It makes you feel as if you were a fly on the wall during some of the most interesting parts of the process to make this movie.  For example, you get to see the scene when Ewan McGregor got to pick his lightsaber for the movie and hear how excited he was about it.  This documentary has humor and characters you care about watching.  It is one of the true gems of this disc set for sure.
Disc 2 also contains 5 specially made featurettes, and all 12 of the great web documentaries on the making of the film.  It also has the famous trailers and TV spots, as well as a making of the video game Starfighter.
There are also additional Easter Eggs (hidden treasures) found throughout the disc that haven't even all been discovered yet.  One, for example, shows some hidden outtakes from the movie.  To get to it, go to the Options menu on Disc 1, and enter on your remote ""11"", then ""3"", then ""8"".  Depending on your system you may have to press enter after each number.
This only begins to get into what's great about this DVD.  Overall, this is one DVD I am glad to own and I give it my highest recommendation.",1003795200,,2422,4.4401805869074495

I wanted the movie to take me on an emotional journey where I cared about the characters I watched and felt their feelings as they displayed them, but watching Phantom Menance I felt nothing.  I felt like an outsider watching a film without meaning, watching battles that I didn't even care who wins.  I hope Lucas stops production on Star Wars II.

I still say the Terminator 2 and The Abyss packages are best.  Lucas was wise to load up this DVD with hours of extra stuff, because otherwise he would simply be cheating us again.  There is a large enough number of people who agree that this movie was a major disappointment on ALL levels.  All the fancy digital effects on earth cannot cover up for a bad script and stiff acting.

My advice to you is to ignore the Jar Jar Binks haters. What they don't realize is that Jar Jar is a technological marvel, worthy of his own documentary, and he is one of the most complex effects elements of the entire film. Jar Jar is motion-captured brilliantly with a performance by Ahmed Best, and George Lucas tells us in the audio commentary that the inspiration for Jar Jar was Buster Keaton, particularly in the Gungan battle against the battle droids. So, there is much more to Jar Jar's character than these haters would have us believe.
I was a bit thrown by the fact that Lucas added some of the deleted scenes to the actual film instead of keeping them separate. Otherwise, why not call this a ""Special Edition?""
All in all, it is a dazzling use of DVD technology, with TONS of extras that will keep the most die-hard Star Wars fan busy for hours and hours. I know I'm still not done with the extras, and it's been a week since I've bought the DVD.",1003795200,3,1259,4.650224215246637

I've witnessed the emotional return to the theaters for the re-releases and all the updates on video and was there opening day for Ep. 1 and when it came to video. Now George finally gives us a Star Wars film on dvd and it looks amazing! Thsi Film looks so amazing that Jar Jar actually looks pretty darn good and that says alot right there! This is what dvd's are for and finally we have  Star Wars film on dvd. Now let me get to what bugs me and it has nothing to do with the actual dvd. The people who call themselves fans are greedy! Of course they've re-released the orginal trilogy quite a few times (the 1st time was with new sound and picture quality-the box set with yoda/vader/s.trooper covers)then they released a box set of the special editions and then they re-released the special editions just to clean some of the stuff up, add a ep. 2 teaser (which had many complaining but still had people whining) and put it back into print (the special editions were out of print as was the original trilogy)there are so many box sets because the movies continue to go out of print (it's like disney films...they go out of print and are hard to get a hold of until the re-release-dumbo is being re-released once again soon)george has nothing really to work on with all the re-releases and has been focusing on ep. 2 full time since the end of ep. 1 so it's not like he's sitting in front of a t.v. each day watching soaps...the guy is busier than most of the complainers! it really makes me mad to hear people complain about the original films on dvd and want them now but george plans on taking his time with those and adding all the cut scenes...which will take time (the special editions took a few years themselves)george can't do everything at one time and it makes me mad to hear people and see people acting so foolish and imature over this. If you want a rushed dvd without good looking bonus stuff (trust me the original trilogy dvd's will blow this one away because so much stuff from those films has yet to be seen in on a screen)you'll be mad when you get it and still complain that george didn't put any effort into it! it takes him over 2 1/2 years to make 1 film and he's busy 24-7 for those years so it's not like he has the free time (of course when he does it's with his family)plus...george really didn't have much to do with the ep. 1 dvd. Sure he threw in his input but it's not like he focused on this one 100% (that's why i'm sure there will be a even better ep. 1 when in 2005-2006 when the original trilody hits dvd!)Be happy he gave us this and didn't wait until after he was finished with ep. 3! George has gave us more than any other filmmakers have ever have given us and still people want more and more! It's sad!

I am a big fan of DTS, and always buy DTS whenever it is available, but this is the best Dolby Digital soundtrack I have ever heard.  It makes tremendous use of the surrounds, and gives a very spatial feel.  The center channel seems a bit underutilized at times, but it is not terribly distracting.  Secondly, the picture quality is also very, very good.  It looks as good as anything I have ever seen, and is very sharp and fluid.  Finally, the extra features alone make this disc worthwhile.  There are lots of neat extras and some pretty cool hidden features as well. Overall, this is an excellent reference DVD for showing off your system.

661988,4,6303454038,"Let's get this out of the way: the deleted scenes are NOT worth buying this DVD.  Each of the deleted scenes deserved to be deleted from the movie, whereas other scenes everyone wanted to see (such as Qui Gon and Maul fighting on the ramp of Queen Amidala's ship) are never even hinted at.  (In case you didn't know, the scene I just mentioned takes place when Qui Gon jumps up to the ship after scuffling with Maul on Tatooine; in the original, he's followed by Maul, where another melee takes place on the ramp with Qui Gon giving Maul a force push after Maul tries to Tomahawk Qui Gon, a move Maul later gives to Obi Wan that leaves Obi Wan hanging over the energy reactor shoot in the final battle).  Of all the scenes to include, Lucas gives us more Jar Jar!  WHEN DOES THE HURTING STOP?????
Okay, now that I have that out of my system . . . it's a good DVD.  Even after watching it, I'd still buy it.  If tradition holds, the second movie of the trilogy will be the gem of the series (we all know Empire was what made the first Star Wars trilogy what it is today), which means there's still hope of redemption from Jar Jar.  I say: keep the faith.  Like A New Hope (the very first one), The Phantom Menace will hopefully prove to be a ""warm up"" for Lucas for better things to come.",1003708800,,1287,4.182186234817814
662064,5,6303454038,"I'm so tired of hearing how bad this movie was. If people thought the movie was so bad, why did they buy the DVD?
Anyways...
I bought this DVD because I'm a Star Wars fan and I liked the film. Was it as good as it could have been? No. Was it bad? No. I saw it eight times in the theatre and a few times since. I can't say that about many films.
As far as the quality of this DVD goes, it's fantastic! Where the film may not have lived up to expectations, this DVD certainly does. The picture and sound quality are top notch. The lack of DTS is not missed. Fans should know that Lucas is about THX not AC3. The disc even has a great feature that helps you optimize your sound for THX on 7 channels. I doubt anyone that has complained about this has even listened to the disc.
Certainly the extra features are welcomed and well done. There is an hour long making-of documentary. Every trailer and TV spot is included as is the music video for Duel of the Fates. One of the best features are the seven deleted scenes that Lucasfilm went back and finished for this DVD including a whole additional lap for the podrace.
There are also some overlooked features. Most people think of the menues as an after thought, but this DVD has the best menues I've ever seen, and there are 3 different main menues that randomly load each time you play the DVD so it's not always the same. There is a DVD software viewer for watching DVDs on your PC. I found this software to actually be better than the one that came with my player.

You really have to see how fantastic this DVD really is. I got mine for $17.99 which was more than a bargain. You most likely have already seen the movie, so that shouldn't be the question. As to how well the film was adapted to DVD format, there should be no question.",1003622400,,1893,4.174863387978142
662065,5,6303454038,"For so long, many Star Wars fans have wondered when a DVD version of any of the Star Wars episodes would be available for sale to the public.  There have been rumors that no DVD release would be made for ""Star Wars"" until the next two episodes are completed.  Of course, this angered many Star Wars fans.
But when the word came out months ago that a release was in the works, one could not imagine that the ""Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"" DVD would be setting a standard for DVD's in jamming what they could on two DVD's and giving fans more than what they have expected.
First, let's talk about the movie.  The movie is provided via anamorphic Widescreen with an aspect ration of 2:35:1.  The movie looks beautiful and the audio utilizes English Dolby 5.1 Surround EX.  Did I say the movie looks beautiful?
Now, the second DVD.  I don't know how long it will take me to finally view the complete DVD because it's jam packed with featurette's, deleted scenes, documentaries and much more.
One thing is that there are some deleted scenes I wish they added in the movie such as one deleted scene featuring the green bad guy known as Greedo (who was in the fourth Star Wars episode/first movie) and the Web documentaries galore which include the ""Bad Droid Karma"" which features the difficulties of making R2D2 work.
If there was one nitpicky feeling that I had for this DVD was that it didn't feature the movie in DTS.  I'm wondering if we are going to see a ""multiple version"" like the videos of the Star Wars series was released to the market.  But I'm still pleased with the Dolby 5.1 Surround EX.
Although not my favorite ""Star Wars"" in the series, the DVD is just plain awesome and I'm just hoping if they release the other episodes on DVD, that the others can measure up to this one.
An amazing DVD giving new meaning to ""jam packed"" when it comes to special features.",1003622400,,1882,4.466472303206997

But for the truely skeptic my words won't matter as your minds have all ready been made up.(hee hee) The deleted scenes part i thought could've been longer. I mean 7 scenes you would think would last like a half an hour or somewhere about that. There are some pretty cool features on this disc. The sound and picture quality BLOWS AWAY the video cassette!!!! The begining feature was pretty cool and interesting. My only other complaint is just Jar Jar is truely ******* annoying. Also enjoyed the mini interviews with cast. Not to give away anything but Ewan M.(Obi-wan) has one of best lines in the ""making of"" feature...Overall it has my seal of approval and should at least quench the thirst for other star wars dorks...",1003622400,,789,4.642857142857143

The extra features are so numerous it takes your breath away. I spent such a long time exploring it all and playing with it. There are so many extra features you could write a book. My favorite feature was the deleted scenes. It was SO much fun. Actually most of the deleted scenes were added on the dvd version of the movie except for a few. The only thing I didn't like about the movie itself was Jake Lloyd the actor who played Anakin. I know he needed to have similar features to Luke Skywalker but I think they could've found a better actor. His facial expressions never cahnged. He had the same expression on his face when he was happy, sad, scared, or bored. But after all he was 9 or younger when they started filming so I guess I shouldn't be to hard on him. Despite that I still give it 5 stars. I'm going to wait for Episode II to come out on DVD and skip the VHS version. If I absolutly can't wait I'll just rent it. George Lucas, if you read this, please don't wait to bring 4-6 out on DVD until after number 3 is out. That would be horrible. Actually I doubt us fans will allow that to happen. Anyways PLEASE bring them out on DVD soon!!!",1003622400,,1278,4.075396825396825
662070,4,6303454038,"What's to complain about?  This DVD has just about everything: excellent picture quality, sound, and state-of-the art effects work.  The special feature disc is loaded with documentary material and deleted scenes.  Nevertheless, some of the acting is pretty bad (Jake Lloyd in particular), and the dialog is lame in spots.  Certainly these were gripes I had about the theatrical version, and I still went to see it twice!  The extra footage added to the DVD version does make it noticeably better.  I just hope George and the gang make an effort to rein in the more maudlin elements in Episode 2.
In my mind, the best ""Star Wars"" episode overall is ""The Empire Strikes Back (aka Episode V)"", displaying excellent acting, visuals, and plot.  The cornball stuff took a back seat; it would be great to see at least one of the first three episodes come close to it.",1003536000,,861,4.738255033557047

First, if you're going to believe the events took place before the others, you don't use 2-dimensional (and extremely ""computerized"") computer-generated characters, spaceships, etc. You use physical, tangible, 3-dimensional models and do not surpass the effects - which are STILL spectacular - of the first three. Nothing new here. Same types of characters, same action sequences, and an extremely overdone score by John Williams. What it boils down to is that everybody has a prime. George Lucas has waited too long to try and hold on to and re-create his glory days. BOO! to The Phantom Menace. Just pretend it was never released and enjoy the original trilogy in its original prints. There's nothing new here.",1003449600,3,833,5.087591240875913

662155,4,6303454038,"We all know what the flaws are in this film--a poor script, plot holes, annoying alien sidekicks, etc.--but this DVD goes a long way towards redeeming it. First, the print. Excellent transfer--the landscapes and visual effects leap out at you, and one can now really appreciate the sheer inventiveness of the special effects. The sound is also good, but--as another reviewer pointed out--there are better sound production techniques. Lucas usually goes state-of-the-art with everything he does; why not the best here? Still the sound isn't bad; one can FEEL the pod race as much as see it, and the landscape of Tattooine blends seamlessly with the pods and the various effects. Ben Burtt proves he's one of the best sound technicians around--every racer has a unique and--more importantly--appropriate engine sound (Check out the menacing noise of Sebulba's pod, for a good example--doesn't it seem to fit him?). Yes, the sound could be better, but it isn't bad.
Now, for the added scenes. They're confined to two segments--the pod race, and the arrival at Coruscant. The pod race scenes involve extra character introductions (unnecessary) and additional racing segments (excellent). The latter add some truly hair-raising moments to the already tense and exciting pod race, and are welcome. The scenes at Coruscant mostly involve Anakin and company traveling through the city. It's nice, and the effects look great, but it really adds nothing to the film.
Now, the extras. This is what makes the DVD one of the best produced to date. Each segment is carefully scripted and directed, with some real standout moments, plus a few revelations. Watch the ""3000 Anakins"" segment and realize that Jake Lloyd wasn't a bad selection after all. Even an average actor can be redeemed by a good director (see Jim Carrey in ""The Truman Show""), but Lucas was probably so wrapped up in the technical aspects of the film that he seemed to forget that in the middle of this monstrous production was a small boy with minimal film experience. Perhaps that's why Lloyd sometimes seems a little apprehensive. Give the kid a break, folks.
Perhaps the only real disappointment came in the lack of actor commentary in the extras. Neeson's a great personality; I'd love to hear what he has to say about his experiences. But Lucas and company have loaded the second disc with everything else (and maybe the kitchen sink, too!). ""The Beginning,"" the documentary about the film's production, is absolutely first-rate. One may begin to believe that one of the reasons the film suffered from plot problems is that Lucas was so distracted by all of the various crises that seemed to pop up daily (remember--much of this was filmed in the Tunisian desert, where you should expect the unexpected). I'd seen the ""Duel of the Fates"" video when the film was first released--excellent then, excellent now. The storyboards and animatics segments are nicely detailed and reveal how much work can go into a single scene. There are more extras--posters, trailers and teasers, plus the DVD-ROM features. They're all first-rate, as well.
The film has many flaws--but remember, Lucas made the original for a different audience. He called this film ""'Star Wars' for his kids,"" (a paraphrase) and it does have many redeeming moments: Does anyone else get chills at Palpatine's last statement to Anakin? The lightsaber duels are hyperkinetic, dynamic, and well-choreographed;  the pod race runs on pure adrenaline, even more so with the additional scenes; and the battle between the Gungans and the Trade Federation's robotic troops is stunning in its complexity and flawless effects. Can anyone find a flaw in the film's effects? I haven't. Great production design is also an asset. Jar Jar may annoy the heck out of most people, but he's still an amazing breakthrough in digital effects; same for Watto, who steals every scene he's in (""Mind tricks don't work on me; only money!!""). Ditto Ian McDiarmid; his Palpatine is an ambitious, manipulative political genius who oozes both charm and evil in the same breath. Not a great film, but still better than most of the cookie cutter movies Hollywood produces every year. To those who don't like it: Give it another chance. The second time I saw it in the theatre I was accompanied by a seven year old boy, and I enjoyed more than my first viewing. Those who are already fans will love this wonderful DVD treatment.",1003363200,3,4418,5.002717391304348

Particularly of note is a nice and long documentary about the making of star wars.  People who have seen a lot of DVD extras will probably attest to the fact that ""making of"" documentaries on dvds are usually 5 minute hype segments.  This is not.  This really gives you a feel of the work and effort put into the film, and makes you appreciate what being a director is like.

The documentary of the deleted scenes and the making could be a stand alone title.  I would recommend that non-Star Wars fans watch the original trilogy again, then come back and watch Episode I.  You will then relieze the importance of this movie in the great Star Wars Saga.  I still feel that Lucas should have release the original movies before this one.",1003363200,,698,4.448818897637795

Episode 1 in all intensive purposes is the first installment of a saga. In all other cases, the beginning isn't as good as the other movies in a saga. Take Star Trek The Motion Picture. I think that the main reason that most people didn't like the story of Phantom Menace is that they know the rest of the story. The climax of the saga is known. In every movie the beginning 30 minutes is used to establish characters.
Anyway, The DVD is the best package Iv'e ever seen. I have seen all that there is on it and I can't wait to get home and watch it again. If you are a Star Wars fan you can't pass this up.",1003363200,,736,3.97972972972973

I wasn't going to write a review but I noticed that many of the reviews here were gripes about the movie itself or gripes about the lack of DTS, etc.  Some reviewers hadn't even viewed or listened to the DVD yet!  Well, my answer is this: this DVD will make a ""Phantom Menace"" fan out of you.  It is, by far, the best DVD in my collection.  The audio, even lacking DTS, is reference quality.  Get your 5.1 HT setup cranked up and watch the lightsaber battle and you will not, repeat WILL NOT, believe your ears.  I am a big fan of DTS (even to the point of buying DTS DVDs over the more extra-filled non-DTS version), but believe me when I say that you cannot tell that this track is non-DTS.  Its is that good!  In fact, this audio track is better than ANY DTS disc (better than Gladiator, Saving Private Ryan!)
And man, the extras are unreal!  The documentary is alone worth the price of the disc.  Its is the best documentary I have seen on disc (only the ""Hamster Factor"" from 12 Monkeys is even close).
In fact, I think this disc is so good that even if you were less than happy with the movie, you will be pleased with your purchase.",1003363200,,1205,4.195652173913044
662161,4,6303454038,"I recently received my copy of the Phantom Menace DVD and am quite pleased with it.  I must say that the sound quality of the DVD is really quite amazing.  The sound and picture quality and special effects alone are worth the price of the DVD.
Despite the strengths of the special effects, I must say that the script and the acting are extremely weak at times during the movie.  For example, little 5-year-old Anakin Skywalker hits on the Princess at many times during the movie.  Those scenes are extremely unrealistic.  I just find it really hard to believe that little brat would flirt that much with the adult princess.
Also, Anakin Skywalker simply cannot act.  That boy basically reads his lines without much emotion.  I think that the little kid from the 6th Sense would have played a much better Anakin Skywalker.
What genius decided that it would be a good idea to have JarJar Binks in almost every scene?  I do understand that JarJar is supposed to provide comic relief.  However, JarJar is not funny at all - he's just really annoying.
And what's the deal with the Jedi blood test?  Why could they do this at the time of the first episode, but not at any time during episodes 4-6?  Was the technology simply lost?  It doesn't make any sense to me.
However, despite the script and acting weaknesses, the film is still much better than most of the movies churned out by Hollywood today.",1003363200,,1395,4.580645161290323
662274,5,6303454038,"The deleted scenes were great.  I think the fact that the sound is THX more than makes up for the fact that the disc is not DTS.  I think Lucas will not do a DTS version.  As for the commentary by the director.  This is worth it's weight in gold to see the true ideas behind the Menace.  The making of the movie featurette was awesome.  I think if you bought this movie soley on the merits of just the movie, you should just keep the VHS version.  DVD is a spectacular way to deliver not just the movie, but also the thought process behind it.  I was extremely pleased with this.  I think anyone who really takes the time to rip it apart because it was not the movie you wanted to see when it was first released in theatres, will be more than pleased when ATOC is released next spring.",1003363200,,785,4.1118421052631575
662275,5,6303454038,"Say what you want about ""The Phantom Menace,"" but one cannot deny that the new DVD version is absolutely the best DVD package produced so far in the relatively short history of the medium. Lucas kept telling us he wanted to wait to do this on DVD until he could get it right, and he did.
What's so great about this DVD -- aside from the very good picture transfer and the perfect soundtrack -- is that it truly shows what it takes to make a movie of this magnitude from every stage and facet of production. There are 20 documentaries here -- yes, 20 -- capped off by an hour-long, narration-free video diary of the production that tells everything you need to know about why ""TPM"" turned out the way it did.
So why did ""TPM"" turn out the way it did? Well, it's simple: George Lucas expected too much from too many people in too short of a time. Luckily for him, many of those people delivered -- John Knoll and ILM, Ben Burtt on the sound design, and John Williams in particular. But George overlooked one thing, and that was simply the performances. The shoot was done in 13 weeks, and, as the docs show, he often only took 2 takes. This is with actors on stages covered floor-to-ceiling with blue screens, acting against sticks with ping pong balls on them for animator reference. George simply rushed the shooting of this film so that the techies could have more time to make it look and sound as jaw-dropping as it does.
And maybe that's okay. At heart, ""TPM"" is, after all, just a space opera, a movie that's supposed to make you ooh and ahh. And it does that. The visual effects are the best anyone's ever seen, sometimes purely because of how many of them there are. Damn near every shot in the film contains an effect of some kind, and the result is a picture so rich with visual detail that it really is quite impossible to take it all in.
Of course, the picture does have more than its share of flaws. Jake Lloyd. Jar Jar Binks (in performance only; the visual creation of Jar Jar amounts to a near-miracle). Natalie Portman's very lop-sided performance. So much going on that we get confused. Some directing mishaps.
But none of that really matters. What matters is that George Lucas simply proved with ""TPM"" that there are no more barriers in the visual effects world, nothing that cannot be done. As a technical achievement, ""TPM"" must rate among the greatest in the history of film; as drama, it must rate very low.
Thanks to this DVD, I understand why this is the case. And I thank them for putting it together. This is the definitive DVD, a veritable film school in a box.",1003363200,,2588,4.427672955974843
662276,4,6303454038,"This movie ain't as good as the ESB or ROTJ, but in my blasphemous opinion, its better than A new hope.  Simply because the original star wars special effects were so horrible that it was funny.  In my book, special effects come before story in star wars movies, and the special effects in A new hope look like they cost 1.50 plus some stolen cardboard.  At least by ESB and ROTJ, the special effects were believable.
  Back to phantom menace, the story was average and all the other usual complaints, but the most important thing was that I was entertained.  Even if you hate it, you will still buy this DVD, because George Lucas owns us all.",1003276800,,643,4.452991452991453
662277,4,6303454038,"First off to those out there who are surprised or disappointed that there is no DTS version. Three little letters can answer that THX. THX is Lucas own sound, why would he produce a DTS version when what he wants is more people using THX. It doesn't matter whether DTS is better or not.
  The Phantom menace is still plauged by a poor script, poor directing and at times poor acting. The special FX are of an extremely high standard, as well as some new innovations.
  The DVD etras are very cool and worth it. The movie isn't trash. It just is not as good as it should have been. The DVD is well worth the money. And a good edition to your DVD libary.",1003276800,,652,4.192

However...If you're like me and grew up on the original trilogy as a kid, you are in for a lesson that you missed due to the first three films being so ingrained into our culture.  As movies...well...they're not that good...It took me about five minutes into this film to to realize that the script dialogue was terrible.  Plus, In an attempt to please all of the people, he brings in idiotic characters like Jar-Jar.  Enough has been said elsewhere about him, and I will give no further opinions lest I be though a racist.  however, I bought the DVD, though I will seldom, if ever watch it.

Yes, I will admit that Jar Jar is annoying, but so was C3-PO when the original trilogy came out.  The true charm to this film is the explaination it depicts of many unanswered questions that the films and books have created.  From the actual incarnation of creatures and aliens that our minds eye has not been able to create to the explaination of how Jabba the Hutt gained his power. (and what a female Hutt looked like)  This is what this trilogy is intended to do.
On top of that, Mr. Lucas and company did a fantastic job casting this film.  Everyone from Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did a fantastic job playing the noble characters of an age in which the chivalrous order of the Jedi were the elite of the galaxy.  Young Anakin was portrayed fantastically...he was portrayed as a kid...exactly what he should be, and exactly what Luke was in Episode IV.  Overall, this is a film about introducing characters and explaining an unknown universe to a populace that already knows the ending and Mr. Lucas and company did a fantastic job!",1003276800,,1231,4.589041095890411

And check the bit rate it averages 8.5.  Now I just bought 2 superbit movies and the bit rate is also in the 8 area.  The sound and seperation are great but still not DTS.  Cannot figure out why a picture and sound so good would leave off that option, as only 2% of people hae a certified THX sound system set up???  What Lucas reaaly need to do is FOLLOW HBO!!!  There is no way they can fill in the story and give enough time to Anakin changing to Darth, and Obie Won and all inbetween in just 2 2hour movies.  Also if this is the past, well it looks more technical to me than 70 yrs later when Luke is 18.  So they should make it like the Sopranos or 6 feet under with 10-14 1 hour episodes and sell it as a 4 disc set with a DTS option.  Someone please give this idea to Lucas.

If you have a home theater, be sure to access the THX Optimode feature in the Languages/Subtitles screen to make your video and audio as clear as you can.
However, like others I fully expect this release to be the first of many DVD releases of Phantom Menace. My only wish is that this one had a 'Phantom Edit' option to minimize Jar Jar's screentime.
One other thing: the probe droid sequence on Disc Two should never have been cut out. Yes, we saw the droid fly by as Qui Gon was talking to Watto after the race, so we know they'd been found, but this sequence made that work better, and explained why in the next shot Anakin was tired like he'd been running the whole way.

The last time I got excited like that was after standing line with my father for an ETERNITY to get tickets to see Return of the Jedi.  Not the re-releases, mind you.  I'm talking 1983.
For those who already own the VHS and wonder if the DVD is worth picking up - ABSOLUTELY.  The visuals this DVD produces are just astounding.  It is the cleanest, prettiest transfer I have seen.  Sound?  I don't have DTS, so I don't know what I'm missing with that.  What I do know is that it is the best Dolby Digital 5.1 sound I have ever heard.  The Podrace and my sub get along great, and yours will too...
The disc of extras is great, with ""the making of"" being my favorite extra.  To see what they were shooting with an actual camera, and how it ended up in the end is remarkable.  The deleted scenes are also interesting, and they refer to something I wish had been on this release.  They say the Podrace was originally 25 minutes long!  I wish they would have put that together and had it to view in all its glory on the Special Features disc.  Oh well, like Lucas is only going to release this once...and this is going to be the only version...right?
Anyway, I wholly recommend this set.  It's a showpiece for your home theater system, it's loaded with extra features, and (most importantly) the movie is a lot of fun.

662392,4,6303454038,"I for one think that Star Wars Episode I was a good film overall.  A lot of people were expecting the second coming when this film was being made, and when that impossibility didn't materialize, hated the film.  I think the film serves as a good introduction to the epic of Star Wars.  The acting can be uneven (but it was in the original film), and the story is a bit slow to move - but it sets the stage for the grander story very well.  The DVD edition is excellent - the commentary is interesting - and even the deleted scenes are presented in anamorphically enhanced widescreen.  Spread over 2 discs are enough features (documentaries, trailers, etc) to keep anyone busy for hours on end.  An excellent edition that sets the standard for future Star Wars episodes on DVD.",1003276800,,776,4.507142857142857

The only reason why I had 4-stars is b/c it seems there are 2 parts in the picture that the screen flickerd and messed up in video (no its not my dvd player).

I was dissapointed.......
Picture quality was washed out, and black level was more grey than black.  Many scenes exhibited edge enhancement
Sound mix was not the best I've heard, and the dialog level was very low compared to the other channels.
Probably looks good on a regular TV, but on my 90 inch screen and THX sound system, it was so so.
Still enjoyed watching it though.  Lets hope the other episodes are an improvement in quality",1003276800,,640,4.756756756756757
662395,5,6303454038,"Well, I've read and heard all the ""Lucas bashing"" ever since Episode I was released in 1999, and I think it's really a childish waste.  Sure, Jar-Jar was annoying to some, but I liked him.  He provides the ""comic relief"" that the two droids had in the original trilogy.  I think Jake Lloyd did a great job, and didn't put in a ""cardboard"" performance like he's been accused of doing.  My God, the kid is only 8 years-old, give him a break!
I loved the lightsaber battles, space battles, the visual effects, and performances. Sure, Darth Maul was drastically underused.  Maybe we'll see more of his race in Episode II or III. After seeing it now on DVD, the perfect format for my FAVORITE series of movies, you get to see it the way Lucas meant it to be enjoyed.  After watching all of the extras and ""making of"" specials, you see how hard everyone worked for almost five years to make this movie.  I guess my only regret about the DVD is why not just include all 7 of the deleted scenes into the movie itself.  The only one included is the brief ""Coruscant Taxi"" scene.  That's it.  But then Lucas explains that including them into the movie would have slowed it down, etc.  Now, with Episode II coming next summer, and Episode III in 2005, I'm as pumped about Star Wars as I was when I saw the first one when I was 7 years-old in 1977.  These movies have made a deep impression upon me, and my life.  So, I guess from what I hear from Lucas that all six Star Wars films will be on DVD after Episode III in 2005.  That's fine.  This is his life's work, and I'm proud to be a Star Wars FANATIC! I can wait for them.  Maybe not patiently...but I'll wait knowing they're on the way to DVD!",1003276800,,1686,4.254716981132075

The plot is critical to the prequel trilogy and will set things up for the events in episode 2. I love this movie because of the political chaos, the way Palpatine manipulates everyone, and the Jedi's fight with Darth Maul which has to be the greatest action scene ever filmed. The effects are top notch and the scenery on Coruscant was amazing, extremely well done. Aside from the movie, the new scenes and documentaries are worth the price alone. Outstanding, a look into Lucas' world. This dvd is packed with features and extras that make it such a great entertainment value. 5 stars don't do it justice.

662497,5,6303454038,"Say what you will about Episode I, the fact remains that it's simply a fun, fun movie. Fans expecting to relive the magic of the original trilogy are bound to be disappointed, but that's really a pretty lofty demand. Those films have had twenty-odd years to insinuate themselves into our collective pop culture psyche, and there is NOTHING Mr. Lucas could have done to satisfy the expectations of the fans who literally grew up with Luke, Leia, and Han. Taken on its own merits, though, Episode I is an absolute blast... a throwback to that magical era of cinema that gave us Star Wars, Indiana Jones, E.T., Close Encounters, and so forth. Just relax, quit complaining, and enjoy it.
With that out of the way, let me just say this DVD release of Episode I is absolutely excellent! The movie itself, provided on disc 1, looks incredible... the clarity of the picture will make even the most die hard cynic appreciate the tremendous effort that was put into the stunningly detailed backgrounds and characters; and the sound, needless to say, is AMAZING. This is Lucasfilm, after all...
It's the second disc, however, that makes this DVD a must-buy. There is SOOO much wondeful bonus material on here that you'll be stuck for hours trying to digest it all. There's a wealth of trailers and TV spots, including the music video for John Williams' thrilling ""Duel of the Fates."" There are seven complete deleted scenes, with an accompanying in-depth documentary, including a step-by-step walkthrough of the creative process behind the waterfall sequence. There are countless featurettes and documentaries, and an absolutely fascinating hour-long making-of film entitled ""The Beginning"" that's virtually guaranteed to give you a whole new respect for Episode I and the work that went into it. You may even feel a  twinge of grudging admiration for Jar Jar Binks... On top of that, there's a really nifty little multi-angle storyboard/animatic/film comparison, and even a few hidden goodies for the diligent viewer. All in all not a bad deal for a measly twenty bucks or so...
Look, if you have any interest in Star Wars at all, this DVD belongs in your collection. Put aside your petty grumblings and go buy it now... I think you may be pleasantly surprised to find that Episode I is not nearly so bad as you had convinced yourself it was. Plus, if we're very, VERY good, maybe Mr. Lucas will eventually grace us with the originals on DVD... Mmmmmmm....Star Wars on DVD.....",1003190400,3,2467,4.88782816229117
662498,4,6303454038,"Consider George Lucas's $4 million investment in bringing the Phantom Menace to DVD an apology for the oft-maligned and poorly directed Episode I, and you'll feel better about adding the double-disc to your collection.  Even though the film and story have severe shortcomings (David Letterman joked during its release that the line to get into the theater was two hours long, but the movie was so bad that the line to get out was three hours long), you cannot ignore the value of the extra material that is included.
Disc one features a solid THX transfer of the film, or one should say ""data"", since so much of it was generated digitally anyway. Several scenes have been tweaked or extended, in true Lucas fashion, but Jar-Jar remains annoyingly intact. The audio tracks are nearly perfect with Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX, and English and Spanish Dolby 2.0 tracks. Audio track four contains film commentary by George Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, Ben Burtt, Rob Coleman, John Knoll, Dennis Muren and Scott Squires. Burtt, Coleman, Knoll and Muren are most impressive, with Lucas and McCallum not really saying anything new.
Disc two provides a rare glimpse behind the scenes at Lucasfilm with hours and hours of footage, stills, deleted scenes and trailers. One caution for sensitive viewers of disc two is the fondness that Episode I producer Rick McCallum apparently has for the F word- even in front of children- all clipped of course to just ""f..."", but most are obvious.  My opinion of McCallum, already low, fell considerably after watching the discs.
Included in the hour-long documentary ""The Beginning"" is a hint that several at Lucasfilm, including Ben Burtt and Lucas himself, may have had an early indication that the Phantom Menace was falling short of expectations by attempting to do too much, but they strived to improve the picture right up until its theatrical release in May 1999.  Unfortunately, they came up short.
So thanks again, George, for all the extras on the DVD. We'll be watching, and hoping for something a lot better with Episode II.",1003190400,,2070,4.959654178674351

First off, the actual movie has some extended scenes which fit perfectly with the book detail.  Secondly, the deleted scenes, while few, are some of the best deleted scenes I've ever seen on a DVD.  If your a fan of the book, you'll find that most of the added stuff is right out of the book.  Such as an extended ""Pod Racer"" scene and little bits and pieces elsewhere in the movie.  But it just blows me away to see all this new stuff added to an already huge movie.  It was worth the wait as they say.
I've yet to see everything this DVD has to offer but the mere fact that I can state that makes me wish more DVD's could add up to this awesome release.  But in the end all I can say is that this could be the best DVD release yet.

It's very clear to me that Lucas want's to hook a new generation between five and ten years old tha probably don't know anythig about the previous movies. The ponit is.

662504,4,6303454038,"The Phantom Menace was probably the most heavily anticipated movie in history.  It was the prequel to the original Star Wars series and George Lucas was taking the helm as director for the first time since Star Wars in 1977.  The film was hyped incessantly and, of course, the final product failed to live up to the expectations.  The Phantom Menace is not a bad film.  It actually is absolutely amazing to look at and the special effects are incredible.  The problem with the film is the plot.  It seems disjointed as it bounces around from scene to scene.  It seems that Mr. Lucas was to preoccupied with getting the film to look right than the actual story (which is what made the first Star Wars so great). Many people weren't happy with the casting of several roles, especially Ewan MacGregor as Obi Won Kenobi, but he does a decent job in an undeveloped role. Liam Neeson is commanding as Qui Gon Jin and Natalie Portman is quite good as Queen Amadala.  The biggest complaint that most people had with the film was with the character of Jar Jar Binks and I won't disagree with most of what's been said about the annoying character. Mr. Lucas has previously shunned the DVD arena (American Graffiti is the only one of his films to appear in the format), but he goes about this release with a vengeance.  The extras, including seven deleted scenes, are worth buying this DVD alone.

662506,4,6303454038,"I've read other reviews, and people are saying they're impressed with these discs, which makes me wonder if it's just me...
I've looked at the movie and the special feaures disc, and I'm convinced my movie disc doesn't play as well as the same shots on the demo disc. The colours are weaker and the whole image is often fuzzy or lacking in contrast. Obviously the problems are of a minor order, but I've got a good quality player and TV and this is not normally a problem. (This is a Region 2 disc I'm talking about - but they're usually even a bit better than R1 discs.) Has anyone else noticed a less-than-perfect transfer?
I expected something in the order of ""Gladiator"" or ""Charlie's Angels"", both of which look much better on my system (please somebody tell me it's not just me).
The fancy menus were nice to look at but tedious in operation, with too much waiting for your very ordinary request, and why shouldn't you be able to directly select audio channels?
The commentary was obviously going to be very ""corporation"" with this such a new, important product. Not so much of the insider information, and lots of G. Lucas' monotonous voice, most of the time making you understand just how hard it was to make the plot work. He seems pathologically unable to say that he has ever changed his mind about the plot since 1977. Perhaps he does this unconsciously to keep intact a feeling of myth about the story. However I agree with another reviewer in finding the introduction of the ""midi-chlorian"" theory for gauging who was ""strong with the force"" to be very anti-mystical.
I quite expect commentaries, like reviews, to be monotonous, so no surprise here. One should be grateful that these guys bother at all I suppose. The others on the team do fill in some technical details which are of interest.
As far as the extra scenes are concerned, they all seemed good and the pod race now plays better than ever.
One final niggle. Don't wait till the end of the movie credits or you'll have to switch off your player to stop the copyright notices playing. Do they really think this serves any purpose other than to perpetually annoy people? Zero out of each ten million consumers has read a single word of them, ever.",1003190400,,2220,4.594458438287154

662590,4,6303454038,"For some reason, I received this DVD several days before the issue date, so when the weekend TV promotions for it claimed that it would set ""the new standard for DVDs,"" I was qualified to nod my head in total agreement. In fact, nothing in my DVD collection matches the quality of this superb product. It is a great transfer in every respect, and the extras are mind boggling.
Unlike most people who will buy this DVD, my viewing of it was also my first viewing of ""Star Wars I - The Phantom Menace,"" because I never caught it when it was in the theaters. I had read and heard all the negative reports, though, countered by some enthusiasm from diehard Star Wars fans, so my expectations weren't very high as to the story. My expectations as regards the visuals were very high, though, because of trailers that I had downloaded from the Net, and this DVD did not disappoint me.
I'm sure that seeing this movie on the big screen would be much better. It always is. But even on my 17"" Sony computer monitor (set for anamorphic, full resolution) the visuals are lavish and astonishing. The pod race and the climactic battleground scene look so real ... well, they look real! Incredibly real! Even when paused and advanced a frame at a time, the pod race action looks like the real thing. In the real world, objects racing past a camera lens produce a blurred image that is more blurred the closer to the camera, less so as the distance increases. In order to be convincing, animation must do the same thing. The sorcerers at ILM have done this to perfection, combining real images and computer generated ones, matching surround sound to the action, and giving us so many simultaneous tracking movements our heads begin to spin, as though we are riding one of those wild, carreening ""pods"" through the jagged stone walls and screeching over the desert race course.
But enough about ""special effects"" (I hate that phrase). What everyone seems to carp about most is the story...and the actors, especially the young actor chosen to play Anakin Skywalker. More about the story in a minute. Let's talk about the boy first. I admit to long being mystified as to why this particular youngster (Jake Lloyd) was chosen. In the previews I had seen, he seemed dull, uninspired, almost disinterested. Viewing the actual film, I was of much the same opinion at first, but he did start to grow on me. It was only later, on viewing the multitudinous ""making of"" documentaries on disk 2 (see especially ""3000 Anakins""!), where his auditions can be compared to those of two other boys, that I began to realize that he had actually been an excellent choice. What, then, is the reason that his on-screen performance seems at times so lackluster? After viewing this film, I firmly believe that the true culprit was sloppy and careless directing, not this inexperienced nine year old boy. In many of the peeks we get into the actual filming sessions, there seems to be an attitude of ""let the kid be himself,"" with apparently the first take often being accepted as good enough because he's satisfyingly ""unpredictable."" This not only seems to have been the case in the direction (or lack of it) of young Lloyd, but in many of the scenes that did not include him. Having seen the kid's audition, I believe he was probably capable of delivering a great Anakin, but he was rarely if ever challenged, coached, or directed to do so. Result -- mediocrity that is by no means the kid's fault. He was only nine, so the fault must lie with the adults, and it plainly does. Jake's performances are by no means the only wooden ones in this movie.
Now to the story: I didn't fathom it, but this incredible flick is so entertaining in all its many other aspects, I really didn't care. In truth, I'm not a Star Wars fan. Never have been. So when that mob of oddly dressed wooden characters began babbling about Senators and treaties and Federations and other such mish-mosh, I gave up, relaxed, and just enjoyed the music and the backgrounds. A second and third viewing of SW-I will probably begin to clear things up for me -- but really, the action itself is so appealing, an actual story would seem almost an impediment to the enjoyment of this visual and sonic tour de force.
If you're a Star Wars fan and know the basic story and all the characters, then you will pick up on that aspect of things a lot quicker than I did, and will enjoy this movie again and again, I'm sure. But, from my point of view, it is a tribute to George Lucas and all the immensely talented people who gave us this treasure, that a detailed story isn't really all that necessary. For the casual viewer, just having a rough idea of what's going on is enough. The pure visceral experience of SW-I is worth four stars alone, and that's what I give ""The Phantom Menace.""
Technically, though, the DVD transfer is a solid 5 stars. In terms of bang for the bucks, it's off the scale!",1003104000,113,4917,4.5633484162895925

I waited sixteen anxious years for the release of Episode I, only to leave the theater feeling as if I had just had a bad dream. What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said before? Oh well. I 'll do it anyway. The screenplay, if you can call it that, is simply terrible. The dialogue is nearly impossible to listen to, the ""story"" is virtually non-existent. I don't think Lucas even know what kind of a story he was trying to tell. The dialogue exists only to string together the obviously fake, cg effect sequences. The special effects in the original looked better. There is virtually no character development, and as such, no character about whom you care in the enitre thing. A potentially great cast is literally wasted by Lucas in favor of his digital effects. The whole thing is bascially a video game that you watch, rather than play. The ""story"" if you really try to follow it, or make ANY sense of it, has more holes than the Moon does craters. The entire package is an insult to the audience. No matter what their age may be. Lucas had sixteen years to make this movie. After watching it, you get the distinct feeling that he spent those sixteen years inventing the special effects you see in the movie, but put off writing the script until the night before filming began.

But really.  Jar Jar was ridiculous.  I'd take Chewie over that thing anyday.  Jake Lloyd was almost as bad.  My nephew could have been more believable.
It looks like the DVD has lots of features, and might be worth the money.  I bought the VHS format, and wasn't really going to buy the DVD until I saw how much more was offered on the DVD edition.

662716,5,6303454038,"It was said that Star Wars wouldnt make its way to DVD for years to come.  However the demand grew so intence, Lucas decided to feed our hunger, if only for a little while.  I got this DVD early from a friend who works at Blockbuster...so i was very excited to be amoung the first to own this film on DVD.
Everyone has seen Episode 1 so I don't need to go on about the movie itself, but the special features instead.
Disc one has commentary with George Lucas and Crew, but no cast memebers.  That itself is the only dissapointing thing on this DVD.  It would have been nice to hear Liam Neeson, and Ewan McGregor talk about the experience.  Also George Lucas pauses for long periods of time, before speaking again, I started losing interest into what he was saying, and more interested in watching the film again.
Disc two has all the good stuff, outside of the movie.  You can view the deleted scenes seperately, or they are intergrated back into the movie, if you can catch them.  The film itself has many extended scenes at Corousant, and The Pod Race at Tatooine.  Each deleted scene comes with an interview with Lucas explainging why it was cut and so on.
The rest is all normal features.  There are 5 documentaries and a bunch of other toys to play with.  Its really a great DVD, with hours of fun.  Also each time you put it in, the menu screen changes to a different scene.  Its really nice looking.
It sounds great, picture looks great.  Feels like your back in the theatre again..all you need is movie popcorn.

I realy can't understand the way they cut the pod-race for the release of the film. the left out all the intresting parts and went with the boring stuff. I've always got bored when I watched it. for the DVD the put back in some of those intersting moments but still the coolest of the all, sebulba's fire thrower they left out. this DVD made me love the podrace and bag for more. all in all this DVD made me like TPM much more cuz now i can better understand it and it's even got me more optimistic about AOTC cuz u can actually see that Lucas felt he went a bit to far on this one. It even made me like Jar Jar a little bit, well, maybe not like him but feel sorry for him.

662718,3,6303454038,"I had a feeling I was not going to like this movie. The trailers looked disappointing and I just felt a modern Stars Wars flick would put all of them out of place. I was wrong. This is a good movie, and even though it was disappointing and a little too modern for me like I thought it would be, I was entertained throughout. The film has some very good action scenes, great acting from Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman (whose character twist, quite simply, confused the hell out of me) and the visuals are breathtaking. However, good visuals, brilliant sound and fabulous editing do not a great movie make. The things I disliked about the movie were the fact that the character of Obi-Wan Kenobi hardly has any involvement into the plot, but the twist at the end is sure to have him more included in Star Wars: Episode II  Attack of the Clones. I also hated the character of Jar Jar Binks. What an annoying little [guy]! Technically, he was pretty amazing, but he was just a brat with an overacted voice by Ahmed Best and some of the cheesiest lines in any recent sci-fi film. The worst thing about the movie, however, is the fact that the villain is never really developed. I wouldve liked to know more about Darth Mauls background and attitude, but all I knew about him was he has a red and black head, is the apprentice of the evil Mayor and has a double light-saber. Despite that, I was entertained by the movie and I didn't hate it. The pod race was exciting, the boy wasn't annoying like that AWFUL Jar Jar Binks and I loved seeing Yoda again, a little younger. Hopefully, for the next instalment, the plot will be a little better, Chewbacca and Han Solo will return, the villain will be better developed and we won't see anymore of Jar Jar Binks! Lets just say the force wasn't exactly with George Lucas for this movie, but it was a good stab at a saga beginning.
NOTE: This DVD is brilliant! There are so many features, I loved the making of the game and the commentaries the most. Even if you only though the movie was average like me and didn't buy the movie, ask a friend with this DVD if you could check it out because the behind-the-scenes and commentaries and making-of features are well worth a look.",1002240000,4,2214,4.41320293398533

This film is beautifully shot with sweeping camera shots that reveal the glory of this new land.  People say that it doesn't compare to the previous three movies in content or execution.  I believe that people have canonized the original trilogy without really investigating the claims that they are making.  The original trilogy is poorly shot, replete with bad dialouge, and could not have worse acting.  It is beloved by everyone because it was so revolutionary at the time.

And the story are a little bit shaking. Anakin was a good P I L- O T when obiwan met him, not a R A C E R. How can he then learn exactly how to fly a fighter in a minute when adult people learn to fly only after a year? Sure luke is a good fighter, but i don't think he flied when he was 9 years old. I know Lucas can do better than this, its clear that he did this movie to make money.

EPISODE I still has a lot going for it.  It has all the great special effects and action sequences that the first three movies contained, the pod race being one of the best examples.  It also has a few really good characters like the quietly menacing Senator Palpatine and the criminally underused Darth Maul.  I especially found Ewan McGregor impressive as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi.
But on the other hand, it does have its weaknesses.  I am in complete agreement with those were annoyed with Jar Jar, but I also found Natalie Portman's performance as Queen Amidala as pleasant as someone trying to write on a chalkboard using a rusty nail.

Not even Lucas could live up to expectations with the hype we've created since the his announcement that he planned on making these movies (about the time of Empire Strikes Back).  But let's face it.  Look at Lucas's style.  Was Episode IV REALLY all that different?
Lucas always starts with a movie more to introduce the characters than to give them depth, and then he spends the second film doing that, so we can expect to see this happen with Episode II.  Then, he rushes to a sterling climax with the third of a trilogy.
And just think, Lucas has to keep excitement in these first three, and still BUILD to the originial trilogy.

662806,4,6303454038,"This is an excerpt from what Kevin Smith had to say after seeing it. I agree most that if you went in with low expectations you liked it better and that the lightsaber battles were absolutely incredible.
""Of the film, I can say many things. But the long and short of it is that I liked it - quite a bit. It starts great, ends great, and has great stuff sprinkled in between. Is there too much Jar Jar? For a small stretch, yes; but then the Binks quotient calms down considerably. Is the kid bad? I thought he was okay. He certainly wasn't wooden, as some people have suggested. He was a kid actor - no more, no less. I will say that - while it's probably unintentional, his exhuberance juxtaposes nicely against what he eventually becomes in the stories. Is it a puppet-heavy, CGI affair? There's a great deal of it, but not to the point where it's irritating (though the two-headed pod-race comentator was a bit much).
I think the key is to go in with low expectations. I did, and I really dug it. Dug it more with distance. I'd see it again.
The stuff I liked: Liam, Ewan, Darth Maul (who's in the 2:10 flick for maybe a half hour, tops), R2's introduction, the reappearance of the Tusken Raiders, the treatment of the Jedi as supreme badasses that are to be feared, the political subplot, the fact that Lucas slows the second act way down to introduce Anakin, and of course, the lightsaber battles. The use of the lightsaber in this flick is astounding; worth the price of admission alone. I'm sure in about a week, it's going to become quite fashionable to bash this flick - hard. But I'd like to go on record as saying I dug it. It's a good movie with great moments.
Anyway, see the flick when it comes out. It's better than half the crap out there, and it's got history on its side.
In a world of grades: B+ or A-
In a world of stars: 3 or 3 and a 1/2""",1001289600,4,1859,4.254237288135593

As a movie overall the CG was amazing and the battles were mouth-dropping. But at the end of the movie you feel like something was missing.  The plot was true to Lucas' style but some of the lines were a little corny (Anakin's ""yipee!""). This movie is a definite must have because it plays an important role in the saga.

Obi-Wan will also forget about R2-D2, who saved him and others by repairing the ship. I won't go on lest I annoy myself more.
It was the most complete and total shattering of everything about the previous movies that I held dear. As for this being for the kids, bollocks to that.

Darth Maul and Qui-Gon would have been very interesting characters if we had recieved a little back story. If you ask anyone who their favorite character was, they say Darth Maul because he looks cool. Because he looks cool? Wow, they were really into what was happening emotionally with the character. Oh, yeah, Lucas didn't let us know about that. As for the storyline, it sounds like he wrote it over a weekend while he had a hangover. The dialogue was surprisingly horrible. The only intelligent speech actually came from the ultra annoying Jar-Jar Binks. He isn't funny!! Don't bring him back in Episode two!! I have all ready begun loosing faith in Episode two due to the title. ""Attack of the Clones"" ? Someone is puffing the peace pipe too much. What is wrong with ""The Clone Wars""?

And yes, some of the rich ""you're deep in the middle of a story"" feeling of the other movies is lost here, since this of course is the beginning. Still, the Star Wars series has had an incredible impact on most people - from references to it showing up *everywhere*, to use of its terms in standard news broadcasts, even to many young women realizing, through Leia and Amidala, that women *can* be wielding laser pistols right alongside the men.
I got the VHS version immediately, and there was no question in my mind that I would order this DVD as soon as humanly possible, and sit and explore its NUMEROUS special features. The commentary, storyboards, documentaries, features on design, and rest are all fascinating.
To me, this movie wasn't of epic, sweeping moments, although there were a few of those. Perhaps THE favorite scene of mine is when Qui-Gon and Darth Maul are face to face with the energy barrier between them. They both realize that they temporarily are ""stuck"". Qui-Gon uses this time in the best possible way he can - he sits and recharges, storing all of his energy for the fierce battle that is about to come. Darth Maul is incapable of any thought but getting at Qui-Gon - and paces back and forth, burning his energy and impatient to get at it. This one scene symbolizes to me the huge difference between the sides of the force.
Yes, the graphics are incredible, but the light saber battles to me are far more impressive, the amazing choreography that outshine any previous fight scenes. The pod racing scenes ended up getting me addicted to the pod racer game for a solid month, if not more.
It's a movie that gets into you and has implications on the things we aspire to and the way in which we talk to each other. That's pretty impressive for a sci-fi tale. I highly recommend getting this, if only because it is a piece of our cultural history.",1000339200,4,2019,4.580110497237569

662995,4,6303454038,"For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Star Wars saga I'd like to welcome you to the planet Earth and ask if your stay on Mars was enjoyable.
Now with that aside, I'm sure this is a statment that will anger alot of fans out there; This movie is not that bad. It is rather enjoyable if you take it in the context of the series. It essentially lays the foundation for the entire Star Wars saga. Now with that said, I will freely admit that there are some problems with this film. First being that the Star Wars mythology is so vast and so expansive that the story does tend to get bogged down in detail (Unknown to the casual fan there is even a back story BEFORE the Phantom Menace detailing an era in the Star Wars timeline called the ""Sith War"". The Sith War could have easily been scripted for another trilogy. That's is how enormous the scope of the Star Wars universe).
There are some scenes that seem very extraneous that make me wonder what deleted scenes that will be included in the DVD version that actually did end up on the cutting room floor. All the basic elements of a Star Wars movie are here ( i.e. the lightsaber duels, epic scale battles, daring escape, etc.) but the pace of the movie tends to lag in the middle. One can't help but think if this is the result from the fact that George Lucas hasn't made a movie in over 16 years. Where a movie like X-Men seems to grab you and keep you riveted to your seat, Phantom Menace offers plenty of time for bathroom breaks without missing any relevant action. Hopefully in Episode II ""Attack of the Clones"" ( can you believe that name?) the story will be tightened up considerably.
Even with all that said the fact remains that this is still a Star Wars movie. Though it is probably the weakest film in the series it still is head and shoulders above anything else in the sci-fi/fantasy genre. Being an anime fan it is not a stretch that the Star Wars universe could easily co-exist within the anime universe. It does after all borrow alot of story elements from many of todays popular anime series ( such themes as redemption and self discovery are popular in the anime genre). It wouldn't be a stretch to say that the Star Wars saga is in fact a live action anime story. And the Phantom Menace, though flawed as it may be, is still an excellent starting point to that story.

No matter if you do or not, let's consider another fact, is American English superior or British English superior?
In my opinion, no accent is superior than another, it's just the matter of how many people are using a particular accent. By the way, most people in Star Wars universe speak American accent, should a English man say that's racism too?
Speaking of the film, can you really believe that Jar Jar would speak a perfect British accent? That would make people laugh.

662999,5,6303454038,"Ok, this review has to be done in two parts because I'd like to address both the content of the movie itself as well as the DVD release. Here we go.
As a longtime Star Wars fan (first movie I ever saw was ""Star Wars"" in its theatrical release in 1977 - I was 4) I deliberately avoided the hype and promotional campaigns surrounding the release of ""Episode I"" in 1999. I thought I'd be more objective if I went into the film with no expectations. Since then I've seen it once again, on video. Based on those two viewings, here's my opinion:
The good: Ewan McGregor as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, the political machinations of Senator Palpatine (staging a Trade Federation conflict to precipitate his rise to Chancellor of the Senate), the closing two-on-one Jedi battle (great choreography), some excellent special-effects work (the cityscapes of Coruscant and Naboo are intricately detailed), nice glimpses of familiar characters in their salad days (Artoo, Threepio, Jabba, etc) and cameos of others (note the Wookies in the Senate, as well as the species we know fondly as E.T.). There's a lot to like in this movie.
The bad: debunking of the mythic origins of The Force (it turns out to be a parasitic microorganism), anthropomorphic stereotypes and caricatures (specifically, the Trade Federation and the Gungans), continuity problems with the rest of the saga (Invincible battle droids and destroyer droids predate stormtroopers who fall over if you sneeze at them? Anakin built Threepio? Obi-Wan was apprenticed to Qui-Gon Jinn, not Yoda?), lack of any real character development (remember Captain Panaka? Neither do I, but he's got an action figure), and more than anything else CGI overload (at times you feel like you're watching a cartoon, especially during the Gungan battle with the droids).
The downright ugly: the presence of Jar-Jar Binks and the acting performance of Jake Lloyd. I know he's just a kid, but we've all seen what Haley Joel Osment is capable of, so this kid has no excuse.
Overall ""Eisode I"" is a so-so movie, important primarily for its role as the ""stage-setter"" (being the first of three). It's a far cry from the triumph of ""the Empire Strikes Back"" which is the high point of the saga so far, but it's no chopped liver either.
That said, on to the DVD release.
The good: George Lucas commentary! Seven deleted scenes! Five featurettes! A one-hour ""making-of"" documentary! Multi-angle storyboards! And a music video too! This is a smorgasbord of extras for any movie buff and definately worth the price.
The bad and ugly: why can't the original trilogy get this treatment? I know George is busy working on ""Episode 2: Insert Riduculous Title Involving Clones Here"" but c'mon - do we really have to wait until 2010 for the ""Episodes IV - VI"" DVD releases?
Bottom line: this DVD should be on any Star Wars fan's list on general principle, and on any movie fan's list for the extras alone.",999561600,7,2919,4.851703406813627
663000,2,6303454038,I'm suprised at this movie. I was realy cheesed off. I thought this would be some great scifi drama like the last 3. You could call this a kids movie practicly. In the movie the good guys will only nuetrilise threats if they our non living. Naboo all they talk about is we must realy on negotioations. Even when the power is out. There was no siege at all they didn't even go down figting on there own. It reminds reminds me of the halacust. They dont't even pick up a laser until the Jedis come.,999561600,,496,4.177083333333333
663001,5,6303454038,"Yes there was a plot, a story, and good acting in The Phantom Menace; more ever, it was not just a F/X film! I have read some funny things in how the Fanboys express their limited opinion about The Phantom Menace. I find it my job to add my rebuttal to their case, and defend a movie saga that I love.
I cannot see how a film that can be so bad, that it end up making over 430 million dollars at the Box Office here in the U.S.? One would have to conclude that there are far less nay sayers, and that they are very vocal about their hatred for a good film. I am sure these are the people that would say: ""The Matrix was a better movie."" If that were true, would it have made more money than The Phantom Menace? Thus showing that the Fanboys are out numbered, in their idea that The Phantom Menace was a bad movie!
So, why was Jar Jar put into the movie? Well if you watched it, you will understand that they needed Jar Jar to bring the Gungans, and the people of Theed together. So, they can fight the trade federation in the end. Also, unless you don't have kids of your own(and fanboys don't); it would be hard to understand the enjoyment they have watching Jar Jar. So please put your own selfishness aside, and let kids enjoy a character that does have a purpose in the Star Wars Universe! Unlike some people I did enjoy Jar Jar, and looking forward to see him in EP II:)
Now people what do you really want from a 9 year old? Is life so bad for you fanboys, that your going to base a whole movie on a kid that acts like a 9 year old? LOL.. How pathetic can you get? Is it so hard to see, or even look at the idea of loss of innocents? Can you not see a boy that is full of hope, and dreams of doing good for everybody one day; just to see all that strip away in the end. Can you not see the power, or even the sadness behind that? So, I found it very powerful to show this, the glory before the fall. Also I did find Jack Lloyd playing as Anakin Skywalker good, and delivered his lines very well.
I did found The Phantom Menace on par with the rest of the Star Wars saga; further more, it is refreshing that it did not copy everything that the first three movies did! This is a new Trilogy, with a new direction that will connect with the original trilogy in the end.
So, please don't let people try to talk you into not getting or buying this movie! Find our for yourself, please:) Than make your opinion known, I am sure you will enjoy this movie.
The Phantom Menace is a great movie, like the rest of the Star Wars Saga. It is different from the rest, because it is NEW story that needs to be different from the first Trilogy! Would you like watching the same story again? I know I would not:)
I am happy to see that we are going to get this on DVD now. I have been waiting forever to get a Star Wars Movie on DVD. It would seem we are going to have to wait for another 4 to 6 years to get the whole saga on DVD, and I'll be there to buy them when they do:)
p.s. if the fanboys only complaint about the movie is two characters, and the titles of the movie. I say we are in pretty good shape! Let them complain, while we enjoy a great movie over and over again; more ever, enjoy The Phantom Menace for what it is... ENTERTANMENT:-)",999475200,,3237,4.012383900928793

Aside from Luke's confrontation with the emperor and Vader, ROTJ is a joke! It took all the great developments of Ep 4 & 5 and flushed them down a toilet with a bunch of stupid muppets! I'll take Jar Jar over the Ewoks anyday! Ep 1 had many great scenes and the beginning of a great story. While it's no Empire, it's still better than Jedi. As far as the CGI, it isn't by any means perfect, but it's a great alternative to the Muppet Show which Jedi is!",999388800,,574,3.956896551724138
663066,3,6303454038,"The world of SW is changing.  The Bantham novels are replaced by Del Rey's New Jedi Order series, Dark Horse's comics are now set in a new era, and the latest SW film is released.
[sighs]
I guess I'm going to be one of the old whiners who sits back and tells long stories about the 'good old days or Stackpole, Zahn, and Irving Kershner'.  The new SW just fails to match.  I moaned on and on about the NJO series in my 'Vector Prime' review, so I won't put you throuogh that here.  The start of the new trilogy leaves a lot to be desired, though.
The story's okay, although it fails to reach a full potential.  Lucas tried to do a politcal/intruige/adventure/ect. job with this one, wheras the others were war/adventure movies.  Leave politics to guys like Stackpole and Zahn, as they do it much better.
The special effects are good, and it was great to see Coruscant in all its slendor for the first time.  The lightsabre battle was superb, although the land and space battles and the end had their potential muddled by the blabberings and buffoonery of Anakin and Jar Jar.  Sithspawn, they were annoying.
Pretty movie, and lots of info and the like for SW fans.  I can't say I reccomend it for those who aren't SW fans, though.  for those who do, watch it to see Palpatine at his best.  Only thing is, that's about all that's at its best.",999302400,,1340,4.384615384615385
663067,2,6303454038,"What can I say? Lucas falls flat. Sure the film looks beautiful but it has no magic like the first three. Gone is the shoot em up space cowboy thriller of before and replaced with a kids movie with adorable Jar Jar Binks. The enemies are droids so with the exception of Darth Maul there are no real fatalities in this film. What happened to legions of Storm Troopers and planets being destroyed. Instead, we have a cream puff movie where the end is all happy and laughs and no one is left no laughing. This would have been great as a Scooby Doo episode!",999216000,,553,4.276190476190476
663068,3,6303454038,"Definitely my least favorite Episode of the Star Wars saga. I think the biggest problem was George Lucas getting so wrapped up in all of today's computer technology that he forgot the basics that got him where he is today.
What I really enjoyed about the original Star Wars trilogy is that everything is rather believeable. All the monsters, all the characters are real life-like. Look at the Ewoks, for instance. Now imagine if all the Ewoks were computer generated like Jar-Jar Binks. It would have looked horrible. It's so obvious to tell the difference between a real character and computer generated character in a movie when they're standing side by side. I really hated in Episode I how so much of it was computer generated scenes, such as the whole war near the end. It simply doesn't have the same effect. I mean, I thought I'm suppose to be watching something believeable, not Toy Story.
Another thing was the fight scene between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan, and Qui-Gon.  As much as I enjoyed it, and hated seeing Darth Maul killed (he was by far my favorite character in Episode I...now why didn't he get more lines?!), it was probably the most anti-climatic battle ever.  Look at Luke vs. Vader from Return of the Jedi.  The emotion that poured out of Luke after Vader saying perhaps he could turn Leia to the dark side as he screamed out, ""NOOOO!"" and the music kicked in and Luke pounded away on him until he cut off his hand.  Now look at the Episode I fight scene.  I loved that music, however where was it when they die?  When Darth Maul gets killed (in a rather ...way, too), it's like dead silence.  No music, no nothing, just silence.  Where the emotion?  The power that music can play is incredible, but the use of music in Episode I wasn't to its full potential (much like the rest of the movie wasn't at its full potential).
Episode I seemed to be more about flashy costumes and characters rather than story. Lucas needs to return to the basics of solid storytelling and using real characters, not all this computer animated garbage.
I'm expecting a lot more out of Episode II.",999216000,,2093,4.589812332439679
663069,5,6303454038,"It was to be expected this movie would be critized on its story line & character development. But consider this. Episode I has the far from enviable task to introduce the entire SW universe and set the major plot lines that run throughout the whole saga in about two hours.
In all, Episode I is a truly great prequel and yet another benchmark from Industrial Light & Magic.
Now a response to alot of misguided fans out there,
Ignore the disappointed fanboys who made the mistake of watching this movie with the expectation that Lucas made this movie for that same generation only. They were kids when Star Wars blew them out of their seats and Lucas wasn't going to betray a considerable part of his original target audience.
And all the Episode I-bashing isn't going to cause Lucas to make the mistake of trying to redo, or even outdo the first trilogy.
He's adding to his vision of what it should be. And in all fairness, Lucas owns SW, he will add to his saga however he sees fit because it was his brainchild in the first place.
Often I've read, ""this is not my StarWars!"" Well, it's been over two decades since A New Hope and you can't make a new movie look believably vintage. They don't make 'em like they used to, get over it & enjoy Episode II in 2002!",999129600,,1261,4.3931623931623935
663070,1,6303454038,"Defenders of Episode I are quick to claim that audiences were disappointed only because their expectations were too high. But make no mistake, Episode I is a bad, bad movie. It is bad on its own, and absolutely tragic as a follow-up to the greatest sci-fi trilogy of all time.
With all the negative comments already made about this dissapointing movie, what else is there to say? Perhaps this: Episode I is the work of a filmmaker who no longer respects his audience or his own past accomplishments.
George Lucas accomplished what few artists ever do: With the original trilogy, he got millions of people the world over to invest themselves deeply in the fantasy world he created. Now, with Episode I, he trashes that lovingly created world, and spits on the loyalty of his onetime fans.
Did you think the Force was a mystical, secret power pervading the universe? Sorry, it's basically an infection caused by space bacteria.
Want sharply written banter between intriguing characters? You get the forgettable Captain Panaka, the silly Boss Nass, and the appalling Jar-Jar Binks, who, amazingly, tops Jake Lloyd on the annoy-o-meter.
Want a carefully-constructed plot? Sorry, you'll get only a carelessly conceived rehash of the three-battle climax of ""Jedi"" -- including yet ANOTHER evil battlestation destroyed when the hero ignites a chain reaction from the inside.

663072,4,6303454038,"Ok, it's not perfect, but neither was the first one. Episode one is just more of what we already expect from Star Wars. It has a story that can only happen in the Star Wars universe. It has a strong female role and a lot of fast moving vehicles. What it is missing is the in depth story that was already established with the first Star Wars movie in 1977. In that movie, there had already been a war (the clone wars), Luke's parents were dead, his mother a mystery, his father a hero (at least at first), the Senate was disbanded and this seemingly all powerful empire controlled everything. We were thrown into the middle of it all. Now where do start all this? George has done a good job but it's obvious he had a better idea of Vader's prime and his demise then he did of his beginnings. With `Attack of the Clones' (oohh, that title) being released next summer I believe he will get into the thick of it now that we have an origin established. Episode One is a beginning, the beginning of a much larger story. In a nutshell, a corrupt trade federation is blockading an innocent planet in order for the council to debate the status. Queen Amadala is the newly elected leader of her planet. Young and beautiful, and slightly nave, she is being manipulated by Senator Palpatine in a ploy to get himself elected to a higher position by forcing her hand. This is where Episode 1 is most intriguing. The underlying deceit of this Senator, who we all know the fate of already, is nothing less than evil. We see what he is doing, and we hate him for it. It is actually a very complicated political scheme; Senator Palpatine blockades her planet secretly because he needs her vote to eject the current counselor so he can move in on his position. We see the workings of a brilliant manipulator starting and unfortunately we know how it ends up. Thankfully, Lucas doesn't try to hide it from us as if we are new comers. It's subtle enough to not grab our attention, but clear enough to make sure those of us who know the truth are not having to search for it. The entrance of the Jedi Knights (McGregor and Neeson) is a monkey wrench in the works of this deceit and suggests someone in the council is at least partially aware of the plans of the Senator. Moving on from the political aspect, there are plenty of marketable creatures to make action figures from and despite Jar Jar's annoying personality, the rest of the movie is still very well done. The affects are awesome, nothing less can be expected from the creator of ILM, and the action scenes are spectacular. The lightsaber dual at the end is hands down the most awesome melee ever put on film. One gripe is the fact that Anakins actions at the end of the movie saved everyone, and he did it by accident...maybe George believes we will chalk it up to subconscious use of the force. The actors are all good. The boy is a bit of an amateur but he holds his own. You couldn't have found a better likeness for Obi Wan then Ewan McGregor. Liam Neeson is so charismatic and powerful that you have no choice but to believe in him. Natalie Portman is a heartbreaker and she plays her role of Royalty with every bit of forcefulness as Carrie Fisher did for Leia. You can really believe that this girl is her mother. The pod sequence is another foray in Lucas' obsession with speed and it will most likely be outdone in the next movie. Overall, you have to cut Lucas some slack, he hadn't directed since the first Star Wars movie. The story line is thin but it is the beginning of a much larger story. When all is done, it will be considered a part of whole and then I think it will be seen in a better light.",999043200,44,3654,4.359237536656892
663073,1,6303454038,"This movie is a stink-bomb. The plot is lame. The acting is bad. The dialogue is flat.

I didn't care about anybody in this movie. At the portion where they reveal that the queen is the servant and the servant is the queen, <GASP WITH SHOCK>, the camera pans to show the shocked and surprised reaction of everyone in the room. I also was shocked and surprised, that anything so bad could make it to the big screen. That pregnant pause and pan to shocked expressions was so bad it was laughable. I was left totally dry by this huge revelation, and if a dramatic high point of the movie left me dry, imagine how I felt about the rest of it.

This movie tries to mix live action with animation. That is difficult and has seldom given good results. Maybe ""the mummy returns"" was successful, but this was not.

The Computer graphic (CG) world left me emotionless. The battle scenes looked like a video game, how can I get excited about that? Plus, by now I have seen enough CG epic battle scenes to last me a lifetime, The Mummy, Star Wars I, Final Fantasy, Mummy II, all featured epic battle scenes with a cast of one (computer programmer, that is). It just doesn't cut it.

The journey thru the fish world was stupid. By contrast the similar journey in Disney's ""Atlantis"" had me squirming out of my seat with excitment.

The pod race is great, it's worth watching and has sparks of inspiration. The double headed announcer that does his own color was funny and creative, the sand people taking pot shots at the racers, the Ben Hur inspired race, Anakin rewiring his pod in the middle of the race - all great stuff.

We all agree that Jar Jar Binks was a mistake. What makes it unforgiveable is that they made exactly the same mistake 20 years ago in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" where C-3PO was annoyingly obnoxious. When C-3PO was switched off, everyone sighed with relief, both on screen and in the audience. That means the movie is better without him than it is with him, so leave him out! I don't pay $7.50 to be annoyed. Loveable, funny, cute is what we need, not annoying.

My friend tells me that the final fight was excellent choreography. I can believe that but the scene was ruined for me by the lack of story content. During the lapses when the force fields kept the fighters apart, there was a silent minute or two. I can imagine the screenwriters leaving that portion blank and promising to drop in some super secret, earth shattering dialog later. When the dialog came thru and was found to be lame, I can hear the suits saying: ""Just have the characters glare at each other meaningfully. This is for kids anyway....just cut it and print it. Let's get this thing out the door."" I'm sorry, that just doesn't cut it!

Don't talk to me about expectations. On an absolute scale this movie stinks. Anyway, how can I not be disappointed by a techno movie made in 2000 that doesn't live up to a movie made in 1977?

What it proves is that art is about the same things it has always been about, drama, excellent writing, characters, motivations, etc etc. You can't ignore all that, spend $??? Million on computers and expect to have something worthwhile.",998956800,,3155,4.492146596858639

Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and the rest of the cast do a bangup job with their parts and the battle scenese are incredible, especially between the Jedi and Darth Maul.  As a martial artist, I can really appreciate the choreography that went into those scenes.  But they were a bit drawn out.
Don't get me wrong, this is a great sci-fi film, but I do wish that Lucas had thought more before putting it on the big screen.",998524800,2,1141,4.206422018348624

Expectations were simply just too high. The first three Star Wars movie were great, but not critically acclaimed since, lets face it, some of the dialog was corny. But at least there were great characters that you could love.  With Phantom Menace the biggest let down is the lack of great characters. In the original movies you have a more threatening villan. In Phantom Menace, Darth Maul seemed like he was just thrown in the movie for the light saber scenes. The only character i did enjoy was Senator Palatine, he was the only one in the movie that seemed to have the dimension, and intelligence that the characters from the original movie had. All the other characters, especially the annoying Jar Jar Binks, were not as likable as the original cast...although he seems to be the most memorable character from the movie just from the fact that everyone hated him so much.
 Great, ground-breaking things were done with special effects and animation in this movie. It seems too much attention was put into being 'state-of-the-art' and not enough attention to story lines and characters. The original Star Wars didn't have all the digital gagetry that this one had but still told an interesting story. Some other things raise questions also, like the huge age difference between the Queen Amedala and Anakin Skywalker!
After watching and loving the Original Star Wars trilogy it is hard to totally hate this movie. As far as classic sci-fi motion pictures goes i think maybe George Lucas should have left well enough alone and just be known for three great movies. But i think that no matter how bad his movies are we will still watch them and buy them just because we are addicted to the Star War legacy...even though the long wait for the release of the DVD version is a blantent attempt to get more of our money, after already buying the VHS version.",998524800,,1998,4.673295454545454

Some people say that this movie is bland, but it's two purposes are to introduce you to several characters, and to give you a reference to several events mentioned in Episodes 2 and 3.  I've read all of the spoilers to Episode 2, and many of the events in Episode 1 will make much more sense when the next 2 movies come out.  Episode 2 will definately be the best Star Wars film released as of yet BY FAR (see my review of Episode 2 that I just posted on amazon).",998524800,2,613,4.083333333333333

Episode One, was garbage, and anyone that says that is isn't is surely mistaken.  This movie lacked in everything that made the first (or second, i'm not completely sure anymore) trilogy entertaining: dialougue, story-line, and character development.  The kid who played Anakin has no business being an actor, and some of his lines were so disturbingly bad that I could feel my lungs caving in everytime he said a word.  The introduction of the medi-chlorians made absolutely no sense in any possible way and took away from any mystery the original ""Force"" had.  Sure, I don't know anybody who would turn down the powers of the Force, but that the fact that there would be ""things"" inside me wouldn't feel too good.  But I'm not going to name all the bad points (cough*jar-jar*cough).  I mean the movie did have it's moments, but so did Josie and the Pussycats, and that doesn't make it good.  OK, the graphics were damn good and the fight scene between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul put anything Vader and Luke did to shame, but those qualities alone don't make a movie.  I can only pray that Episode 2 will bring back any credibility Lucas had, but with a name like ""Episode II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES!""

Well, after watching this episode a thousand times,i can honestly say that this is a true classic along with  ANH, TESB, and ROTJ. So lucas did it again! a perfect opening for the entire saga. It's paced with breathtaking new environments and landscapes. The John Williams score is amazing, Ben Burtt mixed  really sensitive and original sound effects once again!

There is some great action and some quality intrigue contained to TPM itself.
Two small lapses in the film:  1) that little kid who plays young Anakin Skywalker is a lousy actor, even for his age, and 2) Jar-Jar Binks not only doesn't get shot right after we meet him, but he lives to film's end and is rumored to be in ""Attack of the Clones.""

663228,5,6303454038,"Virtually every one of the millions of people who grew up loving the original Star Wars films had an idea of what Episode I should have been. That kind of devotion and anticipation easily produces failed expectations and harsh criticism. That being said, the tantrum thrown by many Star Wars fans because George Lucas didn't make the film just the way they would have done it tends to obscure this film's greatness.
The Phantom Menace has its flaws: Jar Jar Binks is exceedingly irritating; Jake Lloyd's performance as Anakin Skywalker is very mediocre; the characters don't endear themselves to you the way they did in Episodes IV, V, and VI, partly because you don't get to know them nearly as well. Who cares what becomes of the Naboo pilots or the Gungan soldiers?
What Lucas did in the Phantom Menace was lay the groundwork for the two darker films yet to come. Episode I showed us what Jedi can do given a full complement of training and modern special effects. When the Jedi go to work, the visuals are as action-packed as any shoot-'em-up you'll ever see. The nastiness of galactic politics is sure to play a bigger role in Episodes II and III, but Lucas has already given us a glance of the nefariousness faced by the Republic. The scenes on the capital planet of Coruscant were some of the most intriguing of the film, not to mention some of the most stunning to watch.
Viewing the Phantom Menace by itself, perhaps it doesn't deserve five stars. But it wasn't made to stand alone. When the trilogy of prequels is complete, Jar Jar and the childhood Anakin aren't going to detract from the overall enjoyment of the tale spun by Lucas. Episode I is an integral part of telling that story. Star Wars fans seeking a religious experience should look for it in a house of worship, not a movie theater. Star Wars, including the Phantom Menace, is just a story, but a fascinating, remarkably illustrated one.",998265600,4,1911,4.65680473372781
663229,2,6303454038,"Very Disappointing.
I am a die hard Star Wars fan, which is why I believe I was so disappointed with this movie. I ended up seeing it twice on opening day, but fell asleep during the hour and a half ""plot- building"" portion of the movie the second time around. (Jedis fly to Naboo. Jedis kill droids. Jedis imitate Jaques Cousteau. Jedis rescus Queen. Jedis fly to Tatooine. Jedis watch boy in pod race. Jedis watch horribly over dramatic acting of future dark lord of the sith. Jedis fly to Corcusant...)
In my opinioin, this was a passable movie. It was entertaining at times, but I will not be seeing it thirteen times in the theater as I did for the first Star Wars. I did see it a second time, but only because I had already prepurchased the tickets. If it was up to me, I would have seen the Matrix a third time instead.
What was wrong:
* Lack of Epic Scale - If Episodes IV, V, and VI were comparable to World Wars I, II, and III (whenever that is going to be) then Episode I was equivalent to a civil war in a small South  American village. The first three movies were EPICS, they told stories of good vs evil on a galactic scale. Episode I told of a minor skirmish of political beauracracy that was very uninteresting.
* Lack of Memorable characters, droids, vehicles - The first series gave us Luke, Lei, Han, Darth Vader, C-3P0, R2-D2, Obi-Wan, Chewbacca, Boba Fett, Millenium Falcoln, the Death Star, Star Destroyers, X-wings, Y-wings, etc...This first movie gave us Obi-Wan. There are more characters and machinery that I would never want to see again, than see return. From a merchandising standpoint, how does Lucas expect to make any money of those ridiculous looking donut shaped warships? In particular, Darth Maul is a particularly weak character. The only time he shows up, is when it is time to deliver some much needed action to a dragging plot. There should never be comparissons between Maul and Vader, as they don't even come close to comparing. Vader is the embodiement of presence and character, whereas Maul is just some face painted goon.
* Terribly annyoing characters - Anakin, Jar Jar, anyone from the Trade Federation...Hopefully all of these characers will be dragged off and shot during the time between this movie and the  next.
* Horribly mangled English - Jar Jar, anyone from Naboo who was not a human, anyone from the Trade Federation, anyone from Tatooine who was not a human...When you can't understand what is being said, it really is hard to develop a plot.
* Awful acting - Anakin, every single extra or bit character...on the bright side, Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and  Natalie Portman did a very good job, Ewan in particular. However, all of the bit characters were terrible. In particular, the Naboo fighter pilots stood out to me as terrible method  acting. (Note to future script writers and bit actors: whenever you speak aloud your observations or your thoughts, chances are yor acting will be unbelievable.)
* Bastardizing legends - Jedi explanation of the Force in Star Wars, ""A universal energy field that binds us all together, guiding our actions"". Jedi explanation of the Force in Episiode I, ""A bacterial infection""...I much prefered the religious and mythical overtones of the force in the first three movies to the genetic engineering of Episode I. Question: If we know that ""midichlorines"" create Force sensative individuals, why aren't there a couple billion genetically engineered Jedis out there?
* Transparaent ""surprises"" - About five minutes into the Naboo invasion, the Queen and ""Padme"" switch places, supposedly in secret. Yet, after seeing ""Padme"" on screen for about three seconds, i said to myself ""Self, why did the Queen take off her makeup?"". Apparently the invading robot forces with their digitally enhanced optical inputs could not discern this difference as easily as my puny eyes.
* ""Nothing can beat Destroyer droids"" - According to this movie, two Destroyer droids can pretty much beat any invading force. These things show up twice in the movie, and while they are really cool to look at, they are apparently unbeatable to any invading force, whether human or Jedi. It is particularly galling that the two Jedis in the beginning of the movie, who have just mopped up anything the Trade Federation throw at them, run away so quickly after being set upoin by these droids. If these things are so great, why didn't the empire use them in episodes IV, V, and VI, and why in the world didn't the Trade Federation use these to invade Naboo instead of their pathetic ""Roger, Roger"" attack droids?!?
* Weak Beginning and End - The previous three movies started strongly and finished conclusively, even the second which had the arduous task of developing plot for the third movie. Episode I ""ended"", and yet the movie kept going for another fifteen minutes.
It sounds more like I hated the movie than merely being disappointed, but it did have its bright spots. Ewan McGregor was great as Obi-Wan, the lightsaber duels were excellently coregraphed (but still a pale refelection of Obi-Wan vs. Darth Vader, Luke vs Darth in ESB, and Luke vs Darth in ROJ), the special effects were indeed very good (when not used merely as screen shots), and the plot answers some age old questions (Why did Obi-Wan teach Anakin himself? How did the Emperor come to power? Why does Anakin become Darth Vader). Yet there was far more wrong with the movie than was right. I think the ultimate test, is whether this movie would have made any money without the previous three movies. I strongly believe that Lucas would have lost a lot of money on this movie without the crutch of a twenty year old Star Wars legend to lean on.",998265600,31,5683,4.760649087221095
663230,3,6303454038,"For some, the first trilogy represents a wonderful myth based on classic themes; for others who don't know what all the fuss is about, it's childish drek with lousy science and illogical continuity.  Harlan Ellison assailed the STAR WARS movie as dribble, citing, for instance, the fact that the space ships make noise in space (where there is no sound).
If you accept that Lucas is making a grand mythology - and that is clearly what he is attempting - then how does the beginning of this new trilogy (the story of the fall of Darth Vader) hold up?
Where it fails for me - besides the fact that we are following the story of Darth Vader, whereas personally I am more interested in the story of Obi-Wan - is that, in PHANTOM MENACE, the characters are not nearly as personable as Han, Luke, Leia, and family.  For all the goofy acting and mournfully trite dialogue perpetrated in those movies, the performances created characters we could feel we knew and liked, whereas in PHANTOM MENACE they are more like figures, played with sobriety as if enacting a museum piece.  No personal connection is possible with little Annakin, the dynamic duo jedis (although Ewan MacGregor does an impressive job emulating a younger version of the character created by Sir Alec Guinness, in body and voice), or even the amazing-looking villain with nothing to say and no back story of his own.
To make up for the lack of character, Lucas throws in the digitally-animated nuisance of Jar-Jar Binks, a ""loveable"" character most fans love to hate.  Is there anything endearing about this thing?
Without personable characters, the mythology is in danger of becoming grandiose; and that would be a sorry fate for what began with STAR WARS.",998265600,,1717,4.79054054054054

My opinion of PHANTOM MENACE is quite simply explained.  The original Star Wars looked real!!!  It looked real because it was real!! Models and sets. That was the beauty of it!
PHANTOM MENANCE, it seemed, was written in a manner to suit the computer effects they could do.  Many of the scenes served absolutely zero purpose, other than to show off the computer CGI JUNK.  Which, quite frankly, didn't transport the audience to a GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY, but instead into George Lucas' computer.
The other thing that ruined the movie for me, was the way they chopped up the final battle.  Cutting back and forth between the battle in the field and the lightsabre battle sucked the intensity, suspense and excitement right out of it.  Leaving me  going... humph, instead of WOW!!

They should of some how gotten rid of him in the begining, but they kept him around and made the movie so freakin annoying.

There is a reason for every part of Episode One.  The Stormtroopers are not a regression of technology. They came about from the downfall of the droids.  If you remember the achilles heel of the droids is the command ship.  Droids don't make good soldiers, you need living beings.  In the original (Ep-4) there are several references to ""The Clone Wars"".  The ""clones"" become stormtroopers, an entire army of clones.  Princess Leah acknowledges this to Luke with the famous line ""Aren't you a little short for a storm trooper?""  Yoda claims Anakin to be too old as an excuse not to train him because he sees danger in Anakin.  BUT! Qui-Gon was right... Anakin IS the one who, as prophecy dictates, brings balance to the force.  Remember Vader/Anakin kills the Emperor, NOT LUKE!  Even Vaders line to Obi-Won ""the last time we met... now I'm the master"" hints to the prequels, a fight is going to occur in Ep-2 or 3.  With upcoming episodes the evolution of Anakin to Vader will take center stage.  Episode One is a vehicle to bring Anakin to the Jedi.  If you recall the original Star Wars recieved mixed reviews when it was released in the later 70's.  Now it's a classic.  Keep watching you'll grow to love Ep-1 when the other pieces of the puzzle fall into place.  One thing I do agree on... Jar Jar was idiotic pandering to the god of merchandising.

663234,5,6303454038,"All real Star Wars fans saw this in the theater. Not everyone loved it as much as the trilogy. This is because these Episodes are like one big movie, cut into 6. The beginning of movies isn't always the most exciting, but it is very important to set-up the story line.
. . . . I will be the first to admit that Lucas' added humor (jar jar, singing number in ROTJ, ewoks, etc.) isn't always Steve Martin material, but hey it adds culture to the movie.
I think Episode one was very important in the story line and set-up for Episode II ""Attack of the Clones"". This movie is like a computers 101 class. You mainly learn the basics and Key Terms so you can excel in the next class. Examples are the scenes of the Jedi Council, the Senate meeting, Darth Maul and beginning of the Emperor, etc. Also mentions of Mediclorians, the gambling nature of Jabba and most species on Tatooine, introducing R2-D2 and C-3PO for the ""first time"".
There are so many of these things, it seems imperative that everyone buys this DVD. I am sure it will have plenty of ""Making of the Movie"" and maybe even sneak peaks at Episode II. Which I hear is a big possibility, hence the reason for the delay. Because if the DVD comes out in October, everyone will have it by Christmas and 3 or 4 months later Episode II will be out and have 3-4 months of Hype behind it.

663276,2,6303454038,"Ok, first of all I', giving it two, because it was watchable.  But lets compare.
Now of course the original movies were designed with plenty of cliche's and sillyness, but they tell a good story, certainly linked to mythology, and for the most part make sense.  Now its a known fact that lucas brought innovations in movie making in episodes 4 + 5 (ANH, ESB), but these were for story telling, not innovations for the sake of it.  I would argue that lucas has done so much with ILM and CG, that any new innovations were made for the sake of it.  I would also argue that unlike the previous movies, plot was built around these effects.  In the previous trilogy, the effects were build around the plot.  Jar-jar is the perfect example.  He can be explained away by the need to have the gundam (spelling?) forces during the final battle, but thats just a poor recreation of the ewoks.  Heres why: as annoying as we found the ewoks, there was a point:  technology alone doesnt win.  A less advanced force could win.  The ewok in ROTJ did it well, even if we as fans didn't like it.  The Droid/Gungam thing was just poor.  As was the anakin destroying the Droid Control Ship.  No point, other than to have anakin do it.  His winning the podrace was more than enough.  It was in fact, too much of a rip of the original movie.
Maul was an interesting character, but the audience never got to learn about him.  And then theres the movie itself... it was designed so you have to see it twice to understand lots of the lines in the beginning.  Ca-Ching!!!
Finally, a word to Mr. Lucas:  We're not stupid.  We do remember past statements, even though you claim they weren't made.  (PErfect example: on the Spec edition tapes, he talks about all 9 episodes, all written, although he doubted the last 3 would be made, that he had written it as 3 trilogies from the beginning).  3 years later, he says this is something someone else made up.  PErsonally, when i saw it, once the star wars euphoria wore off, it seemed to me like a movie with little thought into the script, and most into the effects.

With ""Return of the Jedi"" these ideals began to weaken. With ""The Phanton Menace"" they were abandoned completely. The special effects were good (hence the two stars), but that's about it.
As an example of the abandonment of the high standards, the stormtroopers of the early movies are replaced in firefights by combat droids. Although this is politically correct, it gives the impression that by the time of the original Star Wars movie technology had regressed, continuity people! Darth Vader in the original movies was a well defined figure of menace. In Phantom Mencae Darth Maul is exactly that, a phantom. He lacks definiton, personality and even menace (he looks ridiculous and fights like Van Dame on a sugar high). In the original movies, the comic relief (R2D2, C3PO) were useful and capable. Jar Jar Binks, the comedy relief from ""Phantom Menace"" may have been funny in a juvenile way, but he accomplishes nothing. Jeez, if the forces of good rely on guys like him no wonder the empire took over so easily! Previously, the force had been ""an energy force that surrounds us and binds the galaxies together.""  In 1976 we were all saying ""May the Force be with you.""  Now, thanks to episode I, it turns out the force is a bacterial infection, ""May disease be with you?!""  In the original movies, Luke was a kid we could all relate to because he seemed human. In this movie, Annakin Skywalker is an ace pilot, a droid inventor, pilots a fighter in combat, and he's what, 7?!? I can see 7 year olds in the audience cheering for this bit of nonsense, but what about those of us with a cohesive sense of logic? In the films all time low-point, however, Annakin is informed that despite his accomplishments, he is too old to begin traiing as a jedi. How old do you have to be, a fetus? Luke must have been positively ancient when he began his training. CONITINUITY PEOPLE!

There are apparently going to be two more follow ups to the story, where Anakin gets involved with the darkside of the force and ends up being Darth Vader. Episode one - The Phantom Menace is a great start to the classic Star Wars films, with Obi Wan Kanobi still training to become a Jedi master by his master Qui Gon Jinn (played by Liam Neeson).

It goes to show that Lucas truly shows his creative roots with these movies, as people draw different interpretations and beliefs from all of them; and no movie in history has ever done this as much as the Star Wars films have.  To me, it's not about who likes or dislikes them, it's the feel that you get when you've seen the whole story unravel.  To some, Star Wars is a film that reflects our society through the use of beautiful, galactic-wide set pieces, and the people who know Star Wars for that usually come off enjoying it, regardless of the hype and what the die-hard fans think of it.  And then there are those who look at the series as a comic book, those who seem to think this one was a little more childish than the classic trilogy, completely forgetting why many people marveled to it in the first place.  ""Phantom"" got its fair share of criticism, as did Episodes IV, V, and VI, and so does every other movie in history.  People act like ""Phantom"" was just a bad movie, because it maybe didn't gross as much as was expected, and didn't completely meet others' expectations.  But this belief only comes from the sixteen years of hype that have been following it.  Trust me, there are worse movies in the world, and ""Phantom"" didn't suffer as badly as people thought.  In my opinion, ""Phantom"" is one of the greatest examples of storytelling on-screen, and matches any of the classic films, including ""The Empire Strikes Back.""  It's no more or no less than what the past three films were, and that trend will continue with however many chapters Lucas decides to tell.
That's enough of my political views on the movie.  My job is to review, not debate.  ""The Phantom Menace"" is historically the first chapter in George Lucas' epic space opera.  In this movie, we're introduced to the height of the Old Republic, the golden age of the galaxy, the wisdom of the Jedi Knights--and in the background, we have Anakin Skywalker, the boy destined to bring balance to the mystical energy field known as the Force.  With ""Phantom"", the start of Anakin's journey becomes an important plot element that will decide his fate, something the wisdomic Jedi Knights, namely Yoda and Mace Windu, seem to understand.  In this huge galactic turmoil that plagues the planet Naboo, we also see the corruption that will mar and eventually bring the downfall of the Old Republic, as Senator Palpatine begins to manipulate anyone who gets in his way to his rise to power.  All of these elements are perfect ground for the forthcoming Episodes II and III, and serve as a basis for ""A New Hope"", ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"".
In terms of plot, ""Phantom"" mirrors Episode IV, as it serves as an introduction of what's to come.  Its main purpose is to set up the dark events that will mire the rest of the trilogy, and it does a great job on that level.  There's a lot of movie magic surrounding the mystery of this film, but its colorful atmosphere and wildly amusing characters is what makes for an entertaining film.  Lucas draws from classic film fare, like ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Flash Gordon"", to continue telling his masterful stories.  Every trace of his imagination and creativity is evident in this film, and how anyone could dream of a more classy, fantastical movie bewilders me.
If there's a downside to the film, I thought more attention could be paid to the live-action characters.  George's visual emphasis dominated the very lively world of ""Phantom"", as it always has with the original films.  I just think his direction should linger more toward his physical actors, as they're essentially just as important to the story as all the visual details.
""Phantom"" makes for a very crucial part of an entertaining and deeply involved space story.  As far as its theatrical release goes, it met all my expectations and thensome.  You really couldn't have asked for a better film for what it represents at this stage of the arching story, and for those who continue to bash it, you don't seem to look at Star Wars the same way I do, and you obviously don't fully understand the complex story George has been trying to tell for decades.  I think it was an awesome flick.",997401600,2,4351,4.669724770642202

Truly, Jar Jar is the existential everygungan, whose bumbling and occasional stumbling irritated and offended audiences everywhere.

George's excuse for my above comments? I would imagine him saying something like this - ""The script is bad because I hate writing scripts; the acting was bad because it was nearly all shot in front of a green-screen; and the CGI was so over the top because we had to take the audience's eyes away from the bad acting.""
And we can only hope that Jar Jar Binks is sliced into little pieces by a lightsabre during the opening of Episode 2 (""Attack of the Clowns .. er, Clones??? Please pass the bucket ...... ).

Like alot of people, I thought the characters were stale and Jar Jar was stupid and that the film od'd itself on computer graphics and by the end, I didn't care what the hell happened I just wanted to go home. Now mind you, I am not the biggest Star Wars fan but I do love all of the movies, have most of the old toys and love it when my nephew can quote a line or tell me the relations between the characters. Once this film was released on video (widescreen), something weird happened. Everything flowed alot better. Perhaps it was because there not claustrophobia from the hundreds occupying the theater, or I could finally hear the dialogue crystal clear, as opposed to the new and improved theater sounds, but this film was incredibaly entertaining and while I can still see some of my earlier points come up, I also know that once the series is done, I don't think people will bag on this film much. I think people are bagging on this the way they first ripped apart Back to the Future 2, until the series was complete and now it seems to be everyone's favorite. Sure some of the acting is wooden, but this film isn't supposed to be the involving story of Luke discovering his manhood and his place in the universe, but rather a political film about the unraveling of the galaxy and how everything is beginning to hit the fan. If you still can not understand Jar Jar, here's an idea... closed caption and just think his species has to die, because he or they are not in the last films. Afterwards, I rubbed my head thinking something was wrong with me--was this the same film that I bagged on when it arrived in the theaters? It was and yet everything was clearer than before--and the visuals were not in my face, but rather atmospheric on the television screen. Please, dear people--don't bag too hard because when the series is over, I'm sure you will like this one as well. .... So far this whole series was very good and I can not wait to see this epic completed--and I am not even a huge Star Wars fan but I do like to see credit where credit is due. However, I do have something to say to George Lucas about the Phantom Menace--the only reason why the Sand people shooting at the pods is funny is because we have seen A NEW HOPE--however, years from now when the series is done and kids want to watch it, it will be very hard to just start at EPISODE 1--because the injokes simply will not resonate and they may be forced to track backwards anyway.

On the other hand, you are a cynic and are going to analize the film for the 2 hours of running time, you'll hate it.
Star Wars is about having fun, laughing, and dreaming.  Episode I is just like the 3 original films in that respect.  Too many ""fans of Star Wars"" have lost the pleasure in watching the films.  It's like analyzing how the rides at Disneyland work.  Don't think, just get in the seat, take the ride and have fun.

663371,2,6303454038,"I Have seen many reviews written for this movie, 43 to be exact. Some I agree with, some I don't. Everybody is entitled to their own opinion.  I know that expectations have been a little high and people have said that if you put the expectations aside it was a good movie. I have to disagree on that. Expectations aside, it was a computerized show! It confuses me that people say that only the true star wars fans appreciate episode 1. How can I appreciate a movie that HAS a story that's put in poorly? What I mean is that the story was there, but it was put in really bad in my opinion.  Jar Jar Binks is especially annoying. Having him make stupid jokes, having all these special effects run the movie, and having all these weird aliens, you would think that George Lucas was directing this film towards little kids to ""WOWWW"" or ""Ahhhh"" about the neat fly by ships, neat planets, and a billion aliens overrun the movie.  Characters is a big complaint in the movie. The casting was awful in my opinion. Let's characterize some characters.  Queen Amidala- well dressed, looks like a goddess, no  personality, acting 3 out of 5 stars.  Princess Leia- great personality, has an interesting story esp. with her and han, acting 4 1/2 out of 5 stars (no one can beat Harrison Ford)  Jar Jar Binks- annoying, annoying, weird, obnoxious,looks completely animated, no importance to the movie, acting 1 out of 5 stars  C-3PO- (different version of jar jar) funny, annoying I will admit, though plays a much more interesting part in the trilogy, warm character, acting 5 out of 5 stars  Anakin in Episode 1- nothing interesting, all around not interesting, acting 2 out of 5 stars  Darth Vader VS. Darth Maul (hard to rate)
 Darth Maul- scary in a good way, very quiet (reserved), dark dark character, acting job 4 out of 5 stars, not of much importance though.  Darth Vader- scary, dark character. has the classic breathing sound, unlike Darth Maul who just is remembered for the neat designs on his face. Huge importance to the story, neatest character out of all of star wars, acting 5 out of 5 stars!
Overall I wouldn't say episode 1 is a horrible movie or really bad. It is poorly done out. The things that need to happen is less aliens, more of a story,  a good sense of a relationship with the characters, and much less special effects. In polls that I have seen, The Empire Strikes Back is rated top. It has the best story, everything from romance, evil, drama, powerful parts. It also has the least amount of weird places and least amount of weird aliens. Episode 6 almost always followed in the polls. And Episode 1 and episode 4 kinda go back and forth, although I don't know why episode 4 is rated so low. Maybe since it was the oldest.

663372,5,6303454038,"I will begin by saying if you think you could do better then knock yourself out!  The first Star Wars was written as a stand alone movie with expectations of earning only about $35 million.  Instead, and to everyone's surprise, Star Wars has grossed nearly One Billion Dollars world wide.  The Phantom Menace also grossed close to one billion world wide...(Gee! It appears someone liked this film!)  The Phantom Menace is written as 1/3 of a complete story arc and Star Wars was made to stand alone in case it bombed.  Personall I am amazed at how many fans out there are quick to judge this film.  I proves that Americans are fickled and just plain spoiled when it comes to entertainment.  Many fans fail to realize that all of the movies cronicle the rise, fall, and REDEMPTION of not only Darth Vader but humanity in general.  We see the apathy of people and the corruption of goverment and how both are blinded to the cunning and ravenous forces of darkess eager to consume them both.  The Star Wars Saga has Biblical similarities with regards to the rise and fall of an anti-christ like figure ( Palpatine ) and the tyranical, Beast like, govenment (the Empire) he imposes using anger, fear, and agression. ( sound familiar? Look at recent headlines ... Global Union anyone?!)  At any rate no movie is perfect yet this film has something good for everyone, including the younger members of a family.  It is clean, devoid of profanity, gratuitous sex, and graphic violence.  A true rarity for Hollywood ( perhaps that is why most critics didn't like it?! not enough raunch for them)
Of those I know, who said they hated this film none could give me a tangible reason why!  Nor could they tell me what they would have done differently!  We all had such high expectations!  Addionally, everyone I know who was disappointed with the film as both the wide and standard version on video tape and can't seem to wait for it to be released on DVD!(?) My Mother, who is not a big sci fi fan, loved the movie and cant wait until 19 May 2002!
Warning!!!!! Possible Spoiler ahead !!!!!!
The mystery of the Force has not been diminished by the inclusion of the Midiclorients explained by Qui Gon in SWTPM.  It is the guess of this fan that Lucas mentioned this issue and its connection to the Force force since the next movie deals with clones.  It is a logical deduction that if you clone a Jedi or Sith you will have a Jedi or Sith clone complete and with powers intact.  I forsee in the third installment, after Anakin turns to the Dark Side and becomes a Sith, that the now self proclaimed Emporer (Palpatine) will have Vader Cloned... Hence the true problem in the clone wars! ...In episode 2 you find out that there are numerous Jedi...too numerous for one person to eliminate.  So the cloned Vaders scour the galaxy for Jedi and eliminate them thus confirming Obi-Wans statement "" Vader hunted down and killed the Jedi"" from a certain point of view of course.
I said all of that to say this.  It is not over! Most of the ill perceptions an reviews of this movie are premature since it is less than half complete.  I would wager against my new racing pod that everyone who said they hated this movie more than likely has it in there library and are equally or more likely, chomping at the Bit for episode two's release in less than a year!

This movie is awonderful spectacle that, I think, tried to please too many people at once. A victim of it's own popularity, I suppose. Don't get me wrong, I like the movie... hell, I LOVE the movie. I was just aware of too many things that seemed to be meant to ""hook"" a particular audience. Episode four drew it's strength from mythological archetypes (The young hero on a quest, the mystical mentor, the ""rogue samurai"", etc.) while this one... well.. marketing surveys. (the adorable high energy star-struck kid, the goofy comic relief side-kick... etc). Also, I'm not sure it's wise to mess around with that whole ""virgin birth"" (or similar idea therein) thing with Anakin. Lots of little plot and character inconsistencies, and... *ahem... certain cast members who just bugged the hell out of me.  Not to slight it too much. I'm really not writing this to bash Lucas. Some of my favorite action sequences of the decade are in this film. There's plenty of high-octane Star Wars fun. The visuals are, of course, spectacular... first rate!  And I do not, as some maintain, believe that the movie became an excuse to spotlight ILM's capability.  What did you want?  a Star Wars movie with ""subtle"" special effects? Natalie Portman is particularly good in her role. Oh, and just the IDEA of Darth Maul had me drooling to see this movie (And I was so NOT dissapointed with him when he arrived). Also, we see some of the basic premises defined (well, defined for those of us who didn't get around to reading the books)  Things like:  We know what the Jedi can do, but WHO are they and what is their role in the grand scheme of things?

The style is all wrong because none of the original designers or artists were invlolved. And just how much CGI can one squeeze into a movie without it hitting overkill. Lucas as created here a behemoth of a movie that is both inconsistent, unengaging and unintelligent. His problem is that back in the 70s he, along with Spielberg, Coppola, de Palma, Scorcese et al had something significant to contribute to cinema at an artistic level. They all accomplished that, and all we have left are the assimilated remains of their expended genius.

I keep on hearing all this stuff about how it being impossible to beat the original trilogy and how true Star Wars fans will like episode 1.  Yeah right.  The true Star Wars fans will be the ones who like a good story and great acting (original trilogy) rather than watching all the neat stuff George Lucas can do with the technology making weird looking aliens and neat looking ships (episode 1). It boggles my mind to see how true fans would like episode 1 the most. Maybe I have different tastes. Sure, there were great fighting sequences, great ships, neat planets, neat costumes, weird aliens and much more! But does a great movie rely on just that kind of stuff. I have taken polls on the people's most favorite star wars movie, and almost all the time The Empire Strikes Back was the most liked. I am not saying this should be everyone's favorite. I am just trying to get this point across. The Empire Strikes Back DID have the least amount of weird creatures, it also used the least amount of big technology, the people were real, and it also had a great story. So do the next two movies that are coming out really need to rely on all the digital stuff or can't George Lucas remodel off of the trilogy. People's expectations might have been a little high on episode 1, and it might have been impossible to mount to the original trilogy. BUT to me George Lucas seemed like impressing the audiences with the high flying, loud, technology cities, which is all a special effects show.  I have noticed that I can feel I have a special bond with the characters of the trilogy, because they are GREAT actors and have good, interesting personalities. It's hard to get aquainted with stupid characters like Jar Jar. Also to me the main cast seemd quite weak and boring. I just couldn't get in with the movie.  Lastly, the story was really weak. Anakin was esp. weak. I mean him having no idea what he is doing in that ship and somehow managing to blue up that space droid control station is weird to me.

Ok with that said lets get on to the review.  The movie itself was a decent movie, but it didn't live up to the name of Star Wars.  The acting was pretty good, though Anakin couldn't have done a better job.  A few hard core Star Wars fans might notice every historical mistake made, such as the alterations in some peoples' ages and the C-3P0 problem... but other than that, no one else will notice.  The movie does more for the Star Wars fan than it does for the average movie goer.  Most Star Wars fans looked upon Phantom Menace as a menace, tarnishing the name of StarWars with the ever annoying Jar Jar Binks.  This character seems to be out of place, way out of line, and just unnecessary comic relief that was never needed in any of the other movies.
I wouldn't suggest this movie unless you are a Star Wars fan.  Though the soundtrack is good and the pod racing scene was great, there isn't much you can get out of the movie other than historical data on the Star Wars universe, and unless you're a fan, you probably don't care about the historical value.  If you saw it in the theaters and liked it enough to see it a second time, then you proably got everything you will out of it.  Renting it might not work for you, because the one great thing about it was it's Big Screen production, and a 45"" TV with stereo won't cut it (Though a theater system with a 16:9 super screen might fall just Shy of the Imax i saw it on).

I'm gonna deal with the dissappointing stuff first, in order to end on a lighter tone.
Dissappointing:
- Lack of story-line. The first three movies (I refuse to think of this movie as Star Wars 1. The original is part 1 in my book) were following a closely interwoven story-line. I was expecting this movie to add to that. Build up characters, and start with the basics. It did, in a way, but I was expecting more of it.
- Annakin. I'm amazed this kid lived to his age. He's way too annoying. ""Yeah"", ""Cool"". He says that modern-kid stuff way too often. Mom COULD have drowned him when he was younger. But nooo.
- Jar Jar. Leave this double jar on the shelf. ""How rude"". How I'd love to grab him by that big neck of his, and tie his ears around it. 'Nuff said.
- Commerce. We all saw what commerce was when the first (See? Told you I didn't regard this one as the first) 'trilogy' was released. Thing is: Everybody who saw the older Star Wars movies and loved them is now older. Yet this movie was totally made for kids. (See JarJar and Anakin). We, the true old-timer (25 IS old) fans would buy the toys anyway. Heck, we have tons more cash to spend then 22 years ago. No need to have made them so annoying that we'd prolly end up tossing them out the window or hand rags over them to keep from gagging. Everything looks like it's sweet and huggable. We know kids are little adults, but they forget about the adult kids...
But, there's some good things in the movie too.
Awesome:
- The fight. Like another reviewer said: ""The best action ever on TV"".
- The Special-effects. I sometimes wonder when we definatly won't be able to tell the difference between something 'real' and something 'computer-made'. Some of them are a bit overdone, but overall, I'd say the line ""Where's my jaw?"" pretty much sums it up.
- Extras. This DVD is packed with them. Kudos to Lucasfilm for that.
- 1/3. Seeing this is the first one of the new trilogy (Ha. did it again!), maybe the Lucasfilm team will listen to all the negative reviews, and think about their long-term fans a little more next time. Granted, the first (!!) three movies were ALSO aimed for kids and commerce, but at least adults also got enjoyment. Now, I think most of the adults were trying to hold down their lunch because of all the sweet kiddie-stuf. AND we'll get to see more of Natalie Portman. (I vote we get full close-ups of her and Anakin going at is!).
- Mace Windu. YEAY! Samuel L. Jackson rules!
- This is not the end. For two reasons. 1. It's only a movie. My life won't end; I'll just watch the old three (Ha!) movies again and again and again. 2. There's two more to come up. Lucas can make up for this one, plus we'll get more of the storyline.

663472,2,6303454038,"My husband and I went to see ""The Phantom Menace"" on our honeymoon in Marco Island. We had both seen and enjoyed the original Star Wars movies (well, he really didn't care much for the Ewoks). So we were eagerly anticipating the ""prequel"".  My husband liked the movie, but I was disappointed.  First, almost all of the characters (with the exception of Darth Maul) acted ""wooden"" - you really didn't care about them - even if they survived or not.  Second, they really should've developed the main characters roles a little more - like knowing something about their past and how they're important to the lives of those they interact with (like between Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan).  Third, while computer animation is a great thing, too much of it (which this movie had alot of) can take away from the ""realism"" of the scenes.  Now, don't get me wrong - the movie wasn't a total loss:  I loved the duel between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan and the racing scenes felt like I was playing POD, but I felt the movie was missing something.  Maybe I expected it to be along the vein of the first 3, but it could have been alot better.  But I will buy ""The Phantom Menace"" when it comes out on DVD for my husband because at least someone in the household will enjoy it.",996105600,3,1262,4.456521739130435
663473,3,6303454038,"Well, I came in and read a few reviews, none over 3 stars sadly.  When I started reading the one star reviews I was immediately ready to disregard anything they said.  But, after I read the whole thing, I saw the points they made, and actually, they were really good points.  In Star Wars, we have an all powerful evil we have to destroy of it will soon take over the galaxy.  The Death Star is destroyed, much to the relief of everyone by Luke Skywalker.  In the Empire Strikes Back, the same evil is back, and this time the evil wins, and Han Solo is lost to Jaba.  In Return of the Jedi, the Death Star is back, and supposedly it is ""out of order"" but as we find out it is ""Very operational"".  Again it is destroyed by our good friend Lando, and everything turns out for the best.
Then, we go back to the beginning.  We have an evil force, but it's not so big and it's not so bad.  Most of this movie takes place on land, not in space where we all hoped, and even some underwater.  We meet Darth Vader, or Anakin Skywalker, and he sure does need to take some acting classes.  George Lucas's best accomplishment is finding out how to make young Anakin into an older Anakin, and a different actor.
... It had no plot, and it gave the watchers what they wanted, action.  ""Breakthrough""?  I think not, the plot in the last 3 films was what made us watch this movie, and sadly you left us wanting more.  I'm not devestated, it's just a movie, and I will watch it again, because let's face it, that light sabre scene at the end was just awesome, the fight choriography was great.  The only reason I give this movie 3 stars is for the action and the past.  I'm sure the final film in 2005 will be the best, it has to be.

663477,3,6303454038,Isn't it odd that George Lucas claimed that he would not release Star Wars on DVD because he felt fans and viewers were being exploited?  This is comming from the mastermins who released the original Star Wars how many times?  My lord every year we had another reason to buy the same old trilogy just because it had a new cover.  Well here we are again and it appears George has given in to the DVD craze.  I guess I am a hypocrite for signing the petition to get it on DVD.  Anyway I am always wondering what George will do next.  To be quite honest he has been surprising me the past few years.  First off he re-releases (And ruins) the original three films and then creates this mediocre film.  Yes the action and graphics were exciting and yes the acting was lacking. (What was the point of Samuel L Jackson and Liam Neeson anyway?  Both of them acted as though they were dying and uninterested.)  What I find most compelling about this film and the subsequent release of it on DVD is that George really got lucky back in 77.  He wrote some stories that are not too different from many of the classical Sci Fi stories and got in touch with some great film writers and directors.  That is where we get the first three films.  But please George spare us on the next 2 because now that you are solo it is obvious you have no idea what you are doing.  The films are too childish and simple which is odd because in your books you can't come to a simple conclusion or come to a point without boring the reader with pages or drabble.  Anyone ever read his stuff???  If you are still alive I am amazed. The Star Wars films will always be my favorite films of all time but I must admit I was let down by this prequel and it could very well be the last film George ever makes if only to spare us true fans the agony.  Thanks for hearing out my complaining.,995500800,,1850,4.195467422096317
663478,5,6303454038,"This movie is tied with Star Trek II as my favorite movie of all time.  The original Star Wars Trilogy was good, but Episode one was unbelievable.  The special effects, the best fight scene in cinema history, the Vader mythos origin begins, and Obi Wan Kanobi (Ewan McGregor) made a huge breakthrough performance, he really overshadows Neeson (Qui Gon Jin) as the heroine of the story.  Yoda is cool as ever, and the Princess is super hot. The SFX are breathtaking, much better than the original trilogy. Although many fans didn't like this move consider the following comparisons:
Original Star Wars vs. Episode 1 Luke Skywalker:  Dreamer who wants to be a Jedi, but he's really mundane and wimpy, looks and acts like the kid who got beat up in high school.  Jedi Savior?  Bwahahwwahhhbwahhhaa. Episode 1 Counterpart:  Obi Wan Kanobi McGregor acts like a Jedi: cool, intelligent, fearless.  His fight scene with Darth Maul is the best fight scene ever.
Darth Maul vs. Darth Vader
Maul is just plain bad, he's evil, and kicks butt, and he doesen't have to breathe heavy, and wear all that crap like Vader.  Don't get me wrong, Vader is a sci fi classic and legend, but did he really seem evil?  Did he really seem intimidating?  Maul takes on two awsome Jedis, Vader couldn't even take wimpy weeney Luke, the wannabe Jedi, Maul vs. Luke... Get ready to join the force Luke.... Hans Solo vs. Oui Gon Ok, I know Han is not a Jedi, but I needed somebody to compare to.  Han is so bad, he's like the ultimate gunsliner, but he can't act, and the guy seemed like a wimp like he does in all other movies...and people complain about Jar Jar's bad comedy... How about Chewbacca(Arrgghhharrrrg)  Solo:  ""Laugh it up pukeball, Or furball, whatever, it was cheesey, and not funny. Original Trilogy highlight:  Alec Guiness, as Obi Wan, great actor, and performance, one of the main highlights of the original film.

663479,4,6303454038,"When the world ran out of Fairy Tales, one man set forth to create a legend that would never be forgotten.  In a time when a world needed heroes, he showed us to look within ourselves and use the force to overcome the menacing evil. From the people that shaped an entire culture, George Lucas and the team of Industrial Light and Magic, a new chapter emerges from the shadows of the past.  The beginning to the most famous movie series worldwide, unlocks the secrets of the events leading up to that moment when Darth Vader appears on screen for the first time in '78.  ILM pushes the envelope once more to tell the tale of the Boy Who Would Be Vader.  In an attempt to protect the young Queen Amidala from the attacking Trade Federation, Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Queen and her crew make an emergency stop on Tatooine.  While trying to find replacement parts, they stumble upon this boy genius who is extremely strong with the Force.  After proving his abilities in the Pod Race, Qui-Gon Jinn believes him to be the chosen one and takes him back to Corruscant before the Jedi Counsel so the boy can be taught.  The council rejects Qui-Gon's request so he takes Anikin under his wing in spite.  When the Sith, thought long extinct, return to the universe, they pose a menace to all who oppose them.  The Trade Federation is ordered by the Sith to take over the Planet of Naboo.  To save her people, Queen Amidala and Jar Jar Binks pursuede the Gungan Warriors to fight along side them and save their homeworld.  The 2 Jedi engage a Sith Lord in the bowels of the city for a Lightsaber battle like noneother has seen.  Obi-Wan graduates from student to master and Takes the Boy to train as his student.  This chapter leaves questions in your head and leaves you craving for the Next Epic Film in the Series.

663551,4,6303454038,"Trying to create a prequel to the immensly popular Star Wars films is akin to stripping off your clothes and running naked through the mall - some will be grateful and pleased, others will cover their eyes and scream 'THE HORROR, THE HORROR'. But either way, it takes guts to even make the attempt. From the first scene it's obvious that Lucas isn't simply trying to cash in on the Star Wars name. He is trying to provide a backstory, a new legend for today's youth who have grown up watching the three original masterpieces but have never had one to call their own. What Lucas gives us is a mixed blessing, a film whose best scenes are riveting, heart-pounding fun but whose worst scenes are embarrasing and tedious. The acting is relatively non-existant. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor sleepwalk through most of their scenes (and McGregor's Alec Guiness impersonation is wholly aggravating) and young Jake Lloyd is as unbelieveable as comic co-star Jar Jar Binks. But there are a good number of performances which hit their marks. Natalie Portman's young and brave Queen Amidala and Ian McDiarmid's creepy old Senator Palpatine are both well-played. But the movie's best character is the vicious Darth Maul ('X-Men's Ray Park) whose face adorned hundreds of toy boxes but has relatively little screen time in the actual film. The story line is a bit muddled, but no matter. We are meant to take this film at surface level and it's best that we do. It's hard to get excited about this first chapter when we all know how it turns out and are really just waiting for Episode 3 so we can all see young Anakin become the Darth Vader we all know and love. I can't say I thought this movie ranked up there with the other three films but I can say that it was a good start to the new trilogy, laying in line the events and characters who will guide us through the remaining two prequels. Hopefully when it is all said and done we will have a truly great new trilogy to hold up and call our own. After all, 'Return Of The Jedi' wasn't exactly the greatest ending for the original three but it certainly didn't diminish the previous two films. So maybe the next two will be PERFECT. And this and 'Jedi' will serve as the two less then savory bookmarks for the trilogy... like a sandwich you can't help but enjoy... despite the two slightly stale pieces of bread holding it all together.",995155200,11,2377,4.55607476635514

The first quarter of the film is almost painful, as viewers witness Lucas getting his directorial chops back.  The Trade Federation are my biggest gripe, they are painfully benign villians that are shadows of their imperial descendants.  There is little to no character development, the Jedi's seem vaguely interesting, but no effort is made to endear them to us.  Naboo is a generic, courtly world. I wince when reminded of the flatuating beasts. But, in spite of itself, the film begins to breathe with the pod race, which captures the rebel spirit of the first films.  Lucas then tantilizes with the enigmatic Darth Maul, truly the only evil presence in the film.  The lightsaber duel that concludes the film is poetic violence.  Finally, the mysterious clues provided by Mace Windu and Yoda point to a much darker, more engaging second film.  Perhaps then the Star Wars pedigree can be restored to its previous distinction.",995155200,,1103,5.016483516483516

Some people say it was nearly as bad as Dune (which if done today, whoops it has been, wouldn't and wasn't that bad). Some said they didn't like Jar-Jar. I liked this movie, saw it with seven people in the theatre on the second day (saw it at 1 in the afternoon when everyone had gone back to school and work, no line mind you) and actually liked Jar-Jar. I look at it like this: A lot of people didn't like Episode IV when it came out in theatres. This is a growing pain for Lucas. A New Hope did things no other movie had done before it, and Episode I did too. I look back at the original series and Harrison Ford didn't even actually start acting until most of the way into ANH, actually about the scene when he met Princess Leia did he actually act. If Lucas is true to form, then this will be a hiccup that starts a new trend. So in shorter words: the plot was a little cheesy, the acting a little foupa, and the action not so exciting at times, but definitely worth the 7 times seeing it in the theatre and the almost worn out cassete tape I paid for it.",995068800,,1131,4.008849557522124

Little did we know when The Phantom Menace was first released, that the Trade Federation was a small faction of a larger group of rebellious trade factions that would eventually become the Confederacy of Independent Systems.
Nor did we know that during these events, on a far away planet, that millions of Clone Troopers were being created from a deadly bounty hunter and Jedi Master.
The Phantom Menace introduces us to the characters that would shape the galaxy in years to come. Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) is the wise Queen of Naboo who is being silently manipulated by the Sith Lord, Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). She would later rise to become one of the most influential Senators in the Galactic Senate. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is the Jedi Padawan who thinks he can train the young Chosen One, Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) against the wishes of the wise Jedi Master, Yoda (Frank Oz).
We also meet a young Jar Jar Binks(Ahmed Best), the character who later becomes an important player in the Loyalist Committee and the Clone Wars. Jar Jar is the last reminder of an innocent galaxy that is about to be gripped by the formidable Empire during the events of Episode III - VI.
We also can't forget the introduction of Padme Naberrie and Anakin Skywalker - an introduction that will later have grave consequences for the Jedi and the Galaxy.

663683,4,6303454038,"As with all Star Wars (or science fiction) movies, the critics were way too harsh in casting judgement on the Phantom Menace.  Before you can really make an accurate apprasial of how effective this movie was, you have to distance yourself from the expectations generated by the brilliant original Star Wars Trilogy.  In making the Phantom Menace, Lucas had the difficult problem of being true to the original while still statisfying the expectations of a more modern audience.  On top of that, there were certain things that had to be said, set-up, and introduced in the Phantom Menace to provide groundwork for later sequels.  Considering how many objects Lucas was juggling, he did a tremendous job. The Phantom Menace looks as technologicly beautiful as any movie ever made.  The special effects are amazing and, at least in this category, the Phantom Menace far outpaces the original series.  Every scene is spectacular on a scope the original trilogy could only dream of.  There are a myriad of bizzare and interesting characters floating, not just in the center of the frame, but around the corners in flashes and only for split seconds.  Just that aspect alone warrants multiple viewings. The performances are rock solid, Liam Neeson is perfect in the role of a jedi master, and takes his cues with an appreciative nod to the great Alec Guiness whose performance as the original Obi-Wan Kenobi is the backbone of the whole star wars series.  Ewan McGreggor is marvelous too and it will be very entertaining to see him in an expanded role in the further sequels. The criticisms of this film have been that the characters are too two dimensional, that the plot is too similar to the origninals, and that too much of the action takes place in a political forum.  My answer is that the characters are developed, it is just done extremely subtly and with minor gestures and choice of words rather than in-your-face gestures, certain plotlines are similar but in an attempt to make the movie true to the originals some overlap is inevitable, and the political aspect is, and has always been, a major component in this fantasy series and so was unavoidable.  In short, the Phantom Menace is a spectacular movie.  Although it doesn't quite capture the nostalgia of the original Star Wars, it suceeds admirably in continuing the story without disturbing the pedistal the first movies established.  As with all Star Wars movies, there is a lot more subtly going on than any critic is likely to recognize.  Furthermore, it is unfair to judge the Phanom Menace after only one or two viewings when most people have seen the original trilogy numerous times and have picked up every little nuance and detail.  The original series seems rich on the strength of those multiple viewings and multiple discoveries, it is unfair to consider the Phantom Menace less until it has been given an equal examination.",994723200,,2896,4.893660531697342
663684,2,6303454038,"P>Yes, I am a big Star Wars fan, and I highly anticipated the arrival of this film, in spite of the year or so beforehand of commercial marketing fodder (which gave me a really bad feeling).  But contrary to popular misconception, my reason for not liking the movie isn't because my expectations were too high.  It's because, as forgiving as I would like to be, there is a certain threshold beneath which my expectations refuse to go for any movie.  And this one dropped below radar on many fronts.
But I'll start with the positive.  As many have mentioned, and I will agree wholeheartedly, the special effects are groundbreaking.  I tip my hat to Mr. Lucas on this front.  It's something for which he has a real knack.  If you're into the movie for that, I imagine the DVD will be everything you could ask for!  It looks like a fairly complete package for the effects and technical details-inclined.  And it's DVD.  Could you have hoped for a better medium for Star Wars 20 years ago?  The cinematography is also excellent, and definitely met my expectations.  Really, from a technical, engineering standpoint, this movie is pretty darned good.
Unfortunately, this seems to be the only focus of the movie.  The plotline?  It's not that it's slow.  It's far too uninvolved, superficial, basic, lacking in any intricacy or sophistication.  Maybe there is a plethora of inside information that I am missing due to not researching the movie premise beforehand.  I'm sorry, but that's still inexcusable, and I would say the same even if I did have that information, because it's simply not a fair assumption to make in a movie.
The characters?  Again, poorly developed, one dimensional, and uninteresting.  I think that Darth Maul had amazing potential to be interesting, if they hadn't sat him behind the Emperor the whole time, grunting and looking mean.  And what can be said about Jar Jar Binks?  That character is obviously thrown in as the ""kiddie"" element, to attract the younger audience, or as some absent-minded throw-in for humor.  Whatever the case, the character is just that: thrown in.  And yet he survives for the entire length of the movie?  This really highlights the ""manufactured"" sense of the movie to me.
The dialog?  This is perhaps the single biggest failure of the movie.  This is why I can't blame the actors and actresses completely for the character failure.  They aren't really given much to work with.  It's too bad, because it's really a fantastic cast.  What more can be said on this front?  I feel like I spent more time thinking about this review than the writers did in thinking about the script.
In summary, this movie was great technically, but a complete failure artistically.  If there were half stars, I would give this movie 2 1/2 on those merits: (5 + 0) / 2.  As it is, I rounded down, since I think the intangibles of coming up with an emotionally moving screenplay and dialog are harder to come by than even the most amazing of special effects.  I wish I could say that it's enough for the movie to be technically proficient, but that's only half of a movie for me.",994636800,,3106,4.703153988868275
663685,2,6303454038,"It's been said before but I'll say it again.  If Lucas had spent nearly as much time on story and character development as he did on computer generated whimsy, this may have been more up to par with the ""original"" trilogy.  Hence, when I was working at my video store and they gave us the exciting news that ""Episode I"" was finally to make it's long-awaited arrival to DVD, my response was an overwhelming ""So?""
Extra-features, commentaries, making-of's, all that jazz doesn't make up for the fact that this movie is a sure sign that somewhere between Jedi and Phantom, Lucas got a little too caught up in the business of keeping track of his royalties than keeping track of his imagination.
Sure, standing alone, it's a decent picture (I still say Galaxy Quest was that year's best sci-fi release), but when held up next to it's three big brothers...well it's kinda like holding a Pokemon Pikachu wristwatch won from a crane game next to Big Ben.",994636800,8,947,4.664670658682635

The supposedly great computer generated special effects made the film look like a cheesy computer game. Worst of all, Jar-Jar Binks was so annoying and I certainly feel that Darth Mau would have immediately increase the rating on the film if he would have cut Jar-Jar into pieces in the first scene. They no longer do things like they used to, in terms of quality. The first 3 Starwars film will always be great, however, Episod 1 is certainly a Menace for the Star Wars collection. Hopefully Episod 2 is a lot better, I am certainly not looking forward to seeing Jar-Jar, unless of course it involves the new Darth Mau doing us a favour, sending him back to where he came from, below ground level.",994464000,,821,4.585034013605442
663687,4,6303454038,"Sure, ""The Phantom Menace"" isn't as good as the other movies, but it has its moments. The pod race, the three-way lightsaber duel, etc. I do believe that this is a great film, yet the weakest of the Star Wars films (don't get me wrong, there all great). Although it lacks Han Solo's sarcasim and cockiness, ""TPM"" is a diamond in the rough. For those of you that keep bashing this good film, get a life!!!",994377600,,404,4.328947368421052

Yes, we could do without him. And yes, some of the acting is a bit dry. But come on, for any fans of Star Wars that know the characters, know the story, and just know the Star Wars galaxy, this is a great film to watch. The podrace is just incredible, and if that is not enough for you, you will LOVE the lightsaber duel between the Jedi and the sith at the end. The characters are well introduced into the Star Wars world with maybe the exception of Anakin Skywalker (Jake Loyd is not all that good in this film). But Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are all very good.
The DVD is loaded with extras that I'm sure will enhance this spectacle. I plan on getting it when it comes out and I'm really looking forward to seeing the cut scenes and documentaries. Bottom line- It's not as good as the original Star Wars, but it works.",994377600,3,1017,4.141414141414141
663689,1,6303454038,"It's just not the same. I mean how many people want to sit at a 2 hour movie just to see special effects?? Did George Lucas get side-tracked having all this technology now to work with and not focusing as much on the actual story? The story was there, but the way he fit it into the movie. I kept on waiting for a powerful or exciting part to happen, but it never happened. The person you can always count on though is John Williams. He did a fantastic job with the music yet again. Anyways, Jar Jar took the place of C-3PO, by being the annoying character. HOWEVER, C-3PO played a much more interesting part. Jar jar was just plain annoying. Plus the movie at some points looks like a little kids movie. Jar Jar making stupid jokes and Anakin having no idea what he is doing and out of the blue blowing up the space ship is a little weird. There was not that relationship you can feel you have with the characters. There were the romantic (han and leia), the emotional, and powerful scenes in ANH, ESB, and ROJ. I can pick my favorite character out of the original trilogy, which would probably be either han or leia. I can only pick the most annoying in episode 1. I have seen mixed reviews about this movie. I can only say that the people who liked it weren't so much interested in the story but in the neat ships and great technology they had. I would like a great story and a powerful ending, such as in A new hope,  Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The casting needs to be worked on also in the phantom menace. Plus, how many weird looking creatures could George Lucas fit into episode 1??? My favorite is the Empire STrikes Back because it had the least amount of weird aliens in it. It actually had mostly real people! I just hope the George Lucas realizes that he didn't please as many people with his JUST special effects show as he might think. I would suggest going back and do it how you did the TRILOGY!",994377600,23,1928,4.26775956284153

As hard and nearly impossible as it would be for George Lucas or anyone else to make a movie that's anywhere near as good as the original Star Wars and/or Empire Strikes Back, this was embarrassingly bad and only a ten year old could like it. What an insult that millions of movie-goers paid to watch a two-hour toy commercial. There was absolutely no story. Something about a Queen? Whatever. Americans could care less about having a Queen. Darth Vader was the greatest villain of all time. It was bad enough that he became Mr. Goodie Two-shoes in Return of the Jedi. Now seeing him as a little brat is just annoying. Okay so the effects are good but who even cares anymore? Effects nowadays are a dime a dozen. In 1977, yes it was impressive. Now it's just expected. George Lucas should've been honest with himself as an artist and admitted his script wasn't as good as it needed to be. How could someone as brilliant as he is overlook what made Star Wars so exciting in the first place? He himself once said that ""Without a good story a movie is boring."" Sounds like he was describing this movie. He should have brought a fresh new writer on-board to co-write this; someone determined to make a good movie like George Lucas once was. Everything in Hollywood has become so predictically formulaic that the once rule-breaking rebels like George Lucas have sold-out to the system in the name of being politically correct and to appeal mainly to the pre-puberty crowd. The original trilogy appealed to all ages but this one doesn't even try to. The cast is very weak and desperately needs a Harrison Ford or a Carrie Fischer to carry it. Liam Neeson looks embarrassed and bored out of his mind. He probably was and who could blame him? .",994377600,,1775,4.567398119122257

From a technical standpoint, it suffers from an excess of special effects. It seems to me that having major characters such as Jar Jar exist only in digital form is a crutch; but a crutch for what, I cannot tell you. From the standpoint of the script, having young Skywalker destroy the federation's command ship by flying inside and blowing it up is a lazy rip-off of the first (chronologically speaking) Star Wars movie.

I always root for the bad guys most of the time. The special effects where excellent and the story seemed to move along very nicely. Although, I would have liked a little more information on a few things. I am sure that in Episode II my questions will be answered. Liam Neeson did an excellent job as a Jedi Knight or master. I really like how the whole first three episodes surround Anikan Skywalker. The Lightsaber Duel had to have been the best in the whole series. We'll see who the big villain in Episode II will be. My wife went with me to this movie opening day and it was a lot of fun. She liked it just as much as I did. Although, she thought the Pod Race was the best part of the movie.

Thus, I was incredibly excited to learn of the newest installment in this epic.  I drove 5 hours in order to view it on the largest indoor screen in the midwest, expecting George Lucas to dazzle me again.
What a shock to see the piece ... he offered up for our ""pleasure""!  Jar Jar Binks was amusing for about 30 seconds, and I don't know where they got the kid to play the young Annikin, but he was horrid!  My dog can act better than him.  The Princess fall in love with him, I don't think so!  The mother character could have used about 15 minutes more dialogue, she at least had potential to be interesting.  And where was Owen?  Annikin's brother?  Did Lucas not think we wouldn't remember the previous movies which so consumed our young lives?  And why did he have to make ""The Force"" some alien presence?  He could of just left it as the binding power of creation and life.  Georgey Boy needed to give up some of his control on this and allow others to guide the story line a little, making sure the glaring flaws were kept out.  He also should have brought Lawrence Kasdan back to help craft a decent script, the dialogue was really weak.

I am completely intrigued with how this is going to play out, the connection between Episodes 4-6 and 1-3.  So much food for thought and speculation is provided in this new film.  As a Star Wars fan, I thouroughly enjoyed this movie, but I believe it stands as well as a fine film in its own right.

Expectations were phenomenonally high and critics were not quiet about the fact that they weren't pleased.  However, the movie, when viewed without these distractions, is an achievement in it's own right.
First of all,the obvious:visual effects.  The wizards at Industrial Light and Magic outdid themselves.  Whether it was the CGI of the droid army or the wonders of Coruscant, from the light saber duel at the end of the movie to the pod race, the effects were mind blowing.
A lot of criticism was aimed at the plot of the movie, which didn't move as fast as some would have liked.  We must remember that this is the first episode, akin to the opening chapter of a novel.  Lucas must spend time introducing us to the characters and setting the stage for what is to come.  We see Darth Sidious (aka the Emperor/ aka Senator Palpatine) manipulating events to suit some plot which we are not yet privy to.  We also learn how it is that the Jedi accepted the person who would ultimately lead to their fall from grace and near destruction: Anakin Skywalker.
The best thing about this movie is the fact that it looked and felt just like a Star Wars movie.  After more than 15 years since the release of Episode VI it was great to hear the music and see the rolling introduction.",993859200,3,1385,4.574898785425101

TPM's special-efects were fascinating, they were far better than Star Wars: A New Hope and possibly The Empire Strikes back (Don't hurt me, it's just my opinion) but it resembled  The Return of the Jedi, as far as effects go.

There were scenes and dialogue that were certainly unnesessary and caused more overal confusion than good. However, the story is actually very complicated, and the underlying premise is repeated throughout the film many times. There are many references in the movie that circumscribe the actual story. I had to actually watch it twice to understand the entire thing. Again, I believe this was due to poor editing. When I first saw this movie in the theater, many people still did not understand who the Phantom Menace was at the end of the film. I felt that the Director had made that painfully evident, even though IQ's do seem to have droped sharply since George Lucas has been away.  Regardless, I hope that the next installment will be more ""adult"" than the first atempt, and that editing will be more careful, and the script more straightforward. The special effects were all Star Wars, they were neither overbearing like those in Matrix and the recent Tomb Raider, nor were they subtle.

I know that he had to go for a young audience so he could continue the Star Wars phenomenon through the next generations, but he could have settled for aiming at +13 year olds, not for 4 and 5 year olds.
This movie has a completely dull plotline that starts running until some fifteen minutes before it ends, the acting (specially Jake Lloyd`s) is pretty lousy with some exceptions, and the only really good thing are the amazing special effects and soudtrack.
I ratted this DVD and it hasn`t even come out,and eventough I think it bites I will have to get it to complete my Star Wars collection.
I hope Episode 2 is a lot better (but again, I doubt it), and for telling you the truth I could have lived with only episodes IV, V, and VI.",993427200,2,1301,4.536170212765957

You have to remember that The Return of the Jedi means that ANAKIN comes back from the dark side of the force, so the whole movie it's about ANAKIN and his offspring, but mainly ANAKIN. I also think that Lucas took too long to release the DVD. I can't wait to have them both in my hands and enjoy the movie with full quality, great sound and new footage while I wait till Lucas wants to release the Original Trilogy on DVD and complete the episode II. I already have the VHS version, and I will enjoy the movie even more now on DVD. To all the people that haven't seen any episode of this movie, go ahead, and see how Anakin becomes a bad guy, and the circumstances that force him to rethink his behaviour and redeem with himself, his friends and family. This movie is a MUST for your family. The special effects, comic relief, and other stuff, are a plus, not the main reason to see the movie. The main reason is the Plot itself.",993427200,,1106,4.148837209302326
663951,2,6303454038,"You know, I'm the type of guy who enjoys his DVD perks; deleted scenes and alternate endings are what I live for. Character bios and director commentaries are great too, if done well. These are the things that make a DVD you want to buy, rather than rent. look at ""Dogma"": 100 minutes of deleted scenes! Yikes! Plus candid commentary about the pitfalls of making this film. Not that you have to watch them all, but at least they're there if you want them.
I don't see this happening with ""TPM"".  First, His Greatness has held off way too long on bringing out the DVD version, KNOWING fans were begging for it. It wouldn't have taken that much more time, and sales would have been through the roof. Now, even I'm going to have to rent it before I make my decision as to it's worthiness.
Second, if the extra scenes contain any Jar-Jar , you'll be able to see the sales bar drop ...
Third, I'd pay more for Episodes 4,5&6 with just the deleted scenes we already know about than Epi 1. That's how much better these films are; even the lice-ridden Ewoks are more tolerable than most of the creatures from Anikins childhood.
Lastly, it's about ego. I don't feel like rewarding someone with my hard-earned money for having ""artistic sensibilities"" that deny me what I want. Movies are made for the public.

663952,4,6303454038,"The most anticipated movie of all time is a substantial slogan a movie should hold, Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace unfortunately had to suffer the consequenced of this title. Lets face it people, the movie aint THAT bad. Sure Jar Jar should have been sliced and diced in his first 10 seconds of his screen time and Jake Lloyd's ""Yipee's"" do get annoying but the adventure, atmosphere and sheer fun of all the Star Wars movies is evident The Phantom Menace. I Refuse to beleive that not one veiwer smirked at how bizarr, quirky and downright hypnotic this film was.
What I think that people don't realise is The Phantom Menace is the film that it started to intended to be. Their were meant to be alot of special effects because this is a special effects movie!!!! Some movies don't have ANY special effects, but this movie had crap loads, is that SO hard to expect?
I must admit, I did go into this movie, 14 years of age, expecting it to be the best movie of my dreams, of course it wasn't and I don't think any other movie could fill those heafty expectations of anyone.
Another joy of The Phantom Menace is to see the brilliant range of amazingly talented actors that are in the movie: Liam Neeson, Ewan Mc Gregor, Pernilla August, Terence Stamp and Natalie Portman are all cult hit actors in their own right, and just because they chose a project that was a bit more big budgeted than the rest of the films they have done, there is no reason to ridicule them for it, they are in it for the fun of it, just as YOU should be.
So when you sit back and relax and watch The Phantom Menace,throw your brain out the window, and enjoy one of the most amazing technical and inspirational piece of cinema ever.",993427200,,1712,4.386792452830188

This was a time of peace in the universe and corruption in the Senate, and this movie lays the ground work perfectly.

664027,5,6303454038,"I know this is an unpopular view - but I thought Phantom Menace was well done. Granted, the creatures (like Jar-Jar) got annoying. But when people say that, I wonder what they thought of the Catina scene in Episode IV, or the Ewoks in Episode VI, or Jabba's palace, also in Episode VI, or perhaps the Jawas in Episode IV. To me the cute and cuddly Ewoks taking on the Empire was less believable than the Gungans in Phantom Menace.
The story in Episode I was much more fleshed out. I love the original trilogy, but the dialogue is severely lacking in many places. (Witness the scene between Leia and Han in the Ewok village discussing her alleged feelings for Luke in Episode VI for just one example.) All of the movies are very cliched in many respects: there are a lot of dystopian viewpoints in it as well as Messianic overtones and even some Arthurian/Templar type mythology. And that is what Star Wars is: a recasting of many of our major myths in a science-fictional format. It still astounds me the people who fail to realize this and treat it as such.
I thought this movie did a good job of showing the initial formation of the Empire via the machinations of Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious. No movie is going to be perfect (especially when matched up against people's expectations; even though they rarely know what their expectations were) but I think Episode I was a worthy addition to the Star Wars mythos.
I take heart, however. Star Wars Episode IV gathered pretty bad initial reviews as well when it came out in 1977. It took people a little while to come around. Perhaps the same will occur with Episode I.
I have also seen a lot of specific complaints about the movie:
""Anakin not being dark enough."" That would miss the point. The point is: he is the balance. This goes back to the mythology aspects of Star Wars, and is reminiscent of the idea of the seventh son. What this means is that Anakin is one of those that can be swayed to good or evil.
""The midichlorians."" What is wrong with that? Star Wars was a little too much like mysticism with the Force originally. I like the idea of this being a pervasive force throughout the universe (like a Higgs field in our own universe) that can be channeled by people. This should have a ready place in the hearts of New Agers or those who believe in the ability of people to channel energy around them. I am not one of those people - but at least I like this attempt to explain how some people can utilize the Force and others cannot.
""Technology is better."" Well, visually the movie looks better! Does that mean the technology shown in the movie is better? Are there some detailed specs that are floating around for each ship and that someone has done a massive comparison of? I doubt it. The droids were basically droids. The ships were quite obviously precursor designs in various cases to X-Wings and Tie-Fighters. This movie only took place 32 years prior to the events in A New Hope. Thus we would expect improvements but not necessarily massive change considering that during that time the Empire was in power and thus, much like the Roman Church in our history, clamped down on technology. And that is what we see: from the relatively simple ships, we later see Death Stars, Star Destroyers, and Mon Calamari carrier craft.
""Jar-Jar."" Okay, to some degree he might have been annoying. On the other hand, how different was he from Wicket (one of the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi)? I agree he was a little bit corny but, then again, Lucas probably wants to appeal to younger and older audiences - always a delicate balancing act. In fact, Jar-Jar was sort of the Wicket of this movie - he introduced the Jedi's to the Gungans (much as Wicket introduced the Rebels to the Ewoks).
Also consider that this movie followed the theme of Return of the Jedi, particularly near the end. We had three battles going on: the space battle, the ground battle, and the light-saber duel. Think about Return of the Jedi and you will see that the same thematic ideas were used. Both movies showed a relatively inferior race (the Gungans and Ewoks) coming under the control of an ostensibly more powerful force and then, in the end, winning out. I bring this up because I have seen many people who claim they liked (or even loved!) Return of the Jedi say they hated this movie.",993340800,14,4326,4.5403329065300895
664028,5,6303454038,"Many people hated this prequel. I can understand why they would. After all, when something like Star Wars has an almost religious following anything less than a religious experience would be disappointing. What these disappointed people should do, however, is watch the original trilogy and see how many goofy and annoying things they can find in it... seriously. Everybody hails the original Star Wars as a godsend but let's face it, Princess Leia was a whiny brat, Mark Hamille couldn't act his way out of a paper bag, and the lightsaber duel between Vader and Obi-Wan was far from exciting. Even the dialogue was less than great; ""But I was gonna go to town to get some power converters!!!"" <<whine>>. Or how about the fact that Luke finds his aunt and uncle (the people who raised him) both charred to a crisp and then basically goes; ""Oh well... I guess I'll be going to Mos Eisley with you after all..."" But God forbid should anyone find fault with the original, because after 20 years it has become like the Bible of sci-fi, because that is the way as children we REMEMBER it. As children, we could care less about acting, special effects or dialogue. What really mattered is all the cool stuff... how Star Wars made us feel... that we had been transported to another WORLD full of new creatures and technology, a world so remarkably detailed and complex that it seemed real. NOBODY but Lucas has EVER been able to create that feeling of otherworldliness. Every sci-fi movie since seems to me like a director/producer just trying to make a little world for a little 2-hour film, but Star Wars is much more, it gives us a glimpse, a magic window into a very real, living world that you can believe continues to thrive long after your window has closed and the credits roll. With the beautiful landscapes of Naboo, Coruscant and Tatooine, with the miasma of aliens and vehicles, who needs to see more? If you want good acting, watch the Godfather... or better yet, watch CNN and stay in good ol' boring (but realistic) Earth.",993340800,37,2030,4.673184357541899

Why was the technology better? Well lets look at the ancient civilisations like the Myans and the Egyptians and then look at where they are now ... Civilisations fall, looks like that could be what's about to happen in the Star Wars universe does it not?
The whole Metaclorin thing ... Makes perfect sense, the civilsation fell and when old techology was found no-one knew how it worked ... it became ""magic"". No doubt in the years after Jedi this sort of knowledge could be recovered.

664032,3,6303454038,"When I saw this movie in theater, I was astonished.  20 years had been erased from my past.  It was the early 80's again.  I was reduced to a gawk-jawed wide-eyed 5 years old.
The second time I saw this movie I drew the following conclusions:
(For the most part) Good/Great actors performing poorly. Amazing Special Effects with which the actors/extras did not know how to interact (you could tell in many background scenes that the actors did not really know what was going on around them, and did not know how to act with imaginary machines/monsters)
Underrated story with some gaping holes (I had to watch it twice to understand exactly what was going on and what Palpatine's design really was (he reminded me of Dudly Smith from LA Confidential.)
Great action sequences.  But as great as they were, they could have all been improved by multiple rewrites (preferrably by L. Kasdan and not George Lucas.  Retire the writing table George, retire the directing chair, your vision is great, but your skills are lacking.)
Overall, worth watching once, not worth buying on video/DVD The DVD doesn't even have a commentary  which it desperately needs.  Lucas needs to explain himself (if that is possible) to his legion of ex-fanatics turned fanatical critics.
(PS: Jake Lloyd was miscast.  I didn't hate him, but he was too young/inexperienced to play such an uncontemporary role.  Interacting with things that he cannot see took it's tole on his performance.  I was expecting to hate Jar-Jar, in his first scene I was uneasy about him, but as the film progressed, to my own astonishment, he grew on me.  By the final droid battle, I was laughing aloud to his bumblings.  He was corny, but so are Ewoks.  Jar-Jar (his horrible name aside) took the bulk of the corniness upon himself.  In any Lucas movie there's bound to be corny humor.  I'd rather it be Jar Jar who expresses it than Liam Neeson.  This movie is drawn out and very light-hearted.  People did not like this.  They forget it is just the introduction to the series.  An ideally contrasting setup to the upcoming, dark brooding sequels.)",993254400,,2097,4.775

Despite the lack of special effects that we now come to expect these days, you seriously can't tell they were filmed in the late 70s early 80s. And you never feel like you are watching an ""old"" movie. The trilogy has the same magic as Stanley Kubrick's ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"" in that it remains timeless and it hasn't been saturated by Hollywood culture.
The coming of episode one brought with it a sense of the 90s that will probably make you uneasy the first time you watch it, especially since most of the creatures were 3D animated. I nolonger felt like I was meeting new civilizations as most everyone spoke English. And the use of Jar-Jar for comic relief made me cringe. I found it very hard to take a liking to any of the characters at the beginning, especially as they were put into danger soon after the opening title. I honestly didn't care if they made it to the next scene.
All-in-all it's a good movie and will keep you interested. The whole film is completely bright and colorful, which makes it a perfect candidate as a good DVD. The more times you watch it, the more desensitized you'll become to it's underlying tone and you'll enjoy it a lot more as a whole.

664107,3,6303454038,"The Phantom Menace is arguably one of the most anticipated films in motion picture history. So it stands to reason that George Lucas and company would have a hard time delivering on the expectations of his own Empire, which has grown more than two decades old and accumulated hundreds of millions of fans.
It also makes plain Lucas' dilemma: who IS his audience? Is it a massive army of twenty and thirty-somethings old enough to have seen the original trilogy when it was released in theatres in the late 70's and early 80's? Or is it the post Barney set, fresh from their last trip to the video store where they rented that dusty old space movie Dad kept talking about?
If he makes the Teletubby version of his obsessively awaited prequel, he attracts children...AND their parents, who will then be forced to run to Toys R' us after the show to buy little Billy or little Sue the Jar Jar doll with the retractible tongue.
It's the practical side of me that forgives Lucas this decision. Moviemaking is, in the end, about profit. It is business, and butts in seats equals money. Anything short of that is labeled a nonsuccess. Don't believe me? I could list for you a litany of critically acclaimed films that could have had a sequel if not for the fact that they had little audience. The opposite is true for awful movies that attract massive audiences. Witness Dumb and Dumber. Was there anything there that warranted a sequel? I think not. So my practical side understands.
It's the artist and wide-eyed child in me that's disappointed. Lucas has delivered so many moments of pure fluff, you'll think it's harvest time at Eli Whitney's place. Jar Jar Binks, a malconceived comic relief in a story that never explores its serious side enough to warrant one, is so distracting you'll find yourself putting your attention on pause until the screen relieves itself of his malodorous presence. He's interesting for the first few seconds, because overall the graphic work is pretty amazing, but after that I wanted to dig out my own eyeballs with a garden weasel.
Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, fine actors who generally raise the bar of any production they take part in, seem uncomfortable and out of place. Their lines are stilted, probably the result of a hideous script that never finds a unifying tone. One minute, it's all darkness and fear, the next we're suffering a farting pack animal. No, I'm serious. A FARTING PACK ANIMAL. And in case Dolby surround 5.1 isn't good enough to get the point across, we then have to watch the CG Jar Jar hold his nose and make cartoon faces in response. Thanks, George. I wasn't sure the animal had ACTUALLY farted. I thought maybe a subwoofer blew out.
One of the bigger insults to Star Wars fans will be something called ""Metachlorians,"" which apparently are the source of The Force. They are some sort of tiny symbiont, or maybe they're a chloride group. It would explain my tendency to want to doze throughtout the flick. In any case reducing The Force, which most of us had accepted as religion, to a biological event is not just disappointing, it obliterates any trace of mystery Lucas had built over the course of the three previous films.
All this said, the film has some bright spots. The vast majority of the special effects (which soak each and every frame, this is truly a filmmaking milestone) are stunning. Nothing even close to this level of reality has ever been attempted, much less accomplished. The few that are less than stellar probably wouldn't be noticed if it weren't for the high quality of the remainder.
Sound, sound editing, music, set design and costumes far exceed any other movie released in '99, including The Matrix, despite its awards.
And buried beneath a mile or so of marshmallow, goosedown and foam rubber is a core story that is quite complex and very clever. We know what the future is, and Lucas uses that to drop what are sometimes very subtle hints about why the characters we grew up with are the way they are.
Which is why you need to watch the film three or more times. If you see it only once, you've missed alot that went on while you were trying to settle back into the story after a Jar Jar appearance. By the third viewing, you'll be able to tune him out, and the movie rises up a level.
Overall, Menace could have been a MUCH better film, but isn't as bad as what you might have been led to believe. I understand someone re-edited it to eliminate most of Jar Jar and other extraneous kiddie fluff and it made it a truly great film. Maybe Lucas will get the hint and deliver a more Star Wars like prequel when Episode II arrives in 2002.",993081600,27,4629,4.605326876513317

But when Episode I: The Phantom Menace came into theaters, then onto VHS the DVD format was available for quite some time, and according to the digital video revolution, the picture, sound, and details were outstanding. But why did George decide to release Episode I now. What was his reason for not doing it when it came out. I was at Winamp.com recently and there was a comment about Episode I not being on DVD at the time. But that's a good question. But with the DVD release on Oct. 16, 2001, there will be deleted scenes, tons of extras and commentary, possibly on what the story or ideas where when he began writing Episode II. And since Lucas Ltd, only has a little over a year before the second film is released why not reveal what the next title will be to the public. But I have to say one thing DVD rocks!

But sadly within 10 minutes into the film I was horribly saddened to see that Lucas has turned this film into a childrens movie. Something that should be seen on Disney. Horrible characters, just plain horrible. Ruined the film completely. Jar-Jar Binks was the worst. Just to hear the name sends me into a state of depression. I sure hope for his next film he rethinks how he is going to display his characters. There was no sence of deepness to this film. A five year old child could tell me what everything meant and what the end result would be. Bad. Bad. Bad. I would have rated this film zero stars but I must admit the effects were rather nice.

664178,5,6303454038,"First of all, if you go into this movie expecting it to change the world like the original Star Wars, you will bee disappointed.  It is absolutely impossible for history to repeat itself in that sense because 1) Star Wars had the very important element of surprise in 1977 and 2) movies like this just weren't being made back then.  With Episode 1, George Lucas took on the almost impossible task of adding to an American icon.  One magazine article published before the May 1999 premiere (I don't remember which magazine) said it was comparable to redesigning the American flag or giving Mickey Mouse a brother.  Keeping this in mind, Episode 1 holds up extremely well.  It maintains the Star Wars 'feel' throughout, and the podrace and final battle sequences had my pulse racing.  The main area of criticism is the younger appeal this film seems to have when compared to the original trilogy.  This is nonsense to me, the Star Wars saga has always been for kids and like all good childrens' movies it offers a much needed break for adults tired of all the cinicism, and meaningless violence in films today.  Of course, the other sore spot for many people is Jar Jar Binks.  Honestly, I liked him.  He offered a refreshing contrast to the stoic, respectful Jedi.  I can understand why some people can't abide his silliness, but that all comes down to opinions, and you know what they say about those.  When all is said and done, Episode 1 is a worthy movie and a good starting point for the Star Wars saga.  However, don't forget, it's only a movie; lighten up and enjoy it.",992995200,2,1575,4.602150537634409
664179,1,6303454038,"THis film is only so-so and does not live up to the hype.  It is a pale shadow of the incredible original star wars trilogy.  This one was obviously made jsut for the kids.  It has the look and feel of a Disney film rather than a Lucas movie.  It also has the storyline and character development that one would expect from a 1980's Saturday morning cartoon.  Waaaay to much screen time is devoted to the bumbbling antics of goofy Jar Jar Binks that only the 5 and under crowd can appreciate.  Also, Anakin's acting is horrible and there are many sloooow parts where he talks to Padme or his mother which require ready access to the fast forward on your remote.  The villians, who are most interesting get very little screen time which is disapointing in and of itself, but also leaves the viewer to wonder at the end of the film: Why did they villians do all these terrible things?  The films only apparaent answer is that they are the bad guys and the good guys need bad guys to fight.  There was not much to explain the plot or tell why the characters were acting as they were.  I've heard many fans say that this is just a set-up for E2 and E3.  Still, this film should be able to stand on its own.  If The original 1977 Star Wars film was this weak and blamed it on ""setting up for ESB and ROTJ"" the star wars franchise would have been dead right then and there.  Still TPM has some redeeming qualitites.  Liam Neeson is good.  There is a very visually exciting pod race, and the lightsabre battle at the end is pretty cool (and unfortunatly its really the only time you ever get to see more than a few teaser seconds of Darth Maul, who could have been cool if they utilized him more than for just the final battle.  Hopefully the extra scenes in the DVD version will help eplain a lot of the unanswered questions and premises on which the film is based so that it will make sense.",992995200,,1885,4.267605633802817
664180,5,6303454038,"Okay, let me start off my saying that yes STAR WARS: EPISODE 1: THE PHANTOM MENACE is not the BEST SW movie ever to grace the screen. It has its flaws, yet then again so did the originals. As Randall on ""Clerks: The Animated Series"" pointed out how the hell do lightsabers know where to stop? But that's off the topic. The reason SW:TPM works well as the starting off point for the greatest cienmatic saga of all time lies in its ability to explain how everyone came together. In this film you learn how Anakin and Padme met. How Obi-wan became Anakin's master. How Palpatine began his rise to power, and how everything was his doing through the film.  True there are some flaws in the fact that Obi-wan is trained by Qui-Gon, instead of Yoda and Anakin was supposedly a great pilot when Obi-Wan met him yet in the film he's just a boy. BUT Obi-wan is still under the guidance of Yoda, and Anakin is the only human that s good enough to PILOT a pod-racer. What TPM does it basically tell the viewers that it was here that everyone met, that this is how the entire saga's ""cogs"" were set into motion. And for the eagle-eyed fan, you'll notice that everything was planned by Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious. That the events of the film were all meant to bring about his rise to power. Now with the DVD. A moment to drool.... Oh yeah! Anyways, with the DVD's inclusion of the seven deleted scenes, which are wonderfully completed with full visual effects; storyboard to animatics to finished film; the ""Beginning"" documentary; audio commentary with George Lucas, Rick McCallum, Ben Burtt, Scott Squires, John Knoll, Dennis Muren and Rob Coleman; Five behind the scene featurettes; the music video; the twelve part ""lynne's diary""; a gallery of poster and the like; and all the trailers, from tv to theater. this 2 disc DVD set is, well Drool-tastic.

THAT'S IT. There are just too many things wrong with this movie. For starters, why have they made ""The Force"" out to be something of a scientific nature? I liked the mystical and mysterious quality about ""The Force"" that was abundant in ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Why was this movie aimed for children? All of the original Star Wars fans, like me, are in our twenties and thirties by now. I understood that Lucas was trying to get a new generation of Star Wars fans, but c'mon. This movie could be shown on The Disney Channel without editing a thing! Why, oh why didn't we see more of Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and Yoda? I wanted to see Mace whup somebody real bad with his lightsaber. I don't know about anyone else, but the true ""money shot"" would have been to see Yoda wielding a lightsaber and shoving it up a robot's ""you know what"". Why were Jedis only slicing at robots throughout the whole movie anyways? The only other battle is the one with Darth Maul.  And what about the mysterious character known as Darth Maul? I realize that he's not a real talker, but they could have given a bit more background story on him. I admit, he was definitely interesting though. He was the best character in the movie and what did Lucas do? He kills him off. Why Lucas? WHY? He was an excellent menace to star in your next installment. Because of the heavy make-up, he could have been played by anyone with kung fu skills in Episode 2. Also, the movie dragged, BIGTIME thanks to its never-ending babble about politics in this Star Wars world. Lucas, I understand that you had to establish your plot, but about 30 minutes of the movie could have been cut if you hadn't gone ON AND ON about the ""Trade Federation"" and ""Naboo"" and all this other crap. All of that stuff could have been canned and it would have made room for the ideas listed above! These are only SOME of the things that were wrong with this movie. I could've gone on, but you get the point. Watch this once just to see the three things listed at the beginning. E-mail me if you have any comments for me. The original Trilogy still rules!

When you compare Liam Neeson's role in ""Rob Roy"" to this disaster, you can see it Liams eyes, he appeared almost embarassed to be there. I was at first miffed that this was not released on DVD.

Okay, this movie was basically awesome. The special effects were top-notch and the action sequences were incredible. However, I would have hoped for the acting to be a little better, but you really can't complain given everything else the movie has to offer. After all, Star Wars isn't exactly about acting, and the acting in the originals was nothing to write home about.
The Podrace scene was just a blast, and the lightsaber battles were edge-of-your seat excitement.
There is lots of subtle symbolism and metaphors in the movie that can be easily overlooked by many people. You have look deeper to understand the full meaning of the themes going on throughout the film.
I know that alot of people don't like Jar Jar, but I'm pretty much crazy about him (as you can see from the opening paragraph). There is really no reason to hate Jar Jar - he is just an innocent caught up in an adventure. He can't help that his voice sounds different and that he is clumsy. The world wouldn't be a very nice place if everyone hated someone based upon such things.

664289,3,6303454038,"Well, there are over 1200 reviews of this movie.  Most of the reviews are from the fans themselves.  And seemingly, the fans are more critical of this movie than a viewer who has little experience with the original 3 Star Wars movies.  However, I think most of us may agree with some basics of the movie.  The special effects were well worth the viewing, however, they were a little overdone.  I need to agree with most of the reviews about the character Jar Jar.  If there was anything annoying about this film, it was this character.  For the first 15 minutes of the film, Jar Jar was bearable.  However, for the rest of the film, I found it difficult not to want to walk out of the movie!  My first impressions for the reason why Lucas chose to have a bumbling, annoying character in the film, distracting the viewers, was for the mere commercialism.  Perhaps he hoped to use Jar Jar's ""comedy"" as an attraction that little children might enjoy.  And thus, use Jar Jar as an attraction for children to want to buy Jar Jar dolls and other Star Wars paraphernalia.  Kinda odd (that while I was walking through ToysRUS) that the only toys remaining in all the hype over Star Wars toys, was the Jar Jar doll! As an end all, I feel this movie is a good story teller, and entertaining.  The acting and costumes were above average.  As a viewer, you might be a little annoyed at times, however, this is a good family film to sit down to with some popcorn.
As A Star Wars fan myself (of the original 3),  I found it hard not to be dissapointed with this film.  But rightly so!!  Every fan probably has some dissapointments.  We're all hopeing to relive our past somehow.  We were all hoping that Lucas would bring the dream back.  What we should have realized, is that there will never be another ""Star Wars"" such as the one in the 70's, that left the world bedazzled with something new! I only hope the series take a more ""Serious"" approach in the upcoming 2 films...  The last thing I want to see in the battle between good vs. evil (in episode 3) is a stupid Jar Jar binks running around in the middle of it all!!! Hey Lucas!!

664290,2,6303454038,"OK --- let's see how many 'Star Wars' fans I can upset here. I thought the whole thing was a waste of effort, time and money. I enjoyed the original 'Star Wars' - it was fun to watch, good entertainment. But this was just dire. The lead actors (McGregor, Neeson et al) were completely wasted in a script as flat as cardboard. The SFX were impressive at times, but even that failed to save a film that I would consider a chore to rewatch. There is nothing of the liveliness and gung-ho sense of adventure of the original. The whole thing is lacking in excitement and good humour. Spend your hard-earned dollars on something else.",989539200,6,628,4.469565217391304
664330,2,6303454038,"The next two episodes which complete the Star Wars saga will have to be a huge improvement on this installment, if only to save the great name of Star Wars. From the word 'go' the potentially likeable team of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are battling against the forces of the dark side, the robots of the trade federation, and a decidedly dodgy script. The cheesy performance of the young Anakin Skywalker certainly doesn't help matters, and the sound and visual effects just don't seem to have the same positive influence on the film as the originals did. What did help the film's cause were the superbly convincing performance of young Natalie Portman, the Queen of Naboo, and the interesting and exciting character of Darth Maul, the original villain. However, as all of these new ideas, characters and plots enter the fray. e.g The trade federation, Naboo, the Sith and blood tests to check how strong you are with the force. You could be left asking yourself ""What has this got to do with the Star Wars story?"" You could quite easily walk out of the theatre wondering what it was all about!",989366400,,1097,4.689119170984456
664331,2,6303454038,"For the love of God couldn't they have just left it alone? The first 3 were perfect. But now Star Wars will be forever tarnished. Episode One was easily the biggest gimmick in the history of movie making; the biggest let down of all time. I remember sitting in the theater and praying for Luke, Han, Leia, Lando, Vader, or Chewy to pop-up on the screen and save this thing. But that didn't happen. Instead I found myself slouching in the seat and feeling stupid for wasting so much time waiting in line. Now on to the movie itself:
I felt sorry for Liam Neeson, what a pity to waste such great talent. Ewen McGregor was good also, probably just him and Neeson, unfortunately their acting wasn't enough to save such a poorly written script. All the rest of the cast were mediocre. (I'll get to The Kid later...)
The special effects were... uh, stupid. Special effects aren't supposed to be characters. It was like watching a puppet show or something. I dont' know how George is gonna remedy this problem in the next movie-- it seems he's dug quite a large hole for himself. Plus he's also stuck with some of the same dumb actors, i.e. Natalie Portman. What was Jar Jar's purpose? He was fine for about 10 seconds. I think as a rule they should've limited the dialogue between real people and animated characters to no more than 10 seconds.
Finally, Anakin. The golden rule in hollywood: never use child actors (except the kid from The 6th Sense and the girl from Excorcist).
Okay, I'm done wasting anymore time on this movie.",988848000,6,1524,4.545454545454546
664332,4,6303454038,"Don't get me wrong.  I loved this movie - I saw it five times in the theaters.  But the one thing that really bothered me was the character of Jar Jar.  I realize the movie was intended for a younger audience than has become Star Wars' following...but Jar Jar was too much with his silly pig latin talk and just plain stupidity.  I didn't think he added to the plot at all.
What I was very impressed with was the end, how there were so many things going on at once (three? four? different large events) and they were all followable and linked and made sense.  I also thought the casting was fantastic.  Ewan McGregor made a totally believeable young Obi-Wan, and while we obviously had never met an older Qui-Gonn Jinn, Liam Neeson was wonderful in the role he played.  And little Jake Lloyd had the perfect look for Anakin; young, innocent, charming, but with a quiet intelligence and intensity that spoke volumes of his abilities.
Did anyone else find the explanation for the Metichlorians (sp) to be rather trivial and silly?  I really didn't like it at all. I'd tend to think of the Force as being something metaphysical - not something you can quantify by taking a blood sample.  That and Jar Jar were my main complaints.  Other than that, what a FANTASTIC movie!  Have four years passed yet????",988243200,4,1300,4.560344827586207
664333,1,6303454038,"The proper use of Special Effects is to enhance a film, not to outshine the actors, characters, or story. Sadly, Lucas spent too much time on his visual 'sumptuous feast', rather than developing characters, and especially their interaction with each other.
The premise itself offered no real prelude to the famous trilogy, where it should have been exploring the origins of the Force, the Dark Side and the Jedi Council, then leading into the action sequences. At least Terry Brooks got that bit correct in the book, when he explained the significance of a Master and an Apprentice (there are only ever two), and the history of the Dark Side.
Jar Jar Binks is almost completely superfluous to the plot (almost, because he does serve the role of Guide), and is essentially there as a marketing gimmick for children; just listen to his dialogue! - ""Exsqueeeze me!""
What made the original trilogy brilliant was that the story was character driven. Han was a scroundel, Luke was a naive youth coming of age, Leia was a feisty girl and so on. These characters had depth, whereas no-one in Episode One did.
The imagination and story-telling skills behind the first triology were clever and artistic. It is clear Lucas has the talent and skill to make brilliant movies based around strong, well-developed characters and stories. Unfortunately, with Ep. 1, he seemed more concerned about producing a marketing giant. He knew people would flock to the movie because it was Star Wars and so did not need to entice people to the cinema wih strong characters and interesting storylines.
I hope that with Episode II Lucas goes back to more traditional story telling methods, ie., characterisation, dramatisation, plot line developments, in order to tell a great tale. The potential is there for a great new trilogy - the tale of a boy strong with the Force succombing to the powers of the Dark Side is a tragic scenario and should be dealt as one - not some flamboyant expression of digital technology mimicking artwork.",988070400,54,2007,4.8885630498533725
664334,3,6303454038,"This movie is surrounded in controversy.  Some hate it and some like it whilst others seem to like it but have problems here and there.  I fall in the latter category.  I like this film but I had a few problems with it.
Before I continue with the review of the film I will just mention a bit about the transfer.  The widescreen image that we get on the video is THX certified and is one of the most impressive widescreen tapes I have.  Colours just jump from the screen.  The sound is also reasonably good.  Just turn it up really loud and you will know what I mean.
Firstly the positives.  The lightsaber battles, the pod race, and the droid fights were extremely impressive.  The large space battle towards the end was very impressive.  Well done Industrial Light and Magic you guys have produced quite impressive pieces of eye candy.  The story was relatively simple and easy to follow as well.  Jar Jar did not annoy me, he provided some well timed comic relief for the kids as well as few instances for the adults.  Lastly Ian McDiarmid has the best performance in this film in my opinion.
The problems however were concerned mainly around the actors.  Jake Llyod was awkward with his deliveries.  I expected so much from Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor, that their performances seemed dry.  Apart from the acting and a relatively slow middle (on Tatooine) it was an impressive Star Wars film.
By the way the only thing preventing this from getting 4 stars is the fact that this would look so much better on DVD in anamorphic widescreen and full 5.1 surround.  VHS just isn't that impressive in its presentation anymore.",987897600,5,1640,4.6
664335,2,6303454038,"As hard as I try I still have issues with this film. I have eagerly awaited this film since George Lucas first anounced his plan for the Star Wars saga way back in 1977. I was 17 at the time and still in high school. I am now 41 years old and none of the films that I have seen to date can compare to seeing the original Star Wars films at the Lowes Astor Plaza on Broadway here in New York for the first,or 21st time. Needless to say, The Phantom Menace is not the film that I waited 20+ years to see. Although I enjoyed the film in the theatre it did not hold up to repeated viewings.  In all fairness I must say that the film is a technical masterpiece. Yes ILM did break new ground with the computer graphics. Yes the film is beautiful to watch. George Lucas however,somehow,somewhere,seemed to forget that special effects do not make the film. All the razzle dazzle in the world is useless if the characters; who are supposed to be the driving force of the film are not fully realized,and badly acted. It is evident that Mr. Lucas was so engrossed in the special effects aspect of the film that he paid little or no attention to script and characters. I found the acting to be flat and emotionless. Qui-Gon and Obi-wan walk through much of the film in a coma. I felt nothing for these characters whatsoever,considering the acting credentials of these two performers. Jar Jar binks is one of the most unlikeable characters I have ever seen on film. Being an african american I cannot help but notice the racial stereotype used for Jar Jar, although George has denied it. Natalie Portman turned in a good performance as Queen Amidala but I found it difficult at times to know who was the real queen and who was the decoy through all that heavy makeup. In regards to little Anakin it was evident that Mr. Lucas cast this child for his looks and not for any real acting talent. I understand that the purpose of the film was to establish the background of the new characters but I still feel that the film suffers greatly because of a lack of a central villan. The one great character created by Lucas in years was Darth Maul. We needed to see more of this guy. I was greatly disappointed that the character recieved so little screen time, not enough dialog, and a serious upstaging by Obi-wan. The character deserved better. Compared to the other films, The Phantom Menace goes to the end of the line behind The Return Of The Jedi; my least favorite of the Star Wars films until now. I think that George Lucas needs to return to basics. Maybe he should invite Steven Speilberg, and James Cameron over for lunch and take notes. All things aside it still is Star Wars and well worth seeing. I am looking forward to seeing how the characters develop in the second film.

664336,5,6303454038,"Many people may have disliked THE PHANTOM MENACE because it was not made in the 70s or 80s and it didn't have Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, or Princess Lia. Well, duh...they weren't even born yet in this episode! And Darth Vader didn't exist, either. But this movie is just as excellent as the last three...just different.
I think everybody has seen THE PHANTOM MENACE and knows what it's about so I don't really have to write a summary. But in THE PHANTOM MENACE, there are some interesting and new characters such as the young future-to-be Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), JarJar Binks, Anakin's mother Shmi Skywalker (Pernilla August), Qui-Gonn Jonn (Liam Neeson), Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman), and Darth Maul (Ray Park), along with many other new characters.
THE PHANTOM MENACE was aiming more toward Anakin Skywalker's point of view. The special effects and sound effects are incredible. The storyline is pretty good, too. Even though this movie is very long, it is a very good long movie that will have you engrossed until the end. This isn't just for STAR WARS fans - though I do say I am a STAR WARS fan - this movie can be for anybody. Of course, it would be better to watch the other episodes so you know what's supposed to be happening and you are not totally clueless about everything.
George Lucas did an amazing job with THE PHANTOM MENACE and I congratulate him on a job-well-done. It is a satisfying movie with excellent and surpurb acting from the entire cast essemble. It is a definite must see and must own for all STAR WARS fans and a great movie for just about anyone to see. Go and see this movie and I can guarentee you'll love it.

664338,3,6303454038,"I've always been a huge ""Star Wars"" fan, infact, after nearly 20 years the original film is still my favorite movie of all time. Even its two successors ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"", although not as good as the original, are very well made and enjoyable movies themselves.
Naturally, as with all the other fans of the series world wide, I couldn't wait to go see ""Episode I"" when it was finally released in the summer of '99.  I went into the theater expecting to see something magical, something completely wonderful that would allow me, for two and a half hours, to relive my past childhood experiences of having seen the original film and ""ROTJ"" in the theaters.  However, as I walked out of the theater, with the end credits rolling up on the screen behind me, I realized that I had allowed myself to get my hopes up only to have them come crashing back down around me.
""Episode I"" (properly titled ""The Phantom Menace"") is not really a bad movie, but it does lack a lot of the things that made the earlier three films so special.
#1 The story itself is just not as good.  Granted this is the ""beginning"" of the entire saga, and the story is not really awful, it just lacks a lot of the warmth and freshness that made the first three films so original and different from all other motion pictures.
#2 The CGI effects are the real stars of this movie, and therefore only manage to over shadow the true elements of the film, the human actors.  Don't get me wrong, I don't really hate the whole CGI thing in movies, but I will always believe that the old Harryhausen style of making film creatures and using real life props, costumes and settings will always be the better way to go in making motion pictures.  To me, using ""real"" substances to make film effects and filming in ""real"" locations just make a movie seem more believable.  Personally, I think that the whole use of CGIs only helped to ""kill"" the motion picture industry in the '90s.  Sure it was nice to see old characters again, like Jabba, but I felt as though I were only watching cartoon drawings of them instead of actual ""flesh and blood"" representations.  Granted the Special Edition releases of the original three films had new CGI scenes and characters added to them, but the films were basically the same as they had always been, just fine tuned a little.
#3 I didn't really find myself being able to care about the characters as I had in the original trilogy.  Even Yoda seemed kind of like a stranger to me in this one.  And don't even get me started on Jar Jar Binks, a tragic attempt to create a character to help fill the void left by the missing Chewbacca.  The only character who does have the same old ""feel"" to him is R2-D2.  The film would've been better had C-3PO figured more prominently in the story line, considering his time spent on screen was maybe 5 minutes max.  Hopefully (surely) we'll be seeing more of him in episodes 2 and 3.
#4 The acting, particularly that done by the kid who played Anakin and the chick who played Queen Amidala/Padmee, was extremely card board and at times nearly unbearable.  Granted, when Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford were cast in the original film they were pretty much amateurs when it came to acting, but they were able to do an excellent job anyway.
finally,
#5 The musical score composed by John Williams, who is truly an artist of his field, although not bad, does tend to sometimes lack the magical quality of the music he had written for the original trilogy.  And many of the major themes (some understandably not appearing in this film) are not even present in the film.  Even the Main Title is only heard a total of about 3 times during the movie.
With all that having been said, and I know I've been a little harsh, one should not dismiss this movie as a meer imposter and not see it.  For what it is, ""The Phantom Menace"" is not a bad movie, it just fails in its attempt to live up to the reputation of its three predecessors.  Let's face it though, will any movie ever be able to compare to the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy.  Considering the mostly dismal state of the motion picture industry today, I'd have to say that the possibility of that happening is highly unlikely.
Good luck George, and may the Force be with you.",987120000,2,4296,4.46360153256705

TELL ME...IS IT GEORGE THAT'S THE GREEDY ONE OR IT'S ALL OF YOU WHO LIKE TO CRITICIZE THE GUY THAT GAVE YOU ALL OF THIS!? let's also remeber that george is telling a story here and he's had the phantom menace story in his head since he did the 1st 3 so it's not like he just made it up in 1998 and threw it together! ep. 1 came from the same time period as the other 3 classics and the next two films. ep. 1 is the begining of this whole 6 part saga and like george and many people have said it will be better when you can sit down and watch all six together and i personally think that will be true. i love ep. 1 the same way i love the other 3 because in my mind george can't do any wrong with this saga and will continue to amaze and dazzle the true belivers and fans with the next two films! enjoy what you got because we're lucky that he came back to give us what we wanted!,986947200,3,2769,4.018115942028985

The acting is as good as can be found in any movie, there is not a bad actor in the bunch.  The lightsaber fights are spectacular.  They did well to bring in Ray Parks to coreograph the fights.  The movie manages to keep the kind of light space opera tone, while manageing to upgrade the movie to current standards.
  I don't know if Lucas could have done any better, and I have to respect his descion to change the way the movie is presented.  All things must change, or what's the point of makeing more of them.  What I didn't like was the way that the movie lost the more serious tones of the first trilogy.  Some of the writing just doesn't take itself seriously.  The battle sceanes outside of the lightsaber deuls are just too kiddy.  I missed the way that in the previous movies the particapants seemed to take what they were doing seriously.  To take someone elses words, ""they shot fake looking laserbeams at each other and dodged them like they were real.""  They went to far putting in a pod racing sceane that was there just for a video game, and they overwrote their comedy, and drama, making the movie seem too contrived at times.  But overall this movie is still better than most.  For kids who havn't seen the old Star Wars this will be an exciting introduction to this great world.

664351,3,6303454038,"Some fans had been waiting over twenty years to see the first installment of the Star Wars series.  They wanted to see how these stories all started.  They had seen episodes four, five and six; they were impressed.  They queued for a chance to see the previews; they were impressed.  They waited impatiently, some slept on the streets, so eager to get a ticket for the Phantom Menace, they saw Episode 1.  They were unimpressed.  How surprising!  Nothing is worse for a film than a mountain of hype built up prior to it.  It will never, ever reach those lofty expectations.
Thankfully my expectations were low.  I enjoyed the first three Star Wars movies but my enjoyment never matured into an obsession.  They were fine, not great.  Science Fiction was never my favourite genre.  But still, I had to see Phantom Menace.  It was the biggest grosser of the Summer, even if it came with unflattering reviews.
Away from the hype, The Phantom Menace isn't bad, not bad at all.  It's not a great film, but neither were the other three, or at least they never aspired to be great movies.  Phantom Menace can surely hold its own when looked at against the other three installments, and as a science fiction film it is most definitely above average.
Plaudits go to the casting directors.  Liam Neeson is noble, Ewen McGregor embodies the iconic Obi-Won with a grace that was expected and Natalie Portman is adept at what is essentially a dual role.  The weaknesses are Jake Lloyd, a child with a touch too much confidence for the role.  Casting a child must be impossible.  How do you balance the cutesy factor from the annoying factor?  They failed.  The other principle player was CGI created and popular opinion suggests Jar Jar was a mistake.  I don't.  He was fun.
Director Lucas keeps the immortal opening title sequence and the equally recognisable wipe cuts.  His direction is fine, it is his writing that fails.  A tax dilemma?  Why such a snoozeworthy plot?  It seems Lucas has fallen in love with his world a little too much.  To be fair though, the action scenes are exciting.  The battle scene is powerful cinema, better than the acclaimed pod-chasing moment.

I personally think that we have way too many  violent and artificial movies out there, that don't deserve half the recognition they get. Some people  say that the acting was bad. Well, if you recall a  little movie that came out in 1977, called Star Wars, only had one good actor, and his name was Alec. We all seem to forget that a Star Wars movie isn't  about acting. It's about taking us to another world. It's about the universal battle of good versus evil. This movie gives us everything we want from a Star Wars movie. Some of it is slow going, but is necesary in order to establish a story-line for the future of this Saga. For those of us who crave action, the  last 30 minutes of this film blew me away. The light- saber duel is the best fight sequence I have ever witnesed. And I have seen thousands of fims in my many years. The intensity and power displayed by Liam Neeson, Ewan McGreggor and Ray Park, is amazing. The job that Natalie Portman does as the Queen is at the very least, perfect. The Visual and Sound effects are the best in any movie before it. The fact that The Matrix won the Oscars  instead, is a travesty. It had nothing to do with how good the Matrix is, it's just that ""Hollywood"" is very anti-Lucas. Personally, I think that this film should have won an oscar for Visual effects, Sound effects, Make-up (just look at how many actors were getting  dressed up as aliens), costumes (it should have won an oscar for Amidala's dresses, alone), and of course the original score. The Original Score done by John Williams, is spectacullar. It's the only Original Score Soundtrack I own.  I find myself humming to some of the music, sometimes. If you're hesitating, don't.

Lucas dashed off a no-hearted effort on this one. It was like an especially weak Sci-Fi Channel production. In fact, it's not even up to those standards. Lucas acts as though neither special effects nor audience tastes have progressed since the late seventies, when Star Wars was somewhat innovative. What a worthless story line. The scorecard of political intrigues certainly wasn't worth following. I can't remember when I've seen a movie with so little character development. The acting was abysmal, with the exception of Liam Neeson. The quiet dignity he brought to his role was very effective, but wasted. His good acting made the terrible acting of everyone else around him look even worse. Lucas was obviously influenced by the wooden acting of the various popular Star Trek series. The kid that played Anakin and the woman who played the queen were especially terrible. The character of Binks had no endearing qualities to him, so I assume he was placed in the movie solely to annoy us. Lucas sleepwalked his way through this one.

I am not a SW fan, actually as far as I am concerned it is nothing but a western set in space.  The only reason I ened up watching the Phatom Menace was due to bordom on a Sunday afternoon during 1999. And what an afternoon it was!  This movie absolutely blew my mind!  Instead of getting a cheesy movie riddled with sensless fighting, one dimensional characters and a  transparent plot. I got a movie with fleshed out characters and a complex plot (it took me 3 viewings to figure out the reason for the  trade war).  Jar Jar Binks was annyoing but everyone compensates for that big time-especially Natalie Portman who I tip my hat  to.  If the acting had not been so strong in this film I would have been on the floor laughing at the diologue.

This was going to be a movie where you went in, and came out and went ""Oh my god, that was the coolest thing I've ever seen.""
That said, the film doesn't do that.  It's supposed to be an epic story, a saga.  A very rich story like it is in the original Star Wars.  It should have been as powerful as those, but with modern effects and an enourmous budget.
Instead, the thing is FULL of corny lines.  Jar Jar Binks is the worst addition to the saga EVER.  He is there only as an appeal to young kids.  It's so blatently obvious that it's embarrasing to watch.  I'm 15, and I've been a Star Wars fan for a long, long time.  I read all the books and really got in to it.  When the next episode finally came out, I was hopeing to see it be amazing.  I wanted to go in and come out with the reaction I said above.  Instead I came out and said, ""Heh, that was kinda dumb.""  Seeing a dumb character step in poo (twice) and say things like exqueeze me is NOT Star Wars.  Nor is watching little kids accidently blow up a ship by accidently flying into it, while saying things like ""Whoa, this is tense!""  That is NOT Star Wars, that's corny and really, really shallow wrighting.
Bottom line, this movie should have been extraordinary.  The fans who waited in line to see this for days didn't come to see Jar Jar or Anakin be dumb and cute.  They came to see Star Wars.  This stuff is really a dissapointment.
But, I gave it three stars because the music is outstanding and the battles and all the effects are increadible.  The Droids vs. the Gungans was really cool, but it's ruined by making Jar Jar (who has no clue what he's doing...how is he a general?  IT MAKES NO SENSE) accidently kill some driods by accidently letting loose the Gungan's bombs.  The Pod race was SUPERBLY done.  The three-way lightsaber battle was EXCEPTIONAL.  This stuff IS star wars.  The Jedi council, the senate and that stuff was good too.  These things manage to save the movie, but not enough.

664384,3,6303454038,"You could go on forever about the short-comings and flaws of the first episode in the Star Wars saga but simply put; this should have been a brilliant movie, it wasn't.  Hype and hysteria aside, the only real expectations this film had to live up to were the ones set by it's extrodinary predessecors; the characters, the engaging story and that elusive gem that simply makes a Star Wars movie what it is.  Yet this film falls short on all of these aspects, except the special effects,  which dazzling as they are, do not make for a great movie.
The spunk and attitude of Han Solo and Princess Leia is sorely missed, in it's place is drolling dialogue from strangely sombre and serious characters who you simply cannot relate to.  Little Anaking Skywalker is just too nice to become Darth Vader, a simple hint of wickedness would have been so rewarding to the viewer all too aware of what is to come.  Queen Amidala had so much potential, the talented Natalie Portman clearly tries to breathe life into flat lines and situations but there's not much hope.  Darth Maul's evil appearance could rival Darth Vader's breathing mask anyday, but the character itself is a waste from start to finnish.  Obi Wan Kenobi has none of the warmth brought to him by Alec Guinness, and Ewan McGreggor tries just too hard at the Englsih accent.
The plot of Star Wars movies have always been simple but here Lucas goes in a different direction of galactic politics and trade disputes, a far cry from the pure simplicity of the ways of the force (midi-chlorians are a blatant example of this)
But at the end of the day, the special effects are breathtaking, from the exhilerating podrace to precision-cut execution of the 3-way lightsaber battle.  The screen gleams and sihines of colour from beginning to end, but it could be Lucas' new found obsession with computer effects that is tarnishing the concept of the film itself.",983836800,2,1907,4.7057057057057055

Anyway, we can lose him in the second. [Should have had him less homnoid-looking; maybe kangaroo-like] I love the way the queen talks.  Same with the Federation yokels.  And I like the kid's mom's accent too.  Uh ..... great special effects.  Without peer.  The sabre battles are perfekt.  That Darth Maul can move.  He must have hired for his background in dance, either that or his double.  Those sabre battles are the best part of the movie.  Except for the music during those sabre battles.  Battle of the Fates.  Unbelievably moving. Beyond words.  Constructive critcism you want?  I liked the old Yoda doll better, but you can edit that when you rerelease it.  Whosever doing his voice doesn't sound at all like Frank Oz.  Jar Jar Binks should be less homonoid and  I must admit I wanted him dead from the moment I saw him.
I didn't see this until March of 2001.  Everyone I talked to said it was a ""kid's movie"".  If you ask me it was only slightly better than Return of the Jedi... which I loathed.

George, please take your time on the next one.  Sand it.  wax it.  Sand it again.  There are very few Mozart's in the world.  Beethoven had to rewrite again and again.  This movie needs some sanding.
To be honest if you made JJB less homonoid looking and not so annoying [and less prevalent], the movie would be vastly improved right there. The kid needs to redo his scenes until it doesn't sound forced.  And the ending.... the kid just isn't REAL if you get my meaning.

The music during the Darth Maul lightsaber fight was really good.  The bad: Terrible acting. Natalie Portman saying ""They're killing our people,"" (or something like that) and a grueling monotone.

Two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi, discover a young boy with tremendous potential named Anakin Skywalker. Meanwhile, the mysterious Senator Palpatine has created a situation which he hopes will result in him becoming the Supreme Chancellor of the galaxy. That's somewhat brief, but it gets the point across.
The Phantom Menace is not the best Star Wars movie, then again it is not the worst. While not quite living up to A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back, many feel that it does in fact surpass Return of the Jedi, the final film of the saga. It could be said that both TPM and ROTJ both suffer due to their locations in the overall plot. TPM is the very beginning, introducing characters that will grow as the story develops, and ROTJ is the resolution (not the climax of the Saga, that's ESB), tying up all the loose ends and completing the storyline.
The acting is the same as it was in the first films. Neeson is fine as the compassionate Jedi Master who values all life, and McGregor is the perfect choice for a young Kenobi. The rest are something of a mixed bag, at times perfect, yet at times somewhat lifeless. This could be partly due to some of the dialogue, but it would be unfair to completely lay the blame there.
The effects are some of the best ever seen. Many people still don't realize that a lot of what they are seeing is an ""effect"". Many of the sets were extended and completed digitally, and there is a great variety of computer generated characters. Many complained about the abundance of ""effects"" in TPM, claiming that they distracted from the story. There is a scene in which Qui-Gon and company enter a dirty, dusty spaceport. In the background tiny little digital alien tourists walk along. This is not a distraction that harms the story, it is an effect that makes the setting seem more real. The worlds of The Phantom Menace are inhabited with creatures that lend a sense of life to the surroundings.
Many say ""Phantom Menace should have been this or that.."" What saddens me is that what these people wanted was, for the most part, a pretentious, heavy handed, dark and brooding film. I've read many ""suggestions"" as to how TPM ""should have"" been and basically, they wanted Anakin Skywalker to become Darth Vader immediately and do a bunch of evil stuff. It's not surprising that some were upset when they got a fun, kid-friendly (as Star Wars has ALWAYS been) adventure movie. And yes, the kids do like it. I couldn't help but smile when I saw a little girl (maybe 3 years old) looking at the Phantom Menace storybook with her mother, pointing at a picture of Anakin Skywalker in his podrace helmet.

When I bought the tape (the regular version), it wasn't as good, because... well it wasn't widescreen. Once I saw the widescreen, it brought back the same excitement and thrill I'd recieved the first time I watched it.  But anyway, I'm not here to diss it. Get off Jar Jar's case! Me and my sister immediately liked him and his humor. Its funny and decent. So there's a lot of loose ends. They'll most likely be covered in the next two movies. So what if the movie is more computer animated than the first three, it looks cool! The acting was not horrible, although there were some places where it could have been slightly better. What's everybody got against George Lucas anyway? I'm not defending him, but will everyone stop complaining about the stupid DVD issue and trashing all the new stuff he did in the Special Edition? I liked most of it. Watch your original versions if it bothers you so much! We wouldn't have Star Wars if it weren't for his imagination.

664390,1,6303454038,"As if the travesty of the special editions in 1997- the Jabba scene, Greedo firing first, the crappy new song and dance number in Jedi and changing the Ewok song at the end- wasn't enough, Lucas(who supposedly spent over 4 years working on the Episode I script) gives us this basically bland update of the original Star Wars film and in the process completely and irrevocably turns the Star Wars Universe on its proverbial ear.
Originally these characters were all supposed to be older- Anakin as a teenager, Obi-Wan already a Jedi Knight- but Lucas decided to make them younger and thereby created a dilemma. Obi-Wan was too young to be a Jedi Master so he had to be a disciple. Instead of having Yoda as his master(Anyone remember in the original films where Obi-Wan EXPLICITLY says that Yoda was his master?) we are introduced to a character- Qui-Gon Jinn- whom we've never heard of before.
Did Lucas even go back and watch the original trilogy for reference? It doesn't look like it. Especially when you throw in the mitichlorian nonsense. Yoda must indeed have been too old when he was training Luke in Empire Strikes Back because he never mentions these little ""creatures"" when he tells Luke all about the Force and how it works. You would think that this little ""detail"" would be important enough for Luke to know.
It may come as a shock to some of you, but not only did Lucas not direct Empire but he did not even write the screenplay. That was courtesy of Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett. After seeing The Phantom Menace, I am convinced that Lucas never even saw Empire. The Force cannot be two different things. It is either some mystical energy field that binds all living things(and exists in the space between everything) together and can be tapped into through faith and belief OR it is a power that can only be tapped into by communicating with little creatures living inside a person. It can't be both. And since Yoda's teachings in Empire came first then I consider the mitichlorian explanation an abomination.
That said, Lucas also tries too hard to connect this new film to the old ones. Anakin happened to live on Tatooine,(The planet furthest from the bright center of the universe) too? How coincidental is that? Anakin made C-3PO? How is it that Vader doesn't remember him in Empire or that 3PO doesn't make some kind of connection between Luke and Anakin? They have the same last name and Luke was on Tatooine- same as Anakin.(Here's something that's always bothered me. Why didn't they change Luke's last name if they were trying to hid him from Vader. They did it with Leia. Yet Luke keeps the last name AND lives on the planet his father grew up on. Not too bright.) Also, why doesn't Obi-Wan remember R2D2 in Star Wars. He may be older, but he still had a healthy memory. Too many little nagging questions like this ruined my first viewing of the film.
What it boils down to is that Lucas never had any idea what Episode I was going to be about until he actually sat down and started writing it. This means that he just made up the mitichlorians and all the convenient connections to the original trilogy. It's really a shame because with a really good writer, this film could have been awesome- instead of being a travesty.
I will admit, there were some nice moments in this film. However, most of them revolved around the throwaway character, Darth Maul. The underwater Gungan city was awe-inspiring and I loved the the grand architecture of Theed, but looks and visuals do not make a film great(to paraphrase Yoda) This movie had no soul and Jar Jar Binks only made matters worse. Mesa thinkin this film bombad.
You are better off watching the original films- especially Empire. However- and this is Lucas' final great insult to all the fans of the original films- you may not be able to buy them anymore. In November 2000, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition as The Star Wars Trilogy. This means that he now considers the special editions as the originals and will no longer release the original films on any home video format. So don't be too eager to get these films on DVD because you will only get Lucas' horribly revised abominations from 1997. Hold on to your Original Trilogy VHS sets and Laserdisc sets and take very good care of them 'cause you won't be able to replace them.
As for the Phantom Menace, don't expect too much when you see it and you won't be disappointed. It may be better if you have never seen the originals or if you are still a young kid. I know my nephew loved the film and he was only 8 when he saw it.(The same age I was when Star Wars came out in 1977)",982108800,20,4640,4.571428571428571

When Jar Jar opened his mouth to speak, my first thought was:  ""You're kidding.  For the whole movie?!"" If the first Star Wars was a box of Cracker Jacks that was all prizes, The Phantom Menace is a box of Cracker Jacks that's all diagrams of prizes. It's there on paper, but it's waiting to be filled in and jazzed up.  Unlike the first, er, fourth film, the acting contains nary a trace of camp.  Regrettably, it ain't got much zest, either.

But seriously, 'Menace' has got to be one of the most poorly executed films in history. Indeed, most people who hate 'Menace', are hardcore Star Wars fans; they just haven't sacrificed taste on the alter of obsession. In fact, I think that the 'lean and hungry' George Lucas from 1977 would even be horrifed at 'Menace'.
This flick is one whopping bore of a movie, a collection of computer generated images devoid of feeling, emotion and above all the very reality of human existence. It would rival Tarkovsky's Solaris as the most sleep-inducing science fiction film of all time, if not for the deafening prowess of THX technicians and the constant onslaught of explosions. Even John Williams' music is his worst score since Amistad. It is a collection of excerpts from the previous three films and the new compositions introduced sound as if they've been reluctantly written. When I first saw it, I found myself playing the game of ""Spot the ILM Effect."" Sequences seen in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Waterworld, Starship Troopers, Robocop, the original Star Wars trilogy and Jurassic Park.
""Only a movie,"" says the great bearded guru. Yes, well, 'The Phantom Menace' is shameless in its pilfering of scenes from blockbusters. Whatever your thoughts are on the Star Wars universe, the ""charm"" and ""humor"" of the original three films have been reduced by Lucas, the ""great auteur,"" to cutesy moments aimed primarily at avid watchers of Teletubbies. Lucas apparently never met a clich&eacute; he didn't swoon over. His script is a muddled piece of idiocy, more hack job than Joseph Campbell. As a director, he treats his actors worse than ignoble props, sacrificing the vital human moments they need to express for the sake of his gratuitous digital effects and allowing them to speak their inane lines with bland monotony and all the emotional impact of a plate of Brussel sprouts. His direction is so flat that he makes Hitchcock, who once dismissed actors as mere cattle and insisted that the motivation behind a performance was a paycheck, look like the greatest Method director who ever lived. And do you really think Ep. II will be better?? Like he would 'change' his style....Why should he? He's surrounded himself with so much wealth and power, he could release a film worse than 'Menace' and still rake in millions.

From that point onward, I was once again drawn into the world of Star Wars and when the movie ended, I was excited, exhilirated and disappointed (that it ended). Yes, I loved this movie as much as the second installment.
For all those who despised this movie and complained about the lack of character development, maybe you need to go back and watch Episode IV. There wasn't that much character development there either. It was a swashbuckling, space adventure period. Not much of a human element to it at that time, and that's what is was meant to be.
The characters during the Empire regime did NOT develop themselves in The New Hope. The actual development of the characters didn't come through until Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back and it wasn't completed until the end of Episode VI.
Episode I sets the ground for Anakin's fall from Jedi to Darth Vader. The next episode builds on Anakin's training as well as introducing us to Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru, so we'll hopefully gain some more insight as to how they are really related to Luke because in Episode I, Anakin was an only child (as far as we know). So whose ""Uncle"" and ""Aunt"" are they really? Or, is that how Luke was raised to believe?
The only other thing I don't know at this time is, will we find out who Luke's mother really is? IS it the Queen? If so, what happens to her after Anakin becomes Darth Vader? These questions should hopefully be answered by the end of Episode III, since that will show Anakin's downfall to Darth Sidious/Emperor Palpatine.
The characters will be fully defined at that point. But then, who needs to know? We KNOW what Senator Palpatine is like. We KNOW who Anakin will become. We already know about Obi Wan in some respects.
As for Jar Jar, call me crazy, but I liked him. I didn't think he was annoying. Maybe it's still the kid in me (and my 5 year daughter loves him). Maybe I still have that quality I had when I was 11 years old and saw Star Wars for the first time in the theatres. Overall, it was a way to get a new generation of children introduced to Star Wars. Heck, go back and watch the antics between C3PO and R2D2. They were there for comic relief as well. Look at what happens to C3PO and all the things he says. He can be just as clumsy as Jar Jar. But, noone complains about him. In fact, I remember C3PO and R2D2 being compared to Laurel and Hardy when Star Wars first came out. They added some comic relief with the banter that went on between them.
Episode I has me excited for the next two installments to see how Anakin falls to the Emperor and how the Empire eventually comes into power. We already know how it started with Palpatine becoming Chancelor. Plus, C3PO won't have to join a nudist colony since he'll finally get some coverings.
On a different note, did anyone notice during the scenes in the Senate where ET makes an appearance? I didn't notice that in the theatres, but I did in the movie. My 5-year-old daughter loves it since she loves ET.
If you're a TRUE Star Wars fan, this movie is a must-see and is very enjoyable, even with some loopholes in the story, such as Obi Wan stating he was trained by Yoda in Empire Strikes Back and it ends up being Qui Gon. Of course, once Qui Gon was killed, Yoda could still be a ""mentor"" to Obi Wan. Who's to say a Jedi's training is done once he's given the title of Jedi? There's always more to learn, even in real life.

I don't think that this movie was necesarily better than the first one, I just enjoyed watching it more (probably I didn't appreciate movies as much when I first saw ""Star Wars"").  The special effects were outstanding, just as the script was.  The unknown actors did a good job at saying their lines as well.  Everybody except for Anakin Skywalker, it's obvious that this was his first movie.  I agree with one of the other reviews, Haley Joel Osment would have made this a five-star movie, but he doesn't look at all like someone related to Luke Skywalker.  Whaterver this kid's name is, he acted a lot like Luck may act when he was a boy, and looked a lot like him, so that was defenatly why he got the part.  Besides that, this movie was awesome.  Darth Maul's face amazed me, god knows how long that make-up job took.  The pod-race was unbelievable, same with the ending  fight scene between Darth Maul, Obi Wan Kenobi, and Qui Gon Jin.  I think that this movie will impress more of a audience between the ages of 8-18.  So if you have your youth, go get this movie, you'll love it!",980812800,,1150,4.322429906542056

However, for the average fan like myself, ""The Phantom Menace"" was mediocre at best. Let's face it, Lucas had over 14 years to come up with a solid script for Episode I. Instead we got a bad episode of ""Lost In Space"".(My apologies to Dr. Smith!) Hollywood once again created a beautiful fantasy world but not any interesting characters to inhabit it(Jake Lloyd played Anakin as a little twit). The story raised more questions that it answered(the characters refered to events that happened before this movie; Episode I). Great actors were given some truly awful lines(from the look on Natalie Portman's face she wanted off this leaky Lucasfilm ship). And as a final insult to fans, George decided to release it in VHS only (Mr. Lucas have you no shame sir?)... There are 20 seconds of promos before the movie when there could have been some additional footage or interviews. I will say that credit is due to Ray Park for doing a fantastic job with Darth Maul. As the final light sabre battle is well choreographed and actually pretty exciting. Buy it used for that reason but don't buy it new.

People are natural complainers, but I had a grand ol' time watching this (3 times) in the theater and owning the video now.
Very few movies are perfect, yet most people EXPECTED this one would be.  Like any movie, it has it's problems I'm sure (whatever each person thinks), but George Lucas is not God, he's just a man who makes movies.  And this one I thought was very good.  I look forward to the next two chapters.
My only complaint is not about the CONTENT of the movie, it's just a disappointment in the fact that the DVDs are not available and the rumors that Mr. Lucas will NOT make chapters VII, VIII, & IX!

664463,4,6303454038,"...  This is somewhat disappointing, especially considering the unfair way in which many have regarded the film.  There's no need to arguer with these people -- I, for one, admit and accept that this film is not going to have me as thrilled as ""Star Wars"" or ""Empire Strikes Back"" because, frankly, I haven't been watching Episode I on the VCR weekly since I was 6 years old, as I have with the original trilogy.
With any movie that recieves this much hype, it's not going to be possible for it to live up to the expectations.  I'm not entirely sure what people expected -- obviously not an exciting, inventive, finely crafted action/adventure film, which is what they got.  Yes, characterization is admittedly spotty, and some of the dialogue is only what you'd find in a sci-fi serial or a comic book or mythology...which, as I recall, is exactly what Lucas was going for in 1977, as well.  Yes, there are so many special effects that they at times threaten to overtake the rest of the film.  And, yes, I enjoyed the film immensely.  The Star Wars saga is like a bit of modern mythology -- characters larger than life, worlds so elaborate and detailed that we have to stare back in awe, action sequences that push the envelope of what has been done before.  Like it or not, Lucas' films have woven their way into our popular culture; just because this film didn't live up to impossible expectations doesn't change that.  As a member of the saga, I found it enjoyable -- not up to the ""Star Wars"" freshness or the perfection of ""Empire"", but it's a step-up from the rushed wrap-up of ""Return of the Jedi"".
What I respect and appreciate about the Phantom Menace, as with the rest of the saga, is Lucas' obvious love for his creation -- it shows in every frame, every detail.  It may not be wholly original, but ... it isn't fun to get ... into his universe for a couple of hours.  It is a MOVIE, after all, and for what it attempts -- to craft an entertaining story in an imaginary universe that has been established in 3 previous films -- it suceeds admirably.",979603200,2,2061,4.483957219251337
664464,4,6303454038,"Why did Lucas make the movie?  Qui-Gon himself says that the trade dispute was trivial, hardly worth a Jedi's time.
Many reviewers said that this movie had no plot, as if nothing happened.  Yet, this may be the point Lucas is driving at.
It only looked trivial.  But all of the events necessary to overthrow the Republic took place, and nobody even noticed!
It took only a careful and daring exploitation of the weaknesses of the Republic to set in motion its destruction.
To me the movie is wonderfully entertaining, focused, and subtle in its rendering of an evil man's rise to power.
So subtle that I think many missed it.  As happens in real life.",979603200,5,651,4.586206896551724

It was a mistake picking Jake Lloyd and I don't know what was going on in their heads when they did. He spoke in monotone and had no expression on his face at all throughout the movie and when he tired, it looked really chessy. And Jar-Jar was just as bad or worse. He is another alien creature to add comedy to the movie. I laughed but at how stupid it was. I remember the original movies were so funny with the driods and Chewbacca and the Ewoks were cute but suprissingly this was a let down. But besides those two actors the movie was great.

664466,2,6303454038,"Now that we've gotten two bad ""Star Wars"" movies in a row, does that mean the anticipation for the SW2 will be a little less insane?
I didn't think so.
Singing Ewoks, crappy production values, bad writing and an embarassing plot didn't sink ""Return of the Jedi"" -- and there are adults who say, with a straight face, that they actually enjoyed it -- so I guess it's no surprise that TPM has its defenders, too.
To be fair, it's not awful in the way that, say, ""Deep Blue Sea,"" ""Instinct"" or ""Highlander 2"" are awful. It's just not very good.
It does have nice production values, and you can see the money on the screen. The beautiful costumes and sets, amazing CGI graphics, spectacular jedi battles and even the sort of pointless space combat are all done extremely well and hold up as the best parts of the movie.
But then there's the writing. Is George Lucas surrounded by people incapable of telling him no? Where was the outcry when he gave us simpering Asian stereotypes as evil stooges of the future Emperor? Where was the outcy over Jar-Jar Binks? Where was the outcry over Anakin's immaculate conception? Where was the outcry over the idea that being a good manipulator of the Force depends on bacteria in your bloodstream? Honestly, the writing end of TPM is like bad fan fiction.
The worst part is that it was all salvageable. The quasi-Asian aliens could lose the accents and be more or less fine. Jar-Jar Binks could have used the same and NOT opened the cart at the end by accident. Dump the crap about immaculate conception entirely and say Annakin's father has been dead, presumed missing, since his mother was pregnant. And cut the midichlorians discussion on the balcony.
Boom. Right there, another star for the movie, just by cutting out the worst stuff. It still wouldn't measure up to the first two movies -- they had actual good stuff in them, instead of just an absence of bad stuff -- but TPM wouldn't have been a real stain on Lucas' record. With ""The Phantom Menace,"" he's provided critics with ammunition for decades to come, who are already deriding him as a terrible screenwriter, stiff director and an auteur who put his ego ahead of his story.
And that's a shame. The promise of the first two films increasingly seems like it was a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.",979257600,11,2304,4.581113801452784

The movie didn't make any sense to me, until I read some of the preliminary writing for the movie (which I read after seeing it).

It's like the first half of a miniseries, or a premier episode of a tv show.  It doesn't have the strength to stand alone the way the other Star Wars films do.  The dissapointment with this film sprang primarily from the absence of a satisfactory ending. But Spawn did that to me as well. I still saw it again, and I don't complain. Why?  Because it's PRETTY.  I like pretty things.  If you want a powerful plot, brilliant acting, intense action it's not here. It's not in Spawn either for that matter. But if you want to look at something pretty that doesn't tax your brain this is a brilliant, detailed taspestry of vibrant colour. You can watch it again and again and see new things every time. It's not a work of cinematic genius, Lucas leaves that to Kubrick (rest his soul) but it's really really pretty, and you don't have to think about it, just look at it.  Furthermore, the special effects advances that all four existing Star Wars films (and Spawn) have inspired or downright produced allow other directors can make better, more mentally taxing, awe inspiring, films with storylines and dialogue.

There is one thing I agreewith, KILL JAR-JAR BINKS. I loved Ewoks, but I hated JarJar. ""Live Creatures"" impress me more that computersimulated crap. A guy with an elaborate make up job, in a suit, or apuppet (like Yoda) can actually interact with the actors and itshows. Thier was something more realistic about the pre-specialedition Star Wars movies because of lack of money. There is adifference between rough and fake. Computer characters lookphony. Luke's Tatooine had a rough raw background. The gungans lookedfake. When you can see that it's fake, it's less intresting ---computer generated characters are not missed by the naked eye. AlsoJar-Jar's dialogue and clumsiness was a clumsy attempt at comedy thatturned away fans the way Wicket never could.
As a stand alone, mostpeople would not come back to the Phantom Menace. The highlyadvertised Darth Maul (who's part was to small for me to be impressedby him) has little to do... Unlike the on going war in the OriginalTrilogy, the galaxy is basically at peace and (absent of the OT) wedon't know that Palapatine is the ""Evil figure"" that willbring it all down. But the Oiginals do exsist, this is a prequel -- weknow the story --- which is part of the problem.
The plot issketchy at best and the characters had bad dialogue espciallyAnakin. Lloyd can't help being a cute kid --that's what he was supposeto be. How many ways can you read ""yipee"" or exclaim""wizard"", without coming off bubble gum cute when you ARE acute kid. As a part of the whole Saga, this was actuallyintresting. Anakin was just some kid, like any kid, meaning all of usare prone to darkness. Call me a sucker for a good romance, but hiscrush on the Queen (which we all know will turn to mutual love)actually appealed to me and I am very intrested in the future of thisromance. However, they could have dropped the ""choosen one""- the force is his daddy - Jedi christ child angle and themidio-vermine count. Tho force was better before they made itdependant on the vermine.
Qui-Gon's exsistance made Obi-Wan out tobe a bigger (well more creative) liar than the Original Trilogy did. Despite this, I liked seeing Obi-Wan's simple beginings and Qui-Gonwas the most intresting character in the entire film. And his request...for Obi-Wan to train Anakin actually makes his commitment to thefamily all the more solid and important.

I understand that it can be difficult to go backwards from the previous movies and provide earlier information, but this can push even an understanding man's patience.  For the most part, the pace is sluggish and even annoying at times. Darth Maul (the main villain) speaks twice in the whole movie. There is too much hindsight involving Anakin. (I understand that there should be some indications of his eventual fate, but it should have been more subtle and ambiguous.) Liam Neeson carries over 90 % of this movie. He is the only person who saves this from being a complete disaster. (He seems to be the only one in the cast who realizes the importance of acting and character development.)

664563,1,6303454038,"Well, my heading says it all. `The Phantom Menace' is littered with faults in terms of acting, directing, scriptwriting, style and special effects, and is saved (if that term can be used in association with a lost cause) only by the blossoming talent of Natalie Portman, who has come a long way since `Leon'. Now before you start saying that I'm criticising the film only because I'm against Star Wars, I'll confess that, though not a huge fan, the original Star Wars (Episode IV) was a darned good yarn which had class (Alec Guinness), vitality (Harrison Ford/Mark Hamill), a truly great villain (James Earl Jones) and incredible special effects (the trench sequence still puts current-day imitations to shame). Episode I, on the contrary, feels like a lazy cash-in that was given no attention to detail, no thought and no effort from the writers, directors, producers or actors. As a result, without the success of Star Wars this film is nothing.
In terms of story, Episode I falls flat. Rather than being a movie, it is a `let's-fill-in-the-blanks-that-don't-need-filling-in' piece of filmmaking, and thus, rather than telling a story, it feels like an episode of a television show, Xena: Warrior Princess, for example. And, like television, the characters have no depth whatsoever and do not develop; at least Han, Luke and Leia had `issues', not to mention personalities. Furthermore, the special effects are diabolical. Yes, they are stunning at showing what computers are now capable of, but they DON'T LOOK REAL. At times you think it's a Pixar film, especially in the battle between the Gungans and the automated Federation soldiers, because the visuals could have been lifted from `A Bug's Life' or `Toy Story', which is bad when you consider that this is a live-action rather than animation film. Added to this, actors are frequently chroma-keyed into obviously computerised backgrounds, which are spotlessly clean, sterile, flat and unbelievably low-budget - whatever happened to building a set, small-scale modelling, linear rather than CGI animation? All it comes down to is that in the 1970's, with extremely limited computer technology, Lucasfilm was able to make a movie that looked and felt ten times more real than this one.
Overall, this is a disappointing beginning to what was touted as the most eagerly-anticipated film series of recent years. I (perhaps naively) thought that the film was about the guy in all the film-posters, Darth Maul, but his eight-or-so minutes of film time kind-of don't satisfy. And, looking forward to Ewan McGregor's proven acting talents, the only thing I was impressed by was his English accent. And, of course, there was that much-talked-about pod-racing sequence, which looked identical to the Playstation game, so that tells you precisely how realistic it was. I can only hope that Episode II is given a slightly larger budget, a hell-of-a-lot more effort, and stacks more of the creative flair that made Lucas his name all those years ago.

664564,4,6303454038,"Like the bulk of those out there I patiently awaited the next installment to the Star Wars Universe ever since I first learned that there were going to possibly be additional films to the original Episodes 4, 5 & 6 (I think I learned about this sometime between the release of 'Empire' and 'Jedi').  I wasn't a fanatic who waited in line for days or even weeks like some, but I WAS fortunate enough to see it the day before release and as I sat through it, I couldn't help but wonder: 'What is WRONG with the critics?!  I LOVE this movie!'  I really DID.  I think the MAJOR problem that most people had with Episode I was after having waited for so long, many had come up with their OWN ideas of HOW the movie should go, so much so that by the time the movie came out there was NOTHING that could have possibly made them satisfied.
With that said, I DID however find one very MAJOR and GLARING error with Episode I:  From the earlier movies we discover that Obi Wan was trained as a Jedi BY YODA but for some odd reason George Lucas has decided to alter this established course by having Obi Wan trained by Qui Gon Jin.  Now while I enjoyed the character played by Liam Neeson (one of my favorite parts of the entire movie, in fact) I found that deep down I just could not find it in my heart to forgive Lucas for taking such a HUGE departure from his OWN story!  Now that being a small (but significant) complaint, I still found the movie visually stunning (how could it NOT be?) but I also feel deep down that the starships of the original trilogy were way more cool than the ones featured in Episode I (did anyone else notice that Princess Amidala's ship looked suspiciously like a silver suped-up version of the SR-71 spy plane?).

I lost a lot of respect for George Lucas for using [poor] computer generated special effects instead of using  miniatures as they had done in the past. He probably saw  'the matrix' and said, yea I can do that. But he could not.
The plot was thin, the characters not even close to being engaging. Darth Maul (only exciting character) did not have enough presence to be anything close to Darth Vader.

And finally we are explained what the force is. The result of I don't want to know what process happening in tiny organism inside our blood. I though you needed a jedi master to control the force.

664568,5,6303454038,"I became a Star Wars fan in the summer of 1999. I saw Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace before viewing the original trilogy. At first, I didn't get it. I was brought into this galaxy with no since of what was going on. But later, I rented the other movies and began to really appreciate the saga that is Star Wars.
Although I'm sure everyone has seen this movie, I will give the basic plot just in case someone hasn't seen it. The Trade Federation controls the trade routes of many planets; yet they want to gain more power. When the Galactic Senate refuses to give them more control, Darth Sidious makes a deal with the Federation to start an invasion of the peaceful planet of Naboo, in order to force the Senate into giving them power. But it is really part of a plan to give more power to Sidious himself, so he can finally get revenge on the Jedi and begin a new form of government - The Empire, which already exists in the original trilogy. When all this happens, the Jedi Knights get involved to save Naboo. That's all I will say; I don't want to spoil the experience.
Many people dislike this movie for not having as much character development as in the original trilogy. I agree to that, but I still don't dislike it. We explore the plot much more in this film, since it is so complex. But the simple ""good vs. "" plot in the trilogy left so much room to know the characters inside and out. This movie is just different from the others, making it a fresh new way to look at the Star Wars universe.
Everybody hates Jar Jar. He irritates me too. But lets really look at it from Lucas's standpoint. He wants his movies to appeal to everyone. I can clearly understand that. Around the time Return of the Jedi rolled around, he probably thought, ""Gee, I should put something in here that little kids would like."" So he added the ewoks. I think everyone has a certain pressure put on them to say they ""hate"" the ewoks and Jar Jar as well. But I must say that they didn't ruin the movies for me at all. Star Wars has recently become a bigger hit with little kids as a result of these creatures, and I think that is just fine.
Everyone wants this movie as well as the others on DVD. I want them too, but don't sweat it. Everybody waits until they can sell the most of their movies on VHS until they release them on DVD. Lucas is doing the same thing. And I am sure that when they come out, it will be best DVDs ever made, with tons of extras and featurettes.
Everyone should own Episode I and the original trilogy - the entire saga. Lucas has made it possible for everyone to own his mythological, timeless tales - especially with re-releasing the Star Wars Trilogy again. Don't wait, go out and buy every one of these movies. It won't be regretted. All I can say is that the saga gives me a fantastic world to visit when I want great entertainment! Bring on Episodes II and III!",976233600,3,2886,4.268248175182482

I spent some extra cash buying a midnight madness ticket to be one of the first in my town to see it. I saw it a few more times hoping I had missed something. I tried to make myself like this movie because afterall it's ""Star Wars"" but I've given up...
I really don't need to mention Jar Jar because everyone knows how horrible of an idea that was. You can compare him to the Ewoks all you want but at least the Ewoks weren't spouting off 90's pop culture references and silly childish jokes. There was something MUCH less annoying with the Ewoks talking in a foreign tongue while we can unfortunately understand everything Jar Jar says. Jar Jar is often used when it feels he should have no part in the scene and his presence is the equivalent of a needle in the retina. This character has spawned a host of Anti-Jar Jar web pages and even a web ring.
The characters are pretty lifeless. I didn't find myself caring for them as I did in the original series and I found the character interaction to be pretty bland. The acting was just so cold and without feeling. The liberal use of computer graphics added to this.
More specifically, the computer graphics effects were hugely over-the-top and I felt they took away from the movie. It felt like watching a video game in parts because the enviornment was so heavily computer generated (and I could easily tell). This just added to the lifelessness of the movie.  I couldn't believe this was the prequel to the series I had grown up loving.
It's always sad when a great idea gets overly modernized and commercialized and this is one of the grimmest examples. (Those of you who saw the original Mr. Bean tv series and then the movie may have an idea of what I mean).
I did enjoy the duel at the end with Darth Maul. The anticpation of Kenobi and Maul about to get it on while waiting for the electronic wall to go off was great. Unfortunately I wasn't just looking for eye candy.
This isn't just a rush to judgement review on my part but a sad, slow realization of how much better this movie could've been. I'm not ripping on this movie because it may be the popular thing to do, this is genuine.

I'm sure everyone's tired of hearing about how bad the JarJar Binks character was, but on the other hand, maybe George will ditch him for something less marketable and more personable in the next two movies. Also dissapointing was the overabundance of CG animation. No matter how impressive computers are nowadays, it's still incredibley hard to fool the human eye, and Mr. Lucas actually did a better job scavenging battleship models and using puppets to create his special effects in the first trilogy. This movie wasn't a total loss however. The droids remained unchanged, and Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor are well on their way to making memorable characters.

Some people have said that the tedious nature, trite dialogue and  wooden characterizations can be forgiven because this is merely 1/6th of the entire Saga.  My friends, I prefer to think of it as two hours of my life that I can never get back. Whether it was 1/8th, 2/15ths or 100% of a story is not important.. what's imprtant was this movie did not reflect ANY of the BASIC elements necessary to create an effective, moving story.  Yes, the choreography was beautiful; yes, the music was good, but I can go to the ballet for that.  TPM did not *move* me.  Its characters did not touch me (except for Darth Maul who sadly was killed at the end; and Anakin's mom who we will probably never see again); its words were so hoary I had to dust myself off every so often; its plot was paper thin as to have deceived one into thinking Roger Corman had his hand in its production.
My friends, this is not about the next two movies, or how TPM fits in with the original three..  this is about how TPM stand by itself as a movie, as a story.

You simply can't deny the awesome scale that this movie has.  The dialogue, depsite what people say, is not kiddy material.  It's meant to be taken very seriously.

664615,4,6303454038,"I thought ""The Phantom Menace"" is a great movie for a couple reasons.  Let me first address the most apticipated, and heavily criticized first story in what will soon be the greatest sextet ever.  You must first remember that one of the hardest things to do, in Sci-Fi no less, is work backwards. People in this genre pay too close attention to detail and would catch the smallest of inaccuracy.  With that being said, Episode 1 did what it should have done, provided a background for the coming 5 movies.  Episodes 4-6 were so great because the movies started with a plot and a conflict, Episode 1 had to provide it's own.  The Dual Scene at the end is very well thought out and emotional as well.  The scene where Darth Mual, Quin-Jon, and Obi-Won are waiting for those laser partitions to shut off is very intense.  There are two faults for this movie: Jar-Jar Binks and CGI.  Jar-Jar Binks is one of the worst characters in Sci-Fi lore and Lucas overused the CGI technology.  Other than that, buy this movie because it's the first staple in what will become the greatest saga ever.",974851200,2,1085,4.551546391752577
664616,1,6303454038,"I am a huge Star Wars fan, but found TPM totally, unbeliveably disgusting. I hate it. The plot is weak, and there is too much of technology without a 'human' element which so beautifully adored all the three films of the trilogy. The movie feels completely mechanical. The appearance of the Queen is repelling, and Darth Maul, far from looking dangerous, appears more like a painted clown (oh - can any one match the personality of Darth Vader?) Jar Jar Binks is absolutely out of place, and Lucas screwed this movie for Jar Jar, if not for anything else. He does not even look real (compare with Chewbacca from the trilogy who looked remarkably real) - all a curse of too much technology and little heart or substance. And his comedy is all irritating. I am really surprised how Lucas could have made such a disgusting movie. Probably it's no surprise; everyone goes the same way - after you reach a plateau there's a straight fall down to an abyss. Spielberg and his The Lost World are a good example. There is absolutely no comparison of the beauty, the message, the story, the human element, in the Trilogy, with this one. A HUGE LETDOWN, AND A TOTAL DISGRACE.",974678400,14,1164,4.600961538461538
664617,3,6303454038,"Thanks, George, for finally giving us this film, or more accurately, the first in the coming trilogy. Lucas claims that he was waiting for the FX technology to get good enough before embarking on the next stories. Though this may be true, the claim does not bear close examination. I think 75% percent of this film's effects could have been adequately done 5 years ago. But don't you see? The effects are no longer even half the appeal of Star Wars anymore, if they ever actually were to anyone but the shallow-minded. Science fiction fans and Star Wars fans in particular hunger for THE STORY. And that is going to be what people will hang out for from now on. THAT is probably as it should be. George Lucas has the chance to expand his already big kudos and pallete of achievement with this movie and it's follow-ups. I think he'll do it if he goes for the real operatic possibilities and plays down the cute stuff. Do I mean Jar Jar Binks? Er... Let's SO not go there now, okay! I found the Trade Federation official's 'Charlie Chan' psuedo-Asian accents embarrassing. The Asian family sitting next to me in the theater seemed rather bemused. Darkness must fall to satisfy the dramatic cravings of Star Wars fans. George, don't be afraid, you CAN do it! What's this film like? It's a good start, but at the risk of insulting Lucas, there is a homogenised feel to the performances and direction, a lack of dramatic bite in those areas. Effects? Yeah, they're there but they are so good you hardly worry about them, only the story. Jake Lloyd is okay as Anakin Skywalker but I think he was a little too young for the role. Someone closer to Natalie Portman's age might have made more sense but I'm sure George had his reasons for casting him.  The Lightsaber duels are superb and it's only during those sequences and the pod race does the films' action sequences come alive. And it was pretty cunning for Lucas to use droid warriors for the heroes to shoot and hack up. Much less violent than using real flesh-and-blood people, eh? And what about the 'Midi-Chlorians' (or whatever) explanation for The Force? That seemed to be a needless, psuedo-scientific contrivance for something that should remain mysterious and hard to explain.

664619,5,6303454038,"I have to say that The Phantom Menace does not deserve the wave of complaint it has received lately. Now, when I read some movie reviews, I see lines like, ""This film, unlike Episode One, meets all the hype."" TPM has become a symbol of the disappointing movie!
But I'm here to say that it was not disappointing at all.
The Phantom Menace is an experience to behold, a marvel in storytelling, and worthy of the name Star Wars. It's a completely enthralling continuation of one of film's greatest tales. It must be seen. It has some of the best, most intense action you will ever see in a film. It is a rich, detailed epic of the rise of evil, with the themes, symbolism, and roots in mythology that keep the story going while the thrills keep it exciting.
This film should be commended for the visual richness it has. It is a masterwork of effects and images. So much detail is crammed into almost every scene; settings are populated with aliens, robots, and other things going on. George Lucas takes care to make the movie's sceneries, characters, aliens, and ships very detailed and turns it into an art. Thanks to the development of the effects and the attention to the aliens' bodies' own physics, the life-forms interact (and, to an extent, act) with the real human actors as if they were humans themselves. Wondrous settings like Gungan City and Coruscant each have their own characteristic traits. The costumes of Amidala, Maul, and others are likewise very detailed and impressive. All this makes the galaxy seem so real and convincing.
The action and thrill-factor are the most important elements of this film. Make no mistake about it. The excitement one gets from watching this film, through the action, is unbelievable. It is the type of action standard to Star Wars, but by no means standard. It's one of the fastest and most unrelenting action films ever, and it's ages beyond the previous films in terms of its intensity. The pod-racing scene is extremely fast and there's always a sense of constant motion one feels during this scene; not just from the velocity of the racers, but via details like the screeching engines and the hulls buckling under pressure from wind sheer. There are classic shootouts within palace halls, and even war-scale battles on the surface of Naboo. But the best example to illustrate the amazing thrills in this movie is the final lightsaber duel sequence. Not only is it better than all the previous duels, it is the perfect action scene overall. The duel itself is a complicated (a two-on-one) and incredibly fast masterpiece. The choreography is amazing, as we see the fighters compete with complex movements with swiftness and grace. John Williams composes the score for this film, and it shines. It's a brilliant score, with many nuances and memorable anthems and themes, one of them being the powerful and classic choral track Duel of the Fates, which plays during this scene. It is amazing how well all these elements converge in this scene, as in all the other action scenes in the film, to create awe-inspiring thrills. The music, the great action, and the dramatic camera movements combine to create a fight that seems symbolic in importance.
The Phantom Menace stands on its own as also having a grand, epic, and multi-layered story. Many aspects of the story can be overlooked or missed, probably because there's so much action and FX used on the surface that it may be hard to go down beneath the surface and realize that there is a good plot going on. But in reality the film actually contains many themes. There are the ideas of unity (episode one, the origin) and duality (the dual identities of Palpatine and Amidala, the twin forces within Anakin). The film is full of mythology: Darth Maul is as terrifying as any classic mythological figure; Anakin has the elements of the Chosen One in him; the final duel scene is a ""Duel of the Fates"", and it's no coincidence that the title of that part of the score has that name. (The Fates were three Greek gods in charge of human life; three gods, and three fighters in this duel, with Anakin's life in the balance.) Also, the prequels are eventually going to be about the triumph of evil, and how that happens. We know that because in this episode we see our first look at it, through Palpatine and the introduction of Anakin. The foreshadowing at the end, when it comes, is brilliant. The heroes don't even know that they've just been defeated.
All of the above is why Episode One is superb. With the originality to chronicle the three-part Fall From Grace of one of the most fascinating characters in cinema history, the creativity that's represented in details like Darth Maul's face-of-evil makeup design, some of the greatest action scenes of all time, and the visual brilliance which takes us back to that galaxy far away, this film actually deserved to make as much money at the box office as it did; and this film does NOT deserve the recent trend of public backlash it's been getting. No film should be allowed to make money based solely on a name. But Star Wars: Episode One is indeed a genuinely excellent film, and does live up to that name.
We are so extremely fortunate that we're here right when Lucas has begun the next SW trilogy. It's quite fascinating when one thinks about it. I am giddy over the fact that there are still two more movies to come. And if they are as great as this one was (although I expect Episodes II and III to focus more on story and a little less on action), they'll become instant classics.",973123200,5,5538,4.6810256410256414
664660,4,6303454038,"I am a big movie buff.  I don't like typical action films (e.g., John Woo) and I stay away from Hollywood romantic comedies.  However, I STILL liked this movie, despite the incredible amount of criticism that surrounded it.
Granted, Jar-Jar Binks is annoying and there were not any chracters that really stood out (a la Han Solo style).  Nonetheless, I still chalk this up as a movie that IS worthy of being in the Star Wars vein.  But just barely.
Ewan McGregor was truly the best actor in this film as Obi Wan - I look forward to seeing him in the future Star Wars movie.  He can carry himself as well as any Jedi I know. :-)  Unfortunately, Lloyd's stilted and forced acting as Anakin Skywalker makes me relieved that we won't be seeing him again.
Some people I know found that the plot was too complex - wranglings between the Federation and the Republic seemed too political somehow, it has been said.  But I liked the shadow of what is to come (dare I say, The Phantom Menace?) and eagerly await seeing how the Empire grows.  And what is it that turns Skywalker into Darth Vader?
I think that there are some problems with the film, but I saw it twice and loved it each time.  And, remember, this is just a set up for the rest of the movies.",972950400,2,1246,4.336206896551724
664661,5,6303454038,"I am getting fed up with people that berate this movie simply because they do not understand it or can't think beyond the surface level.  Yes, Jar Jar was irritating.  However, since when does everyone speak perfect basic (as English is known as in the SW universe)?  Just on this planet called Earth, we have thousands of different dialects of English, many of which are barely understandable by ""American"" English speakers.  Why wouldn't this be duplicated on a galactic scale, especially for an isolationist race, such as the gungungs, who don't have much use for, or chance to speak, basic?  Jar Jar's clumsiness is Lucas' Redemption Character theory (see: Ewoks).  No matter how bumbling stumbling stupid you are, you too can save the galaxy.  We can only hope that Lucas realizes that 10 years have gone by between P.M. and Episode 2, so Jar Jar will have plenty of time to study proper basic.
 Next, Metichlorines:  I did not like this explaination at first.  However, when I stopped to think about it, it does make sense.  It does NOT explain the Force.  It only explains the heredity of the force, why certain people can become Jedi and others can't.  The higher concentration of metichlorines you have, the better you can communicate with this mystical Force.  Given the fact that finding Force sensitivity, and Force heredity, is a very large part of the Star Wars story, this is a good explaination of it.
 Ok, the story: Any body who complains about how dull the story is remember this: Phantom Menace is not ""A,"" ""One,"" movie, in and of itself.  It is 1/6th of a movie.  A lot of people did not like Empire when it first came out because of the ending.  However, a lot of people today agree that Empire is the best (perhaps not favorite) of the original 3 due to story telling, cinimatography, and the like.  When you look at P.M. with the rest of the Star Wars stories, I think you will agree that the story is amazing and fits very well.  Perhaps you should read one of the books (Heir to the Empire, by Timothy Zahn is a great start).  This, at least, would tell you the name of the Emperor (creepy old dude shooting lightning bolts in Jedi) and who he was before becoming Emperor.  (Yes, the character is in P.M.)  Now, I will agree that the acting could have been better, but come on... Mark Hamill?

Ok, bottom line is that Phantom Menace is not one movie but a single part of an entire story.  If you look at it as such, coupled with the (and I don't think anyone can disagree with this) SPECTACULAR special effects, I think you will agree that this is a great movie, worthy of the name Star Wars.  Even great enough to challenge Jedi as my favorite of the movies (though that has mostly to do with the fact that the Emperor's character is my favorite Star Wars character, and he doth rocketh much in this movie, if you know who he is...

These overwhelm the few attempts to give us suspense and drama...which fail for anyone familiar with adventure stories because they are tired and obvious.  Disappointingly little is done with the capable cast.  And when familiar characters appear, they give us no additional insight into who they are (or why their role in this movie is necessary).  Granted, the film-maker had a great burden of viewer expectations to handle...but one would hope that these expectations might have been used beneficially.  Rather it seems they were avoided in order to provide something that no one else had suggested.  Of course, this movie also had to fit into the series and needed to lay the groundwork for the planned sequels.  But it should have been designed to stand on its own.

664667,5,6303454038,"a) It wasn't as intense and action-packed as the first 3 films.
Obviously, this is true. But look at the film for a sec.
- It's based 30 years before episode 4. - It's a lot more elegant and peaceful time in the universe. - No one is really up for violent bloodbaths and money is not the major driving force for most people.
  ""Our security volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened federation army.""  - Captain Pinaka
- The peacfulness was obviously suppsed to be explained toe the viewers visually rather than verbally. Look at the costumes and palaces, etc. You never see anything like that in ep. 4, 5, + 6 because everyone is so caught up in their own personal being rather than functioning as one society as a whole.
b) It's childish
- I do kind of agree with you here, but I see it as being relevant to make it a childish movie partially to gain a new audience. Remember that fans of these movies are 20+ years older now, and a new wave of Star Wars fans need to be bred. Episodes 2+3 will definately be better for those who were expecting the serious dramatic feel to the first film.
c) Special effects
- Were there too many? Were they good enough?
I don't think there were too many. As long as I can't tell the difference from real + effect when I watch the movie, I'm fine. But were they good enough? In some parts, no they weren't. When Qui-Gon saves Jar-Jar from the big tank right after he lands on Naboo, Jar-Jar's frame totally doesn't blend in to the background, and you can easily tell that he's not really there. Kind of similar to Jabba The Hut in Ep. 4 Special Edition when he talks with Han Solo.
d) The plot was no where to be found.
- Trust me, once u see episodes 2+3, the plot from ep. 1 will make a ton of more sense. If u don't want to know anything what will happen in ep. 2+3, I suggest you skip this part.
- Things like R2-D2 + C3PO having their memories eraced (remember in ep. 4 when they landed on tatooine and had no memory of the planet that they were on so often in Ep. 1? And Owen saying to Luke to have their memories eraced must point to that memory eracing is a common act in the universe), Obi-Wan's reasoning for keeping Anikan's existence hidden, Palpatine's reign of terror in the Imperial Senate, eventually destorying it and starting up The Galatic Empire, Anikan's struggles in training and temptations from the Dark Side + Palpatine, new apprentaces for Darth Sideous, Storm Troopers introduced in place of droids, and a ton more.
Note : All these plots movements have come from my own logical deduction. i'm with no way affiliated with anyone on the Star Wars projects, so these are not anything official, but they do make a lot of sense and give you something to look forward to.
e) Finally, too much happens by chance.
- I totally agree with you here, but for some reason maybe George thought it was neccessary to show how strong Anikan is with the force and doesn't realize it yet. Maybe showing he doesn't know his own strength and thus maybe shouldn't have been trained after all, or something like that. As for Jar-Jar's luck, I can't give any reasons for you there. But the film does get better every time you watch it and the luckiness doesn't really bother you after you get used to it. Expect a more mature and less funny Jar Jar in the next film thanks to his being general of the Gungan army.
Anyway, this is a great film, and a great prequel to start off the second trilogy. Can't wait for episode 2.",971740800,,3474,4.341538461538462
664668,5,6303454038,"Reading reviews of this movie, and how they seem to basically slam it, has promted me to reply.
This is a science fiction movie based on events that are in the mind of a single visionary, George Lucas. I have always thought that science fiction films were to entertain, but maybe I have a heart to much like a child.
The fact is, when Star Wars hit the screen in 1977, George Lucas invented the special effects used to make the movie. Looking at the film now, you can see how ""cheezy"" the effects are, but they still manage to entertain us and tell a story.
Episode 1 goes back to the special effects drawing board, breaking new barriers in digital film making. Does it look fake, well yes, but its pretty damn good. I often have to remind people that this is the beginning of the story, not a movie to compare with the first 3 movies released those many years ago.
Bottom line, this movie is so much fun, I cannot contain myself. I can do without Jar Jar, but hey, I cannot complain. Unless I can make a story better than Lucas, and provide the effects to bring it to life, I will just sit back and enjoy imagination at its best.",971654400,,1130,4.26046511627907
664669,4,6303454038,"The Phantom Menace, one of the most controversial, criticized and anticipated movie of all time. it's impossible for any filmmaker to recreat the success of his first movie, but despite some mediocre momments, George and his crew manage to make a pretty, good movie. Episode I is just as entertaining as the original, but the cast doesn't have that witty, chemistry that Luke and Co. had.
 However, the Duel of the fates fight scene with Darth Maul is excellent but interrupted by that Jar Jar. The podrace made Star wars haters show respect for the films. the sets, costumes,landscapes are beautiful. John Williams put alot of energy into the score. The story isn't that bad, needs more work on character developement though. For now I'd Accept the childish vibe that it has but i'd expect that ep 2 would be as mature as Anakin at 20. Since I'm a caribbean, Jar Jar was a bit offensive, but George won points with Sam Jackson as a Jedi and Capt. Panaka. Darth Maul, good villain but has nothing prove that he can be a match for Vader, except in a Duel. Qui-Gon is also a good character but has better cemistry with Watto than Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan doesn't mingle much with the rest of the cast or leaves Qui-Gon's shadow until the end.
I've been a fan since birth and I'm not very disappointed with this film. Yes, it could have been better, but after Matrix, It had some of the best Special FX than any other movie since Titanic so forget about Hollow Man! Still I wouldn't expect everyone to feel the same way about Menace.
This is a note 4 critics that dissed the podrace, for years movies has copied Star wars(ID4, wing commander, etc.) so what if the race reminds you of Ben Hur. The film did what it had to do- kick off The Saga and it did it! George, good luck wit' EP2!!!!!",971222400,6,1778,4.470769230769231

Sounded pretty good to me. But honestly, you have to admit that this film can't come close to Episodes IV, V or VI.  There is no innovation here, no magic. CG effects are not the answer. Go back to good old-fashioned scripting, editing, acting and melodrama. I hope the Force is with the next one.
As for the letterboxed VHS tape, it was pretty poor. The images were not clear or crisp at all. The quality of the tape itself was rather poor. There were quite a few dropout streaks. Very disappointing. Not a quality product. Bad showing all around. I just watched a letterboxed version of ""MOONRAKER"" on VHS. It was excellent. It almost looked as good as the DVD.

Comparable in quality to ""Return of the Jedi"", ""Menace"" lacks the charm and magic of the original three films.
The saving grace of ""Episode I"" is the highly inventive surrounding that Lucas puts these characters in.  Everything in Episode I looks different from the classic trilogy.  The worlds seem more populated and organized but it leaves you a bit unsatisfied.  There are highly complex action sequences which are a Star Wars staple.  But they would be more effective if we were given something more important to care about than a trade dispute on Naboo.
As for Anakin, I feel young Jake Lloyd did a competant job.  I feel it was a mistake to make Anakin an eight year old but that was Lucas' fault.  The film succeeds to entertain, but fails to offer anything new in the Star Wars saga.  The biggest slap in the face to fans of the series is Lucas' blatant disregard of the mystical Force.

If you don't understand that, then leave your negative comments to yourself. The only movie last year better than Episode I was ""The Matrix"".

664728,5,6303454038,"Didn't meet expectations, and it got five stars? Let me explain...
The Star Wars trilogy is just plain good viewing.  Sure, Return of the Jedi is a little weak, the 70s dialogue in Star Wars is hilariously outdated, but the movies are just plain good storytelling.  That's what it's all about - doing a simple thing well.  Few people try, fewer succeed.
Phantom Menace is again, a simple thing done well.  It is a story of happier times, before the Empire, when the Jedi were the Guardians of the galaxy. It is also a story of the of the rise of the Empire.  It's not obvious unless you know some of the story that didn't show up in the movies, so trust me here.
I remember the first time I saw Phantom Menace.  It was, of course, a midnight showing, and the theater went wild when the Star Wars logo appeared and the theme music started.  I, a generally mature 33 year old , was shushed by the teenager with his date sitting next to me, since I was so busy talking non-stop with my friends about the movie and every thing that appeared on the screen.  The movie wasn't that good.  It was just a Star Wars movie.  Of course, a Star Wars movie is better than about 99% of what's out there.
It didn't make me think, really. The special effects didn't leave me in awe. Jake Lloyd did annoy me.  So did Jar-jar.
It was just pure, unadulterated entertainment.
And the Jedi, at the peak of their power, did kick some major tail.  The fighting was out of this world.  You think Luke was a good Jedi.  Bah.",970185600,,1498,4.284697508896797

664730,5,6303454038,"This is episode I, meaning it relies heavily on the five later chapters to fill in the gaps. I know lots of people were confused by all that was happening and to be honest, there were more things going on than we're used to in Star Wars films. The writing, which came under the heaviest criticism, was very similar in tone and nature to the three previous films. The difference is that we were all younger and more forgiving of the simple innocence. It seems out of place in today's cynical atmosphere, but it's to his credit that he kept the tone similar to those that came before. He kept it 'all-ages' rather than marketing it to 13 year olds the way they did with the inferior Matrix. How easily grown-ups forget the way they saw the world as children. This film explores more than we're used to seeing and that can be confusing, especially to the unimaginative. All the 'disappointed' people seemed to be saying they wanted the same thing served up again rather than treading new ground. This galaxy is populated by a mix of aliens, droids and humans. As humans we tend to think of droids and aliens as puppets rather than characters. Again, this is a shortcoming of the audience. The ideas Lucas brings up are also not popular, this probably hurt the film the most. Greed is a terrible thing in Star Wars, but in America we swear by it. Naboo, a beautiful artistic is beyond the realm of Earthlings who litter their environment. The style of this film is beautiful and shows us that film can be art when crafted by visionary directors. The design, the photography, the palette and scope of the film are truly magnificent.  There are so many spectacular scenes, places, characters and events in this film, you must see them for yourself. The podrace, though exciting and stunning, is the only part that detracts from the flow of the story. There are so many strong points that more than make up for this. The lightsabre duel between the three warriors is fierce, magnificent and thankfully silent - most directors would fill such a sequence with pointless dialogue to enhance the adversarial relationship. The ground battle between droids and aliens is beautifully done and briefly returns us to the glory days of epic films.  When it comes down to it, who are we to say this is not OUR Star Wars? It is George Lucas' Star Wars, always has been and always will be. This chapter fits in to the whole, though we are two more films from realizing that. The Phantom Menace is most like Return of the Jedi in color scheme, mood and atmosphere and I think it'll be part of the story turning full circle.  For everyone who said it's 'not what I expected', try opening your mind and not limiting the film to the scope of your own personal vision, and don't make the opinions of others your own.

It's a total  farce that The Matrix STOLE the special effects oscar from The Phantom  Menace! The Matrix used special effects rampantly and just as filler for an  otherwise mediocre story, while The Phantom Menace actually used special  effects to tell a real story.

And please don't get me started about JarJar Binks.  But on the whole I was pleasantly surprised.  Casting Ewan Macgregor as a  young (old?) Obe Wan was brilliant, and Liaim Neeson made me believe that a  lone Jedi could actually defeat an entire solar system of evil entitties  with just a fancy sword.  I was, however, a bit troubled by the character  of Darth Maul.  His face was so prominent in the teaser posters that I  thought he'd have a much bigger role in the movie.  However, his duel with  Obe Wan and Liem Neeson at the end more than made up for the fact that he  wasn't in the movie much.  I liked it, but he simply and, I must say  unequivicalily, wasn't in the movie hardly at all, and this kind of  disturbed me, as the teaser posters led me to believe that his role would  be much bigger. But actually, his role in the movie was quite limited,  which perplexed me, as his prominence in the pre-advertisments had me  believing that this was to be a big player in the Star Wars universe  (omniverse).  Alas, this was not to be, as the character's role was much  smaller than I anticipated, which was a bit of a let down, as I felt the  ads emphisized the character of Darth Maul to be a major player in the  story, but it was not to be, as he turned out to be only a minor henchmen,  which seemed confusing as I was led to believe, through all the pre-release  hoopla, that this particular character was to be an important player in the  new movie, but it was not the case.  His role was quite diminished, and yet  his visage was quite large in the pre-hype publicity.  However, this turned  out to be all show and no go, as the character of Darth Maul was reduced to  that of a second rate supporting character, which was surprising given that  his face was the dominaant feature in the SWE1 advertising.  So, in the end  I found the movie to be quite sassifying, despite the fact that the  character of Darth Maul was conspicuously absent through out most of the  movie, which was unusual given his featured presence in the movie's  advertising.  He wasn't in it much.  I though he was going to be.  But he  wasn't.",968025600,,2379,4.302272727272728
664838,2,6303454038,"There are over one thousand reviews here, so I will weigh in briefly with these points:
A)  These environmental special effects are great for a  meditative interactive experience like the computer game Myst, but they are  overdone and confectionary here.
B) Some of the effects are carelessly  done and therefore distracting. The droid battle sequence appears as if an  SGI film sequencer had merely clicked his mouse (or whatever they use) 600  times to duplicate for an army the action sequence painstakingly created  for one battle droid.
C) The range of intriguing physical specimens of  this universe laid out for us in the original Star Wars' cantina has been  expanded by legions of cartoony mush-headed creatures  that render  pointless Lucas' attention to species nomenclature.
D) It is indeed  difficult to find child actors to fill roles that demand gravity and  dramatic range. For the role of Anakin Skywalker, Lucas needed to search  more carefully.
E) Of the gravity that Anakin should have had, the other  actors had an excess.  In fact, at no time in my recollection did any of  the characters have any dialogue that was incidental to the tense, rigid  plot line, as did Han Solo with just about everyone in the original.
Word is, Lucas is even more committed to special effects for Episode II  than he was for this one. You wonder why he doesn't just do a ""Toy  Story""-type animated film. If G.Lucas doesn't want to run this thing  completely into the ground, he would do well to listen, if not to the  faceless,clamoring public, then to a trusted friend, one with no vested  interest in his success, who might share some of those public opinions.",967939200,3,1665,4.846975088967971

Parts of the story are  too convenient, others too pointlessly silly, and other's too complicated  to care about. I never thought Lucas could make a movie worse then his  ""Howard the Duck"", but then Jar Jar came in and closed the coffin  on what once was a good filmaker. The only scenes in this piece of dung  that are watchable are the reruns of the first three: the race, the duel,  and the good guy blowing up the space station. NOTE: Whenever you have the  same ending THREE times in a FOUR movie set, you have got a heap of junk  that is only going to get worse. It's bad enough to see this movie, do not  make the mistake of buying it. This is, to me, the worst film ever made in  the history of our far, far away universe.",967852800,11,848,4.276729559748428
664840,2,6303454038,"Lucas has seemed to lost touch of the magical feel he created for the first series with the desire to ""outdue"" anyone and everyone with  technology and his ""crazy"" special effects team. If you read what  this movies plot (Huh?) is before seeing it you wonder if this movie would  have been gobbled up by a studio if the previous ones didn't exist to give  him some kind of credibility. Lucas needs to let someone else write and  direct as he is really only concerned with how many digitalized images he  can throw at your senses at once. Story was bad. Acting? worse; even the  special effects in some scenes just seem to be completely overdone and  computerized, where you sit and are reminded that there is a blue screen  behind the actors.  I own a DVD player but the video looks okay (I would  never buy it). I hope it never comes out for DVD. Who cares? That's  probably the biggest surprise a lot of viewers get from this movie. Who  cares about these people, places, or their futures? Lucas is also  re-releasing the original trilogy for the 18th time again in the near  future. This shows Lucas's state of mind trying to remind people that he  did actually make a good, fun, well executed series at one time and that  he's coming back to rob all the suckers who would buy it again, because  he's now more greedy than he is imaginative. For those who argue (like  Lucas did) that this movie is a ""setup"" for the next 2, that's an  excuse, copout, and an apology for making a bad movie. A trilogy is 3  movies that stand on their own, complete. Lucas said this because he knew  it was lacking and weak. That's like not doing your job for a week, and  when you get in trouble from the boss you tell them that you were  intentionally relaxing for the next week where you were really going to  ""pour it on, just wait and see"".  I also hope Spielberg stays  away from Lucas in his future projects. Lucas is as stale and boring as  ""his"" Episode 1 bomb. I'm sure the audio is descent but once  again who cares. More than reviewing the actual quality of the video, I  wanted to get these thoughts off my chest for Lucas wasting my time with  his experiments in digital buffoonery instead of actual substance. I hope  people are starting to get annoyed with these technology clowns taking  their audiences for idiots who require nothing more than flashing lights  and big budget blue screens to sucker them in.  The only thing worse is  ""Howard The Duck"". Why doesn't Lucas keep re-issueing that one?  Put him in front of a blue screen flying through space.

Dusty slept through the entire show without stiring.

664901,2,6303454038,"Let's not beat around the bush-- this was a bad movie. A very bad movie. It only makes things worse that this was the most anticipated film, well, ever. We waited 17 years and THIS is what we get?
Much was made of the fact that George Lucas hadn't directed a movie since Star Wars. It shows. If Lucas had been on the ball he would've fired the screenwriter, because the story and script are awful. Oh, that's right, Lucas wrote it, too. We begin to see the problem.
So what is The Phantom Menace about? Well, its about taxes. Its about a planet that doesn't want to pay what it thinks are too-high taxes. Now, this may be an acceptable subject for Bush and Gore to debate, but it seems an odd topic for Lucas to choose as the flashpoint for all that is to follow. Perhaps this is meant to be a civics lesson for the millions of politically uninvolved youngsters out there. Perhaps.
Anyway, it only takes about 3 minutes for the lightsabers to start waving around and no doubt the crowds went wild. Except that our fearless Jedi are fighting robots that are about as fearsome as a bunch of Furbies. Outnumbered 10 million to one our fearless Jedi make it to the planet's surface (exactly how is blessedly glossed over) and there Liam Neeson runs, literally, into one Jar Jar Binks. It is one of the momentous meetings in film history. Star Wars, perhaps the most revered (and profitable) story in the history of human creation is up against a character with the power to destroy it all. Like Lucifer himself, Jar Jar is an unholy creature. His pathetic attempts at comic relief, his unintelligable speech, the fact that a great actor like Neeson was forced to emote at empty air and then watched as it was filled by this abomination...it's beyond my abilities to describe how awful it all is. Did no one have the courage, the decency, to tell Lucas that this character was a horrible mistake? Cowards, all.
The other mind-blowing gaff Lucas makes is how he pretty much abandons what the whole Star Wars universe is based on, namely, the Force. If I recall correctly, Sir Alec Guinness describes the Force as a kind of New Agey cosmic energy emitted by all living things, a power that could be harnessed by those with the skill, training, wisdom, and patience to master it. Well, in this movie we find out the Force is actually a blood infection. The two Jedi analyze Anakin's blood & find out that he has a high level of this microbes or something and that's why he's so good with the Force. How on earth the people closely associated with Star Wars let Lucas screw up the Force is beyond me. It's insane.
The story itself is pretty blah. The pod race was neat and two laps too long. The assault on the Naboo fortress was about as exciting as preseason NFL game and ridiculous to boot. The kid who plays Anakin is annoying, as almost all child actors are. When he finds himself trapped on an enemy battleship and surrounded by murderous killer droids, Anakin utters the memoroable line, ""This is NOT good."" Ah, such scintillating dialogue.
Even the special effects are just kind of, ehhh. When ""Star Wars"" came out it was such a colossal hit because the special effects were light-years ahead of everything else. The opening scene, where the Star Destroyer is chasing Princess Leia's ship, was awesome, and I don't mean ""cool"", I mean awe-inspiring. Incredible. Today, digital technology (much of it pioneered by Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic) have made special effects, well, less special. Pretty soon any filmmaker will have the ability to hire a couple of high school kids with Macintoshes who can put together digital effects that can do anything. The director will wish it, and POOF! It'll be on the screen. Films will no longer be differentiated by the neato effects, but on such forgotten elements as the director's vision, good acting, great scripts, and interesting stories. All of which were sadly lacking in The Phantom Menace",967507200,8,3941,4.639484978540772
664902,3,6303454038,"While the original Star Wars series wasn't a revelation in story-telling (It was a little too soap opera-ey), it had many things that people  identified with.  They liked the ""scruffy"" rogue, the country boy  who does good, the elegant and feisty princess and the comic relief.
Lucas takes parts of his first trilogy and stuffs it to make the Phantom  Menace.  The space battle is a pale comparison to the ""star war""  in ROTJ, the pod race seems just like the forest chases in ROTJ, the  dirtiness and the hopelessness of Tatooine takes place again like it did  first Star Wars: A New Hope.
Having robbed his first trilogy for ideas,  he creates bland characters.  Other than Qui-Gon Jinn and Princess Amidala,  the others feel awkward in their roles.  The worst of course is Jar-Jar who  only purpose is to do cute things (such as bump into things, get in trouble  and do cutsy spirals before jumping into water).  The unfortunate thing is  that Jar-Jar will return in the next movie (Lucas, try listening to your  fans instead of your marketing group).
The story revolves around the  Trade Federation, an organization that has political aspirations.  It has  created a blockade around the small planet of Naboo and the Supreme  Chancellor has sent two Jedi Knights to take care of the situation.  Lord  Sidious, who is sick and tired of waiting around tells his underlings to  begin the invasion of Naboo (for what purpose, I don't know).  So faster  than the Iraqis left Kuwait, Naboo is taken over and occupied by Federation  Idiot Droids that seem to say ""Roger Roger"" over and over  again.
The princess, the jedi and silly Binks escape to warn the Republic  senate but lose their Hyperdrive and land in Naboo for repairs.  There they  meet Anakin and his mother.  While it is his mother's destiny to be a slave  forever (?), Anakin's is to be a jedi knight, because of the kaka that Jedi  Jinn has made up (sorry...Lucas took a fatal step with this mitichlorian  mumbo jumbo) and the fact that Shmi won't admit to who the father is. Lord  Sidious sends the devil himself, but Satan (called Darth Maul here) has  forgotton to wear his sandals and the good guys get away.
So after being  sidetracked with an irrelevant pod-race, the mission continues and they  reach the magnificent planet of Coruscant to persuade the Senators that the  Trade Federation are actually bad people.  After Chancellor Vellorum proves  that he should have acted like Wilson from ""the Limey"", not  Pricilla Queen of the Desert, he is ousted and Princess Amidala pushes  Senator Palpatine (in a big conflict of interest) as the new Supreme  Chalupa...sorry Chancellor.  So with the politicking all done, the  ""rebels"" go back to Naboo to turn some droids into end tables.  Problem is, they have no army.  Enter the Gungans, who are basically like a  third cousin from the backwoods of Arkansas.  Their king (who looks like a  refugee from Mardi Gras) gets fooled into helping the people that like to  look down on them, so the war begins and Gungans are the front line.  Of  course, don't expect the Naboo (whose planet is named after them) to do  anything but supervise.
I won't give away the ending but I'm sure that  anyone reading this already knows what is going to happen.  So why am I  giving this 3 stars instead of the 1 it deserves?  Because Lucas is a  marketing genius and has turned by mind into goo.  He already has me trying  to pre-order tickets for the next Star Wars coming out with a wave of his  hand.  I am and will always be a Star Wars slave....I just wish George  Lucas would make the pain of seeing Jar Jar Binks a little more  bearable....Rating: C+",967507200,6,3656,4.644654088050315
664903,3,6303454038,"The debate rages on -- the movie was awful, the movie was great, it was better than Jedi, it was worse than Jedi, it's too childish, it's too  commercial -- whatever.  Personally, I believe the first trilogy were  children's movies as well, but that fact was disguised by the absence of  children as characters and revealed with young Anakin.  Complaining that  this incarnation lacks the depth of the originals is like complaining that  the Power Rangers aren't as deep as the Ninja Turtles were.  These movies  are eye-candy and escape, and Episode I doesn't disappoint in either  category.
The reason for the three stars is Lucas' mercenary  merchandising.  Thirty dollars is too much to pay for a VHS tape, even if  it has a little booklet with it.  C'mon Lucas, give the people what they  want: A two-disc DVD with deleted scenes, director's commentary, and an  option to digitally remove Jar-Jar.",967507200,,902,4.874172185430464

The box is nice, the film cel is a cool added touch and the Art of Phantom Menace preview book makes buying this package well worth the price. Very good marketing strategy, Lucasfilm!
About the film itself, George Lucas definitely seems to be putting kids first in the Star Wars series, and it all started with Return of the Jedi (which is still better than Phantom Menace). He went from the darkest, most intense film, The Empire Strikes Back, to the most corny (belching, Tarzan yells, etc...), uninspired film of the original series, R.O.T.J. The trend continues in The Phantom Menace.
People are very mixed over Jar Jar binks. Some hate him... and some will defend him until they're blue in the face.  ...I thought Chewie doing the Tarzan yell in Jedi was bad enough, but this is even worse!
Alright, enough about Jar Jar. The special effects, of course, are amazing. In fact, the pod-racing scenes are reason enough to buy this movie. Simply jaw-dropping! The space battles are great as usual and the backdrops of Naboo are absolutely beautiful! They also did a very nice job with the skeletal C3-PO.
As for the acting, it is well done. Everyone does an admirable job, including Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine and Darth Sidious and young Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker. Plus, the intriguing Darth Maul had one of the best entrances I've ever seen! ...Awesome! The only thing that mars the performances is that the dialog is pretty dry, but I'm sure the next film will expand on what was said in this one. I also hope that, like Empire, the second film of this series will be much darker.
All in all, this is a very enjoyable film. ...With a cool package of goodies and at this price, how can you afford not to buy this movie?  END",967420800,3,1858,4.627272727272727
664905,1,6303454038,"The only thing I can say about Star Wars, Episode 1 is ""What happened?""  I finally gave in and used a free rental to see the movie  and was shocked at how a film so awful made so much money.  The acting was  terrible, the special effects average (too many computer generated images)  and the plot lacking emotion and substance.  Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman  and Ewan McGregor sleepwalk through their roles and Jake Lloyd shows how  one individual can single handedly ruin a franchise.
To make matters  worse, the script is full of dumb plot twists and bad dialogue that weighs  down the movie and neglects to provide any depth to the characters.  The  climactic battle between the Jedi's and Darth Maul is too short and wastes  the use of a great villain.
The one positive thing about the movie is  that we won't have to see Jake Lloyd in any future roles.  Too bad we can't  say this about the other actors.
Keeping with the tradition of present  day Hollywood, Episode 1 is another example of a film that uses special  effects to disguise a weak plot and sub par acting.

The storyline seems immature and childish.  The true  potential of many characters including Darth Maul and Qui Gonn are not  explored to any acceptable potential.  What saves the film from being  truly terrible is its breathtaking cinematography, computer generated  landscapes and the fabulous lightsabre duel between 2 Light Jedis and a  Sith Lord (that unfortunately is chopped with intermissions of Jar Jar  trying to be funny).  Using George Lucas's own words, ""special  effects without a good storyline is boring"".

However, it does answer many questions pertaining  to the series and it shows just how sweet Anakin Skywalker (AKA Darth  Vader) really was before he turned to the dark side.  It also answers many  questions about the Jedi, Imperials, and plot surrounding the first three.  The excellent acting and fight scenes were a major plus in the film, not  to mention the amazing visuals in the movie.  Most think Starwars Episode 1  was just a test to see what we could do, but that is just not true.  A  Starwars film has ALWAYS stived to be ahead of its time, no reason why this  shouldn't do the same.  With acting and story to the tops, there is no  reason why you should not buy this movie today. As with the package, you  get a nice little strip of the film negative and you get a nice book  featuring some cool concept art and cool designs/layouts of many places.  Also, you have a cool box with a great art picture of Theed in the  background, so it is a fringe benefit you could say.  The box series is  definatly suggested for Starwars fans; other people who just want to see  the movie, stick with just the movie.",965865600,,1788,4.3373860182370825

Surely the  producers could never have lived up to our ideals of what the new  generation of STAR WARS movies should be like; our ideals have been 20  years in the making.  George Lucas is an entertainer; and this movie was  down-right entertaining.  The effects were just aweseome; and the story  moved fast and furious, most of the time.  Do we really need to take a  whole movie to establish characterists of the people, when we already have  known them for 20 years?  This is a time of trouble in the galaxy, as soon  as the opening credits roll, and the characters are on a mission to avert  takeover by the Trade Federation.  Over 2 hours of bouncing around the  Galaxy ensued, and during that time we were entertained by the God of STAR  WARS.  There are at least 2 more movies to be made, and I expect to be  treated to over 4 more hours of great entertainment...this movie opens the  groove for the new trilogy...the original STAR WARS movie (now called  Episode 4) was ridiculed for having a dumb story...and now it's beloved.  Probably things will happen that way for this movie too, in time.

Watch the movie and you'll see that this  is as equal to the other three.  The story line in this is just as great as  the other three but it might take a little time getting used to the  characters.  I recommend that you watch the original three then watch this  one you'll get answers to questions you didn't know about, I guarentee it.  If you haven't seen the other three you might not like this but i doubt  that.  This movie has it all action, adventure, comedy, romance and even  some elemants of horror.  If you don't think it does have horror try to  think what it would be like if people who will soon become the empire  invade your planet... it would be horrifying.  Star Wars The Phantom Menace  has what the Return of the Jedi had: a battle on the ground, a battle in  space and a lightsaber battle.  Now that lightsaber fight was beautifully  planned out, if you didn't like that fight your crazy.  Now go on and rent  it, watch it again or buy it and you'll be pleased.

665054,5,6303454038,I disagree with alot of the negative reviews of this movie. I didn't think it was that bad! I do agree that it lacks from the original star wars. And  they put a alot more into special effects than into characterizations. But  those special effects are excellent. Oscar nominated Liam Neeson was.t that  bad nor his co star but i admit that Little Annakin was pretty bad. And I  DO AGREE that ja ja binks should be dragged out into the road and shot...to  ity bity pieces than fed to birds. That was how bad he was. I really wish  that the film and the original three were available on dvd special  editions...now that would be the ultimate star wars experience! Dont let  some of these reviews give your hopes up. The movie is still high ranking  in the movies that were released that year and better than some of that  other garbage.,965520000,,835,4.398692810457517
665055,2,6303454038,"This movie gets two stars, instead of one, only because it is the backdrop to one of the biggest and most popular cinematic phenomena in recent  memory, and it does leave me curious about what is to come. What causes  Anakin, who is such a caring soul, to go so bad? How does the Emperor  manage to eliminate a galactic democracy in exchange for his dictatorship?  How did all the Jedis die out?
And, of course, the ending saber fight was  incredible. Darth Maul would destroy Luke Skywalker.
Otherwise, Lucas  created the whole film with the idea of $2.99 action figures available at  K-Mart. Jar-Jar Binks serves absolutely no purpose in the entire movie,  except to be stupid. C-3P0 was a little corny, but at least his humor was a  little classy. All Jar-Jar ever did was drop things and trip a lot, and  annoy the heck out of 95 percent of the audience.
The heavily lauded pod  race, the supposed special effects showcase, was about the biggest waste of  screen time I've ever seen. Yes, it was fun to watch, but we didn't need a  half hour of film to tell us that, surprise! Anakin IS a good pilot. Real  shocker there. Plus, because there were three laps, the last two became  fairly predictable.
And the ending! I don't know how the Trade Federation  even managed a blockade, because Anakin broke through their defenses by  bumbling around and ACCIDENTALLY flying into and shooting up the most  vulnerable section of the Trade Federation's flagship.
I shouldn't even  mention the ground battle, where the Gunguns are outnumbered and don't even  have GUNS, yet not a single one of them is killed. After the victory,  nothing but droids lie on the ground. Come on, George, at least you killed  one of the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi, and they had the benefit of  surprise attack.
If you don't care about the Star Wars series, make sure  you skip this one. You'll undeservedly hate the whole thing even more if  you don't.",965520000,5,1927,4.597058823529411
665056,4,6303454038,Ok folks I have read dozens of reviews both good and bad and I fully  understand both points of view. I personally feel it was a very difficult  task indeed for Lucas to go back t the very beginning after such a layoff.  After making A New Hope I am sure he had no idea how he was going to finish  with Return Of The Jedi and then back in time to Episode1.  The  Phantom Menace could only go so far with it's direction and can only be  used as a point of reference. This move did exactly what it was intended to  do. It was to be the basic foundation to which the entire series is made.  After watching the next two movies I am sure many will find more  appreciation for the entire series.  My biggest complaint is the  exceptionally poor video quality. THX indeed? I have exercise tapes that  are of better quality.,965520000,,816,4.153846153846154

665058,3,6303454038,"I was expecting this movie to be a wonderful film, however I was quite  disappointed when I saw it. The plot and character development was the  worst I have seen in a movie of this anticipation. Jake Loyd, the young  actor who portrayed Anakin Skywalker, is certainly no Haley Joel Osment.  His acting was horribly monotonous. Liam Neeson must have been out of work  at the time when he made this movie. An actor of his stature should not  have made such a mediocre movie. The only good thing about this movie was  the crisp and clear special effects. Save your money.",965520000,4,568,4.509803921568627
665059,3,6303454038,"A year ago, I could not wait to see Episode I.  I did not once think that it could blow me away as Episode IV did as a young child.  I was simply  excited to see the saga continue.  A year later, I must say that the movie  was lacking in several respects, but set up the next two Episodes  nicely.
The storyline was intriguing but dragged in spots.  I can think  of two characters that bogged it down.  The first is the insufferable space  minstrel, Jar Jar Binks.  I have no doubt that Lucas intended any  characters to be offensive, but he was, and he added nothing to the story.  The second ""character"" was, simply, CGI.  There were too many  special effects, and not only were those effects overwhelming at times, but  they also reduced some of the human element that made the 1st three so  effective.  That being said, Episode I added political intrigue to the  saga, with the duplicitous Palpatine pulling all of the strings.  I also  thought that the movie did a good job of fleshing out more of the Jedi  philosophy, and demonstrating the level of skill the Jedi had, which was  only alluded to in Episodes IV-VI.
The cast, other than Binks, was  solid.  Liam Neeson is an ideal Jedi Master, and Ewan McGregor emulates  Guiness' Obi Wan Kenobi with youthful spirit.  Natalie Portman is stiff,  but has potential as Amidala/Padme.  I had hoped (even before Sixth Sense)  that Haley Joel Osment would land the role of young Anakin, and I regret  that he did not.  Jake Lloyd was earnest, but he was very stiff.  But the  most unforgettable character in this movie is the awesome Dark Lord of the  Sith, Darth Maul.  With only a few lines, and a show-stopping display of  physical dexterity and prowess, Ray Parks' Maul becomes one of the greatest  characters in the saga.  Samuel L. Jackson and Frank Oz's Yoda didn't have  enough to do.
All in all, the climax is formulaic by Lucas standards  (space battle-ground battle-saber duel.  And at times, the Jedi Council  seemed like a recalcitrant City Council (it was as if they said ""oh,  Qui-Gon, that Sith thing, we'll form a commission to look into it, but just  handle it the best that you can."") But the Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan/Maul saber  duel is undeniably the best action sequence in recent memory (the classic  Matrix sequences included).  However, I think the cinematography could have  been much better for all of the lightsaber duels, as many of the closeups  were either too short in duration or cut off a lot of the action.
In sum,  Episode I provides a very good segue for the next two Episodes, and I  anticipate that both will be outstanding.",965347200,,2605,4.588621444201313
665060,4,6303454038,"I believe that most fans of movies and Star Wars forgot the most important factor to watching this movie and that is that this is the First in the episode. I walked into the theatre with that understanding and acceptance,  not looking for it to 'out do' the others.  It was not supposed to. This is  was the beginning....
Anyone who expected more would be disappointed ... Granted, there were some actors that I  would have changed - however, in my opinion they were very minor roles and  the rest of the movie out weighted them and that is why I gave this movie a  4.
So give it a try with a different perspective.",965174400,,615,4.304347826086956

(2)Darth Maul was pretty worthless as the villain.  Other than  one incredible fight sequence he did nothing to impress.  (3)The pod race  that people seem to think is so great is straight out of Ben Hur.  (4)That  Jar-Jar Binks annoyed me throughout the movie and apparently will be around  for the next one.  That should keep me away from there!  I wouldn't give  this one any stars at all if it weren't for the special effects which are  very well done.  But I don't watch movies for special effects.  I watch  them for entertainment.  And this one mostly just annoys.",965001600,6,732,4.492307692307692
665122,1,6303454038,"George Lucas had years and years to make Episode I of the Star Wars saga, and this is what we get? One thing is for sure, it's obvious he hasn't directed a movie in 22 years. In this dry-toast re-working of the Arthurian  legend, the Republic is in a Newt Gingrich type deadlock as the film opens  with a 'trade-war' that is instigated by the Trade Federation: The IRS in  outer space. The Federation is about to attack the planet Naboo which is  ruled by a child i.e. Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman). Two Jedi Knights,  Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) are sent by the Republic  in an attempt to prevent the Federation from attacking the planet.
Needless to say, things don't go as planned and the Jedi escape to Naboo  where they run into Jar Jar Binks, an amphibious and obnoxious Naboo  'local' who is almost indecipherable. Together they 'rescue' the Queen from  the Federation's CGI battle droids and flee the planet. They then go to  Tatooine, the soul of the Star Wars saga, and things start to get  theosophical. They discover Shmi Skywalker (Pernilla August) and her young  son Anakin (Jake Loyd). And what do you know, Anakin was born without a  father. Qui-Gon is soon convinced this young boy is 'the chosen one' (think  the Matrix, Dune, the Bible) as he finds out young Anakin is 'genetically'  endowed with the Force to a very high degree. The film then gets to its  high point: The Pod Race. A Turbocharged rip-off of Ben Hur.
After the  Pod Race, they leave Tatooine and head on over to the capital planet of the  Republic. Here the film gets tied down in political talk so dull and  uninteresting, you think you're watching C-SPAN. We also find out that the  Jedi council is a boring bureaucratic committee (even Yoda is boring).
Problems abound with this movie. The CGI characters and backgrounds are  so overwhelming, there is almost a sence of dislocation. It makes you miss  the cheap, but organic, backdrops of the old sci-fi classics. And the  characters, who are they? Who is Qui-Gon? What's his past? What do Qui-Gon  and Obi-Wan talk about when they aren't narrating the films over-wrought  plot? Because there is no connection to any of the characters, it really  doesn't matter if they get killed or not. Everyone is a wooden prop. R2-D2  and C-3PO have nothing to do. Darth Maul is only a standard issue villian.
The fact that The Phantom Menace is only a 'table setter' for the next  two episodes is no excuse for the lifeless approach Lucas took with this  movie. I just hope he learns from his mistakes.",964656000,12,2554,4.651006711409396

I wasn't like these geeks who expected the greatest thing since slice bread, but I did expect a good piece of work. The movie was a letdown in almost  all aspects. The story resembeled Christianity a little too much. Young  Darth, the ""chosen one"", and his angelic Mary-ish mother, just  too much! Anakin(I know spelled wrong!), was a little too talented. I know  he is supposed to be this great warrior, but it's never cool to see a  smart-ass little kid. And Jar-Jar was, well you know. The effects were good  but not great, the droid fight was too fake looking. I guess the only true  bright spot were the fighting scenes.

665126,2,6303454038,"Overhyped, yes.  The movie is an epic, with some amazing special effects, and some great salutes to the Star Wars world we all know and love.  I actually enjoyed the movie and will buy it when it gets on DVD - it is  entertaining, but the below faults are what keeps this movie from being the  best ever - which, unfortunately, it could have been with a little more  forethought and direction (sorry George - the rust is way too apparant).
1) Underdeveloped characters - made 2 dimmensional for kids, little  development for adults, cookie-cutter and expected, creates little to  identify with and care about.  This immediately makes the movie  ""worse"" than the other 3.  Characters of Liam Neeson, Samuel L,  Jake Llloyd, Natalie Portman as the slave girl.  Caring or loving them is  very, very tough!
2) The Force as chemicals and science - totally takes  the fantasy out of Star Wars, which was always a blend of Sci-Fi and  Fantasy.  No more is it magical Jedi knights, but Hi-tech blood enhanced  combatants.
3) Jesus Skywalker - he can be chosen, just don't make him  immaculately conceived, that is just stupid and lame, and I think it has  been done before.
4) Calling him Ani - everytime it was done it made me  cringe...the kid is way too happy go lucky for being a slave on Tatooine,  and does nothing to further his destiny - a slave who can build his own  droids, has his own place with his Mom, and he can build pod racers?  I  never got the sense that this life was oh so hard!  Just as much lack of  acting talent as movie direction.  Also, what is the deal with all of  ""Ani's"" little friends - since when do Slaves get to hang out and  play ball and build pod racers and act so happy?  The Greedo kid played by  Willow man also really looked bad and out of proportion.
5) Making light  of war with the Gungans and Droids - no real drama.  The droids were  dramatic when they came in, then the battle turned into some sort of  animated joke - even the Ewok battle almost brought tears to your eyes when  you realized they were dying and little babies would be motherless or  fatherless - it made the war real and you actually cared for a bit.
6)  The horrible ""World War II Japanese"" English accents on the Trade  Federation leaders.  Especially being the first real dialogue in the film  it made me cringe from the get-go.  I was half expecting them to be  planning another Pearl Harbor bombing - as someone mentioned, give them  their own language and use sub-titles like Greedo.  But alas, that would  cut down on George's audience of kids who can't read, and wouldn't George  hate to let those kids down instead of every person over 12.
7) Jake  Lloyd - too stiff, bad actor, no intensity or drama in him.  It was like he  liked being a slave and he seemed really fake - horrible choice,  especially, as people said, the ""I see dead people"" boy was  available.  Don't see how he turns into Darth Vader - Lucas does very  little to further that to the audience in Lloyd.
8) Appealing to kids  directly and not even to adults.  Bad mistake.  Star Wars has always been a  young persons movie -but the genuis was that it truly did appeal to adults,  in rich drama, fantasy, and loveable characters.
I hate that this movie or the  others is not out on DVD - that just shows how much of a money grubber and  teaser Lucas is.  For all the 11 faults, I still liked the movie, found it  very entertaining and an epic.  If at least some of the above things were  changed or improved I know everyone would have liked it more (even those  who give it 5 stars) and if all of them were done, I know it would have  went down as the best movie ever.",964137600,5,3654,4.339285714285714
665127,4,6303454038,"Well...here i am, typing away to you, the reader...someone I will probably never meet...hoping that maybe my comments will affect the way you look at  this movie. It's a good movie.  I have it on VHS and have watched it  several times....and it is proving to be a ""true"" Star Wars movie  in that I can watch it over and over.  Sure, at my first viewing in the  theaters, I was disapointed...the digital animation seemed to take away  from the lifelike appearance of the aliens in the original Star  Wars...there is something to be said of a gritty looking alien as opposed  to the free flowing, polished look of the characters here.  I was also a  little miffed at Jar Jar Binks.  Now, I am a bit more accepting of his  presence, but I hope that he will be a limited creature in the next  feature.(HA! ) More criticism:  Darth Maul was no doubt tough as  nails...but, TOO much make up...too evil looking on purpose...lacked a  taste of vilian reality...my real complaint here is in comparing him to  darth Vader...Darth Vader had a political and intellectual presence that  Darth Maul never attains...mainly because he rarely speaks in this  movie...no dialouge or arrogent ""I'm going to mop up the floor with  you"" type discourses that you would expect from his pointy headed  appearance.  However, watching him dance the dance of light sabers with TWO  jedi's is wonderful...he puts on quite a show. Next realm of critisicm:  The trade federation aliens were absolutely horrible...is that a racial  stereotype i see in there?
So, why did i give this four stars?  It's  still a good movie.  It's still fun to watch and it gives insight into the  beloved Star Wars universe...Like many, I am a tough to please fan of the  original.  My ultimate complaint is that Harrison Ford isn't in the movie  as Han Solo...even though I know that would have been impossible...he's  still my favorite character.",964137600,,1898,4.7384615384615385
665128,1,6303454038,"So I buy this video because it looks pretty awesome, right? I never got to see this movie in the theater because I was in the hospital last summer with a broken back and eight cracked ribs after a little car accident that  was probably my fault even though I don't remember anything leading up to  it. Anyway, long story short: I never got to see this ballyhoo-boo-boo when  it was out in the theaters. Now, I'm a big fans of the ""Star  Wars"" series (the movies, not the books - only mad freaks who don't  get any play read those wack paperbacks), so I was pretty depressed, laid  up in the hospital, reading ""Death on the Installment Plan"" for  the umpteenth time, knowing that there was a whole nation of movie-goers  out there who were getting to see ""Star Wars: The Phantom  Menace,"" and that I wasn't one of them. Boy, should I have been  worrying about something else. When I finally buy the video, thinking it'll  be one of those movies that I watch over and over again - like ""Star  Wars,"" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""Return of the  Jedi,"" and ""The Ewok Adventure"" - I discover that this movie  stinks BIG TIME! I'm watching it, it starts out pretty good, with Obi-Wan  Kenobi (looking like he's really pulled himself together since Darth Vader  greased him in the first movie) and some other Jedi dude who looks like  Oskar Schindler running around this space station fighting rolling robots  with laser guns and out-crafting some evil Asian businessmen who've made  some pretty weird fashion choices, if you ask me. Anyway, I already have no  idea what's going on, but at least there's some action, right? However, 20  minutes down the line and I'm scratching my head and saying ""What?  This ain't 'Star Wars!' What is this? It said 'Star Wars' on the box, but  this ain't 'Star Wars,' no way no how!"" I don't know what else to say.  That's about the long and the short of it. Even though this weird movie has  ""Star Wars"" in its title, it's not a ""Star Wars"" movie  by any stretch of the imagination. That pretty little girl from ""The  Professional"" is in it, but I couldn't figure out it she was playing  one character or two. Doesn't matter. She looks hot either way. There's  also some tall freaky gay guy with a weird face and floppy ears. Also, the  little blond kid from that Smuckers commercial plays Jesus Christ or  somebody. The Devil is in it, too. I figured that the Devil would fight  that little Jesus kid, but he ended up fighting Obi-Wan and the other Jedi  guy, so maybe they're saving the fight between the Devil and the Jesus kid  for another movie. That ""Shaft"" guy is in it, too. The new Shaft,  not the old one. If the old Shaft is in this movie I didn't see him.  Anyway, I found this movie pretty confusing, to tell the truth. I really  didn't understand anything that happened in it. I don't know why Yoda  stooped to appearing in this film, either. I thought he was loyal to the  ""Star Wars"" franchise, but I guess he's just in it for the money  like every other Jedi nowadays.",964051200,13,3014,4.4387568555758685

The last time you watched Star Wars IV, did you watch Empire and Jedi soon after that?  Since  we can't see the other two films of this trilogy, all we can do is assume  what's going to happen: Palpatine's rise to Emporer, the Clone Wars, the  marraige of Anakin and Padm&eacute;, Anakin's fall to the dark side, and the birth  of Luke and Leia.  Aside from what we know of the story, we can't truly see  the spirit until the entire trilogy is released (probably 2005 or 2006) and  we can watch them all together, as a trilogy.  I still like Jedi the most  out of the trilogy, then Phantom Menace, then A New Hope.  I liked Empire  the least.  If you're a Star Wars fan at all, I think you'll enjoy it.  It  just didn't live up to all the media hype.
Now, a trilogy of the story  after Jedi would be good; The Truce at Bakura (a book), Grand Admiral  Thrawn in the Heir to the Empire trilogy (by Tim Zahn), and the Jedi  Acadamy Trilogy.  They should make those into movies.  Maybe by 2010.",963964800,,1120,4.183962264150943

I have  to admit that SW E-1 (whose German title would translate into ""The  Dark Threat"" by the way) doesn't spread the same, well,  ""magic"" of the other episodes, but it still remains a good piece  of family entertainment. Kids here loved that clumpsy Jar Jar guy (a weird  mixture of Indiana Jones and Inspector Clouseau if you ask me) or that  two-headed alien from the pod race, whereas older people remembered the  time THEIR fathers saw SW E-4 with them. At the bottom line, The Phantom  Menace stays a space-based fairy tale with all the necessary ingredients:  Good knights, evil sorcerers, nice and not-so-nice monsters, a beautiful  princess in distress and the certainty that there will be a happy  end.
P.S.: The only thing that angers me is the fact that there is no DVD  version of this movie, as I would like to see the US-version, too.",963964800,,1066,4.702702702702703

Like I said I love star wars, but it's like fans  all over the world have been brainwashed into believing that they are the  most important movies ever. How can any movie live up to expectations that  high?  The answer is it won't.  Episode 1 is a good movie that follows in  the spirit of the original. I'd write a review,  but would you care?

Problem is I didn't expect the same as the previous trilogy to live up to expectation's but felt despite the wonderful although tell-tale CGI effect's there's still something to be said for more organic looking FX however these were on a grander-scale the story itself is fine but somewhat hollow even though it's setting it up for another trilogy the beginning it fall's rather flat all the same. Naturally previous character's Yoda the droid's and Palpatine are great welcoming re-addition's but something sorely lack's with the newly-seen one's like Qui Gon,Amidala and the like that seem devoid of any personality let alone real character although young Obi Wan Kenobi IS VERY GOOD though Ewan McGregor coul'dve been given more than what was presented. Production values were high but even the music score doesn't compare to the other's in the series. Enjoyable for light-weight entertainment but lack's nesscesary dramatic-pull power and involement. Liked the new addition characters Watto,Sebulba and Anakin's mum Shmi Skywalker but agree with most some reviewrs that the casting of Anakin as played by Jake Lyod was an error now forever committed to celluloid. Liam Neeson, Nat Portman were fine, Jar Jar Bink's may have irritated many other's except small kid's but I found him to be more vulnerable,sympathetic and human than the human cast.  Rented this a few times since release on video liked it a little more but just not-enough  until the terriffic DVD release recently.

665213,4,6303454038,"Nearly every critic this side of the galaxy has bashed The Phantom Menace, saying that the characters are two dimensional and that Jar-Jar is a pain  to listen to. They say it lacks a good plot, and the dialouge is atrocious.  They say the characters have no real goals, and that the scenes in  Coruscant are boring. One of them even said the special effects aren't that  good!
DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM!  THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE SOMETHING AGAINST THE  GREATEST SCI-FI FRANCHISE IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND!
I'll admit that  the characters are flat in terms of personality, but I really don't care,  because it's Star Wars. Finally, the viewer gets to see at least some of  the beginning of the saga, with the rest coming in the next few years. I  heard that some people thought that Episode one was to bright and  cheerful... well, it has to be, because the next two are going to be VERY  dark, with the rise of the Empire and all that. Maybe we'll get lucky and  see Jar-Jar die in Episode two! Any way...
The special effects in episode  one are spectacular. Everything is just so detailed, from the tiny wires in  Quadrinaro's Pod racer to the way the trade federation deploys its battle  droids... your eyes will will lap it up! But Phantom isn't just visually  stunning, the audio aspects of the film are very impressive also. Every  single pod racer has its own unique engine sound, like the nascar blast of  Anikin's racer, or the raw powered diesel locomotive of Sebulba's. John  William's score is also of equal level. Many people complained because it  rarely had the original theme in the score, but I think it is better  without it. This is a movie that takes place decades before Episodes four,  five, and six, with no rebel alliance or evil empire. There is no Luke  Skywalker in a Death star, nor is there a certain ""piece of junk""  owned by a Han Solo. This isn't supposed to be like the original Starwars  that much, so a new theme is welcome...especially when it's as good as it  is.
But here's the flaws. The dialogue is bad. It's blank, unemotional  blather for the majority of the movie, and Anakin says ""Yippie""  to much. The characters are the same; blank, unemotional blather for the  majority of the movie. They have no concrete goals for them to follow.  that's probably why the middle part of the movie is boring to many people  (I find it entertaining, because it explains the government, and the  corruption within).
All things considered, I thoroughly enjoyed this  movie. Despite it's numerous flaws (most of them small and opinion based)  Star Wars Epiode 1- The Phantom Menace is one heck of a ride! Just make  sure you bring a blaster pistol along, just in case!",963792000,,2686,4.581052631578947

665272,1,6303454038,"I've just watched TPM again, and felt compelled to re-write my original review of it.
You see, when I saw ""Star Wars"" in 1977 as a kid,  I was hooked. I bought the soundtrack, posters, action figures, and models.  When ""Empire"" was released, I was a teen, but was still  enthralled by the characters and universe that Lucas had created. With  ""Jedi"", I felt that the tale had begun to really take on it's  epic mantle, even though I was now beginning to get a bit more mature in my  criticism of the plot holes, poor dialogue and one-dimensional characters.  With the release of ""Phantom Menace"", I can no longer even watch  the original ""Star Wars"" on video. And that is sad.
There have  always been irritants in the ""Star Wars"" series as annoying as a  gnat at a picnic: ""cute"" Jawas who capture R2 and C-3P0, comical  and ""cute"" robots, the hatefully demonically smurfoid  ""cute"" Ewoks, questionable acting, poor writing, and (except for  Billy-Dee's turn as Landau) a lily-white view of humanity in the future.  Any of these is bad enough, but the irritants and annoyances of the first  three movies have come to a head with PM.
First off is Jar-Jar (or Uncle  Jar, or Steppin Jar-Jar, or Tom-Tom). This poorly designed rastafarian  alien with the pseudo-patois accent and the barely hidden African American  phenotype is annoying at best, and downright offensive at worst. And for  anyone who is nave or blind enough to not see the obvious sambo  characterization let me enlighten you: dark skin, raggedy clothing, big  lips, a watermelon-eating grin, pale color on the palms of the hands and  soles of the feet, immediate subservience to the obvious masters, comic  relief and childlike behavior, and a shuffling gait. It does not matter if  the parallel was intentional or not, IT IS THERE. And when the final battle  is over what happens? The entire Jar-Jar species begins to savagely chant,  beat on drums, and dance like some ""mau-mau"" tribe in a bad  parody of a 1930's anthropological film strip about the ""dark  continent"" while the humans (who coincidentally happen to be white)  look on in paternalistic indulgence. You can almost hear the strains of  ""Mississippi Mud"" in the background. And that is sad.
Next,  comes the full-frontal assault on Asian culture. The traders who open the  film are little more than a throwback to old Hollywood portrayals of the  Chinese. The syrupy speech patterns with the drawn-out syllables, the  satiny gowns and headdresses, the expressionless ""inscrutable""  faces, and the effeminate manner.  These are all characteristic of the  propaganda and stereotyping of Asians that has long been disseminated, and  which is as offensive as portraying African Americans as shiftless buffoons  (aka Jar-Jar) or Latinos as theiving bandits who ""don't need no  steenkeeng badyez"".  Yet here it is, right in our faces! Not only  that, but after actual Asians are mocked in this way, Lucas goes on to  appropriate Japanese and Chinese culture, art, and philosophy, while  conveniently omitting actual Asians. You don't believe the Asian influence  is there?  Compare the costumes for Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul with  the attire seen in samurai films. Speaking of Maul, isn't it odd how his  face remarkably resembles a Kabuki-actor in devil make-up?  And what about  the names Qui-Gon & Obi-Wan? If you are still not convinced, just check  out the Queen Amidala outfit again. Finally, all you need is a brief  introduction to the philosophy of Shinto, Buddhism and Zen to see exactly  where Lucas stole the idea of the force from.  Now, old George has gone on  record as naming Akira Kurosawa as a major influence, but the overabundance  of Asian costumes, names and accents are beginning to border on a  psychopathic obsession.  Integrating elements of other cultures can be a  very effective tool, but using such ham-handed and ""orientalized""  Asiana in what is an ALIEN world can be seen as a dangerous and ethnically  tainted parallelism. Not only that, but to have so much overt Asian  influence without including any Asian actors begins to just feel funny --  especially since it IS a portrayal of an ALIEN world. This unintentionally  results in the only subtlety of the movie: That while we (read: white  people) may appreciate the culture of Asia, the total absence of any Asian  humans from the landscape suggests that they are fundamentally alien to us.  And that is sad.
As if all that wasn't enough, the writing in this movie  is, if possible, even more offensive than all the crude racial  characterizations. Overly clich&eacute;d dialogue infests the flick like a  bacterial infection, and the blatant ""borrowing"" from other  successful films is not only laughable, but indicative of a weak story.  Lucas should have just named this The BEN-HUR Menace and have been up front  about the whole thing! Not only that, but the whole Anakin/Jesus parallel  is ridiculous and delivered with the subtlety of a 10 pound sledgehammer to  the back of the head.
The only positive aspects of this movie were the  masterful special effects and the final battle between Darth Maul and  Qui-Gon. Unfortunately, these two elements were buried under an avalanche  of horrid writing, insipid acting, and ethnic caricatures bordering on  racist, leaving a movie only slightly better than ""Show Girls"".  The worst part is that so many people will refuse to acknowledge the  obvious shortcomings because of their blind allegiance to ""Star  Wars"", and that there will be yet another movie coming soon. And that  is sad.",963360000,9,5555,4.968375136314068

665275,2,6303454038,"This being about the 1000th review on SW-I, I guess everything's been said before. You either like the movie or you don't.
I enjoyed the SW universe from the moment I saw the first movie on screen as a 14 year old. Crazy  about the music, bought the videos, saw the new editions when they were  released three years ago. So yes - I am a fan, but I didn't expect to have  the reaction of excitement and awe I had as a kid. I mainly hoped for a  sentimental journey, which is exactly what I got.
Still, despite the pod  race, in the end this movie didn't do anything for me. I always felt that  SW-VI was the weakest of the first trilogy, and more or less expected  another let-down because many fans are crazy about SW-VI. (But come on, an  evil empire that terrorizes an entire galaxy gets defeated by a bunch of  teddy-bears? It is fantasy, but this really was a bit too much).
So why  didn't I like SW-I? It was not Binks, and forget about character  development and the early death of Darth Maul for a moment. It was the  complete absence of reality. Watching SW-I, I became painfully aware of how  boring a movie becomes when 75% of what you see on screen is computer  animated. It was like watching a cartoon. Impressively made, but  still.
So before die-hard fans fall all over me and start saying that I  just don't get it, a word of advice. Sit down one evening and watch Alien.  No computer animations, but giant sets with real people. It looks real  because it is. Watch The Abyss, shot entirely underwater. Now that's  impressive.
I wonder if the next two episodes, which must include the  clone wars and near extinction of Jedi knights, will feel like ""Disney  visits world war II"".
And I'm not holding my breath for a  second.

665357,2,6303454038,"As I'm sure you know, this movie is so extremely average that it is a mountainous blemish on the face of the Star Wars saga.  The standards George Lucas had to live up to for this project were immense, but this  movie is a letdown all the same.  The original three movie arc was a dark,  dramatic saga that was perfectly paced, beautifully written, and featured  strong, three dimensional characters.  Episode I, conversely, lacks the  dramatic edge that marked the previous efforts.  Instead of Chewbacca we  get Jar Jar Binks, an overgrown frog with an ugly pug of a face and a voice  that's about as soothing as a drill through the head.  Instead of a tightly  knit plot propelling the movie forward, the entire film feels like action  scenes with numbing drivel inbetween.  The importance of Anakin is somewhat  underscored.  He has ""special blood"" and can compete in pod  races, but that's the only look we get of his abilities.
The core  audience for these movies was established 23 years ago.  With this movie  Lucas is trying to appeal to the next generation, but he's supplying them  with inferior product.  Summation:  kill Jar Jar Binks, up the Darth Maul  factor times 10 to make it dark and edgey again, tighten up the plot *A  LOT*, cut out the circus/kiddy feel, and focus more on the characters who  will be in the forthcoming movies (not Subulba, not JJB, not those weird  looking Jedi dudes).

665358,2,6303454038,"Well, The Phantom Menace certainly has one thing going for it, it manages  to be a tad better than Return Of The Jedi. Unfortunatley, this isn't  saying alot since Return Of The Jedi was so terrible. Other than that The  Phantom Menace was a disappointment. Saturated in mind-numbing digital FX  that work most of the time, the exception being the Gungans, The Phantom  Menace is so crippled by characters with two dimensional personalities you  WILL find yourself missing Han Solo at some point. Though some have  rationalized this movies poor character development as symptomatic of a  childrens movie, I'm quick to point out that Disney's 'Mulan' had much  better character development than The Phantom Menace. The ""it's a kids  movie"" is no excuse. The film gives very little to digest beyond eye  candy. As such, when things slow down on Coruscant the film gets a little,  dare I say, dull. Even the 'Pod Race' was poorly executed as it failed to  put the viewer into the drivers seat. Sure, it was cool to watch but  completly devoid of suspense. Though the silly two headed announcer, who  looked like it could have stepped out of Return Of The Jedi, certainly did  not help.
Jake Loyd, as the nine year old Anakin Skywalker, looked  bored. Though I suspect this has more to do with the fact Lucas is no  actors director than to Loyd's ability. Ewan McGregor was wasted, but I'm  sure this is because he doesn't get to develop until Episode Two (I hope).  Liam Neeson actually brought some heart to this flick (quite a feat) as the  wise but head strong Qui Gon Jinn. Darth Maul, the most dynamic looking  character in all of Star Wars, was also wasted with only a few lines to  speak. And the 'Duel Of The Fates' sequence, the lightsaber duel in which  actor Ray Parks (Darth Maul) gets to showcase his martial arts skill, is  ruined by the constant break away to the other conflicts.
All in all,  this movie IS worth checking out due to some of the powerful visuals - But  there is little else you will take with you after you've seen it.

The thing that made the first Star Wars films great is that they are extremely well rounded and balanced,  and succeed in all of the areas. This movie attempted to recreate that  previous success, but didn't quite make it.
In this space-age tale,  Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jin (two jedis from the Jedi council, one of  which is already well known) try to end a trade dispute which has resulted  in a blockade going up around the planet known as ""Naboo"".  However, after an assassination attempt, they are forced to flee to Naboo,  where they meet some interesting people, including Princess Amidala (played  by Natalie Portman). From there they make a desperate attempt to visit a  political council on the faraway planet of Coruscant. On the way they stop  off on Tatooine and end up picking up Anakin Skywalker, a.k.a. Darth Vader.  He's much younger, though, and not at all menacing.
After the entire  party reaches Coruscant, they do some things (sorry, I'm low on big words  right now), and eventually decide to head back to save the planet (Naboo).  The movie has some good scenes towards the end, and the lightsaber duel is  awesome- it's like acrobatics with a little bloodthirst.
The reason this  movie doesn't quite make it is that the storyline is only marginally good,  the characters aren't developed enough, and frankly, Jar Jar Binks ends up  as one of those characters you just wish would be put out of their misery  with a sledge hammer... However, the movie does have great special effects,  and offers a look into Star Wars history. No, this movie is not as good an  achievment as the earlier movies in the series, but it is worth seeing.  And, though it's not a true epic, you probably will enjoy it.

The special effects were amazing, but the storyline was severely lacking. Of course, every Star Wars  fans knows this by now, as well as a good percentage of the rest of the  population.
The consolation here is that if you want to buy the movie,  you should buy the widescreen edition so you're not missing half the cast.  Of course, fans with enough patience can always wait until 2010 to buy the  DVD.",962236800,2,526,4.494736842105263
665397,1,6303454038,"Why is this a movie for an audience with a limited attentionspan?
This movie had one instance in particular that struck me asbeing cut so very short. The ""climactic"" battle scene with Darth Maul(who's personality was never developed) ended so abruptly that I was wondering why there was no dialogue between the villain and Obi Wan and Qui Gon(At least something might have helped). Do you remember the battle scenes from the original trilogy? Didn't they have an element of tension between the combatants that was slowly risen to a moment of importance? How about the duels between Obi Wan and Vader in Episode IV and the duels between Vader and Luke in Episodes V and VI? What about the drama? It was there and gone in a hurry in Episode I. Other scenes also seemed out of place. The scene with the big fish eating the smaller fish had no purpose. That was just ""eye candy"". The way Anakin accidently took out the ship really bothered me. It was an event of blind luck. Not a single bit of suspense or drama was present. It was yet another fleeting moment in Episode I.
Why does it lack humanity?
It lacks humanity for a number of reasons. One reason is the fact that none of the characters other than Jar Jar Binks had any personality. Jar Jar was basically a cartoon character so I wouldn't call that a ""human"" characteristic. He was just zany.  As for the other characters, could you actually describe what the characters might be like in the real world? I can't. Wasn't Han Solo a pirate who was lovable in his own selfish way? Wasn't Princess Leia a spoiled brat with a sharp tongue, yet lovable nonetheless? Wasn't Luke your typical high school kid full of hopes and dreams of the future?(All that based on Episode IV: A New Hope) The humanity was truly lost when ""The Force"" was described as being some sort of genetic inheritance. For me, that was totally 100% contradictory to the original trilogy. Wasn't ""The Force"" something that was said to surround and be present in all living things. The Phantom Menace took the humanity out of ""The Force"". It took the idea of faith leading to greater self fullfillment and shot it to hell. According to this new definition it was not present in all life. It was designated for a chosen few and predetermined. Ask yourself if at any time this movie made you feel genuinely sad(either empathetic or sympathetic) for any of the characters. Were there any moments of true laughter? Did you have any reason to truly hate the villain? Did you feel any emotion at all? Was the Phantom Menace any more than just a series of hollow events that led to a ""happy"" ending?  Please, think about that.",962236800,9,2638,4.575052854122622

665400,5,6303454038,"Ok, Ok, Ok..... you've heard all of the hype - you've seen the commercials - you've heard the critics, so nothing I state here could pursuade you either way, but I feel that as much as I have watched Episodes 4, 5 & 6  that I should throw in my 2 cents worth.
First of all, watching Episode 1  for the first time took a little adapting from the future episodes. George  Lucus had to start from the beginning, and so did we. Unfortunately, if you  are not a fan of the original trilogy, you will never truly feel the impact  of this episode in connection with the future of this series. For a  first-time Star Wars experience, it is a good movie, but won't make a lot  of sense.  Only seasoned Star Wars fans will understand the true  significance of this episode and how it relates to the original  trilogy.
Having seen the trilogy nearly 50 times each throughout my  teenage and adult life, I can truly appreciate Episode 1 for everything  that it is and for what it is setting up for episodes 2 & 3. And I  eagerly await episodes 2 & 3.
(Besides.... The Dual of the Fates is  BY FAR the best light saber dual in all the trilogy combined! )
I have a  feeling that Episode 2 (now in production - yipee! ) or perhaps Episode 3  may center around the era of the Clone Wars, mentioned in Episode 4.  Starwars.com says they will not have the official 'title' for Episode 2  until it is near completion. Who knows... it may be Episode 2: The Clone  Wars.
The bottom line.... this is by far one of the best Sci-Fi movies  you could have add to your collection. But if you're going to add this one,  you might as well add the Star Wars Trilogy to it as well.  Well done,  George Lucus!  I eagerly await Episodes 2 & 3.

665401,5,6303454038,"This is the first episode of the spectacular 'Star Wars' sega - before Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia were born; thirty years earlier.
Anakin Skywalker (a.k.a. the future Darth Vader from the Dark Side of the Force)  is a young slave boy living with his mother who is also a slave on a  different planet. When Anakin wins a pod race, he is set free by his master  to join a master Jedi Knight from the Good Side of the Force and his young  Jedi student, Obi-Wan Kenobi. The master Jedi Knight (Liam Nesson), Obi-Wan  Kenobi, and Anakin travel to a distant planet to help a young queen and her  people from suffering in an invation. Together, they try to stop the  invation by destroying the evil Darth Maul from the Dark Side of the  Force.
You'll notice some of your old favorite 'Star Wars' characters are  in this movie like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker. But then  you'll also meet some brand new characters like Jar Jar, Queen Amidala, and  Darth Maul. The acting and special effects are incredible! Some of today's  hottest stars are in this movie, too like Liam Nesson, Ewan McGregor,  Natalie Portman, Samuel L. Jackson, Jake Lloyd, and Frank Oz. And of  course, the brilliant music is composed and conducted by John  Williams.
George Lucas takes you on a fantasic, thrilling ride back into  the past way before the Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia generation -  before Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, when he was once good! If  you've seen episodes 4, 5, and 6, then you'll love episode 1! This movie  maybe long, but hey -weren't all of the 'Star Wars' movies long? This is a  movie you can watch again and again without getting bored - you'll remember  it for years to come!

While some people were waiting in lines weeks to get to see it and had prophecies of it being the best piece of film ever made, I  figured it could go either way.  The first thing I noticed from the  previews was that they seemed to rely heavily on the special effects, at  least as far as the sales pitch.  The previews were basically a collection  of the best eye-candy in the movie.  This observation still held true after  I saw it.  Think about the first 3 Star Wars movies and how little they  relied on special effects yet still created heavy doses of awe.  This movie  tends to rely too heavily on the special effects, which adds very little to  the movie and creates that horribly cliched ""Episode 1 was made for  little kids"" line.  What I don't understand when I hear someone say  this is why they think this is any different.  The original Star Wars  trilogy could have been just as easily entertaining to children as to  adults, a rare feat indeed.  There is so much I could say about the movie  but I will sum it up with saying this.  The movie is a good prequel but  that is it.  Imagine *just* watching A New Hope.  You had to see the other  2 to get the effect.  I'm sure when the other 2 are released in 2042 the  series will be just as enjoyable.  The lowpoint of the movie were the  characters.  Some were hatable (Jar Jar), others underdeveloped (Young  Anakin), some just there for old times sake adding nothing to the story  (Jabba), and others were inconsistent with the original (Qui-Gon).  The  highlight was Queen Amidala - well acted, memorable costume.  Maybe the  movie was made for Lucas' kid.  Maybe it was just another Hollywood ploy  because Lucas' bank account is running dry.  Whatever it may be, it's still  an average movie that does and will add something to this classic  storyline.",961545600,,1912,4.420289855072464

Okay, now try these also: this is not EMPIRE STRIKES BACK... Om... this is not RETURN OF THE  JEDI...
So many people have come to this movie with the most irrational  expectations imaginable, from the shameless marketing of the products  disappearing that is as synonymous with George Lucas as freakin' RONCO, to  it having a DUTY to outdo not just one of the greatest movies of its kind  of all time, but in the context of people who had not only seen it 128  times but have studied it as much as Lucas himself.  Why do this?  I knew  at the outset that nothing could ever possibly outdo the emotions of the  nine year old boy I was in 1977, who sat in a movie theater watching a  movie influenced by the mythological perspective of Joseph Campbell  unfolding with special effects that changed the course of movie history  forever. For starters, I'm not nine anymore; it's like comparing your  Grandmother's Thanksgiving day turkey when you were six to your wife's on  your first one together as a couple!
With that said, perhaps that's why I  enjoyed it so much more than so many others.  Not to say there weren't  holes in the plot, particularly around the evolution of the young Darth  Vader's relationship with the Jedi, and yes, Jajar Binks (sp?) was  annoying.  But the movie was so much fun, and all and all, once I released  the expectations of a fashionably cynical, oh so experienced adult, and  took on the open mindedness of MY son (who ironically enough, was nine  years old when I first took him), I enjoyed it immensely.  The story and  the entire anthology is well served.  the special effects are (what do you  expect?) dazzling.  It is worth owning.

This story is one big  adventure that is fast paced with more special effects than you can shake a  stick at.  Lucas definately put a lot of time into this as his attention to  detail is nothing short of incredible.  I have watched this 3 times now,  and have noticed something new each time I watch it.

Well, if you expect what you remembered as a kid, you're probably going to enjoy this film (my 40 year-old dad has watched this tape more than I  have!). If you expect a more mature Star Wars, you're going to be  disappointed.
This film is a pure graphical feast. I don't know how it  lost to the Matrix at the Oscars. There are so many stories behind the  story, so many things going on crammed into nearly every frame that its  impossible to take it all in in one viewing. And let me tell you, the  'saber battle at the end is one of the best fight scenes ever period!
I  feel that this film was made to introduce the new characters of this  trilogy. And it gets the job done, whether you love em (Qui-Gon) or hate em  (Jar Jar). But admittingly, the more I see this movie, the less I hate Jar  Jar. Sure he was VERY annoying at first, but after a few veiwings you can  actually understand what he is saying, which makes him a LITTLE less  annoying.
The only way to watch this video is by getting the widescreen  version. Sure it costs a bit more but its worth it. And the picture is  surprisingly good (especially the colour) for VHS. I can't wait to see what  they have in store for us with the DVD.

Star Wars was always meant as  high-octane, visually inventive eye candy whose job was to thrill,  entertain, and put you squarely in another universe, and ""The Phantom  Menace"" does no less.
With the caliber of actors who worked on the  movie, it could have been far more character-driven, but the film still  works as grand entertainment and a sturdy foundation to the new Star Wars  series.
""The Phantom Menace"" has scenes and set pieces that are  so lush, so beautifully conceived and constructed, that you literally ARE  transported to another world. The entire Naboo city, for example, is  absolutely fabulous - Venice set in another galaxy. Tatooine, though we've  been there before, is shown in much greater detail as a place where people  literally live in co-existence with a desert. The Gungan city is also  extraordinary, and gives us a sense that there's a serious intelligence  behind the laconic Gungans that later serves as an important plot  device.
The action sequences in ""The Phantom Menace"" are also  beautifully conceived and executed, particularly the podrace sequence,  which is absolutely thrilling. The various lightsaber battles are done  convincingly, and the battle on Naboo between the Gungans and the battle  droids - conceived almost entirely on computer - has true epic sweep.
So  if ""The Phantom Menace"" succeeds grandly as entertainment, why  only three stars? This is because its human factor - actors and characters  - fails it.
Right off the bat, the character of Anakin deserved a better  actor than Jake Lloyd. He's a cute kid, and displays some pluck, but he's  utterly unconvincing when it comes to scenes requiring emotional depth.  Other young kids have given their characters great depth and believability  (witness Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense""), and with Lucas'  unlimited budget and resources, it's surprising he made such a poor choice  to play Anakin.
By the end of the film, I had no idea whatsoever how this  kid could grow up to be Darth Vader. Perhaps that's Lucas' intent (it does  provide a powerful incentive to see ""Episode 2""), but it was  extremely unsatisfying dramatically.
With the acting talent on display  here - Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, for starters - George Lucas could  have made this film far deeper character-wise, but he didn't. It seems  those big names were chosen for their names, not for what they could do in  character. Even Samuel L. Jackson, who rarely seems to blend into anything,  seems bemused and bored in this film.
Acting woes aside, ""The  Phantom Menace"" does succeed grandly as entertainment and spectacle,  and is very much worth seeing.

665483,1,6303454038,"Like so many others I waited fingernail biting for many years. Also like many old fans I was left sorely disappointed.  Now I kept my expectations relatively low for the new movie-and still it was bad! (Really bad) Most of  my friends desperately wanting to keep Lucas venerated had ""it was  alright/ had some cool effects"" to say, only to later join my much  stronger ""I hated it"" stance.  I've heard plenty of negative  criticism without some specifics, so here are some of the problems with  Lucas' blunder as I see them:
-THE TARGET AUDIENCE: (it was kids!)  Now I  know the desire was to keep Star Wars available to all ages, but this  failed. The original movies were mature enough in dialogue, mood, and  detail to enthrall older ages, yet still accessible to younger ages (Darth  is evil). This movie though, is kept accessible to its target audience  while neglecting the majority of its fans.
-THE COMEDY: (cheap laughs and  clowning) In keeping with making a children's movie, Lucas had to ensure  that all of the comedy could be understood, therefore physical buffoonery  was the only out. Would it have been too much to include some subtle banter  (or any verbal comedy) like that found in the other movies? (and capable of  entertaining audiences older than twelve). Really though, does anything  more need be said than Jar-Jar? I don't think so.
-THE VIOLENCE: (can't  have the kids see any) Now not that I advocate violence for its own sake,  but in this film its a mix of clowning-robot breaking-safety. The first  five minutes of A New Hope are more violent then this entire movie- Vader  parading over the fallen bodies of the storm troopers and rebels (and this  was '77, not the desensitized world of the millennium). Violence can be  used as a tool to produce mood, enforce the gravity of a situation, or (as  Lucas likes) a chance to have a clown dance around making light of a 'war'  (I guess because we wouldn't want our target audience to become upset at  all the violence)
  -SELF-CONTAINED WORLD: (it was not) The movie has  placible accents (that are also painful) and connections with the 'real  world'- i.e. the steriotypical comentators during the pod race.
-THE  CHARACTERS: (because I care) The characters and their interactions are  boring and cardboard. The enemy is not built up at all. Sure old Mal looked  pretty nifty, but what is he? The villain- he dies- oh well, whatever, nice  and one sided (after all, the target audience will get it). The same  emotional impact is felt when Qui-Gon dies: ""oh  well"".
-UNBELIEVABILITY: (suspension of disbelief has  limits) Anakin is in his fighter plane, avoids dying, and accidentally  shoots what turns out to be integral to the station and thereby winning the  battle being 'fought' on the planet. I'm sorry I just couldn't work with  it.
-ANAKIN""S FOREIGN TOUNGUE: (why? why?) Petty, maybe. Integral to  the story, no. Annoying? Hell ya! Whose idea was it to have Anakin speak  his rhyming gibberish? Were they going for the 'hey this sounds made up'  sound, or the 'are they doing this on purpose?' sound?
I apologize for  not going into greater detail (because believe me, I could) but these are  some of the more prominent problems to a movie that I would plan to watch  again only to find all those faults that have been forgotten since seeing  during its first week.
My conclusion: Lucas has become drunk with success  and lost his mind.",960768000,60,3427,4.754684838160136

Another complaint  about him is that his dialect is supposedly racist.  I can see why people  thought this.  In Hollywood a while back black people were portrayed with a  similar dialect.  Thats because in the eyes of the racist white Hollywood  bigwigs black were of a lower inteligence.  Now when George Lucas was  devolping the Jar Jar Character he had to devolp dialoge which would show  the character being of lower inteligence.  As a resolt, the two dialects  turned out be similiar. If Lucas is being racist in this movie at all its  to the Gungan race.
2)Another complaint about it was that there wasn't  enought character development.  This would be true if this was a complete  story, on it's own, but it's not.  It's the first of a Trilogy.  Thats like  reading 1/3 of a book and complaining that the characters weren't developed  enough.  You have to read the whole book before you can decide that.
3.  The Plot is too confusing!  Thats the worst complaint i've ever heard.  If  you are unable to understand the plot of a movie thats rated PG then your  in troupble.  I can name about five 8 year olds right now who could give  you a plot sumarary, an analysis, and the foreshadowing involved.  And if  it was a little complecated I don't recall anybody whining about how  ""The Usual Suspects"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" were too  confusing.
Well I could go forever about all the other unfair nitpicks  that have fallen on to this movie from critics that don't have any sort of  imagination at all, but I won't because I think I've hit the big ones.  But  please send your nit picks about this movie to me and i'll answer you with  a logical explanation to why they are hollow.  I think this is a tactic  (the ability to think logically) which most critics should start using more  before they attack a movie....",960681600,4,2317,4.493946731234867
665555,5,6303454038,"I've seen a lot of negative reviews for this one. I don't know why either. Was Jar-Jar annoying? Yes, in some cases he was very annoying. Anyone else remember how annoying C3PO used to be? That didn't stop the first trilogy  from becoming classic. The action (especially the end lightsaber fight) is  spectacular. The special effects are also spectacular and blend very well  with the rest of the story. Over all, I think people just expected way to  much out of this movie and were dissappointed when it was merely just as  good as the other Star Wars movies.  I for one was very excited when I  first saw this movie. I was like a kid the night before Christmas when I  first saw Star Wars Episode 1 scrolling up the big screen. I was not  dissapointed.",960681600,6,754,4.445255474452555
665556,1,6303454038,"This film has been incredibly overhyped, and the factor that it being the most anticipated movie of all time, I thought that it could have had higher expectations.  There was two good scenes: Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul  fighting, and the pod race.  The pod race wasn't suspenseful, because you  know the annoying boy has to win.  I'm sorry, but it hurts to insult a kid,  but it seems OK with a movie like this. There is no bright points in this  movie, and the acting was not good.  All they did was whisper to each  other. And there was Jar-Jar.  He was just what he was supposed to be: A  childish, annoying, clumsy imbecile.  You got to hand it to him, he's a  better actor than Liam Neeson in this film.  The casting wasn't good.
Put  it this way: Jar Jar doesn't belong; Chewy does.  Qui-Gon doesn't belong,  Han does.  Anakin doesn't belong; Luke does, and, of course, the Cinna-Bun  hair-styled Princess Leia.  That's the Star Wars I like.
I am one who  thought the first 3 were really good, because there was the chemistry.  I  think that Lucas did this for the money and the hype and his extra 15 years  of fame.  Another funny thing is that it looks newer than the original, but  it's supposed to be before the original.
I do not recommend this movie.  If you want to see a good movie, see American Beauty, and if you don't  already know the ending, Sixth Sense, or...The Lion King, I guess.  OR THE  ORIGINALS AGAIN.",960681600,7,1434,4.403846153846154

Maybe in the hands of people like Lawrence  Kazden (who wrote the script for 'Empire'-the best of the orinal trilogy)  and Frank Darabont, we'll get some inspired film-making.  Something that  the Star Wars myth legacy deserves (even though the trilogy didn't deserve  'Jedi' either, but...).  But if it stays in Lucas' hands?...YEESH!  Do we really need ANOTHER ""VILLIAN TUMBLES DOWN A BOTTOMLESS  CHASM"" scene, or ANOTHER ""BIG-BAM-BOOM SPACE STATION"" scene,  or even ANOTHER ""CELEBRATION FINALE"" scene?  THere is no doubt,  to me anyways, that Mr. George is a great 'Idea Guy', and he used to be an  inspired all-around filmmaker.

665560,4,6303454038,"I wrote this review because I just couldn't take it anymore. So many folks are giving this movie bad ratings, and there is simply no basis for it. It seems like there is some kind of bad-review bandwagon out there and people  are hopping aboard without putting any thought into what this film was  actually about. I am a massive Star Wars fan, and I will admit that this  movie made me sneer at first. Then I realized a couple of things, such as  1) This movie was not made to personally entertain me or anyone else from  the original Star Wars generation; it was made for today's generation (our  children)  and 2) It is easy to forget that this movie is a PRE-quel to a  film made over 20 years ago! The original SW was criticized the exact same  way this film was (too many effects, bad story, weak script, blah blah  blah). This is also the beginning of a TRILOGY. People are saying that they  miss Darth Vader without realizing that we are watching that character's  creation, as well as the other events leading up to the older films. How  could any SW fan be disappointed by that?
No other film in history had as  much to live up to as this movie did, and no other film has been  scrutinized more. If the other Star Wars films didn't exist and this movie  was a fresh idea, it would have been an overwhelming success. The amount of  work and detail that went into this picture is a stunning achievement. If  you take away the amazing computer-generated effects, you are still left  with massive, intricate sets the size of small towns as well as costumes  and props that are so commonplace, it becomes easy to overlook the fact  that every last bit of it was taken from one man's imagination and brought  to life with exquisite detail. He did not wave a magic wand; he spent years  and years of his life working with hundreds of amazing people in order to  give folks like you and me a two hour escape from reality. Bottom Line: If  you want the same experience that the original Star Wars films gave you,  then watch THOSE. If you want to experience an amazing thrill ride of what  today's special effects have to offer, then watch Episode 1 (at least shut  up and get it for your Pokemon-drugged kids). Or, if story and plot is ALL  you care about (you boring snit), don't worry. Just stay put in front of  your 1977 classic - this new series will eventually catch up to the old  one.

I must say that the special effects and creature design are both very good, especially considering the sequence of the podrace in the Boonta Eve. Then  there's Ewan McGregor for the feminine audience to lust over, and Natalie  Portman for the males. While the young Annakin Skywalker proved himself to  be a good actor, I didn't like him, because he appeared to be too much of a  conceited little brat. Don't even get me started on JarJar Binks...five  consecutive minutes with him in a scene are enough to drive me crazy. I  felt like getting up and walking out of the room or fast-forwarding through  the scenes with him. He tries too much to be funny and doesn't succeed.

665622,5,6303454038,"Episode I met all of my expectations and then some. True, it is certainly not the original three films, but it's still very good. ""The Phantom Menace"" has a much more uplifting feel to it than the later three  movies, which is one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much. The people who  were expecting to experience the joy and amazement inherent when they saw  the original films will be disappointed, so if you're that closed minded, I  wouldn't suggest watching it.
I believe that most of the fans who think  that Lucas has sold out Star Wars as a kid's movie are completely wrong. In  essence, the original three were children's movies; that's not to say that  adults don't enjoy them, however. Lucas accomplished something very unique  in that he could construct a plot deep enough for adults, and yet simple  enough for children. The plot of episode I is not as deep as the three  original films, of course, but it's certainly there, and complex in its own  right.
I think you'll find that if you look back at when you first saw  the films in the theater, you'll understand what I'm talking about. Chewy  is just the same as Jar-Jar. Come on! A big furry animal that talks in  grunts and rips the arms out of people when they lose? That's just as dumb,  and yet likeable, as Jar-Jar Binks. If you think about it, it makes perfect  sense.
""The Phantom Menace"" is excellent. Period. I rate it up  there with ""A New Hope"". Any fan who can see beyond their  stubbornness will be able to appreciate the film for what it is. It's sure  to transport you back to the galaxy far far away just like it did 20 years  ago. Give it a chance.

665695,4,6303454038,"Movie:
 The Phantom Menace is an ok film. I believe that while it is a slight dissapointment, quite juvenile in some aspects, and occasionally fast and off-paced, it's fun to watch, provides a good introduction and opening to the series and can satisfy in a lot of areas for hard-core fans. Especially in the Jedi area. The Jedi are developed wonderfully in this movie. We get to see them before they were reduced to Yoda, Obi-Wan and Luke. We get to see when they were a big part in politics and a large influence in galactic affairs. The ideals of the council, the nature of the apprentice-master relationship and their fighting style. The lightsaber fights are breathtaking.
 In other aspects, the movie fails in a few areas. One being the character of Jar-Jar. Jar-Jar seems to be a good idea in concept. However, his execution comes off as exxagerated, annoying and excessive. While he can be occasionally entertaining, he says to much when he shouldn't be saying anything, he says the wrong things and he gets in the way. It's as if you're on a date with Star Wars and Jar-Jar is a third wheel. He is tolerable though and doesn't ""ruin"" the movie as many have said.
 The second problem is the character of Anakin, but he's not as big of a problem as Jar-Jar. It's mainly Anakin's lines. The piercing, groan-inducing ""Yippeee!"" should've been replaced with something like ""All-right!"". The line ""Now THIS is pod-racing"" should be totally removed. Other than that, Anakin is played rather well. And if you had seen his competition(see below), you'd understand why he was picked.
 The third problem is Darth Maul. Darth Maul is saddeningly underdeveloped. We never get a sense of how evil he is. He comes off more as a mere assassin than a trained sith-lord. There's a TV spot series(included in disc 2) in which one is voice-overed by Darth Maul reciting a poem about fear. This poem has more words than Maul's total lines and, I think, shouldve been included in the film somehow. If not, there should've been more scenes in which he talks more and discusses his dark-side ideals. Aside from Maul, Jar-Jar and Anakin, all the other characters are great. Anakin's mother Shmi(Pernilla August)gives the best performance. Amidala(Natalie Portman), the two Jedi(Neeson and McGregor) and Senator Palpatine(Ian McDiarmid) all give notable performances as well.
 My final problem is the pacing. Watching this movie is like being repeatedly punched in the gut in good and bad ways. It takes you from shot to shot showing you widespread oohs and aahs at an uneven and occasionally disappointing pace. You'll want to see more of a moment or location but the movie just whisks you away and says ""HEYLOOKATTHISNOW!NEATHUH?OKMOVINGON!""
 Aside from these problems, this is a really great movie. It's certainly worthy of the Star Wars name and is loads of fun to see multiple times. The conflict on Naboo and the way it spreads to encompass the characters is a good introduction. Theres a great blooper reel on this disc. To access it, use search mode on your remote and go to title 3. From what I've seen and heard, Episode 2: Attack of the Clones will not have any of Episode 1's problems and will be an incredible film, far surpassing an ok film like The Phantom Menace.
 Final Score for movie: 3.5 out of 5
Features:
 This is George Lucas' first DVD and it was long-anticipated. I can tell you it was worth the wait and certainly worth buying over the VHS version without a doubt.
DISC 1: The Movie
 Crisp, clear perfection. This movie was filmed digitally so when its recorded digitally, it's absolutly perfect. A far cry from VHS. This movie shares is pristine quality along the lines of seamless digital transfers of Pixar's Toy Story series, A Bug's Life, and Square Pictures' Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. You certainly won't be disappointed with the presentation. Plus, DVD has freeze-frame pausing unlike VHS's skippy jargled pausing. It's certainly an advantage in this movie for all the visuals you want to stop and soak in every little detail from. With DVD and a transfer this good, it's possible and really fun.
Disc 2: Special Features
 If you wanted to know all about how this movie was made, Disc two certainly satisfies. ""The Beginning"" is a highlight of this disc. A camera crew was given total unrestricted access to the sets and offices that made The Phantom Menace. 600 total hours were filmed. You get one hour of the best footage. It's really great stuff covering all stages of production. No voice overs and no cutting to cast and crew sitting in a room remeniscing. This documentary gives you a fly-on-the-wall kind of experience. You see it all as it happened. Theres tons of featurettes. If you're curious about any little aspect of the film be it design, production, casting, special effects and more, theres a featurette for it. One of which is called ""3000 Anakins""(the one I mentioned above) You can see quite a few of the kids who auditioned for Anakin. When seing the other two finalists, you will know why they picked Anakin, I assure you.
 All the trailers and TV-spots are there. The ""Duel of the Fates"" music video is great and it contains a few more behind the scenes shots. Movie Posters in more than a dozen languages are included. The production photo gallery is ok. Theres two scenes where you can view storyboards, rough animatics and final shot together or each one alone which is really neat. There's 7 deleted scenes, some of which have been reincorporated into the movie on disc 1. If you watch the documentary, you can find out why certain scenes were cut and a little backround on deleted scenes in general. One of the most impressive parts of this documentary is the breakdown of the cut waterfall scene. When they show you how they made the waterfall itself, its really cool to see. Theres also great additional bloopers (CG ones akin to those from Pixar's movies) at the end of the deleted scenes documentary. This is one of if not the best special feature discs out there and it might've been worth buying on its own for the same price.
Final score for features: 6 out of 5
Overall, if you liked Episode 1, you need to buy this DVD. If you kinda liked it, rent it. It's certainly worth seeing even just for the special features.

665696,3,6303454038,"I found that Episode I lacked a good plot and catered more to a 6-year-old rather than an adult, which is why I hesitate to recommend the movie to anyone else.  However, because I am an avid Star Wars fan, I have to admit  that I did enjoy watching the movie for the first time.
I know one of the  fatal flaws of the movie has been repeatedly stated by other reviewers, but  it can't be said enough: the digital character, Jar Jar Binks, was  horrible.  In short, Jar Jar looked fake, was annoying, and was too  cartoonish.  Although the digital effects that were used for the 'Pod race'  and space battles were impressive, it did not work well for Jar Jar.  A  puppet, like Yoda, would have been better as it looks more real.  Furthermore, Jar Jar was quite annoying: he was hard to understand and  contributed nothing to the plot.  I realize that George Lucas wanted Jar  Jar to be a comic relief character; Lucas had much better success with  C-3PO and R2-D2 in the original Star Wars movie.
The whole movie, Jar Jar  included, seemed childish.  The images and dialogue reminded me of a  Saturday morning cartoon.  The attempt at humor was puerile.  Watching the  clumsy Jar Jar trip over himself was not funny.
I believe that Lucas's  vision for this movie was to focus on the child (Anakin) leaving his mother  to begin an epic journey.  A better theme would have been to focus on  discipleship.  The relationship between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon had no  substance.  Instead, they appear on-screen as robots with no history  together.  In addition to focusing on the discipleship of Obi-Wan to  Qui-Gon--this could have been contrasted to the relationship between the  discipleship of Darth Maul to Darth Sidious (Maul and Sidious are both  villains in the movie while Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are the good guys).
In  the end, however, for the die hard Star Wars fans out there, I have to  recommend this movie.  If for no other reason, because 2 years is a long  time to wait before we see Episode II.",959212800,,2004,4.588068181818182
665697,3,6303454038,"Sure, it wasn't the worst movie ever made, but when you put Star Wars on the label, you had better have each part that made Star Wars memorable to start with.  I realize that it's nearly impossible for Lucas and co to  recreate that feeling, but couldn't they have had actors who believed in  their characters?  I'm sorry, but only the supporting cast was convincing.  Sure, Queen Armidillo was pretty, and basically the only decent actress  aside from the returning cast, and maybe Anakin(possible future in a few  years), and while Darth Maul didn't have Darth Vaders presence, he still  had the stare of evil.  Jar Jar Blinks was a decent 3D model, but as a  character, he was too annoying.  Definitely buy or rent it though, if only  to say that you want Episode 2 to come out and be better.  Que Gong Jim can  do a much better job than he did in this movie.  He was excellent in  Superman II and Schindlers list.  But if you want a movie with good actors,  and good FX, buy Galaxy Quest.

They were right about a few things, however.  The movie does  not have the emotional impact that episodes 4,5, and 6 had.  And the  special effects were way too dense, Lucas needed to calm down with those.  And yes, Jar Jar hurt the movie.

First of all i don't see how people could go so CRAZY over Darth Maul, he was such a big thing to everybody yet he was in the movie like 5 times or something, and a  total of like 10 min. Maybe he did and maybe he didn't, but I don't even  remember him talkig! So it dosn't make sense to me to go so wild over that  wierd person.  I also did not like Anikan Skywalker. He just had bad  acting. He also had a bad scrip too, but mostly it was the acting. The  character just wasn't realistic, he didn't act like a real 8 or 9 year old  boy.

However, I soon found out that was not the case  after watching the movie. The only reason people don't like the Phantom  Menace is because they aren't Star Wars fans! This is the best of the  series, and anybody who was impressed with the past three episdoes will  LOVE this movie! This episode gives you a clear picture of the story before  Luke's time, and will help you understand many of the questions that  arroused in the other three episodes. This movie also leaves you eager to  know what will happen in the next movie that is currently being filmed. The  special affects are absolutely incredible!  You can tell as time  progresses (and technology as well)that every movie gets better and better.  (both storyline and affects)Many parts of the movie just make you want to  say, ""Wow!"" over and over. Their is no telling how much time  George Lucas spent on scenes such as the Gungan city, the pod race, and the  lightsaber fight between the two Jedis and Darth Maul. Any Star Wars fan  will love this video. If you haven't yet seen it, then your missing a big  piece to the Star Wars trilogy. A superb video!",959040000,,1286,4.550218340611353
665703,4,6303454038,"A lot of negative reviews have been given about Episode I, beyond the scope of Amazon.  I never saw the original Episodes when they first came out in the movies.  I didn't even see them when they first came out on  video.  So when I did finally see all three (all within a week, about 2  years ago) I had a somewhat different perspective.  The special effects  were no longer as impressive as they were in 1979, but I still instantly  loved the trilogy.  Seeing Episode I in the theater was the first time I  saw Star Wars in the movies, so all you Episode I bitter people will  probably chalk it up to that, but I still greatly enjoyed the movie.  I  will say I have seen the video about 5 or 6 times, and I still love it.  I  will concede that Jar Jar was definitely not what Lucas probably intended  him to be, and not everyone is an Oscar contendor for their work.  But I  once heard George say in reference to this movie that he meant it to be  fun.  And that is what it was.  I thought the fighting scenes were  excellent, and to those who say the characters have little to no  sustinance, I believe a great deal is learned through and about Qui Gon Jin  and Obi Won, and look forward to learning more of Anaking and Obi Won in  the next movie. I think anyone who really strongly disliked this movie, or  called it a disappointment, went into it with the wrong attitude.  Did you  think Darth Maul would have had more or a presence in the film?  Perhaps,  but if you are a fan of Boba Fet then you really can't complain at all.  And if anything about the lineage of the characters of Star Wars and the  history of the Jedi interests you, then this film is well worth seeing.  Does Anakin seem like he will become Darth Vadar? No, and that is the whole  point.  If he did, well then we could skip right to Episode 4.  Though I  was just a little one at the time the first three movies came out, from  what I understand they did not get rave reviews when they came out either.  Perhaps 20 years later Phantom Menace will be looked upon as just another  Lucas Masterpiece.  To those of you lingering skeptics and critics who say  the film had nothing but effects, ask yourselves this: Who is the Phantom  Menace?  You may think the answer is obvious to you, but ask a friend  (preferrably one not as bitter).  I did, and it sparked a debate over two  different characters.  Not bad for a movie with ""no redeeming  qualities.""",958953600,3,2428,4.219298245614035
665704,2,6303454038,"The common theme running through George Lucas' work is visual genius  marked by artistic laziness.  Like most geniuses, Lucas works best within a  limited palette of expertise.  If you want stunning visuals and bombastic  sound, he's your man.  If you want a storyline with some level of  sophistication beyond Saturday morning cartoons, it's best to look  elsewhere.
Star Wars fans (and I consider myself one) can whine all  they want, but childishness is an inherent part of Lucas' cinematic ouevre.
Whenever Lucas steps away from the controls and lets someone else drive  the plot, the results are as amazing as ""The Empire Strikes  Back"", the hands-down favorite of most Star Wars fans.  When George is  actively engaged in the script, we get dreck like the Ewoks and Phantom  Menace's Jar Jar Binks.
""Episode I-The Phantom Menace"" could  never live up to its prerelease hype in any event, but with Lucas firmly in  command the movie is even more execrable than may otherwise have been the  case.  How bad is it?
- The incoherent plot involves some nonsense  about interstellar trade regulations
- The Force, previously a kind of  New Age mysticism, now seemingly stems from a parasitic infection
- The  main force for good is a 14-year old ""elected queen"" of a planet  named Naboo, of all things, who spends much of the movie in Kabuki makeup  speaking in desultory monotone
- The villain never speaks a word, and  seemingly exists for the sole purpose of having a lightsaber duel with two  of the heroes
- A major character actually chooses slavery over freedom,  mainly as a cheap way to write her out of subsequent scenes
- Unlike Luke  Skywalker, who had a painful and awkward apprenticeship before emergind as  a full-blown hero in ""Return of the Jedi"", Anakin Skywalker is  invincible from the word go, despite being only 9 years old
The movie is  a colossal disappointment, and not just due to the inflated expectations of  fans.  While a number of the visuals are simply stunning, the plot is a  total mess, which substantially undermines the movie's impact.  The final  victory comes so cheaply and ridiculously as to serve as a sort of parody  of the first film (imagine Luke destroying the Death Star in a Landspeeder  while on the way to Tachi Station to look at some power convertors and  you'll see what I mean).
Fans hope against hope that the second  installment will counter this trend and restore some sense of menace to the  series.  Unfortunately, this installment is to be the love story, and if  Lucas handles it as childishly as the ""Phantom Menace"", fans  hearts will be the only ones broken.

Plus there are some great new vehicles, cities and alien species.  The downside of The Phantom Menace is the lack of any characters as good as Han, Luke or *Old* Ben from the original trilogy.  Good characters are essential for a good film, and here we just get Jar-Jar instead. Darth Maul is promising, but he's woefully underused and only has two lines of dialogue.

665819,4,6303454038,"If you are judging this movie based on all the other movies out there, this is definitely near the top of the heap.
However, Star Wars films will always be judged by a higher standard. ""The Phantom Menace""  doesn't quite make it up to the level of the first three.
This isn't just  nostalgia for the old films that's causing me to say this. All in all,  ""Phantom Menace"" was just a bit weaker than the others.
For  example, the characters weren't quirky enough for you to really get to love  them. The two Jedi's were both quite serious, the queen wasn't all that  interesting, and the bad guys really didn't terrify me the same way Darth  Vader could.  There needed to be someone like Han to liven things up  (though I do have to say that Anakin was a strength of this movie).
I  know that was supposed to be JarJar's role, but please...I couldn't laugh  at him because he got so annoying by the middle of the movie. Add that to  the fact that it was very difficult to understand him, and one wonders if  Lucas is having any second thoughts about the huge role JarJar  got.
However, much so ink has already been spilled about JarJar that I  won't belabor the point.
The big battle scene at the end kept reminding  me of the strikingly similar scene in ""Jedi."" The feeling of  dejavu was so strong that it left me wondering if the writers could have  made this one a little fresher.
All that said, the special effects and  animation was excellent. The plot, while not too deep, kept me interested.  Overall it's not a bad movie, but Star Wars fans are hoping for something a  little better with Episode II.",958608000,,1606,4.394557823129252

As for those who thought that Epsiode I was a load of  rubbish, I think that perhaps you should stick to romantic comedies, not  science fiction movies like this one.
Once again, I thought that this  movie (and the book) was absolutely well done in every way. I find that  every time I watch it, I see something new!! An excellent movie for the  young at heart or for the oringinal Star Wars fans. May The Force Be With  You!!!",958608000,,735,4.492424242424242
665821,5,6303454038,"I am so tired of the criticism Episode I is receiving, because it is actually one of the most beautiful movies ever made. And I'm not only talking about the visuals here. I could go into an extremely lengthy  explanation of why I think this, but I think I'd be wasting my time. The  bottom line is that Lucas has tried something a bit different but still  very much in the spirit of Star Wars. Instead of continuing down the beaten  path, he has expanded the universe with a more serious side. We get to see  political intricacies, a *real* queen (instead of the gung-ho Leia) and  Jedi Knights in peak condition. Brilliant film, and a very good prologue  for Episode II and III. Brilliant acting (maybe except for our little  Anakin played not too convincingly but still quite charmingly by Jake  Lloyd) by all cast members. Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor  stand out in particular. Amazing soundtrack by John Williams. And -yes I  really mean this- wonderful storyline that hints skillfully at greater  things to come. And for the record, I *have* seen the original trilogy  countless times, but I think Episode I is right up there with it in terms  of quality.  And maybe *gasp* even higher :) Well done Lucas!",958521600,2,1228,4.6465116279069765
665822,1,6303454038,"Yeah I know... there's already nearly a thousand Amazon user reviews about this movie. I figured I might as well put my two cents in along with everyone else. I got nothin' better to do anyway...
Having been a big  geekin' fanboy of the original trilogy, my twisted sense of loyalty to  George Lucas's little galaxy far, far away had me at the multiplex waiting  to see Episode I. Two weeks after its premiere of course. Hey, I might be a  maven of the `Wars, but I sure as hell wasn't gonna stand in a miles-long  line for five hours just to see one of the very first showings. I might be  a loser, but I'm not that far gone!
I should have read the warning signs.  I can usually tell how good or bad a movie's gonna be by viewing the  theatrical trailer for it. After seeing Episode I's preview before 'Star  Trek: Insurrection' came on (yep, I cut both ways), I was less than  excited. But, I decided to give the film a fair shake. After all, it is  written, produced, and directed by one of the most successful filmmakers in  cinema history. Perhaps it'll be an exception to my ""Rule of Movie Trailer  Viewing"".
Unfortunately, in this instance, I should have gone with my  better judgment. To start off, I thought there were way too many CGI  effects, and a few of them looked downright bad.  One example of this was  at the movie's beginning, a panoramic shot of Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon taking a  thirty-foot leap from a vent shaft and landing on the deck of the Trade  Federation flagship's cargo bay. Also, whenever I viewed a scene made up  mostly or entirely of Computer effects, it looked to me to be more like a  glorified animated feature than live-action. Three examples: the Gungan -  Trade Fed droid battle; Qui-Gon, Obi Wan, and Jar Jar Binks's escape from  the ocean monsters; and someome parts of the Boonta pod race were less  convincing to me as well. Don't get me wrong, I think CGI effects have  great potential, and the look and realism keeps getting better; I just  don't think the medium has advanced enough yet to look absolutely and  uncannily realistic. I'm still a big fan of using physical models, like  what was used in the original Star Wars flicks, in space movies.  I guess  I'm just an old fogey at heart.
And boy, did they ever pump up the hype  on Darth Maul! He was Episode I's coolest- looking character, yet he was  seen for maybe ten minutes overall! And, after being able to fend off two  opponents with some amazing martial arts skills and split-second reactions,  he just stood there when Obi-Wan leapt and cut him down! This guy, with  lightning-fast moves and force-heightened awareness, was somehow unable to  dodge getting split when he had almost two seconds of time to react? I'm  sorry, I just can't buy that.  But there was some good to come out of it-  the lightsaber ""duel"" between Maul and Qui-Gon & Obi-Wan was admittedly  the best Star Wars ""sword"" fight yet.
Also, as far as I can see, this  trilogy as it unfolds is gonna be a downer to view. Think about it... we'll  eventually be witnessing the fall of the Republic, the rise of Chancellor  Palpatine and the Empire, the turning of Anakin into Darth Vader, and the  killing off of nearly all of the Jedi Knights.  I do not relish the  prospect of the other prequels depressing me with the horrible events to  come. Pass the prozac, please...
Then there's Jar Jar Binks. The way I  see it, if G.L. wanted so badly to have slapstick humor in the movie, he  should've put in an intermission with a Looney Tunes short. I consider him  to be one of the most useless and pathetic characters to ever sully the  silver screen. Of course, I've voiced my thoughts to a few Star Wars fanboy  cronies, many of whom thought I was insane to knock the `Jar. They even  went so far to state that his purpose was to be annoying; that's why he's  there. Yeesh. It's pretty sad when one comes up with logic like that to try  and justify a widely reviled character's existence. All I can say is, when  I see Gilbert Gottfried in a movie, I know that his purpose is to be  annoying, too. Yet it doesn't necessarily make it more enjoyable; usually,  the opposite effect occurs.
Actually, I have an idea for offing the  Jar-man REALLY early in Episode II. You know how each Star Wars movie  starts with the opening ""Story So Far"" crawl? Well, for Episode II, I see  it falling downward, rather than up. J.J.'s at the bottom of the screen,  lashed to a gurney, fully restrained, waiting for the bottom edge of the  crawl to decapitate him. But this time, it comes downward much more slowly  than usual. Everybody in the theatre endures the excruciatingly long, yet  strangely satisfying, moment as it reaches its climax... and then...hee hee...  AND THEN...HAHAHAHA!

I think it did an excellent  job of setting up the next two movies--that's why the plot  can seem drawn  out, Lucas is giving us the whole picture of what is going on for the next  two movies.

I think enough has been said about the content of the film itself.  There will always be endless debate about how  great/horrible the movie  was, about how funny/moronic/racist/utterly worthless Jar Jar Binks  was/is... but I digress. The movie is actually enjoyable & very  watchable (coming from someone who has seen it over 1 dozen times  already)... like John Williams said, it's a great Saturday afternoon movie.  Great introduction to the young Obi-Wan Kenobi and his teacher Qui-Gon Jinn  (if he trained Ol' Ben, though, how come he never mentions him in the later  films?, Darth Maul is totally cool and wields a pretty mean lightsaber,  Jake Lloyd is adorable as Anakin, Natalie Portman is wooden as Queen  Amidala, and Samuel L. Jackson & Pernilla August turn in pretty good  supporting roles. The widescreen edition is presented in a pretty cool  format, with the 35mm cell and the booklet. Technically, the video is above  average. Good thing I bought the widescreen version; when I started to  watch the pan & scan version, halfway through the film the picture  became distorted & jumpy, eventually becoming totally unwatchable. When  I returned the film for an exchange, the cashier mentioned that they had  some problems with a lot of tapes that were returned for similar reasons...  so much for THX mastering. The picture is not as clear as I though it would  have (& should have) been; it tends to jump in certain places, and  happens to be more noticeable in the pan & scan version. I checked it  out on at least 3 different VCR's so it's the tape that has the problem.  The Dolby Pro Logic soundtrack, however, is another story; rich and very  deep in the bass parts, the soundtrack stands out from the get go (with the  THX ""test"" before the film begins). The lightsabers hum all  around the room and the starships sound (& feel) like they are taking  off in your living room. Highlights include the various lightsaber duels  (which put the duels in the original trilogy to shame), the space assault  on the Trade Federation, the unbelievable Boonta Eve pod race, and the  obligatory celebration at the end of the film. George Lucas tends to go  overboard on some of the CGI in this film, with the cardinal sin of making  Jar Jar Binks a major character. The film lacks the imagination that Lucas  used in the first film. Instead of thinking a scene out (like the now  legendary Creature Cantina sequence), with the current technology Lucas can  just digitally drop crap into every scene without thinking about it. It  shows in many of the scenes, none more so than the droid/Gungan battle. On  the whole, however, the movie is fun to watch and pretty much geared  towards children (how else to explain the cuteness of Anakin & the  buffoonery of Jar Jar?)

There are instances  within the movie that people have found disappointing, certain characters  like Jar Jar binks, our young anakin (could you imagine a child less like  Darth Vada! ) and Queen Amidala, or the lack of Darth Maul scenes that had  so whetted our appetites from previews (WHY DID HE HAVE TO .....

666059,4,6303454038,"Lucas managed to make such an event out of the release of The Phantom Menace that I wasn't sure how to feel about it. I must have read ten articles, watched adverts and trailers and I even caught a part of the  ""making of"" on TV. Talk about building expectations, how could  anything, barring the second coming, live up to it all. I suppose that was  the question going through my mind as I approached the cinema. Would you  believe I was even a little nervous?

Yes the cinematography was  breathtaking, the effects were cutting edge, the design was first class,  blah blah blah. But that's not what makes a good film. Does it have a  decent story, interesting characters, suspense, action? In short, does it  pack enough emotional content? Well, in this case... Yes, it does. How could  I think George Lucas might let me down.

I happen to think Natalie  Portman stole the show entirely, but maybe her beauty and the fabulous  costumes had something to do with it. And, as much as the first Star Wars  was cast with relatively unknown actors, Liam Neeson added just the right  touch of weight to the ensemble. Of course I wouldn't be the first to  suggest Ewan McGregor is going to be giving us memorable performances for  years to come and I'm not talking about the Star Wars prequels. All in all,  a stand out cast were able to make what could have been a light sci-fi  romp, into another classic.

During the early moments of the story,  we join two Jedi, only this time they are set amid a backdrop where Jedi  are thick on the ground and are given routine tasks, like diplomatic  negotiation. Obi-Wan is familiar to us but not as a young man yet to be  promoted to Jedi knight. His friend and master, Qui-Gon Jinn, is the other  Jedi and it is this duo that teaches us the true nature of a Jedi's role.  In the first films the Jedi culture was all but extinct. In The Phantom  Menace it is in full flower and we can watch in awe as Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan  defy poison gas, blast shielding and military robots. In fact it isn't  until they come up against another, albeit darker, proponent of the Jedi  arts, that they are forced to pause.

I have to say, Darth Maul was  wonderful. I suppose it was always going to be a tough job coming up with a  ""bad guy"" concept to match Darth Vader but wow! Ray Park was and  is a stunt-man rather than an actor but during the final fight scene where  force fields temporarily separate the combatants, his frustrated strides  brought to mind a caged tiger. I certainly didn't envy our heroes, waiting  to face such an animalistic warrior.

There are quite a few set  piece scenes in the film, all of them memorable. The journey through the  center of the earth was fabulous; talk about your perfect fishing hole. The  pod race was probably a little over cooked but fun none the less. And it  did contain a nice homage to the locked fenders in ""Return of the  Jedi"". But for me, it was the little things which won my heart. Like  the moment when Padme, ""Hand-maiden to the Queen"", is scrubbing  the heroic R2-D2 but takes a moment to comfort the young Anakin who's just  coming to terms with a potentially permanent separation from his mother.  It's all the more poignant after we learn more about Padme's true role.

So, as much as I was anticipating the release of Episode One, I am  now left with the distressing feeling that the true test of my patience is  still to come. I have two years to wait for Episode two and who knows when  ""three"" will appear. We're waiting George, we're waiting.",957830400,3,3536,4.429906542056075

Find something better to do than make  fun of an imaginary character. 2. Anakin Skywalker. Sure Jake Lloyd's not  the world's best actor, but he's a heck of a lot better than some other  actors today. 3. The acting. I feel it had the exact same acting feel as  the other movies. 4. The plot. There wasn't just one plot, there were  several different subplots. I rate this movie up with the other three.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

It is an empty, soulless film that lacks the spirit, adventure and human element that made the  previous trilogy so memorable. George Lucas was so caught up in the digital  technology and special effects that he thought little about story  construction and character development. (If you blink, you'll miss Samuel  L. Jackson - whose role is incredibly miniscule.) To make matters worse,  Lucas sabotaged his own film with the obnoxious creation of Jar Jar Binks.  The only memorable sequence in ""Phantom Menace"" is the pod race,  which was ripped off from ""Ben Hur"" and ""Viva Las  Vegas"" (I kid you not).

Just as Jet Jaguar is to ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" (1973)  or Robin to the Batman series. It does have great special effects scenes  through out the entire movie with starships and podracers galore! Queen  Amidala plays an interesting character in the republic's struggles. Adding  the unmade C-3PO in the movie was a good idea to mix in more characters  from the classic series into the new film. Darth Maul is quite frankly one  of the coolest bad guys on the movie screens ( beating out King Ghidorah on  my list ). Anikan is a good character, but plays it again too much reared  to real little kids and kind of hard for older people to relate to. All the  robots in the film are cool but it poses some questions to me. Why do they  have more advanced vehicals and droids in this movie than are in the 1977  ""Star Wars""? They have battle droid robots to get fried instead  of the real human Stormtroopers, obviously they were smarter in the past.

Some people have critisized the Phantom Menace's plot though I think it is one of the best I have seen  in a while. Of course the main critisizm of the plot was that it seemed  unfinished. My answer to this is: well duh. Episode 1 is not quite as good  as the original trilogy storywise, but what can you expect it is basicaly  the first chapter in a story and first chapters are never the best. And hey  having a story that's ""not quite as good as the original trilogy""  is still pretty good.
  The acting is pretty good all around with the  only exception I can think of being Jake Lloyd (the young Anakin). I kinda  thought his acting left a bit to be desired with such lines as  ""yippee"", and ""wizard"". However this is more than made  up for by the stellar perforamnces of Liam Neeson (Qui-gon Jinn) and Ian  McDiarmond (Senator Palpatine).
  In terms of special effects I still  can't believe that The Phantom Menace didn't win the Oscar. They were  simply incredible and no other movie effects in history has even come close  to the ones in Episode 1.
  All in all I would recommend this movie for  everyone. It's a fun family movie but there are layers to it so as to make  it interesting for everyone. Have Fun!",957484800,,1335,4.407407407407407

Sanity, thy name is VCR. Well, it wouldn't be a Star Wars  movie without bad acting and dopey dialogue. But, how in the world could  three otherwise very fine actors (Neeson, McGregor, and Portman) end up  giving such bland and inept performances? In addition, how could the pacing  of the narrative be so slow and choppy?  There's only one person to blame:  George Lucas.  He has obviously stayed away from the director's chair too  long.  My advice to Lucas is to hire someone else to direct and write the  screenplay for the next film.  He set the precedent with The Empire Strikes  Back, hiring Irvin Kershner to direct and Lawrence Kasdan & Leigh  Brackett to write the screenplay.  The result:  Empire is generally  considered the best film of the trilogy.  Alas, I'm a sucker for great  special effects.  As a result, I'm giving SW1 four stars, saving it from  the  2 star drubbing the rest of the movie deserves.  The pod race is  incredible, a pure adrenaline rush.  The other great sequence is the  lightsaber duel between Darth Maul and our two friendly neightbourhood  Jedis.  Jar Jar Binks? Tie him up, put a thermal detonator in his mouth,  and feed him to a giant space slug. Lucas has a penchant for multiple  climax sequences.  He's progressed from one in Star Wars (Death star  battle), two in Empire (Luke v. Vader; Leia, et al escaping from Cloud  city), and three in Jedi (Endor battle, Death star battle, light saber  duel).  He ends SW1 with another three pronged display of bellicosity.  Does that mean he'll end the next film with only two simultaneous battle  sequences, and the one after that with one, in chiastic fashion?

Many die-hard fans have felt betrayed by this movie.  But I  say to you, ""You must unlearn... unlearn!""  In no way is this  movie a betrayal.  Every complaint that has been levelled against it (lousy  comedics, plot holes, annoying dialogue, formulaic ending) can easily be  drilled into Episodes IV, V, and VI as well.  Which is why it seems silly  to revere the originals with such vaunted praise.  Yes, they were all  phenomenal movies.  But why?  Not because of the acting!  Not because of  the plot!  No, it was because Star Wars is, at heart, a gorgeous feast for  the senses.  Sabres flash, podracers soar, blasters blast, aliens quip and  entrance, and when the pseudo-philosophical meanderings get a bit too  thick, blasters blast some more.  People - this is an adventure movie!  Think pulp.  Think space opera.  But don't think, ""This is not the  spiritual experience that was Return of the Jedi!""  (BWAHAH! *Ahem*  Excuse me.)

The problems were in the characters.  Jar Jar did a VERY poor job of replacing R2-D2 in the comic relief role.  His base humor seemed more appropriate for a Three Stooges film than Star  Wars.  Added to the other connotations he illicits, he is a very poor  character choice indeed.  In fact, I don't think I've ever prayed for one  of the good-guys to die before!  The acting was nominal, but the plot used  foreshadowing and formula to the point that there were no surprises at all.  The dark hero persona (Han Solo previously) was also sorely missed.  The  story was just plain bland!  I really hope Mr. Lucas will listen to his  fans and not repeat these mistakes (and yes they are mistakes!) in the  future installments.

The bizarre group of people who think that this is a great film like to contend that the original three  movies had set our expectations at a level that could not be met.  Firstly,  I would say that if Lucas and Co. are the geniuses that these people think  they are, they could have met even the highest expectations.  Secondly, my  expectations and those of others who were disappointed were not terribly  high.  I expected a simple story (like the others) that would be enhanced  by the Star Wars mythology and great special effects.  To be honest, though  I love them, the first trilogy of films had flaws - they were somewhat  trite and had an oversimplified cold-waresque feel.  But they were never  embarrassing, never made me blush and bury my head into my lap in shame as  The Phantom Menace did (at the moments where they boldly announced that  Annakin was born of a virgin and tried to give a blood based explanation of  the force).  In short I expected little and got much much less.
Here's  what I expected:  In a science fiction, action based film, the characters  should all have life or death objectives.  Most of the characters here are  only half motivated.  The queen and her people have a motivation but  figures like the Jedi and Annakin and that awful Jar Jar are just sort of  lead around from location to location without any real reason to be there.  Sure, I understand that the Jedi are defenders of all that's good and thus  their motivation is the Queens' but they seem lost.  The good actors that  Lucas won get chewed up by the scenery and their terrible (I repeat  TERRIBLE) lines of dialogue.
Something else that the first trilogy had  was a mystery - as the characters voyaged towards personal discovery and  the discovery of the Universe and both slowly opened to the audience.  This  mood that there is something out there to be discovered is something most  people seem to forget about.  None of that is here.  And sure, I understand  that replicating that would be difficult but I know that Lucas and Co.  didn't try.  And if they were going to completely throw out the tone and  mood that made the earlier films great, well then maybe they should not  have made the coming trilogy at all.  In the end, this trilogy will only  diminish the earlier ones for future generations if they sit down to watch  them in order, because the mystery of the force and Luke's familial  identity will be gone.  In the end, taken as a body of stories, there will  be no mystery to any of it.  Why would an artist sabotage how their work  will be accepted when they are gone?  Answer:  Lucas is not an artist.  Maybe he was before but not he is a corporate entity concerned with making  the most dollars, which releasing these three films will do.",957398400,8,2875,4.529411764705882

It has a somewhat interesting  plot and a couple of twists and turns that I did not even predict despite  the fact that I had read a lot about this movie before it even came out.  The number one reason to get this movie though is probably the special  effects and the attention to detail.  Lucas is a master at making sure that  everything is there for a reason and makes sense for a reason.
This  particular edition is also really nice the half an hour introductory scene  about the making of the movie is very interesting and was very informative.

666314,4,6303454038,"As a Star Wars fan it is my resposibility to point out the high and low points of this film.  First I would like to do a short analysis for some of the major characters.
Qui-Gon: His role was one of the things that really  held this film together.  Liam did a great job as this Jedi  Master
Obi-Wan:  Ewan did a great job portraying Obi in his apprentice  years.  His character was very believable.
Queen Amidala: Natalie did a  fairly good job portraying the young queen.  Few of her lines came off  lame.
Anakin Skywalker:  How could you.  I think George could have found  a much better actor to portray somebody so important to the Star Wars story  like that kid from the Sixth Sense Haley Joel.  His lines came across very  lame.
Darth Maul:  He was my favorite character of the film because he  was so cool.  Ray Parks martial arts skills are unbelievable.  However, his  character should have been developed much more.
Darth Sidious:  Very  mysterious.  Personally I think he is the Emperor himself, only time will  tell.  His character is very sith-like.
Senator Palpatine:  As always,  Ian Mcdiarmid does a great job portraying the greedy senator who is soon to  become the Emperor. Jar Jar Binks:  He should not have even been a main  character.  He stole so much of the show and should have had 50% less  screen time.
The plot of this movie wasn't all that bad which was the  blockade and boycott of Trade routes to the planet of Naboo.  I feel as  though a lot more will be explained in the upcoming movie which is due for  a May 2002 release.  Some parts of the movie were very predicatable such as  the podrace.  The lightsaber fights were just mind boggling.  Once again I  say that Ray Park was perfectly fit for the role of Darth Maul because he  is capable of doing all the fancy kicking and knows how to fight with a  double-edged sword.  However, the journey back to Tatooine and the  lightsaber fights were nostalgic and brought back a lot of the Star Wars  atmosphere.  The reason why I gave this movie 4 stars is because of Jar Jar  and Anakin.  Everything else fell perfectly into place.  This will probably  remain one of my favorite movies and with the exeption of those two  characters, it is worthy of its position in the Star Wars saga.",957139200,,2264,4.461728395061728
666315,1,6303454038,"This movie ranks right up there with ""Dune"" when it comes to really expensive and really bad movies.  It has great special effects, but don't expect much more than that.  The acting was bad and the dialogue was  stupid.  Oddly enough, and despite the state-of-the-art special effects,  the movie has a strongly ""dated"" feeling--watching it is a bit  like traveling back in time to 1977, as the acting, dialogue, plot  development, and editing seem not to have progressed since then.  And this  is even more of a ""guy"" movie than the previous Star Wars movies.  Will we ever find out why the Jedi are always male, even when they're not  human?
As far as the much-maligned Jar Jar Binks, maybe I wouldn't have  hated the character so much if I'd been able to understand what he was  saying!  Did ANYbody listen to his so-called dialogue before inflicting  this movie on the public?
Perhaps the biggest problem is that the  director couldn't decide whether to make a movie for kids or for adults; he  tried to please both, but instead an adult will find much of the movie  really stupid, and a child will find much of it incomprehensible.",957139200,3,1135,4.646464646464646

Some movies, like ""Last Action Hero"", can succeed at this level, by  offering a satirical edge in addition to the fantasy element (which is more  appealing to the youthful crowd); even pure fantasy movies  (""Brazil"" or ""Willow"") can be appealing to adults. But  this is clearly a kid's movie, since the main character is 11 or so. I  realize that, in order to set up the eventual parts 4,5, and 6 (or  whatever), the characters need to start out young. That's no excuse for  making Star Wars into a kid's film (I mean, even ""Flight of the  Navigator"" can be entertaining to an adult; this wasn't.).

I went to the theatre the 2nd day of its long awaited release.  In one word:  disappointed!  I know the special effects were awesome.  With the great pod  racing scene and lightsaber dual against Darth Maul.  Thats what made it  get three stars.  The acting was nothing respectable and rather corny.  Anakin's ""Yippe"" had less enthusiasm then my keyboard does. I  would buy this but only settled for a viewing in the theatre and a rental  because no DVD!  Which is very upsetting.  George Lucas, you are losing  sales with a no dvd decision, including mine!",957052800,,700,4.532258064516129
666428,3,6303454038,"Just like any other Star Wars fans, I awaited the 1st prequel with much anticipation & glee.  But after viewing the movie, I asked myself, is this it.  I wasn't convinced & back I went to the cinema for a second  viewing but still, the answer remained the same.  I had viewed the Star  Wars sequels countless of times but never I felt any sense of boredom  creeping in.  They all are classics to me & they are that good!  Considering that the sequels were shot 20 years ago give & take, George  Lucas' brilliance is undeniable.  This time around, with better technology,  special effects offered is definitely the highlight of the movie with the  much talked about pod racing, Jar Jar Bink which certainly provided a lot  of light hearted moment.  Natalie Portman's performance was quite  restrained, probably noticing that there's a massive responsibility for her  to carry over her shoulder, so as not to disappoint lots of legions of fans  for the Star Wars series.  Samuel Lawrence was quite subdued as a Jedi  & I preferred to see him re-enacting his role in the Pulp Fiction, or  even his role in the Negotiator, anytime.  Liam Neeson provided a much  needed screen presence.  The highlight of the movie would be the duel  between the Jedis & Darth Maul & it's ashamed that Darth Maul was  killed off that simply.  For such a lethal opponent like him, he should be  leaving in a big bang rather than in the piece meal fashion as offered in  the movie.  Well, probably the fault solely lies on me, who has too high of  an expectation which the movie couldn't provide.  But to be truthful, no  matter how neat the presentation is, it's lacking of this thing called  soul.  Just hope that the second offering would be better or much improved.  Considering that the 2nd instalment is to be shot in Sydney, probably,  there's going to be a cameo appearance of creatures in the form of kangaroo  or koala bear that could sing ""Waltzing Matilda""!",957052800,,1945,4.5982404692082115

666430,3,6303454038,"Well I'm no great fan of sci-fi but there is a magic about Star Wars I don't doubt so curiosity and childhood memories dragged me to the cinema to check out the new face of Star Wars. The beauty of the original Star Wars  films was their ability to make the glittering effects a part of the story,  not just a distraction. In a time now of special effects but stale films it  is near impossible to make a Star Wars film to live up to the expectations  of the fans. Given what they were up against I think the makers of The  Phantom Menace were on the right lines. Dodgy characters and tacky acting  aside it has that Star Wars touch to it.
So what was wrong with the  acting? Liam Neeson does a fantastic job with Obi-Wan, his character almost  single-handedly holding the atmosphere together. Ewan McGregor is a bit  more stale but the rest of the cast pretty much stink. It wasn't till R2D2  popped up and started warbling that a smile returned to my face and I  remembered I was still watching Star Wars.
Unfortunately the problem with  Star Wars is that it is such a commercial prospect for toy companies and  suchlike that we inevitably get the `kiddy' aspect which comes in the form  the Jar Jar character. I wanted to cry with embaressment.
What this  lacked was the mystery and the suspense that existed in The Empire Strikes  Back, instead the makers have gone for the more commercial childs version  that was Return of the Jedi. Its all a matter of what audience to please  and all the Star Wars films have the same atmosphere but approached at  different angles. We'll probably find the next one is a lot darker as we  are led up to the Star Wars so many know and love.
Theres plenty of  moments in here that shine but its a case of glueing them all together. The  moments which oozed Star Wars magic for me were the fantastic fight  sequence with Darth Maul towards the end, the enemy soldier robot things  and the general atmosphere of the Emperor himself. More of this and less of  the Jar-Jar guy please, lets have a Star Wars film more for the adults than  for the kids next time so we all get a taste of the pie.

666431,2,6303454038,"For the uninitiated, the G. Lucas American film series about warfare amongst the stars is a peculiar look at parallel universes and strange creatures interacting with humans in an attempt to secure peace throughout  the galaxy.  Indeed, this war amongst the stars, or ""Star Wars""  as it is called, is indeed a film series about love and betrayal, incest  and abandonment, good midgets and bad midgets, strange fish creatures with  too much power, and robots.  Indeed, this film series (whose art house  qualities remind the intellectual filmgoer of the Decalogue in scope, or  perhaps a parallel can be best made between Star Wars and the Trois  Couleurs Trilogy, in that both series exhibit semi-paradoxical tendencies  for the both the surreal and the comic while trying to maintain at least  some semblance of the post-modernistic cliche of parallel bereavement and  longing for the freudian (or perhaps jungian would be better) other in that  the subconscious is always expressed in terms of pseudo-violence, usually  directed towards the self but often manifested in the form of senseless  destruction against establishment regulation.  It is important to remember  this war amongst the stars in these quasi-anthropological terms, for the  genesis of such serial work too can have its roots in the experimental  (think of the obvious parallels between Return of the Jedi and, say, Man  With a Movie Camera).

666432,4,6303454038,"The first time I watched this, I was not overly impressed.  There was no way this could ever have lived up to my expectations after all these years.  I have sinced watched it about 3 more times and find that I can really  appreciate it now for what it is.  Is it as good as any movie in the first  trilogy?  Not really.  Is it the piece of garbage everybody seems to think  they're cool by saying it is?  Not by a long shot, folks.  There are  definitely some great moments here and some fine acting.  High points?  The  light sabre battles here make the ones from the first trilogy seem like  they're in slow motion - and Darth Maul is one tough customer indeed.  The  pod race was awesome (this scene is the best argument ever for widescreen  over pan and scan),  and one of the coolest parts in the movie for me were  the tusken radiers shooting at the pods - great touch!  Also, there are a  lot of hidden things you might not notice the first few times.  A perfect  example is when Watto is talking to Qui Jon after the pod race and you can  see (and hear) one of Darth Maul's probe droids whiz by behind them.  Brilliant.  Now, the low points:  JarJar drives me insane.  He must be  considered a noble failure and I can only hope that Lucas sends him on some  inter-stellar turd hunt in the next film.  He's really not that bad, but he  has more screen time than just about anybody.  Also, the announcers for the  pod race still make me cringe every time.  Overall, I thought this was a  fine movie, and I would encourage those of you trying to be cool by bashing  it to at least watch the thing again and give it a chance.

I don't get all you people who say that the story was dumb and it was all special effects, this story was better written than A  New Hope. I am not saying that it is a better story than ""A New  Hope"" because it is the same story; Young hero from Tatooine meets up  with a Jedi, leaves his home planet and family, meets royalty whom he falls  in love with, Jedi is killed by evil villian, he saves the day by blowing  up big starship.  You can't expect the first movie to be the best because  they have to put alot of backround in it to introduce the rest of the  movies and they have to get you to love about ten characters in a hour and  a half. I was a little disapionted when Liam Neeson's character died,  I  hope he comes back as a ghost in the next movie, like Ben Kenobi did in  ""The Emipire Strikes Back"".  And I have to admit that Jar Jar did  get a bit annoying at times.

Unlike others, I didn't think the VHS quality was poor at all. But I am still looking forward to the DVD.",956966400,,413,4.52
666436,5,6303454038,"This is the widescreen edition and it is very nice.  I was only watching it on a 19"" screen, so the image was kind of small but it was still very nice.
I won't talk about the Star Wars movie itself, because most  people have either seen it or don't want to.  If you haven't seen it, but  enjoy other Star Wars movies, are a Sci-Fi person, or like action and  special effects, you'll like The Phantom Menace.  I only had a cheap stereo  system and a 2-head mono VCR to watch it on, but it was nice.  I imagine  that sound on a good Dolby Surround Sound system would be good.
It comes  in a nice collector's box.  However, the packaging is thin cardboard and  I'm sure I'll step on it soon enough and it will be ruined.
The film  cells are a nice bonus. (I got pictures of the underwater city).  They come  in a small paper frame and you can hold it up to the light to see what you  have.
It comes with an excerpt from the Art of Star Wars book.  Once  again, a nice bonus.  It has a lot of pictures and interesting  facts.
It's too bad it's not on DVD because then you'd have the  Six-Channel Dolby Digital Sound and an even crisper picture.  The tape is  good quality, and even when pausing, the picture is sharp.  If you're  waiting for DVD, don't wait.  It won't be until 2003 or later when it'll  come out on DVD.

The first film was so ""everthing"" a movie should be, that the others films and this one have suffered by comparison plus  Phantom Menace had the additonal handicap of having to live up to both the  expectations of fans,plus the hype, both of which were impossible.  Character development is not as strong here as in previous films, and no  clear-cut, all-powerful (almost) villian ala' Darth Vader hurts badly, but  the special effects, especially the pod race,are all any Star War fan could  hope for.  The Jar-Jar Binks character is annoying, yes, but degrading? I  disagree there.  ""The Force"" assumes more religous/supernatural  overtones than in previous movies.  It does seem to me that Lucas has a lot  of ground to cover to connect Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader in only two  more movies, but that is not my problem thankfully.

That's why Lucas had to make Darth Maul look like Satan. It's probably also  why he had to add that crazy side kick Jar Jar Binks. Not that I hated it,  it just wasn't worth a ten year wait.

Critics also bashed the first Star Wars when it came out in  1977 but now look at it and the movies have become among the most popular  of movies. Anyways, the plot for this new installation in the Star Wars  serious is much more thicker then the older films. I know, the characters  are very shallow and Jar Jar Binks is downright annoying. I see no use for  him except a ploy used by the movie makers to make the kiddies laugh.  Little Jake Loydd did O.K. as Anakin, he still has a lot of maturing to do,  but he did more then I expected. Besides, Star Wars doesn't need Oscar  nominating Acting! It's all about fun. The special effects are simply  astounding and takes your breath away. The vistas, the cities, the space  stations, all of it is created with a new breath and never before attempted  in other movies. I do admit that some of it looks very CG, but most of it  is very well done. Seeing the special effects alone is worth the buying of  a movie. The sound is amazing as well, not Matrix-caliver stuff, but better  then most out there. The whole movie was a thrill ride and brought back  (not as well though) the memories of seeing first Star Wars for the first  time.

666585,5,6303454038,"What can I say? This movie was excellent, but before I go into that, I'll talk mainly about the less-than-excellent parts of the movie. I know when Lucas pictured Jar Jar he mainly had little kids in mind, and that's  admirable that he knows how to capture a wide audience (as if it's hard, I  mean, come on, this is Star Wars!), but if you ask me, Jar Jar recieved a  little too much screen time that could have productively been used on  something more intriguing, like the infamous light saber battles. In my  opinion, you can never get enough of those, there's just something about  them that makes them stand out from the rest of the movie. Maybe it's  because the light saber is the signature tool for Star Wars, and any  hard-core Star Wars fan can never get enough of the light saber battles :).  One other small thing that bothered me was that the pod racing scene was  too long. I know that this was a big factor of the movie, and don't get me  wrong, it was good, but after a while, it just lost its lure.  Now that  that's done, let's get to the good stuff. There's not much I can say,  besides that the rest of the movie was great! The special effects were as  good as anticipated, but everybody already knows that. Some things I  thought that were really good that haven't gotten much attention I'm going  to mention. One is the music, which was very well written and fit the movie  perfectly. Another was the costumes. I don't know what the people at the  Academy were thinking (and don't get me wrong, I'm not exactly the  experienced movie critic-), but the costumes used in Star Wars were truly  unique and deserved that Oscar.  The actors also portrayed the roles well  and appeared to be very real. Quigon and Obi Won were everything I would  have expected and more--they played their parts very well. All in all, I  think this movie was a great beginning to a great saga and I am impatiently  awaiting the release of episodes 2 and 3.",956793600,2,1955,4.391061452513966

This  new movie had none of that- it seemed like these actors were just saying  their lines- nothing else.  I've seen Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman do  great in other movies- why not this one? In one scene- were Anakin and his  mother say their goodbyes- there is no emotion what so ever- and you would  think that a mother that was loosing her one and only child would have  greater emotions then just ""Don't turn around!...what is my next line  Mr. Lucas?""

The computer  generated graphics are a generation ahead of those in the first trilogy,  creating a stunningly detailed and intricate mesh of alien landscapes and  characters.
Liam Neeson is outstanding as Jedi Knight Qui Gon Jin,  portraying a very credible and very human character who sees clearly the  inherent paradox of the Jedi philosophy and the role they must play in a  dangerous time.  Ewan McGregor brings much more personality to the young  Obi-Wan Kenobi than is shown in Alec Guiness' more mature Ben Kenobi.
The  most interesting performance is by the fascinating Natalie Portman.  When  portraying the very proper and regal Queen Amidala, she is almost  stultifying in her cardboard stiffness, but this sterile charaterization  vanishes when she slips into the role of the hand-maiden alter-ego, Padme.  Portman is refreshingly candid and outspoken in this role, without  resorting to the shrewishness of the early Princess Leia depictions.  Those  who have read the books or know the relationship between Padme and the  young Annakin Skywalker will find the subtle interplay between the two  absolutely delightful.
This boxed set contains two wonderful bonuses;  first, of course, is that the movie is in Widescreen format, the only way  that it can be truly appreciated.  Secondly, there is a fascinating  portfolio of original concept drawings that is worth the purchase price in  and of itself.
If you liked The Phantom Menace enough to want to own the  movie, do yourself a huge service and invest a little extra for this  Special Edition.  It will tremendously expand your understanding and  enhance your enjoyment of the entire Star Wars experience.",956793600,4,1872,5.15

2)  sure it is not gonna live up to ten years of hype but come on if you take  episode one and compare it to episode four i think you have a far more  engaging film action wise and you seem to get more invloved....i rememeber  i thought luke was too whiney at the beginning but loved him later...so if  you quit comparing one film to three then maybe you will see what you have  missed.
3) jar jar- was every bit comic relief and enjoyable.so what if  he sound jamacian.jamacian accents are cool and it shows use clumsy people  that us too can accomplish big feats.
4) many adults did not like this  film because of the age of the characters while i admit that is why i did  not praticlarly care for jake lloyd...some parts were overacted...i did  like natalie portman and hopefully with them older in the next film people  will get into there characters more.since people like to go to the movies  and lose themselves..
overall the movie was not a let down once i  surpassed my own hype and let my imagination once again take control.sure  there was some unbelievable stuff but no big deal..in the star wars  universe anything goes..do i have questions about contridictions sure..but  my faith is on lucas he knows what he is doing...so come on i surpassed my  great un realistic expectations can you?",956707200,,2037,4.423180592991914

My recommendation is for this widescreen edition, so  that none of the spectacular scenes and effects are lost.  This film is  kept from a 5 star rating simply by the kid-appeal accent on the silly  Jar-Jar character, which adds too much slapstick to an otherwise  extraordinary sci-fi entry.  The widescreen presen tation is especially  effective in the panoramic shots, the intense laser sabre fights, and the  near-legendary pod race.

I just hope in Episode  2 he goes through puberty and his voice changes and gets hooked on phonics,  because that did bug me.  Everything else was great.  Everytime there was a  lightsabre on screen, the movie ruled.  I've heard people say it was  boring.  If you think this movie is boring, you are not allowed to watch a  movie ever again. To a non Star Wars buff, the movie won't have the full  impact, being that certain clues to the other trilogy won't make any sense.  The pod racing sequence is truly amazing and I just love the sound that  Sebulba's pod makes.  Anyhow, this movie is a lot of fun, and remember it's  supposed to be a children's movie, as were the first three and don't judge  this until Episode 2 and 3 are out so you can watch all 6 on tape  (hopefully on DVD by then).

666696,5,6303454038,"Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace
After all the hype and the crazily varied reviews, the real question is whether The Phantom Menace is up there amongst its' three predecessors as one of the best films of all  time or a pale imitation of its relations. The answer: neither. Phantom  Menace isn't up to standards of Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back or  Return of the Jedi. A millions details irritate and niggle. The acting is  sometimes flat, Jar Jar is irritating and incomprehensible and the plot  adheres to tightly to the conventions of the past films. At one point the  same sequence of events is repeated twice (there is indeed always a bigger  fish) and the force has now been revealed to be a bunch of tiny parasites  who give birth to the chosen one - it kind of loses its mistique doesn't  it! I also feel that the promotional material (and there was a lot of it!)  ruined much of the films' appeal. For example, in the film, Darth Maul only  reveals his two bladed lightsaber at the end of the film, but due to all  the promotion we all knew about it already. So does this all mean that it  was a bad film? Far from it. Although a slight disappointment for a Star  Wars film, in its own right it's bloody excellent. Each of the weaker  performances are matched by great turns from Natalie Portman and Ian  McDiarmid, and, though I could have done without Jar Jar, Anakin's owner,  the other computer animated character in the film, looks and acts  brilliantly and sits next to Palpatine as the best character in the movie.  The lightsaber battles are incredible, and Darth Maul is amazing to watch.  The computer effects, far from detracting from the story, are brilliant to  watch and effective within the plot. The huge council chamber is  particularly notable for being mindblowingly awe-inspiring.  John Barry's  score is powerful and memorable, cleverly both touching on the Star Wars  theme and going in new directions at the same time. The film works best  when the viewer is familiar with the originals, both because of the nods to  events in the future, and because of the sheer sense of excitement when the  Star Wars prolouge scrolls up the screen. So it seems fair to say that this  is not the unfaultable work of art that the other three Star Wars' were,  but it is still one of the best fims I have ever seen. Can't wait for  Episode 2. Hint: watch to the very end of the credits to hear a little  referral of what is to come.

That being said let us look at how people are  most likely perceiving this movie. Can ANYTHING that was as revolutionary  and awe inspiring REPEAT that feat? No. People come to expect too much out  of it. Can anything affect you with the sense of wonder it did when you saw  it when you were 5-15? No. We are so much more impressionable when we are  younger and the wonder that A New Hope presented then was electrifying.

This one was also subtler in its  approach to the force and the political intrigues surrounding the  characters of the story.  It was not so insular as the previously released  movies.

I was too young to be a discriminating viewer. Today, I can see the  original trilogy's shortcomings, and they're similar to the flaws of  ""Phantom Menace"" (dumb dialogue, less-than-rounded-out  characters). The difference was that from 1977-1983, I didn't notice or  care, and this nostalgic filter through which I watch the original trilogy  is what insulates it from critcism. No such filter exists for ""Phantom  Menace,"" and an older, more jaded person is likely to carp on its  shortcomings, especially after all the hype and anticipation. Here are the  weaknesses of ""Phantom Menace,"" as I see them: 1. Jake Lloyd; 2.  Jar Jar Binks; 3. stiff delivery of dialogue (that's the director's fault);  4. Anakin yelling, ""Yippee!"" (what kid says that?); 5. the lack  of an assertive yet funny character (like Han Solo). But the biggest reason  I even care about these things is because I'm too old and jaded now to  appreciate ""Phantom Menace"" for what it is (beneath the glittery,  sci-fi exterior, an old-fashioned Western movie), and be able to view it a  sense of childlike wonder and awe.

Complaints? Sure, I've  got'em. Even with their age-old special effects, the original trio of SW  films were written and executed with pure plot in mind. Lucas himself said  that TPM was written for children, hence the relative simplicity in story  and the lack of any profanity or ""adult themes."" I still don't  understand how it didn't earn a 'G' rating. The events revolving around Pod  Racing (which make up half the movie) and the Power Ranger-like Jedi/Sith  fight scenes are all designed to make the kiddies say ""Whoa  cool!"" Did it bother anyone else that Jar Jar recieved more character  development than Darth Maul? And was I the only person who heard the name  ""Senator Palpatine"" and said ""Oh gee, I wonder what part  HE'S going to play here? ""
But all things considered, when you stop  saying ""Hey, where's the swanky Han Solo character, and why isn't the  Sith guy breathing really deeply?"" and stand Episode 1 next to the  piles of Sci-Fi garbage that make it to theaters every year, things don't  look so bad. TPM towers in many ways over the last few Star Trek films and  blows away such trash as ""Supernova"", the Alien clone,  ""Pitch Black,"" as well as other child-oriented sci-fi/fantacy  films such as Pokemon. This is all, of course, my opinion. I could be  wrong.
PS: Leonardo is NOT staring in Episode II. That rumor was out the  door months ago.

667052,1,6303454038,"Hmmm.  What to say about `The Phantom Menace'?  I waited how many years to see this ""grand vision"" of George Lucas?
I will make this as short, sweet and painless as possible.  Let's start out just by saying this  has got to be THE biggest disappointment in film history.  Mr. Lucas,  claimed on `Episode IV' that there was more to the story to bring us up to  the 1978 masterpiece `Star Wars' (and I'm not talking about the tainted  Special Edition version either.).  With the coming of `Star Wars: Episode I  - The Phantom Menace', this film has proved to me that there was no story  of the sort. I feel that what was once a grandiose, intricately visioned  perception of an outer-worldly saga is now all worth nothing.
`Phantom  Menace' starts out with the traditional mammoth text run.  The almost-holy  yellow letters that grace the screen and flow upward into space accompanied  by the magic theme that millions of people have grown to love.  What could  go wrong...right?  This unfortunately proves to be the best part of the whole  film.  The damage could be seen within a few short moments.  Before we know  it, Ewan McGregor appears on screen as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi and utters  the now famous line, ""I've got a bad feeling about this.""  Well  let me tell you, as I sat in the theater in anticipation,  $10 ticket-stub  in hand, third row from the front, opening night, a tiny voice in my head  whispered, ""So do I, Obi-Wan...So do I.""
With acting bad  enough to make you cry, a COMPLETE lack of plot and absolutely tasteless  ""looky-what-we-can-do"" effects this piece of trash carries on and  on getting worse by the minute forming a self-satire, if you will, a  cartoon of the modern myth Lucas has created thus far. Goofy, English  speaking aliens with ethnic accents and an immaculate-conception `shocker!'  idea for the birth of Anakin Skywalker are just two things that make this  movie flat-out absurd.  `Episode I' quickly develops into a silly, mocking  rendition of what the original three were.  `Phantom Menace' is like a  `Diet Star Wars'. A mini-version of the real `Star Wars' dipped in  undiluted liquid brainlessness, hung out to dry for an hour and sold in a  shrink-wrapped container with a cardboard backing.  A `Star Wars' that I  wish would just admit, ""Just kidding!  This isn't REALLY a full  installment of the best science fiction series ever.""
The Players:
Jake Lloyd trots his dry, barely television commercial-caliber talent as  the young Anakin Skywalker.  A new standard of awful is achieved with his  two-dimensional portrayal of the young boy who eventually becomes the  silver screens' most notorious villain.  Sad.
Liam Neeson is notably  repulsive as Qui-Gon Jin, the Jedi mentor whose force mind-control attempts  never quite work on anyone.  (? )  It makes you wonder, ""Ha, ha, ha!  This isn't really part of the script, ...is it?""
Ewan McGregor solely  puts a worthy performance into his character, the young Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Part of me feels sorry for McGregor though in this case, because from  viewing his effort in this film shows that he has had hope for `Phantom  Menace' throughout production. But now seeing the first nightmarish results  of this movie, he may understand now what the next two episodes will  bring.
Natalie Portman plays the poorly written part of Queen Amidala (or  is it Padme now!  I'm not quite sure!), Anakin's future love-interest, and  future mother of twins Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia.  Um... yeah.
R2D2  and the skinless C3PO make their inevitable appearance and we observe how  they meet. Seeing the familiar duo again made this movie worth not walking  out on.  But their cameos made it clear that Lucas really had no clue where  he wanted this movie to go and thought he would throw them in somewhere to  give the audience some kind of closure with the story.
The 30-some year  younger Yoda is seen in all his high glory.  Yoda seems awkwardly  misdirected in his few scenes.  What, I guess, develops into a highly  intelligent and focused being...well...seems to start out here as a confused  and bewildered (not to mention badly constructed) puppet.  I dunno, you  figure it out.
The cheaply horned and ""lets just throw some paint on  his face"" foe Darth Maul, played by a professional martial artist  I-forget-his-name fights a lot.  The fight scenes are cool...  Yep... that's  about it.
And ahhhhhh who could forget `Star Wars's' worst addition since  the Jabba the Hutt/Han Solo scene in `Star Wars: Special Edition', Jar-Jar  Binks.  What needs to be said about Jar-Jar that hasn't been said already?  All I can say is I would rather have my fingernails ripped out one by one  with pliers than experience Jar-Jar Binks again. What was George Lucas  thinking!  (Um... Did he just say ex-squeeze me?)
--`Episode I' ultimately  collapses into a pile of mindless drivel, insulting the `Star Wars' name  and losing at least my personal faith in hoping for a redemption in future  episodes. With its expensive Saturday morning cartoon-like effects, the  movie fails to be crutched by anything to aid it from self-destruction.  From the yawnable pod race scene to the paper-mache robot army, this movie  has got TERRIBLE written all over it.  George Lucas, the man who brought us  `THX-1138', `American Graffiti' and the flawless `Star Wars' Trilogy has  plopped one of the worst movies ever made into our laps after 16 years in  the waiting.  I would say that `Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace'  is just like any other Hollywood piece of junk being cranked out nowadays,  but I can't, simply because of the huge runway of potential it had to run  on.  What had the best possibility of being the greatest and most loved  science fiction film, resulted in the worst possible execution.  For big  fans, the dawning of `Episode I' is truly that of mourning.  I don't think  I will be buying anymore action figures.",956188800,87,5913,4.825301204819277

667160,5,6303454038,"So I guess it's the ""cool"" thing to trash this movie. Yeah, we know that ""The Matrix"" had better effects...it was also a completely different type of film. Yeah, we know that the acting and  dialogue to Episode I was subpar...have you ever seen the original Star  Wars movies?  They're not exactly the best acted and written movies on the  planet. Here's what I want to see in a Star Wars movie...
1) Cool visual  effects...Ep I has them
2) Cool spaceships...Ep I has them
3) Strange  worlds with weird new creatures...Ep I has them
4) Awesome light saber  duels...Ep I has them
5) Big explosions...Ep I has them
6) Good guys vs  bad guys...Ep I has them
7) Awesome sound fx...Ep I has them
8) John  Williams' exciting score...Ep I has it
Am I looking for ""Citizen  Kane""?  Nope. Am I looking for a film that explains the mysteries of  the universe? Nope. Am I looking for Academy-Award winning acting?  Nope.
I'm looking to be taken away to a place I've never been before. I'm  looking to be shown where this amazing world I fell in love with back in  1977, 1980, and 1983 came from...where it started. I'm looking to have some  fun and have my jaw drop at what I'm seeing and hearing. I got my money's  worth.
I think there are way too many people who feel they have to bash  this movie in order to get revenge on all the hype, which I admit was way  out of hand. They call it a flop. Yeah, $500 million in box office  receipts. What a disaster. What a disappointment. Please!
It's OK, ya  know, you can admit that you liked it. You won't go to hell. You won't be  struck down by lightning. If you call yourself a Star Wars fan, and you  *didn't* think to yourself how cool the ending light saber duels were, or  how awesome the pod race was, then you really aren't as big of a fan as you  think.
It's Star Wars. It's good. And you know you'll be standing in  line when Episode II comes out in a few years. Shut up!",956102400,7,1917,4.240997229916897
667161,2,6303454038,"This installment of the Star Wars saga was a real disappointment. At its best the movie shows us the complexity and limitations of the Jedi, before their fall.  But the real presence of the Force enters the movie through  the boy Anakin. I think the biggest failing is that there is nothing truly  heroic about the plot. The world is saved through a sequence of bizarrely  random events. It's almost laughable, and certainly not heroic. If the  screenwriter had really wanted to equate the force with random chance (and  a positive outcome), there are better ways of communicating this.
Some  other options:
1) The battle is over, the Naboo have lost. All friendly  fighters have been destroyed. When out of nowhere, a huge asteroid suddenly  smashes into the control ship, splitting it in half and sending the  wreckage spiraling to its fiery demise on the planet surface.
2) It's  ""bring your kids to work"" day on the control ship on the day  after the battle has ended. Princess Amidala has been captured and is (down  on the surface) preparing to surrender. Meanwhile, up on the bridge of the  control ship, little Johnny is asking, ""Hey daddy, what does this red  button do?"" Daddy lizard doesn't reply because he is busy watching the  proceedings on his vid screen. So Johnny presses the big red button --  which just turns out to be the control ship's self destruct mode. In the  ensuing confusion the ship's officers are somehow unable to cancel the  self-destruct order (perhaps the override code has been misplaced?) and the  ship is destroyed in a fiery explosion.
The way young Anakin saved the  day just makes me sick to my stomach.",956102400,,1645,4.76241134751773

The star wars trilogy was a hard act to follow and Lucas  succeeded in in almost every way.  The picture quality of the VHS version  was blurry and drab but I suspect this is for reasons of the eventual  release of a THX "" SPECIAL EDITION ""version in the future.  That's it sell them the video two or three times not just once.  I still  think it's worth it even if the picture could be better.",956102400,,625,4.040983606557377
667163,5,6303454038,"This prequel to the Star Wars series is a welcome addition to the hexology. The story is entertaining and fills us in on the early times of characters we know such as Obi-Wan Kanobi and Anakin Skywalker as well as  R2D2 and C3PO. This derivative work is crafted like a jigsaw puzzle where  we already know what the picture looks like in the later episodes, but we  don't have the details on how the pieces all came together.
Even if you  are the only cave dweller on the planet who hasn't seen any of the Star  Wars episodes previously, you won't be disappointed by this film. It stands  on its own as a solid sci-fi action adventure entry.
Critical to the  success of any Star Wars film are the special effects, and in this regard  16 years of technology has moved the art form to new heights. The animation  of Jar Jar Binks, the droid army and the panoramic city scenes with the  hustle bustle of the futuristic cities was mind boggling. The pod race was  a dizzying rocket ride. In every regard, the effects were an improvement  over previous generations.
Liam Neeson was a bit too stoic in the role of  Qui-Gon Jinn, but his performance in the action sequences involving the  light saber were excellent. Neeson has the intensity to play the character  more expressively, so I have to wonder if he was being directed to be more  phlegmatic by George Lucas. Ewan McGregor was excellent as the young  Obi-Wan Kenobi, but I found Natalie Portman to be wimpy and flaccid as  Queen Amidala. Carrie Fisher she ain't. Jake Lloyd was a treat as the young  Anakin. He has a lot of spunk and it will be interesting to see if he can  convert that potential from child phenom to solid actor.
I'm sure I could  pick out little things I wish were different, but this is fantasy  entertainment at its finest, so other than a few weak acting performances I  have to give this film a 9/10 just for sheer enjoyment and marvelous  special effects.",956102400,7,1932,4.485632183908046

The Phantom  Menace starts at the beginning and shows the characters that started the  whole thing.

  Don't go into this movie  thinking every question you have will be solved in a neat little  package,because a surprise will be in store,it doesn't happen. However,by  no means let that stop you from seeing this well above average,almost  great,film. The cast is terrific,and little Jake Loyd is not as bad as some  would have you think.

  I did have one problem with this movie,JarJar. From  time to time I did find him a little annoying,but given the worthiness of  the rest of this film,it was easy to get over my annoyance with JarJar.
  All in all,I think this movie did a fine job of setting up the rest of this  continuing saga. In the end it leaves one wanting to know more and anxious  for the next installment.

What was charming and clunky and even kind of clunky about Lucas' rather forced dialogue has since ossified  into a stilted preaching quality, as the dialogue becomes little more than  exposition.  The attempts at comedy remain mere attempts.  The less said  about JarJar the better.
And if that weren't bad enough, we are expected  to pay more money for a widescreen version than for a pan and scan version!  The widescreen SPECIAL EDITION is merely a scam, and a transparent one at  that.  George Lucas is now clearly interested in one thing, and one thing  only: lining his pockets with money.

The characters however do not  develop enough for us to really grow close to them.  Although Liam Neeson  did a good job of acting and his character probably was the best.  But  characters such as Darth Maul didn't really get much screen time and yet his  seemed the most interesting.  This film draws criticism because it seems  too much geared towards kids.  But keep in mind most of the main characters  are either very young teens or children.  Which is done because the next  film will take place ten years later and will show more maturity and  discipline in all these characters.  Especially Jar Jar and Anakin.

  The  same will be true for the films in the Prequel Trilogy. Episode 1 is an  exciting film, but it will be boring compared to Episode 2.

But I'm also objective.. the acting in Episode 4 is just as  bad, the dialogue is just as cheesey, as anything in Episode I is.  What  did it for us in 1977 was the saga, the special effects, and the subtle  humor that was inherent in the film.
In Episode I, Lucas does include the  same elements, as well as a very similar plot line, as the original Star  Wars was.  The special effects were dazzeling, the action was fast, and  there was a deeper dimention of political intrigue not present in the  original trilogy.
Also, unlike the original trilogy, in which 3 no-name  actors, rough around the edges, churned cheesey dialogue, in episode I we  have two seasoned actors, Liam Neesen and Ewan McGregor (with a brief  appearance of Samuel L. Jackson - whom I look forward to seeing more of in  Episodes 2 & 3), who hold their own.  Remember how much better the  acting seemed in Empire Strikes Back and Jedi?
Do not go in expecting  the original Star Wars.  If you do, you will be disappointed... the raw  quality of a new kind of technology and ""space saga"" is not  there.

People  would actually find it to be a very unique genre of movie.  Its sort of a  scifi/fantasy movie.  People would like it.

667261,4,6303454038,"A:  A few things.
1st- I have never seen a movie on DVD, I own one but it's not attatched to a t.v. in my house(I don't know why).  So I could care less about the debate between the two.
2nd- On the movie cover for  the VHS it is stated that episode one is set only 30 years before the later  three.  How in the world can this be!  In Star Wars(4) Obi-Wan has to be  at least 60-75.  In E1 he is at most 20-25, if not younger.  In retrospect  so is Anakin; we all saw him at the very end of the sixth movie, and he was  old.  Who ever wrote this jacket must have over-looked the original  movies.
3rd- Jar-Jar Binks is not as annoying as people think. I'm 19 and  I found him entertaining.  His whole race added color to an otherwise  totally human movie.  Look at the other three, there were tons of different  species, but in this movie 90% of the characters are human only.  Take out  Jar-Jar's species and you have a boring outer-space movie with nothing but  humans.
4th- Natalie Portman played a rather exceptional role as the  young queen. As the Queen she appeared cold and heartless (except towards  her peeople), which is how queens act.  As Palame she played a loveable  teenager. I know alot of teenage girls who act just like her; she played a  very good part. I guess it helps that she is 18. Jake Lloyd played a rather  convincing 9 year old, seeing how he is one(I mean, were you people ever  kids!).  I can recall fonder and happier days when I would yell  ""yippie! "" at the top of my lungs when happy or excited about  something.
5th- At the end of the movie Palpatine makes reference to  Anakin's abbilities.  He says that they will be watching him in the future.  Does this mean that the Dark Emperor already has plans to make Anakin his  next Sith?
6th- The special effects were good..ok extremely good.
7th- I ""loved"" the new idea that a light-saber can be stuck  into a blast door, and also melt it. I guess the batteries were running low  in the later three movies.  I mean, we never saw that much power from the  light-sabers in the forth, fifth, and sixth movies.  Great idea Lucas, but  in a galaxy far, far away...didn't they have rechargeable batteries.  Take  for example that Obi-Wan took up Qai-Gon's saber after he died, and then in  Star Wars(4) Luke gains access to this same light-saber.  Well, ole Obi-Wan  should of at least told Luke, ""It's not as powerful as it used to  be"", or something.  About all said saber cut through later was Vador's  wrist! I'll bet Darth Vador had this same problem..seeing as how they were  the only ones to use l-bs, and they had to be from the same time  period.
8th- Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menance was the best  movie I saw in 1999, and I didn't have to wait but 5 mintues to get  tickets!  This was on the second day it came out.
9th- It's a good  movie.  Don't read these reviews. Just watch it for yourself...and then  come here and write a review for yourself.
10th- I would actually give  this movie 4 and 1/2 stars, but it wasn't there.  The acting was excellent,  the graphics were out of this world, and the new characters are just  ansestors of our favs from the later 70's and early 80's. I say we all sit  back and enjoy the ride to come.  After all..we do know what happens in the  end.  Now we're just learing the details that lead up to that end.

They actually used some martial arts moves in the fight  scene. I think it would have been more appropriate if a man had taken out  the Starship instead of Anakin Skywalker. Never let a boy do a mans job. If  you want to look at a movie with ugly creatures then this one is for you.  The creatures on the Phantom Menace will make the creatures on Star Trek  look beautiful.

The most noticeable problem is that of  characterisation. The characters are quite soulless and deliver lines in  robotic fasion , lacking the passion of the earlier Star Wars movies . That  said, the pod race and final lightsabre fight in particular are  exhilarating and the movie does retain a Star Wars feel to it.

667403,1,6303454038,"This movie blows. The story is buried under needless sub-plots.  The dialog is cheesy.  The characters are written without emotion.  Most of the acting is stiff.  Lucas directs with a clumsy hand, ending key scenes too  quickly.  The biggest suprise of the movie is the frequency and impunity  with which racial sterotypes are employed.
""Episode I...""  possesses all the telltale signs of a marketing excercise.  It lacks the  creativity, wit, and adventurous spirit of the first three films.  Not  convinced?  Just tool on down to ANY store and bear witness to all the junk  bearing the title ""Episode I.""  Notice the big discount stickers  plastered everwhere. What a shame Lucas spent more time and effort on  merchandising the product than he did on producing a quailty movie.  Why  didn't George release it on DVD?  Simple- there's a greater market for the  VHS format.
Lucas sold out.

When I first saw Star Wars: A New Hope, I had no idea that they were going to make more, and I  don't think George Lucas did either.  All throughout Episode I, they caused  all these problems with the young boy, the return of the Sith, and the  election of Senator Palpatine, but none of these were resolved.  I would  have liked to see a little more substance to a movie than just  foreshadowing.",955756800,,523,4.375
667406,2,6303454038,"I recently saw ""The Phantom Menace"" on video. I had seen it twice at the theatre and thought it was very average. This time around I thought I'd give it another chance. Maybe I was wrong. I wasn't!  This film  is disappointing in so many ways, it's not funny. Don't get me wrong, I  love Star Wars. Saw the first one twelve times when it first came out. Blew  my mind. The main thing that attracted Star Wars to me and my seven year  old colleagues was tho coolness of this film. Not the special effects, but  the cool and more importantly the soul of the film.  What am I talking  about. I'm talking about Han Solo(say no more),Darth Vader, Chewbacca,  Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Millennium Falcon, the Death Star attack. And it kept  getting better!(except for Jedi, enough said)Now we know some of the  characters were a bit annoying. You know who they are. But at least there  was depth to these characters. These ones are just soulless.  There is  hardly any moving moments in the whole film, apart from the key sequence  when Qui Gonn Jinn and Darth Maul are blocked off from each other in the  final light sabre battle. Even when Qui Gonn is killed, there is no sense  of disbelief and it actually makes you think that maybe Liam deserved to  bite the bullet after appearing in this mess. But to be fair, he does come  off the best out of this uneven script with laughable dialogue.  When young  Anni Skywalker has to leave his mother behind on Tattoine, again, I wasn't  deeply moved. Call me cynical, but believe me when I say that the seven  year old boy that fell in love with this space opera, was suddenly on  holiday after the first twenty minutes into the film.  Some people might  say, What about Darth Maul?, he had a presence to be reckoned with. Yeah,  maybe a bit. But the guy had the personality of George Lucas. Tried to be  cool, but we knew that he wasn't. Even Ewan McGregor came off as just a  white version of Kunta Kinte. Yes master,three bags full master. The guy  was obviously bored and who wouldn't be. Stuck in front of a green screen,  talking to a stick.  Now lets talk about another element, that a lot of so  called film makers think that is vital to movie making. The special  effects. I think the more time we distant ourselves from the camera and  taking the film making process into an editing suite, the more we distant  ourselves from the humanity that is tried to be put up there in the first  place(Even if it is a creature from another world)I think The Phantom  Menace is a prime example of this.  For me Phantom Menace was like a bad  cartoon, especially in the war between the Jar Jar Binks brigade and the  federation robots. Boy, I thought the roadrunner was going to pop up  amongst all this animation mess. How silly that would've been. On the other  hand?  All i can say now is to cross you fingers for Episode II. On the  plus side at least, it will have a diffrent director.",955670400,,2923,4.381308411214953

I have seen it several times now and the story is still  interesting it leaves me still wanting to know who is going to win the pod  race as well as thinking I wonder what happens in the next episode.

DVD would add many more pixels to  the screen therefore increasing resolution quality and the sound would  sound so much better if it were off of a digital soundtrack. just imagine  how many extras would be on any star wars DVD....it'd probably take a few  days just to look through it all. and lucas, one who normally DEMANDS that  his films are put in the BEST quality possible....decides NOT to put his  film on DVD but rather vhs, which is basically the worst quality out there.  while it's not a bad movie...actually it is an excellent work of art, but  there's no vhs tape that can do justice to it. all the high resolution  video/audio that the producers went so far to achieve and make possible  gets all but lost in this transition to vhs tape.

Lucas' main mistake was  trying to fit too much in to too little time. 3/4 of the viewers couldn't  absorb it all. At one point he had 4 battles going on at the same time!

667504,1,6303454038,"I'm one of the biggest Star Wars fans, but The Phantom Menace is an undisputable sign that Lucas has lost his mind completely. All of the mistakes of Return of the Jedi are magnified 10x. Obviously, he lives in a sad fantasy world where making more money from Pepsi tie-ins is more  important than quality film making.
George: Star Wars and Empire were  targeted at a 12 year old audience. That audience is now 30. Don't make  another movie aimed at 5 year olds. You'll make more money and earn some  respect if you think about what your FANS want rather than what YOU want.  The production of this movie was, at best, a weak attempt.
Here  are just some of the reasons why I think this film stinks:
1. Horrible  dialog: Lucas had 15 years and plenty of talented writers- look at what he  decided to film.
2. Bad. Bad acting: If you're going to use newcomers,  there are plenty of good actors trying to get work.
3. Bad, bad  directing: Rotten Direction + Rotten Acting = Phantom Menace. How about  some depth to the characters? Focus on developing 3 good characters, not 8  stupid ones!
4. Canned Special Effects: We've seen it all before. People  don't want to see computer generated characters, unless its Toy Story.  Check out the Matrix for some true quality effects.
5. Stupid STUPID  jokes and way too many of them: Fart jokes, ""how rude?"", Jar-Jar.  These used to be serious movies. George, do you understand the  ""relief"" in comic relief? Keep it down to 2%, OK?
OK, Now the  good bits:
1. Excellent light saber fights
2. Cool political story (yet  badly portrayed)with Senator Palpatine's manipulation of power.
3. Decent  performances by Liam and Ewan - oh, the value of real ACTORS!

The actions that take place in the background are the  most detailed special effects you'll ever see. Widescreen is the only way  to go. I have seen both versions and the pan & scan loses to much. Pure  action satisfaction. Don't miss out. Gearge has said that all 6 episodes  will be in a DVD box set but not until christmas of 2005. The VHS is well  worth the purchase.

Set to the wonderful atmosphere  conjured by John Williams' Duel of the Fates, I found it engaging to a  whole new level.
While some people may find the romantic overtones  between young Skywalker and Amidala to be unnerving, it is necessary to set  the stage for that plot line to be further develop in Episode II and III.  I mean we all KNOW how it ends up right!",955584000,,625,4.228813559322034

Boring, unintelligent, a huge  let down from the ""original three"" George better clean up his act  before Star Bores Episode II: The Return of Jar Jar",955584000,5,692,4.829059829059829
667508,5,6303454038,"When I saw Star Wars Episode 4 in 1977, I came away a lot different from most fans. However, nobody ever knew just how different; until now. My hero was not Han Luke Obiwan or Leia. My hero was the Tragic Darth Vader.  Everybody else were expounding the virtues of their MAINSTREAM hero, while  I? I had to be silent. NOBODY was going to accept the fact that I picked  Darth Vader - WHAT BROUGHT Vader to his tragic enmeshment with the Dark  Side? In my mind, I secretly thought that there HAD to be a MUCH BIGGER  STORY behind Vader - What prompted him to fall to the Dark Side? Then in  episodes 5 and 6 I watched Vader's story in the end save his son from the  Emporer. I had been vindicated! Anakin Skywalker's son was right about his  father - There was a conflict within. There was a small part still  enlightened with good. And In Episode 1, I learn that Anakins' path was  deeply enmeshed in the Light side of the Force. Anakin IS THE CHOSEN ONE  WHO WILL BRING BALANCE TO THE FORCE...at a tragic cost to Anakin himself,  which I assume will be fleshed out in episodes 2 and 3. I heard that only  C3PO and R2D2 were the only characters in all the movies. However, I  believe this is Anakin Skywalkers STORY - Star Wars - as he ALSO is in all  the episodes. Episode 1 continues Anakin's Story, From the very start. It  is truely a great movie. Anakin Skywalker, the FORCE made FLESH!",955584000,,1390,4.248091603053435
667509,4,6303454038,"I remember well the feeling I had watching the opening sequence to Star Wars nearly 25 years ago, Princess Leia's ship being chased by a gigantic star cruiser. Well I have been hooked ever since and despite some of the  criticism that the Phantom Menace has received, it looks as if I am going  to be hooked for the next 25 years!
The first three Star Wars films (i.e.  up until the 'first' Star Wars movie) are all about Anakin Skywalker and  how he comes to bring balance to 'the force'. This film cleverly introduces  him as a small boy: a wizard pilot and at electronics (it is he who builds  C3PO) and lays the foundation for all the events we know that are to come.  We are told that he sees things before they happen and that he has no  father (he is the product or a virgin birth). We observe the way that is  relationship with Queen Amidala develops (who I assume he marries later)  and are given an inkling of the fear that will make him turn to the dark  side.
It is all here. I have watched this four times since I got the  video and each time I find another piece that fits into the puzzle that is  George Lucas' grand scheme. Just watch for the way that R2D2 is introduced  to the story.
There is much more to this film than the effects (which  although we now take for granted are still wonderful to watch), Darth  Maul's evil grace and the pod race and Ewan McGregor's accent are just  examples.
The story provides a great backdrop to the characters: the Jedi  are summoned to resolve a conflict between Naboo and the Trade Federation,  the Sith are behind an intricate political manouvre to take over the  Council (yes I do belive that Senator Palpatine is indeed Darth Sidious who  becomes the Empreror). Naboo wins through the bravery of its queen and but  Senator Palpatine becomes leader of the Council. The goodies appear to have  won, but all is not what it seems.
Everything is being set up for the  next instalment. Obi Wan being allowed to train Anakin, the death of Darth  Maul leaving an open place for Darth Vader and the relationship between  Amidala and Anakin as the first step towards Luke Skywalker.
This is a  truly wonderful story and I admit that I am totally caught up with it. I  cannot wait for Episode 2 and in the meantime can satisy myself with repeat  playings of the 4 episodes I have.

The scenery is quite  breathtaking as well as the special effects, but it's the displacement that  put off most fans: imagine being treated to your most beloved story, but  only with the well-known characters completely removed and thus replaced by  total strangers. You'll get used to it in time, nevertheless. But some of  the characters are a good pick, in my opinion. Despite her weirdo hairdos,  the pubescent young queen turns out to be a pretty intriguing character  with her headstrong determineness and despite what everyone said about the  young Anakin Skywalker, I really think he's a little cutie and I bet he  would break hearts when he grows up, which you will get to witness in the  upcoming movie this summer. And the climax is really ASTONISHING and just  plain cool!

Action, adventure, nobility, and a little tug on the heart--the formula for a truly memorable film.  And perhaps I would have  been overwhelmed by its sheer magnitude as I sat watching it from my tiny  seat in the theater, if I were ten years old. The writers were way, way too  generous with the comic relief, throwing in a juvenile element or two  wherever they felt the plot was lack.  In which case, they must have felt  the same as I; it slacked off quite a bit.  Jar Jar Binks and his entire  ridiculous clan would have been better left at the drawing board.  I found  their behavior annoying and felt that Lucas shouldn't have taken off  running with the old imbecile sidekick bit. Darth Moul was definitely not  menacing.  His painted face and false horns did nothing to mirror the  mystery surrounding the Great Darth Vader of the Star Wars Trilogy. I was  glad to see a few familiar faces such as Jabba the Hut and R2D2, but Yoda,  the most memorable character of the first three episodes, seemed out of  place in the urban setting.

Other than that, this movie is  a wonderful prelude to the entire Star Wars saga.",955497600,,497,4.020408163265306

A man who earns so much money, is only interested in making more profit. He could have  released the LD at least in the US to satisfy those who have a LD-Player  and not the Japanese Version with Subtitles but nevertheless, for everyone  who wants to experience the real Star Wars feeling, they have to wait until  Spring 2006.

Star Wars and THX are synonymous with one another.  Star Wars means  digital, 5.1 sound and awesome video clarity.  You can not experience this  with the analog VHS release.  It's a shame that the movie industry thinks  it can make us wait on their terms.  I remember when the movie mongers who  made the Titanic tried to do the same thing.  And when they released the  the DVD version I chose not to buy it.  Let them suffer and eat the loss.  Again send a message to Mr. Lucas and make ""him"" wait instead.",955411200,6,658,4.168

I know that Jar-Jar was in the movie for the younger audience, but I thought he was funny. He also by  far did not ruin the movie. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor did an excellent  job on acting. They both had to act like they were talking to Jar-Jar when  he wasn't even really there. That just shows you how good of actors they  are, though Ewan didn't do as good as Liam. Natilie Portman did a good job  and so did Jake Lyold, but he can't act as good as the boy in The Sixth  Sense, but he still did a good job. The guy who played Darth Maul( I think  his name is Ray Park) was so cool. Instead of just standing there and  fighting like Darth Vader in the previous Star Wars, Darth Maul is doing  all these moves with his lightsaber and doing flips in the air that are  amazing. I bet it took a lot of practice for Liam, Ewan, and Ray to do the  lightsaber duel at the end of the movie, since Ray had to teach the two  first. I just wish Darth Maul was in the movie more. The special effects  are just about the best I've ever seen in a movie, with great character and  landscape detail. The critics don't know what there talking about, and you  people complaining need to just sit down and enjoy it.

Since when?),  not to mention some moments that are entirely too silly for this noble  saga.  (When I saw Boss Nass do that lip-shaking thing, for example, I  groaned, ""This is obscene."")  But I'm still giving this movie  four stars, simply because it does have its moments:  the unbelievable  special effects, for example, that turn this from a movie into a  breathtaking epic experience.  Add to that the performances of Liam Neeson  and Ewan McGregor (who sounds exactly like Alec Guiness, by the way), who  give solid performances as true Jedi Knights--highly skilled warriors who  follow a strict code and uphold their principles to the end.  Their  performances alone transform this movie from the rambunctiousness of  previous Star Wars episodes (or later ones, I guess) into a heroic tale of  camaraderie from a time when Jedi Knights were exactly that.  This film  feels old-school even though it's new, and that feeling along with the  background info this movie provides (not to mention what is hands-down the  most kickass series of lightsaber sequences EVER) make this movie worth  owning.",955411200,2,1290,5.180487804878049

667761,4,6303454038,"Yeah I know, yet another Phantom Menace review. It seems like since the movie was released on video the whole TPM Rules/TPM Blows debate has started up on the net again. I just felt like writing my own feelings on  the movie after reading everyone else's.  People seemed to have very mixed  emotions about this movie. Some people love it, hailing it a modern day  masterpiece. Others seem to think it's the biggest piece of crap to ever  grace a movie screen.  I myself enjoyed the movie a great deal, I even own  the collector's edition video now. Is it the best movie ever made? No. Is  it the best movie of 1999? No. Is it even the best of the Star Wars movies?  No. In my opinion that would be Empire Strikes Back. However this is still  a highly entertaining movie.  The special effects are among that best I  have ever seen, they are definitely the star of this movie. The Pod race,  Coruscant, the senate chamber the battle between the Gungans and Battle  Droids, the space battle, the light saber duel, they are all simply  amazing.  The story, which many people have complained about, is  actually in my opinion a very good one. People have to remember that this  movie is a set up for 5 more episodes. I think the movie does a good job of  introducing us to this galaxy far, far away. It's not simply a movie about  ""a trade dispute"", as some of the critics have been saying. It's  about how one man is using a trade dispute to manipulate his way to power,  and on the other hand we have a Jedi Knight's discovery  of a young boy who  he believes will fulfill the prophecy of bringing ""balance to the  force"". I think the critics of this movie will definitely appreciate  it more in 2005 when they will see how important TPM is to the over all  Star Wars Saga.  Despite what some people may say about the acting, I  felt we had some very good performances. Liam Neeson as Qui Gon Jinn, and  Ian Mcdirmid as Palpatine/Sidious put on stellar performances. Ewan  Mcgregor also did a very
good job, and I see big things to come for him  in the next two episodes. People say Natalie Portman's acting was  ""stale"". She was playing royalty, this is how they act. She  really didn't do as bad a job as people say she did. Jake Lloyd has been  given a hard time, but give the kid a break. He's was like 9 years old when  he made the movie. I think he worked very well in the role of the innocent  young slave boy (and who when they were young never yelled out  ""Yippie!"" or ""YAY!""? I know I have).  Now onto the  infamous Jar Jar issue. Some love him, some despise him. I've been on both  ends of the spectrum with him. I didn't like him really the first time I  saw the movie, but after seeing it a few more times the guy grew on me. Now  I can say I've done a 180, and I actually laugh the Gungan's antics. Give  the guy a chance, he will grow on you.  So to all the critics out there  I just have this to say. Try to forget all the hype this movie had. As hard  as it may be, don't compare it to the original trilogy. Just watch it for  what it is, a highly entertaining adventure movie that is setting up a  really great saga.",955411200,,3131,4.19023569023569
667762,2,6303454038,"There isn't much to be said. So what if it wasn't relesed on DVD? The point is that this move lacked what the others had. The plot and characters (especially the Jar-Jar tibe) were more than a bit shalow, the acting  wasn't great, and the script was terible. ""I'm so proud of you  Anne"" Annican's mother sqeaks in an unnaturally high voise after he  wins the pod race. ""you have given strength to those who have  none.""  Oh please! If Lucas works more on the plot, script and  characters next time, they might live up to the originals.",955411200,,535,4.408163265306122
667763,4,6303454038,"I, like probably everyone else who loves Star Wars, was instantly swept up into the hype of The Phantom Menace. After the 12:01 a.m. showing I thought it was the best Star Wars flick to date, now I think it's pretty good. The  Empire Strikes Back is still my number one. The plot has been discussed  enough, everyone has seen the movie, the DVD war wages on, so I thought I'd  add my technical specs and observations. There was no way I wanted to spend  thirty dollars on the widescreen (I don't even like the black bars, I don't  care how much ""extra"" stuff you can see on the sides) so I have  the pan and scan. I really don't see what the fuss is all about. It's not  that bad in my opinion.
I've got a nineteen inch television that's about  nine years old and a VCR just over one year old. I don't see the washed or  faded colors. The picture is nice, sharp, and vibrant on my TV. I've got my  VCR hooked up to my 300 watt Aiwa surround system and the music, sound, and  effects are just awesome. Now only if I had a bigger TV....
As far as  Return of the Jedi getting worst picture status next to TPM, there's just  no way. Even with the Ewoks, I've never seen a cooler scene in a movie  (that gives me chills everytime) than the lightsaber duel between Darth  Vader and Luke nearing the end. Price of admission right there  folks.
Overall I still like The Phantom Menace a lot. None of the Star  Wars movies can be considered thinking or deep movies. They're fun and  entertainment and based on those two criteria they all do  wonderfully.
Enjoy, and may the force be with you.",955411200,,1583,4.234113712374582
667764,4,6303454038,"After a long 16 year wait, the world was brought back to that galaxy far, far away.  What a homecoming!  It was unfortunate The Phantom Menace was overhyped and held to impossibly high expectations which led to a mountain  of, in my opinion, unfair criticisms from a society that is quick to tear  anything good down.  Episode 1 is a fantastic film that carries on the  magical tradition of the Star Wars series.  Although slightly thin in some  character development and background (e.g. Chancellor Valorum played by  Terrence Stamp), the film has a rich, intricate story that entertains on  many levels.  The performances of the cast were great all around:  Liam  Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Hugh Quarshie, Samuel  L. Jackson, and Ian McDiarmid, who was fantastic in the role of Senator  Palpatine (the true phantom menace!).  The special effects were truly  fascinating, from the exciting and harrowing pod race to the grand  cityscape of Coruscant.  The film is a wonderful journey that maintains the  magic which captured my heart as a boy over 20 years ago and still  captivates me today and hopefully forever.  Truly the best version to have  is the widescreen edition which presents the film in its original grand  scale, as it has done with the classic trilogy.  However, I also purchased  the pan & scan version to get a closer look at the details of many of  the scenes.  I do share the ever growing view of having the Star Wars films  released on DVD as soon as possible.  The DVD format would dramatically  enhance the quality of viewing of these cinematic treasures.  Perhaps the  classic trilogy will be released on DVD soon to whet the appetites of fans  until 2006 or so when the prequel trilogy would be completed. The Phantom  Menace is a truly remarkable movie I highly recommend.  Grab up this  wonderful film today!",955411200,,1861,4.812101910828026
667765,4,6303454038,"OK, Jar-Jar may be a little irritating to us adults, but as a parent of 5 boys (ages 6 mo. to 11 years), Jar-Jar brings much needed lightness to a fairly dark tale. Just when you think the Jedi are going to die, Jar-Jar  shows up and gives the kids some breathing room.
I think that this will  be as much a classic to my 11 year old, as the original Star Wars Episode  IV was to me. I stood in line for  4 hours in 1977 to see it for the first  time, and waited 2 hours last year to see it with my boys.
My only  complaint is the muddiness of the soundtrack with regards to the voices. It  was muddy in the theatre, and is muddy at home. You think that Lucas with  his THX system would get it right on one of his films. Come on, Skywalker,  Use the Force.",955324800,,755,3.8506493506493507

Or any other fight in  the movie.  JarJar can be anoying, but if you don't like him that much  fastforward!  And one more thing, There will not be a DVD for a long long  time, Live with it.

667768,4,6303454038,"I was anticipating this film six months before the movie came out in theatres and I went to see the movie on the second day it came out. I was sort of disappointed when I was comparing it to the original movies (which  in my opinion are the best movies ever!). But then I bought the movie on  tape (where's the DVD?) and I watched it a couple times and realized that  it was better than I thought! Yes there are flaws, and in my view here's  the only drawbacks in the movie. . .
-Jake Lloyd had some very weak lines  in the movie(example- when Greedo said that little Anakin can go home after  he cleans the shelves and Anakin says: ""Yipee!"" What? That's  horrible!)
-During the pod racing scene the two headed announcer- too  ludicrous for words!
-Very little character development! The original  movies were crammed pack with character development and that's what made  them so great! But The Phantom Menace has very little.
-But the biggest  disappointment is that Darth Maul is shown very little in this movie, I was  expecting him to be a large part like Darth Vader in the original  films.
There's also some advantages though!
-There's some great  characters in this movie! I loved Queen Amadala, Darth Maul, and yes. . .  Jar Jar Binks.
-There were great special-effects and  sound-effects!
-The lightsaber fight was awesome! Way better than the  ones in the original films!
-Queen Amadala's costumes were just awesome!  They stole the scene everytime!
So, thought that The Phantom Menace was  pretty good! So, try not to compare it to the other movies because it's  pretty good by itself. And after you think about it, this is a good start  because it has questions to answer and after the next three films come out  you'll see that this was a good start for the new trilogy!

Granted, the movie it self is 3 stars or more, but the VHS tape is not worth buying at all and disgraces the movie even further (having Jar-Jar contribute the  most to it's shame). George Lucas, why are you wasting everyone's time with  such substandard media? Trying to sell us the VHS tape of SW:PM makes  yourself and all of LUCAS INDUSTRIES look like penny pinchers.

667832,2,6303454038,"""Disappointed"" is the best word I can use when I think about how I felt when I saw ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"". ""Disappointed"" because when I saw the first ""Star Wars""  movie 23 years ago (! ), I was enchanted by the characters as much as I was  thrilled by the special effects, which, by the way, would now be considered  pretty cheesy! There is no doubt that the special effects in ""The  Phantom Menace"" are absolutely spectacular. However, along with the  whoop-de-doo effects, I really wish that George Lucas had included some  characters that might appeal to members of the audience who are over the  age of fourteen! Someone, for instance, along the lines of Harrison Ford's  Han Solo character in the first 3 movies. Unlike the first 3 movies, which  I saw several times in the theater and umpteen times on television and  video, this one is really not up to previous standards in terms of how an  adult might enjoy it. And, by the way, when ARE the first 3 movies going to  be released on DVD?",955324800,,1005,4.49171270718232
667833,2,6303454038,"If you can for a moment look at The Phantom Menace as just another film, how does it hold up?  Imagine removing the ""Star Wars: Episode One"" from the title.  And pretend the original three films were never  released?  What do you have left?  In my opinion, a cheesy sci-fi flick.  Not the worse film ever made.  Nor the best.  Just a fair, harmless  sci-fi/fantasy flick with geeky dialogue, an non-sensical story, cheesy  acting & lame kiddie humor.  Sounds like just about every science  fiction movie ever made.  ""Phantom"" reminds me of the worse Star  Trek movies (Star Trek V for example).
Of course, you can't just see  Phantom as 'just another movie.' Because the original three Star Wars  movies weren't simply movies, they were something really special.  The  sense of adventure, fun & excitement the firt trilogy is unforgettable.  Plus, the films captured the audience imagination & loyalty, something  only few films do.  So under that precedenct, this latest Star Wars movie  falls way short.
There's an old saying ""you can never go home  again,"" and I think this movie proves it.  The original trilogy of  films were a mark in time: pure genius & truly classic.  Nobody plans  on greatness, and the success of those films were almost accidental.  Everyone (including George Lucas) thought the film would flop and be  ridiculed.  Nobody predicted it would become a worldwide phenomenon.
And like ""Caddyshack II,"" ""New Coke,""  ""Godfather III"" and the Beatles' ""Free as a Bird,""  Phantom Menace fails to capture the spontainety, ingenuity & emotional  impact of the original.  Granted its a tough act to follow, and I admire  Lucas nerve to actually attempt to follow three of the best loved movies of  all time.  Maybe he should of simply left well enough alone.
The  reviews I've seen about Episode One are very extreme.  People either  rabidly love it and think its the best movie every made.  Or people  viciously hate it, saying that it irrevocably harms the Star Wars saga  & is the worst film in history.  I think this proves that for the Star  Wars universe has become cult-like and like a secret society.  Where its  hardcore fans live, breath & eat this stuff.  Millions of people have  looked to these films to provide meaning to their lives.  Or for some  people it has become their lives.
There's a danger in becoming too  absorbed in something.  And I think the Star Wars fan base has almost grown  out of control.  I'm not one of those people who say, ""these are just  movies, get a life.""  Because I don't believe the original trilogy  where ""just movies.""  They are classic films, great memories of a  time long gone & gave millions of people pleasure.
However, that  moment can never be re-captured.  Phantom Menace tries to but doesn't.  And  episodes 2 and 3 won't live up to the hype either.  Lightning doesn't  strike the same spot twice.  Your best bet if you are a diehard Star Wars  fan is to avoid these films.  Don't look for deeper meaning or a key to  life.
And for the general movie going public, put this one right up  there with ""Star Trek V,"" ok to skim through when its rerun on  HBO or the USA Network, but not worth much else.  Bad movies get made all  the time.  What makes this one so special or worth all this fuss and  debate?  I'm not saying the people on both sides of the fence need to  ""let go and move on.""  I'm saying, ""don't watch the film.  Don't go back and see it 14 times. Don't buy the video or DVD or  widescreen.""  Vote it out.  Send George Lucas and co. a message:  either make a good Star Wars film that at least is in the spirit of the  original films, or don't bother at all.
He'll never get the message if  his films keep making a billion dollars world wide and 50% of his fan-base  keeps talking about how he can ""do no wrong.""  Its up to the  movie going public.  Fight the urge and quit viewing Episode One!",955324800,4,3880,4.534306569343066

But let's face it, folks: if someone  doesn't know better than to dedicate their lives to expecting a movie  sequel, that's their own problem. Episode I may have been surrounded by a  hype that raised the expectations of fans too high and got heavily on the  nerves of those who never cared much for the original Star Wars in the  first place, but it's not such a disastrously bad film.
All right, the  story is pretty illogical and Lucas has probably written some of the worst  dialogue in the movie history. When I first saw the film in movies,  McGregor's line ""I have a bad feeling about this"" teased a  genuinely hilarious reaction out of the audience - the problem is, it  hardly was intended as funny. Similarly, Jar Jar Binks who assumably was  supposed to take care of the comedy department never managed to break the  ice, and it seems the general opinion wished for a special edition with  this character erased by the same computer effects that created it. Talking  of which, why are Qui-Gon's and Obi-Wan's clothes dry when they enter the  Gungan city having just swam through the lake surrounding it? And why  doesn't Qui-Gon's cloak burn when he forgets to switch off his light-saber  before putting it back to his belt?
But if you manage to turn off your  inner movie critic for a moment and choose to go for a couple of hours of  good entertainment instead, it's great fun. Natalie Portman as Queen  Amidala and Jake Lloyd as young Anakin Skywalker may not assure us as a  couple, but their individual performances are enjoyable, as is Liam  Neeson's as Qui-Gon Jinn. For fans of Ewan McGregor there is not much -  maybe the time will come in Episode II. The special effects are beautiful,  the action entertaining (especially the breathtaking pod-race sequence) and  the adventure is still there, as it was in the previous films; it still  invokes the childlike pleasure in the viewer, this fairytale universe.
The strength of Star Wars has never really been in great storylines or  witty dialogue, but in the ability to create a whole and complete universe  with its own mythology, heroes and heroines. It appeals to something that  is very deep within us - the truth is that storytelling and mythologies  have existed in some form in almost every single culture ever known.
If  you're expecting an incredible experience that will change your life, don't  bother. Be realistic: it's just a film. But it should rather be judged by  its own achievements than the expectations created partly by the fan cult  around the original Star Wars and partly by the huge marketing machinery  around it. Be open to it and you might find the force is still with you.",955324800,,2852,4.670020120724346

The movie is a good start for the next movies of the series. I think the visual  effects were great. I can tell a lot of imagination and creativity went  into the scenary. Jar Jar wasn't that bad either. The actors were o.k. The  light saber fight at the end was really hype. I like the movie overall.

Especially in the pod racing scene.  My only complaint about the film is the acting by Jake Lloyd. He did not  put any feeling in his words.

I've read the reviews and only have a couple things to say...Those people whom were dissappointed...remember one thing...many of us were young when the  original Star Wars episodes came out. To us...nothing could surpass  them...they are immortal. The thing to understand is that our children will  enjoy this updated work as we did the originals. I watched this with my son  and was completely spellbound by the way he was drawn into the movie...as I  was with Star Wars episode IV. This movie bridged a gap between me and my  son....Finally a movie we could enjoy together. As for Ja Ja...did anyone  ever think he was put there to draw a child's attention...like the Ewolks  in VI. My son thought he was hysterical...and if you pay close attention he  has a Bill Cosby quality about him...(the dentist joke from Bill Cosby  Himself). For those that were too busy nit picking...I feel sorry for  you...every gesture in this movie...every glance and smile, was leading to  something greater. You're going to look foolish when the whole of this work  unfolds...and then you'll have to watch this again to understand  everything...
I was entirely pleased with this movie...it served as a  fantastic step in the process of the masterpiece that has become a legend  and has brought a new audience with it. I can't wait to sit in anticipation  with my son and see what will unfold in Episode II...Enjoy the movie...and  remember to those of us here from the beginning...nothing can replace the  reverence we found in Episodes IV, V, and VI...but isn't it nice to know  that we have the ability to share that with our children...Finally a movie  that will draw them into the others so they can see it as we saw  it...without automatically thinking...oh great, another old movie that mom  and dad want me to watch.",955238400,,1854,4.779179810725552

I never thought I'd buy a VHS movie ever again since buying a  DVD player last year, but I had to make an exception this one time.  The  picture quality was definitely washed out on my copy. The sound was not  good by any means (i.e., compared to a DVD with a good Dolby 5.1 encoding),  and if you saw it in the theater, you know what kind of awesome sound it  had. As for the movie itself, basically it gets 3 stars from me. While it  wasn't terrible, it had some bad acting and Lucas introduced the most  idiotic and annoying character to probably ever grace the silver screen,  Jar-Jar Binks. Also, for those of you out there who expected  ""more,"" realize this is basically laying the foundation for the  whole Star Wars saga.  They aren't going to reveal and show everything in  this Episode 1, but rather introduce the viewer to characters and  situations that with the other two upcoming Episodes, will be expounded on  further.  Those of you waiting for this along with the other Star Wars  movies to be released on DVD, I hope you're not holding your breath.  I  have read that Lucas is NEVER going to release them on DVD, as he is  supposedly waiting for a better format to showcase them on.  I am not aware  of any such format even being talked about at this time to be the successor  to the already wildly popular and excellent current DVD format.  Now, who  knows, the guy might catch a clue and release it on DVD, but my attitude  regarding this is I'm expecting the worst, hoping for the best.  Has anyone  noticed that Spielberg hasn't released his Indiana Jones Trilogy and also  Jaws on DVD?  He supposedly wants to wait for the ""right time""  or something stupid like that.  Why?  They just released a remastered  Digital VHS version of the Indy trilogy, if that's not heresy, I don't know  what is!

One unforgettable character is Jar Jar Binks and  the role he plays in helping Queen Ambadala regains her throne on her  planet Baboo .The highlight of the film is Pod races and the final climatic  battle in space and on the ground battle on BaBoo The special effects are  great and Liam Neeson as Qui Gon Jin is superb.

668020,4,6303454038,"Like many other fans, I hate how ""kiddified"" this series has become. First Lucas decides that Endor should be populated with Ewoks rather than Wookies in RotJ. Then comes Phantom, and Lucas no longer has  Han, Lando and the rest of the crowd to keep the audience entertained, so  he throws in Jar-Jar, who's purpose seems to be to walk into things, making  funny noises in the hope of eliciting a laugh. That vented, it was still a  decent movie.
I don't care that the film lacked some of the feeling of  grandeur that 4, 5, and 6 had; it wasn't supposed to be about saving the  universe, it was supposed to be a setup for it (ever notice that there's a  ""1"" in Episode 1)? There was awesome music and special effects,  and the lightsaber duel and the pod racing scene were superb. Admittedly,  the movie did take a bit too long building up to the race, that part needed  some trimming. I also have a hard time believing that a Jedi council that  seems to do nothing but sit around all day making funny faces at one  another can be all that wise, and I caught absolutely no hint of the  Darkness hidden in Anakin, nor a single tear as the kid said goodbye to his  mother. He just seemed like a very poor actor.
Still, these are minor  gripes in comparison with the thrill I get watching most of the movie.  Maybe if people didn't kill their imaginations they would enjoy it more.",955238400,,1379,4.328125

Hasn't Lucas made enough  money?
All the DVD owners out there -- wait until Lucas pulls himself  together, and releases it on DVD, otherwise you're going to pay twice for  the same movie -- cause it is going to be released on DVD at some point.
The funny thing is, Lucas' official excuse for not releasing  ""Phantom Menace"" on DVD, is because the quality of DVD doesn't  provide the quality he thinks his movie deserves. Well, last time I  checked, DVD was far superior to VHS, both in terms of video and sound  quality. But maybe that's just me (and every single hi-fi magazine in the  world)?
Enough said, as for the movie itself, I think it was overrated,  and of course, seriously hyped. Of course it has a lot of great visual  effects, etc. but that doesn't make a movie alone. All in all, it's an okay  movie, though.

Lucas sold out for this movie.  The other movies were made for  teenagers and adults.  This movie was made for children.  There is waaay to  much comedy in it.  Portman did a terrible job acting and the main bad  guy's costumes (trade federation) looked terrible.  And they couldn't scare  a mouse.

668028,3,6303454038,"George Lucas has like every other director in the USA, bowed to comercialism. The Phantom Menace was made, first and foremost, to make money and attract a big audience. Queen Amidala, Darth Maul, and Jar Jar  Binks all looked like they had been made with action figures in mind. Lucas  also threw in many characters from the original trilogy that contributed  nothing to the film, like C-3PO and R2-D2. Perhaps the worst attempt to  attract an audience, namely kids, was the casting of Jake Lloyd as Anakin  Skywalker. Terrible!
The special affects in the film were stunning,  creating beautiful city-scapes and underwater worlds. Unfortunately, Lucas  overdid it. The sea mosters in the underwater scenes look like they were  made out of legos, and the CGI characters Jar Jar Binks and Watto look like  cartoons. Lucas made the sad mistake of using special affects as a means to  an end, rather than a tool. On the plus side, the pod race and the battles  at the end were thrilling.
Overall, the Phantom Menace is a typical  modern action-adventure film, made to make money, not to be timeless or  thought provoking. The Phantom Menace has some good material, but lacks the  magic that the original trilogy had. Only buy it if you're a die-hard Star  Wars fan.",955238400,2,1261,4.8

Watching the Academy Awards, I was disappointed that it wasn't recipient of a special effects award. The  special effects are one of the highlights of the film, as are all Star Wars  films. The plot, contrary to popular opinion, is excellent. The plot is  appropriate for a prequel. Episode I tells the origin of the Force, the  Jedi, the Sith and we see an innocent Darth Vader as a boy. Pay attention  to what some of the characters say. They foreshadow future Star War events.  For example, Anakin says, ""I had a dream I was a Jedi and I freed all  the slaves,"" or Palpatine, ""We will watch his career with great  interest."" The acting is well-performed, particularily impressive is  Natalie Portman's role as the bold and intelligent Queen Amidala. Liam  Neeson's role as Qui Gon is equally ensemble. If you get this film, buy the  soundtrack. John Williams has done it again. Spectacular scenery, the  Pod-Race is unforgettable, and the action (light-sabre duels) have been  mastered to an art. For those faithful to the original Star Wars films and  feel the new are ""just for kids"" or for a ""younger  generation"" you are wrong. Pay attention to the dialogue.

Having gone to the theater four times last summer to see it, the video purchase was a given. However, the  experience just isn't the same. Watching at home, I was able to analyze the  film's problems, most notably some exceptionally silly dialogue(the one  that really sticks out is the Jake Lloyd as Anakin ""The biggest  problem in this universe is that no one helps each other"" line). There  are some talented actors here- Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn and Ewan  MacGregor's Obi-Wan are fine, but Natalie Portman's constant wardrobe  changes detract from her performance(what's with the Queen's British accent  and Padme's American dialect?).Jake Lloyd, is, well, raw. One must wonder  what Haley Joel Osment could have done with that role. On the plus side,  the lightsaber battle with the two Jedi versus Darth Maul was fantastic.  Too bad Lucas didn't want to keep Maul around for Episode II. The pod race  is nifty as well, although not as refreshing on the small screen. There's  also too much going on at the end with an uninspired space battle, a  childish sequence involving the Gungans and the Trade Federation Battle  Droids, and the aforementioned(but very cool) lightsaber duel. Yes, the  special effects are well done, but there's nothing in the film that makes  you say ""How'd they do that?"" And this whole situation with no  DVD in the near future. Why, George, why? After five viewings, I've seen  enough of ""The Phantom Menace"" to hold me over until May, 2002,  when hopefully, we'll see a darker Episode II...although, how dark can it  be if Jar Jar returns?",955152000,,1673,4.882562277580071
668116,4,6303454038,"The Phantom Menace is not the greatest movie when viewed by itself, but is a great build up for what is to come in prequels 2 and 3.
The special effects are spectacular, with amazing cities created full of life and each  with it's own distinctive feel. The architecture of the city of Theed is  grand and is breathtaking when seeing a long shot over the city. A gripe  with the special effects is that it is a little over the top. The overall  appearance of the film is too much like an animated film. The battle of the  gungans against the droid army is spectacular in it's complexity, but is  too fake, with bright colours and a virtual environment. It doesn't have  the same feel as the battle of the ewoks in Return of the Jedi, which was  similar, but more real.
Nothing comes close in any film to the power of  the light saber weilding Jedi. The final battle scenes are highlighted by  the long dual between the Jedi and Sith. The greatest moment being in the  hanger after freeing the pilots, and the soundtrack starts as the doors  open to reveal Darth Maul.
The Phanom Menace does miss some character  development of the original Trilogy, with a character like Han Solo missed  greatly. The movie lacks the dark and evil feel that was so great in all of  the old three movies.

668218,3,6303454038,"The Phantom Menace is Episode One of the Star Wars series, and it personifies the strengths and weaknesses of the series.  George Lucas directs this episode - his first directing job since the original Star Wars  in 1977.
Star Wars was partly inspired by the films of Akira Kurosawa,  and The Phantom Menace is the most openly Kurosawa-esque of the series,  primarily in the portrayals of Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and  Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor),  Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman), and the  film's primary villain, Darth Maul.  The Kurosawa influence shows as well  in some of the aliens (almost all of them created by CGI) within the film,  notably the Trade Federation viceroy who commands an invasion of Queen  Amidala's homeworld, Naboo.
Less influenced by Kurosawa are the  Skywalker family, the young Anakin Skywalker and his mother.  Anakin's  passion is podracing - here lies the influence of Lucas' 1973 film American  Graffiti - and in such an endeavor he displays a strength and reflexes that  Qui-Gon recognizes are characteristic of ""the chosen one.""  Though the film's podracing angle is more distracting than anything - it  comes off as a Dirk Benedict-esque scam from The A-Team - it does help  establish the relationship between Anakin and Queen Amidala - some have  criticized this angle for tackiness, but I thought it was very nicely  done.
There is also politicking in the republic's Imperial Senate on  Coruscant, featuring a nice cameo by Terence Stamp (General Zod from the  Superman films) as well as dialogue between Amidala and Senator Palpatine -  who regular fans of the Star Wars films know will change over the course of  the story.
These are the film's character stengths.  The film's  weaknesses are personified in the obnoxious comedy relief of CGI creation  Jar Jar Binks.  Why this alleged character was created in the first place  escapes me.  Alas, he is not alone in the bad-comedy relief department -  his fellow CGI-created aliens are little better, particularly the  slobbering swine named Boss Nass.
Despite this, the film moves very  well, from the rescue of Queen Amidala and her entourage, to the podracing  subplot, to debate in the Imperial Senate (even this scene, like virtually  every other, is smothered in SFX, a strength and weakness to the film), to  the film's dazzling liberation of Naboo.  The highlights of the liberation  are the too-brief scenes of space battle and the exhausting lightsaber  fight between Qui-Gon and Kenobi against Darth Maul.
There are even a few  influences from Battlestar Galactica and the real life US Air Force - the  battle droids seen throughout the film sound like Cylons, and their command  ship is reminiscent of a Cylon base star.  As for the USAF, Queen Amidala's  personal spacecraft is little more than a sci-fi version of the SR-71  Blackbird - giving the title an unintended irony; imagine if the Naboo  fightercraft resembled F-4 Phantom fighterbombers.  In all, The Phantom  Menace is a rip-roaring good time.",955152000,,3027,5.054878048780488

I came out of the cinema  hovering between the two. The Phantom Menace - I have to ask: why is it  called this anyway? - has some exceptionally good points and some downright  awful ones. (Jar Jar Binks is one of the latter; not only can you hardly  understand what he's saying much of the time, he IS as annoying as everyone  makes out.)The acting is superb, no question about that - Liam Neeson and  Ewan McGregor are extremely good, as is Natalie Portman. However the script  is enough to make you wince. The first Star Wars movie sounded unedited,  and so does this.
Ray Park is another bone of contention with me. He's a  superb actor, brilliant in the fight sequence, and turns his lines into  something truly sinister. So why wasn't more made of his character? Darth  Maul was fantastic but he only appears once or twice, and dies without even  a last word. He hardly even has a first word, come to that.
Overall, the  story is debatable, the visual aspects stunning, the characters held up by  good acting, the script appalling but rescued again by the actors. Buy it  if you love Star Wars enough to gloss over some of its shortcomings.",955152000,,1482,4.409594095940959
668221,4,6303454038,"This movie is one of the best. Although this is one of the best movies of all time, the original ""Star Wars"" movies are the best. As far as sticking to the facts and the future events in episodes IV, V, and VI, the screenwriters have done a pretty god job of keeping on the subject. If you  have not seen this movie, I highly recommend it. It has all the great  elements found in an extremely good movie. Adventure, tragedy, comedy,  romance, drama, great acting, etc. This is also a great stay-at-home family  movie.",955065600,,517,4.410526315789474
668222,4,6303454038,"It's important to note that I am only giving this movie four stars because I am an avid fan.  You'll see no argument from me in that it was not better than the first three.  It still makes an interesting flick.
Some of the  movie's downfalls are that : 1) ""Overkill"" on the digital  effects.  (I still have yet to see a Jabba the Hutt that is realistic and  compares to the vile form from Return of the Jedi.) 2) Can't understand  what Jar-Jar Binks and his other race members are saying. 3) The first 1/3  of the movie is saved by the Jedi scenes, otherwise it contains rather  boring characters.
Lucas did score big on his digital effects with the  fantastic pod racing scene and the ending jedi knight duel.  (Too bad my  two favorite characters were both killed.) One aspect that might take away  from the movie if you are a Star Wars fan is that some of the intrigue is  taken away when you already know what happens in the future.  (aka Senator  Palpatine becomes the Emporer, Anakin becomes Darth Vader)
It's still a  good movie that I would rate above other multi-million special effects  giants such as Armageddon, Godzilla, Independece Day etc...",955065600,2,1156,4.529126213592233
668223,4,6303454038,"The first time or five that I saw Episode I, it was awesome. The special effects and visuals were so absolutely outstanding, as was the simple thrill of it being the NEW Star Wars movie.  It was such great eye candy and such a neat addition to the whole SW mythos that I was able to ignore the somewhat lame plot, the extremely long, mostly boring and corny tatooine sequence, and the under-representation of Darth Maul.
Unfortunately, on video the visual effects really are limited a lot, and since so many of the scenes are so huge and detailed, when it's scaled down to a typical TV screen size the characters are often microscopic.  It just doesn't have the impact that it did on big screen, and it gets a lot more boring.
Because this movie is entertaining and Star Wars, I give it four stars.  It it had been a stand-alone film, it probably would've been lucky to recieve three from me.",955065600,,892,4.460122699386503

I went in to the Phantom Menace expecting exactly what Lucas had provided before, a sort of campy space opera that was just much better than the sum of its parts.  And  I got just that!  The dialogue and acting are not Academy Award quality,  and the special effects certainly ARE.  The story is rehashed, and has been  done ad infinitum (some would say ad nauseum), and Lucas certainly is not  one to bring strong characterization to the screen.  But, what many people  overlook is, that's not what Lucas is good at!  He's good at telling a  story, and making you feel like you're actually peering in at a different  world.  And he did that, masterfully.  Don't see this movie to see a great  piece of modern American Cinematography, which it certainly isn't.  See  this movie because it's a tribute to storytelling at it's most basic, and  certainly a classic in it's own right.",955065600,,934,4.585365853658536

George Lucas has proved to be a master at this.  Darth Maul is  actually more impressive than Darth Vader.  To this he deserves much  credit.  However, after creating such a vivid environment and such  wonderful characters he dedicates a good portion of this movie to  deliberatley dumbed down characters like Jar-Jar Binks and the Trade  Federation cronies. It is like watching Roger Rabbit and Elmer Fudd  plodding along in a Warner Brothers cartoon.

I was used to the old Star Wars where it was almost not stop action from the opening credits till the end  of the movie. I will say this though. The first trilogy was filled with  action because it was about the war between the empire and the rebbels, and  now we are seeing the earlier story before the war had started. The special  effects were outstanding I think George was snubed at the Oscars. But about  the title of this post... I can't beleive that we will have to wait to see  this on DVD. I think that for a Director like George Lucas who created THX  and wants his movies to look the best that they can, would have released  Star Wars on DVD sooner. But I guess it is all about money.

Hence,  making it my least favorite of the 3.
  I then purchased the LBX version  of this movie. I forgot that there was more action going on.  (I saw the  movie in theaters the first time around).  There is a lot more action  happening on the sides, the ones that were cut in the ""made for your  TV"", ""pan-and-scan"" version.  This renewed action enhanced  the movie visually, giving it more ""spice"".  I liked the movie a  lot better.  I used to just skip ESB and go directly to RoTJ.  Now I watch  all 3.

The story actually starts back in  Darkhorse Comics' series, ""Tales of the Jedi"", where the Sith are  the powerful race.  The Sith have had dealings with the Jedi in the past  and lost.  Now the Sith are out for revenge.  ""Now we will get  revenge"", says Darth Maul.  The Sith are secretly using the Trade  Federation, a body in the Republic Senate, as a catallyst to start a  ""change-of-guard"" by throwing a monkey-wrench into the fragile  Republic by illegally invading the planet of Naboo.
Enter Senator  Palpatine.  A senator who's interest in gaining power in the Republic is  quite apparent when he pushes to oust Chancellor Valorum for lack of  confidence.  I still question whether or not Darth Siduous is Palpatine in  disguise, I'm not sure here.
Enter Annikin Skywalker.  A slave boy on the  planet Tatooine, born to woman who says, ""I carried him, gave birth to  him.  There was no father.""  Sounds like a premonition to me. ;)  The  Jedis have always had a prophecy that a boy would be born to bring Balance  to the Force.  However, as Qui-Gon wins Annikin's freedom and brings him in  front of the Jedi Council, Annikin fears the unknown without his mother.  As Yoda preaches, ""Fear will lead you to the Dark Side"", the Jedi  Council hesitates to train Annikin of the Force for this very reason.  The  darkness starts to loom after this as Palpatine wins Chancellor of the  Republic and pats Annikin on the shoulder with a twinkle in his eye.

668518,2,6303454038,"The hallmark of the first three Star Wars films was that a timeless, superbly engaging story was told with brilliant, groundbreaking effects. With Phantom Menace, we are faced with a half-baked, poorly written story  told with spectacular but hardly innovative effects. The overall result is  a disappointment on its own, and an outright disaster when compared to its  predecessors. George Lucas seems so intent upon the digital, that he has  utterly forgotten the power of the spiritual, the mystical, the  magical...the HUMAN. All of these qualities were present in his first three  films and are, for the most part, lacking in his latest.  Let's start  with the effects. Yes, they are marvelous...particularly in regard to the  scenes of the ""march of the androids"" in the battle with the  Gungans, the Senate hearing, the various city-shots of Naboo etc, and the  final light-saber duel. But magnificent effects alone are not going to  inspire a sense of wonder...after all, we have become quite accustomed  (even numbed) to effects- driven films...some films having very nearly the  same quality effects as Phantom Menace, and some with even more  ""effectively used"" effects. So George was giving us nothing THAT  radically new, a thing he had previously accomplished with his other films.  In fact, some of his effects seemed dated and underwhelming. Several of the  background creatures on Tatooine looked like rejects from 'The Muppet  Show,' and the digitally- created Federation androids were just plain  silly-looking. They weren't the slightest bit intimidating. Those androids  were a huge effects goof. The Pod-race was gripping and ""very good  cinema,"" but there was no sense of urgency. They weren't destroying a  death star...they were just gambling on getting parts for their ship.  The acting was TERRIBLE, but it's not the fault of the actors...the script  stunk to high heaven. If I heard ""I feel a disturbance,"" or  ""The situation seems more complicated than we thought,"" or  ""We have no time for this,"" once, then I heard these lines a  thousand times. The dialogue was horrifically stilted, real emotion was  absent, the scenes seemed strung together with Elmer's glue, and the  characters were uninvolving. Every character was a bore in this flick, from  Qui Gon-Jin to Queen Amidala (whose cheesy, corny-looking outfits seemed  more fitting for second-rate drag queens than a space queen). Yoda was  underused, Samuel Jackson's acting was hilariously bad, and the Jar Jar  Binks character was REALLY the most shockingly useless Star Wars character  ever imagined. What was Lucas thinking? The racial bit was painfully  obvious. At the end of this film, I wouldn't have been surprised to see the  bell-bottomed, big-butted, pigeon-English Gungans stooping to worse lows.  They did everything but tap-dance and spit watermelon seeds. How very  stupid and insulting and the character was completely unconvincing.  I  know that people warn against comparing this film to the others, but the  film IS based on the others, IS related to the others, and IS meant to be  regarded in at least SOME connection with the others. But that doesn't  matter. Even on its own, it's a bore, an example of what can happen when  Lucas panders to the dumbing down of the audience by believing that no one  really cares about a great story anymore. Visually, Phantom Menace has  everything but the kitchen sink...but it has no soul.",954979200,15,3436,5.141304347826087
668519,3,6303454038,"Although this was a good movie overall, there were many things that just made me wonder if Lucas is taking drugs.
1) No DVD until all the movies are done?  Why not release E1 now on DVD and re-release all the episodes  again later with the features he intended?  People tell me Lucas isn't in  it for the money anymore cause he has a ton of money, but it seems like  he's pretty greedy to me.
2) Mostly bad acting.  Neeson and McGregor  seemed to have no emotions, but they acted MUCH better than Natalie Portman  and especially Jake Lloyd (""Wow, this is tense!"").  Bad script,  bad acting.
3) I don't think C3PO and R2D2 should have been in the movie.  Anakin as the creator of C3PO is a really lame idea.  Obi-Wan meeting  R2D2/C3PO here would have meant he already knew them in Episode 4, but we  all know he really DIDN'T know them in Episode 4.  Darth Vader didn't know  them either.
The only really good things about this movie was the special  effects, the Jedi battles, and Darth Maul (scary character even though he  wasn't shown much and didn't say anything).  Pod race was OK.  This movie  was also too much of a little kid movie compared to the other episodes,  thanks to Jar Jar and Anakin.",954892800,2,1203,4.372727272727273
668520,5,6303454038,"My friends say i'm not a true ""Star Wars"" fan because i absolutely loved ""The Phantom Menace."" I guess that is their way of telling me that they didn't like it.  I felt the film did a fine job  serving as the first episode of the saga. First off, in rebutal to what  others may have claimed, the movie didn't exactly have ""loose  threads"" in the story. In my opinion, i saw them as open doors for  what is yet to come in Episodes II & III. Second of all, i had no  complaints with any of the actors or their performaces. Ewan Mc Gregor and  Natalie Portman are just getting warmed up as, the young, Obi-Wan Kenobi  and Queen Amidala(mother of Luke and Leia). Liam Neeson's performance as  Qui-gon Ginn was as noble as his character was meant to be, from the start  of the story to his untimely death.  Many people complained about Jar Jar  Binks. I never had a problem with him or the Gungans. I didn't mind their  comic releif at all.  In fact i was more dissappointed when an army of  Ewoks defeated the imperial stormtroopers on Endor.  Others have also  complained about Jake Lloyds performance, I felt he played his role very  innocently, just as his character is. Ray Parks' performace as Darth Maul  was one to definitely pay attention to, adding some stunning light saber  work to the film. I was really happy to see R2-D2, C-3PO and Jabba the Hutt  again.  New characters such as Watto and Sebulba, were instantly classic.  The new computer generated characters, blended in perfectly with the human  actors. Some may have felt that some characters lacked the depth of other  ""Star Wars"" characters, but why should there be another Han Solo  or Chewbacca? They are in Episodes IV, V & VI. I think the charcters  will really come to shape in the next two episodes and people will  recosider the characters of Episode one. See the awesome effects. Hear and  feel the great sound effects, as well as the awesome, John Williams, score.  See it for yourself and enjoy it. I urge those who weren't immediately  pleased in the theater, to go back again and check it out on video and look  for the things that they may have missed before. As a fan,i feel that the  widescreen version is a must, the bonus documentary, art book and film  strip are great bonus. I seem to enjoy it more and more after each viewing.  The only thing i find dissapointing, is having to wait two more years for  the next episode and another five for the third. Until then, i will enjoy  ""The Phantom Menace"" over and over(as well as the other three).",954892800,28,2527,4.462719298245614

668633,3,6303454038,"Episode One isn't exactly the best movie of the year, but I had a helluva good time with some of the scenes (namely the pod racing scene). What Lucas needs to do is to not pay so much attention to effects and make his  characters more... likeable. Maybe give them some depth and development.  Some of these guys just appeared out of nowhere, as if Lucas didn't feel  like making up any original origins. Jake Lloyd was bad as usual; Osment  would have been a better choice. Lloyd tries too hard with his in-your-face  voice and redundant facial expressions. Jar Jar didn't annoy me as much as  he did with other folks, and Darth Maul. Oh man. He was great. Those  fighting sequences were beautiful. Lucas is a fool for killing him off so  fast, and he should have had more screen time. Ah, well. Maybe in Episode  Two, Lucas will try harder to give the people what they want: Original,  wholesome, light-hearted fun and not a special effects ridden excuse for a  box office hit. Like I said, it was entertaining. Very entertaining. But  it's hard to even think that it belongs in the same series as the first  three.",954892800,,1116,4.492537313432836

What ""The Phantom Menace"" adds up to is a banal script, some really dreadful dialogue, some idiotic  characters (somebody lock up Jar-Jar and throw away the key), and some  dazzling, stupendous special effects.  The second installment should be a  lot more promising when we find out when and how young Anakin Skywalker  took the initial wrong turn that ultimately transformed him into Darth  Vader; that movie may have some real juice to it.  For now, Lucas and Co.  need to realize that it takes considerably more than awesome special  effects to make a good movie.",954892800,,676,4.700854700854701

Star Wars fans have been waiting for this for years, have been, in my opinion, rewarded  with a wonderful film. It was so neat, experiencing Star Wars the way our  parents must have, seeing it for the very first time. I especially loved  learning about the Jedi Temple. There are whole new worlds to learn about.  Even Tatooine, which we know from the first trilogy gains a new depth. My  favorite was Naboo, with it's fabulous cities and wldlife. Congratulations  to whoever thought up and created the costumes and hairdos for Amidala.  They deserve a standing ovation. I hope you get a chance to see this movie.  Don't let the bad reputation of Jar Jar Binks keeep you from enjoying this  film.",954892800,,832,4.682758620689655
668636,2,6303454038,"Seems like George Lucas got everything right in this prequel except the most fundamental levels of film storytelling:  Acting and scripting.
What we have here is an incredibly stiff, paratactic script with minimal  thought, lost in all the terms, names and sight gags, but without any  degree of depth whatsoever.  I thought C-3PO was already an annoying  character, but Lucas one-upped him with the insufferable Jar Jar  Binks...and you thought the Ewoks were bad!  The jokes are juvenile and  come at the most inopportune times and most of the supporting characters  are irritating, seething masses, pale excuses for either hero or villain.  Lucas also seems to have lost touch with narrative; The Phantom Menace is  nothing more than a series of events barely set up, anticipated, or allowed  to breathe; the lack of sophistication in plot development often makes this  film feel like a sitcom.  Actually, even sitcoms tend to have better  plotting than this.  The only emotional impact this film ever achieves is  because of the editing and visceral effects -- the pod race is absolutely  thrilling, and the three-personed light-sabre duel at the climax is  extraordinary action filmmaking...however, Lucas makes some rotten choices  in storytelling even at the climax.  Do we *really* want to cut back to  another 10-year-old-humoured Jar Jar Binks gag right after Qui-Gon is  killed?  Why release the tension of Queen Amidala's near-capture just when  all the heroes seem on the verge of defeat (always a good  cliffhanger)?
Worse of all, there's an abundance of poor performances in  this film.  The Jedi Knights work well enough, with Liam Neeson adding his  signature grace to an under-developed character, and Ewan McGregor fares  surprisingly well as young Obi-Wan.  Darth Maul, quietly menacing and  extremely physical (all of his movements have a supernatural fluidity  that's a joy to watch), could've used much, much more screen time, but at  least he makes for a good opponent.  If only he'd been more present in the  rest of the film.
Counteracting these good personnel are a skin-deep  Natalie Portman performance (where's Carrie Fisher when you need her?);  hammed-up voice work for the puppet characters, droids and villains; and  the most terrible blow to the movie -- Anakin Skywalker.  This has to be  one of the most vomit-inducing, cutesy, fake, shallow child-actor  performances I've ever seen.  The gushing blond-kid thing may work in a  children's film, but against the larger-than-life world of Star Wars, he's  a 12-inch thorn.  And *this* is supposed to be young Darth Vader?  Whenver  Lucas lets the kid loose in one of his ""oops"", ""uh-oh""  antics, I feel like I'm watching Home Alone.  Not a pleasant sensation at  all, and it certainly makes both the kid's supposed sacrifice (completely  unconvincing)  What this character needed was an edge of darkness; in the  same year Haley Joel Osment dazzled with his haunted performance in The  Sixth Sense, this desecration of the Anakin character is especially  blasphemous.  And from the original creator of the Star Wars series, to  boot.
The action sequences were wonderful; if only Lucas had paid  attention to the human truths and emotional sophistication of the script.",954892800,4,3253,5.15606936416185

Most of the the movie is so ""compacted"" that you miss part of the action at times that  takes place to the left or right from the center of action.  Example: When  Naboo is invaded, Droid fighters fly past the palace (in the movie).  On  video, you hear but do not see and the focus on the queen looking out the  window is a little jerky.
Most reactions from actors on the side are  missing as the action unfolds, etc.
AVOID THIS VERSION LIKE THE  PLAQUE.

668744,4,6303454038,"I watched the The Phantom Menace with the full effect of the video trailers coursing through my veins.  I had seen it before on the big screen and despite my earlier misgivings, it IS Star Wars, after all, and I HAD to  own the video.  I was pleased with the visuals and had no real problems  with the so-called complicated story line involving taxes and trade  treaties. My only conerns stem from basic story-telling faux-pas by Mr.  Lucas.  The movie is huge, it is a grand sweeping space opera, but why,  then, do I feel nothing for the poor opressed Naboo. We are repeatedly told  that, "" People are dying"" , but the suffering alluded to is off  screen and there is nothing to anchor it to me, as a viewer. In the first  (4rth) Star Wars, Carrie Fisher does a great job conveying the horror of  watching her home planet being blown up. Seconds later Alec Guinness does  the same, while training Luke on the Millenium Falcon. This is all done  without any real violent images that would have made the movie non-PG, but  do convey the sense of evil that is the empire. In Phantom, I don't fear  the trade federation. They have an army of odd looking robots and tend to  care little for the environment, but they rarely hurt people.  Perhaps  the scariest villan in all of the Star Wars movies is the torture droid in  the Death Star. It has no lines, is on screen for a few seconds and does  nothing overtly evil. The threat of what happens or happened made the death  star worth blowing up. Frankly, I couldn't care if the Senate got bogged  down for a few months debating the Naboo blockade.  This is all trivial,  I know, but if the plot had been at all involving on a human level, the  film would have easily bested Titanic. I had no problem with Jar-Jar Binks  either, other than some of his dialogue seem to have come from the Olsen  twins on old Full House episodes, he at least had personality and character  depth. I trust, in the tradition of the original Triology, character  development will come as the stories progress, but George my friend, we  could have used a bit more. Really, the first words of Anakin's mouth after  the only father figure he has ever known burns on a funeral brier are,  "" So, what's gonna happen to me now?"" . George, we know he is  going to be Darth Vader, but that is cold.  I read the screenplay and  the novel, and for people wanting more than eye candy, give either a read.  You will discover a father and son relationship between Obi-wan and Qui-gon  that was missing on screen as well as a jealousy born out of Qui-gon's  adoption of Anakin. Jar-Jar is a bit more understated, which makes him more  paletable and Sidious/Palpatines real plans (ie the phantom menace, if you  will) seem to lurk sinisterly below everything that goes on.  George,  you had a tough task to live up to, most would have run and hid, but you  managed to create a new world for all us adults(?) to run and play in for a  couple of hours...oh yeah, and all the kids too, for whom the movie was  really intended. Forgive my Dawson's-Creek-armchair-deconstructionist take  on it all, I know it is really a kids movie. I look forward to the rest of  the series and see Phantom as a solid foundation for future stories to be  told.

He's not even human, he doesn't sound like the cliche stereotype (except for the fact that when I read the book, his speech loooked a bit Carribean in  print--but doesn't sound that way on film). In this film, he reminds me  more of Lou Costello with his wackiness and excitability (when the head of  state of his people confers general's rank on him, he passes out). I'm glad  they chose an English guy for the younger Obi Wan Kenobi--if they'd hired  some American dude, it would have spoiled the whole presence of the  character. It's a bit of a reach to see little Anakin Skywalker as such a  talented pilot at that young an age--an ability his son would inherit. But  the book doesn't begin to capture the charm of Padme (aka the actual Queen  Amidala). That girl can brighten up a room just by walking the door and has  a serenity which transcends the fact that she's just a kid. All in all,  this is quite a decent flick. It's far too easy to measure it against the  original trilogy, but that's exactly what I suggest. Ignore all the hype  and marketing, ignore all the naysayers who call it a ripoff of the orignal  trilogy. It's one movie on a single cassette or disc.

But even the most ardent  Lucas freak has to admit that this installment of our favorite saga is  weak, frought with annoying, shallow characters, a thin as Ally McBeal  plot, and special effects that only seem to serve to distract from how  awful this film really is.  The original trilogy used special effects to  complement and add a dramatic touch to the action (crude as they look  today).  However, in ""Menace"" the technology overwhelms the film  (not to mention the characters and the plot) to the point where the viewer  feels as if Lucas intended the special effects to sustain the movie.  After  a while it seems to be, in the words of a local publication, ""One long  Toys R Us commercial"".  C'mon now, you REALLY, HONESTLY, think this is  a great movie?  I think many people who have written reviews are simply  blinded by their idolatry of Mr. Lucas, or they just can't admit that all  that waiting in line and counting down the days until the movie's premiere  was just a WASTE OF ENERGY AND TIME- JUST LIKE THIS MOVIE.  Sentimentality,  I'm sure, also has alot to do with the high ratings- if you grew up like me  mesmerized by the originals (not to mention the merchandise), then you hate  to admit that your fond memories of a wonderful cinematic experience are  bastardized and reduced to this mindless repackaging job that has no  refernce to what you originally saw years ago.  Please Star Wars fans-  admit that you can't go home again and replay the original trilogy-- maybe  it will make Mr. Lucas reconsider continuing this farce.",954892800,3,1745,4.592833876221499
668891,5,6303454038,"This review is not so much a review of the movie, but more a review of the people who have pulled this movie apart.
Let's start off with my favorite pet peeve, that young Anakin Skywalker does not permeate with the evil of  the future Darth Vader. Do you think that at 6 or 8 years old that young  Adolf Hitler gave any kind of signs as to what he would become? Anakin is  just a boy, he is not evil just waiting to get bigger or older. True he  turns evil, but as Obi-wan said in the original Star Wars that Vader was  once a Jedi Knight who turned to the dark side.
Pet peeve #2; Too many  loose ends in the movie. What ends were loose? Don't they continue in the  next two prequels? Didn't they have ""loose ends"" in Star Wars?  and Empire?
Pet Peeve #3; I couldn't follow the plot. Give me a break!  Senator Palpatine used the Trade Federation's blockade of Naboo in order to  get Queen Amidala to suggest a ""Vote of No Confidence"" in Supreme  Chancelor Velorum. Why? To gain that position himself in order to further  his goals of total control over the universe. Naboo, Queen Amidala, Darth  Maul, and the Trade Federation were all pawns in Senator Palpatine's  overall plan.
Pet Peeve #4; I hated Jar-Jar Binks. I liked him! He added  a comical part to the movie and showed that everyone despite thier  appearance or race can contribute greatly to society or in this case the  galaxy. I will conceed that I would have like to have seen more of Darth  Maul and less of Jar-Jar.
Finally I think the coolest part of the whole  movie is when Qui-Gon Jin punches through the blast doors with his  lightsaber and starts cutting through it. WOW! Second coolest was the  lightsaber duel at the end.
Keep up the great work Mr. Lucas, however  consider this. Make the three sequels to Star Wars now while all of the  original cast is still alive. Those three films would be #1, #2 and #3 for  a long, long time.",954892800,2,1907,4.322033898305085

But by not releasing this film on DVD my feeling that George Lucas does not really care or understand what he has created has been confirmed.  His devoted  fans of 23 years have been for many weeks begged him to release his films  on DVD and he has seriously let us down. Consumers have been begging him to  take their money but George apparently wants to hold out for more. He touts  his films as being state of the art but he wants us to buy the inferior  picture quality of VHS so we'll all end up buying both versions. He knows  that because he sold a lot Special Editions to people who already owned the  original. Does anyone seriously buy the press release from Lucasfilm?  There are a lot of firms doing excellent transfers to DVD all George had to  do was pick up the phone.  (How busy could he be?  I hope he's taking  bathroom breaks.)  Even a bad or mediocre DVD is better than VHS anyday.

The awesome music of John Williams can't hide a bad movie behind the music, because that's what Phantom is, the worse Star Wars movie ever. Not to say it's the worst movie ever made, but next to the other Star Wars movies, it's not even close. Problems? Well, the acting is so bad, (it's almost funny to see some of the actors try to be serious,) the storyline is confusing, the special effects are way overdone, I think I appreicated George's work when he had no computers to use--- and that  annoying Jar Jar Binks made me want to hate this movie even more. I think he was in for 30% of the movie and that alone made me want to walk out of the theater....I virtually  felt like I was watching a muppet movie mixed in with Star Wars characters. No Harrison Ford, no Marc Hamil, no Alec Guiness. You will miss them all while watching this so-called Star Wars movie.  If it hadn't have been for the light saber scene with Darth Maul VS Kenobi, and the decent acting of Liam Neeson and Yoda, Phantom Menace would have been a total disaster. The Clone Wars didn't help out much either, but at least that one is worth a little more of your time and money.  If Star Wars, Empire and Jedi never existed, Phantom may have been a better farce, but the fact is, this movie is no near the quality of what Lucas is normally capable of.

You have to view this movie with an open mind however. Anyone who is a Star  Wars fan and speaks negatively about it can't accept the fact that there is  no Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, etc. You have to remember that this is the  beggining, and you have to accept it the way it is. Most important of all,  you can't compare it to the first three movies. It's completely different  with a lot of different angles and chracters that certainly have their own  merrit. Not to mention the technology used to make this movie is a 100  times better and more advanced that it was in the mid-70's and early 80's,  so it looks different than the origional 3 which I will admit took me a  time or two to adjust to.

668895,2,6303454038,"I am a fan of the original Star Wars and its first sequel, The Empire Strikes Back.  Phantom Menace continues the trend  began in Return of the Jedi, with the series stressing its appeal to children rather than  developing a coherent storyline and developed characters.  But hey, kids  are the ones who buy the action figures (mostly!) and thus that is who the  movie is geared towards.  The special effects are excellent, but cannot  carry a movie by themselves.  The poorly conceived story of Phantom Menace  is appalling, especially when you consider that George Lucas has 15 years  to come up with one.  For example, the film could have started with Kenobi  getting his last lesson from Yoda before embarking on his first mission  with Qui-Gon, considering that Obi Wan is the central character of the  film.  Anakin Skywalker should have been older, say as a cocky headstrong  teenager rather than a cute little boy.  The taxation of trade routes  problem is not properly explained (who is taxing whom, and how does bombing  Naboo into smithereens solve the problem?) nor are the Sith Lords explained  either, though the next film will probably address this.  Darth Maul is an  intense and interesting villain, but he is not given very much to say or  do, and thus he never generates the hatred and loathing that Darth Vader  elicits from the viewers.  While R2D2 and C3PO are thrown in to give some  continuity with the original series, having C3PO created by Anakin/Darth  Vader is not credible at all.  This movie could have had great potential if  the story was probably developed, but in the end one can't help but feel  that this was cranked out just to make a lot of bucks.  Unless you are an  absolute die hard fan of the series, there is no reason to purchase this  film.",954806400,16,1785,4.688311688311688

The picture did not seem to be up to usual VHS standards, and was so far beneath DVD standards as to be laughable.  The only redeeming virtue of  this tape was the sound quality, which was surprisingly good considering it  was not digital. The best sound effects in the universe could not make up  for the grainy, blurred picture.

To try and go back to the begining and give a begining to an established film was a tall order. Not wanting to raise or  lower my expectations, I didn't watch any of the previews for the movie. I  think the film was an outstanding work and helped set the stage for the  next few films. Jar-Jar was bad, but not releasing the film in DVD was  worse. I would love to own the film, but will have to pass. I will not buy  this VHS format and turn around and buy the same movie in a year or two  like the original ""Special Edition's"".

668898,4,6303454038,"I would rank ""Phantom Menace"" ahead of ""Return of the Jedi"", but behind ""Star Wars"" and ""Empire Strikes Back"".
Postives about the movie:
1) The special effects are  dazzling, and it takes repeated viewings to see everything.
2) Great  sound effects and musical score.
3) The battle near the end of the movie  between Darth Maul and the Jedi Knights was exciting.
4) The pod race was  terrific to watch, especially if your TV has a stereo system and a large  screen.
  Negatives about the movie:
1)  ""Phantom Menace""  lacks a charismatic star, like Harrison Ford or even Carrie Fisher.
2)  Script is weak at times, and the plot is confusing.
3)  Jar Jar Binks  gets too much camera time.
4)  Jake Lloyd, the boy who played Anakin  Skywalker, was too young for me to believe he could accomplish everything  he did in the film.
5) The movie was about 20 minutes too long.
  If it wasn't for the wonderful special effects, I would probably have given  ""Phantom Menance"" a lesser rating.  Still, it's a fun movie to  watch, and hopefully the next one will be even better.",954806400,,1066,4.569148936170213
668959,4,6303454038,"Before I even get into the film itself, I must say that the standard edition is NOT the proper way to view this film. Unlike the original trilogy, Lucas utlizes the entire theaterical screen, and on the standard  version bits have been cut off as to make the action seem cramped and  uncomfortable. The lightsaber duel against the destroyer droids at the  film's beginning is a good example of this. Sometimes a character will turn  their head, only to stare off at nothing because the other character has  been cut off. By all means, shell out the extra $$ for widescreen, its  worth it. Other than that, Episode One is an excellent, action-packed  sci-fi film, with incredible special effects (no-duh), a John Williams  patented score (featuring duel of the fates) and cameos by several familiar  characters. My only complaint is that the boring parts of the movie do  start to get to you on the standard edition, because the extra interesting  surrounding eye-candy has been cut off. I still fill a tingle run through  my body each time I watch the federation ship blow up at the film's  conclusion, it's THAT good!",954806400,,1118,4.760416666666667

My eyes never left the screen the  entire time, and my hands were still shaking with excitement from it. My  brain was numb, and I came out of their completely satisfied.  Then, a week  later, the numbness wore off, and I began to compare it to the previous  Star Wars movies.  This movie is a great movie, one with amazing special  effects and interesting (yet predictable) plot twists.  Still, the  originals still stand in a class of their own, that this one does not  reach.  This is definately a movie I encourage you to see, however don't  watch with expectations of the original trilogy. This movie loses alot of  it's glamor on the small screen, but is still one that should be bought,  watched, and put on a shelf, but do not stack it with your older collection  of the original trilogy, because this doesn't even come close.",954806400,,1018,4.451086956521739

I not ashamed to say that I enjoyed  this movie at the theatre as much as I loved taking part in the  anticipation.  The whole thing was an experience I was glad to be a part  of.

Now don't get me  wrong about the movie. I loved it (except for those kids in front of me  during the movie). The plot was excellent because we all know what all of  it is leading up to. I somewhat agree with the people who say you really  didn't feel for the characters like in the last three. I think the visual  effects did play a big role in this movie. For one that could pull off  things they couldn't in the last three. I remember talking to my brother  about how they should go and do the last three over exactly the same but  with better effects. Well I'm going to make this short. It all comes down  to that this Star Wars isn't the best of the bunch but it has a lot of eye  candy and action. Also you got to remember there are two more coming out.  Maybe they will pull those off a little better. So right now I'm off to buy  my copy of Star Wars I.,954806400,,1136,4.040358744394619

There is nothing wrong with Jar Jar. Jar Jar,  in the words of Bill Clinton, ""I feel your pain.""

Viewers must understand however, that with everything that happened and all the plot twists that occured in Episodes 4-6, it was probably very difficult for George Lucas to  pack in all the plot development that was necessary for this prequel and  still have some juice left over for character development (Many fans of the  Holy Trilogy had high expectations of this film, too high. They expected  everything that the previous films were and then some. The latter three  episodes were jam-packed full of character development and the plot just  followed the characters -- Lucas was able to do this easily because back  then there were no expectations. Which is why they were such a hit, because  people really LOVED the good guys (Rebel Alliance) and HATED the bad guys  (Empire)). The result was that the only characters that had any sort of  development were Queen Amidala and Anakin Skywalker, and this only to  foreshadow their romance that is sure to come in Episode II. Yeah he's only  10, but I mean come on, it's Natalie Portman (great casting Mr. Lucas!).  Besides, how do you think he fathers Luke? So to wrap things up, this is a  fanastic movie.

I watched the original trilogy mere days before viewing Episode I and the problem is clear.  The old movies were  based on humanity and close friendships, and the new one is all technical  talk and machinery.  Lucas has seriously misjudged the characters of Anakin  and Jar Jar - skipping around exclaiming ""yippee!"" does not  suggest a dark soul, and falling over a lot isn't funny.  It's a pity Lucas  didn't recognise the good stuff and throw out the bad when writing his  screenplay because he has to realise the Star Wars movies ARE sensational,  and to make a new one it MUST exceed them, or at least match them.

This  movie is a lot more technologicaly adavanced then the first 3 films but  when the movies are released on DVD the will be in widescreen version and  will be considerably cleaned up.

Plus,  there's the heartstopping Podrace-which should have snagged Menace a  special effects Oscar at this year's Academy Awards. And like the Star Wars  films before it, this one's got heart, too; the benevolent Qui-Gon Jinn  (Liam Neeson) easily ranks among my favorite Star Wars heroes ever, as does  Ewan McGregor's young Obi-Wan Kenobi (the Scot's Alec Guiness accent is  near perfect!). Ignore the naysayers and get your hands on a copy now.

669056,5,6303454038,"The bottom line: if you are a truly devoted Star Wars fan (such as myself), you will love the movie; if you are a fairweather or new fan you will appreciate it.  The brilliance of George Lucas resides in the  thickness and depth of the subject matter.  No one can watch this movie  only once and say they have an honest opinion.  I saw it twelve times in  the theatre and still want more!
SW:E1 boasts splendid special effects, a  ground-thumping score we've come to expect from John Williams, a delightful  array of new characters and dazling new worlds.  However, I feel that one  of Lucas' greatest triumph is his ability to deliniate the clear difference  between good and evil and do so in a clean manner.  Indeed, the violence is  not uneedlingly graphic, there are NO curse words and no sex or nudity, yet  EPISODE 1 will entertain and please both the family and the shoot-em-up,  bang-em-up action crowd. This is truly commendalbe.
Additionally, Lucas'  uncanny ability to take complex subjects (and even boring some would  say)like politics, religion, economics, international trade and  anthropology and convert them into  fantastic storylines is unparalleled.  This means that people from all walks of life can enjoy the movie.
By  most popular standards this would seem like a painfully dull and boring  movie (ie.no sex, no graphic violence and unappealing topics). On the  contrary, the Pod Racing scenes, the climactic lightsaber duel and the  three-way battle sequence should be more than enough to grip audience  attenion. My personal favorite was the lightsaber duel; you have never seen  anything like it (until Episode II of course)!
In closing, the entire  Star Wars saga is the quintisential embodiment of what a clean, great movie  (with an incredible storyiline) should be.",954720000,6,1797,5.0

I know I would love this film if I was a very young kid (4-8 years old, maybe). There are plenty of  things to keep children of that age group enthralled.  This film also had a  task of keeping the millions of Star Wars fans who have since grown  up(physically, anyway)interested. This could have been the case but, and I  know that so many fans will never admit this-it didn't succeed. Compare it  to the other episodes all you want.  Sure, all of them have bad acting and  questionable plots but the characters in episodes IV, V, and VI had some  chemistry and you actually cared about them, even after just the first  movie. This movie doesn't have that.  I would have forgiven the  mind-numbingly idiotic Jar Jar Binks (Kids hate him too, don't be fooled),  if there were characters that made you care for them and root for them. At  this point I wouldn't have cared if Darth Maul had miracled himself back to  life at the end and cut everyone in half(the queen, Obi-wan, C3PO, Anakin,  and especially Jar Jar-Off with their heads! ), making for  Highlander-esque continuity. There is a reason that this film competed for  the dubious Rasberry Award for the worst film of the year. That is how the  grown-up world rates this film, but let the kids enjoy their film for now.  A great many will grow up and hate it, much like many Star Wars fans did  when they watched Return of the Jedi later in life and realized how stupid  the Ewoks were.",954720000,16,1564,4.426056338028169

George, we all know that you're planning  a big release after the other two films are released, but believe me, there  are plenty of us out here that would gladly purchase a meat and potatoes  version of this fine movie on DVD and go for the high-octane version in 4  years, but instead have to purchase it on VHS at present.
As for the pan  & scan version of this film, because this was created for the BIG  screen, it was lacking in the grandure that surrounded it in theaters.  While it helps to have a good sound system, it is still VHS sound quality.  The story, characters, and plot are classics just by carrying the Star Wars  name.

669128,4,6303454038,"Okay, I saw this movie three times at the theater. The first time, as with most people I know, I was a bit disappointed and hated Jar Jar. The second time, after trying to see 'the big picture', I took it for what it was, the  beginning of an epic tale. I even semi-tolerated Jar Jar. The third time I  picked it apart piece by piece trying to understand exactly what we were  being set up for. I even kinda liked Jar Jar this time, even bought a Jar  Jar poster for my daughters wall :) What I've come to conclude is that even  though I liked the movie, it's a tale that could've been told in about 45  minutes. There's so much more that could've been included to thicken the  plot and give the movie a little beef. Indeed, it was a bit thin. However,  I'm judging this on the other Star Wars movies. I tried putting myself in  the situation of ""what if"". Meaning, what if there was no other  Star Wars movies. What if this was a complete first time original. Would it  still go over? Would it still warrant a sequel? If there wasn't a huge fan  base already would it have been a flop? I honestly don't think so. It  would've been a completly original movie, and although a bit slow, have  huge potential for a sequel. I think I would have liked it still, maybe  more then I do now. I'm sure I'll watch this move 20 or more times in my  life, maybe more if they ever release a DVD. Other movies in the same  genre, however, released kinda around the same time as Episode 1, like Lost  in Space and Wing Commander, I can honestly say I care not to see again,  and I'm pretty easy to please.

Ewan McGregor was wasted as Obi-Wan Kenobi, and I  expected much more from someone that sounded and looked as menacing as  Darth Maul.  The annoying Jar Jar Binks get twice as much screen time as  either one of these characters and they're much more essential to the  telling of the story.

Jar Jar Binks is just plain irritating.  And Darth Maul, a villian who  looked so threatening and ominous in the trailer, is reduced to a bounty  hunter with five...count them FIVE...lines.  By the way...what was they  plot anyway?  Lucas said he waited 17 years to make this film because the  technology did not exist to make the special effects he desired for the  film.  Yet it wasn't the effects I remember from the original.  It was the  mythology and the characters.  Let's hope George gets tired of playing with  his new techno-toys and settles down to write a good script for the next  film.  Otherwise, I might not care about Star Wars III.",954460800,,1235,4.461538461538462
669260,4,6303454038,"After three terrific Star Wars movies comes the new Episode I. It is certainly not as good as the originals but worth some viewings. Liam Neeson is excellent as Qui Gon Jinn but his sidekick Ewan Gregor is not all that  great. The lightsaber fight was spectacular between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan  Kenobi, and Qui Gon Jinn. Darth Maul himself was really cool. The double  bladed lightsaber was a very nice touch. The battle droids were cool but  can't compare to stormtroopers, just as the Trade Federation can't compare  to the Galactic Empire and Nute Gunray can't compare to Darth Vader. I also  liked Vader better than Maul. The space fight was a bit of a joke. All you  saw was little Anakin talking to Artoo. The rest was good. But if you want  to see a REAL space battle, check out Return of the Jedi. There also  weren't to many fight scenes except the one between the Gungans and the  battle droids. For example, there is a great battle on Endor during Return  of the Jedi and an awesome battle on the ice planet Hoth between Rebels and  Imperial AT-AT walkers in The Empire Strikes Back. The cast in the  originals were way better. Some of the actors and actesses who were great  were Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, and Billy Dee Williams.  Though Episode I is good, the others are better. My favorite is The Empire  Strikes Back.",954460800,,1347,4.55

Darth Maul is the coolest, and Ray Park is also very talented.

669263,3,6303454038,"You can't tell a story with CGI alone.  Basically, what I'm saying is that SW:EpI had too much CGI effects and characters.  To tell an effective story, or film for that matter, needs good character development.  Even the  CGI characters got poor character development in this flick.
One could  not tell whether Darth Siduous was Sen. Palpatine in disguise or not.  You  couldn't get close to Qui-Gon for there was no history to him, just like  there was with Obi-wan in SW:EpIV, until he came back as ""force  apparitions"" in subsequent films that is.  Maybe that has yet to be  seen in Ep. II or III.  Even Darth Maul, the ""new"" villian had  minimal screentime.
The only character that we could get close to was  Obi-wan, Yoda and Anikin, however there still wasn't strong enough  character development in this film along to give it that  ""stand-alone"" quality that the original trilogy gave.  Even you  knew what Lando Calrissian was all about at the end of  ""Empire"".
I've only seen Ep. I once, so maybe my perception of  the film isn't as good for someone that's seen it multiple times.  Maybe my  perception will change once my Widescreen Box-set arrives on my front door  sometime next week.",954460800,5,1196,4.699029126213592

As a kid's film, it's fantastic in every sense of the word.  It should not be compared to adult themed sci-fi films.  Nor should it be compared to the other SW episodes in that they are just  that; episodes in a larger story.  I mean, who compares chapters in  books?
Naysayers dissect and analyze what they didn't like as  passionately as SW fans do about what they loved.  There's not much point  in nitpicking here so I won't bother.  I would recommend that all reviews  (including this one) be read AFTER one has seen the movie for the first  time.
The kid in all of us will either secretly or overtly enjoy this  movie.  The video format will allow easy replay.  I am still debating over  whether to spend the extra $20 on the wide-screen version.  I don't yet  have the Phillips $15,000 plasma flat screen to take full advantage of the  ""letterbox"" version, but I really dislike ""pan and  scan"" versions, so I think I'll pop for what I think will be the  better edition (widescreen.)

Jar jar was annoying at first but he  is essential to the movie, so don't go blaming his charachter.  Lucas wrote  a great story, though the deus ex machina technique is a bit irritating.  The light saber fights alone make this movie worth watching, and they put  them above the other movies in that respect.  This movie had more of a plot  than the other three.  In the others, the solution was obvious, the  execution was the problem.  In TPM though, the use of diversions is  brilliant.  The spacefighting scenes were okay.

669384,5,6303454038,"First off some simple facts.  Number one: Star Wars is a science fantasy, not a science fiction. The difference? Science Fiction is the projection of possible future worlds and technologies. (Some one give me a buzz when a  super world power creates a death star as a deterrent to war as the atom  bomb was in the beginning, or when some one has full mastery of the force.)  Number two: Star Wars: Episode One - The Phantom Menace is not a fully  stand alone movie, rather it is a chapter in much bigger story. A story  which, until now, was told with no real history or origins. The Phantom  Menace is the first of three chapters that will explore the rise of Anakin  Skywalker (played by Jake Lloyd) to greatness as a jedi to his eventual  downfall and metamorphosis to legendary villian, Darth Vader. This movie is  only the first of three, but it has already begun to establish certain key  elements of the original trilogy. Such as Senator Palpatine's (Emperor  Palpatine) manipulation of galactic politics concerning the invasion of  Theed, and the emotional issues surrounding the young Anakin as he seeks to  become a jedi. Idealy, the story is simple in execution and follows the  same saturday matinee formula that made the original movies a success(i.e.  a winning formula), boasting outstanding visual effects, that when put in  it's proper place along side the original three, it becomes all the more  understandable and all the more enjoyable. A great addition.  Now all we  need is Episodes two and three.",954201600,29,1520,4.795366795366795

This animated suicide reason was spouting off the worst of what ultra modern(MODERN) society thinks is cool! Now off of  Jar-Jar onto young Anakin. Well George ya did it...you found a worse child  actor than the Home Alone kid. Where was the Sixth Sense kid?
Now the  only reason Lucas made this film must be because Star Wars posters and  figures stopped selling, because he sure as heck didn't make it for the  fans. Instead he went the big money way of making a children's movie. True  the kids love it but in 10 yrs they'll hate themselves for it like  teenagers with Sesame Street.
And the latest sin of Lucases is not  releasing this or any other Star Wars film on DVD. The vhs release has a  minimal amount of features and is horribly over-priced! ...

Sure the tone was a bit childish at times, and the witty banter we came to expect from the  original trilogy was sorely missing, but it was still a good fantasy film.  It was still able to transport me back to the fantasy lands of my youth.  I'm not sure what else a summer fantasy/adventure film is supposed to do.  If it's supposed to make me altertnately dread and lust for a bleak future  in a strange twist of psychic self-mutilation (ala The Matrix), then i'll  take Jar Jar over Neo any day.  Besides, the Matrix looked like a 2 hour  long Gap commerical whereas Star Wars featured beautiful scenery, lush  backgrounds and a beautiful princess.  I guess I'm just an old  romantic.
As far as the flaws are concerned, what struck me as the films  biggest flaw was that it was basically a teaser or a warm up for what's to  come, which (cross fingers, knock on wood, levitate an x-wing) should be  absoultely incredible and heart-breaking.  The Phantom Menace seemed more  of a showcase of ""this is what we can do now"" than a well flushed  out story.

First I'll start with the problems.  For one the  characters are a mixed bunch.  Some like Obiwan are played by good actors  and could be interesting but aren't explored enouph.  Also other characters  like Anakin and Jar Jar are simply dumb and realy hurt the film in some  points.  The dialoge also needs work and the story, while a good start,  leaves alot of loose ends.
Now on to the good points.  Once again Lucas  proves that he can make the best special effects in the business.  This  film must be seen to be beleived.  Not only is the technology far beyond  anything else but each set is filled with imagination.
John Williams  out does himself and the music is simply excellent.  Also EP1 proves to be  even more exciting than past Star Wars films.  The action is top notch and  the final battle between three Jedi is simply amazing.
Star Wars:The  Phantom Menace has it's problems but it manages to rise above them and  still be worthy of the Star Wars name.  Barely.

I (like most others) could have  used more Darth Maul and Darth Sidious, but from what WAS in the movie, I  have no complaints.

Now all of us Star Wars fans are older, and more conscious of ourselves.  We don't let ourselves be carried away like we were when we were kids. And that is why people of this generation are bashing the Phantom Menace.  Because they can't just sit and enjoy it and be mesmerized by it, and watch with wide eyes like they did when they were kids.  They can't let themselves go to a galaxy far, far away again.

Also, Jar Jar was not utterly repulsive, we all know  why he was there, but what I'm getting at is that this is yet another  example of the roller coaster ride syndrome.  Lucas needed someone to  smooth the action over so it did not overwhelm the story and perhaps he was  right, but sending in blubbering Jar Jar (how did he get along in life  everyone wonders)?  Well, to each their own.
Also, it is quite obvious  that this movie is mostly for the kids - they identify with Anakin and as  in all kid movies, they always know more and can do more than the adults.  How else to appeal to kids than that?  I couldn't buy the fact that Anakin  could pilot, let alone BUILD a podracer.  If you were 10 or 8, or however  old he was, would YOU be out there racing for life or death?  Or how about  C-320?  Anakin is well versed in advanced physics and electronics  development and just happened to tinker him together?  Please.  And last of  all, the space combat scene where Anakin decides to join the WWII fighter  like planes and attack the droid space station.  If that really took place,  Anakin would have been blown from the sky from the flak generated from the  station.  And for those of you who read this and think I'm wrong: If you'll  remember the space battle, the other pilots were getting shot out of the  sky and were having great difficulty just holding themselves together.  And  Anakin just happens to avoid getting blown up and just happens to land in  the bay with the power generator?  Get this, he does all of this without  knowing how to pilot the thing and happins to shoot off the proton  torpedoes when he tries to get out of the bay, blowing up the station in  the process.  I know some of you will think that because he knew how to  pilot a podracer and the fact that he is ""guided by the force"",  he would be able to do all of those things.  Still, the force can only do  so much with an underdeveloped brain such as Anakin's.
About Darth Maul -  in my opinion, he was frightening to a certain extent, but he didn't say  much and so there wasn't much to fear. Had the movie stuck to character  development rather than action, it could have been hailed as the greatest  sci-fi/fantacy film since the original series, which also suffered from  some of those same kid elements.  But that's another story.  For those of  you who saw ""The Matrix"", and who didn't?, you'll remember how  the characters were well developed and it was a perfect blend of great  story and action.
You know who you are and you know what I'm talking  about.
The Phantom Menance could have been a good deal more, explaining  and remaining ON the story of the various worlds and the Jedi than filling  it with so much action that it became just that - an action picture.  And  there you have the point of my posting.  The Phantom Menance is merely an  action movie for all ages, not the great sci-fi/fantacy story it could have  been.  When are filmmakers going to wake up and realize that sci-fi fans  don't want hype and overused special effects (they should be used as a  backdrop, not making up the whole movie)...we want story and ideas; those  profound ideas that come from sci-fi!

669585,2,6303454038,"George Lucas should recognize his limitations as a director and a writer, and hand over the next two Star Wars movies over to other people. The Empire Strikes Back was neither written nor directed by Lucas, and that is  why I think it is the best of all the movies thus far. Lucas needs to limit  himself to the role of a consultant. I think the way he is worshipped by  the fans has caused him to lose his ability to be critical of his won work.  I also think he has been hurt by his years away from the camera. He should  have followed Spielberg's lead and took time out from building his empire  to hone his filmaking craft with a few non-sf movies before attempting TPM.  The movie just doesn't have the heart that I thought it needed. Also, the  chemistry between the characters was almost non-existent. Also, I wish  Lucas had not turned down the kid from the Sixth Sense who auditioned for  the Anakin part. He would have been so much better, and he would have been  old enough for there to have been a enough of a spark between him and the  queen to foreshadow their eventual romance. Also, he could have given  enough of an edge to Anakin to lay the groundwork for the darkness coming  in the later chapters. (on the other hand, if he had made TMP he might not  have gotten the chance to make the Sixth Sense - which would have been a  far greater tragedy).

They loved it and so did I.Lucas is a genius. I have already ordered my copy.

We see Obi Won and his mentor, and we found out who Anikin was  while he was young.

I  was surprised at Naboo's diversity. I was also dissapointed that Qui-Gon  Jin, ( the long awaited mentor of Obi-Wan) could not make it to E2.

This movie is intitled ""Episode 1: the Phantom Menace"".  The  title of this movie alone should be enough to tel lyou that it is an  INTRODUCTION above all else.  All this movie was intended to do, was give  you the very beginnings of answering all those questions we all had while  watching the original series.  ""Who really was Anakin Skywalker?""  ""What's the deal with Obi-Wan and Vader's conenction?""  ""just who IS this Emperor Palpatine guy?""  These are things that  were just dropped on us, but now we are being giving the answers to those  questions here.  So be PATIENT.  The only reason this movie didn't rate a  perfect 5, is simply because while there was indeed character development  regarding Obi-wan, Amidala, Palpatine, and Anakin, I'm still left asking  myself ""Who WAS Maul? And WHAT was his purpose?""  More or less, a  desperate attempt to clone Vader....it's not happening.  Be patient all you  grown-up children of the late seventies and early eighties, this was just  the introduction of the characters, weit until the finally get to the Clone  Wars, and the inevitable turn that young Anakin takes to the Dark Side.

Actually, the plot  itself wasn't bad, since it does tie in to the rest of the  ""story"".  But the lack of any substantial character development  was a major weakness.  All will be forgiven if Episode II is better, which  means it must have some of the characters actually feeling something.

669977,2,6303454038,"Let's start this by saying I am a very big Star Wars fan.  With that out of the way lets begin... There are 3 reason why I gave this movie 2 Stars.  1)  The plot of the Star Wars Trilogy has always been one of plot twists,  and this movie has enough, what this movie doesn't do is explain who is  who.  Who is the trade federation, who are the Jedi, who are the Hutts.  Mr. Lucas has assumed (properly I admit) that those who see Star Wars 1-  have seen the other 3 movies.  But if I show the Star Wars movies to my  grand children they will see SW1-first, and not have any clue about what's  ging on until SW4 2) The charaters are the most shallow ones I ever seen.  Qui-Gon, and Obi-Wan have no chemistry together.  I never once in the 3  times that I saw the movie believed that Qui-Gon, and Obi-Wan were teacher,  and student for any length of time more than the 6 months it took to film  their scenes.  Then there's Darth Maul, who has two lines, and has no  ability to put fear into anyone.  Mr. Lucas has short changed these  characters no development with them, we see them and then there gone.  Not  even 10 minuets into SW4: A new Hope we were afarid of Darth Vader, and his  storm troppers, no Maul is not one to fear, just to laugh at for having to  many tattos.  Then thers the jedi- for being a group a good natured i'm in  harmony with the force people they are really a group of Jerks, no wonder  Anni (Anikin's girlish nickname) turns to the Dark Side, and kill the Jedi,  I would to those good for nothing Jerks. 3) The plot incosistances.  Yoda  was Obi-Wan's trainer, and princes Leia's father was Bail Organa, not Bail  Antilies.  I know this is Georges story but maybe he should have checked  his source material. All in all I have waited sence 1983 to see a new Star  Wars movie, and I was largly disappointed.  Shame on you Mr. Lucas the  force was not with you always, so do us all a favor let someone good like  Speilberg, or Terinteno dircect the next movie, and make it a good one.",953510400,2,2009,4.151436031331593
670038,5,6303454038,"I have loved Star Wars from the very first time I saw A New Hope on tape. Coming from a true fan who loves these movies for what they are, a great way to be entertained, I must say that the Phantom Menace is a great  addition to the saga. I say saga not original trilogy because this movie is  the beggining of a saga, which includes the original three.
The Phantom  Menace is probably not the best Star Wars movie, that would belong to  Empire Strikes Back. But it is up there with the other two. The effects in  this move are unlike anything you've ever seen. Although the movie has a  more clean, advanced look than the first three, the effects still fit in  well with the Special Edition Trilogy. The story, I think, wasn't the most  original ever. But it was a great adventure, good guy vs. bad guy, save the  day kind of movie, which is what all the Star Wars movies are about. I  thought the actors did a great job, especially Jake Lloyd, who had to play  a tough role. Jar Jar was the comic relief, not to be taken seriously (as  many people have). The Jedi were awesome, and Yoda was still sprouting  wisdom that fans will love.
I have read many reviews on this movie and  one thing that comes up a lot is that no one could make an emotional link  with the Phantom Menace like they could with the original three. This to me  was easy. From the opening scroll I had chills up my spine every time I  realized this was a Star Wars movie. The podrace, space battles, Jedi  Duels, they were all great.
My favorite part in the whole movie is when  a group of maybe twenty people, including two Jedi and armed guards, stop  dead in their tracks as doors open and a menacing dark figure blocks their  way with nothing but a stare. That's movie magic people.

I've seen three major threads of critcism against Star Wars, Episode One:
1. It's not as  good as the other movies
2. The acting and dialog are wooden and  slow
3. The special effects aren't as good as other  movies on the  market
In order:
1. SW TPM is a great story.  If you know anything  about the story you are watching unfold, it stands on its own, no  problem.
If you doubt this, go back and watch the prior three movies,  then watch TPM again.  Count how many things you missed the first time.  Did you notice the personal Palpatine Guard is nearly the same as the  dreaded Imperial Guard of Lord Sidious in the last of the series, except  for color of the  uniforms?  Did you see the visual and storyline clues  about where Princess Leia comes from (Amidala's daughter, sent to Alderaan  to be hidden from Darth Vader; we know she was adopted from the first 3  movies).
Sure, there are some major holes in the story, but when viewed  as part of the saga, it is far more insightful into what and why things  happen in the original trilogy.
2. The dialog is slow - and predictable  at times; but remember, most of the plot is emulating Royalty, and  precision of words over dramatic flair.  The Jedi at times seem dull,  because they come across as overly serious - how ""perky"" would  your attitude be if you were a lifetime devotee of one cause, to the  exclusion of all else? No, it's not The Lion King or some other Disney  Cartoon - it's Star Wars!
If you think TPM has slow dialog, again, go  watch the original - some of the acting is so awful in SW IV A New Hope,  it's laughable.  Maybe Lucas just didn't have the number of takes needed to  get it right, or the actors really stunk and got better - look at the  outtakes from the ""Luke Skywalker"" screen tests.
3.  Fewer  things explode spectacularly, true.  You have to almost be a computer  graphics geek to appreciate how much easier ""A Bug's Life"" is, or  how much easier all ""People"" films are - try mixing the two -  Animated Characters with People on a grand scale and the film is  AWESOME!
My observation: Jedi skills have obviously slid a bit from the  days of TPM.",953510400,2,2339,4.324074074074074

670046,1,6303454038,This movie contained too much CGI. I prefer the old Star Wars in which they used puppets and toys.,953337600,4,98,4.2105263157894735
670047,1,6303454038,"Face the facts folks, George Lucas was only out to steal your cash with this waste of celluloid.  I mean really, the man had nearly twenty years to create a story worthy of Star Wars and all he could come up with is this  excuse to merchandise his inevitable spin off computer games, toys and  lunch boxes.  If he really cared about the fans or the Star Wars universe  don't you think he might have spent just a little more time in developing a  plot and characters that could at least have been half way interesting?
  Besides the lack of a plot and interesting characters there was also a  noticeable lack (and I find this the most tragic of all) of a heart to this  film.  With the other SW films you at least had a feeling that cast and  crew had a love for what they were doing and this some how carried over  into the film itself.  With SWTPM all you get is a complete lack of  emotional highs or lows that made the first three movies so much fun to  watch.  I think part of this is due to George Lucas' insistance on so much  CGI, there is so much of it in fact that you actually feel as though you  are watching a cartoon or a very long and tedious video game.  I dunno but  it seems to me that too much CGI, no matter how good, only serves to make a  film look too smooth, too polished and, well darnit, too fake looking.  But  I guess the real reason for this lack of heart must lie with Mr. Lucas'  script and lack of concern for any real character development.  Proof  positive I feel that George must surround himself with ""yes""  people.  Surely someone should have warned him about Jar Jar!
  Its  obvious that Mr. Lucas wasn't doing a lot in the way of directing his cast  either.  Most of the actors seem to be just reading their lines and not  even trying to convey any kind of emotion with what they are saying.  Maybe  its just been too long between films for George to remember how to make a  good one.  He has been quoted as saying that the reason for the delay in  production of Episode 1 was that he was waiting for SPFX technology to  catch up with his imagination.  After seeing this film I couldn't decide  whether to laugh or cry at the irony of that statement.",953251200,7,2188,4.171084337349398
670178,4,6303454038,"I was suprised by the level of thrashing TPM received from critics and the public alike- it appears that many were expecting serious depth in addition to the requisite visual effects.  But Lucas made it clear from the start  that the SW series was and is intended for KIDS... not adults.  The  characters are cartoonish and the plot is predictable, sure, but that's no  different from ANH, ESB, and RTJ.  The difference, I'm afraid, is in us...  those of us who saw the originals as kids, anyways.  But for the 5-12 year  old set, TPM is as dazzling and inspiring as ANH was for us 23 or so years  ago.  Right now a million young boys are daydreaming about being Anakin,  racing pods (which not even the adults can do!) and learning how to use the  force, while a million young girls fantisize about being a queen who goes  on adventures in disguise, like Amidala.  TPM is fulfilling its goal- kids  are really connecting with this movie.
So turn off that internal critic  and think like a kid again- you'll find that Episode One is as fun and  imagination-inspiring as you expect a Star Wars movie to be.",953251200,4,1105,4.494949494949495
670179,5,6303454038,"I loved this movie.  It is a movie that the whole family can enjoy together, a myth for our times you might say.  Unlike most movies out today where they're either specifically directed at small children, teens(who  seem to have nothing but partying on thier minds), or adults, the Phantom  Menace has appeal for all moviegoers. Although there is violence in the  movie, there is no ""gore""(blood or body parts shooting all over  the screen) so even small children can enjoy the story.  It enabled me to  enjoy an epic tale of good versus evil with my children(they loved it)one  that was a huge part of my life when I was young.  The whole order of the  Jedi and the way they view the universe is definately a positive influence  for a child, unlike the meaningless fighting in ""pokemon"" or  similar popular icons.  What it boils down to is the fact that it is an  excellent all around movie building on characters that we all know and want  to know more about, and giving us a little taste of who and why the  ""Jedi"" are.  On a final note jar-jar is not that bad, if you look  back through the other 3 films you'll see that r2 & 3po are a sort of  comic relief.......the case is the same for jar-jar.",953251200,14,1201,4.34841628959276

I had looked forward with great anticipation to seeing it, only to be extremely irritated.  I almost walked out of the theatre halfway through it.

The story (in the original Star Wars) was  wonderful but we never knew where the characters came from or why they were  in the positions they were in.  This is where Phantom Menace comes  in.
The Phantom Menace starts at the beginning and shows the characters  that started the whole thing.  In addition it answered some questions that  Star Wars fans had for a long time, as well as created new questions that  will be answered in the next two movies.

Obi Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jin are easily the two  coolest, most well done characters in the whole film. Jar Jar Binks is  incredibly annoying as an alien thing, and all the other characters are  just plain dull. It seems as if the whole point of the movie was to cash in  on the Star Wars craze and make even more money. (Although many people will  say that George 'made it for the fans') I must say, the lightsabre battle  at the end was truely stunning. Too bad everything else in the movie  wasn't.

The special effects in The Phantom Menace were  outstanding.  The pod race and the jedi's duel with Darth Maul are worth  buying this video.

George Lucas has without doubt satisfied his  own minions of fans whilst encapturing the millions of young imaginations  who were deprived of the previous three outings.

True, the midiclorian concept is borderline  ridiculous, as is Anakins ""immaculate"" conception.  Anakin is  introduced, as is Obi-Wan, and Palpatine.  The ENTIRE POINT OF THIS MOVIE  WAS TO SHOW HOW PALPATINE WENT FROM BEING A SENATOR TO HEADING THE GALACTIC  REPUBLIC BY SUBTLE MANIPULATION.  Those of you who didn't see that from the  start, aren't true Star Wars fans.  This was about Palpatines rise to  power, his smirk at Qui-Gons funeral should have showed you that, along  with his comment to Anakin at the end.  I give it 4 stars for things like  the immaculate conception, and midicloreons, and Jar Jar binks.  It's the  basis for things to come, and that was the plot.  The light saber battle  gets 5 stars, as does the pod race.  (True, it ripped off Ben-Hur, but  Lucas knew that, he's not stupid.)  Buy it, it's part of a huge story, and  lays a foundation for all the other films.  (I also give it a 4 because NO  DVD?

And objectively, what can I say?  This movie stunk up the joint.  With the unlimited time and money to put together a masterpiece, Mr. Lucas  instead gave us great advertisement for the toy line, no plot line to speak  of, horrible dialog, atrocious character development, and overall just an  insipid waste of my time and money.  This movie was not written.  It was  manufactured.  The characters were one-dimensional, dull, lifeless,  uninspiring.  In short, it was a far cry from everything I loved about the  first three movies.
I give it two stars, instead of the one star it  probably deserves, for the special effects.  At least they managed to get  that right, even if it was at the expense of every other aspect of the  movie.  While I was wowed by the exstensive and intricate visual display,  the underlying plot and themes bored and disgusted me, and detracted from  what little good there was in the movie.
I hope that before the next  chapter is released, someone involved in the creative process actually  acknowledges that there are people out there with intellect that would at  least like to have it stirred every now and again when they watch movies.

Keeping that in mind, this movie is brilliant.  I introduces so many elements of the Star Wars saga, while maintaining a voice all it's  own.  This movie, by the way, is the most jaw dropping two and a quarter  hours of film you have or will (until Episode 2) see.
The Pod Race and  the final battle will not let you take a breath (that's a good thing!) and  contain images the likes of which you won't forget.  The music is  marvelous, and should definatley been nominated (and won) best original  score at the academy awards.
Okay Folks, The Not so good parts- The  acting is kind of stiff and first time viewers will find Jar-Jar Binks  annoying.

FINAL CRITICISM-
I know many  many people have said the same thing and I will repeat it- I WANT  DVD!  But George Lucas wins, I will buy this edition April 4th  (*punk*!) and when DVD comes out, THAT too.  And I recommend everyone else  does the same. :)rrrrrrrrr!",952905600,,1238,4.4375
670337,2,6303454038,"The points of departure that characterize the differences between Episode One and the original trilogy are vast and puzzling. First of all, the incredible lack of defining attributes (even archetypal ones) for any of  the characters. Everyone seems to be a reserved, conditioned automoton  lacking any human qualities. Secondly, the childish, sketch comedy humor  that would be more at home on a FOX sitcom. Jar-Jar is clumbsy (ha-ha),  Jar-Jar got farted on (ha-ha), Jar-Jar steps in dung (ha-ha). Thirdly, the  immature plotting style that ends up leaving everything to fantastic  coincidence. I demand someone to show me the equivalent of Anakin's joyride  or Jar-Jar's ""heroics"" in the original trilogy. And finally, a  reliance on computer generated effects to cover up the first three  departures. The Episode One effects have an completely different feel that  those of the original trilogy - instead of existing to augment the story  they exist to mask deficeits (what's up w/ the two underwater monsters?).  Of all the people that I have seen this film with only one person I know  actually liked it. He claims it is better than A New Hope because of the  effects - bigger battles, more aliens, faster vehicles, cooler fight  scenes. etc. To me SW movies aren't about the how ""big"" Lucas can  go w/ his set pieces but rather the feeling you got from watching them.  Episode One is completely devoid of feeling on any level.  All in all,  however, this film towers above the conventional trash churned out by  Hollywood. For true Star Wars fans it is an opportunity to have a good  laugh (""There's always a bigger fish"" did he actually say that)  and hope that Lucas can muster some of the same emotions that made Episodes  4-6 so great in the next installment.",952905600,9,1769,4.882154882154882

It is refreshing to know that there is still hope for  the science fiction media realm.  A savior from all the ""monsters are  coming to kill us, and take over our world just because it is there""  movies that we are constantly forced to swallow.  Thank you Mr. Lucas for  giving us worlds we would LIKE to visit, and even if Jar Jar is obnoxious,  I'm sure there are plenty of us out here that would love to go to the  Gungan city for a visit.

The acting was good, effects were awsome, story was - well  certainly as good as the others.  I think it is great to see additional  pieces of the story unfold.  Also, to many of the people that did not care  for it - this part of the whole SW story, according to Lucas, is the least  interesting.  The reason why he made the original Star Wars the first movie  to be released was because he thought it was the most interesting of the  entire story.  I have two complaints though - one about the film and  another about the video release.  First, my complaint about the film is  that the effects were great and all of the ships were cool too, but the  ships and other things look more ""advanced"" than the ones in the  ""older"", original SW movies even though The Phantom Menace is  supposed to be set earlier in time (think of cars in the 1960's to the cars  today.)  Second, I am a little po'd that the DVD version of The Phantom  Menace is not being released with the VHS versions - the obvious reason is  to make more money - George Lucas: Your fans love SW, but that isn't a good  way to treat your fans - RELEASE THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY and The Phantom  Menace on DVD - Star Wars on DVD will surely be awsome - don't make your  loyal fans wait anymore...Ok, I've spoken my peace.",952732800,2,1513,4.11340206185567

The special effects were absolutely amazing, but I feel that  the effects undermine the effects on the previous films. Afterall, mankind  is supposed to evolve, not decline, technologically speaking.

I think the lack of using life-size props  and scale models took away from some of the realism that the old films  carried.  It is also sad to see that with our technology advances the  spacecraft looks more high-tech than the stuff in the first films, causing  the story line to be out of kilter.",952732800,,634,4.621621621621622

But of course, all of these fans have forgotten these points,  and dissect and over analyse the new star wars film as if it was the second  coming of Shakespear.  Bottom line: George's target audience was 10 year  old boys (just like the original trilogy)  not grown adults.  My kids loved  it.  It had flashy visuals just like the original trilogy (and lousy acting  like the original trilogy).  Anyone who thinks that Star Wars is  ""American mythology"", or is primarily intended for 30 year olds,  needs to get a life.  Its a kids movie, pure and simple.  Remember: If you  want a sophisticated plot with gripping drama, watch star trek. If you want  lavish special effects and intense action, watch star wars.",952560000,2,1064,4.811111111111111

LIGHTSABER BATTLES and PODRACES saved  the movie for me....at least the second time I saw it in the movie theatre.  Anyway, I strongly believe that the trilogy is a million times better than  this lame introduction to the series.
Nevertheless, I do recommend to any  ""anti starwars fan"" to keep a good 100m from any cinema playing  the movie so as to avoid any mishap.",952560000,2,546,4.645833333333333

For those of us who saw ""theoriginals"" in the theater, and have enjoyed them ever since, this movie was in no way a let-down . . . with the one exception of Jar Jar. We could have done without him.
As someone mentioned earlier, George Lucas has every right to leave loose ends in this movie. Why on earth would he want to give everything away in the first new movie?  There would be nothing left for eps II or III.
Regardless of what format is available to us currently, this movie brought back many childhood memories, and allowed the little child in me to live once again outside of the real world and invited me in to a realm of alternate worlds that could only be experienced by the die-hard Star Wars fan. Thank you, George, for your wonderful movies. We look forward with anticipation to the next two.",952560000,4,891,4.4
670420,5,6303454038,"...when we saw the first trilogy. As we got older, our tastes became more sophisticated. No wonder so many people were disappointed with The Phantom Menace! They expected Lucas would provide another mind-blowing experience  -- even though we knew what to expect.
But Phantom follows the same basic  path that all hero stories follow -- the hero discovered, the hero defined,  and then, one of two results: the hero triumphant or the hero destroyed.  Luke was triumphant, whereas Anakin will be destroyed. There won't be much  variation on the theme itself.
The main complaint I've heard, though, is  that the movie is ""goofy,"" being oriented toward kids! Hilarious,  because this presumes that the first trilogy was not -- despite the goofy  robots, the spirit of good versus evil, the mass marketing of toys, etc.,  that followed. Growing up with a movie makes all the difference, I  suppose.
In the end, Phantom is pure Star Wars. The heroic struggle  against insidious forces, the beautiful arrangement of effects that blows  your mind away, the pure escapism from EVERYTHING to do with everyday life  -- it's wonderful. I recommend that, before you watch the flick, you try to  recapture a sense of wonder that we all had as children, leave behind the  sophistication that kids never possess, and immerse yourself in the story.

When I went to see this movie for the first time I had one hope:  That it would be better than Return of the  Jedi.
Maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much.  While everyone else was  expecting it to be better than all three original Star Wars movies  combined, I was simply hoping that it would be better than the weakest  episode so far.  And like the original trilogy it keeps up the spirit of  the old Saturday Matinee Serials that were a primary source of inspiration  for this series.
I concede, the dialogue was not as sharp as in the first  2 Star Wars movies, but at least nobody who was supposed to be quick witted  didn't lamely proclaim to a villain ""We have powerful friends"".  Also there were no Ewoks which is another point in the argument that this  movie was better than Jedi.
The special effects were, well, truly  special, successfully evoking and expanding images of Fritz Lang's  Metropolis.
And every single time a lightsaber lit up this was the  coolest, most exciting movie in years.
Those lightsabers were lit up a  lot.
As far as complaints about character development goes, when Lucas  first made Star Wars, he didn't know it was going to be a hit & he  could do the sequels, so he made the movie work as a singular  entity.
This movie Lucas knows will have a sequel, so he doesn't care  about loose ends.  He will be able to tie them off in Episodes II and III.  Hopefully while still maintaining the old-fashioned movie serial charm that  has infused all of the Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies.",952387200,5,1637,4.39799331103679

670563,5,6303454038,"First, I hate it when I read reviews that attempt to evaluate a movie to see if it has some wonderful moral or social message to send.  I say HOGWASH.  I choose to evalute a movie for what it is, and in the case of  The Phantom Menace, it is a Science Fiction movie that precedes the  original StarWars Trilogy.
First, as the movie open with the famous:  ""A long time ago in a galaxy far far away...."", then the  thundering Star Wars score I instantly reverted back to a 13 boy {I am now  36} with chills moving up my spine as I emerge myself into this wonderful  Science Fiction movie.
Some of the things that I bring back from the move  is how good I felt when I left the theater.  I particularly like the way  certain things were assumed that you already knew like the Jedi-Knights.  They never had to explain who they were because we already knew.  I really  enjoyed the continuity from that aspect.
I thought that the charaters  interacted with each other very well which helped to move the story along  smoothly.  I found the FX outstanding.  It really kept me on the edge of my  seat with the pod race and the light-saber battles.  The villians were  extremely well done and I was particularly please to see the original  emperor from revenge of the Jedi return to the Phantom Menace.
In a  nutshell Was it a great Sci-Fi Movie?...Yes! Did I feel good after it was  over?....Yes.. Would I go see it again?...yep (3 times in fact) Should you  buy the tape?....yes (but only because Lucas is being a weenie about  releasing it to DVD}",952300800,37,1539,4.368794326241135

However, it seems that Lucasfilm took more time making it groundbreaking graphically, but didn't spend enough time  directing it like the others.  The trilogy was awesome when it was made and  the Special Edition is awesome now.  Episode 1 is still really cool, but  not as well done as the original trilogy, as far as directing goes.  Also,  by adding Jar Jar, who is a part comical/part stupid character, they are  aiming Episode 1 toward younger viewers, making it a little boring for  older viewers.  It am glad that it does not have any bad content, but I  wish it wasn't quite as ""cute"".  The original didn't have much  bad content, and it was still very enjoyable to people of all ages.  Episode 1's Jar Jar can get pretty annoying to the older viewers, and the  comic relief provided by Jar Jar is pathetic compared to that of Han Solo.  However, I still give Episode 1 five stars because it is true Star Wars  material and a must own for any Star Wars enthusiast.",952300800,4,1068,4.526315789473684

A few years ago as a fourth grade teacher, I was fed up with the kids thinking  that Independance Day was the greatest Sci Fi they had ever seen, so I  showed them the original trilogy. They were slightly bored with the  beginning of Star Wars but were totally mesmerized by the battle for the  Death Star and the revelations in Empire. They literally stood up and  cheered when the horn blew and the Ewoks began to attack the  Stormtroopers. That is when I realized who these stories were for. Adults  love the mythology and effects but this is all a fantastic Fairy tale, in  the tradition of all the great epics. This is why I enjoyed The Phantom  Menace so much. Mr. Lucas did not suddenly change his story to an Aliens  Starship Troopers carnage fest. He continues with a solid story with enough  action,humor and yes silly comedy for all of us. The final 25 minutes where  he deftly handles FOUR action scenes at the same time puts this movie up  there with the first one.

670568,4,6303454038,"When I first heard about these prequel stories back in 1980, I have waited since for this movie to come out. And now...here it is-here it is, indeed...  Well, I must confess this Star Wars installment dose not have  that same ""edge"" if you will, that the Classical Trilogy has. The  acting by Jake LLoyd and Natalie Portman was not up to par-hardly. I think  much more screen time should have been given to the evil Darth Sidious and  Darth Maul- and less screen time given to Jar Jar Binks. Truth be told,  this movie has more of a Disney look (shudder) than being a Lucasfilm.  Now, with that said, there are redeeming factors to this motion picture as  well. Clearly, the Pod Race scene was fantastic, cut straight from the  grandiose cloth of Ben-Hur. The Lightsaber scenes-Federation Trade battle  droids, Tatoonie desert, and finally Darth Maul on Naboo-were Magnificent.  Also, the underlying plot with Senator Palpatine subtly manipulating the  circumstnaces so he can position himself to become Chancellor was also  impressive-an area which Mr. Lucas should of have greatly focused on.  Finally, the scenes with Jedi Master Yoda(Frank Oz returning as Yoda's  voice) were very welcoming.  With those redeeming characteristics, I  give The Phantom Menace 4 stars in the overall sense. And it must also be  kept in mind that this movie is the set-up movie for the rest of the Star  Wars Saga. Now as we go into Episode II, everything is now in place:  Palpatine (aka Darth Sidious, if you ask me)is Chancellor. Anakin Skywalker  and Obi-Wan Kenobi are starting a friendship while the seedlings of romance  with Anakin and Amidala have been planted. Just as the trailer pitch said  ""Every Saga Has a Beginning..."" That is exactly how one should  look at this movie-A beginning; a set-up story for something larger to  come. Yes, Episode I dosen't own up to the substantial quality of the  Classical Trilogy, that is certain. However, with everything taken into  account, it does serve it's foundational purpose for those movies and the  coming Episodes.  Watch it as it is-the opening story to a larger saga-and  enjoy.",952214400,49,2124,4.901408450704225
670569,2,6303454038,"The exhilarating, adrenaline rush of virtually all three of the first STAR WARS films has been replaced here by a mechanical special-effects-driven script that has all but lost the emotional core that made the saga such a  rare, gorgeous feast.  Only a few moments between young Anakin and his  mother have the heart evident in the first few films.  While the effects  are breathtaking, it is hard to rev yourself up for a movie when you care  little about the people/characters in it.  Jar Jar was a misfire, to be  sure, but the only new or old characters that are compelling are Anakin's  mom and Darth Maul, who has way too little to do. And I also felt that this  movie was much more of a commercial for merchandising, in other words built  for a very young audience, whereas the first three appealed to all ages  because of their mythic themes.  Virtually all of the name stars here are  wasted, though I believe that Ewan McGregor could have been powerful if he  had something to do.  Of course I cannot wait for the next installment, and  hope against hope that the creative genius behind this saga, Mr. Lucas, can  once again locate his fertile imagination and set our hearts on fire again.",952214400,5,1199,4.5754716981132075

There will never be another Star Wars and this saga deserves its place as the foremost example of american culture  there is. These films should go into a time capsule and be burried for 1000  years as our decendants will undoubetly want to relieve this fun  fantasy.
This episode does well to capture the feeling and grandeur of  the originals in such a way as to suggest that merely months have gone by  since ""A new hope"" was on the big screen for the first time. The  story is captivating, and the characters are interesting, yes, even Jar  Jar. Although I too did not really appreciate him until I read the  book.
My only complaint, it went too fast, both in story telling speed  and time. 2 hours was hardly enough to satisfy this die hard SW fan who has  been waiting for 17 years to see how it all started. And the story telling,  while true to Lucas' passion for speed, went too quickly from one scene to  another. IMHO

670692,5,6303454038,"To summarize in advance:  ""The Phantom Menace"" is a richly nuanced movie that can only be appreciated fully over the course of several viewings.  Here's why:
It is difficult to imagine a task more difficult  than the one George Lucas undertook with ""The Phantom Menace"".  After creating one of the richest and popular science fiction universes to  appear on film or in print (three of the most popular movies of all time  and dozens of supplementary novels), he undertakes to show us how that  universe came to be.  How did the father of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa  Solo become Darth Vader?  Who was their mother and what ever happened to  her?  How was it that a republic that had stood for thousands of years  succumb to the machinations of an ""evil emperor"" and become the  ""empire""?
The answers to such questions are not likely to be  any simpler than the historical paths that turned the Wiemar Republic into  Nazi Germany, and to the dissapointment of many viewers, George Lucas does  succumb to the easy path and deliver simple answers.  Every movie in the  Star Wars saga is different.  The young heros of ""A New Hope""  stumble, again and again, from a bad situation to worse as the  ""Empire"" attempts its final consolidation of power.  ""The  Empire Strikes Back"" is a tale of survival as the Emperor figures out  what foiled that consolidation and attempts to turn that situation to  advantage.  ""The Return of the Jedi"" is a tale of complex and  intersecting plans on a collision course that ends in the climatic undoing  of the Emperor's schemes and the redemption of Luke Skywalkers  father.
""The Phantom Menace"" is the multilayered beginning of  the events that make those movies possible, and is impossible to fully  appreciate with a single viewing.  We meet the young Darth Vader when he is  still a good, wide-eyed and optimistic boy, but a boy unlike any the  ""Jedi-order"" has ever encountered before.  We meet his mother,  enigmatic ""There is no father"" led some to (I think inaccurately)  make ""Virgin Mother"" allusions when the nuances of her statement  suggest a great deal more.  We meet the future emporer while he is still a  Republic senator, watch him create a political crisis (""The Phantom  Menace"") out of nothing (when is any bureaucracy efficient or  completelly free of corruption), and then turn that into vastly enhanced  political power (literally the beginning of the emperor's rule).
All  these introductions and machinations come with a price that ""A New  Hope"" never had to pay.  Detail and Nuance matter, and there is  ultimately too much movie.  Faced with some of the same problems in ""A  New Hope"", George Lucas turned it into three movies.  Having already  laid out the movies that follow from ""The Phantom Menace"", he  turned instead to cuts that are sometimes so tight you don't hear things  the first time you see the movie.  The screen is so rich with image that  you simply don't see things that really matter the first time through.  The  movie improves with every viewing, and so long as the smaller screen and  revised format doesn't rob us of the detail, it will improve with each  viewing on VideoTape.  I believe that time will be much kinder to this  movie than the critics were to its initial release, and I certainly  recommend both it and the novelization (which complement each other nicely)  to all.",952128000,,3365,4.782837127845885

For those who did not like the acting of Jake  Lloyd and others need only to look at the original movie.  Mark Hamill is  not exactly Shakespeare.

A whole generation of young men (and some women) had waited a lifetime for the follow-up from 1970s prodigy George  Lucas. Tragically, Lucas used his artistic freedom - which would have been  the envy of Chaplin or Welles - to create a glossy children's film rather  than a worthy successor to his original trilogy which can truly be said to  appeal to all ages.
That said, don't believe those who say that this  movie is ""only"" about special effects. The look and feel is in many places  majestic, and the visual references are inspired. Witness the influences of  African art, classical architecture, legends of Atlantis, great movie  moments (Ben Hur, Metropolis) and more. Add to this a whole series of story  elements which, sadly, are greater than the sum of their parts - such as  the explanation of how a corrupt bureaucracy allows a peaceful trading  federation to slide into an oppressive dictatorship - and you have a flawed  but fascinating piece of entertainment.

Do you know what they  call an emotional Jedi?  A Sith Lord!  The people who played Jedi played  their characters the way they should be played.
As for the complaints  that it is not as good as the others, name one thing that isn't better.  It  has better-known actors, better special effects, and the Jedi are way  cooler!  For those who miss Han Solo, I have to say that I hate his  character like some hate Jar-Jar Binks.  The only good thing he did was  father Jacen and Jaina, and in the meantime he was busy being an arrogant  idiot!
Another complaint I read was about Queen Amidala liking Anakin  Skywalker.  Why not?  She's only five years older than he is, and my Father  is five years older than my Mother.  In some cultures, an age difference of  ten years is common in married couples.  I don't tell me that in the future  that there are class systems people can't marry out of.  Give me a  break.

670794,2,6303454038,"Ever since I saw Star Wars for the first time, I was impressed and immediately was taken to a distinct and varied universe that spawned a new franchise in my life. Unfortunately, hype has repeated itself and Lucas  gave anticipating audiences a dramatic decline in what anyone could call an  epic. Maybe the most anticipated cinematic event in the history of  filmmaking, but far from the great film. The pod race is worth the  admission alone, but as for an unoriginal story and horrible use of the  Star Wars license, this movie just doesn't cut it, and you'll find yourself  surprisingly sleeping through half of it.",951696000,,619,4.7924528301886795
670795,2,6303454038,"I am a huge Star Wars fan from way back, and I was amazed at how slow and uninteresting this film was.  The pacing was just plain uneven.  I sat in the theatre, stone-faced, waiting for something... ANYTHING!... to happen.  Once the podrace sequence got started, I could finally feel the hairs on my  arm stand up.  There it was, the STAR WARS MAGIC!  I looked at my watch,  and an hour had already passed before a real moment of excitement had been  achieved.
Admittedly, the film does pick up a bit after that.  The  Coruscant scenes are pretty interesting, and the lightsaber duel is  technically amazing, albeit emotionally uninvolving.  C'mon, this is  supposed to be SPACE OPERA!  You want to root for the good guys and boo and  hiss the bad guys!  All the characters are so undeveloped (DARTH MAUL ISN'T  BAD ENOUGH! ) and gray that they just look like action figures.
Mr.  Lucas, please... you have given the world a great universe that has  enchanted generations.  Please DO NOT feel the need to prove yourself as a  director/screenwriter.  It's been over 20 years, and it shows.  Let someone  else drive the car for a stretch.  Thank you.",951696000,,1148,4.62
670796,4,6303454038,"I must admit that while most people are big Star Wars fans, I am a huge Star Wars fan. I knew that no film could live up to the hype Phantom Menace had received, and with that in mind I went in without any expectations. Is  Phantom Menace 'Star Wars'? Yes, but it doesn't live up to the previous  three story-wise, special effects notwithstanding. Phantom Menace suffers  mostly from poor writing, the introduction of midi-chlorians as a way to  explain one's connection to the Force was a catastrophic mistake. In a few  sentences Lucas stripped away all of the mystery and majesty from the Force  and summed it up with a Treknobabble explanation that space here doesn't  allow me to explain. There were other gripes, but nothing quite as glaring  as the midi-chlorian nonsense. On the up side, Ewen McGreggor and Liam  Neesan do more than enough to hold one's interest, and when the Jedi are on  screen you captivated by the specticle of flashing lightsaber blades and  the awesome power of Jedi Knights. Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker is  cloying in squeaky-clean cuteness. Natalie Portman was a joy to see on the  screen, but the character was too stiff, let's hope Queen Amidala losens up  in the second film. And, as sure as I was that I wanted to see Jar Jar  Binks hewn in lightsaber pate, he actually didn't annoy me as much as I  thought he would. Visually, the film scores big with people who like the  best special effects ILM can produce, but as with the end battle of Return  of the Jedi, the end battle in the Phantom Menace suffers from the 'too  much too fast and not enough time to enjoy it', too many zipping vehicles  on the screen at one time, and lacked the graceful elegance of the end  battle of A New Hope. The centerpiece of the Phantom Menace is the epic  lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul, and is the  best part of the film with its heart pounding kinetics. When I see better  spaceship designs in computer games like Starcraft than in a Star Wars  film, I'm given to wonder. Doug Chiang is an excellent artist, but his  conservative vehicle designs fell flat. It also lacked the humor and sense  of fun had by the other three films and its tone more serious than it  really needed to be. Bring back Joe Johnston, Bill Berg and Phill Tippet to  the design team and see what happens.",951609600,,2337,4.5107398568019095

Phantom Menace es diferente, lo s.  Sin embargo, tiene la misma  habilidad de dejar al cineasta pidiendo ms y deseoso de ver la segunda  pelcula. La inocencia del joven Anakin.  El misticismo de Quai-Gon y  Obi-wan.  La belleza de la princesa Amidala.  La maldad de la federacin.  Los efectos especiales son impresionantes.  El combate final de los Jedis y  Darth Maul fue excelente.  La batalla espacial fue fenomenal y la carrera  en Tattoine fabulosa.

670798,3,6303454038,"With the release of Episode I, a new and old generation of Star Wars ""buffs"" gathered...the reactions were very mixed.  The biggest of the flaws to this movie was the fact that Lucas had diverted from an  audience of older, more mature thinkers of the original trilogy, to a more  child-like movie for the younger viewers (especially the dreaded Jar Jar  Binks)...the actors and actresses in this movie did not do as well as the  such-which for the trilogy.  The way that Jake Lloyd acted out this movie  is in comparison to the way that most children would act out movies in the  early 1940s...also the movie was made to be more ""Americanized""  than a real distant, and unknown culture.  Yes, Lucas has lost his dark,  spiritual, and intellectual touch...",951609600,2,756,4.7384615384615385
670799,1,6303454038,"Being a lifelong Star Wars fan, I was bitterly disappointed with this film. I had hoped that Lucas would not make the same mistakes with this one that he made with Return of the Jedi, but he made them all, and more. But  it won't matter, ultimately; there are too many fans who seem to enjoy  childish nonsense, and this film made a fortune, and so will the next two.
I had several problems with this movie, namely, the childishness of it,  the stupid ""virgin birth"" gimmick, and the insipid dialogue.
To be fair, I went into this one with low expectations. I was surprised  to find, however, that I really liked it...the first 10 minutes anyway.  This actually made it worse. My hopes were lifted, then shot down. Those  first ten minutes (before Jar Jar showed up) had intrigue and great Jedi  action. If only the whole movie had been that way. As soon as Jar Jar  appears, the entire production takes on an overwhelming feeling of  stupidity. Lucas obviously went way out of his way to attract the kiddies  in this film. What he apparently fails to realize, or has simply forgotten,  more likely, is that kids will like it no matter what. Lasers, lightsabers  and spaceships will make the kids love it. That's what made me, as a kid,  love Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. The kiddie stuff just took a  potentially great movie and dragged it down to the level of a Saturday  morning cartoon, and a bad one at that.
The ""mitichlorians""  and the subsequent attempt to explain the Force added to the stupidity. And  the ""Anakin had no father"" bit was just plain insulting. I was  actually humiliated at that point, humiliated to be a Star Wars fan,  humiliated to be watching this garbage, humiliated to have been at the  first showing, especially.
The often stupid dialogue was also low-level  kid stuff. ""We're in trouble, R2! "" No kidding.
On the plus  side, I think that that whole rap about racial stereotypes in this film was  the result of a bunch of people who go looking for things to complain  about.
Overall, the film made me feel as if my entire childhood had been  a lie. But I've gotten over that..I can still enjoy the first films,  regardless of how much this one stunk.",951609600,11,2192,4.528061224489796
670800,5,6303454038,"But its easy to see why some people were disappointed with it.  After sixteen years, a lot of fans and critics were expecting the end-all of all summer action movies.  And by that standard, the movie does come up a  little short.  The bad guys are shadowy at best and their motives are  unclear; the good guys never really seem to be in any great danger.
But  evaluated on its own terms, the Phantom Menace is a very good movie.  Subtle, understated, sometimes a little slow, the movie sets up the  characters and relationships that will drive the next five films.  Storywise, the film is apparently simple - the resolution of a trade  dispute between a peaceful planet and a greedy trade federation.  But many  fans will recognize this conflict for what it is - the end of the Republic,  the beginning of the Empire, and the prelude to the Rebellion of the first  three Star Wars movies.  In a lot of ways the movie plays like the Hobbit,  a childrens story which sets the groundwork for a much larger and darker  tale.
The films visuals help to contribute to its storybook feel.  Brighter and more colorful, with more creatures, ships and planets than  ever before, this is easily the best looking Star Wars film ever.  Unlike a  lot of films, with a sprinkling of effects,- a cool alien, a cool shot,  here and there - the Phantom Menace washes the viewer in another galazy.  At times it can feel overwhelming, a little distracting from the story, but  by the end, you really feel you had visited a much different place.  Dont  listen to the people complaining about corny dialogue and flat characters.  Star Wars tells its story with visuals and the Phantom Menace delivers.",951609600,14,1678,4.6

670870,5,6303454038,"I am crazy about all things Star Wars, and even back in third grade when I din't like it there were rumors flying around about Episode One. When I went to see the movie I was the only one in my family who new what was  going on. I was extremely impressed by the graphics and artistic value of  this movie. I liked how it focused on the Jedi a lot more than the original  trilogy. Not to say this movie is better than the originals! I watch'em all  and read all the books and manga comics I can get my hands on. Episode One  is special to me because someday, when I'm like, 40 or something, I'll be  able to say ""I grew up when the Phantom Menace came out."" I'll  admit that the commercialization of this movie was a bit much, but I still  think this is the greatest movie of the Twenty First century!",951523200,,800,4.050955414012739

Past glamour is not all, but a fine movie will live forever. You feel it in  your heart when you watch one. Do you feel it when watching episode I? My  God, there's nothing there; nothing to relate to, nothing to touch you,  nothing deeply amusing.  Don't buy this.",951436800,2,409,4.075
670872,5,6303454038,"Well, my confidence in the ""critics"" has gone downhill since this came out.  They have been panning and trashing this movie since it came out . . . and they're totally wrong!  Am I a little biased?  Maybe.  I was 12 when Episode IV (the original Star Wars) came out and it had a  profound influence on my future interests.  The problem with the  ""critics"" out there is that they seem to put up blinders when  they see this movie, totally forgetting that it is 1/6th of a huge epic.  In doing so, they will miss many of the subtleties in this movie.  So many  things are set up in The Phantom Menace that half the time I found myself  scanning Episodes IV-VI through my head trying to fit the pieces  together...I have already been postulating events in the next two  installments.  George Lucas is a master world builder!  I was afraid that  he wouldn't be able to capture the look and feel of the originals.  Boy was  I wrong.  When John Williams' music kicks in, the the familiar scrolling  intro rolled by, I was transported back to 1977 all over again.  This is  definitely Star Wars!  The lightsaber duel at the end was phenomenal, and  the pod racing scene is incredible.  The next three years waiting for  Episode II is going to be grueling.  GREAT FUN!  Just remember that this  is 1/6th of an epic, the Trade Federation ISN'T the enemy in this  film...and Yoda pretty much says exactly what's going to happen to Anakin  and his mom in a later movie while talking to Anakin in the Jedi Council  Chamber.  There's more at work here than meets the eye.",951436800,9,1558,4.427046263345196
670873,3,6303454038,"This movie was a good starting plot for the six films.  We have some old characters, some that were alluded to in 4, 5, and 6 and alos ones that we are sure to see in the next two.  I, like many other viewers had a big  problem with Jar Jar but hey, be optimistic.  He isn't in the last three so  he could be on the casualty list.  Maybe Anakin gets tired of his antics,  embraces the dark side and slaughters him.  Otherwise, we should  ratethis film not in relation to the other three, but as a seperate film  altogether.  It was a good kids film, accessible to hardcore fans and  casual viewers.  The problem that I think most people had was that their  anticipation was held too high after over 15 years wait and they didn't get  what they expected.",951350400,5,753,4.204225352112676
670874,3,6303454038,"Well, as excited as one was at the premiere of Episode One, one could not help but feel a little uneasy. As the premier drew closer, the feelings were mixed. For one thing its star wars! It has to be good, on the other  hand there is no way this new Episode, what's it called..uh..The Phantom  Menace? could ever measure up to the old star wars, we have come cheerish.  Well in thinking so, we were right.  It seemed as if George Lucas had a  bunch of cool toys to play with for this movie, and some where along the  line he lost sight of what the original episodes portrayed. In this new  installment, the audience is swept from underwater chases to dog fights in  outer space, and never allowed to sit back and familiarize themselves with  these awsome settings. I can look back at the old trilogy and say, man I  really love that cantina scene, or Jabba's palace is the coolest! Looking  back at episode one, all that seems to come into view is Jarjar Binks's  annoying slapsticky (un)comic relief. Mr. Binks is an entire character which  has all the appeal of Chewbacca's blood chilling Tarzan scream in RotJ.  Moving along, Anakin Skywalker...man I don't know who that kid actor was,  but I do know he needs acting lessons and a good kick in the behind. He  almost ruined the whole damn thing! But lets be fair. Take away, JarJar and  pretend that Anakin is mute, and we have a great prequel. The plot is good,  the bad guys are excellent, the fighting scenes are fregin beautiful. And  it all builds up nicely for an exciting grand finale. All and all it's an  enjoyable fun-ride for the whole family and certainly worth the money.  Until episode 2....lets just hope Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't get the part of  Anakin Skywalker...because if he does, I'll be skywalking out of the  theatre. good night ps. Not releasing E1 on DVD is either the smartest  thing G L has done or the cruelest, most sadistical act of stupidity this  world has ever seen...",951350400,8,1955,4.517142857142857
670875,5,6303454038,"When seeing the original Star Wars Trilogy for the first time, I along with most (True) Star Wars fans were at the most impressionable time of our lives - we were kids. Since then, we have all become more cynical. And with  the release of the Phantom Menace, expectations were so unachievable, that  not even a Lucas/Spielberg/Cameron/Coppola pairing could meet them.
For  me, it was back to basics: Not only setting the platform for the following  five prequels, but getting the buy in from the younger viewers (as we once  did). Can you imagine if he had seen this for the first time in 1977? I  also don't see the extreme necessity in loading the Phantom Menace with  major character development - it would have been better, but it leaves us  gasping for more info. Now that's an opera!

670876,5,6303454038,"This is not only the best Star Wars movie ever, but this masterpiece is the best movie ever to cross the big screen.

The city of Naboo is beautiful with realistic waterfall,Natalie Portman did a great job in this  movie,she play Queen Amidala and Padme.

You can't seriously think that a movie that has been hyped for so long can actually make everyone  happy.  If you've seen the other Star Wars movies, try and think of this  while watching this installment:
This movie was made to bring up  questions of how some characters had evolved in the other movies from the  beginning.  It was also created to let the viewer in on a little history of  some other characters: in particular Ben Kanobi and Anakin Skywalker/Darth  Vader.  I think it did just that.  When seeing this movie, the best thing  to do, as I did, is to not go into it with any expectations.  Just watch  the movie and enjoy the ride it takes you on.  If it seems to be a little  open-ended, it's supposed to be that way.  That's how you get a  ""prequel"".  I am sure that Mr. Lucas knows what he is doing.  He's been doing it alot longer and better than most of us can say.  Just  sit back and enjoy his movies, and I think you will not be disappointed.  I  know I definitely wasn't after The Phantom Menace.",951264000,,1142,4.248826291079812
670879,5,6303454038,"This is a great addition to the saga.  I still don't understand why so many people think that they were betrayed by Lucas.
I can only say a couple of negative things about TPM:  1) It does have kind of a weak plot.  But, I think that this movie was only supposed be an introduction to the  primary characters.  I believe all plot-holes will be filled in with the  next movies. 2) George did get a little carried away with his CGI  technology.  Jar Jar became a central character when, actually, he should  have had about 25% less screen time.
Barring those two things, it was a  cool flick and a great introduction for the series.  The effects are  mind-numbing to the point where you HAVE to see it more than once so that  you can absorb all the images.  The climactic battle was awesome and puts  the lightsaber battles from the original trilogy to shame.
All in all,  I'd say that it wasn't as good as Star Wars or Empire Strikes Back, but I  liked it alittle better than Return of the Jedi.
And to all those who say  that there are racial stereotypes found in some of the aliens:  GET A  LIFE!  Anyone that says that Jar Jar Binks is a representative of an  African-American person is deluded and should get help.",951177600,34,1217,4.339285714285714
670998,5,6303454038,"Sure, there are naysayers.  There always will be.  Let's all keep in mind that Star Wars was panned by critics when it first arrived as well though.  I will agree, I rate this the weakest of the 4, but that's like picking  among 4 fine diamonds, 1 has to be the least among them, it doesn't make it  bad.  The characters weren't quite as touching as in the original trilogy,  but whose to say they won't grow to be so, over time, I believe they can.  Our way of looking at Star Wars changes over time, when I was younger, I  hated The Empire Strikes Back, because the good guys lost, but now, I find  it to be the strongest of the series.
The fight choreography surpasses  the first 3 by miles.  It can be a bit childish in its humor, but it is  meant for all generations.  Jar-Jar was a pain, but you know what, when I  watch the old ones, I get almost the same feeling about C3PO, he bugs the  hell out of me, not to mention those darned Ewoks, at times they can be  touching, like when the one gets killed by a blast and the other one tries  to help him up, finds him dead, and makes this sad mewing sound, but at  other times they were just childish. I think we've just reached a point  where the first 3 are so revered that there's no way TPM was going to live  up to it initially, but I believe over time, it will find its place among  the others, as a fitting preface to the struggles in the next 2 episodes.",951177600,2,1415,4.050724637681159
670999,4,6303454038,"The best thing about ""Star Wars Episode 1"" is that is completely consistant in tone, and point of view with the existing three movies. Which is to say, that is you enjoyed the first three movies, than ""The  Phantom Menace"" will be a real treat.  Unfortunately, this movie was  the victim of a lot of hype and impossible expectations, which was why it  was prematurely trashed by too many people.  Like the other three  ""Star Wars"" movies, ""The Phantom Menace"" suffers from  some serious flaws and goofy choices:  The dialogue is often flat; those  aliens with the weird asian accents(! ); Jar-Jar's annoying antics, a  digital fart joke;  but it is certainly no worse than a lot of the material  in the original trilogy(the Ewak battle comes to mind.)  That being said,  I was by no means dissapointed in this rousing space adventure.  The movie  is really a lot of fun.  The effects have been lauded, but they are done  with a rare sense of wonder and imagination.  On the technical side the  movie is near perfect, from the costumes and make-up, to the design and art  direction, to the amazing fight choreography and the stunning music by John  Williams.  Some of the acting is inconsistant, or better to say that some  of the characters are not developed. Liam Neeson, however, holds the whole  movie together.  I can think of no better actor to play this part.  His  great presence and nobility are perfect.  Yet he's not the ""perfect  knight"" of Alec Guiness.  He's a Jedi Knight, definitely one of the  good guys, but he's also kind of grizzled, and worldly, very much like a  samuri from a Kurasawa movie.  His relationship with Jake Lloyd in the  movie is sweet, and touching.  This is very much a movie about father  figures, part of a greater story about fathers and sons.  This is not so  much an official ""act"" in the greater story but more a  prelude  to a five act story.  Its the great unfolding of a larger story. In that  sense also the movie shines.  We see the story carefully unfolding.  While  the dialogue may not be great the actual storytelling does not falter.  In  that sense the writing is actually good and rich.  Here we also set of a  tale ofintrigue that was never present in the other movies.  I think the  other two movies will go in darker directions than this fun but giddy  prequel.",951177600,6,2319,4.556372549019608

People can kick and scream and complain about PM,  but the fact is, it was brilliantly cast, directed and produced with some  of the most incredible CG work in the world.

A few minutes later,  I was swept away to another world...well, universe, with the words ""A  long time ago in a galaxy far, far, away...""  Around 3 a.m., I  staggered out of the theatre, utterly stunned.

Much like Episode 1, it is part of a trilogy. For those who  say they are ""TRUE"" Star Wars fans, and disliked Ep1, they are  full of Bantha Poodoo, fans you are not. I believe if you see ths film as  what it is, groundwork for the next 2 movies, it sets the stage perfectly.  What is the event that makes Anikin turn to the dark side? What are the  motives of Palpatine? Where did all the Jedi go? And on, and on. I think  people go into this film wanting to hate it. Wanting to disect it, and  dislike it for petty reasons. ""Darth Maul wasn't in it enough"",  niether was vader in Ep4. ""Jar Jar is just comic relief"", so was  C3-P0 in all the other films. ""The plot is terrible and  incomplete"", watch Empire Strikes Back, by itself, very, VERY,  incomplete. It will never replace the original 3, only complement them. Ask  yourself this, if I never seen Ep4 - Ep6. Would I hate Ep1 as much? I think  not, sure it had flaws. And yes, it was far from perfect. But worst film of  the year? No. And if it was sooo horrible, why is it the 4th highest  grossing film of all time?  If you are looking for high quality acting,  sorry, it isn't in the spirt of Star Wars to be polished. Visually  stunning? Very. Cheezy? At times. Should you see/buy this film? Definately.  Just too bad we have 4 years to wait to see how it all ends....",951177600,3,1488,4.176056338028169

671006,3,6303454038,"While this movie certaintly provided entertainment in the form of cutting-edge computer generated graphics, it sorely lacked a strong, convincing plot to give the movie PURPOSE.  While some may correctly point  out that it is intended to be a prequel, this does not mean that it should  be devoid of a plot with substance.  Overall, the movie certainly has  merits (graphics, cast selection), it is riddled with too many flaws to  overlook.  This, combined with an anemic plot, reduces its rewatchability  and renders it sub-par when compared with the original Star Wars series.",951091200,,578,5.139784946236559
671073,1,6303454038,"There are many, many flaws in this movie. Its first and most overbearing flaw is that it was obviously intended to be a 'kiddy flick'. The computer-generated characters are practically cartoons. Some computer graphics in movies can be good, but adding in CG characters to a movie is  completely idiotic. You can tell that the actors did not see them, and it  is obvious that the actors were just pretending that the CG characters were  there. This does not come off too well in the final  presentation.
Furthermore, the acting is extremely bland. This is not  necessarily the fault of the actors, but rather a meaningless and boring  script with no redeeming qualities to it. I am sure that 'pretending' that  invisible CG characters were actually there took away from the actors'  enthusiasm as well. They just seemed to recite their lines without any  emotion whatsoever.
The presentation of the film seems rushed. Making a  good film is like making a good piece of music; there needs to be rests,  and periods of stress and release. The scenes in this movie jump from one  to the next without any time to let what the audience just saw to sink in.  This is kind of a moot point however, as there was nothing worthwhile to  sink in in the first place.
What is also annoying about this film is that  Lucas obviously intended it to be very politically correct; that's why  almost 0 people die, just robots and jar-jar binks characters. I believe  there were 3 people that died in the entire movie (I could be wrong on  this) You can't make a movie about large-scale warfare without  having people die; it is ridiculous. One would expect this from a kiddy  flick of course.
I was very much looking forward to this movie when it  came out. Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is one of my favorite movies  of all time. Unfortunately, Phantom Menace does not exhibit any of the  qualities that made Empire such a phenomenal film. The only people who like  Phantom Menace are a) dogmatic fans who think that Star Wars can do no  wrong, b) idiots who like it because it is the latest 'fad' and c)  philistines who have no appreciation for a good plot or character  development in a movie, and like anything that has good special effects in  it.  Flashy effects do not make a good movie however, as Lucas seems to  think. Hopefully he will not direct the next film, and the CG characters  will be scrapped.",951091200,10,2399,4.574117647058824

671076,5,6303454038,"Much has been said, both praise and criticism, of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. I will address elements of both arguments, in an attempt to give an objective review.
First, I feel expectations cause problems for  any movie.  After 26 years since the last picture, the expectations for  this 1st installment of the Star Wars saga were ridiculuous.  George Lucas  could have told any story at all and it would be a letdown.  Twenty years  of hype is quite a lot to unload in the course of two hours.
Second,  people have no concrete example of this type of a prequel concept.  The  closest example is Godfather II, but even that ""flashback"" was  bookended by a modern-day setting.  In the Phantom Menace, we are seeing  the beginning of an epic tale.  This story SHOULD BE a pale shadow of the  other films. It should also be a bright beacon.
The Phantom Menace is a  film meant to contrast life in the galaxy as we knew it in Episodes IV-VI.  It is NOT a period of civil war.  It is NOT a time of dictatorial  oppression.  As a result, the universe appears more colorful and alive.  In  this film, we see the groundwork, the first suggestions, that things aren't  as they have been.
Many characters in this film are underdeveloped.  They are left that way on purpose.  We knew very little about Ben Kenobi or  Han Solo either in Episode IV.  Their characters grew and developed  throughout the trilogy.  One major problem in appreciating Episode I is the  fact that in 20 years, people perceive the original trilogy much as one  picture.  Much of the criticism received about Episode I could be matched  identically with the criticism that Episode IV received in 1977.
The  plot is not weak, it is simple.  Like the beginnings of any myth or  folktale, the story must be simple.  What you find, though, are many layers  to pull back.  In this way, the story can apply to most people.  Greek  myths were shared not just to children, but adults as well.  Everyone could  find a valuable lesson in it.  This film makes statements against racism,  the separation of family, and the importance of leadership and loyalty.  Characters like Jar-Jar show that even people that may seem the most  incapable can accomplish great things.
People I know that enjoy this  movie the most tend to be people that haven't seen any of the other films.  They have no bias.  As Yoda said, ""You must unlearn what you have  learned.""  The visual arts and the sweeping music score draw you into  a whole other reality, if you let it.
 The story takes you on a journey,  Obi-Wan's journey, of maturity.  If you are mindful of the things that  happen in between, you might even learn something.",951091200,25,2677,4.576595744680851
671077,5,6303454038,"Think about this revelation alone: ""At last, we shall reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last, we will have revenge."" This alone ought to tell you what else 'out there' awaits us in the next movie  adventure {Hint:Who is the 'we' Maul is referring to?}. I got over Jar Jar  one of the first few times I saw the actual movie at the theatre and did so  knowing this had to lead to something bigger and better in the next motion  picture. Many questions were arisen. Why Darth Maul only used half of his  saber when attacking Qui Gon on Tattooine instead of both blades is one and  why Obi Wan did not 'flash' over to his mentor to help him when being  attacked by Maul much as he had earlier to escape the attack droids is  another. Where did all of the Trade Federation ships disappear to in the  battle at the end of the motion picture? These  curiousities will surely be  answered in Episode 2 as well as I am sure all of the others. The Phantom  Menace was well worth the wait, in my humbled opinoin. Recently I had the  chance to see for the first time Saving Private Ryanand must say this  excuse for taking up well over two hours of my time hardly had a deep  storyline and took forever to get to what turned out to be the obvious. The  Star Wars galaxy is vastly populated with many the unknown and in a few  years time, Episode 2 will easily erase any doubts we fans may have with  the end result of Episode 1.

671080,2,6303454038,"I, like many others waited long and hard for Star Wars 1 to come out.  I was extremely disappointed. In the first trilogy released, while there were three movies that were separate movies but tied together, Star Wars 1 just  seemed like the first installment in a miniseries.
The inclusion of  Jar-Jar Binks as a main character was, at best, a travesty.  He has neither  the warmth of R2D2 or the bumbling antics of C3P0.
I can only conclude  that, should George Lucas insist upon making the rest of the trilogy in  this vein, he'll lose more and more fans.  And should he continue to make  the last trilogy in the line, there'll be no one left to watch.",951004800,,654,4.428571428571429

I did think that it could have used a bit more development,  and there were a few things that could have been left out.  (Jar jar, most  of the Gung gan battle with the droids) The only problem with this movie  really was that the first three were such intense movies, with characters  of such presence that they made it a very very hard act to follow.  I  applaud Mr. Lucas on his choice of actors and actresses, but I think there  was just something lacking in their performance.  One of the great  things about Star Wars IV was the dark undertone.  Phantom just seemed made  more toward the 6 to 15 year old crowds, than the broad spectrum that makes  up the Star Wars Fan Clan.  In closing I would like to give my whole  hearted thanks to Mr. Lucas for allowing the ""Star Wars Phantom Menace"" to  be seen here in Kuwait on post, other wise I would still be wondering what  all the huha was about.

671082,5,6303454038,"Back in 1977, George Lucas pushed Hollywood's bar of quality up quite a few notches with ""Star Wars"".  For the past 22 years, Hollywood has been desperately trying to knock it back down.
In a day and age when  most TV shows and movies fall short of our expectations, ""Episode One:  The Phantom Menace"" is a much needed sigh of relief.  It's a great  film for kids and adults (who haven't forgotten how to be kids!)
If  you're looking to buy this movie on home video, please get the widescreen  edition.  (other formatted editions chop off about 43% of the screen.  In  other words, you can't put a long, rectangular screen into your square TV)
If you have a surround sound system, you're in for a real  treat!
Anyways, Lucas may not be the world's greatest director, but he  does have an excellent sense of screen composition.  Similar to ""Star  Wars"", ""Episode One"" has that old comic book / Saturday  Matinee Idol appeal.
Similar to ""Star Wars"", the acting is not  Shakespearean, but it IS charming.  Lucas put it best when he said in an  interview, ""...it's an uncynical film in a cynical world.""",951004800,5,1099,4.577319587628866
671196,3,6303454038,"Okay, let's state it plainly.
To those of you who think this is the greatest film ever made: get a clue.  This was not a perfect picture.
To those of you hailing it as the worst waste of film you've ever seen: don't  overreact.  It wasn't that bad.
There's more to the plot of this film  than many give it credit for.  Why do we care about some dumb trade war  over taxces and tarriffs?  We don't.  But that's not the point.  The entire  plot was simply a means to an end--the first step in the rise to power of  the Empire.
Palpatine orchestrates an otherwise unimpressive trade  dispute to gain control in the Senate.  Palpatine is also Darth Sideous,  Sith.  Thus, this film represents the beginning of the Sith's seizing of  power, the first seeds of the evil Empire that dominates by the  second/original/whatever trilogy.  At the same time, Lucas introduces  Anakin Skywalker, who also dominates the second trilogy--both thru his  presence as Darth Vader, and thru his offspring, Luke and Leia.
Thus, it  is a more complex plot than it seems on the surface.
Sure, there were  midichlorians (lame!) and Jar Jar (lame!) and a horrible first 20 or 30  minutes.  But the minute Qui Gon and Watto shake on the Pod Race bet, this  film takes off, and becomes a pretty good space opera ... which is all Star  Wars was ever meant to be.",951004800,,1334,4.5
671197,4,6303454038,"Gosh, what a great movie. . .  What is good about it?  The story!  Yes, the story.  If you feel that the movie is about a young boy that will eventually become Darth Vader, you are wrong.  Its not about Anakin.  The  action surrounds the Trade Federation blockade of Naboo.  I won't spoil the  movie for those that haven't seen it, but there are motivations behind this  blockade.  If you have seen this movie, think about this for a moment and  then re-evaluate. . .
The acting?  This is a spot of contention.  I feel  Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Ian McDiarmid and Pernellia August are  wonderful!  Ewan McGreggor doesn't get a chance to shine as he does in  other movies (for lack of participation.)  He only has about 15 lines  total.
All technical aspects of the movie are outstanding.  I won't go  into much detail here.  Just read some of the other reviews. . .
Was it  perfect?  No.  At first I didn't like Jar Jar, but he's grown on me since  my first viewing. Jake Lloyd is not up to the task of showing emotion  (especially when saying goodbye to his mother) in his acting.  The  Midiclorians turn Star Wars into Star Trek.
Is it worth seeing?  Definitely.  Is it the best movie of all time?  Definitely not.  Does it  live up to all the hype that the media, fans and Lucas poured on us for  months?  How could it?
I cannot understand how people can say they  didn't like this movie.  It has everything a movie needs: Plot, characters,  action, music, suspense. . . Those that say it doesn't have these elements  weren't paying attention. . .
Go see it.  Decide for yourself. . .",951004800,,1591,4.400696864111498
671198,5,6303454038,"For someone who sees very few movies in the theater, and who owns mostly Disney (other than the original SW trilogy) on VHS, holding my breath for this movie was odd.  I do not usually go to the theater simply because I  cannot stand hype;  I avoided hearing too much about this movie beforehand  so that I would not be disappointed, and apparently it worked.  My  complaints about the story itself are minor... I too was irritated by  JarJar, but my 4 year old, who understands the complexities of no plot more  complex than say the Little Mermaid, loved him, and told me to hush in the  theater when I groaned after his 5th idiocy in as many minutes.  And I too  wanted more of Darth Maul, especially fight scenes, however I understand  why this was not so.  Remembering my original reaction, at 7, to Luke's  opening whine, er I mean, line, in New Hope, I can't honestly say that this  movie was worse in dialogue.  I personally didn't become a fan of SW until  I read the books, and I realize now this was because the worlds and  characters simply did not seem real, I saw right through and was distracted  by the cinemetography.  That really cannot be said about this episode.  Although some parts are obviously digitized if you aren't caught up in it,  it is more surreal than unreal.  Because I have the other 3 memorized  <g>, I caught some discrepancies in the story, but not enough to make  it so the story doesn't work.  And although the movie isn't as  ""dark"" as some wanted it to be, artistically this had to be so:  how else would viewers see the tragedy of the boy from prosphesy?  The  story must NOT be dark, except a little foreshadowing, until the prophesy  starts turning.  And as far as the complaints about the mysticism gone once  we learn the force is caused by micro-organisms, I found this to be the  most fascinating element in the movie.  Lucas used an X-file-esque  explanation for that which cannot be explained, and increased the  implications instead of killing them.
For anyone who was a casual watcher  of the SW originals and expected to finally be caught up in the magic by  this film, or anyone who tried too hard to create their own fantasy, I can  see how it would be a let down.  For those who enjoy mythologies, and  understand the complexities involved in making them work, and for those who  enjoy a movie with action and fight scenes with a plot that is not able to  stand alone (it isn't supposed to!), this movie is an excellent one.

Yeah, he is  annoying, but to the younger adiences it's really funny, so they have  something to enjoy about the movie also..It's not JUST supposed to be for  adults, it's for everyone, and in order to do that, Lucas made a new  character to relate to the younger fans...

I enjoyed watching this film with my father, my  son and my daughter.  We all liked it.  I am not going to get all upset  because Jar-Jar was a horrible character.  Sometimes in life, there really  are horrible characters around.  The Death of the two best characters  didn't even upset me.  I won't say who, in case there are a few people left  that don't know the results of the film.  When I spoke to my friends about  the film, we started off by complaining about the bad parts but by the end  of the discussion, we were ready to go and see the movie again.  I could  watch the pod race and the climactic light sabre battle over and over.  This movie may not be the end all of the Star Wars films, but it let us get  a glimpse of the past and introduced us to the characters that will sculpt  the future.  We all want to know: how a young innocent like Anakin will  become the evil and feared Sith Lord - Darth Vader, how will Palpatine make  his domination of the Galaxy a reality, how will C-3PO get off of Tatooine  and get the rest of his skin (not to mention, have his creator seemingly  forget all about him in the future), how will George Lucas get Queen  Amadala into a golden bikini, how will Jar-Jar (hopefully) meet his demise,  where are the Wookies, and will Boba-Fett make an appearance in the next  film.  Well, I would like to see the last one.  I think it is the huge  Star-Wars fans that hate this movie the most, they were unreal in their  expectations.

Anyway, this film is pitiful. Several reviewers below remarked that this is the best Star Wars film because it had the action the other three did not. If half ofthe nation takes Star Wars (the originals) as a very slow action film, I will  shoot myself. SW:PM would be a smash action hit were it released under the  title of ""Super Galaxy Battle Delux"".
The plot is near  non-existent. Here is the plot: taxes are killing planet Naboo. The queen  of the planet takes off to the Galactic Senate to lobby for tax drops. She  travels back and destroys the invading armies. Happy ending  sequence.
Visuals in this film are the best yet. They are dimensional,  atmospheric, and they perfectly portray whatever you are currently  watching. To be exact, they perfectly underline the fact that there is no  substance to this film. Instead of good acting, mysticism, numerous  planets, romance, adventure in otherworldly environs, and some sort of  inspiring lesson, we get:
a) Jar Jar - I believe that he plays the role  of Yoda in this film. He has a similar accent and his role is played for  gags and slapstick jokes. I'm not saying that Yoda was all-humor, but,  agree, how many of us DIDN'T smile at Yoda's incessant backwards talk?
b)  storyline - a brave queen battles taxes!  A worse story could have spewed  from the PowerBook of Hollywood's stupidest hack!
c) insight into the  Star Wars universe - we get lots of names for their stupid devices. No  legends, no tales, just useless factoids. Oh, yes, we learn that the Force  is the collective action of microbes. [cough, cough] I am a Jedi!  [ cough,  cough] Bow down before me!
d) action - well, this is the touchy area  where the Star Wars pseudo-fans went nuts. How about this - the action was  horrid!  The Scarab Droids looked menacing, but I have seen the exactly  same creatures  - guess where - the Dark Crystal!  They look exactly the  same, only here they represent no threat whatsoever!  The Great Final  Battle? That was so off-the-wall!  I believe that some other  characters were more proficient in the use of the Force than Obi Wan, but  even they did not perform such ludicrous feats!  The super-merchandised pod  race? The part when Sebulba crashes is the only fun part, and even that  because of the spectacularity with which the thing explodes!

The directing and pacing were  uneven and showed Lucas' long time away from the chair.  The vaunted  computer special effects looked as if they were computer special effects,  which did nothing to suspend my disbelief.  Lucas' hackneyed use of cliches  have become extremely tiring, as well as his elitism.  And, yes, Jar Jar  was especially annoying.  The only cool thing was the three-way fight scene  but even that cannot pick the movie up from one star.  I guess Jedi Knights  do not bleed after being hit in the gut with a light saber... how  convenient indeed!
Finally, the lack of a DVD release until 2005 just  shows Lucas' contempt for his audience and his worship of money.  This is  one video to avoid.",950832000,13,1043,4.720670391061453

There seem to be a lot of racial stereotypes, even though Lucas has denied this.  And to make  up for it, the next film is going to be more culturally diverse.  There  will be an Asian character who specializes in martial arts.  Good way to  avoid stereotypes.  There are good action scenes in TPM, bu the billions of  special effects actually detract from the film.  Jar-Jar needs to die, yet  it has been confirmed that he will return for the next one.  The first 3  Star Wars films are absolute masterpieces; this one, though enjoyable, most  definitely is not.",950832000,,694,4.483870967741935
671290,4,6303454038,"Back in 1980, I fell in love with Princess Leia and The Empire Strikes Back.  When Return of the Jedi came out in 1983, I was disappointed because my expectations were set too high.  In 1999 I looked forward to The Phantom  Menace with renewed expectation.  Yet in the back of my mind, I feared a  similar let-down to 1983.  That was exactly the case.  My first viewing of  the movie, at midnight of course, was a tremendous let-down.  I didn't  think I even wanted to see the movie again, after seeing the first three  movies at least 20 times each in the theater alone.  Eventually I did see  it again, and the movie got better with each viewing.  I think everyone  agrees that the visual effects are spectacular.  John Williams did yet  another excellent job with the film score.  But even though all of the main  actors are very good actors, they seem to have been limited by the script  and the director in their ability to act in this movie.  Better direction,  even with the same script, would have significantly improved the  movie.(Hopefully, that will not be the case in the next two.)  I'm not  going to harp on how terrible Jar-Jar Binks was, or how stupid the whole  midi-chlorian thing was.  I'm not even going to mention that Anakin was a  character I just didn't care about.  Let's move on to things that were good  about the movie.  Some of the best acting in this movie is left to very  small characters.  Shmi Skywalker, Anakin's mother, is performed  wonderfully.  Samuel L. Jackson, as Mace Windu, did an excellent job with a  limited amount of camera time.  As previously mentioned, the visual and  sound effects were excellent, as was the film score.  The movie keeps a  good pace and has several interesting plot twists, including dual  identities.  The many flaws should not be over-looked, but they should not  over-shadow an otherwise enjoyable movie.  One thing that should be  remembered when viewing a movie is not how good it is compared to some  other movie(because it's not as good as the other three), but how does the  movie stand by itself.  This is an enjoyable movie to sit back and watch,  plain and simple. Does is stray from the original plot from time to time .  . . definitely!  But this is an enjoyable movie experience which should not  be missed because of a few problems.  It's not Shakespeare, and there are  certainly better movies out there, but this is an enjoyable film to watch  with a bucket of popcorn and a large pop!",950832000,,2473,4.560919540229885

At the end of the movie, my 11 friends that I  had rallied around me, stood anxiously at the entrance to the theater.  They were waiting for my reaction and wouldn't make a peep until I'd given  them the go ahead.  ""I have waited 20 some-odd years for THAT.""  Once the floodgate was opened, similar comments poured forth for hours.  This time, we went and shared the latest Star Wars entry over a beer and I  can honestly say that not one person in the group had a positive thing to  say.

Though the  special effects in this movie are mind-blowing, they're not the first of  their kind. And don't believe all of the criticism you hear of Jar-Jar  Binks. He was a great comical relief, and just a basically funny creature  -- you can't help but fall in love; the Queen is a strong and intelligent  young woman -- just the kind you want as a role model for your daughter;  and Anakin is smart and witty, taking in his situation with a wonderful  sense of humor. You meet Obi-Wan before he becomes ""Ben"", and  find where he gets all of his wisdom from in the form of Qui-Gon Jinn.
This has got to be the best Sci-Fi picture ever made since ROTJ. But  when you see it, don't compare it to the original.

But if I buy this movie, and I might just hold out for the slim but wonderous chance that Lucas blesses us with DVD now instead of later,  it will be for the last 10 minutes of footage during the last half hour of  action:  Light saber heaven.  Now don't get me wrong, I don't want any  Anakin accidentally blowing up the control ship, I want the Maulmeister  cleverly dividing and almost completely conquering the dynamic duo of QGJ  and OB1.  I want the so fast you must pause and slow play (DVD please)  light saber strokes.  I want to watch the hours Maul has to kill OB1 as he  rises out of the shaft.  I want to watch it over and over.  Repeat A - B  style (DVD again).  I just wish I COULD edit out the other 2/3 of the final  half hour.  Not that they're that bad, just multiple interruptions of Jedi  bliss.  The first 10 minutes aren't too bad either.  Love that penetrating  saber in portal scene.  Spoiled by rolling droid balls.  By the way, to all  you Jar Jar rippers out there, what about Fode and Beed?  Not nearly as  much screen time, but considerable damage to the Star Wars universe in such  a short time!  If Jar Jar is coming back, which it sounds like he certainly  is, Maul better come back, just to finish him off.
Here is the big  question, if Lucas produced this all himself, to avoid studio tampering,  why did he make a bigger mess than any studio exec. ever could dream?  I  mean the least common demo type script, full of very childish jokes, come  on.  Star Wars was so much more natural in its stupid humor.  So easy and  subtle. (Granted cheesy, but not hit you over the head fart jokes.)  I  couldn't dream of writing up such a successful fantasy universe, so spare  me any retorts, but something happened to the magic, and I know its more  than everyone growing up.

671387,3,6303454038,"I'm one of the ""old-school"" Star Wars fans that had the joy and magic to see the Original in the theater many more years ago then I care to remember. This film was the most hyped-up piece of work because it took my  generation back to a time when we were children and had nothing but our  imaginations driving us day after day. Then we get this film, and it  becomes clear why Lucas was ""afraid"" to write anything after the  end of ""Jedi"". I never understood if a writer is so worried about  messing-up a successful series, why he wouldn't have the guts to give it to  someone who ""does"" have talent in filmmaking instead of us  waiting so long to see his weakness show. Now granted, ILM is the best in  the World and they proved their part once again with their work on this  film, but looks and Special Effects Magic is practically all one can give  to the film. Only a few Actors earned their money, one of which being Ewan  McGregor. But unfortunately I can't be modest on the young Anakin Skywalker  simply because he's a young actor... I think we've all seen actors of the  same age act circles around this one, including Elija Wood and Haley Joel  Osment from ""The Sixth Sense"". - Good young actors are out there  regaurdless of their ""cutness"" and an actor is only as good as  their director... you had the feeling while watching this film that Lucas  didn't make the young actor do as many takes as he should to get it right.  Then of course it goes without saying about Jar Jar Binks... The Character  really didn't look all that bad when we all saw him in the previews but  then we all heard his voice and it made our ears bleed. From the first two  minutes of his appearence, I was hoping he'd take a bullet. - If it hadn't  been for the Superb Fight sequence of Darth Maul, this character would've  single-handedly ruined the entire movie putting it right up there with all  the Sequals and Prequals that have been ignored due to the idea that they  ruined a great series (Can anyone say ""Aliens 3""?) ... I'd have  to say accept this film because the series is not yet over, but don't waste  your money on buying any special edition unless it comes on DVD.

No suspense, no creativity, no mind  boggeling plot twists, no romance, no intersting characters...wait, what's  this at the bottom? A little action and a few pretty pictures, hardly worth  a 20 year wait. The only thing worse than the movie was the constant din of  a small pack of blind Lucas devotees who won't admit that their God has  failed, that he is a flawed human. These are the people that constantly  re-watch the movie hoping that it gets better with each viewing and send  around midless email and postings to try to get others to re-watch to try  to artificaly jack up the domestic box, giving the illusion that George did  a great job.

I saw the original STAR WARS in the theatre almost 50 times and I even enjoyed the cheesy-ness of ROTJ. I feel like STAR WARS was the  biggest influece on my childhood and it holds a special place in my heart.
That being said, Episode 1 was a HUGE disappointment for me. I don't  care what they do with this ""boxed-set"", the movie is still going  to disappoint whether it's DTS, Widescreen, etc.
I didn't expect it to  live up to all the hype, but I didn't expect that the plot and charcters  would be as one-dimensional as a Power Rangers episode. I am well aware of  the flaws of the first three movies. But Epsiode 1 lacked all the charm,  enthusiasm, characters, and emotion of the first three. Yes, the CGI,  Podrace, and light sabre duel were great, but THAT'S IT. Darth Maul could  have been an icredible villian had he been given half a chance. What a  waste of great actors and some of the best talent ever assembled on a  movie.

From start to finish, I was  completely caught up in another world.  Lucas's masterpiece has the ability  to sweep you away for two hours and take you on an exciting journey like no  other film has.  This movie is a throwback to ""old-time""  entertainment that is ""good vs. evil"" and exciting and FAMILY  ORIENTED.
I do not consider myself a huge Star Wars fan, but I absolutely  loved this film.  Avoid the opinions of all the Star Wars nuts who would  not have been satisfied if Lucas had shot a four hour epic on LOCATION in a  galaxy far away with real Jedi.
The story is great (and emotional when  you realize what the future holds for some of the characters), special  effects are astounding, and characters are cool.  What else do you want?

I liked him too, but I  don't think the movie sucks because I personally would have liked to see  more of him!  He was supposed to be a menacing background character (hence:  The Phantom Menace), not a new Darth Vader.

I am a Star Wars fan and have been since I  saw the first one on its debut night back in '77. I was 7 years old. That  movie and its sequels were magic to me. They taught virtue and allowed the  audience to care about the characters and their situation. This latest  installment had nothing to offer except wonderful visuals by the ILM team  and a great but anit-climatic duel.(why didn't Maul just slice Obi-wan on  his Pete Pan-esque leap?) The story lost its sense of mysticism as well.  Did we really need to know that the Jedi have micro-organisms in them that  help them commune with the Force? NO! That debased the whole premise of the  mystic and religious overtones of the originals. It didn't matter that Luke  probably had a higher midichlorian count than Ben did. We didn't need the  explanation! That would be like saying Jesus had a mojo-bag so he could  hear God. What a shame and a sham.
George, please, we can forget this if  you do another Episode I that has a meaningful plot and characters with  depth(other than 3D, Maya-generated characters), or at least end(kill)  Jar-Jar in the next movie.

The first three movies were lauded so heavily, hat Lucas  simply could not live up to public expectations, and he most certainly  doesn't.  The story of the phantom menace is contrived, slow and altogether  a departure from earlier sar wars movies.  The phantom menace is essenially  a 2 hour advertisemen for the toys.  A particularly drawn out scene is the  pod-race, in which a predictable ending is streched through many minutes  void of dialog or characterization.  The characters themselves in the  phantom menace were shallow and under-developed.  (don't even get me  started on jar jar binks)  any actual emotion seemed a tacked on sub-plot.  Other things I didn't like was the medicalization of the force, and the coy  allusion to some immaculate conception of anakin.  Both of these facets are  only touched upon, leaving the viewer bewildered as to their deeper  significance.  I enjoyed the action at the end, but it was too litle  too late.  I was already bored from the bad acing and melodramaic script.  i don't know what convinced Lucas that he could still write and direct.  (lucas did not write or direct Empire or Jedi, but was an executive  producer)  I am a long time star wars fan, and I had waited a lifetime to  see this movie, and I am sorry that it dissapointed me and others.

If you have not, but have seen the originals, then I have these words for you: It's just not the same. Between the making of Jedi and  Phantom Menace, Lucas lost something (I personally think it's his mind). He  just isn't as good a story teller. The places we visit in the film (Naboo,  Tatooine, and Coruscant) are simply not as richly described by elements of  the film as they are in the first three films. Lucas basically leaves it to  a few wide shots to show us what Coruscant is like, and obviously uses our  knowledge about Tatooine from the original films as a crutch, an excuse not  to explore the desert planet more fully in this one. Naboo is explored, but  the annoyance factor of Jar Jar Binks keeps the enjoyment of even those  scenes which really could have made the movie great at a low level.

Very disturbing parallels between world events and events in the movie. There is clearly a much deeper level to the movie than what most 12-year-olds will notice.

Most noteworthy, the movie came out a month after the Columbine High School massacre, which was only a few miles from my home. The movie, as well as the killings, made me reflect on how a cute little boy could possibly mutate into a ruthless killer.

It is clear to me that George Lucas deliberately set out to create a movie that was a little sillier and more frivolous than the earlier three. The contrast between Phantom Menace and Episode III (where, no doubt, lots of good people are going to die) should be very striking. Then, I think, people will understand Phantom Menace much better.

Liam Neeson is a great actor but as  Qui-Jon Jinn, I saw only a two-dimensional actor. I suppose I am a little  prejudice; the regal status of Alec Guiness is a tough act to follow. I  give the movie 3 stars because of the action and special effects.  Lucasfilms does their usual excellent job appealing to the visual and audio  senses. The fight scene with Darth Maul, Qui-Gon Jinn and a young Obi-Wan  Kenobi is classic. I wish Darth Maul was used more in this movie because he  was awesome. Many people believe that Star Wars is about Luke Skywalker  saving the galaxy, but it is really about a savior created by the Force  (immaculate conception), Anakin Skywalker (played by young actor Jake  Lloyd). Looking at innocent Anakin, one could not help but wonder how such  a boy could become the evil villian Darth Vader. But young Lloyd earned his  pay by portraying his character in grand fashion. The movie would have been  better if Jar-Jar Binks, some type of amphibian idiot, was left out. Think  of Binks as Hong-Kong Phooey with gills using Ebonics. The Phantom Menace  lives up to the original with numerous aliens, including a young Jabba the  Hutt, but Lucas kind of overloads you with them. We get to see the home  world of the Jedi Council, Coruscant. Coruscant is a world where every inch  is covered with technology; visually stunning. And that's just it, the  entire movie is visually fascinating but lacks in what previous Star Wars  movies had, character interaction.

To those who watched the first trilogy simply for the flashing  lights and pretty colors this movie won't make any sense at all.  But for  those who understood the mythical underpinnings of the saga this movie made  perfect sense.
This is where everything starts.  It shows the Old  Republic,  the Galactic Senate,  and the initial conception of the Evil  Galactic Empire.  But beyond all of that this installment shows us a true  Jedi Master in his own element - and what he is capable of.
This is the  beginning.  The first chapter.  From here things will descend into oblivion  over the course of the next two episodes leading up to that Star Destroyer  chasing Princess Leia's Tantive IV Blockade Runner over the surface of  Tatooine.
Complaining about the lack of a ""Han Solo"" character  is simply idiotic.  To have one would be redundant.  The story already has  a ""Han Solo"" character.  He enters the story in Chapter  IV.

Information regarding the Jedi Council,  the training of a Jedi,  how the Empire came to be,  what Luke and Leia's  mother was like,  and above all the origin of Anakin Skywalker,  his  importance to the galaxy,  and why the character of Darth Vader is a tragic  figure.
Earlier complaints about the movie being ""dumbed down""  are completely inaccurate.  It is in fact the other way around,  and  low-brows are complaining because Lucas is forcing them to connect the dots  themselves.  And Jar Jar was put there specifically so the kids would have  something to latch onto,  because the grandeur of the story would no doubt  airplane the younger ones.
Basically if you don't get it,  you just don't  get it,  and nothing anyone can say will change that.  And if you do get  it,  then you already know this movie was a milestone and you already know  everything I have been saying.

It was nice to see the Star Wars opening theme again after all these years, and there are cameo appearances throughout the  film by characters such as the Jabba the Hutt, Yoda, etc.  The soon-to-be  emporer is present, is a well-acted and marvellously scheming  character.
But the main problem with this film is that the aliens are on  the level of cartoon characters.  Some people found the Ewoks silly, but  they're far more believable than the 'Muppet Show 1999' on display here.  And the 'big fish eaten by bigger fish eaten by still bigger fish' sequence  is straight out of a comic strip.
Another problem is the fact that this  film is so obviously based around commercialism.  The hundreds of different  kinds of aliens are present to sell toys, the pod race is there to sell a  video game.  In fact a lot of this film felt like watching somebody playing  a video game.  The actors play second fiddle to CGI effects, are hardly  ever given the chance to show any real character.  Darth Maul is  well-designed and looks impressive, but is just wasted in a minor  role.

Watch it once and you  miss a lot because things move so fast.  Watch it for a second or third  time and you begin to love it.  Despite the lack of character development  of Qui-Gon and Obi Wan, it definetely lives up to the Star Wars name.  The  only reason I give this movie 3-stars instead of 4 or 5 is because of  Anakin.  Put in a kid as the focus of a movie and you usually end up  disappointed by their lack of acting skills.  Episode II should prove much  better - the kid is grown up and you can focus more on the Dark Side.  Just  please don't ruin part II by casting Leonardo DiCaprio.",950313600,,938,4.010869565217392

As a fan of Star Wars, I marvel at how George Lucas' vision is translated in an art form.  Mr. Lucas has  created something very special in this film in that he was able to use his  very creative imagination to his fullest.  Yes, I will agree that the  dialogue in the movie can be sketchy at times, but it didn't bother me in  The Phantom Menace.  I do like good writing in films, but Mr. Lucas writes  what he wants to with the story or stories, HE creates.  The action  sequences are memorable, especially with Darth Maul and the two Jedi and  John Williams' electrifying music to go along with it.  No matter how bad  most people think it is, it should be nominated for some Academy Awards.  I'm thinking:  Visual Effects, Costume Design, Makeup, Sound, Sound Effects  Editing, and Art Direction.  The expectations were way too high for most  people and I for one looked at it as a different movie with different  characters and different stories.  Star Wars: Episode I-The Phantom Menace  will be hailed as a technological breakthrough and a continuing tradition  through Industrial Light & Magic, which is primarily responsible for  most of the special effects in movies today.  Companies have spun off from  ILM with its influence.  I just love the movie and anticipate it on DVD in  the coming years.",950313600,,1427,4.622489959839357

671620,3,6303454038,"For the beginning of a saga that is already rich in fairy-tale and fantasy tropes, The Phantom Menace lacks the density it needs.  Even for the beginning of a prequel trilogy that may be fairly self-contained, this  first of the three is surprisingly weak.  Biological explanations of the  Force are not enough--we need to know about the relationship between the  Sith and Jedi now.  The fact that the first film largely ignores such  interesting material leaves me wary of the next two films (even though  they'll be darker and probably more interesting), because they will now  have to take up the issues that Phantom ignored.  I do admire Lucas's  attempt to create a political fantasy, but despite all the talk in the  original trilogy about governors and senators, the Star Wars saga is not as  political as Lucas seems to want it to be.  Even Return of the Jedi  surpasses Phantom in that Lucas kept himself honed in on the fantasy--the  emotional struggle, even the high dramatics were far more interesting in  that weakest film of the first trilogy.  Now, we have Phantom, which is,  surprisingly, even simpler than A New Hope.  With all the richness already  set up in the first trilogy, it pained me to see that Lucas ignored it.  Phantom is a decent action film with incredibly realized fantastic worlds.  And that is about it.",950313600,,1338,4.771929824561403

There also were some cheesey lines in the movie.  Such as the line anakin says to his mother about helping people in the  galaxy.

Everytime I saw it, it seemed to get better and better, but there are still a few things a huge fan like myself would love to ask George. Things such as why didn't Maul have a bigger  role. I read so much hype about how he was the new evil,(Maul's character  was as dark and cool as I thought he'd be), but he really wasn't givin a  chance show us what he could really do until the end.  The scenes he was  in, were fantastic, but he seemed to appear then disappear, literaly!  I  just think that if he had more scenes, it would have made the movie  a-little more satisfying for us action-adrenaline freaks!  Hopefully, the  sith lord in the second movie won't suffer the same  fate.(George..hint,hint,hint! )
Second is Jar Jar....the more times I  watched TPM the more he grew on me. BUT!  I think he has definately run  his course...Anything more than a bit part in Episode II would be a big  mistake.
Another quam is the dogfight between the Naboo starfighters and  the Droid fighters around the  control ship.  There was so much potential  which couldn't be brought to fruition in the five ten-second scenes we saw  of the battle.  The space battle scene in Jedi is what helped make that  movie great.

I  especially liked the way the design of the movie implied that the republic  was at one time the pinnacle of galactic achievement; the architecture,  spacecraft, fashion, etc.  The later years (witnessed in A New Hope, The  Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi) show decay and the breakdown  of the organized consumer base.

Everyone else are just rabble awaiting the pleasure of  their betters.
But enough philosophical differences.

If certain aspects had to be shortened such as the detailed character development of the key players, than so be it.  The next  movies will do that.  Episode 1 sets up the situation and shows us who is  who in the star wars universe.  It is true that this film is more about the  situation than the characters, but that's the way it's supposed to be.  The  first chapter always does that.  Lucas hasn't lost his ability, he knows  exactly what he's doing with the story.  The film has also been criticized  for being too kid friendly, even though it is on the same level as the  other 3.  The story is more in depth in this film, with the political  situation, the duality of palpatine.  This film has it all.  It is a great  mythological story that plants the seeds for the following chapters to  flourish.  The CG effects are unsurpassed and even the hated jar-jar binks  brings a kind of slapstick humor that was missing from the classic films.  The explanation of the midichlorians makes sense also.  They don't secrete  the force, the more of them you have in you, the stronger connection you  have with the force.  That makes perfect sense!

All I cared about was the fact that I was magically  taken away to a world that let my imagination soar.  We mimicked the  characters and reenacted the movies story over and over for most of our  childhood. When Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi appeared they  refueled this wonderful universe for me and my brothers play in. Now that I  am ""grown up"" I get to see my nephews and daughters enjoy this  magical world that had once captured me as a child. Episode 1 is  incredible, beautiful and captivating.  This movie was everything that I  had expected and more. I am very thankful that George Lucas created this  magical world for the next generation to enjoy.

671978,4,6303454038,"As I strolled through the Regency 20 theaters on May 22, 1999,(with a jumbo pack of Twizzlers and large Sprite, my standard movie going fare) my anticipation was high. My imagination was filled with child-like delight.  My eyes twinkled like the prom queen's...ok, maybe that's more than you  NEED to know, but nevertheless, I was positively enthralled with the chance  to view before my very eyes, Star Wars: Episode 1-The Phantom Menace. The  movie was, without a doubt, the most hyped and anticipated presentation in  cinematic history, prompting people to even wildly erupt in thunderous  applause when the 2 minute TRAILER was shown months earlier(I even heard  one person exclaim ""REWIND IT! "")....But how would it stand to  the discriminating critique of Joe Lunchpail and Sally Housecoat? Judging  from the word on the street, you'd think this movie was more disappointing  than ""Showgirls"". But the box office receipts say  otherwise...Personally, I LOVED the movie, but then again, I'm ALSO  inpressed by the savagery of vultures fighting over a raccoon carcass. The  movie was nothing more than an introduction to the storylines to follow.  No, you will not find any gripping and compelling dialogue, although I do  admit to being a little choked up when young Anakin(played so Culkin-like  by Jake Lloyd) has to leave his mother. Like many a movie, it is eye candy  du-jour, with it's lush vegetation, desert landscapes, and your standard  dogfights in space. And THAT is why this movie is fun to watch. You even  get to see the Jedi's preference of corpse disposal towards the end of the  movie. It has it ALL....While I'm sure that Episodes 2 & 3 will be more  spellbinding and satisfying to those who prefer more Shakespere and less  shooting, this movie is more pleasing to the eye. We will see more bonding  between Obi-Wan(Ewan McGregor), and Anakin(which I pray to GOD will not be  played at any point and time by Leonardo DiCaprio), and hopefully we'll see  more of Mace Windu(Samuel L. Jackson, 'cause even in SPACE, there's gotta  be a brotha' throwin' it DOWN on the bad guys! )...But this movie is  DEFINITELY worth your while, even if to just hear the entrancing and  soothing sounds of a swinging lightsaber....",949968000,17,2237,4.940860215053763

I expected a movie which did not encapsulate the mood and  feeling of the previous Lucas masterpieces. Not only did it exceed these  expectations but it went one stage further, it had the force.

672076,5,6303454038,Star Wars Episode I was fantastic. I saw it in the theaters and I loved it. My favorite part was the pod racing. 10 minutes of the greatest racing I ever saw. Unbelievable!,949881600,,172,4.242424242424242
672077,5,6303454038,"Everybody seems to want to comment on why this one didn't seem to live up to the original, so I'll add my .02 rather quickly. The Empire Strikes Back in many ways defined the original trilogy, and was a cinimatic masterpiece.  This trilogy isn't to that point yet. So no, The Phantom Menace is not on  the same footing as the first trilogy. But it's only one movie at this  point. It's a first-rate entertainment that simply hasn't entered the area  of legend yet :)
And it's certainly high-quality entertainment. The pod  race was dramatic, but even it didn't thrill me nearly to the extent that  the climactic lightsabre duel at the end did. That was incredible, almost  too much for one film. Palpatine and Maul have a menace, although one  entirely different to what Vader presents in the earlier (later?) films.  While most of the characters don't develop a lot within the course of this  film, each of the major characters do have defining moments which are  well-written and acted. The film has all the elements we know and love.  Plus, the average quality of the acting is much better than Star Wars at  least. Liam Neeson provides a strength of character and while nobody is in  even the same ballpark as Alec Guinness or Peter Cushing, none of the  dialog is as painful as some of that stuff from Star Wars.
Still, the  film is subtly different in character from Star Wars. The bad guys are more  subtle, the good guys less emphatic. The (Phantom) menace is much more  ephemeral, and as such the dark-vs.-light theme is less classical. And,  most crucially, this is obviously film one of three. It's a setup. And as  such, it's in some sense a tremendous cliffhanger. So many questions about  the growth of the Jedi's understanding of the Force, Anakin's fate, and the  nature of the Sith are raised and left unanswered that you can't help but  yearn for Episode II, which has the potential to be every bit as epic as  the Empire Strikes Back. That will be the acid test of whether the Phantom  Menace, like Star Wars itslef, is ""just"" first-rate entertainment  or whether it provide a mythology for a new generation.",949881600,,2127,4.6353887399463805
672078,2,6303454038,"I'll be brief: this movie had no acting, plot, romance or humor. Special effects alone are not enough to make a movie interesting, especially a film with as much potential as Star Wars.
As the initial installment in the  series, this movie could have done a MUCH better job of introducting the  main characters. I still think a real prologue to the series is necessary,  that details the reasons WHY Palpatine moves to the Dark Side and a good  story behind Anakin's mother.
The plot was very weak: the conflict  between Naboo and the Federation was obviously contrived and was only of  marginal importance to the real issues of Anakin's early days and  Palpatine's move for power.
Many people have said that all of the Star  Wars movies are really kids' movies, and that Jar Jar was consistent with  episodes IV, V and VI. If so, why does this CG anamoly come across as  excessive juvenile and irrelevant to the plot?
Lucas should hire a new  director and some real writers to help with Episode II. It's a shame to mar  the spectacular story of the first three films.",949881600,14,1068,4.592592592592593
672079,3,6303454038,"In writing this review i will compare The Phantom Menace to the other Star Wars movies. First off the sound. The music in the Phantom Menace is mostly disapointing, besides the excellent 'Duel of Fates' the music is either  repeated or not very good. 'The Imperial March' from Empire is far better  than 'Duel of Fates'. In terms of story The Phantom Menace is fairly  adequate, the plot is very difficult to detect and some people may think  that it doesn't have one. In terms of set pieces i think that The Phantom  Menace has only two real exciting moments, the lightsaber duel in the  reactor core and the deployment of the droids onto the battlefield. These  set pieces are both mediocre when compared to: the battle of Hoth, the  asteroid chase, the duel on Cloud City, The first attack run, the second  attack run, the space battle in Jedi and the speeder bike chase. I really  didn't like the podrace. Now, here comes the big surprise, Even the effects  aren't as good. I may sound mad but the models and puppets they used for  the classic trilogy are for more realistic than The Phantom Menace's CGI  effects. Overall The Phantom Menace comes third in the Star Wars quadology,  lagging behind the exciting and deep Empire, the exciting and not so deep  Jedi but still ahead of the not so exciting and not so deep A New Hope.",949881600,4,1333,4.542016806722689

672170,3,6303454038,"This movie is like all the rest that come out every year--great special effects, horrible plot and character development.

So if you are able to entertain yourself with  nothing more than dazzling special effects and think that good character  development only muddles up a film, then you'll probably enjoy this.  Otherwise you'll see it for the tasteless hype that it is.",949881600,5,578,4.797979797979798
672171,1,6303454038,"I was and am a huuuuuuge fan of the original trilogy.  They were great intelligent films, with adult themes that kids could enjoy because of cool action and neat special effects.  They had a grand and epic story of the  ages.  Episode one is really just a kids movie that some adults might think  contains some neat special effects -- but little else.  I could hardly  beleive that after waiting umpteen years for epsisode 1 that I would be  looking at my watch and wondering when it would be over.  It just could not  hold my attention because the script read like a Saturday morning GIJoe or  Transformers or Thundercats cartoon of old.  Simple, ridiculous story that  makes no sense except for kids to learn that good beats evil with  action-figure-like power.  Unlike the original trilogy, the action was not  clever and was completely unbeleiveable.  The heros win the day because Jar  Jar trips on a pile of blue balls, accidentily releasing them into the  ranks of the enemy troop. Next, the little boy Anakin hides in a spaceship,  hits the auto-pilot (keep in mind the experienced pilots can hardly even  get their ships out of the hanger let alone hold up in battle), and viola!  he lands right in the middle of the control ship (there are about 50 of  them, but he just happens to fly into the right one) and shoots a few times  and the entire enemy fleet is destroyed. How conveinent.  Maybe some  techincal trekkies will argue that Anakin has the ""force"" and can  do anything, but the lame plot device of invoking the force when the  writers cannot think of a clever action sequence is no substitute for the  clever action that should have been.  I won't even talk about Jar Jar or  how lame the overall character development was,  I'll leave that to you  guys.

672175,5,6303454038,"The newest installment in the Star Wars saga takes us back about 25-30 years before the original movie made in 1977.  Instead of having the usual cast of characters (Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and  Chewbacca)there are new characters and characters from the original.  The  characters from the original are younger.  Among them are Obi-Wan Kenobi,  Anakin Skywalker, C-3PO and R2-D2.  The new characters are Qui-Gon Jin, Jar  Jar Binks, and Darth Maul.  The movie is good.  All the originals are  better though.  The new lacks the intellectual aspect of the originals.  The comic releif in the originals are R2-D2 and C-3PO.  Instead of just  acting stupid, they were interpreters.  They had a reason to be inthe  movie.  Jar Jar Binks is just a stupid little ""Gungan"" who just  talks incoherently and makes no sense.  The good thing about was the back  story.  This movie tells about the time before Luke and Leia are born.  Even though it lacks the same feeling as the originals, that feeling is  filled in by the young Obi-Wan Kenobi.  He gives off a good vibe and keeps  you hooked.  Being a huge Star Wars fan myself, I appreciated this movie  and loved it.  But for movie fans who could care less that this movie came  out, it is lousey.  So, in conclusion, my star rating is for Star Wars  fans.  For Movie fans, I give it a 2 out of 5.

672176,4,6303454038,"First of all there was no way this film could have lived up to its pre-release hype. The original trilogy has attained legendary status,much like The Godfather I and II.Just as Godfather III suffered in comparison to  its predecessors because of raised expectations,so does Phantom  Menace. People just expect a perfect film after waiting so long for the  release of a film that carries the Star Wars name. In my opinion,this film  is better than Return of the Jedi and does not pale in comparison to  Episode IV.It is not as good as Empire Strikes Back,but hey few films  are. The thing I really liked about Phantom Menace was the fight  sequences. George Lucas said that he wanted to show the audience what a Jedi  in his prime would be like in battle. I thought he did a remarkable job of  this. The choreography of the fight scenes were much better in this film  than the other Star Wars films. I believe that the decision to cast a  martial artist as Darth Maul contributed to this. Since Darth Maul was not  written as a mastermind type of villain,he was more of a henchman,I thought  it was a good idea to have someone who is adept at the martial arts play  him rather than an accomplished actor. After all the only reason Darth Maul  was in the film was as an imposing physical threat. I think those who  complain that this character is not developed enough are missing the  point. I personally was able to tolerate Jar Jar ,and did not believe as so  many others did,that he detracted from the film enough to ruin it. Even  those who did not like the plot of the film or the acting must admit that  the special effects were dazzling. The pod race,the battle droids,and the  underwater scenes are just some of the examples of the great  effects. Overall I would recommend this film to anyone who likes the sci-fi  genre. So much for my review of the film. Now I want to talk about the  decision not to release this film on DVD.One of the main reasons I bought a  DVD player was for effects heavy films like Phantom Menace,The Matrix,and  The Mummy. I believe you get more out of films like these on DVD than you do  on VHS.I waited for Phantom Menace to be released on DVD with a lot of  anticipation,eagerly awaiting to see and hear the advantages a film like  this can have on DVD as opposed to VHS.I would have been glad to shell out  the extra money for the DVD.I am not a DVD snob,I still rent and buy  VHS,however I'll tell you this I have no plans to let myself be exploited  by this scheme hatched to make people buy this film twice. I will not buy  the VHS version,and as much as I liked this film,I may not buy the DVD  whenever it comes out. This film was released in theaters nearly a year  ago. Is Lucas trying to tell us that they did not have enough time to  release a quality DVD?There did not seem to be a problem releasing The  Matrix DVD,and it was released the same year as the film. I sincerely hope I  don't have to wait twenty years to own Episodes I,II,and III on DVD.The  loyal fans of the Star Wars films have kept the interest in these films  alive for over twenty years,enabling a series of prequels to be made in the  first place. We deserve better treatment.",949795200,,3196,4.349152542372881
672177,5,6303454038,"I am an average SW fan. Not a fanatic. But I did love the originals. I think people remember the original trilogy when they were like 12 and so nobody minded all the unrealistic and childish elements then. As kids, Star  Wars was flawless. The scene in ""Empire Strikes Back"" still irks  me, where they land inside a giant worm's stomach and of course, there is  air pressure and gravity just like on Earth, even though they are in an  asteroid! Nobody even checks to see if its safe to leave the ship.
Episode I was superior in many aspects. NOTHING in the old trilogy is  anywhere near as visually stunning as Naboo and Corusant. Those two things  alone make the movie worth watching. The costumes, and the ships are much  sleeker and more believable than the originals ever were. The light saber  duel was ten times more exciting than anything in the first trio. Even John  Williams' score ""Duel of the Fates"" is unforgettable and far  beyond any of the original music. As for Jar Jar being annoying, yes, he  was annoying, but that didn't bother me a bit! Because he was PLAYING an  annoying character! He was SUPPOSED to be annoying. He annoyed Obi and  Qui-Gon too. That was part of the necessary comic relief to play as a foil  to the stoic Jedi.
As for the Jedi acting stiff, well of course they  were, THEY ARE JEDI! Jedi aren't supposed to be emotional. And still I  really felt for Qui-Gon in the end. Anakin I must admit didn't act all too  well. But what really irks me about TPM are the small things. The robot  going; ""Roger Roger"" made me want to scream; ""IS THIS  SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS?"" And what I hated most, the way most people  felt about Jar Jar, is how I felt about that dumb two headed announcer. I  mean he looked so cartoonish, and he sounded just like Howard Cosell! That  was simply too much of a stretch of the imagination. But the plot, in my  mind, was superb. Those who didn't like it didn't understand it maybe. It  was rather deeper than the others. Basically it involved a corrupt Galactic  Senator trying to get himself elected to a higher position by creating a  Trade Dispute with a foreign planet, putting himself as the person who  would ""save the day"" when in actuality he is the cause of the  dispute. You could even argue that after Episode 1 the bad guys actually  won.
As for buying this VHS, I really think we should all unite as Star  Wars fans and send a clear message to Lucas that; ""We are not going to  fall for these stupid business tactics! We know the only reason you won't  release TPM on DVD is because you KNOW we will buy the VHS and the  DVD."" Let's not allow him to manipulate us this way, his faithful  consumers.

672298,3,6303454038,One thing you have to understand is that George Lucas when interviewed  years ago about the prequels said that they would be very different from  the original episodes IV-VI.  He said the plots would be far less action  oriented and have more political intrigue.  He thought a lot of fans would  not like them expecting something similar to the original trilogy.  From  the reviews so far he has been correct.  He recently described the  prequels like this.  Episode I introduce characters.  Episode II  Anakin  falls in love and marries.  Episode III  Anakin is seduced to the dark side  of the force.  If Episode I was supposed to introduce the characters then  it accomplished its goal.  The trade dispute plot doesn't engage you like  the galactic civil war in the original trilogy but the menace of the Sith  does have a sense of foreboding to it.  In some ways this might have been a  better movie with less special effects and more intrigue but I guess Lucas  felt he couldn't do that to the fans.  A better sense of the political  conflict might have helped.  You do have to view this as a section of a  much larger whole which will be completed  about 6 years from now.  Standing alone it comes up a bit short.,949708800,,1219,4.530232558139535

I think what people don't understand  is that is Chapter 1 of a 6-part story, and that things that weren't quite  explained here will be in the next 2 movies. It's like reading the first  chapter in a book and already knowing the last 3 chapters. And I WAS a kid  (only 3!) when SW premiered in 1977, who am I to complain about the kid  angle now?  I love the new definitions of the Force, and watching how  Palpatine clawed his way into power.  And Jar Jar Binks?  Give him a break!  He was sweet, and he DID have a point!  A very important point, I might  add.  Some people should remember that that this kind of negativity is just  as damaging to kids as too much violence in movies.

Yet after seeing it I'm surprised how close to the truth they were than those who were positive about the film. It is certainly not as bad as  those negative reviewers would have you believe, but it's a major  disappointment, devoid of the life, energy and personality that that made  the original trilogy so good. Non of the characters are as likeable, as  well developed as Luke, Leia and Han. Instead they are flat and  unconvincing. Neeson is miscast as Qui Gon Gin, while McGregor speaks like  a public school toff. The plot has non-of the drive of the original. Lucas  had always maintained that the first film would be to introduce the plot  and characters, yet how come A New Hope managed to do the same, but with  more excitement and action? Here, for the most part, we have a dull  political drama. I didn't really care whether Natalie Portman was going to  sign a treaty with the boring Trade Federation. The action too, suffers a  great deal due to Lucas' handling of the over-flowing plot. The Pod Race is  the only decent action sequence in the film, while the rest never really  get going. The final attack on the Trade Federation ships are barely a  shadow compared to the Death Star assault in A New Hope. The lack of  characterization too makes the final lightsaber duel between Darth Maul  (who in reality gets about 5 minutes of screen time) and Kenobi and Gin,  rather unexciting, because we have no-one to really cheer for like we did  in the original trilogy. In the original trilogy too, Lucas had always kept  a tight reign on the mysticism so it was believable and not overly  pretentious. Here Lucas injects the embarrassing concept of Anakin (a good  performance from the young Lloyd) being the result of a virgin birth.  Please! The special effects are probably the best thing it, yet they too  are strangely hollow, with some of the scenes having that unmistakable  digital ""sheen"" to them, which makes them less than convincing. On the  whole, this is not a total disaster, but not a great achievement either. It  certainly hasn't put me off Star Wars for good and there is much to suggest  that The Phantom Menace will look much better when Episode Two comes out.",949708800,,2277,4.639097744360902
672302,3,6303454038,"I love ""Star Wars"" and consider ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as one of the greatest movies ever made (which Lucas didn't direct or write the screenplay for, hint, hint), but this film really  doesn't cut it when compared to the original trilogy.
The kid playing  Anakin couldn't act if his life depended on it, the digitalized character  Jar Jar Binks belongs on a Saturday morning cartoon show instead of a  ""Star Wars"" film, the villain (Darth Maul) is utterly  one-dimensional, the script is not only dull but poorly written, a  sarcastic Han Solo type is missing, need I go on?
I stood in line for 2  hours to so I could see this movie on opening week (I was simply in denial  about the bad reviews).  I won't make that mistake when ""Episode  II"" is released, which, optimist that I am, I would like to believe  will be superior to this film, which must have been shot as a first draft  script. But Lucas will be writing and directing that one as well, so let's  keep our fingers crossed.
Still, everyone should see the film at least  once-the special effects are nothing short of awe-inspiring.  Ewan McGregor  sounds so much like Alec Guiness that it is truly eerie. The pod race and  the final lightsaber battle are good scenes. As usual, John Williams turns  in a terrific musical score. Were it not for those elements, this film  would have gotten 2 stars only, if not one. As a ""Star Wars"" fan,  I had intended to buy the film, regardless of all of the problems, but will  not buy it on VHS.Lucas refuses to take advantage of the DVD technology and  release any of the ""Star Wars"" films on DVD until after  ""Episode III"" is released. I'll wait. What's the point of buying  the same film twice?",949708800,,1700,4.480392156862745

While i thought he was amusing at times for the most part we was quite a bad adition to the film. The plot  was great and continued in George Lucas' story line quite well, though  personally i liked episode 4, special edition the best of all the available  starwars movies. But then what good would a full set of wide screen and cut  starwars movies be without at least 1 copy of episode 1. So sufice it to  say i will be  getting 2 copies when it comes out. One for me and one for  my sister. I know you'll enjoy this flick and as i am a true star wars fan  i would have givin it 5 stars were it not for Jar Jar. Well anyway George  Lucas' company Industrial Light and Magic (known best for Jurasic Park,  among others) did a supurb job with the special effects in this movie.

When The Phantom Menace premiered in my city, I stood in line for 6 hours  to watch the midnight showing. When reading the opening scroll I knew I had  been hoodwinked. This is one of the worst films ever made. It's Plan 9 from  Outer Space with a 150 million dollar budget. I can't believe George Lucas  had over 20 years to conceive this story and this is the best he could come  up with. Willow and Howard the Duck sound like Shakespeare compared to the  unbelievable stupidity of the dialog for The Phantom Menace. The special  effects are amazing but what big budget movie doesn't have amazing effects  nowadays?

672307,4,6303454038,"I think a lot of the disappointment of those who did not like this movie comes from the fact that this film did not quite inspire the wonder and magic that the first films did.  But, then, this film had some pretty high  standards to meet!
For my part, I just popped some popcorn and went along  for the ride.  There's no doubt that the special effects are the real stars  in this movie; the level of detail in world creation is completely  immersive and very impressive.  The breakneck pace of the pod race sequence  is enough to leave you gasping.  And the furious, dazzlingly-choreographed  lightsaber battles themselves are worth the price of admission.
The  acting is merely adequate, with a wooden Liam Neeson being a little  disappointing and a spunky yet regal Natalie Portman the true gem of the  lot.  Ray Park's Darth Maul provided enough menace to make you want to see  him squirming on the end of a lightsaber, but it won't be enough for those  longing for a villain on par with Darth Vader.  One disappointment is the  technical and biological explanation of the Force, which takes away some of  the spiritual mystique developed in the first three films.  But that is a  minor quibble.
Overall, I think it's most important to remember that this  film is supposed to lay the groundwork for not only two more movies of a  prequel trilogy, but an entire sequence of six films.  If you check your  brain at the door and enjoy the eye candy, it's hard to be disappointed.  Plot and character depth is not to be found in large quantities here, but  it is a welcome opportunity to re-visit the Star Wars universe.",949622400,6,1620,4.573426573426573
672449,1,6303454038,"Lucas has become the ultimate technobrat.  He seems so preoccupied with the technicalities of his digital realm that he seems to have dispensed with other key elements such as story, dialogue and acting performances.  This seat-numbing experience only kicks into a higher gear once (the  pod-race sequence).  Other scenes are dull, lifeless and (in many  instances) downright boring.  A single good performance from a key actor  might have saved this mess but all the actors can do is look embarrassed  and confused (hardly surprising since they had very little to react to when  the film was shot).  The villains are all surprisingly un-menacing (this  kind of movie, like a good James Bond thriller, needs a really good,  hissable villian).  The only thing left to look at is the effects but they  cannot keep this sad, lazy effort afloat.
Lucas has proudly announced  that he is planning to shoot the next installment digitally.  Honestly, who  cares?  Why doesn't he deal with all these technicalities that he obviously  so dearly loves and hand the reigns over to someone else for the episode  II?  Irvin Kershner brought a marvellous sweeping operatic grandeur to  ""The Empire Strike Back"", something Star Wars was in dire need of  in Episodes VI and I.

672456,4,6303454038,"I think the reason The Phantom Menace has gotten some bad press has everything to due with unrealistic expectations and nothing to do with what is an excellent movie.  Too many people went looking for the thrill of the  original movie and when they didn't get that magical moment I think they  were a little turned off.  My point would be that the original movies were  just that the originals.  They came out of nowhere and delivered before our  eyes something we had never seen before.  Since these new movies are built  off of what has already been done how can we really expect something with  the same power?
I for one thoroughly enjoyed the movie and actually went  back to see it in the theater twice more.  It moved along relatively  quickly with only the middle portion of the movie stalling slightly.  Special effects where tremendous with the creations of Naboo and Coruscant  an absolutely breathtaking visual feat.
I had some problems with Darth  Maul in that he never really semmed very ""Evil"" no strangling of  people in a vaderesque manner but I suppose as some other reviewers have  indicated this could have been intentional so as not to distract viewers  from the hidden threat that has not yet fully revealed itself.
Jar Jar  Binks was pretty annoying the first time but I found that each time I saw  the film I found him a bit more acceptable.  I actually understood  everything he said the second time I saw it and found him pretty  amusing.
Some portrayals of the battle scenes where really silly such as  the Gungans and Droid armies facing off like some battle of the Ancient  world with Romans against the barbarians.  I mean they had all these high  tech weapons and instead of fighting the way we would today over massive  land areas they marched out into an open field and lined up.  For cinematic  effect I guess it had to be that way but it personnally annoyed me.
I  found the potrayal of the Jedi in the movie to fascinating and the  lightsabre battle at the end was one of the most impressive battle scenes I  have ever scene.",949536000,2,2060,4.553424657534246
672457,4,6303454038,"I look at The Phantom Menace and I see a very good film.  An excellent story line, breath-taking special effects, and wonderful acting all put together into one amazing feature.  There are just a few minor problems  with this film as the beginning of the Star Wars saga.  Even longer than  I can recall I have been entranced by the epic saga of the Star Wars films.  I saw the magic that George Lucas can create, but this film has lost a  small portion of that magic.  While I do agree that the effects on this  film were astonishing, I feel that computers were over-used.  Anyone who  has seen the original trilogy knows that Mr. Lucas & Lucasfilm don't  need all of this modern technology & CGI to take our breath away, but  now that they have it they don't know where to draw the line.  The special  editions of the originals were fabulously done because all they did was  mainly a touch-up job with the re-addition of some cut scenes.  On Episode  1 however, everything uses computers.  They created an entire race (the  Gungans) that never showed up on the set.  They made shields for ships,  droids, and even live characters that appear on screen with a bluish tint.  Lucas never had to use computers to come up with characters or alien races  that captivated his audience, look at Chewie, the Ewoks, or the entire  cantina scene from the first movie.  The original films, and even the  special editions of them, did fabulous without the audience seeing the  Millenium Falcon's deflector shields, we just knew they were there (in  fact, the lack of those shields allowed us to see the pain-staking detail  that had been put into the ship), and if they weren't there we were always  told about it (""Chewie, we're losing our rear deflector  shield!"").  In this day and age everyone uses computers and CGI, and  everyone tries to do it better than the last guy.  If your reading this,  Mr. Lucas, my advice is don't jump on that bandwagon.  If you want to  really shock and amaze people show them what you can do _without_  computers, not with them.  Show us that you can do without CGI technology  what most people couldn't even do with it like a lot of us already know.  Also, back on the subject of ships, the only ship that I remember from this  is the Naboo Fighter.  I didn't expect the Falcon, X-wings, Y-wings, Star  Destroyes, TIE Fighters, or Slave 1 to show up, but there were no really  memorable or outstanding vessels on this movie.  How many of the ships on  this movie actually had a name?  I never heard any, just types of ships  (i.e. the afore mentioned Naboo Fighter).  Why is that?  Now the  characters in this film are fabulous, and very well portrayed by the actors  and actresses cast for them.  These are character that we know, or even  better, that we _thought_ we knew but are just now learning the details of.  And the new additions to the Star Wars family are just as intriguing.  The  one exception would be Jar Jar Binks.  I am not one of the ""death to  Jar Jar"" people, but it is obvious that this character was designed  only to bring in the younger viewers.  Based on opinions I got from other  viewers after watching the film (at least 20 after each of the 6 times I  saw it), it seems that this character appeals to the age group of 5 and  below.  What they are not taking into account is that in 1977 they didn't  have a Barney wannabe and it still captivated several children in that very  age group, myself included.  I wasn't even 2 yet, but my mother took me to  see Star Wars and she swares that I never turned away from the screen and  never made a sound to interupt it; and I have met over 100 people with  similar stories since I have been on-line.  Even with the defects I have  named above though, this is still an excellent film.  The story alone is  enough to outweigh the defects, but when you add to that the great  characters and marvelous acting it still turns out a masterpiece.  I  commend George Lucas, and the entire cast & crew, for the they work put  into this film.  I give 4 out of 5 stars, the faults listed above being the  reasons for the loss of that 5th star.

Most of the ""extras""  were digital computerized characters.
I also thought that lack of any  love interest, witty comments and comic relief (i.e., Hans Solo)really  detracted from the film.
Lastly, I thought the acting was SOOOOO DRY!  There was so little emotion, that it was really hard to get involved in the  plot.

  Most special effects  in movies seem like they're made by a kid who recently figured out how to  animate on his/her new computer. Lucas has style and know-how. These are  not wasted special effects. They're not thrown around or wasted  pointlessly, they're used when the situation calls for them, and never in  excessive amounts.
  If you liked the first three (or should I say  last three) you'll love this souped up version. Todays technology has given  Industrial Light and Magic (Lucas' production company) a new instrument,  but it seems like they've had this tool for years, because they definently  know what to do with it.
  If you're looking for romance or comedy or  intellectual stimulation, you may want to avoid this movie, but if you want  something good to look at, this is a must-buy.",949276800,4,1421,4.647773279352227

672642,5,6303454038,"Well, what can I say? Storyline wise this is an inventive and origonal peice of cinematic brilliance. The special effects were great, with the Pod-Racing scene being the most absorbing. The acting by Liam Neeson and  Ray Park was convincing and realistic, and it finished with a  cliff-hanger!  If you haven't seen it, WHY?  One of last years best  films. Brilliant!",949276800,22,366,4.934426229508197
672643,4,6303454038,"My, and I believe nearly everyone's favourite ""Star Wars""-movie is Episode V-""The Empire Strikes Back"". Not only because it was visually the most dazzling, it also had far more sense of wonder and magic  than the other Episodes. Never had a ""Star Wars""-film a greater  emotional impact.
""The Phantom Menace"" is definetly not on par  with that film, nor has it the originality of ""A New Hope"", but  still I liked this film a lot. I actually found it better than ""Return  Of The Jedi"". Even those who dispised the movie must acknowledge that  it has its merits. The special effects are fantastic, and in contrast to  other films with superior FX, they are also highly imaginative because they  create entire worlds of their own. Individual action-setpieces are among  the most exhilarating of the decade (the pod-race or the final  lightsaber-duel among others) and John William's score is one of the major  assets again.
Many complained that Jar Jar Binks is too silly and  childish. This criticism is understandable though I think many people  overreacted with their hatred towards this character. He actually has some  funny moments. That the film doesn't have a villain that is as effective as  Darth Vader is true and false. The villain does not YET appear as the  villain which will (hopefully) make him even more evil in the next  pictures. The decision to conceal the true menace (careful viewers still  found it of course) is already implied in the Episode's title, so it was  obviously deliberate. This must be the reason why Darth Maul is used so  rarely. The character has just no significance for the whole saga. One must  not forget that TMP is not a film, but the first two hours of a  13-hour-saga. It was therefore inevitable that it would be less dramatic as  ""Empire"".
The bottom line is that despite some shortcomings,  Episode I effectively sets up the future Episodes. I agree with those who  say that George Lucas should have underlined some of the darker aspects of  the story more than he did. Let's hope he will do so in the next two  chapters which have the potential to become even stronger movies. If the  new trilogy finally sucks, it won't be because of ""The Phantom  Menace"".",949276800,125,2205,4.7592592592592595
672644,2,6303454038,"Ok, I'd like to pose a question. Why is George Lucas A Big Talent? Why? He directed two films, then created a studio, wrote other films and is one of the most respected directors of all time. <p>This film was just so bland. I  got some good laughs though, Liam Neeson and Ewan Macgregor just acting so  serious while talking to characters such as JAr Jar Binks and a flying  troll had me cracking up. Also the obviously stereotyped japanese aliens I  found very funny and also offensive. <p>The Light saber showdown was such a  letdown! The fight was horrible! Hasnt anyone seen a Shaw Brothers film?  Akira Kurosawa? Ring a bell? It was really shot bad! log takes and editing  was nowhere near quick enough. This film was really bad.

672766,4,6303454038,"Although I don't share the ""this movie sucks"" opinion that others share, I must say ""Episode 1"" lived up to my expectations of a movie coming out of my favorite triology of films in the history of  filmmaking.
Well what can I say, its got the reflecting light of the  original trilogy, its got fun and fast action scenes. Killer special  effects. But the character development is a lil poor (but what does that  matter anyway). Overall, a fun entertaining experience as long as people  stop comparing it to the original ""Star Wars"" and the better  sci-fi release in 1999 ""The Matrix"".",949104000,9,584,4.676470588235294
672767,2,6303454038,"This is the kind of film best viewed only once, as it's really designed with eye-candy lovers in mind and once you've seen the special effects there's nothing else of interest.
This prequel to the Star Wars saga  isn't a patch on the other three films.  The CGI special effects are very  nice, yes, and it was good to see that title sequence again after all these  years, not to mention the odd cameos by characters such as Yoda and Jabba  the Hutt.  But films today are sadly about money, not entertainment.  The  large varities of aliens are included in this film merely to sell models,  the pod race is intended to sell a video game and the whole thing reeks of  commercialism.  Yes, alright, so there are some famous actors, but why are  they there if they're not even given a chance to actualy act?  Added to  that is the fact that the two Jedi knights sleepwalk through the whole  thing.
There are some good moments, true.  The Emporer-to-be is a  wonderfully scheming character and Darth Maul is effective, though it's  rather a shame he is underused.
Some might say that this film shouldn't  be too dark or sinister.  But surely it shouldn't be on the level of a  cartoon.  There is far too much comic relief, most of the aliens are the  Muppets relived and the underwater 'fish eaten by bigger fish eaten by  still bigger fish' sequence is straight out of a Monty Python  sketch.

George Lucas should  put this film back in his (explative) where it belongs; right next to his  head. PS: Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying ethnic slur that I have ever  seen in my life.

This movie should be on DVD. VHS can't do it  justice. It's a shame Lucas isn't on the DVD bandwagon because a many of  his fans watch the Star Wars movies because they want to enjoy the art of  it. I'll not spoil a good movie with a VHS viewing just to turn around and  buy it a year later on DVD.

I can guarentee that this site will soon be filled with  ""I hate Jar-Jar"" reviews.  Although he did supply the movie with  comic relief, I don't think he fit in with the sci-fi genre.  Which brings  me to the only thing I didn't like about the movie:  It was too  child-orientatated, but I guess that was what George Lucas might have been  aiming for.  The special effects were mind-blowing, and the action scenes  were breath-taking.  It was well worth the wait.  All the actors did a  superb performance as well.

The names Skywalker, The Force, and Jedi Knight have been mentioned in more movies, books or interviews than anyother piece of art (except the  Bible). In this first installment of the Star Wars epic, George Lucas  skillfully creates a world full of exotic creatures and grand cities. This  is the world, of course, before the dark times. Before the rise of the  Empire. Just like Tolkien, Lucas uses mythology combined with the Human  spirit. Those who have seen the original trilogy will love the new  charecters. Those who havn't seen them will marvel at the art work. In this  movie, their is no Luke Skywalker, or Han Solo to save the world. It takes  place a few years before the outbreak of the Empire. The charecters here  create a new, remarkable band of heros. Watch this movie. Don't listen to  the idiotic critics.

This crisp, vibrant reproduction, of what George Lucas would ideally have us all watching in the cinema is a great technical feat, and possibly the most colorful movie ever to appear on your little TV  set.
The digital production means that colors are so vibrant that the  galaxy we are transported to seems almost surreal at times, even on the  small screen.  Add that to sounds that we have all become familiar with  over the past 20 years (the laser blasts, R2D2, lines such as ""I have  a bad feeling about this..."") and you have an audio visual experience  that is anything but a passive one.  The small screen version thankfully  does not show up the 'effects' to be just that, as with Titanic.
Somewhat  sadly, the storyline and particularly characterisation lacks a little, but  the familiarity with certain characters helps many fill in the blanks - it  is certainly a worthy introduction to Star Wars for a whole new generation  who instead of growing up with Air Hockey and Pong, grew up with Zelda and  Mario.",949017600,5,1117,4.656410256410257
