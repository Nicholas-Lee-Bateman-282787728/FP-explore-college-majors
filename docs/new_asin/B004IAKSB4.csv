8430523,5,B004IAKSB4,"Basically the biographical film of Dhirubhai Ambani who was before his death in 2002 one of the most influential business men in all of India and was a true Rags to Riches story. Read up on it on wikipedia or use one of it's quoted sources on the bottom of the article. Very interesting person as most powerful people are.

For the purposes of the film review i will keep it short. Teachers son goes to turkey to work for a living his constant disapproving father is what's driving him through most of his life. He gives up a good solid job to gamble on his own business and marries a girl with a fair amount of dowry for that time period. They fall in love despite it being initially for money and friendship. This is their story and it's a Damn good one. All characters were very well played and the Bachchans once again prove why they are one of the premiere acting families in India. This film not only had subtlety but had a great ability to do a fairly good outline on historicaly relevant Business Mogul. That's not only hard to say , it's hard to achieve. Abhishek plays him with just enough restraint and humor to make him seem more real and less like say a Sarkar like character. Though I did love him in both of those ( HIM not the music). This isn't really Aish's movie but she get's to shine in a few places in the movie as the supportive infrastructure of his life.  Vidya Balan  is the aging little daughter to full maturity of a Newspaper man who is at war with ABi. She has  M.S.. excellent subtle character part of her husband is played by Madhaven a Tamil film star who looks great in the part.  Behind every great man there's a great woman? Behind every great woman there's a ....lot of best freinds? their children hmmm.... Don't miss the rousing speech at the end it's a very good one man showcase for Abihishek. This one is a KEEPER.",1336694400,,1856,4.32183908045977
