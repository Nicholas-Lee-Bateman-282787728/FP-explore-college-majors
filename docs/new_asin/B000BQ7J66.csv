2436705,2,B000BQ7J66,"If this movie gives you the Heebie Jeebies, then you have not seen a truly scary horror movie. This movie is not scary and cheaply made. To make this review quick: A young girl dreams that her mother dies and then she does and then she begins dreaming that her friends die and in order to prevent this from happening, she gets them all to meet at a place where she thinks they will be safe. End of story. Another disappointing film.",1141344000,,432,4.280487804878049
2436706,4,B000BQ7J66,"Awesome movie! great camera works, the story is realy nice, what an end! never would have tought. realy worth watching!",1137888000,2,119,5.0
2436707,5,B000BQ7J66,Well worth the price!  Kept me up all night! Fantastic ending.  Where can I see more of the actress who played Kelly?,1135987200,,117,4.2727272727272725
2436708,1,B000BQ7J66,This movie is very cheaply made and is so disjointed that it makes little sense.  Flashbacks are given that just confuse the story.  I did not care for this film at all.  I love good horror movies but this is not one of them.,1135555200,,225,4.068181818181818
2436709,5,B000BQ7J66,I usually don't buy these types of movies but I liked the story line.  All I can say is this movies is scary.  I've only been scared by one other movie in my life and that was when I was 5.  Not only is this movies scary but it has a real weird funny humour to it.  I would definitily reccommend this movie to anyone.,1133740800,2,317,3.830769230769231
8090923,3,B000BQ7J66,"Seeing a lot of hate for this flick based mostly on its budget it seems. It's a good concept and story, hindered clearly by budgetary and resource limitations. The structure is kind of an anthology, but with an unusually drawn-out framing story. Over-frequent use of dissolve transitions gives an amateur feel, but all in all I enjoyed it and would watch other films by the same folks. I watched it on DVD and can't say much positive about the transfer, for what I know of such things.",1497225600,,485,4.586206896551724
8090924,1,B000BQ7J66,"When this movie first came out I saw it by renting it from Blockbuster. This movie has stuck with me for around 10 years as being one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Everything in it terrible, it's one of those movies that you would think is so bad that it's good but no, it's just bad. Bad acting, bad writing, really low budget, nothing about it is good. You should watch this movie if you want to have a story to tell people about just how bad this movie is and all the stupid things that happen in it. If you already have a movie you can laugh about with your friends save yourself from the torture of watching this movie.",1439078400,,632,4.104838709677419
8090925,4,B000BQ7J66,"I thought this movie was good for a low budget flick.  The reason I don't say great is because two of the scariest movies of all time were low budget (TCM and NLD).  I think they did the best they could with an awesome story and a low budget.  Regardless of what you might read in the other reviews of this movie, all scenes do tie in to the plot.  It wasn't until the third time that I understood how the ""interlude"" (as others have called it) fit into the story line.  I am an avid horror movie fan, and I believe this was worth watching.  In fact, I watched it 3 times.  So I say, for inexperienced actors and film makers with a low budget, this is a good movie.  It caught me by surprise.",1364515200,,692,4.036764705882353
8090926,1,B000BQ7J66,One of the dumbest movies.  I'm dumber now for having watched it.  I would like to see to the people who made this movie and throw rotten tomatoes at them.  Poor acting.  Nonsensical plot.  Confusing randomness.  My head hurt after watching this.,1213401600,,246,4.738095238095238
8090927,1,B000BQ7J66,"I started to watch this movie and after the first 30 minutes into it, I realized that it had no story and I had started to fall asleep. I don't even want to admit that I had bought it. I am just glad that I didn't pay anymore than $3 for it. It isn't even worth the plastic that it took to make it. Avoid this movie at all costs and save your money for a good B horror flick.",1174780800,,375,3.7
8090928,1,B000BQ7J66,"Earlier in the year it was my misfortune to sit through this really stupid movie. I even made the mistake of buying the DVD!! Afterwards i took it back to the place i bought it at and exchanged it for another used dvd.

  Seemed to start out like a pretty descent movie then somewhere along the way, whoever was writing the script put the last half of it in a screader. Then someone else wrote the rest of it...

  There is one scene in the middle that has no point at all being in it but to really disgust you. It did and i would of throwed it away if they hadn't exchanged it for another movie. Which i chose ""UNDEAD"" a far superior horror movie!!

  It's a shame this movie was even filmed. Afterwards i wanted the hour and thirty minutes back of my life that i spent watching it. If you are into disgusting horror scenes the middle of the film will probally be the only thing of interest.

  To me it just made me hate it more. Makes you wonder what they can get away with in a horror movie. I wouldn't sit through the movie again if you paid me.

  If you plan on renting it or watching it in the horror section and you seen ""HEEBIE JEEBIES"" or ""UNDEAD"" chose the later. I'd of given it ""NO"" stars if that would of been possible.

8090929,1,B000BQ7J66,"Low budget rip off of every horror movie ever made, HEEBIE JEEBIES is incoherent, poorly filmed and horribly acted, and doesn't make one iota of common sense.

A distraught young woman who dreamed her mother would be killed and which came true, decides to invite some of her friends to a deserted old house because she's dreamed they'all be killed if she doesn't protect them.

Boy does she screw up there!  But so what..everything is so chaotically dumb, you don't care one little bit and when it's all done, you have to ask yourself, can anyone make a decent horror film anymore???",1158969600,,583,4.696078431372549
8090930,2,B000BQ7J66,"this movie is not special and its not the worst film I have sver seen. the movie has the typical kids in distress.  weird chick in high school want to have a reunion at a run down farm(probably that is all the movie makers could afford).  holding a reunion at a barn?--you know your in trouble.  your basic stupid behavior from stupid kids makes for good slicing and dicing.  I have no trouble with movies like this, but this movie did not move very fast. blood and gore were more than enough with a homage to FARGO in a dream.  cast very non-discript and I hope they got paid well.  one nice special effect with CGI probably burst the budget(it was nice few seconds).  while I can't recommend this movie, I am just going to tell you--YOU COULD DO ALOT WORSE!!.  bigger budget and better pacing would have helped and I hope they learn from this, so maybe their next movie will be worth me making popcorn for.",1154131200,4,908,4.363095238095238
8090931,2,B000BQ7J66,"Dan O'Bannon(writer of Alien, director of Return of the Living Dead) is quoted as saying this low budget effort is ""a cut above the competition"".  Well, I'll admit that it's slightly better than some of the direct to video junk out there(Near Death & The Horror Within spring directly to mind), but not by much.

The basic plot of Heebie Jeebies actually has potential.  A young woman who predicted her mother's death in a dream is now having similar dreams about some of her former high school classmates.  To keep them safe she invites them to a dilapidated house in the middle of the woods.  Why couldn't she have just invited them to IHOP?  Seems that would be a much safer place.  That's just the beginning of this film's problems.

Waaaayyyyy too much time is spent on reenactments of the main character's deadly dreams.  They completely take us out of the main story and just add to the viewer's frustration.  The one dream sequence about the killer statues(yep, you read that right) seems to go on forever.

Oh, another problem comes when the killer is revealed.  If an explanation was given for the motive, I must have missed it.

Perhaps I'm being generous for giving this 2 stars.  The film did try to be different.  The acting was okay,  nothing special.  Like I said earlier, the storyline had potential.  Maybe with a better script and director this could have been something special.",1147996800,,1398,4.706611570247934
8090932,1,B000BQ7J66,"One day, I was in my local video rental place with a friend. We were of course looking for campy popcorn movies to make fun of. He told me of ""Heebie Jeebies."" which he promised was the best movie ever made, because it was [paradoxically] the worst movie ever made. I agreed, ingested a ton of caffeine, and painfully trudged through this ""thinking man's slasher film."" (Which the back of the DVD case assures with all the conviction of a used car salesman.) What I saw was the most dull, digressive horror movie ever with a predictable, telegraphed ending that literally inflicts physical pain on fans of good movies.

The premise is a bunch of kids in some cabin/slaughterhouse/haunted house/can't remember. There's a killer, of course. She eats hair. Yes, she eats hair. I guess all the ""spooky masks"" were taken, so they needed a gimmick. The plot is essentially some autistic girl telling her dumb friends who are all for some reason still hanging around in the house her irrelevant dreams-- All of which are examined in 20 minute dream sequences. The trick the director tried to play is that none of the dreams have anything to do with the plot, but, *gasp* someone from the final dream hits the surviving girl in a car. But as I said earlier, it was telegraphed to the point it was predictable as a ""like that one time..."" sequence in a Family Guy episode.

There are no positive points to this film. It's so bad, it logically shouldn't exist. It should collapse in on itself, and be sucked into a singularity of sophomoric crap. Even the gore is pathetic. There's this one scene involving a massive meat grinder. But Heebie Jeebies, always quick to smash my dreams, made the meat grinder spit out a thin stream of mud or chocolate syrup when it went to work on someone. If I taught a class of aspiring directors, I'd name the class ""How to avoid making Heebie Jeebies.""
