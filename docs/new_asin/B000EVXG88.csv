2540433,5,B000EVXG88,"I teach 6-12 year olds at church.  We absolutely loved this movie!  It is an excellent portrayal of what Jesus did for us over 2,000 years ago.  The kids did get confused at one point (when Jesus came out of the tomb with a bright light instead of angels rolling away the stone), but other than that it is excellent!  This is a DVD that we will keep in our collection for many years.",1237507200,3,383,4.135135135135135
2540434,5,B000EVXG88,"My 3-year old daughter LOVES this DVD!  It's a great video to introduce and teach your kids about the Easter story.  The characters are fun and the music is quite good.  I normally don't enjoy ""kid music"", but I really find the music in this video to be modern and I find myself (and my daugher) singing along to the music often.  This would probably make a great Easter musical play as well.  I highly recommend it!",1236556800,2,416,4.35064935064935

8114732,5,B000EVXG88,My sunday school class of children love this movie. I am not a big user of dvd's for teaching but this is the exception-gets a great message to the children and older children ask to borrow it to take home to show their parents.  great fun,1391904000,,239,4.195652173913044
8114733,5,B000EVXG88,"I teach music to our Sunday School students, and they are quite savvy when it comes to the more ""upbeat"", non-traditional types of music. I really wanted to get something that would reach them, and this fits the bill. The DVD has a complete story, a chapter selections, AND music selections. I added sign language to ""Hosanna"", and it's really brought the whole group (primary and middle elementary) together.",1362096000,,409,4.942028985507246

We buy these for our 4 year old daughter who within a day or so will be singing the songs and quoting the verses, even more amazing is she understands the basic concept of the verses as well!  Wish there were more of them!",1320710400,,247,4.020408163265306
