8739977,5,B017PAYFQC,"There are 85,000 dietary supplements on sale in the US. FDA does not do any review of dietary supplements before it comes to the market when it comes to safety or effectiveness. FDA has only 25 employees to address the safety of those 85,000 supplements. This is a 30 billion dollar industry and that is only the 2015 statistics. The sad part of this documentary is and will be that majority if not all who are consuming supplements who will be watching this documentary will continue consuming those dietary supplements regardless of all the facts that was provided in this documentary which once again in this documentary it is continuously proven that supplements are not proven to be safe or effective.

Diet is the only way to get nutrients but one thing that I have noticed year after year in many individuals that I know who are consuming supplements is that they could care less for their health. Majority who trust this unregulated industry are individuals who happen to be after a quick fix for their health when there is no such approach other than healthy diet, less stress, physical and mental activity. Many will blame the government, the supplement company, the FDA except themselves since once again they have no interest in being healthy but yet they expect to be healthy for few pennies that they pay for few pills in a container. The saddest part of the supplement business is that many parents will listen to a showman like Dr. OZ who has continuously promoted supplements and has even claimed that he is a proud consumer of supplement and feeds his family those unregulated supplements when infact he does all in the name of financial gain but the same parents will feed their children the same unregulated supplements due to their lack of knowledge and common sense without any consideration for other human life in name of trusting marketers like Dr. OZ. There is no solution to a happy and healthy human physical mind and body except healthy fresh food ingredients, less stress, physical and mental activity. There are no short cuts when it comes to health regardless of the pay. There is no bandaid approach; it requires work, lots of work to be healthy.",1453161600,9,2179,4.779840848806366
