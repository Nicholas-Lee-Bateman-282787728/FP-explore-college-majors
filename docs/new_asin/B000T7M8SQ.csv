8207978,3,B000T7M8SQ,I really want a copy of the older version of the film with Briggite Fossey but as yet I cannot find one with English subtitles.,1506902400,,127,4.12
8207979,3,B000T7M8SQ,"Having read the book a dozen times over the years, I was very disappointed. the film had none of the charm of the novel.",1360540800,,120,4.041666666666667
8207980,5,B000T7M8SQ,"I bought this film as a fan of Jean-Baptiste Maunier, and it was completely worth it. Though he is not the protagonist, the movie was an excellent buy. It has an engaging plot and characters, including Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy in the cast.",1360281600,3,243,4.951219512195122
8207981,2,B000T7M8SQ,"I was happy when this showed up on my French TV channel, TV Cinq Monde. I assumed it was the 1967 classic. But no. This 2006 film is not awful, exactly, but it is pedestrian and conveys NOTHING of the enchantment of the book, which was caught so well in the '67 version.",1308355200,9,270,4.113207547169812
8207982,1,B000T7M8SQ,In my youth this was one of my favorite movies. The party scene in the original was absolutely enchanting. This version altogether lacked the magic and exacting beauty of the original.,1307145600,7,184,4.967741935483871
8207983,2,B000T7M8SQ,"Unfortunately this is not a good movie. Crucial events of one of my favorite books are not found in the movie. With giant steps the director walks through the story, Alain Fournier's popular Le Grand Meaulnes. Camerawork is ok. Acting not bad. It's nice to see France in 1910. But director Verhaeghe should take the time to tell the story of Augustin Meaulnes, his strange adventure, mystery of the lost castle, the story of the gypsy and so on.",1195257600,22,445,4.6455696202531644
