1950237,4,B0000VD12I,"I was really chuffed to see both Conan Movies for a low price on DVD, the picture quality is great but the sound mmmmhhhhh not to good but who's complaining for this price. The only downside was that the manufacturers made a flap for the some sort of booklet but I did not recieve anything atall is this a Scam or is it a genuine mistake? if anyone knows I would be happy to know. All in all a great buy for this price and neat packaging, both movies on a double layered 1 disc.",1093046400,4,478,4.042105263157895
1950238,5,B0000VD12I,"I love the Conan movies. Conan was the movie that put Arnold on the map as a Hollywood action actor. Conan-The Complete Quest is a great way to get both of these movies real cheap.

This DVD will cost you as much as either one will by itself. You basicly get just the movies. They are in widescreen format and everything is great.

Conan the Barbarian does have some specials. They talk about the making of the movie and there is commentary for the movie. The interviews on the making are great. The director, writers, producers, and Arnold are all there as they talk about it. I loved seeing Oliver Stone talk about it.

To see Conan the Destroyer you just flip the disk over. This contains just the movie and no extras. This one isn't as good as the first movie, but hey who cares it's Arnold and he's Conan.

If you want the Conan movies on DVD this is your best buy. The specials for the first one are good, but they aren't as good as the Special Edition versions of the other DVD's. Like I said this is a great deal because you get to great movies for the price of one. Don't miss out on a deal like that.",1092182400,6,1110,4.197183098591549
1950239,4,B0000VD12I,"What do you get when you wrap Arnold Schwarzenegger in some leather and give him a big sword? You get two great movies for less than half the price of the individual DVD releases. With Amazon's current price on this release you definitely can't go wrong with this one. Both movies are in their 2:35:1 aspect ratio and the picture is clear and crisp. The Digital Dolby 2.0 sound is pretty good; my only real complaint on the sound is that it should have been remastered in 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound. That's the only reason why I give this DVD release 4 stars.

What can you say about Arnold Schwarzenegger; he is and will always be the one and only ""Conan the Barbarian"". I didn't receive any booklet with my discs, in my opinion most booklets are useless anyway because most of the time you can access everything directly from your menu button on the DVD player. The Conan the Barbarian / Conan the Destroyer movies are pure entertainment for the action and adventure fan, however due to some scenes of graphic violence, they may not be suitable for younger children.

I guess these will do for now given the decent bundled pricing. One quick question. Did anyone receive a booklet in the left sleeve of this set? There's an empty pocket in mine and it seemed weird.

1950441,5,B0000VD12I,"Review for Conan The Complete Quest DVD:  This dvd pack is worth it just for the extended edition of Milius's Conan The Barbarian.  It's beautifully shot, beautifully scored, and a very memorable film. Its a coming of age story, and a revenge story featuring humanities most beloved archetype, that of the hero. Milius took a good Robert E. Howard character and setting then put his own artistic vision on it. The result is downright Wagnerian. I'm not much of a Fantasy genre fan, but I love this movie. This is the film catapulted Schwarzenegger into a mainstream actor. James Earl Jones is amazing as Thulsa Doom. The relationship between the villain and hero is one of the most brilliant ones I've seen. He is not just the anithesis of the hero, but the catalyst of him taking on the archetype.  Then there is of course the memorable quotes and the riddle of steel theme. The sum of all these things make it a great movie.

As for the sequel, well it is pretty forgettable, It lacks what made the original great. It is a dumbed down action film with a lackluster quest and a stale ""comedic relief"" character. The good thing is you get two movies for the price of one. They come on one double sided disc but its still a good deal. That being said, considering the money, what is there to complain about?

Bottom line is this is a good starting point for those new to the series, or for those who want the extended edition of Conan The Barbarian. Until the extended edition is released on Bluray with a great treatment, including a healthy dose of extras, this will do for me.",1432080000,3,1578,4.503496503496503

If not....wait....the movie is a perfectly good way to spend an afternoon.  Watching Arnold read Conan's lines in his thick accent brings me back to the 80's each time.

1950484,5,B0000VD12I,"What is the hidden riddle of steal?

Conan the Barbarian is one of the greatest action adventure (even sci fi) films of all time.  First saw both Conan movies when I was a very young kid and like other franchises from my youth ""Star Wars"", ""Star Trek"", ""Highlander"", ""Terminator"", ""Indiana Jones"" ect this one is right up there among what I consider to be the best.

Based on Robert E. Howard's fantasy character, this duel film series takes some of it's own Hollywood turns and twists with the original material themed around Arnold Schwarzenegger.

 Very basic story of young hero set out on quest of adventure, along with both revenge and justice for the brutal murders of his family and their Cimmarian village at the hands of an evil sorcerer played by who else (James Earl Jones aka- Darth Vader).

 Conan learns how to be brutal and vicious in the pit of mortal combat, and then travels East where he is taught the martial skills from the grand masters. He even quotes Ghengis Khan at some point in the film.

  This film was highly successful when it came out, and has remained a mythologically themed classic ever since, but there are those who had claimed Conan represents (anti-feminism) which clearly isn't true, along with idealizing Fascism.  People have taken their own ideological political spin upon these movies which is in my view absurd.

There is absolutely no Fascism in Conan, in fact if anything his portrayal and actions suggest that of a man who is first and formost more wild and outside the norms of society, and Fascists want total state conformity where the idealized man is one who lives, breaths, fights, and dies for the whims of the political party and the state itself. A wild man in tights running around the wilderness riding a horse and fighting both knights and creatures with his sword wondering from city to city, is NOT Fascism in any sense.

 On the anti-feminism charge, one can clearly fire back and state the movie absolutely does depict strong women who are equal with men in the form of Conan's girlfriend and fellow adventurer.  Second he is a freedom fighter who doesn't believe in following tyrannical despotic leaders, for the on the contrary he is the one that defies them.

Fascism and Communism both represent extreme ideals that demand conformity and total worship and obedience to the state (and their leadership) with no individual identity or individual notions of rights and freedoms. Fascism's boogieman is race (and also the racial enemy) they perceive as inferior and a threat, while Communism's boogieman is economic and social class (along with race, money, and gender victimhood themes they push on their population).  Victimhood and the idea to use the state as a tool to avenge their perceived victimhood is a strong theme in both Fascism and Communism, and thus NO where in Conan does he look at himself as a helpless victim.

His victimhood if there is any is his need to bring justice for the slaughter of his noble family.

  Conan does not represent any political, religious, or ideological theme in any sense other then an individual man who is fighting for freedom against brutal oppression and diabolical brain washing ""group think- follow an evil leader"" cult movements.

 Saying that Conan represent the ideal Aryan supremacy is ridiculous, the comparison Conan may have is that he is a super strong blond Nordic looking hero, but he has NO other connection to anything Aryan nor it's ideals.  Critics will place their own spins on just about anything.

 The mythological themes of mastering an idealized focused weaponry, in this case learning the secret of steel in the form of a sword.  We learn it really isn't the weapon itself that makes one a great fighter, it is that warrior who uses that weapon wisely that finds greatness.

And we have another traditional mythological theme where Conan dies and is reborn.  Conan and his friends take the dangerous journey into the heart of the Underworld- Hades (in the form of James Earl Jones's kingdom), they fight, they suffer, and they sacrifice in order to defeat their adversary and bring justice to the land.

  The second film isn't as great because they had toned everything down in order to make it a PG film, and the plot isn't nearly as good but I still enjoyed it anyway and will recommend it even though it doesn't come close to the first film.

 I would say these movies are fun for teen and adult audiences, way too violent for youngsters and obviously the first is very rated R.

 Hope to see more Conan films like the first movie in the future, because they are awesome adventures.  ""What doesn't kill you, will make you stronger.""",1422144000,,4674,4.790262172284645

1950551,3,B0000VD12I,"This is a double sided disc. There are two movies: Conan the Barbarian side A and Conan the Destroyer side B. It's the complete quest. It is worth mentioning that Conan the Barbarian has a big issue. They forget about the aging process. The bad guys look the same throughout the movie while Conan changes dramatically as he grows up. Big mistake. A big no, no. The special effects are not very good either. This goes for both movies. But then again, these movies were filmed in the 80's so I cannot expect the best quality of special effects. Conan sword-fighting scenes are good and you can see Arnold does not have a problem handling the sword. He was made for this role. I do not like how they excluded the archer from part two. Instead of the archer, they have a fool help Conan and he has no fighting skills whatsoever. The archer in Conan the Barbarian played a main role and they completely forget about him in Conan the Destroyer. Not good. Both movies have English, French, and Spanish subtitles (aspect ratio 2.35:1 widescreen). Conan the Barbarian is just in English while Conan the Destroyer is in English or French.  It is worth mentioning that the sound quality in Conan the Destroyer is not that good. It is more noticeable when there is dialogue.",1366416000,,1262,4.584070796460177

1950575,5,B0000VD12I,"There is no doubt that Arnold Schwarzenegger was made for this role.  I have seen a couple remakes of Conan the last few years and none of them compare to these two original Conan movies with Arnold.  This movie series was developed from the Conan the Barbarian book series, which is about the life and times of a man whose family was killed and he was captured and made a slave.  He developed into a big strong fighter winning all his battles until he owner let him free.

I admit to being an Arnold Schwarzenegger fan and the Conan films are probably the best ones he has made in his movie career.  He, of course, is legendary having won the Mr. Olympia contest numerous times before he became a movie star and previous Governor of California.  The price is also very reasonable for this two movie set.

In conclusion, if you are a fan of the Conan the Barbarian series or just love great action movies, you will enjoy this Conan The Complete Quest movie set.

The second one isn't quite what the first one was but if you like pulp like fantasy adventures then these are good movies.  Ive watched them more times than is probably healthy to admit, one a lot more than two for sure, but they are still a good time.  I was hoping the latest version of Conan would have been good enough to breathe life back into this character but it doesnt look that way.  He is still the character that every RPGer makes when they are 14, all of his stats are a bit higher than believable, though still a good time.",1362096000,,721,4.056338028169014

1950580,4,B0000VD12I,"Looking at the Conan films today it's easy to dismiss them as silly old B movies, but in their day they helped shape the direction of cinema. By the time Conan the Barbarian came to the big screen, sword-and-sandal flicks, popularized by legions of Hercules films in the 60s and the stop-motion monsters of Ray Harryhausen, were already played out. Conan changed the game with brutal, realistic violence, a rough, ruined world full of dangerous warriors, and of course the epic, primal soundtrack of Basil Poledouris, who would go on to score such luminary 80s films as Red Dawn and Robocop.

Conan the Barbarian stars Arnold Schwarzenegger in the title role. When Conan's village is destroyed and his family killed he is sold into slavery. Years later, his body honed by gladiatorial fighting and mercenary combat he unexpectedly makes his way to freedom. For a time, he leads an adventurer's life with newfound friends Valeria the Amazon (Sandahl Bergman) and Subotai the Mongol archer (Gerry Lopez). Inevitably though, Conan is led into a final showdown with the man who murdered his family: the evil snake-priest Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones, with a wig of beautiful blond rock hair).

There are certainly viewers who will balk at the summary alone, and who will find the film's limited special effects and deteriorated settings hard to pay attention to. But if you sit down and take Conan at face value, it's pretty easy to understand how it spawned the whole barbarian adventure sub-genre of film and other media. There's an operatic, over the top greatness to this film- one that the sequel sadly fails to capture.

Conan the Destroyer sees Conan tasked with rescuing a missing princess for a sorceress-queen. Unlike the first movie and its dark-ages assortment of blasted heaths and weather-worn cities, Destroyer features an abundance of predictable fantasy locales like magical castles and forested lakes. There are more special effects too, and more whimsical humor. These elements were added to broaden the film's appeal, but they sap it of its uniqueness and take it further from the essence of the violent, untamed pulp novellas that spawned it. The result is a movie that is imminently watchable but feels watered down and predictable. Red Sonja (not included in this set) takes much the same approach but succeeds far better, and I recommend watching it after destroyer to compare and contrast.

All in all, the 80s Conan films represent an important early step in Arnold Schwarzenegger's career, influential watermarks in cinema, and damn good adventure yarns. While Jason Momoa was a great Conan, and the 2011 film was in some ways truer to Robert Howard's stories, these are the movies I will always associate with Conan the Barbarian.

PROS:
-EPIC soundtrack
-Good action and buckets of gory violence
-Odd yet appropriate injections of humor
-A surprising volume of good actors chewing scenery and loving every minute of it
-Sandahl Bergman (if you take my advice and buy Red Sonja you get to see her pull a heel turn and play the evil Queen Gedren)!

CONS:
-Sequel is a little lackluster
-Special Effects are undeniably primitive

STUFF TO WATCH FOR
-In Conan the Barbarian Arnold punches a camel. In Conan the Destroyer he MAKES UP to the camel, but their relationship collapses and he decks it again. In the first movie, Arnold actually hit the camel, arousing the ire of the SPCA.
-He's heavily costumed, but the sharp-eyed may detect that the evil god at the end of Conan the Destroyer is in fact professional wrestling's Andre the Giant. That dude ruled!",1345161600,,3581,4.968280467445743

Conan the Destroyer: this film is not as long as the first, this film dose focus more on Arnold then it dose on Conan this film has far less violance and less blood and gore this one dose earn its PG rating however and dose continue the story of conan.

1950619,5,B0000VD12I,"Based on the books by Robert E. Howard the movies have a rich and detailed world to mine.  Wonderful landscapes (most of the first film was done in Spain), powerful music that blows other movies out of the threater, great stars such as James Earl Jones, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Grace Jones, Sandahl Bergman, Mako - well, I could go on and on.  The stories are simple and the action is packed.  In a time before a lot of computer special effects, many of the sets are real and the stunts are also real.
A good old fashion fantasy film.  But NOT for kids.  In my set, the first movie has some extras, including commentary by the director John Milius and actor Arnold himself!

1950621,5,B0000VD12I,"Arnold Schwarzenegger makes his break-through debut as one of the greatest fantasy heroes of all-time: CONAN THE BARBARIAN! A young boy is stripped from his homeland after a vicious warlord destroys his entire clan. Conan is forced into slavery and then trained to fight for his keep, but upon his release, he uses his new found strength and skill to track down the evil Thulsa Doom in his quest for revenge! The exotic locations and decorative set designs for CONAN exist far beyond the realm of our world, which allows director John Milius to transport us to a magical land that is filled with swords, giant serpents, and sorcery. Schwarzenegger is iconic as the legendary Cimmerian warrior, embodying strength, courage, and honor as he battles his way through the armies of his enemy. The rich storytelling and memorable characters help to transform the film into a modern epic. A large debt of this is owed specifically to the great James Earl Jones and his performance as the god-king Thulsa Doom, who commands the screen with his power and charisma. CONAN continues to rule as one of the defining films of its genre now nearly thirty-years after its release.

Conan the Barbarian returns to aid a young princess in a quest to fulfill her destiny, facing a number of perilous tasks and ruthless enemies along the way. In CONAN THE DESTROYER, our epic hero is reduced to a mere shell of his former self in a weak story that would have been better suited for the comic books. Schwarzenegger is fed a number of ridiculous lines that cross the line from comical to laughable. He is joined by a colorful band of warriors that fight alongside him, but the main thing that the sequel lacks is a strong central villain to serve as its focus. Without a Thulsa Doom for Conan to conquer, the plot wanders through various castles and dungeons with no real direction or purpose. Wilt Chamberlain, Grace Jones, and Olivia d'Abo deliver adequate performances, but the sense of camaraderie that existed in the previously film simply isn't there. Richard Fleischer does deliver a strong visual style and a number of impressive sets, two of the only characteristics that are carried over from the original. As sword-and-sorcery pictures go, CONAN THE DESTROYER has enough might and magic to please most genre fans, but the empty plotting leaves much to be desired.

Governor make a  King Conan  movie asap!",1268179200,,1083,5.1022727272727275
1950666,5,B0000VD12I,"When I first saw ""Conan the Barbarian"" I was a huge fan of the character and had repeatedly read all the original stories by Robert E. Howard and most of the new books and comics by various authors as well (which essentially stayed true to Howard's vision and spirit). Needless to say, I was psyched.

Anyone familiar with Howard's Conan must have been a little disappointed; I was HUGELY disappointed. Yeah, they got many things right, but the things they got wrong horribly ruined the film for me -- so much so that I didn't see it again for 15 YEARS!

Upon seeing it again, being older and more open-minded, I had to admit that I was well entertained. I've seen it a few more times since and now have to admit: This movie's a freakin' masterpiece! I say this with one condition: the viewer must know going in that this is an ALTERNATIVE Conan, similar to Howard's, but far from a strict interpretation.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: These flaws mostly have to do with John Milius and Oliver Stone's deviation from Howard. First of all, the opening sequence of Conan as a little boy on his fathers knee getting advice about the trustworthiness of the sword: Sorry, but the lad looks like an average soft suburbanite boy, not a tough kid that grew up in the wilds of Cimmeria, land of darkness and deep night. Secondly, the ""wheel of pain"" sequence is just dumb. I have a bit more respect for this part now that I realize it's a metaphor for the cyclical drudgery of grade school, but -- c'mon -- the REAL Conan wouldn't spend that many years in captivity! He would have escaped long before, not to mention slay his captors. Thirdly, when they first meet Valeria while robbing the temple of Set the flick cops a decidedly campy tone. Although Sandahl Bergman is great throughout the rest of the picture that initial meeting is pretty cringe-inducing. It was at this point that I really TUNED OUT when I first viewed the film. Fourthly, one of the worst parts is when Conan grovels at Thulsa Doom's feet crying, ""You killed my father, you killed my mother!"" This in no way resembles Howard's Conan.

WHAT WORKS: First of all, the score by Basil Poledouris is magnificent and awe-inspiring. Surely this is one of the greatest compositions ever written! The movie's worth watching just to hear this score -- no lie. Secondly, despite acceptable discrepencies (e.g. Conan has black hair not brown, etc.), the casting is great. Thirdly, Milius and Stone show their brilliance by incorporating Genghis Khan's historical quote in Conan's response to ""What is best in life?"" Conan answers: ""To crush enemies, see dem driven before you and to hear da lamentation of der women."" What a stroke of genius! Fourthly, the locations, sets and costuming are superb; they certainly got the LOOK of Robert E. Howard's Hyborian Age right. Fifth, As long as one is prepared to accept the deviation from Howard's Conan, the story keeps your interest throughout (which is my personal way of determining the worthiness of ANY flick). Sixth, Sandahl Bergman is super sharp and sexy; she possesses a certain barbaric beauty essential to the role and it's hard not to gaze at her shapely form in utter awe when she's on screen. Lastly, the overall tone of the film is quite serious and brooding; despite Valeria's initial campy sequence mentioned above and a couple of amusing scenes with Mako, the film eludes the rut of camp (unfortunately the sequel cannot boast of this quality).

SPECIAL MOMENTS AND INTERESTING ITEMS:
- The love scene between Conan & Valeria and, later, the death/funeral pyre scenes are truly moving, reverent and beautiful. The accompanying music is emotionally potent.
- Conan's spiritual evolution in regards to sexuality and love is interesting: His first exposure is as a slave when beautiful women are occasionally thrown to him for the amusement of those watching. After he acquires his freedom his first and only experience with casual sex goes horribly wrong. Later in Zamora he dismisses the solicitations of prostitutes with a wave and a derogatory word. Finally he meets Valeria and discovers true love and commitment, conveyed well in the love/death/funeral scenes noted above.
- Both the battles inside the mountain fortress and, later, the showdown at the mounds are truly thrilling. The score during these sequences really gets your blood pumping.
- Right before the battle at the mounds Conan and Subotai brace themselves as the 'riders of doom' trot forth. You can see the bold determination on their faces: They have no other recourse; they will stand and fight as men, come what may. (All men will eventually have to stand and fight in this manner one way or another, and we wuss out at our own peril).
- After their unlikely victory Conan raises his arms (and weapons) in salute to the altar where Valeria was cremated. It gives you goosebumps.

Both ""The Complete Quest"" and ""Collector's Edition"" contain an excellent 55-minute ""Making Of"" documentary wherein all of the principle actors and creators are interviewed, as well as an excellent commentary by Milius and Schwarzenegger.

CONAN THE DESTROYER is featured on Side Two. In a way it's more faithful to Robert E. Howard thanks to comic writers Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway, and it's highlighted by another great score by Basil Poledouris and various beauties; unfortunately it's horribly marred by a cartoonish and campy air. It's okay with some flashes of goodness; that's about it (Rating: 3/5 Stars or ""C+"").

FINAL ANALYSIS: Like I said, I've finally come to see the magnificence of ""Conan the Barbarian,"" but I had to get over my hang ups concerning the deviations from Howard's Conan to see it. As an ALTERNATIVE Conan it's a masterpiece of cinematic art.

It has great, memorable characters, a really good story of love and vengence and ofcourse at the end, justice always prevails. As for Conan the Destroyer, i must say that it is alot better than it gets credit for in other reviews. While it is slightly toned down, the PG rating didn't hurt it much as there is still plenty of violence and blood throughout and right from the start. The story is not quite as good and more sci fish but its still a decent story and at the end of the day you just want to watch Conan destroy enemies which he does plenty of. And the end leaves it open for a sequel although one has not been made to date. Hopefully that will happen soon though. All in all, The destroyer isn't quite as good as the first one but its still pretty good. You have to keep in mind that Conan the Barbarian is so bad a** that its impossible to make a sequel better than it. Buy this DVD. You won't regret it.",1250294400,,1060,4.125603864734299
1950670,2,B0000VD12I,"Everyone hates it when the guy or gal who's read the book, critiques. There's good reason to cringe because we all know that the books can't be the movies, right?
In this case, however, there was no attempt to incorporate the stories into film. Simply stated, this film comes nowhere near the writer's character.

Never was Conan a slave.
He was not a pit fighter (what's with this psuedo machismo attraction to dirty, bloody arenas anyway?).
He did not learn to fight by way of Eastern sword arts or quote Eastern pilosophy.
Never was he a lout. Conan had a clear, sharp mind even if he was known to drink to excess and womanize.
He did not quote any philosophers but it's easy to see that eventually they would quote him.

The character that Robert Howard created was complex, he was an enigma.
No offense to Arnold but as the muscled man in the film who grunted and waxed poetically of killing with his heavy accent he could not be the man Robert Howard wrote about. Not the way it was written, directed and performed.
That's not Arnold Schwarzeneggar's fault. It's not art directors and cinematographers, or the guy who did the great musical score's fault.
The fault lies with the writers who ignored Robert Howard other than to loot some of his lines. The rest falls squarely on the shoulders of an otherwise decent pair of directors who had no idea who the character was or what he did. And they made no attempt to remedy their ignorance. I was not looking for a strict adaptation of any of the stories because Hollywood is incapable of taking the simplest ideas on face vaue.
This was a vanity project for John Millius and a paycheck for Richard Fleisher. They set out to make entertaining films and could not have cared less about the source material much less the epic they missed by ignoring that source.
The story in CTB has no real plot besides a spaghetti western style revenge story. Arnold is miscast to the point of almost being ludicrous in scenes where he grunts and squeals like a piggy (the scene where he falls in the crypt to retrieve a sword, on the run from wolves), or cries at the feet of his tormentors and Thulsa Doom because Doom killed his parents (most un-Conan-like) and all the endless posing with a sword was just terrible.
Sandahl Bergman playing Valeria (horrible dialogue and all) is much closer to the actual Conan than Arnold's character was allowed to be.
Why does everyone in CTB speak in pronouncements?
James Earl Jones is perhaps the most dissapointing. Why has no one mentioned his channelling of Darth Vader (he voiced Darth Vader in the Star Wars films)? That actually was ludicrous. Mako was very entertaining as Conan's wise man in his entourage.
Conan the Barbarian might just as well have been a satire of the sword and sorcery genre. Very little would have to be changed to make that happen..
Conan the Destroyer is like a movie length version of something that could have been culled directly from the comic book series of the time (oddly enough the comic book adaptations are superior to the films). In that it's actually more entertaining because it takes itself so much less seriously than the first film. The rubber monster in the climactic scene is the clincher.
Please don't assume that because Conan's not the CTB film that I'm ignoring a great film. This is in no way great even if the lead was named ""Frank"" and he came from Chimeria.
This film doesn't hold up against better sword & sorcery type fantasy films like Dragonslayer and Excaliber. Both of which predated Conan the Barbarian by about a year.
There were also worse films. Many of them.
The expectation of this film is, honestly, part of it's problem. Conan has survived in print for decades. There's a reason Robert Howard's work remains in print (even as marketing forces during this period kept most of his Conan work at bay or married to pastiche in order to see print).

I can't resent people for liking the first or both films. Everything is measured in personal taste.
Besides, at the time Conan pastiche was easier to access than the original stories. For a lot of people (who read those inferior attempts at writing Conan's tales) they see the film as superior to those weak efforts in prose. Unfortunately that's not high praise. The fact is CTB was marketed as something unique and the marketing people were good because that's become the truth in spite of the facts proving otherwise for anyone who really wants to look. There's also no doubt that readers of Robert Howard's stories were not exactly vast in number. It's easy to quash a small opinion when there's no outlet for that opinion to be expressed. That's what marketing agencies are for- to keep other opinions from being heard. I remember at the time that not one reviewer even made reference to Conan other than the current comic books.

I do resent the industry for wittling down what could have been a timeless epic into this drab but muscular effort.
It's too bad the art directors were not THE directors. Ron Cobb and Bill Stout had a much better grasp of the character.
Finally, I want to address something that's been mentioned about the lacking of sorcerous elements. Actually, this is one area where there was little room for improvement. Those elements of sorcery in Howard's tales are just the spice of the story. The point is, there are no fairies, gnomes or dragons strolling through the market places of the Hyborian age.",1247097600,3,5430,4.670846394984326

Also, the understanding of ancient legend and its thematics here is masterful. Whoever made this film understood the dilemma of ancient man, so well portrayed here in so many ways. A mythopoeic synthesis of post-diluvian man involving the iron age cultic struggle against the heroic tradition is executed with monumental genius. The themes of spirit vs flesh are symbolized by the riddle of steel and are embodied in the heroic underworld journey in archetypal combat mythos without losing any background realism. One could almost step into this world. It truly represents the epic soul and has been grossly miscomprehended, on the one hand, by unlearned scoffers who cannot read the symbolic subtext, and on the otherhand by zealous followers of Conan comics who want Howard's version. This film version outstrips Howard's shallow character by far.

I gave only four stars because Conan the Destroyer truly sucks and should be avoided. It should not be watched because it will spoil the experience. Also, I was VERY UPSET about the inclusion of scenes that were cut in the original version. These scenes focus on minor dialogue and characters and weaken the story's climactic ending.

1950742,3,B0000VD12I,"Violent and entertaining, both films are, in the end, a real disappointment to anyone who is actually familiar with the 21 Conan stories of Robert E. Howard -- and I don't mean via Marvel Comics.  I mean those original tales that predominately appeared between 1933 and 1936. (A few that were found after Howard's death appeared in the 1950's in various sf & fantasy magazines.)  Published in the legendary WEIRD TALES magazine at a time when that publication also featured the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, Robert Bloch and so many others. Conan's character is best summed up by the scene in ""Phoenix On the Sword"" where King Conan is attacked in his bedchamber by assasins.  With one hand against the wall behind him and a battle axe in the other, he says to his attackers through bruised and bloody lips, ""Who dies first?""  In all the interviews I have ever seen of John Milius about Howard and Conan -- including the features and commentary on CONAN THE BARBARIAN -- one important thing is blatantly apparent: he never understood Howard or Conan.  He wanted to make a barbarian picture and this was the vehicle.  In the process he takes bits and set pieces from several different Conan stories and you get this goofy amalgamation that distorts the Conan legend.  One nice touch though, William Smith as Conan's dad.  Had this project been a decade earlier he would have been perfect as Conan.  As for CONAN THE DESTROYER, this one depicts a Conan closer to Howard's vision of a super barbarian, it plays for laughs to an ungodly degree and ultimately comes off as cheesy.  Schwarzenegger as Conan ... not bad but Bill Smith would have been better.  I am cautiously hopeful that Lionsgate will launch a series on the character that Howard would be happy with.  I was relieved when Milius involvement ended some years ago.  He got it wrong over a quarter of a century ago, why should anyone think he'd be better now?  An interesting oversight: no where in CTB is Sandahl Bergman's character ever called ""Valeria"" by name! Maybe something ended up on the cutting room floor.  Originally Milius casting vision (Schwarzenegger was associated for the project since 1977 when Edward Pressman acquired the rights) had been Sean Connery as Thulsa Doom (who is actually a character out of one of REH's King Kull of Atlantis stories), Raquel Welch as Valeria and Lou Ferrigno as one of Doom's henchman -- most probably the role played by former Oakland Raider Ben Davidson.  Mako's role would have gone to John Huston. A pity.  Now what do I like about this movie you ask? Great score by the late Basil Pouldouris.  The battle on the mounds between Conan, Subotai (surfer Jerry Lopez), Rexor (Davidson) and Thorgrim (Scandanivian weight lifter and karate champion Sven Ole Thorson). On a different note William Smith has said in interviews over the years that after he beat Arnold in arm wrestling he was never again asked to be in a Schwarzenegger movie! (Little did Arnie know that along with being a film biker, bare-knuckle brawler, and various crazed over the edge psychos, Smith was also a body builder, Gold Glove champion while in the Air Force and two-time arm wrestling champion.)*** UPDATE/30jan2010:  Lionsgate's Marc Nispel directed new take on the Howard character launches in mid-March with STARGATE ATLANTIS alum Jason Momoa as the new Conan!

* James Earl Jones is fantastic as the understatedly evil Falsa Doom
* ""Arni"" is the perfect Conan...buff, brusk, and focused
* The cinematography is just outstanding
* Great music score
* Not for kids (for reasons listed above)

This is a very good action movie and is highly recommended for fans of the Sword & Sorcery genre.

""Conan the Destroyer"", this disappointing sequel to the entertaining and well made ""Conan the Barbarian"" is an example of what happens when studios attempt to broaden the appeal of a movie for younger audiences. This movie tries to inject more slapstick humor and includes ""big name"" stars (Grace Jones and Wilt Chamberlain), while sacrificing much of the story line, effective characters, and raw action that made the first movie so watchable.

That's probably why I don't write many reviews; however I must throw in my two cents regarding ""Conan - The Complete Quest"". There are several complaints here about it being double-sided and/or the fact that Conan The Destroyer is included. Before I go any further, let me just say that I've watched CtB, but have not watched CtD yet. From what I read, it's not very impressive. But that's OK because CtB is...it's easily a five star fantasy/action flick. By the way, this set includes the Collector's Edition of CtB, so it's got the best version currently available (with a few extras and a cleaned up picture). That being said, why complain when this set costs the same as CtB by itself? They're both at bargain-bin prices, and this is the better deal, yet it has a few moronic reviews which brings the rating down. If you must, just think of CtD as a really cool bonus feature. And the fact that it's a double sided disc is nothing to whine about. As long as it plays fine, that's all that matters. Touch the disc by the edges (like you should be doing with all DVDs) and you won't have to worry about smudges. If you already own both movies then obviously this set isn't worth your money, but if you have neither then this is the cheapest/smartest way to own the ""Complete Quest"".",1207353600,10,1410,4.490272373540856

1950746,4,B0000VD12I,"Arnold Schwarenegger was always larger than life for me.  He was a man who could do and say anything, climb the highest mountains, fight the demons, have good triumph over evil, and become king.  Not just in the movies, but in real life (winning a Mr. Universe title, become an action movie star, marry into the Kennedy family, and later become governor of California).  This was the movie that shot him into the stratosphere, where he's more or less been ever since.

In a time between the fall of Atlantis and the rise of modern civilization is when this (as just about all) fantasy film begins.  Conan would be taken as a slave from a simple farming town as a boy, imprisoned for years, then become a powerful warrior who would avenge James Earl Jones for murdering his family.  Arnold was brand new, and he was pumped to perfection having just won a Mr. Universe title.  Couple that in with special effects, watching him run around in loin clothes, action and revenge type storyline, and he rode this hit to fame and fortune.

The sequal, Conan the Destroyer, however, left audiences a little lacking.  I think they were disappointed with the campy humor put into the second one deliberatly.  The addition of Alec the bumbling fool / comic foil, Grace Jones with her shemale warrior freaky, and Wilt Chamberlin was funny, in an odd sort of way.  If anything I thought this movie ebbed and flowed a lot better than the first one, as I found the first to be dull and boring in several places.

Although both CTB and CTD do not follow Robert E. Howard's stories very well, they are good in their own right. However, Conan the Barbarian has the luster of a diamond when compared with Conan the Destroyer. The first was created to play like an epic Wagner opera, with a great soundtrack by Basil Poledouris set against the story. Arnold's accent only enhanced his capabilities to play Conan, making him perfect for the role. Conan's quest to avenge the deaths of his parents leads him through love, loss, magic, and mystery as he traverses Hyboria. Conan The Barbarian was obviously unintended for young viewer's eyes, as blood and gore are abound in the first movie, amongst other things... This however, is where The Destroyer differs.

Conan The Destroyer was unfortunately dumbed down from it's predecessor to a hack and slash adventure that fell into the B' movie category. It has it's moments, and luckily Poledoris returned to do the score for the movie. But it didn't hold the magic that the first had.

Nowhere on this DVD will you find the original ending in the DVD extras, etc., but I do want to say that this ending is not much different from the original, so if you have not seen the original ending, you will not be missing much at all.  It also has an additional scene with Subotai and Conan dialoging.  That's all that I remember being different from the original version.  As for Conan the Destroyer, I don't recall any difference.

FOR THOSE WHO ARE NEW TO THE CONAN CHARACTER:

Conan is the barbarian/warrior character created by writer Robert E. Howard (1906-1936).  His stories take place in the Hyborian Age (a mystical age between the sinking of Atlantis and the beginning of civilization, which was created by Howard as well).  Much of the Conan artwork was painted by artist Frank Frazetta (1928-), which is probably Frazetta's better-known work.

John Milus' own liberal interpretation found on his Director's Commentary of Conan the Barbarian says how he thinks Howard created the Conan character and the warrior's many tales, that he conjured in his mind, a dead warrior king bearing an axe, and soon felt as if his character actually oppressed his very thoughts, forcing him to tell the tales of Conan, a king long forgotten by mankind and that he feared that if he did not write as the warrior commanded, the warrior king would strike him down with his axe.

The real story on how Howard came up with the character can be found on The Official Robert E. Howard Website at  [...], where they quote Glenn Lord's The Last Celt: A Bio-Bibliography of Robert Ervin Howard

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Celt-A-Bio-Bibliography-of-Robert-Ervin-Howard/dp/9997546628/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Celt: A Bio-Bibliography of Robert Ervin Howard</a>

FOR THOSE WHO ARE NEW TO THE CONAN MOVIES:

Only two movies have been made up till now on Howard's character, Conan the Barbarian (1982) and Conan the Destroyer (1984).  Most people (as I am) are fans of the first, and not the second, though the second was entertaining in its on ways.

No joke, Conan the Barbarian is my All-Time favorite movie.  I first saw this film when I was young, and remember that back in those days this movie was ""the movie to see"", with its action packed storyline, wonderful cinematography, and its beautifully composed musical score.  Not to mention, starring Mr. Olympia himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who starred in both films.  Conan was Arnold's first big-time role after winning his last Mr. Olympia in 1980, so Arnold was still gee-golly-huge and ideal for the part.  Nevertheless, this first movie also starred renowned actor, James Earl Jones, who plays the very charismatic cult leader, Thulsa Doom, and with a voice like his, who can deny that he's the perfect fit for that role.

Oliver Stone (a fan of the Conan novels) co-wrote the first screenplay of Conan the Barbarian.  He actually had an entire screenplay for the movie, which was quickly bought out by producer Dino DeLaurentis and modified by writer/director, John Milius, who also co-wrote and directed Red Dawn.  John envisioned on making Conan a trilogy, while assistant producer, Edward Summer, intended the Conan films to be a huge series, much like the 007 series.  Either of which would have been nice for us fans, but neither person played any part in the creation of our only sequel.  Instead, two writers from Marvel Comics were brought onboard, Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway, who wrote the initial screenplay for the sequel, which was drastically changed by writer Stanley Mann.  Director Richard Fleischer, who also directed Tora! Tora! Tora! in 1970 and Red Sonja in 1985, directed Conan the Destroyer.  I think the only thing the two movies shared in common were Arnold and producer Dino DeLaurentis; this is why you find extreme differences between the two finished works.

On another note, many celebrities co-stared in these movies, like NBA star Wilt Chamberlain, and model Grace Jones.  But one person out of the rest, whom I would like to point out, is Hawaiian Gerry Lopez, who plays Subotai in the first film.  Gerry is actually a world-renowned champion surfer, and from an early age in his life, he read many of the Conan novels.  With Gerry's features and his great appreciation of Howard's work, it was difficult for old friend John Milius to find anyone else as a better fit for the role of Subotai.  Gerry Lopez also co-stars in Big Wednesday (another work of John Milius) and North Shore, which are both classic surfer movies, next to the Endless Summer films.

MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE CONAN DIALOG:

To bring you up to speed, early on in the movie Conan was enslaved and bought to be a Pit Fighter.  After countless victories, his master takes him to the Far East for breeding (yes, I said breeding). As a reward for his success, Conan was given an education in eastern philosophies and was taught the art of swordsmanship from the eastern masters.

And so, in the next scene you see some sort of general talking to his men.  He says to them,  ""We have won again. That is good! But what is best in life?""

One of his men replies, ""The open steppe, fleet horse, falcon on your wrist, wind in your hair!""

""Wrong!"" replies the general, and then asks, ""Conan, what is best in life?""

Which Conan replies, ""To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women!""

... that's just wicked man.

1950789,5,B0000VD12I,"In Conan the Barbarian, while Conan is not entirely presented the way Howard wrote him, the film is nonetheless well done and extremely entertaining. The points of straying from Howard are many--the appearance of other Cimmerians besides Conan in the story, the prefiguration of Conan's kingship (a plot device taken from L Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter's apocryphal entries into the series, and Conan praying, along with scenes taken from other Howard creations besides Conan--though for the most part, the movie actually tracks Howard's vision fairly closely. Of course the movie opens with Nietzsche's most famous quote and the plot turns Conan into a Nietzschean superman capable of overcoming appalling odds even though he is only a man and not a superhero. James Earl Jones gives great support as the Jim Jones-like cult leader Thulsa Doom (actually a villain out of Howard's Kull series), while Ben Davidson, Sven Ole Thorsen, Mako, Gerry Lopez, and Sandahl Bergman all serve effectively variously as friends and enemies. Late in the movie, Conan suffers in a way cleverly reminiscent of Howard's original creation then goes on to a swashbuckling finale and climax against Doom's followers. The end of the film--in keeping with the tone of the film a combination of Howard and Nietzsche--is very satisfying and beautifully done. While the sequel is much lesser and deserves no in-depth mention here, the first Conan movie is a fine entry into the sword-and-sorcery genre and should be more highly regarded both in its genre and among movies in general.",1136246400,46,1560,5.145669291338582
1950790,5,B0000VD12I,"The opening scene is incredible.

Thulsa Doom, the villain from Conan the Barbarian is insanely evil.  In the opening scene, after the entire village is slaughtered, Doom has the young Conan and his super-hot, leather-clad, sword-wielding, mom cornered.  Doom dismounts from his horse and is handed the sword of Conan's just-slain father.  He examines it with obvious appreciation and then turns to face Conan and his mother.  NOT A WORD IS SAID IN THIS ENTIRE SCENE!  Any movie made today would be falling all over itself to put in some cheesy one-liner that they could reference later in the movie to help show how this event molded Conan's life.  ok, sorry for the rant, Doom begins to stare with his hypnotic blue eyes and turns slowly away as Conan's mother stands paralyzed, sword hanging useless at her side.

Then, out of nowhere, Doom spins quickly and lops off the womans head!  The sound effect for this decapitation is disgustingly effective.  I have no idea how accurate it is, but it seems like they got the sound exactly right.  You see her head fall and her body collapse to the side, pulling her hand out of Conan's.  He simply looks at his now empty hand, then up at Doom.  With still no words spoken you understand that Conan is going to spend the rest of his life in pursuit of Thulsa Doom.

This movie is fantastic!  The production value is of the highest quality and every aspect of the story and characters is treated with total respect.  There are no cheesy one-liners, no cheap laughs or gags.  The costumes look as realistic as you could want, but with beautifully designed fantasy elements.

A lot of the stuff from the book have been left out (Conan fighting skeleton, monsters, etc.) but there are still lots of fantasy elements.  The witch woman that Conan encounters and the giant snake raised by Thorgrimm are great additions.

This may be one of the greatest movies of all time.  If you consider how closely and accurately the movie portrays the character of Conan and his savage world, I think you will agree that this movie succeeds more than most others.

If you like Fantasy, James Earl Jones, and Animation here is a great recommendation:  The Flight of Dragons.  It's primarily a movie for younger audiences, but Mr. Jones plays a character more evil than Thulsa Doom and Darth Vader! Seriously.  The movie is about four wizards and how their realm of magic is being lost to the world of logic and science.  Jones plays Omadon, the Red Wizard (long O sound).  You will see just how evil he can be when he lays out his plans for the world to the other three wizards. Truly a scary scene when you take a look around and see the evil spreading in the world today.",1127952000,8,2699,4.60377358490566
1950791,5,B0000VD12I,This dvd is absoletly neccesary in a good home dvd collection.,1127347200,2,62,4.7272727272727275
1950812,4,B0000VD12I,"""Know, O Prince, that between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of the rise of the sons of Aryas, there was an age undreamed of...Hither came Conan the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandled feet.""

At least, that was what was written in ""The Nemedian Chronicles,"" the faux ancient text referred to by Robert E. Howard in his stories about Conan the Barbarian. Conan had been a pulp fiction hero in the 1930s and the stories had been republished in the 1960s in paperbacks with great covers by artist Frank Frazetta, with some unfinished stories by Howard completed by L. Sprague De Camp, and Lin Carter, who also wrote some adventures to fill in the gaps in the Conan chronology. Then Marvel comics launched a comic book version, scripted by Roy Thomas and drawn by Barry Smith, with many of the stories being adapted from Howard's original stories about Conan and other sword and sorcery adventurers.

It was with that literary lineage in the realm of sword and sorcery that ""Conan the Barbarian"" was released in 1982, although it ended up doing more for Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting career than it did for the character he was playing, since the film spawned only a single, vastly inferior sequel, ""Conan the Destroyer."" Director John Milius covers the early years of Conan's career, when he was taken from his home in Cimmeria as a boy by a raiding party of Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones), and sold into slavery. Eventually he began a trained gladiator and eventually earned his freedom, where he became a thief. The script by Milius and Oliver Stone essentially created a new narrative for the film, although readers of Conan will recognize scenes and elements from to ""The Thing in the Crypt"", ""The Elephant Tower"", ""Red Nails,"" ""Queen of the Black Coast"", ""The Mirrors of Tuzun Thune,"" and ""A Witch Shall Be Born.""

Schwarzenegger's acting experience was rather limited at that point, but the role essentially required him to flex his muscles and look good. The showcase sequence of the film is when Conan and his companions, Valeria (Sandhal Bergman) and Subotai (Gerry Lopez), sneak into the stronghold of Thulsa Doom to rescue the daughter of King Osric (Max Von Sydow), who has joined the Snake Cult. With some pretty good background music by composer Basil Poledouris, the trio of thieves set up a diversion and launch a quick attack. There is a moment when Conan, his body painted with black stripes as camouflage, gets into position to begin a sword fight that simply looks great. The actual swordplay is rather limited, more slashing that actual swording, but we do get a sense of the power of Conan.

James Earl Jones seems a bit distant as the villain, but he was engaged in a weird acting experiment where Milius told him exactly how to do line readings and he did it. In the end, it is Sandahl Bergman who surprisingly provides what little emotional impact the film exhibits. A trained dancer, Bergman's elegant and fluid movements contrast nicely with Schwarzenegger's raw power, and she has a great way of looking at him that makes it clear which one of them has the brains in this outfit. More importantly, Bergman's Valerie seems totally at home in the savage world that the film creates.

""Conan the Barbarian"" is not a great film, although it is arguably remains the best sword & sorcery film made to date (granted, the competition for the honor is rather sparse). Despite the overall woodenness of the acting, it does have the virtue of taking its characters seriously without descending into camp (they wait for the sequel to do that). If anything this film is reluctance to find any humor in the story (although Conan does slug a camel in an apparent homage to ""Blazing Saddles""), which helps keep this 1982 film on the high road, relatively speaking. Consequently, while Conan fans might have hoped for something better, they certainly had ample reason to expect something much worse, and thus were relatively overjoyed by the end product.

That is not the case with ""Conan the Destroyer,"" where the story was by Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway, a pair of writers for Marvel Comics. The story is a basic quest story where Conan escorts a virgin princess to bring back a powerful gem from a crystal palace, which will then be returned to a queen (Sarah Douglas), who turns out to be evil and wants to sacrifice the princess so the gem can used to summon an ancient demon, at which point wackiness will ensue.

The problem is not in the story, which certainly allows you to string together a series of Sword & Sorcery adventures, but in the casting. The princess is played by Olivia d'Abo, who simply looks too young (i.e., Conan was forever leaving pregnant princesses behind in his various adventures but there is no chance for that sort of chemistry here). Her body guard, Bombaata, is played by basketball Hall of Famer, Wilt Chamberlain, while Zula, the warrior woman who joins the group is played by Grace Jones, the singer/dancer/model/crazy woman. Comic relif, which was relatively absent in the orignal film, is provided by Tracey Walter as Malak.

With such casting the descent into camp becomes inevitable. Besides, there is nothing in this film even close to rivaling Arnold's best moments in the original (especially since the final shot of the old King Conan is recycled from the first film). ""Conan the Destroyer"" pretty much killed the franchise when it came out in 1984, although Milius is apparently preparing a 2005 film ""King Conan: Crown of Iron,"" which there being a lot of speculation as to who will play Conan now that Arnold is Governor of Cal-e-fornia.

Those who have actually read the originally Conan stories will also find it rather distressing that Toth-Amon, the great Stygian wizard who was Conan's biggest enemy in the Howard stories, is reduced to a pit stop on this quest (I remember thinking at the time that this was the equivalent of Darth Vader being one of the guys that got dispatched at the Cantina in ""Star Wars""). Thomas and Conway were upset by Stanley Mann's final screenplay, as well as the finished film, and ended up turning their story into the graphic novel ""Conan and the Horn of Azoth,"" with art by Mike Docherty (all the names got changed to avoid any confusion).",1116547200,14,6439,4.804151624548736
1950813,3,B0000VD12I,"The movie content is fine if you're a Conan fan. If you buy this DVD, read my advice here. On side one (Conan the Barbarian side) there is a defect in track 13. My first copy froze up totally on this defect spot. Amazon's replacement had a slight pause in the exact same place. So if you buy this go directly to scene 13 on side one to be sure the copy you bought plays OK. If anyone knows how to pass this defect info onto Amazon, be my guest. The movie Conan the Barbarian also has a different ending compaired to the movie I saw in theaters long time ago. The different ending is OK I guess. Just the added content didn't add to or take away from this picture. I actually liked the original ending better myself.",1116028800,28,715,4.151079136690647
1950814,4,B0000VD12I,"Governor Schwarzenegger may be better known for his ""Terminator"" films but I feel that his first big-budgetted role in ""Conan the Barbarian"" is the film that ranks as one of his best.  Directed by John Milius, the movie is a blend of rousing adventure, adult situations, a brilliant Basil Poledouris score, exquisite cinematography for its exotic locations, stunning set pieces and costuming, and not-bad-acting from a former body builder.  Though he didn't sport a lot of dialogue, Schwarzenegger did make the most of his limited vocals with revealing facial expression, along with the required muscle flexing and heroics, as needed to portray Robert E. Howard's legendary hero.  With an international cast that features Max Von Sydow, Mako, and the stunning Sandahl Bergman as Conan's romantic interest Valeria, it's no wonder that the film was a worldwide hit.

However, James Earl Jones must have had the most fun, assaying the role of villain ""Thulsa Doom,"" sporting a long wig, menacing eyes, and over-the-top renditions of his lines and mannerisms as the ultimate ""religious leader/sorcerer"".

The film probably garnered an R-rating because of the well-choreographed violence scenes and a brief but highly erotic sexual romp between Conan and Valeria.

This is the more adult of the two film, fit for older and more mature viewers.

The aforementioned factors may have led the producers to water down the tone and situations in the sequel ""Conan the Destroyer.""  The PG-rated film features Arnold and Mako returning in their roles from the first, but they are joined by basketball legend Wilt Chamberlain, disco diva Grace Jones, perennial sidekick Tracy Walter, and favored villainous Sarah Douglas.

Directed this time by Richard Fleischer ""Conan the Destroyer"" has a modicum of bloodshed (in comparison to the first film) and Grace Jones's character, though scantily clad, is too adrogynous to pose a ""threat"" to members of either gender, and can easily be viewed by a younger audience which is this film's target.

The first film gets five stars for its pluses, wherein the second one gets three and a half.

A warning for purchasers: One might wonder what director Milius was ""on"" when he and Arnold added their commentary, available only for the first film.  The director sounds really ""out there"" in his ramblings.",1115424000,4,2328,5.1786666666666665
1950815,5,B0000VD12I,"Many people don't seem to liek the sequel, but for me it was even better, a little faster paced, more action and Conan is still the Arnold strong man we know and love.

the first movie is for sure a classic, but has a slightly different pace and tone, but it is one of Arnolds best, and both these movies have ruined conan forever more..because no one but Arnold can be conan for me, a few have tried, but he did it best.

the extras are all for the first movie, a shame since an uncut version of the sequel would be great, but at least it's not all bare bones.

The special features are good. But as someone else mentioned here, the Arnold/Milius commentary is a hidden gem. I actually watched the barbarian a few times on this DVD before I got around to watching it with the commentary from these two. If there was a rating system for commentaries, the barabarian commentary from Arnold/Milius would be five stars all the way. Perhaps the best audio commentary I've ever heard on a DVD barring Glory. It is very witty, downright hilarious at times and kind of frightening how the discussion between the two leaves little doubt that they are both verrrrrrrrrry conservative politically and perhaps philosophically. Wagner, Nietzche, Reifenstahl... What's next? I was surprised at the lengths at which Milius unapologetically waxed nastalgically about his influences who include several early 20th century german directors, including Reifenstahl [Sp?]. But it is what it is. Arnold skillfully avoided mentioning anything german directly, although he did acknowledge Nieitzcheian perspectives several times. And Arnold was so funny. At the point where a snake-cult maiden is eating a human hand, Arnold said, ""John [Milius], you're sick. But that's funny.""

The two go on to spew a few well-spun yarns as well particularly about Arnold having to bite the neck of a vulture. I think the two were clearly telling their stories with tongues firmly planted in cheeks and winks exchanged off camera. It's a whole new experience to watching this film. Forever macho, don't expect any political correctness or softy sensative viewpoints. But nonetheless very entertaining and provides a good laugh... several times.",1109894400,8,1862,5.308474576271187
