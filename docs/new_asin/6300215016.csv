7806120,5,6300215016,"I saw this ""back in the day"" when it was new....left it with my ""Ex"" along with every material thing we had accumulated over 14 years together since I knew I would be able to afford to buy anything I wanted within a short period of freedom and she would likely always be poor........although I think she may now have a control-freak/leech of a husband that keeps her finances in line......he won't even let her answer the phone let alone touch any of their money......and she makes plenty of money for the both of them since I supported her through school and helped get her into a good paying job.......anyway, this Gallagher is so good I had to have it again!!!  :o)  Would go well with National Lampoon's ""Class of 86""",1296518400,,721,4.4961832061068705
