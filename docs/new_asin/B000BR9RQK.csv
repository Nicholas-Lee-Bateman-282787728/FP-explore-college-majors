2438362,3,B000BR9RQK,"Gal Morel (Wild Reeds, Under Another Sky, Full Speed) seems to continue to test cinematic minefields and while not every film is a success, they each indicate that there is a reservoir of talent in this writer/actor/director that will eventually galvanize into to a significant voice. This much maligned little tale 'Le Clan' (oddly but in the end appropriately titled in English 'Three Dancing Slaves') has more going for it than most audiences acknowledge: for all its weakness there are some very sensitive moments about father/son relationships, filial love, romantic love, racism, bigotry, and the ever-growing dysfunctional family problem.

Three brothers live with their recently widowed father in a small town near the Alps in France.  Marc (Nicolas Cazal&eacute;) is a rebellious youth, into drugs and petty crime and at constant contention with his overbearing father (Bruno Lochet); Christophe (St&eacute;phane Rideau) is recently released from prison and is trying to live straight by starting from the bottom in a pork factory and working his way to the top; Olivier (Thomas Dumerchez) is the youngest and though tattooed and quasi-rebellious is the sensitive one whose gender issues are just beginning to focus.  The film is told in three versions, one by each brother, and from these segments we paste together a family disrupted and needy.  Marc fights and performs dangerous deeds, Christophe struggles to re-create his broken life, and Olivier finds love and passion with Hicham (Salim Kechiouche), Marc's friend, who is North African and repeatedly dances the capoeira, a slave dance, for his own expression and his need to connect with Olivier.  Despite the differences in these young men there are repeated encounters that signify their bonding.  One quiet scene shows the father awake, sitting and watching the troubled sons asleep, naked, entwined in each other's bodies: it should be clipped for a still shot as it is very beautiful.

There really is little resolution of an overall story; these three short stories simply end in their own fashion and the interlocking meaning is left to the viewer. Each brother is a 'slave' in his own manner. Yes, there are moments of violence, a pitiful animal abuse scene, and gaps in dialogue that bump the film around in a clumsy fashion, but look for the little moments of visual beauty and the movie takes on different meaning.

2438363,1,B000BR9RQK,"Without trying to give the plot away, let's just admit it: whenever you have any pet or animal in a film, unless it's humane society animal-doting USA film, something very BAD is going to happen.  Out of the three brothers in this film, the middle character has a pet dog.  Enough said.  Our of a boring first 30 minutes of slogging thru this film, I kept my eye on the dog.  After the first 30 minutes we're in with the eldest brother out of prison, played by Stephane Rideau, as it is now his chapter.  Rideau is a blank-stared waste of space here, unfortunate as he's usually the reliable dramatic/quirky/sexy one in other films, I guess the french don't know what to do with him, as he is generally fearless as an actor (even when he is staring into space, there's usually something more intense about it in other films). You think with Rideau in the film SOMETHING has to happen with this guy, but nothing does.  Like all the drama belongs to borderline gang member, brother #2 who shaves his head and entire body, in fact.  Brother #1 just wants to keep his head low and stay out of trouble; still, the career path skyward he takes, leaping over several union employees with seniority to become top dog at the plant, is bordering on fantasy.  btw Is Rideau aging badly or is it just a bad haircut?  As for brother #3 who is rather puppy-in-tow but also obviously the 'delicate, quite, sensitive' of the brothers, you already know what's going on with him before you get to the final segment which is devoted to his personal story, and his relationship with a young arab who loves him, so there's no real surprise, and I'm not sure there's meant to be, as this screenplay is crowded with cliches, including the sensitive youngest brother who still tells his dead mother everything going on in the family, and the eldest who aspires to be a patriarch and is disappointed with his lame father's lack of control over his family.  Why the elder brothers sleep together nude wrapped around each other, is the real mystery and never addressed, as they don't appear to have an incestuous relationship, so we're meant to enjoy the tangle of well-muscled limbs and the visual is only about that.  If you're looking to buy the film for sexual and or nudity content I would advise there's not enough of either to make it worth your while.  There might be some intense aggro for male viewers enjoying films where men are nasty to each other, emotionally and physically, and hence some sort of bonding is implied.",1136764800,7,2505,4.5794183445190155
2438364,5,B000BR9RQK,"I agree 100% with the editorial review written by Amazon. The film is beautifully crafted, compelling story line about family dynamics involving the three brothers-all Arabs. Also, the film is culturally sensitive, superbly acted, and lushly photographed.

In my opinion, this isn't a gay film. Granted there are some homoerotic events; however, they are all integral to the story line. Plus this is French cinema at its best.",1135987200,13,426,5.264705882352941
2438365,1,B000BR9RQK,"I saw this movie at the Tampa International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in 2005.  It was the WORST movie of the Festival -- even most of the Board of Directors thought so.  It somehow slipped through the cracks.  One of my friends, who is Italian by birth and speaks French fluently, was so turned off by the movie that he refused to come to the Festival for the next night's foreign film.  THAT movie, Cote d'Azur, was excellent.

But back to Three Dancing Slaves - ugh, yuck and no thanks!  Senseless, violent content and not a gay movie at all.",1135814400,3,549,4.3861386138613865
2438366,2,B000BR9RQK,"i have a feeling this was a really good movie.  borders and amazon need to state the fact CLEARLY when a movie is in a foreign language.  this movie was in french.  now i have no problem in the movie houses reading english at the bottom but in this case, it was rough.  i have no clue what the story line was about since i was so busy reading the english.  if a story is in a language other than english, all it would take is that fact.  FRENCH w/ENGLISH SUBTITLES WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT, but no one does that.  i also would like to contact a human at borders but evidently they are just too busy to talk with a customer.  i have about 400 movies, most of them from borders/amazon so i consider myself a good customer.  all i ask is a ""contact us button""  but evidently no chance of that.  i don't suppose this will reach the review site because of all this but what does one do except just quitting of ordering all these movies from a company that just doesn't care about the buyers.

2438367,3,B000BR9RQK,"First of all, I did enjoy the movie, if I understood French perhaps I would have enjoyed even more; I would not let that be a deterrent as I have watched many wonderfully written and directed foreign movies. Gradually the movie begins to reveal to the viewer the more personal and deep personalities of the characters and manages to keep you entertained; the ending was a surprise.",1405555200,,381,4.701492537313433

2438372,5,B000BR9RQK,"The fact that Capoiera, the Brazilian Martial Art, which figures prominently in this movie, was originally considered a dance, done by African slaves, accounts for the strange title.  Its French title is more accurate Le Clan.  The movie is about the power of the family, the Clan, how it supports us and holds us fast.

2438374,5,B000BR9RQK,This is an excellent story about 3 young men and how each one deals with the death of their mother.  The acting is first rate...by the entire cast.  There is drama and excitement enough to keep you interested throughout. The young men are as different as night and day...but this is what makes the story so unique.  I loved it...and plan to watch it over and over again.,1363046400,,370,4.411764705882353
2438375,5,B000BR9RQK,"This is a beautiful movie, which gives a glimpse into the lives of these 3 young men.

Yes there are several hot bodies and hot guys, however, if you purchase this expecting a gay theme you are wrong. There is actually little sex in this movie at all. Two scenes that are not graphic at all. This movie is more about growing up, the choices we make and how they can impact our lives. I love french films and this did NOT disappoint!",1324944000,2,451,4.195402298850575
2438377,2,B000BR9RQK,"Many times in online forums for film reviews, I read reviews with which I don't agree but I can still often find in the film the elements to which reviewers responded either positively or negatively. The reviews on this film, however, almost seem to me to be talking about a different film. This film is poorly paced, acted, lit, cast . . . There are certainly some beautiful images but they aren't shot particularly well. I had a lot of hope for this one as a film exhibiting the passionate (non-sexual) male bonding mentioned by reviewers here on Amazon and found none of it. As you read this, however, bear in mind that negative assessments of this film, here and elsewhere online are rare. Those of us who did not like it are in the minority.",1320105600,,746,4.492647058823529
2438378,4,B000BR9RQK,"Another very good film from director Gael Morel, not up to the level of ""Full Speed"" or ""Apres Lui"", but good nonetheless.  It is the story of an exceedingly dysfunctional family:  a bitter, ineffectual widower and his three sons.  The eldest, Christophe (Stephane Rideau) is an ex-con trying to straighten out his life.  Marc (Nicholas Cazale) is a rebellious, violent drug user.  Olivier (Thomas Dumarchez), the youngest, is a quiet, sensitive boy who misses his mother and her stabilizing influence

This is a violent, often disturbing movie (the killing of Marc's dog and his subsequent attempts at revenge in particularly).

Rideau, Cazale and Dumarchez are superb.  Salim Kechiouche, as the lover Olivier finds necessary to give up for the sake of his brothers, is also fine.  The letter he reads to Olivier, which frames the third segment, is heartbreaking.

The cinematography is gorgeous.  (How could you go wrong with the French Alps as the backdrop?)  The musical score is rather intrusive, loud and somewhat repetitive.  The ending seems a bit forced given what has gone before.  But it does leave one with the sense that there is hope for these very damaged people.",1314316800,,1178,5.036269430051814
2438379,4,B000BR9RQK,"Gael Morel creates an interesting & unusual tale about three brothers, ""Le Clan.""  Stephane Rideau from ""Come Undone"" plays Christophe, apparently the older brother who is in jail when their mother passes.  Olivier is the younger timid brother played by Thomas Dumerchez.  He begins a romance with Hicham played by Salim Kechiouche who teaches him an athletic slave dance.  The film hinges on Marc played by Nicolas Cazale.  Cazale's shaved head gives him a stark look throughout the film.  He won a Best Actor award for ""Le Grand Voyage"" in 2005 from the Newport International Film Festival.  He plays Marc well, a young man whose anger is barely controlled.  When drug dealers make him kill his beloved dog, Marc swears revenge, injuring himself when unable to go through with a planned hit & run.  Bruno Lochet plays the father who is emotionally lost after his wife's death, unable to give his sons the strong hand they need.  Morel toys with the audience, particularly in a sensual bath between Marc & his dog and with the three brothers sleeping arm in arm in nature's birthday suits as their father stares at them.  Their lives splinter as Christophe gets promoted at a meat packing plant and plans to marry.  Marc tries to recover from his severe injury.  Olivier breaks up with his boyfriend and appears to court the hand gliding instructor.  There is no great climax at which someone wins & loses.  Rather we have four men dealing with a tremendous burden of grief, each trying to find reason and a way to live.  Enjoy!",1226620800,5,1529,4.756653992395437
2438380,5,B000BR9RQK,"This is a beautifully made film. The acting and production values are superb. I think the reason that some reviewers have difficulty with this film is just that it's a very simple film...It's about three young men dealing with the loss of their mother, and a father who has lost his wife. Each brother finds his own way to deal with his loss; one through drug abuse and self injury, one becomes his father, and another discovers his courage and learns how to love. Morel allows the characters to breathe, and respects us enough to expect us to pay attention to visual clues which are equally important as spoken dialog, without spelling out all the details. Morel is masterful at depicting the emotional tone between individuals and groups. For instance, the scene in which Christophe has just come home from prison is extremely complex. There's a great deal of homo-erotic nuance between the brothers and their friends in this scene. While Morel creates a space for it, and fully inhabits it, he never feels a need to make a point of it, to make a statement. There's simply no need for that. It's not that they are gay or straight, but precisely that the lines between gay and straight are rather fuzzy between these good friends. Putting that message into words would create a self conscious tone in the film which would destroy the dense fabric of emotional ambiguity between the brothers. It may be that the brothers emotional problems have to do with the intensity of their feelings for each other, as well. In the end, each takes his own path. The plot is entirely subservient to the emotional issues of the characters. If you're looking for a plot driven movie, this film has a plot, but the issues that drive the plot are almost entirely internal. This is a film not primarily about events, but how people respond to events and the ways in which their responses change their lives. Viewed from that perspective, this is a unique and powerful film.",1218758400,12,1955,4.702623906705539
2438381,2,B000BR9RQK,"This movie was just another version of TLA's way of luring in gay people with a sexual cover to another droll movie, but this time it really made no sense!!  The plot, if there was one, was very hard to comprehend. Three brothers each trapped in their own vices, but you never get to fully explore any of their lives to realate or sympathize for them.  A miss for me!!",1214611200,4,368,4.242857142857143
2438382,3,B000BR9RQK,"This is the second movie from director Gael Morel I have watched recently. The first one being ""Full Speed."" I rated ""Full Speed"" poorly. By watching this second movie, I understand why. I feel this director is very unorthodox in his expression of gay issues, and by being not familiar with his style of directing, am missing the point of what is being presented.

His stories are about a bunch of people, mostly men, in a particular point of their lives. There is no main gay theme. These people could be gay or straight. There is violence in one or two of the characters. He is very much appreciative of the human male form, as all of his actors are very athletic, good looking, perfect bodies (no nerds.) He also makes an emphasis on Arab men, particularly from Algeria, North Africa.

This movie revolves around three brothers, Marc, Christophe, and Olivier (the youngest.) Their mother had died painfully and all the boys missed her terribly. Christophe is in jail. He comes out of jail toward the middle of the movie and joins the family (he is straight.) There is one more boy, Hicham, an Arab young boy who is gay and friend of Marc. This boy becomes romantically involved with Olivier. Olivier being the only gay som in the family (he loose his virginity to Hicham without any of the other brothers knowing.) I am not sure what Marc is.

Marc gets into trouble with the local thugs (drug dealers) because he owes them money. He gets beaten by them and he is forced to throw his prize dog over a cliff to the town river. I almost turn the movie off as I am an animal lover (I don't think there was any cruelty to the animal, it is just part of the story.) Marc wants revenge and to kill the thug who hurt him and kill his dog. He wants his brother Christophe to help him but he refuses. He then becomes bitter towards his brother. Toward the end of the movie, Marc gets hurt seriously by attempting to run over his nemesis, he misses his target totally, hitting a tree in the process. His anger got the best of him.

Christophe gets a job in town after his release from jail and he gets promoted right way, and he finds a girl who is going to marry him, and his life seems to be progressing nicely. Hicham dumps Olivier (I do not know why) after using him. Hicham is a dancer and teaches Oliver the art. Olivier becomes real good (competitive). Marc becomes paralyzed but makes a struggling recovery. The final scene shows Olivier going into a building with a hand gliding instructor. Hicham has taught him to hand glide.

Even though I found this movie to be better than ""Full Speed"", the plot was again somewhat confusing. These are not your ordinary ""gay"" movies. The scene of the three brothers, in an interlocking position, sleeping naked, is very provocative and erotic, talking about brotherly love (the father was totally mesmerized watching.)

The movie near the French Alps making the scenery rather beautiful.",1198368000,4,2928,4.557034220532319
2438383,3,B000BR9RQK,"I'm always sure I lose much of a movie with subtitles so I'll blame myself for not being wild about this one, in French with English subtitles; but all the fault cannot be mine. THREE DANCING SLAVES directed by Gael Morel is set in a small town in France where three young brothers, Marc, Christophe and Olivier, are trying to put their lives together after the death of their mother. They argue constantly with their father and often with each other.  The angst-ridden Marc gets into real trouble over a soured drug transaction; Christophe gets a dreary job in a meat plant after getting out of prison; and Olivier, the seventeen-year-old, is trying to find himself.

Some of the landscape photography is gorgeous, and the acting by these three young men is certainly acceptable. There is a tremendously moving scene where Marc and Olivier secretly scatter their mother's ashes. The film never quite comes together, however, and some of the footage is completely inexplicable. For example, why does Marc need to shave his pubic area? Additionally although these three young men play brothers, they look nothing like each other. The film ultimately leaves the viewer with more questions than answers.",1149292800,5,1200,4.995
2438384,4,B000BR9RQK,"This movie was not only thought provoking and visually stunning at times, but brought me back to my boarding school days. (I went to an all boys boarding school.)

2438385,3,B000BR9RQK,"This movie exhibited wonderful filmography, surprisingly convincing performances and gorgeous young men. Where this film was lacking tremendously was the plot. Even though it had so much potential, it's execution was haphazard, and too much time was spent on unnecessary scenes, so toward the end it felt rushed, and the relationship between Olivier (Thomas Dumerchez) and Hicham (Salim Kechiouche) if it were developed more deeply, would have made for a wonderful film. Finally, the ending left me lacking as if it would continue next week. In other words, the entire film felt like an episode in a larger series. It felt unresolved; unfinished. And the extended Soliloquy, conveyed in the form of letters written to Christophe (I believe) certainly did not make up for a proper ending. That really frustrated me.",1141776000,13,814,5.221374045801527
