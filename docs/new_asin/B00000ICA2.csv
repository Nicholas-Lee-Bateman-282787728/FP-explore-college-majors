7910564,1,B00000ICA2,"I got this tape because my husband hates to read and I thought this would be a good way to educate him about what to expect but it was pretty lame.  You'll get much more useful and practical info from your local library or the thousands of ""what to expect"" books on the shelf.  My library offered a wonderful videotape series on pregancy and childbirth that was much more interesting and informative.  Dont waste your money on this.",1028592000,2,432,4.512820512820513
7910565,2,B00000ICA2,"I found little of value in this video.  The information is rather scanty and the style is somewhat insulting to the intelligence. It tries to be cute, but it ends up being silly and not too helpful.
I would not recommend that anyone spend money on this video, but if you have a chance to view it free (I borrowed my copy from the library) then it does offer some input regarding a few common questions of pregnancy.  However, a better source would be just about any pregnancy book, or simply the woman's doctor/midwife.",981072000,6,519,4.51063829787234
