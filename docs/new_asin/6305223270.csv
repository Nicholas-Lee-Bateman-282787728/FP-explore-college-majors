7885200,5,6305223270,A wonderful story that makes you think about the Nazi times.,1411257600,,60,4.545454545454546
7885201,5,6305223270,"This series of films, first viewed on TV, are truly refreshing. They tell their story in a gentle way (not macho) and yet keep the viewer in suspense most of the film. Evil and terror is still very apparent throughout, and what is intimated is just as bad as if graphically seen on the screen. Before viewing I thought I had seen enough Holocaust/Nazi films for a lifetime, but when I first saw ""Two Families"", part of this series I was wrong. I loved this one as well - ""Two Couples"". I am glad I took the time to watch two of the videos from this series and hope to see more. I was very impressed with the positive way these films were presented and it pleased me to know they were true stories of individual courage and strength. All of the acting is topnotch and the films are very heartfelt, proving that human kindness can overcome hate. The message is one of hope. I have seen other films that are similar and it seems they always show the people who are helping finally becoming victims, which is quite depressing. I know that happened, but it is nice to see a success story for a change. These films are different - they encourage and inspire. We all need to know there are those who would risk all to save their fellow man, especially in this chaotic world. Take a chance and view these films - you will not be sorry...the stories are memorable.",1105833600,4,1355,4.359683794466403
7885202,5,6305223270,It is nice to see a series of films that actually inspire us to do more for the next person rather that looking out for number one and that show quite heroism versus the macho/macha bravado that passes for heroism in too many films.,996710400,2,232,4.295454545454546
7885203,5,6305223270,"It would be a good film if it were fiction.  But add the fact that all the ""Rescuers"" videos are based on true stories, makes these even better.  The honesty, the courage, the fear...are all shown and felt.
Based on actual events that take place during World War II, real heroes - families, couples, women - went beyond their means to save Jews from sure death.  Hiding them, feeding them, keeping them safe from the Nazis.  Terrible conditions.  Lack of food. Under continuous watch.  Never knowing who you can trust. In danger every moment of every day.
Don't miss any of these films.  They will inspire you.  I like to think that in today's society we would be like these ""Rescuers"".  And yet I hope I don't have to ever experience what any of these people did.  They were real heroes!",980726400,10,788,4.524822695035461
