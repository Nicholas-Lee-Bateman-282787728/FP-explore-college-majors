1638476,5,B00005O072,"I've watched this movie repeatedly and it always makes me laugh. In my family, it is considered a classic. It is full of excellent sight gags as well as memorable, hilarious characters. It's one of those films you will be reminded of repeatedly in life situations (perhaps that's a commentary on my life?). It's goofy, harmless humor.",1281312000,,334,4.87719298245614
1638477,5,B00005O072,"Saw this film on the premier in London many years from now.
It's as good today!
Totally wacko and wonderful!",1264377600,,108,4.45
1638478,4,B00005O072,"Yes, it's British comedy- but not in the Monty Python vein. Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones had a very fruitful partnership for many years writing and performing in a series of ""Smith and Jones"" television shows, in which they presented exceedingly silly parodies in a completely deadpan manner, and in Morons from Outer Space they have succeeded admirably.

The plot is simple: Four aliens- one of them of average intelligence (by Earth standards) and the other three about as smart as a rock- are out for a joyride when the intelligent one (Smith) gets separated from the ship, and the other three crash it into the Earth. What follows is a broad satire of all the traditional sci-fi conventions along with sly shots at ET, Star Wars, Close Encounters, and no doubt other films as well. The aliens are investigated by scientists, hunted by the military, until finally they find their place as... well, I won't spoil it for you.

I'd never heard of this film until I discovered it playing on a local TV station late one night. I didn't expect much, as sketch comedy rarely translates into feature length films, but Smith and Jones' did a fine job with creating a solid, ridiculous plot that carries the viewer along to the end with plenty of smiles and a few laugh out loud moments as well.",1262390400,,1290,4.6535087719298245
1638479,4,B00005O072,"'Morons from Outer Space' is a dumb, stupid, silly movie.  It's also fraught with laughs.  It's not a laugh a minute, but it's got some very, very funny scenes, including a take-off of 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest.'

Four aliens vacationing in outer space in what looks like a third-rate motorhome get bored and decide to take a side trip to Earth.  Three land in England, and one lands in Arizona.  As the first aliens to visit the Earth, they are hailed as the super-intelligent beings they must be to travel the galaxy.  After a few minutes, though, it dawns on Earth's representatives that the aliens are complete and utter idiots.  For example, when asked what planet the visitors are from, one of the aliens (Julian) says he just can't remember.  However, it's blue-y and green-y and has some wispy clouds in the sky. Turns out it does have a name, very appropriate.

The aliens soon wear out their welcome and become more of a side-show than objects of admiration.  One starts hawking beer while the three in England are on live television.  The movie goes downhill as they are promoted as rock stars in the 'Kiss' mode.

It's a very British comedy, so if you like Monty Python and Death at a Funeral, you'll like this one.  Recommended for those with a silly sense of humor.",1262390400,,1327,4.595744680851064
1638480,5,B00005O072,"I loved this cult-like film when it was first released.
Do not expect logic, sense, or reality. Remember it's a movie about MORONS, and it lives up to it's title splendidly.",1258761600,,173,4.612903225806452
1638481,5,B00005O072,"This is not a high-brow comedy, but neither is it the typical low-brow stuff being produced today that focuses on bodily functions and groin punches.  This is British comedy, which means that it actually has some wit, in between the sight gags.  If the comedy of Peter Sellers, the absurdity of Monty Python, and the sheer outlandishness of the Rocky Horror Picture Show appeal at all to you, then this movie will tickle at least one funny bone.",1209168000,,445,4.6923076923076925
1638482,2,B00005O072,"Was looking forward to seeing this with two of my favorite British comedians (Smith and Jones), but this was VERY weak....maybe one genuine laugh throughout.  Mostly lackluster comedy will be forgotten minutes after viewing.",1049241600,3,224,5.588235294117647
1638483,5,B00005O072,"Who needs acting, plot, or great editing in a comedy. Obviously this film doesn't, all it needs is jokes. This is probably to silly for the movie critic, but for all the normal people out there who aren't stuck up about the movies they see, this is a ral treat. A trio of very dense aliens abandons their equally dimwitted pal Bernard and crashes their rented spacecraft in England, where they become pop media icons under the guiding hand of a disgruntled television employee. Bernard eventually finds his way to America, where his claims of interplanetary pedigree land him in an asylum. This satire of science fiction and societal quirks from British television comics Smith and Jones and director Mike Hodges brings us a hilarious yet silly movie that is quite enjoyable. See it!",1044576000,4,783,4.850746268656716
1638484,5,B00005O072,"I laugh all the way to the end of this possible cult-classic english comedy! Mel Smith plays the alien who was left behind and falls into earth.  There's a hilarious part occur with him and a trash barrel which he think it's a earthling.  The other aliens fall into other mishaps and enjoy ""LOOB"" beer! and remember it's a pen ""P......E....... uhhh....n..n!..",1043020800,,359,4.774193548387097
1638485,4,B00005O072,"If you liked 'transylvania 6-5000', and enjoy british comedy, i.e. bean, monty python, black adder, then this might be for you.  I laughed throughout the movie, rent it and see what you think!  i hope you enjoy it.  lars",963273600,3,220,4.589743589743589
7948183,5,B00005O072,"Seen this on COMET TV and had to find the DVD version. Very witty satire spoof comedy. Love the CLOSE ENCOUNTERS segment spoof when the scientist tries to communicate with the space craft by playing the TONE MODULE, then he breaks out playing an array of scoreboard hits. Or when the craft hits earth sliding down the hi way and the old couple sees the craft coming at them in their rear view mirror. It's silly, nutty, humor for sure. A mix of SNL and Monty Python. Trailer trash from outer space with a steering wheel lined with fur and furry dice hanging in the window.",1514764800,,572,4.40566037735849
7948184,4,B00005O072,"This film was included in a compilation set of science fiction DVDs I purchased.  I have watched this film several times and have enjoyed it'  It's humorous and also a parody on modern life and society, especially the ""worship"" of celebrity.""

7948185,5,B00005O072,I loved this movie.  It's a very British comedy.,1465257600,,48,4.333333333333333
7948186,5,B00005O072,"For those who like Britsh humor and British comedies, if you haven't seen this one, you have no idea what you're missing. Once again, the British have turned the view of ETs on it's head--with a group of clueless wandering redneck types in a space Winnebago RV, from the planet BLOB. Seriously.

The ending is absolutely golden, as are the many visual puns and the various levels of verbal wit throughout the film. It's kitchy, campy, at times outrageous and has more a touch of the classic Monty Python humor, as well as humor reminiscent of Fierce Creatures or a Fish Called Wanda.

The only ""space humor"" I like better is the original Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy radio series from the BBC (worlds better than the ridiculous movie that came out not long ago)--though Dr. Who will always stand as the benchmark for space operas.",1464566400,,834,4.705479452054795
7948187,4,B00005O072,Pretty funny movie. At least Mel Smith is funny in it.,1437091200,,54,4.0
7948188,3,B00005O072,"I've never heard of this super low budget film. So many references to other films. The film itself would be stupidly funny without them, but the finished product comes off as both funny and very witty",1402358400,,200,4.583333333333333
7948189,5,B00005O072,Greatest film achievement of all time.  The ultimate sight-gag of all time - especially for people who are curious how astronauts blew their noses while dressed in their space suits.  RIP Mel Smith.,1376784000,,198,4.96969696969697

7948191,4,B00005O072,"Very funny film, kind of reminded me of Python. Check it out. Its worth a lot more than 55 cents.",1309824000,,97,3.9
7948192,2,B00005O072,"""Morons From Outer Space"" is a great concept for a parody. Four daft aliens crash their ""Podule"" on Earth due to their own incompetence. Earthlings are prepared to accept their hyperintelligence as a given, but they are collectively as dumb as a box of hair. Most of the comedy is very broad with occasionally amusing bits of satire thrown in (particularly related to the Cold War.) For instance, when the alcohol-guzzling space loons crash their ship in England, they do so on the M1 motorway, causing a substantial traffic snarl. What is the punch line to the scene? After being nearly run down by the Podule, one motorist says to another ""I think he was Belgian."" Hilarious, no?

The aliens are split into a group of three, Julian Tope (Paul Bown,) Sandra Brock (Joanne Pearce,) and Desmond Brock (Jimmy Nail) who are staggeringly imbecilic. The humor associated them was so sub-Benny Hill I could almost not take it (don't miss the hilarity of the exploding cooker scene.) The remaining moron in question, Bernard (Mel Smith,) is actually only slightly mentally-deficient, but spends the bulk of the film in a mental hospital (not funny,) talking to garbage cans (somewhat funny the first couple of times, not so funny thereafter,) and trying to get his former friends to acknowledge him (oh, the pathos.) Obviously there's a lesson in there about the meaning of true friendship, but it's pointless in a farce of this nature. Throughout this movie I couldn't think of Mel Smith as anything other than an actor trying to do his best John Candy impression in a film that would have actually been suitable to Candy's choice of roles. I think Smith and Griff Rhys Jones who plays Graham Sweetley can be quite talented writers and performers (much better than John Candy,) but their efforts here come up way short.

There were a few touches in the writing that were quirky and funny (e.g. ""When you're in the tub and a man-eating spider crawls out of the faucet, you don't ask him to pass you the soap."") There were even a few funny satirical concepts, as when Bernard defeated the asylum employees who tormented him with an ""Iron Maiden"" album by wearing earplugs. Sadly though, for each amusing moment there are a hundredfold more like the execrable worst ping pong lesson ever.

There are a few nuggets of humor in here, but while I love British cinema and television, and I love satire and comedies, this is less playful than it is painful.",1282003200,3,2443,4.7706855791962175
