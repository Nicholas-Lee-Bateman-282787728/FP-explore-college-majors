6621789,5,B00NARLQP8,"This is the one and only one movie where Raymond Burr swings into physical action.  At the end of Heartbroken Bride, as one of the bad guys rushes the witness stand, Burr does a side step take down on the guy and yes, I'm certain just about everyone is going to say this was done by a stuntman although it would be nice if it came out that Burr really did the stunt.  Anyway, it was really worth getting this DVD.",1430438400,7,413,4.08641975308642
