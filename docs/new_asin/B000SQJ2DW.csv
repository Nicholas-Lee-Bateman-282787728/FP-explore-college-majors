8206398,3,B000SQJ2DW,"Like other DVDs from the Seefestspiele Mrbisch, this production of ""Die Csrdsfrstin"" has a giant outdoors stage, huge production numbers, visible microphones, and a large number of feathers. Like those others, it's done with complete professionalism and high polish.  And when the songs mention a thousand tiny angels you can bet there are at least seven or eight of them doing a kickline.

Unfortunately, the cast simply isn't that great, and never succeeds in standing out from the monumentally large scenery.  Vera Schoenenberg's voice lacks the heft for Sylva Varescu, and she never makes the nightclub singer anything interesting.  Ferdinand von Bothmer sings Edwin well, but his acting repertoire consists of about five hand gestures.  Neither creates a real character or impression.  One oddity is the WWI-set prologue, which sets a serious tone that the production never follows up on.

There's nothing really wrong with this (though the casting of low baritone Markus Werba in the tenor role of Boni is weird), but operetta falls flat without charm.  Unfortunately there is little of that on display here.

If you want a fun time with ""Die Csrdsfrstin,"" you're probably better off with the gloriously cheesy TV movie with Anna Moffo and Rene Kollo.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kalman-Die-Csardasfurstin/dp/B000FVRACU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kalman - Die Csardasfurstin</a>&nbsp;The cuts are severe, but the score is hardly intact in this version either.",1259625600,6,1512,5.8054298642533935
