8666336,5,B00LKSHEYG,I've  watched it 7 times! Great plot twists. Kim Nam Gil and Son Ye Jin have wonderful chemistry.,1445472000,,97,4.388888888888889
8666337,3,B00LKSHEYG,"Honestly, I was disappointed with this movie. I purchased this TV series dvd set hastily based on the 5 star review (only one) and I was curious to see Nam Gil Kim in a modern drama (as I was so impressed with him in Korean historical drama, Queen Seondeok). Probably it was a bad script but this drama didn't bring out any suspense (everything was revealed in the beginning) and vulnerability of his romance Kim portrayed so well in Queen Seondeok. Background music was too much and too noisy.",1418774400,,494,4.561797752808989
8666338,5,B00LKSHEYG,"I marathoned Shark (2013, they call it Don't Look Back here, so beware of bootlegs!) over two days and couldn't even sleep all night because it was so packed with tension on every episode. I loved Ye Jin Son and Nam Gil Kim as the leads, they had sublime chemistry together, and I loved their younger counterpart actors! Never before have I seen two young actors who so perfectly capture the physical and emotional characteristics of the adult actors. Also, the cinematography was lustrous and enchanting, some of the images were like paintings! I would freeze the images just to STARE at them! The OST was also beautiful and haunting. The K-drama of Shark falls under the radar unfairly, and needs more exposure! It's dynamite! One of the best. Great classic romantic storytelling.",1407715200,2,782,4.887218045112782
