2183195,4,B0006GAO40,I think that it was a positive movie.  Leon the Lover started out doing what his family wanted him to do and that was to be a doctor. Instead he became a boxer and succeeded against the odds and got the beautiful reporter played by his then wife Jayne Kennedy.  She was excellent as well playing the nieve reporter out to interview the champion boxer and falling in love.,977270400,,371,4.36231884057971
2183196,2,B0006GAO40,movie was fair including the nude sequences and the boxing sequences,921715200,,68,5.2727272727272725
2183207,4,B0006GAO40,"It was more of a nostalgia thing for me.  I'm a child of the late 70's  - 80's. I remember when cable & video stores began, and this was one of my favorite film discoveries.",1407110400,,173,3.914285714285714
2183208,5,B0006GAO40,"This movie is a classic! Even though old boy (Leon Issac Kennedy) was kinda full of himself back in the day, he still managed to play a recurring role in movies like this....  And OMG! He was actually married to 1 of THE FINEST SISTERS back in the day (Jayne Kennedy)....  Man, who didn't have a picture or poster of her up on your wall or inside your locker? Right. Plus, he had enough sense to ask ""The Greatest of All Time"" (Muhammed Ali) to make a cameo appearance in the movie....  That alone can make any movie an instant classic. Ya' dig?",1405900800,,545,4.271844660194175

2183211,5,B0006GAO40,"Remember the days of Issac Kennedy as Leon the Lover, one of the greatest boxers of his generation. As fast as Muhammad Ali, with the style of Sugar ray Leonard and the strength of Mike Tyson.  This movie is one for your collection.",1387843200,,232,4.395348837209302

2183220,5,B0006GAO40,"Yes! I totally agree with you in saying, ""This is one of the greatest movie ever made!"" I was fortunate enough to be an ""extra"" as part of the cheering crowd in the box ring audience. This was back in 1980 and I recall calling in sick just to get an opportunity to meet Muhammed Ali, Jayne Kennedy and Leon Issac Kennedy. We had a  ball and filmed on location here in beautiful San Bernardino Orange Show Theatre!!!

2183221,1,B0006GAO40,"This simple story line had the potential to really shine with Jayne Kennedy as the female lead. She plays the true champions prize as the male lead chases & gets all that doesn't count. Towards the end she's still trying to teach him how to be a man.

The sad truth here though is the story appears to be nothing but what a white man would think a black boxers life is really like. By the way, I'm white. Leon the Lover is a toon & once you get past the St. Louis Assassin all the other boxers are portrayed as toons. The fight he is to lose for Mr. Big, a six year old could of written & choreographed better. The little sister puts in a good performance where she appears & it would of been better to have more of her on screen with her brother, Jayne & her mother. That doesn't mean a goody goody ending. Just less poor writing, fewer tits & more emotion based scenes. Yes I know its legendary how many breasts are available to boxer's but that was true when Rocky was made. This would of been ten times better written & directed by those folk's. I'm not asking for a change in actors or actresses they did fine with what they were given.

In the end it doesn't matter how the boxing storyline goes because this is supposed to be about peoples character & maturity. That's why so many cartoons as personalities are disappointing. If however, you are going to spend a lot of time in the ring lets not disrespect the talents of real boxers by showing this kinda s**t. Do boxers cheat? Yes! Do they cheat like all-star wrestler's? No! I could of lived with a happy love story ending, broken love story ending or everyone winds up with nothing ending. Little sis can live or die. What I can't live with is this particular story & how it's told. What a waste of good casting. Makes me angry!",1265587200,6,1789,4.274336283185841
2183222,5,B0006GAO40,"This movie is one of the greatest movies of all times.  Waited a long time to get this movie was very hard to find, but thanks to Amazon I now have it.
Jayne Kennedy is and was one of the most beautiful woman I have ever laid eyes on.

This movie I recommend for all action, drama, and lovers alike to watch.",1254096000,,308,3.9516129032258065
2183223,5,B0006GAO40,"WOW!
that's all i could say when i found this movie on DVD.

So when I saw that it was avail. i hurried up and ordered it.
It is the original! so was glad about that. the clarity is unbelievable
and the delivery was swift!.",1238371200,,279,3.8275862068965516
2183224,4,B0006GAO40,"THis is one of my guilty pleasures. Its not that its a bad movie but it is so cliche' but who cares? Because this movie is just what it should be, a feel good story where the hero wins and the bad guys get whats coming to them. Too Sweet goes legit and becomes Leon the Lover. This is one of those movies that can play in the background when your cleaning up. It is what it is but its so good at doing what it do.",1218499200,,413,3.7586206896551726
2183225,3,B0006GAO40,I remembered this one as I saw it in the movies as a kid. I think they cut the sex scenes though. Still I always enjoyed Leon Issac Kennedy and Jane Kennedy.,1202428800,,157,3.9375
2183226,5,B0006GAO40,"I remember this one very big movie for leon issac kenndeys it was a big movie back then, they pulled all the punches for this one .It even had big stars showed up for this one. Like rat packer peter lawford,and muhammad ali. I  can remember this playing at the movie to a packed house. What I really liked about it was that it has a good story line and some funny scenes like the mexican boxer when he threw the baby on the ground ,that was some funny stuff back then buy this one for the memories.",1111017600,,498,4.081632653061225
