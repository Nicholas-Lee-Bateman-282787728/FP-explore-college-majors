1373912,5,B00004YA66,"This was a well made movie that someone put a lot of thought into. To have small jesters in the beginning of the movie reflect an even greater meaning  later in the movie were numerous and incredible. The expressions on John  Sullivan's face throughout the movie were what made the meaning of this  picture come to life. You could see a bitter/angry person become a changed  individual just by watching his facial expressions. I enjoy taking friends  to this movie just to hear how much they,too, loved it. I have seen a lot  of movies in the past 3 months but none were done as good as this one. I  can't wait to go back for the 8th time. If this movie would of been  promoted more it would of captured more attention.",967852800,3,719,4.353383458646617
1373913,5,B00004YA66,"I don't know how they did it, but this movie is one of the most emotionally challenging, heart-wrenching, intellectually stimulating movie  I've seen in a long time.  I'm not one to go see a movie in theatres more  than once, but thus far I've seen Frequency in theatres three times and  would be willing to see it at least two or three more times in theatres if  it stayed there that long (am also chomping at the bit for when the movie  comes out on video).
I think what makes this movie so great is two-fold:  1)It is a mixture of so many different genres that just about anyone can  appreciate the storyline.  People who don't normally like sci-fi can  appreciate it for it's dramatic impact, as well as the mystery story that  is interlocked within the father-son feel-good drama.  2)The story is  woven together so well that there are no loose ends to be tied up.  A great  big hand to the writers and other contributors for paying so much attention  to minute detail!  The 'plants' early on were used well to help the  audience along and guide them in the right direction.  Also, all the little  things (secondary headlines, radio voiceovers) that were used to give the  audience little hints into the lives of these people were very  strategically placed and pricked the subconscious at a level one only  realizes later.  One of the reasons I've seen the movie three times already  is that I notice something new or can read something into these little  hints every time.  Even the commercials on older John's television set  contribute to the story line (pay special attention to the ironic  significance of the polar bear Coca-Cola commercial to see what I  mean).
A wonderfully stimulating movie for anyone and for any'time' :)",967852800,2,1738,4.677740863787376
1373914,5,B00004YA66,"Even if you hate superficial stories, you will love this movie.  It is a love story(!); it is a thriller; it is a dedective story... It's been quite  a while I was not moved as such. Dennis Quaid is at his best; it seems like  he is getting better every day. If you have a father, just see this  piece...",967852800,,304,4.016666666666667
1373915,5,B00004YA66,"I LOVED this movie.  Have always been a sucker for time travel stories, can really get into the science fiction of talking across thirty years.  The premise that John could avert the tragedy of his father being killed  should touch everyone in some way, we all have things in our past we would  like to change.  That story alone could have been a whole movie, but no,  there's more....then there's the wonderful thriller of a serial killer and  his threat to John's family and John and his father teaming up to catch the  bad hombre!  If you haven't seen this movie/video yet, do it TONIGHT!",967593600,4,591,4.552380952380952
1373916,4,B00004YA66,"I had the opportunity to see this movie during its theatrical run this spring.  I work for a movie theatre and to be honest, if I saw this trailer one more time, I was gonna barf.  But, undaunted, I watched the movie anyway.  It was really quite good.  The story was fresh & original.  Granted, it was a little far-fetched, but it was an intriguing drama.  Dennis Quaid is a firefighter in the 60's with a wife & young son.  During a failed rescue attempt, he perishes in a fire, and his son grows up without his dad.  Flash-forward to 2000, and the son is a police officer struggling in his relationships.  He uncovers his dad's old HAM radio, and through freak cosmic circumstances, he is able to communicate with his dad in the 60's prior to his death.  Through their interference, they are able to alter the past, which then alters the future.  It's a race against time in order to set things right in both eras.  I don't wanna give any spoilers away, so I just say watch this film.  Very original, and one of the best movies I saw this year.  Keep a phone close by, because afterwards, you may just need to talk to dad.",967507200,2,1124,4.315789473684211

1373918,5,B00004YA66,"When you first see the preview you think it is kinda of a drama, but it turns into an amazing suspense film. The last 20 minutes are very tense.

The film is very well crafted and well worth the money, BUY  IT you won't be disappointed, this is a great movie.",967161600,2,350,4.117647058823529

1373967,4,B00004YA66,"Despite some Plot Weaknesses here, and there, and some bad New York accents, this is a very sweet movie about the Love between a Father and a Son, as they fought to restore their broken family.
I think it was casted just fine, but Jim Caviezal and Dennis Quaid, in particular, made a very sincere pair.

I like how they didn't draw things out, where most films might try to make things as vague as possible, for as long as possible.
Within thirty seconds of talking on the radio, they were calling each other out on strange statements, and it was very clear what was going on from the beginning.

No messing around, and playing dumb.
This movie was very real in that way.
(down to business)

Now, overcoming the fire, and then the serial killer, etc, that's a stretch, and so were some of the things that went along with it, but even so you just wanted to see them reunited.
It had a satisfying ending, which is rare.

Maybe I got too drawn into it, so I'm making too many exceptions for its weaknesses.
Even so, this Father and Son relationship hit my core, and swept me up in the hopes that there would be a happy ending.",1513987200,,1123,4.333333333333333

1374079,5,B00004YA66,"I only found this movie recently.  I've watched it a few times, and it's amazing how well it holds up despite its age.  One of the better aspects of this movie is the fact the time travel isn't useless.  There have been a lot of time travel movies that end with either nothing changing or the protagonist killing themselves to prevent a tragedy, and you wonder why you bothered watching a movie that destroyed its own reason for existing.  The protagonists this time aren't able to make everything right, but the world is definitely better off after their meddling.

The premise is that a father and son are able to communicate with each other across 30 years over a ham radio, but only at certain times.  It has something to do with the aurora, but the aurora seems to create some kind of general time travel field instead of only focusing on the radio because they are able to communicate in other ways, too, like when the father burns the table and the son sees the letters slowly appear in the future.  The past changes several times over the course of the movie, and the pair have to deal with the guilt of contributing to tragedies that originally didn't happen.  It reminds me of the bridge-keeper's dilemma, only they're in a position to prevent all the tragedies, both the ones that originally happened after their contact, and the new ones caused by their changes.  The movie paints women in a pretty good light, too; instead of just being prizes to win or protect, some of the women, particularly the mother, have a strong influence on the plot.  It's more about the two men, though, and I dare you not to cry at the end!  As anyone who's tried to get a loved one to quit smoking knows, smokers can be ridiculously stubborn.  But when the father heard his son needing him 30 years in the future, he quit without hesitation to ensure he'd still be there.  Now that is some parental love!",1485216000,,1897,4.511695906432749

1374177,5,B00004YA66,"I saw this movie in its original theater release. All these years later, it still holds up.

Forget the premise of how the father/son communicate. Just accept it.

Once you do, sit back and enjoy. This movie has everything: suspense, action, who-done-it, and strong, family values.

As I said, the ending is great. Totally unexpected.

And Dennis Quaid has never been better.

I am very interested to see how the author of the movie has adapted the story into the new TV series. I can only hope it is as good as the movie although I recognize that he can't ""end"" it as satisfactorally as the movie or they won't have a series.

But watching the TV series shouldn't destroy the enjoyment of the movie. So go and rent/buy it even if you have watched the TV show.",1475884800,2,760,4.471014492753623

1374251,5,B00004YA66,"One of my all time favorite movies. I've watched it numerous times. THis is one of those movies that you need to watch when you have time to really pay attention. I'm really bad about watching and multitasking. You'll miss way too many details if you do that with this movie. My suggestion if you haven't seen it before is watch it once, then watch it a second time because you'll catch a lot more that you miss first time around.
The first time I saw this movie it was a gifted rental from a ham radio friend. He said go rent it and watch it, you'll love it. So I did and then purchased the movie. I have it on dvd. I rented it the other day on here because I wasn't at home and wanted to watch it again. So I watched it on my kindle fire.
The movie pops back and forth between the past and the present and sometimes both at the same time through the ham radio due to the northern lights. So first time it can be a bit confusing. I really think you'll enjoy it as much as I do.",1468713600,,978,3.969543147208122

1374258,5,B00004YA66,"This is not merely a sci-fi movie as a dim-witted friend of mine opined.  First, it is a love story between a father and a son.  Second, it is a murder mystery which takes 30 years to solve, and is filled with suspense.  Third, it is a movie with characters who love baseball.  Finally, in my view, the sci-fi element (aurora borealis) which permits radio signals to be sent and received from past to present, and actions in the now to change the past, is the ""device"" underlying the plot, but certainly not the point of the movie.  Excellent performances by all, fast-paced, tense at times, great scene-changing photography, with an ending which is very rewarding.",1467763200,,665,4.698275862068965

As the father is a fireman, and 343 firefighters lost their lives in New York where this movie was set, it served as an Erie reminder of the lives lost that day, although a very strange coincidence at the same time.

1374442,5,B00004YA66,"5-stars -- A great father and son tale

This movie/DVD features several of my favorite actors, specifically for favorite movies of mine that they've played in. Dennis Quaid -- Breaking Away, The Right Stuff, Great Balls of Fire!, Frequency, The Rookie, The Day After Tomorrow, Flight of the Phoenix, The Express. Jim Caviezel -- Frequency, The Count of Monte Cristo, Escape Plan. Noah Emmerich -- The Truman Show, Frequency, Miracle.

There are many things that I like about this movie -- Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel, Noah Emmerich;  the plot;  Frank Sullivan's Harley-Davidson motorcycle;  the amateur radio story line;  the science of the aurora with Brian Greene;  the funny lines; the baseball including the Amazing Mets of 1969 (even though I'm a Phillies fan) -- but the most important thing that I like is the connection between father and son. Until you contemplate or experience not having a father, it is hard to put into words how important that connection is for a son.

Unfortunately, in my personal experience as a son, I did not really have that father. There are only two occasions, both times when I was younger, that I had a momentary connection with my father, but it was only short-lived.  Hopefully, things are different with me now being a father and having a son who I hope has a connection with me.

In the movie, John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) is lost in his life without his father who was killed fighting a fire while John was still a kid.  John has just broken up with his girlfriend, he is drinking heavily, he is not at 100 percent with his job as cop, and he's keeping his struggle to himself instead of sharing it and trying to work it out.

Enter the freakish behavior of the amateur 10-meter band traversing 30 years of time due to unusually high sun spot activity. John has an opportunity to reconnect with his dad, Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid), and for a period of time you see John finally connecting back with his present world. The scenes of them talking to each other sitting at the same table working the microphone on the same radio, but 30 years apart and in mirror image position is a priceless juxtaposition.

But that moment is short-lived, because although John's advice to his dad about the next day's fire saves Frank's life, something alters the past in such a way that John's mother, Frank's wife, has died and is no longer alive at the present time like she was before. And that starts the weaving of the past and present story of the Nightengale Killer.  I won't say anymore so as not to spoil the movie.

However, I do want to point out that I liked Gordy, John's best friend. First, when as a kid he speaks to John through Frank's radio, and John tells him about the magic word ""yahoo"". Then, at the end of the movie, Gordo has a Mercedes whose license plate is 1YAHOO.  Noah Emmerich does a nice job playing the adult Gordo, and staying out of the way of the primary story.

A final point of interest -- If you watch closely the TV in the background between John's time of 1999 and Frank's time of 1969, you'll see Dr. Brian Greene, the emminent physicist, being interviewed by Dick Cavett about the same topic of auroras but thirty years apart. Now that was amazing.

The DVD also has a nice background featurette. I liked the movie immensely and give it 5-stars.",1447545600,,3318,4.604414261460102

1374590,5,B00004YA66,"This is one of my favorite movies. It may not be the most scientifically accurate movie, but it unless you are over analytical you'll be too wrapped up in the story to even notice.
If you have lost your father, especially when he was still relatively young (mine passed in his early 40's), I guess it has more of an impact on you.
And the both of you never really got along when he was alive, this movie will get to. It seems that the older you get or become a father yourself; you start to look at your dad (or mom) in a different light.
If there was any way that you could somehow talk to your dad...or mom for that matter...is there anything you wouldnt give just to have a few more conversations with him?
Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel as father and son just works. They are really believable in these roles.

1374635,5,B00004YA66,"Watched this with a friend in the theatre in 2000. I guess I just remembered the good time I had with her then anything else she came from London and was British. I felt this was a good movie for both of us. I was in my twenties and this was a good memory for me and when I saw her again in London in 08 she remembered this movie. I forgot the name of the movie at that time and was surprised this was one thing she remembered when she was in the states

Granted Dennis Quaid was in a lot of movies that didn't make the cut such as Waterworld, but I did remember watching this movie and liking it. Who knows if it was just because I liked being around her or the movie itself.

The movie also has a special place in my heart my buddy Paul died a month or so ago, and he was an avid ham radio operator.",1429315200,,801,3.8484848484848486

REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS

John Sullivan's life was forever altered when his firefighter father Frank was killed in the line of duty in 1969, when John was only 6 years old. John was raised by his widowed nurse mother, Julia, and made his childhood dream of becoming a cop a reality, working homicide under his dad's best friend Satch.

The 36-year-old John (Jim Caviezel) lives in his childhood home, and one night, he and his best friend since childhood Gordo, find Frank's old ham radio. John hooks it up and while fooling around with it, not really expecting anything to come of it, he connects with a faint voice. Initially not knowing who the man is, they talk briefly about baseball. The next night, when that same voice comes across the ham radio even stronger, and asks how John knew exactly what was going to happen in the World Series game that was played that afternoon between the Mets and the Orioles, John tells him it wasn't too tough, since the game happened 30 years ago. A few sentences later, John realizes that somehow, he is talking with father Frank (Dennis Quaid) back in 1969! He tries to prove himself by reminding Frank of Frank's childhood nickname for him (Little Chief) and the song Frank used to sing to him at bedtime every night (""Take Me Out to the Ball Game""), but Frank isn't buying it and thinks some psycho is stalking him and his family. When he threatens to hunt down this phantom voice on the ham radio ""until the day I die,"" John informs him that he already died, in the Buxton fire...which, John soon realizes hasn't happened yet, but WILL happen the next day in 1969!

Frank is still angry and refusing to believe he's talking to his son 30 in the future. John frantically tries to get his father to listen to him, managing to get out, ""If you would have just gone the other way, you would have made it!"" before losing the connection.

The next day, Frank's company is called to a four-alarm fire at an abandoned warehouse formerly owned by the Buxton company...which gives him pause when he sees the name on the outside of the burning building. Could that nut on the radio have been on to something?

When Frank gets trapped in the flames, he recalls the words from his supposed son--""If you would have just gone the other way, you would have made it!""--and instead of following his instincts, he does indeed go the other way...and does indeed make it out of the building alive, also saving the life of the unconscious runaway teenage girl he went into the building to save in the process.

While this is happening in 1969, at the same time in 1999, John is having a drink with Satch and Gordo at a bar. Gordo toasts to Frank: ""Here's to your dad. 30 years ago today."" Then suddenly, lightning-flash memories begin flitting through John's brain: John growing up, and his dad is there with him and his mom! Camping trips, Little League games, washing Frank's fire-engine red classic Mustang in the driveway, Frank showing young teens John and Gordo his ham radio. John drops his drink, shattering the glass into a million pieces, and announces to the shocked Satch and Gordo that his father didn't die in a fire. They look at him oddly as Gordo reminds John that John's father died of cancer 10 years ago.

Father and son reconnect on the ham radio that night, with Frank no longer doubting that ""the voice of an angel"" that ""reached right out of Heaven and pulled my butt out of the fire"" is his Little Chief, all grown up. Separated by 30 years, but connected by this ham radio, Frank and the grown-up John talk long into the night. You might want to have tissues handy for this part.

John tries to reach his mother Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell) after saying good night to Frank on the ham radio, but gets her answering machine, leaving a message for him to call her. Then he goes to sleep and has a disturbing dream that makes little sense. He is 6 years old again, crying and wearing a black suit and tie, hiding underneath a table covered with a tablecloth and clutching the cross necklace his mother always wears. His mother is nowhere to be found, but their house is filled with people dressed in black and talking quietly and somberly...including a priest. Frank finally finds little Johnny hiding under the table by getting down on the floor, lifting the tablecloth, and seeing his son sitting there in tears, clutching Julia's necklace.

Jarred awake by the disturbing dream, John again tries calling his mother...but an irate voice answers the phone, ""Noah's Deli."" He hangs up and redials a few seconds later, only to get the same irate voice insisting that this is Noah's Deli.

John gets dressed and goes into work, where Satch (Andre Braugher) follows him into the men's room and lectures him on respect (""You can disrespect yourself all you want, John, but you will NOT disrespect me!"") The excavation of a female skeleton has reopened a cold case that John is assigned to: a missing teenage girl from 1969, who turns out to be the first of ten victims of an uncaught serial killer the police tagged The Nightingale Murderer, because, with the exception of the teenage girl, all of his victims were nurses.

When John corrects Satch that there were only three victims, Satch looks at John incredulously and forcefully reminds him that there were ten victims, and John should know that better than anyone...whereupon John attacks the stack of case files on his desk, and while sifting through them, finds a file on his own mother...Julia Sullivan. She was one of The Nightingale Murderer's victims!

John reconnects with Frank on the ham radio that night and breaks the news to him. Frank initially thinks that Julia has just died in 1999, but is horrified when John tells him that no, she's going to be murdered by a serial killer in a few days in 1969. Frank just wants to get Julia and little Johnny the hell out of town, but for John, that's not good enough. There are seven other women that weren't supposed to die. John figures out that because Frank didn't die in the Buxton fire, Julia worked her regular shift at the hospital that night, saving the life of a patient who turned out be The Nightingale Murderer in the process. Frank's chief and the family priest went to the hospital to get her when Frank died, so she wasn't there that night, and the guy died after having killed only three people. But because Frank didn't die after John's warning across time and space, Julia was at the hospital to save the guy, and he went on to kill seven more people, including her!

Father and son team up across time to work together to save the woman they both love, and the other seven victims as well. John is relieved when he reports to Frank that ""Carrie Reynolds [one of the victims] is alive and well today because of you, Dad"" (since John had the case files and knew where the killer would be and what he would do when he got there, John gave Frank the locations and descriptions of the women; Carrie Reynolds moonlighted as a waitress in a bar and Frank went to the bar the night she was supposed to have been murdered and just hung around until last call, kept her talking, and made sure she got to her car safely, since she was murdered in the alley behind the bar; he didn't see anyone particularly suspicious, he told John).

Things take a turn for the worse, though, when Frank tries to save the second victim, Sissy Clark. She too is moonlighting as a cocktail waitress, but at a different bar than Carrie Reynolds. Frank tries to do for Sissy what he did for Carrie but fails because the killer gets the drop on him in the bar's men's room, knocks him out, and steals his driver's license from his wallet. By the time Frank regains consciousness and gets to Sissy Clark's apartment, she's dead.

Although Frank feels terrible about Sissy Clark, John tells his dad, ""Dad, we got him! His prints are on your wallet!  Take your wallet and hide it someplace in the house...someplace no one will look for 30 years!"" Together they decide that Frank will wrap his wallet in plastic wrap and put it in the dining room window seat, under the loose board inside the window seat. Frank and John maintain their ham radio connection while Frank puts the wallet in the window seat, and John retrieves it 30 years later.

John has gotten a positive ID on the fingerprints in 1999 and discovered that the killer is a reitred cop named Jack Shepard. He has a tense verbal confrontation with Shepard in a bar. Shepard's mother, a nurse, was murdered years ago. ""If they had known your mother was nightingale, they would have looked closer at the family, Jack. They would have looked at you."" Shepard asks John what he's looking at. ""Stealing your life away,"" John replies. ""You went down 30 years ago, pal. You just don't know it yet.""

John is relating this to Frank via the ham radio when Satch shows up at the Sullivans' in 1969 with a couple of uniformed officers to take Frank down to the station, because his driver's license was found under Sissy Clark's dead body. Frank physically fights Satch not to be taken from his family, and once he is dragged down to the police station, Satch tells him that unless he can come up with an explanation for how his driver's license ended up under this dead girl, they're going to make him for Sissy Clark's murder. So Frank tells Satch the truth: John, the ham radio, the 30 years' time difference, all of it. Of course Satch doesn't believe it. But Frank, John, and Satch all three were die-hard Mets fans, and this was 1969, the year of the Amazin' Mets' World Series win, and John described every game in detail to Frank even though Frank himself had only seen the first two. The day Frank is hauled down to the police station is the day of the last game of the World Series, the game which featured the world-famous shoe polish pitch: the ball hit batter Cleon Jones on the shoe, getting a smear of polish on it, and Mets manager Gil Hodges insisted, on the basis of the shoe polish on the ball, that Jones be awarded first base because he was hit by the pitch. ""You just go and watch the game, and if it don't happen, then I'm a liar!"" Frank challenges Satch while also dropping Jack Shepard's name as the real killer and insisting he knows it's true because John told him...on the radio, from the future...that the fingerprints match.

Meanwhile, Julia Sullivan has tracked Satch down, demanding answers about why he dragged her husband and his best friend out of their house in front of 6-year-old Johnny and Gordo. But Satch is too distracted by the ball game to give Julia many answers or much comfort...and when he sees the Cleon Jones shoe polish pitch and Jones trotting to first base, he realizes that Frank was telling the truth after all!

Frank manages to escape from the police station by setting off the fire alarm (he is a firefighter, after all) while Satch (and most of the rest of the precinct) are watching the game, and he goes after the killer himself. Now knowing Frank is innocent, and willing to check out Shepard, Satch and his partner break into Shepard's apartment after Frank and Shepard have already had a fight there. Satch and his partner follow after them, finally finding them at the river, where it appears that, in a literal fight to the death, Frank has killed Jack Shepard.

Frank is allowed to go home to his family, while police divers suit up in scuba gear to search the river for Shepard's body. Frank fixes the ham radio, which got broken when he knocked it off the table when Satch and the uniforms dragged him out of there earlier in the afternoon, and he is able to contact John in 1999 and tell him that it's over.

John looks around his house, though, and his eyes fall upon the family pictures: pictures of just him and Frank and their dalmatian dog Elvis. ""If Mom's okay, then where is she?"" John asks plaintively.

""But...I killed him,"" Frank says, puzzled.

And it is in that moment that Jack Shepard shows up to the house in both 1969 and 1999, ready to kill every Sullivan he finds in both years! Can Frank in 1969, and John in 1999, finally put an end to Shepard once and for all, without losing either of their lives, or the life of their beloved wife and mother Julia, in the process?

1374795,5,B00004YA66,"Satisfying, spooky, spellbinding, stimulating, stirring and swiftly-paced. Steven D. Greydanus said, ""Frequency touches upon the profound human longing to escape the constraints of time, to see the wrongs and mistakes of the past somehow set right, redeemed."" Ecclesiastes teaches that God has put eternity in the human heart. This film also explores how important a father can be to his son. Frequency is a time-travel story and a detective story that touches on these important themes in an entertaining and imaginative way. It ingeniously weaves the story of the 1969 Amazin' Mets into the plot, as well. My favorite scenes are the first conversation between John and Frank after the fire, Cleon Jones and Satch in the diner and the softball scene. I've been an English teacher in China the last 12 years, and I've shown this film to thousands of students. It never fails to be a crowd-pleaser, although it's been rough on eye makeup.

1374911,5,B00004YA66,"FREQUENCY is a personal favorite, an unusual amalgam of the fantasy and crime genres that was written by Toby Emmerich.

During a few days of unique October weather where the aurora borealis flashes in the night sky, 36-year-old homicide detective John Sullivan speaks over a ham radio to his fireman dad. The twist is, Frank Sullivan's been dead 30 years and he's in 1969 while John is in the present (1999). Both use the same radio, in the same house. The concept is mind-boggling.

Once he's able to convince his dad that he really is his little boy speaking from the future, John gives him some life-saving advice, but in so doing history is altered, and a killer who disappeared after three homicides has now murdered six, including someone close to both men. To put things as they were, John and Frank have to find a way to catch this guy in 1969.

Includes one of the most brilliant finales of all time.

1375008,5,B00004YA66,"Why don't they make good movies like this more. Love interest, action, suspense, drama,  humor. And the whole family can watch it.",1397952000,,130,4.909090909090909
1375019,4,B00004YA66,I was at the laundromat after washer broke and saw the middle of this. I wanted to see the entire thing so I purchased it. I'm not usually a sci-fi person but the movie was good.,1397952000,,178,3.9722222222222223
1375020,5,B00004YA66,"I watched this movie when my husband was away and thought he would love it as he is a retired volunteer fire chief and a retired volunteer police officer.  I told him I couldn't understand why this wasn't bigger than it was when it was released. But when he watched it, he told me the reason it wasn't as well received was because the plot was so intricate.  The light went off, he, like his mother, likes to visit while they are watching a program, therefore, anything which holds your total interest I cannot watch with him.  But for me, a person who likes to be immersed into a movie and the plot grabs you and never lets you go until the very end,  This is my kind of movie.",1397606400,,678,4.1923076923076925
1375021,5,B00004YA66,Always liked this movie and decided to buy it as oppossed to watching it butchered up on cable. Gets more intence as the movie moves along. Good stuff.,1396742400,,151,4.428571428571429
1375022,4,B00004YA66,This is one of the few movies I consider worth owning and watching from time to time. I like having the actual product verses buying digital copies.,1394928000,,148,4.518518518518518
1375023,5,B00004YA66,"I bought the American BLU RAY of ""Frequency"" on New Line Home Entertainment because I've always loved this 'talking to my Dad 30 years ago' Fireman movie with a passion.

Directed by GREGORY HOBLIT and written by TOBY EMMERICH (older brother of the respected actor NOAH EMMERICH  see below) - ""Frequency"" has built up a bit of a cult fan base since its 2000 release. Ive had it on many 'Slipped Through The Net' Amazon lists for years.

It's the night of 10 October 1969  the Baseball World Series will be played out on television sets across American Homes the following day. But that night the atmospheric dance that is the Northern Lights of The Aurora Borealis is doing strange things to the skies over Brooklyn. Its even messing with the airwaves.

Lighting a cigarette - Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) looks up at the phenomenon and smiles. Frank is a hero father and all round good egg - a fireman that fights the blue beast with courage by day, rides his Harley home afterwards and plays catch with his 'chief' son of 6 on the sidewalk outside their home at night. Until 11 October 1969 - when Frank enters a warehouse down by the docks and in trying to rescue a woman on the top floor  takes a wrong turn to get out of the building. Neither escapes and The New York Post sadly reports the death of another true blue who didn't make it

Cue to 30 years later in October 1999 and Jim Caviezel is John Sullivan  his 'chief' all grown up  a cop who is boozing, losing his wife and still hurting over his Dads loss. His buddies since childhood on the Force Satch and Gordo (Andre Braugher and Noah Emmerich) are worried about him. Gordo (the excellent Noah Emmerich - Jim Carreys Sea Haven mate in The Truman Shoe) drops by with his son for a chat and to share a Brewsky. But his bored young son (an early part for Michael Cera) finds an NYFD Radio Transmitter in a locked box hidden in a cupboard that everyones forgotten about. The device is old school with glowing valves  and you need a licence just to use it. John gets it working  but when no one is in the house and through the crackles  John hears a mans voice  his Dad Frank from 30 years back.

Disbelieving at first - John then begins to realize the potential of the situation and tells Dad how to save his life, which will end the next day (in his time). Dad does just that and Johns future changes accordingly. Frank hasn't died in 1969 but in 1989 from lung cancer. But now a serial killer called ""Nightingale"" who targets nurses has also lived and killed 15 women instead of 3  one of which is Johns Nurse mum Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell from Lost and Revolution). Now both father in 1969 and son in 1999 are locked into a cat and mouse game with this monster to alter that list. And on it goes to a genius ending that is wholly satisfying

The picture is 1080p High Def with an Aspect Ratio of 2.4:1 (16 x 9) so it stretches to the full screen and looks great  rich colours and hues  even in a lot of the darker night sequences. Subtitles are English SDH and Spanish only.

There are times when you cant quite nail why a movie gets to you so much  or why you hold it in such affection. Perhaps its the father and son thing  the good guy wins  the pig gets his comeuppance  or perhaps its just the sheer likeability of the lead actors given great material to work with.

Whatever way you look at it  ""Frequency"" on an American BLU RAY is a winner. Great movie, top extras, nicely rendered and reasonably priced into the bargain.

Let ""Frequency"" burn its cosmic greatness into the wooden table of your viewing lounge real soon...",1394668800,,3913,4.466947960618847
1375024,5,B00004YA66,"Highly recommend.  Unique twist on communication through time.  Very good movie, keeps your attention.  We love this movie and would recommend it to all ages.  I love how it all works out.",1394582400,,188,4.78125
1375025,4,B00004YA66,"When I first saw this film, it was at a discount theater in Los Angeles. Wasn't expecting much going in, but as it went on I found myself emotionally drawn into the story.

Dennis Quaid, JIm Caviezel, Elizabeth Mitchell, and Andre Braugher all give outstanding performances. As well as, the rest of the supporting cast.

Story wise it's very layered. It's a period piece, science fiction, thriller, and family drama. What I enjoyed most was the father son relationship. There aren't enough movies that represent good, strong, caring fathers. However, this one is the exception and that's the heart of this film. There are a few unanswered questions, but they are minor in terms of the over all story. It's well worth a purchase if you can get a hold of a copy.",1394496000,,760,4.706766917293233
1375026,5,B00004YA66,Loved this flick. Full of mystery and suspense tempered with family love. Acting was superb. We'll casted. Would highly recommend.,1394409600,,130,5.55
1375027,5,B00004YA66,I bought this movie for myself after seeing it on Television. What a great story line that will give you goose bumps. I won't ruin it by telling you anything about it but do go out and rent it for yourself. It's a thinking movie for grownups that you will enjoy for a long time. Who doesn't like Dennis Quaid anyway? :-),1393632000,,320,4.17741935483871
1375028,5,B00004YA66,Such a great movie!  One of my all time favs!  So many interseting twists and turns.  Better pay attention or you'll get lost!,1393459200,,126,4.391304347826087
1375057,4,B00004YA66,"This is a good story telling device to show off the ham radio, and it may be old, but it will be around if and when natural disaster hits.  The movie also tells about a relationship of a father and son from the past, but rekindled in the future over ham radio.  In the father's past when his son was a little boy, he talks to his son in the future.  his boy grew up to be a cop, and now he is desperately trying to save his dad from death by fire.  But he saved his dad, and now his mother ends up dead in the future, so now both son and dad try to find the killer, and put a stop to him or her before all three of them end up dead in the past and in the future.  The killer figures it all out, how this is happening, and he has target this family in a suspenseful and respectful movie about saving people, and loving your family.  A very big heart feel this movie has.",1392768000,3,869,3.8268156424581004
1375058,5,B00004YA66,May be this could be the best Dennis Quaid movie.,1392768000,,49,4.0
1375059,5,B00004YA66,"Oh how I enjoyed this movie! I'll let you read all the other glowing reviews for it by those who know far more than I about Sci-Fi and all things techie that I know nothing of. I just know that I was absolutely GLUED to my tv once this was popped into the DVD player. I don't usually watch a movie more than once, but I will be watching this againand maybe even a 3rd time one day. As good as the original Time Machine (or even the 2002 version of it as I love both of those too).
You won't be disappointed. You might have to suspend a bit of logic, but my brain doesn't go that deep into whatever I had to suspend, but I did so and all was still wonderful!",1392681600,,657,3.91044776119403

1375064,5,B00004YA66,"Even though this is based on a superexceptional event that allows a father and son to connect,via a ham radio,  it is one of the best I've seen. John Caviezel and Dennis Quaid are perfect  in this movie.  I bought it for my 2 college-age granddaughters to see (along with The Majestic) as they had never seen these movies and they both loved them. The movie is probably more meaningful to me because my husband was a fire fighter. You get the impression that John is sort of a lost soul, until he is able to connect with his father via the radio and you immediately get drawn into the story.  There is not a slow moment in this movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes good acting and a great story line..",1390521600,,717,4.25
1375065,5,B00004YA66,"This is a very good movie, well acted with a great script. This is in my best of FAMILY LOVE STORIES shelf. Not a romantic movie, but a great moving story of Love of Family.",1390435200,,173,3.9714285714285715

1375087,3,B00004YA66,As was expected with a movie from the early turn of the 2000's.  standard quality reformatted for 1080 BR which failed.  Can see the grains in the 1080 and the 720 formats.,1389744000,2,172,4.34375

1375089,5,B00004YA66,"It's a really good film, I've seen it loads of times, it's about a man that losses his Dad in a warehouse fire, (as his Dad is a fire fighter) the story goes that Johnny (Jim Caviezel) through the Northern lights being more prominent than normal they make the radio waves easier to be reached from longer distances and so also Johnny is able to reach his father Frances Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) from the past (30 years ago) on his father's special radio that he kept in storage under the stairs. As the Two finally realise that they are father and son in a worped time zone within centuries apart they both work together and change history and stop murders from happening that involves there family member Mum/ and wife which normally wouldn't have happened, it's a really good film that is a thriller that will be a gripping story from beginning to end and has a twist that you won't expect, well worth the money, a must see movie, I'm sure you will enjoy it as I did and do on regular occasions...",1389139200,,998,4.429347826086956

Ironically, at the time this came out, it was priced nearly twice as much as the other, which was why I just assumed it would be the better of the 2.

1375124,5,B00004YA66,"Frequency is the best movie of all time, but maybe it just seems like that to me since I lost my dad 50 years ago when I was the same age as the son in this story.  And, of all of the World Series ""match ups,"" I recall the 1969 World Series the best.  If the Mets had not stolen the Cubs' pennant that year, history would have been so different.

1375204,5,B00004YA66,One of my favorite movies. The 2 main actors stand alone and are good enough reasons to buy this film. But the thing I like best about Frequency is the huge life lesson: every decision you make now impacts the future in ways you can never forsee! I've watched this movie a dozen times and I learn something new each time. I'd recommend multiple viewings to piece it all together (it jumps back and forth in time).

1375250,5,B00004YA66,"This film was much, much better than I expected and I spend a nice moment watching it. The review below contains some limited SPOILERS.

""Frequency"" is a very original and well thought variation on the theme of time travelling - but with a BIG twist. The story begins in New York in 1969, when the main character, John Sullivan, is only 6 years old and continues in the same place thirty years later, when he is 36. Jim Caviezel (mostly known for his outstanding performance as Jesus in ""Passion of Jesus Christ"") plays the adult John Sullivan, a somehow depressed and borderline alcoholic police officer, who was just dumped by his girlfriend. Denis Quaid plays the equally important role of John's father, firefighter Francis Sullivan - and he is EXCELLENT in this role. In 1999 Francis Sullivan is no more around and his son misses him greatly. And then one evening, when tinkering with the old radio he inherited from his father, John Sullivan will start a conversation with another radio amateur operator, who also lives in New York and who sounds oddly familiar...

What follows is a very interesting tale of mystery, tragedy and history changing, mixed with elements of thriller. There are parts of this film which really kept me on edge, especially considering that main characters are pretty likeable and I was seriously worrying about both of them, as things were getting more and more dangerous for them... Also, the ending was pretty surprising and I did not see it comming. There is also a really, REALLY bad guy in this film - and the low key, low drama way in which he is pictured made him actually even scarier...

Pay great attention to TV broadcastings which can be seen (or sometimes only heard) discreetly in the background and also to newspaper titles of which the most important appear mostly on the very bottom of the screen...

I am not going to say anything more and if you want to see this film try not to read too much about it. The twists and surprises are a particularly important thing in ""Frequency"".

I give to this little known film five stars, because it very pleasantly surprised me, impressed me even in one or two scenes and I spend a really, really good moment watching it. Enjoy!",1357862400,,2218,4.691516709511568

Completely ignoring the warnings of Doc Brown and Marty McFly, he immediately spoils the upcoming World Series and dozens of important life moments for his father, before the two decide to pair up in search of an unresolved string of historical murders. The film can't decide if it wants to do the sappy paternal bonding thing or follow a more suspenseful path, and its main plot mechanism is clunky, under-explained and inconsistent. It's also routinely telegraphed from beginning to end, with a narrow scope limiting its potential escape routes and an overdose of father-son baseball allegories. Hackneyed, hammy and haphazard, it plays like a bloated sci-fi short story in desperate need of revision.",1340755200,,920,5.059210526315789

Frequency is a love story, a fantastic story about the shared love between a father and his son. The connection between the two is deep and abiding, forged by a fireman's need to love, protect and guide his son, and a son's need for the safety line of love only a father can provide.

But John's father is killed in a fire wherein he heroically tries to save a young, runaway, lodged in an abandoned warehouse. For over thirty years, having grown up without the protective love of his father and then tragically without his mother's love, young John Sullivan is lost, adrift at sea.  A picture of depression, he can not find the strength to love anyone else and scarcely himself; he is stuck in time.

John, like his father, is a protector; he is a cop searching for a solution to the Nightingale serial- murderer case, a case which connects both his mother, his father and ultimately himself.  Across the warped, phenomenal channels of time, Johnny is miraculously connected to his father via a ham radio, on a frequency spanning the thirty years distance between them. With John's knowledge of the events of time and working as a cop, can John save his father, protect his mother, bring his loving family together, and redeem himself?

As I watched the movie again, I heard something in the final scene I had not attended to before.  Johnny's dad, finally reunited with his family, is on third base, when he calls out to Johnny:  ""Bring me home, chief.""  That did it for me.  I've always loved baseball as a metaphor for life.

""When You Come Back to Me Again,"" sung by Garth Brooks in the final scene, is poignant and metaphorically helps depict Johnny's journey from a boy and man adrift at sea to a man guided by the lighthouse, and the powerful, transcending love between father and son, a restoring love, a love bringing John's family home safely- to shore.",1311465600,,1885,4.61377245508982
1375311,5,B00004YA66,"Review of the $30 Canadian version:  The one star refers not to the movie, which for me, is a five-star movie, but rather to the cheaply done blu-ray version of this movie.  All the commentaries, extras, subtitles, etc., have been stripped out in this overpriced ($30 USD) Canadian version of the blu-ray, as compared with DVD versions.  It's so sad, because I own the American, German, and Czech versions of the movie on DVD, which have all been well done, with all the extras you would expect.  This new stripped down no-menu 'your movie will start now' without your control, idea of creating blu-rays is awful!  Shame on companies who cheaply do this just to get something quickly out on blu-ray!  The whole idea of blu-ray is not just the high def, but also all that available space so that you CAN add other languages, extras, etc.  Talk about a waste of space on a blu-ray disc!  I have also noticed this same thing with two other blu-rays I've purchased recently, movies I really love:  ""The Return"" and ""Dark Water"" (all three of these are my most recent blu-ray purchases and seem to indicate a trend, heaven forbid).  The movie starts automatically without the ability to go to a menu and when you hit the menu button, you get the ""forbidden"" sign.  If you're lucky enough to have a ""pop-up menu"" button on your blu-ray player, then you can sometimes get some minimal functionality through that -- but still not much.  On this DVD, the entirety of all extras and extra functionality is that you can listen to it in French or English, not even any subtitles!  The DVD versions are what you should purchase if you want to have anything beyond that.  I'm not sure the high def alone is worth it if all my blu-rays have no extras nor ability to control the little functionality that may exist on them.  Update as of 20 April 2012:  I see that another version of this movie is coming out on Blu-Ray.  It is half the price of the other.  Hopefully it will have the extras that were stripped out of the other!

Review of the $15 American version:  Update as of 10 July 2012:  I am SOO pleased with the new blu-ray disc of 2012!  It looks like the definition problem has been fixed.  Extras have all been added back in.  This is the American version, available for half the price ($15.00) of the useless Canadian one.  All the wonderful extras of the DVD were added back in.  Other languages were added, and to my delight, a Czech language track (I'm currently learning Czech full blast).  In short, I've changed my rating back to a 5-star rating and added this update.  I'm so glad that those responsible for making this and doing it right this time!  Hats off!  Thank you...finally.",1308787200,11,2686,4.535416666666666

1375325,5,B00004YA66,"In 1969 Francis ""Frank""  Sullivan is a married man with a 9 year old child named John. He is a firefighter, and while out on a call dies.

His death affects John deeply. In 1999 John is a cop working with Satch-who was one of Franks good friends. They uncover a body of a woman who was murdered by the ""nightingale"" Murderer about the time of Franks death-which forces them to reopen the case.

In both 1969 and 1999 there is a solar flare. In 1969 Frank comments to someone on his ham radio that he can talk to people that he normally would not be able to because of the flare.

In 1999- days before the 30th anniversary of Frank's death- John's friend Gordo finds the ham radio and they plug it in. Soon John is talking to someone on the radio.
This movie is about the relationship between a father and son that spans time and death.

After several conversations John realizes that he is actually talking to his dad-and he warns him about the fire that kills him-not realizing that by doing that it will change the past in ways neither of them can imagine.

But we believe it. The charm of Frequency is that the relationship between the two (Frank is Dennis Quaid and John Jim Cazaviel) is so strong, the time travel seems almost plausible. As soon as they establish that they are indeed in touch--they use plays of the Mets '69 World Series to verify- both take advantage: first to save the father from the fire, and his Camel Cigarettes, to catch a killer.

I won't reveal much more plot, but the 1969 scenes have amazingly real detail, and the father son friendship is genuinely touching to watch.

Can the son, by talking to his father in the past, save his father's life? His mother's life? Stop a serial killer? You'll find out, in a very well acted and suspenseful movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you guessing how the meddling in time is going to next effect events.

It is at that level, through the fine work of the cast and the creators, that people felt much of their pleasure in the film.

1375348,4,B00004YA66,"In the thriller Frequency, directed by Gregory Hoblit (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primal-Fear/dp/6305127697/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primal Fear</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fallen/dp/0780622537/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fallen</a>), audiences were given an unexpectedly well-made science fiction/suspense film. The film is an expertly directed piece of entertainment that will have viewers so absorbed in its thrilling story that they may have trouble coming back to reality after the end credits have rolled.
The film, which was written by Toby Emmerich, explores what happens if a person could alter the past by communicating through time. And while dealing with such heady quantum conundrums, the story also allows for moments of genuine emotion.

Troubled New York detective John Sullivan's life is changed forever when he contacts his father, Frank Sullivan, with an old ham radio. What makes their reunion so extraordinary is the fact that Frank died in a fire thirty years earlier. When John realizes that the Aurora Borealis (or Northern Lights) is enabling him to communicate with his father in 1969, he warns him of his death, thus giving Frank the opportunity to save himself and change the future. But altering the timeline proves to be complicated and dangerous as the Sullivan family soon finds out. When John discovers that his effect on the past has changed the future sequence of events, resulting in his mother's death at the hands of a serial killer in 1969, he must uncover the truth about who killed her so that his father can stop her murder before it happens. Utilizing his detective skills, John guides his father on a search for the killer, but the more they disrupt the course of events in the past, the more they find themselves endangered in the future. It's not long before the entire Sullivan family is under threat and their only hope for a life together is dependent upon Frank's resourcefulness and John's guidance. Can they solve the murder of John's mother before she's killed or will they be forced to watch as their temporal interference costs them that which they hold dearest; their family?

The film stars Dennis Quaid as Frank Sullivan and Jim Caviezel as John Sullivan. The supporting cast includes Andre Braugher, Elizabeth Mitchell, Shawn Doyle, and Noah Emmerich (the screenwriter's brother). Both Quaid and Caviezel give strong performances, as does the entire cast. Adding to the power of the performances is the subtle aging makeup that it is skillfully applied to the actors to help viewers differentiate between the characters in 1969 and 1999.
One of the things that makes Frequency truly unique is that it manages to root itself in the foundations of multiple genres. Being part science fiction, part murder mystery, and part family drama, the film could have easily fallen apart if it weren't for the concentrated efforts of its director.
Another interesting aspect of the film is that it's essentially a time travel film in which no one actually travels through time. Only information is relayed back and forth through the ham radio, which limits the opportunities for action and the visual effects set pieces while heightening the suspense.
Now the film isn't perfect. There are some serious flaws in the story's logic when it comes to quantum physics and the disruption of the space-time continuum, but the story is absorbing enough that this shouldn't bother many viewers.
Also adding to the film's overall impact is the exciting score by master film composer Michael Kamen, who combines taut, suspenseful musical cues with haunting themes that echo the emotions of the characters.
All in all, Frequency is an exhilarating thriller that should not be forgotten.

The excellent DVD includes an audio commentary by director Gregory Hoblit, an audio commentary by writer Toby Emmerich and actor Noah Emmerich, a trivia track, The Science Behind Frequency documentary, deleted scenes, image galleries, and more.

1375349,5,B00004YA66,"[Slight Spoiler Alert]

This is a great movie.  The sci-fi aspect of it is very minimal and only serves to underscore the message of the rest of the story.  Just how far would you go to save someone you loved?

When I saw it in theaters, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has good action. It's a great thought exercise. I just loved Quaid (as always). It just had the perfect combination of elements. When I got it for my brother for Christmas however I was surprised by the reaction my mother had after we watched it with the whole family. She was just sobbing at the end. I figured she would enjoy it, but I did not expect that kind of reaction.

In hindsight, though, it is completely understandable. The scene at the end where Quaid shows up to save his son is actually very affecting. The constant rift of time between a young man an his father creates a very unusual but effective separation. They can talk to each other, but that's it. At the end, however, the breaking of that barrier just at the time of greatest need for one of them creates a very emotional scene.

1375353,4,B00004YA66,"I'll say this first off; I really like this movie a lot.  When I first saw it in the theater I was in awe with it.  Sure, I'm not in `awe' anymore, but after watching this movie again last night for like the twentieth time I can definitely say that it still warms my heart.  I still get that same feeling every time I hear that Garth Brooks song start to play in the closing of this film; the tears welling in the eyes and this overwhelming happiness comes over me.  That said I must admit that this movie has its detractors, they just aren't enough to make me forsake the entire experience.

The concept behind `Frequency' is one we've seen done many times before and after.  The idea of changing the past is something that intrigues all of us I'm sure since there isn't one person on the face of the planet without regrets.  So here we have John Sullivan; a thirty-six year old man who lost his father thirty years ago in a fire.  His father Frank was a brave fireman who died saving a young girl from a burning warehouse.  This tragedy has destroyed John.  He walks around like a zombie with no cares in life whatsoever.  He still lives in his father's house, the house he grew up in, the house he never left.  It's interesting to me that his mother has since moved out but John stays behind, maybe further addressing the fact that John is the only one who has never moved on or recovered from his fathers death.  He stays in the past in everyway possible.  One night his best friend's son finds Frank's old ham radio and after tinkering with it John finds that he is able to contact a familiar voice from the past, his father.  He soon realizes that he has the opportunity to save his father, to rewrite the past but when he does his future is also rewritten.

One thing that I love about `Frequency' is that it works at being a better film than it could have been.  It could have merely been a film about a son contacting his dead father and working to save his life, but it does more than that.  With an intricately woven sub-plot involving a serial killer from the past who was never caught `Frequency' manages to keep the audience at the edge of their seats throughout the running time.  That is a huge plus.  It adds layers of intensity that would not have been there otherwise.

As far as the acting is concerned, Quaid steals the show.  I've always been a fan of this man.  He's a very talented actor who never gets the credit or the film roles he deserves.  He grabs a hold of Frank Sullivan with all he has and delivers the standout performance here.  He masters his accent beautifully, which is essential in this type of role.  Elizabeth Mitchell likewise delivers a beautiful performance.  She shows a lot of depth even though she has limited screen time and is obviously taking a backseat to the two leading men.  Shawn Doyle also delivers, sending shivers down my spine as the suspected killer, and Andre Braugher pulls off an impressive supporting performance as Satch DeLeon, Frank's close friend and John's eventual boss.

The biggest detractor for me though is James Caviezel.  I've never been too impressed with this actor but here he manages to bore me to tears.  I feel nothing from him.  His `depressed' John is so overly dramatized that he comes across irritating and unsympathetic.  I don't understand why anyone would want to be around him.  He's gloomy and moody and whiney and just a complete and utter mess.  James could have played him differently, could have played him better.  Sure, after he rescues his father he changes his demeanor a bit but it's too little too late for me.  The second half of his performance is far better than the first, I will say that.

`Frequency' manages though to still hold merit with me.  It's a much deeper film than it lets on to be and has the ability to touch the heart and warm the soul.  The final moments of the film, filled with this heart racing intensity are flawlessly performed and only add weight to the emotionally uplifting baseball game that closes this touching family film.  `Frequency' is a film about love and loss and that desired reconnection with loved ones; a chance to right wrongs and make better decision; a film about getting the chance to live again the consequences and responsibilities that lie within that chance.  In that respect `Frequency' works on a much greater level than one might expect and deserves to be seen and admired and talked about.",1202083200,2,4445,4.51188986232791

So, your ""helpful"" vote is greatly appreciated. Thanks, and note that a short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great movie or book.

I love ""Frequency,"" a story about communication across time using a ham radio (the 1950s to the 1980s). A father and son talk to each other, and alternate futures await them.

Enough said, this film is a grabber and a great example of how to build characters have a compelling plot, and all without excessive violence. It's a great murder mystery--I don't want to give anymore away--make it so long you won't want to see the movie.

The other thing that makes the movie great is that the action is subordinate to the plot. Too many movies today are all action and little or no plot. I long for the day when special effects and action are kept in balance and don't override the plot.

If you like time-travel stories, read the ""Far Arena,"" where a Roman gladiator is cut out of the ice in the North Sea and revived. Kind of a reverse time-travel theme, but one of the best novels I ever read. Highly recommended by a big-time reader.

Fast forward to 2007, and I finally got around to buying it in July. It's as good as I remembered! From the vivid imagery to the soul-stirring music, this film pulls you in from the start.

1375362,5,B00004YA66,"This overlooked film was only in theaters for a very short time, and most professional reviewers don't think that highly of it. For me, ""Frequency"" is my favorite movie EVER. If you're a father or a son and are not moved by the ""Catching Up"" scene, you've lost your heart. ""Frequency"" also has THE most wholesome love scene in any movie, when Frank (the father) comes home after the opening rescue scene and dances with his wife Julia in the kitchen. I've found a lot of (perhaps unintentional) depth to the movie, too - it's obviously about redemption (redeeming the past), but it's also about restoration and resolution (the son reconnecting with his long-lost father) and repentance (in the son's shouted line of desperation, ""If you'd just gone the other way...""). Another reviewer said the switching back and forth between 1969 and 1999 was confusing, but I thought the movie did a good job of making this switching very clear. As the movie unfolds, watch carefully how the face of actor Jim Caviezel's character is transformed from a deeply troubled young man into one who is confident and far more fully alive - this is a brilliant acting job by Caviezel, whose subtle facial expressions change dramatically and powerfully - yet almost imperceptibly - over the course of the film. On a personal level, this movie helped me change my life, as Caviezel's shouted line ""If you'd just gone the other way..."" reminded me that there were things that I needed to change in my life and go ""the other way"" on, in order to help ensure a better future for me and my family. I've watched this movie 30-40 times and have yet to grow tired of it, and I've got the poster of the movie framed in my family den. OF COURSE none of us can change the past, but this flick is a reminder that there will come a day when every tear will be wiped away, when all accounts will be settled, when every wrong will be righted in the greatest reunion of all. Until that day, may we remember that it is stories like ""Frequency"" that help us stay faithful along the way. Blessings to all who read this!",1185235200,2,2077,4.55614973262032

1375379,5,B00004YA66,"Frequency is a remarkable movie.  I just discovered it and am glad to see that others continue to add their comments here.  First, I must applaud the premise - the use of a ham radio as the device that connects father and son in a supernatural way.  My uncle was a ham radio operator and even taught classes.  It had a tremendous mystique all its own.

Dennis Quaid is fabulous.  He effortlessly portrays Frank Sullivan, a man who is passionate about his values, devoted to his family, and larger than life as a fireman.  The movie opens to this father's heroic rescue of a pair of workers trapped underground after a tanker crash.  He comes right home to the wife he loves, the son he loves -- John, his ""Little Chief"" -- in the home he loves; he has it all.  Moving forward thirty years, we meet the adult John.  James Caviezel tears me to pieces in these early scenes as we learn that this father died in a fire 30 years ago.  John is a cop working homicide.  He is still living in the house he grew up in.  He did not completely recover from his father's death.  He drinks to find numbness and his girlfriend (who he loves) walks out on him.  But he is a good man in his own right.  His mother's phone number is on his speed-dial and he takes the time to stay involved in her life.  On this difficult night in October 1999, as he approaches the anniversary of his father's death, his childhood friend Gordo (Noah Emmerich - The Truman Show) helps set up his father's old ham radio that they find looking for fishing gear under the stairs.  Later, with the aurora borealis glistening overhead, father and son make contact on this radio over the distance of 30 years.  Awesome!  My favorite scene on the DVD is captioned ""Catching Up,"" and takes place after a skeptical Frank, up to his ears in smoke and flames, follows his son's frantic warning that he should ""go the other way"" to safety rather than the death that John remembered.  On returning home unscathed, Frank, accidentally wakes his six-year old son, evolving into a joyous bike-riding lesson.  He then finds adult John's voice on the ham and they catch up.  At one point, Frank asks adult John if he is still his ""Little Chief"" and James Caviezel's tearful reply ""I'm trying to be"" is profound.  Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel run with their roles here.  They are two great American actors at work.

The entire cast is wonderful.  Elizabeth Mitchell as wife and mother plays so much love and strength into her role.  The screenplay, by Toby Emmerich, brother of Noah, is tight, tender and imaginative.  (The brothers do a great commentary together on the DVD special features.)  The crime-thriller sub-plot is gripping and the ending satisfying.",1182038400,2,2711,4.564315352697095
1375380,5,B00004YA66,"A thriller that associates many interesting elements. First a serial killer, running after him, trying to stop him, in the radical way of today, a good self-defense shot. Then a fireman (yes not very politically correct: firefighter it should have been, but in 1969...) father and heroism, and dying on duty. Then a nurse mother, which is rather banal but explains the overworking schedule of the mother and the over-protective attitude. Then a time warp that happens in a strange way, through an old radio from the time before transistors and computers, with beautiful lamps and diodes.  The orphaned son of the fireman father in 1999 gets in contact through this radio with his father in 1969 or about and they try to stop the killer. After discovering he is a cop. And it works, and the past is changed, and the future of that past is changed, hence the past future is no longer what it could have been or should have been and is what we would have liked it to be. Father, son et grand son. Grandfather, father and son. Three generations instead of two and the orphaned son of the second generation no longer being unable to cope with starting the third generation. Typically American: the desire to change the past, the only thing you cannot change. The future? Maybe if you try hard, and yet without any guarantee. But the past, no way, no hope, and yet there is always an American somewhere who is trying and believing Auschwitz can disappear in thin air. But the most difficult part of the film is the constant shifting from one time to another without being very clear all the time where we stand or are. Except that we get confused after a while.

When the movie finally came out on video, I searched the town till I found a copy to rent.  That night, my roommates and I were glued to the screen.  One of my roommates, known for her sociability, actually postponed a phone conversation to catch the end of Frequency.  ""I'm going to have to call you back!"" she cried into the phone.  Of course, I bought the video as soon as I got the chance.

More recently, my husband and I were walking in a store when I found a copy of Frequency on DVD for about $5.  I couldn't believe it and couldn't snap the movie up fast enough!  With its fascinating science fiction aspects, issues of emotion and morality, and spellbinding storyline, this is undoubtedly the best thriller I've ever seen.

The bonus features on the DVD are nice, but the absence of Garth Brooks's music video was palpable on the VHS; the absence continues on this edition.  I'm not sure why the video is missing, but the movie is still a great buy!",1165968000,3,1125,4.289099526066351
1375386,4,B00004YA66,"This is a wonderfully nuanced fantasy flick with a bravura performance by Dennis Quaid who plays the father and a compelling one by Jim Caviezel who plays the son.

Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when he claimed this film to be reminiscent of a Twilight Zone episode. It certainly has that feel to it. The premise here is a simple one. A son, haunted by the premature, though heroic, death of his fire fighter father thirty years earlier, is reunited with him through an old ham radio which had belonged to his father. He finds himself speaking to his father over the air waves, when an aurora borealis-like solar storm provides a conduit into the past.

This connection to the past allows the son to alter the one event which has so profoundly marred his life, that of his father's death. Over the airwaves he tells his father of the fire to which he will be dispatched and of his impending death. He also tells his father what he needs to do in order to avoid his premature demise. The father is dispatched to the fire about which his son has told him and acts upon his son's suggestion, forever altering the future.

This change, however, alters other events, and it results in his mother's premature death at the hands of a serial killer. Father and son now go to work in tandem, each in his own time and way, to try to alter this event, forever changing their respective lives. The son, who is a cop, finds that the case which he has been working on is now the unsolved serial killer case involving his mother.

As the father effects subtle changes in his respective reality, this causes shifts in his son's present day reality. While this may seem a little confusing, it is to be expected when you are dealing with time shifts and the ramificatins of altering past events through future information. Ultimately, this causes an interesting convergence of the past upon the present.

A nice touch to this film is the fact that it takes place in Queens, New York, home of the New York Mets, and both father and son are die hard Mets fans. More specifically, the father's death occurs in 1969, the year in which the New York Mets won the World Series. This will turn out to be a pivotal event in the movie for more reasons than the obvious one. Baseball fans and nostalgia buffs will love its inclusion in the film.

This is a wonderful movie which is sure to both fascinate and tug at your heart strings.",1165190400,,2418,4.471655328798186

But, I had received some Gift Card Movie Tickets, and I couldn't pass this one up.  It was really good!

The thing I loved about this movie compared to other time travel movies, is it allowed different time segments to cross and interfere with each other (sort of like Back to the Future, when Marty's current self was interfering with his past self) etc.  I like seeing the interaction between father and son, both past and present.  It was really entertaining.

Of course we all want a good ending, which this movie has, but the director/writer didn't sacrafice a good story, with lots of loose ends, to accomplish it.  And that's what makes it a good DVD worth repeat viewings  After all, don't you hate when you re-watch an old favorite, only to find its full of holes and open endings  That's very frustrating for somebody like me, who watches the same movie multiple times.

Quaid gives the performance of his career. Caviezel puts on an excellent show in his role. Andre Braugher gives an outstanding performance also. There were a few weak performances, but not many.

It is a well-developed synergy of drama, suspense and thriller.  It is true this film has some science fiction but it is extremely well done and serves to provide the necessary elements to support the rest of the film.  This is by no means a second-rate sci-fi film nor would I classify it as a science fiction film.  In terms of its suspense, let's just say Frequency demands you pay attention just to stay along for the ride.  That's not to say you feel as though you are working to stay involved.  On the contrary, there are moments you forget about your own surroundings and feel you are in NY watching those Amazing Mets.  And be prepared to be observant and attentive.  Those who do will only enjoy the movie even more since it is laced with small nuggets that make you have those ah-ha moments when you happen to weave two or more related events together.  The acting is first cut also.  All to many movies either have one or the other.  But Frequency holds it all together from start to finish.  This is a movie you can watch (and watch again) with your friends and family (not youngsters though) and have something to talk about for days.

It's a movie that you can really never tire of because it's a movie that entertains the delightful question of ""What if?"" We all would like to change things in our pasts. We all have hidden regrets that we would like to change if we could and if we changed that one thing, maybe our whole lives would be different.

But we shouldn't stay in ""What if?"" Maybe the whole point of this movie is to not have regrets about past decisions and past actions, but what can you do today to make your life different tomorrow. Live with courage, with love, with the knowing that something better is just around the corner just waiting for you to accept, embrace, and happily embody.

The screenplay of this movie is extremely tight. There are no flaws to this movie. It is as close to perfect as it comes. The acting is incredible. Even the little kids that play roles in this film are amazing. It is one of those films that punch you in the gut and then gives you the grace to recover during the length of the film.

The song you here in the background throughout the movie is ""Suspicious Minds"" by Elvis, and centers around the World Series with the ""Amazing Mets"".

Normally I'm not into a movie if it's not completely realistic. This movie however, is where I draw the line. The movie's plot does seem a bit unrealistic, but who cares. It's about a guy (Caviezel) who's dad (Quaid), is a firefighter, has been dead since he was a kid.

Anyway, his nephew digs up an old 2 way radio that Caviezel and his brother used to use with their dad as a kid. It sparks some old memories, and he starts to use it. The twist here is that you see the Northern Lights shining outside the night he starts using the radio. So he starts talking to a man, who turns out to be his dead father in the past. It's really intriguing because he tries to change the past, only to find out that it changes more than he could ever imagine. I sincerely believe that you can't change the past without altering other future events. The movie then takes you on an intense suspense ride.

The movie is an intense thriller with tons of emotion. Caviezel and Quaid really deliver great performances in this movie, and I recommend it to anyone who is as sceptical of UNREALISTIC movies as me.",1118793600,,1208,4.364444444444445

It is Science Fiction, Action and Drama all rolled into one. Once it starts, you are pulled in and can't take your eyes off until the credits are rolling!

Jim Caviezel plays a man who while experimenting with his late Dad's Ham radio, actually contacts his Dad (Dennis Quaid), 30 years in the past, because of a Northern Lights phenominon. Together, they change history, while taking viewers on an action filled, emotional ride until the amazing ending!

1375440,5,B00004YA66,"Frequency, brings to the screen the story of a NY police officer who manages to contact his (now dead) father 30 years into the past through an old radio receiver.

There are slight hints of the X-Files, and strong/obvious elements of Timecop (starring Van Damme), so the movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller type of category.

Dennis Quaid, James Caviezel, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

The plot, the setting, the dialogues, and the music, are all WONDERFUL!

Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!

In conclusion, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.",1113091200,,925,5.052631578947368
1375441,4,B00004YA66,"""Frequency"" caught my eye a couple of years ago whenever I saw it on the satellite.  I missed it when it was out in theaters.  I wish I hadn't.  It is a brilliant tale filled with wonder, mystery, fantasy, and baseball.

The story bounds seamlessly between 1999 and 1969, when the aurora borealis cause a tear in time that allows Quaid to talk to his son(Caviezel) via a ham radio.  Caviezel manages to tell his father how he will die and what he must do to avoid it.  The result is a twist and turn of happenings that wouldn't have occurred if Quaid would have died as originally planned.  With new events underway that make significant changes in the lives of the entire family, Quaid and his son begin to work together in order to set time right.  I won't say much more than that about the plot, so that I don't give too much away.

Quaid is solid as the lead character, Frank Sullivan.  Caviezel does a great job as Frank's son, John.  The rest of the cast, especially Andre Braugher, do an excellent job.  The story moves at a good pace and there is plenty of action for folks who crave it.

The science fiction is key to the story, but this feels more like a drama than a sci-fi flick.  Also, the background story that ties the entire film together, the run of the Amazin' Mets of 69, is brilliant to watch unfold(even though the end result is pretty obvious).

I consider this flick a wonderful edition to anyone's collection who enjoys suspenseful drama, science fiction with a little twist, or baseball.

Highly recommended.",1111104000,6,1533,4.48014440433213
1375442,3,B00004YA66,"Frequency is not for family viewing because there is some graphic violent content, but overall it leans very much is the direction of the `general' audience of all ages except for young kids, who maybe would have enjoyed this one better than adults if it toned down the violence (something us adults rarely ask for these days), instead the upped violent content doesn't work that well, nesting in what is at heart Spielberg/Zemeckis family drama come quasi science-fiction twilight zone episode, it is hard to buy it, but it is still equally hard to say that we should not see it, may help you to quit smoking nicotine, given that you see some age sequencing, the make up effects between timelines is quite well done, except in the reverse with Quaid looking a little older than his younger aging makeup suggests (we are getting old now too dude!) Caviezel does the Brooklyn cop-thing as per the book never really that engaging, but then again prefers the human story as opposed to the two part, let's dig up a generational ham radio kit + northern lights outside in the sky = breaks the space time barrier that allows a father fire-fighter to make contact with his cop son in the future as they hope to change a few things like the father's death by fire, a scene which plays out on a helter-skelter for an overdrawn orchestral score, pulling the valves out of your heart, misdirection is met not by the fact that this is exactly the kind of brainy sci-fi we like to see, but the execution was only so-so, the action not bad but the `kid friendly' suspense drawn out at times and not matching because of confusion that the director does not explain and when something we understand does not need explaining, the director gives us a tutorial there instead. There is even a feeling that some parts are a little far-fetched when the film need not be, means blowing up various scenes lessens the impact in the long run, we all like the idea, and maybe if your 11-year-old son was going to steal an adult thriller when you where not looking, Frequency is the kind you would hope he ends up with and not ""Rambo III"", this is solid three star entertainment that I would easily watch instead of ""Alien Vs Predator"" or ""Riddick""(Pitch Black is great). I know this movie has a fan-base and I can see why. My problem is that I have seen movies like ""The Dead Zone"" from David Cronenberg, certainly more adult, but the idea of a psychic instead of a ham radio being the sci-fi part just works out a whole lot better in that 1983 offering. I would recommend Frequency, yeah silly at times by watch it anyway because the feel is there, maybe not the all the brains, watch it with reserves is all I can say, and would certainly tell you to catch ""The Dead Zone"" also, because I feel it is somewhat similar, much older, but a lot better.",1110844800,,2822,4.502923976608187

1375444,5,B00004YA66,"What if you could change the past?  Fireman, John Sullivan did not die in a warehouse fire because of information from his son in the future.  John is a fireman, who takes high risks to save people, in the first scene where John saves a group of workers trapped under a leaking fuel tank; the fuel tanker accident takes place at a road construction project, the tanker is about to explode, electric wires threaten to ignite the fuel, and John must pry open a steel door and carry injuried man out, who later manages to start running just before the explosion.  How does a injured man manage to run out just before the explosion?  John hero courage and valor allow him to escape death from a exploding fuel tanker.

It would seem at first time modification would bring a happy ending, however, the paradox of changing the past to improve the future leaves one reflecting on the complex of time and space.  The movie has some Ham radio humor, as John says, ""we must be talking of the mother of all sun spots.""  In order to go back in time frequency of the radio waves would have to exceed the speed of light.  It seems the radio wave enters a worm hole through a sun spot and emerge out the sunspot in a different time.  So, if space time could wrap around on its self then traveling along the course would take the person back and orth from the past to the future and the future to the past.  The irony of the thought being that the events in the past and future could change the space time topology.

John does not die in the warehouse fire; John manages to find a grain slide and escape down it into the bay below;  John loves his wive and wants to see her immediately; John visits his wife, a nurse, at the hospital; if he had died, she would not have been at the hospital; as, a result she saves a serial killers live, Jack;  John Jr realizes the past has changed an made the future worst;  Jack in the future increased his killings from three to ten;  John Jr tells his father they must stop the killer to save the mother's life;  John Jr discovers that the killer Jack killed his mother a nurse;  John Jr discloses the address and name of the first victim; John is discovered by Jack and loses in a fight with Jack and Jack steals his drivers license; John Jr, uses a finger left by Jack on John's wallet; the finger print is traced to Jack, a dirty cop; Jack has been living off disablity and stacking nurses;  John can not stop Jack and Jack kills the first victim and when John arrives an eye witness places him at the crime scene;  John predicts the outcome of the mets game to his black cop friend; John's wife arrives and the black cop takes her aside to watch the game and tell her John is a suspect in the killings;  this gives Jack a chase to question John at gun point;  Jack wants to know how John knows about him and tries to kill John at the police station;  Jack is interrupted by a fellow officer; this give John a chance to improvise a defense using wires from the fuse box and airconditioning unit;  John manages to electrocute Jack with the wires, start the fire alarms, and manages to escape;  John reverse the tide by gaining access to information about Jack's residence from information in his wallet;  Jack discovers John in his apartment and the shooting starts;  Jack chases John and they end up fighting in the water, John takes a steel bolt to Jacks head and it seems Jack is dead;  John Jr does not understand why the mothers picture has not been restored and tells John something is wrong when suddenly Jack appears in both time periods and attacks;  because John had fixed the ham radio his tools were on the desk and because he was alive, John manages to escape;  John shoots off Jacks right hand which helps John Jr escape the attack by Jack in the future; and the best part is everyone made a ton of money off Yahoo.",1105574400,3,3853,4.334728033472803
1375445,5,B00004YA66,"I had not seen any advance publicity on this movie.  I'm not even sure how I happened to come to watch it the first time.  I just remember how engrossed I became in the movie as the unusual plot unfolded.  There is a sort of science fiction aspect that is handled fairly well and adds to the impact of the movie.  Due to the presence of northern lights, a ham radio is able to travel through time to connect a son and his deceased father.  They come to understand just who they are talking to over the radio and the family history starts going through some radical changes.  The way things change and the suspense involving new twists to the story keep the interest level high through out the movie.  Just when you think the movie is coming to an end, it veers off in a new direction.

This is one of those movies that will appeal to most age groups and was one that my (then) 11-year old son and I enjoyed together.  I liked the use of the 1969 World Series as a backdrop and point of reference in the movie.

1375456,5,B00004YA66,"This review refers to the New Line Plarinum Series DVD edition of ""Frequency""...

I consider a good thriller, one that not only keeps me on the edge of my seat after the first viewing, but one that keeps me there with every viewing. ""Frequency"" is one of those, that no matter how often I watch it, it takes it's hold on me from the first frame and won't let go until the last. It's more then just a thriller though. It's some fabulous Sci-Fi entertainment with great special effects, it's the poignant story of a special bond between father and son, and there's lots of heart pounding action sequences as well. Add to that one fabulous cast including Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel and Andre Braugher, a fresh take on time travel, and you are in for 2 hours of some fine entertainment.

A Police Officer John Sullivan(Caviezel), by a miracle of nature, is able to contact his father, Frank(Quaid), on an old ham radio. The miracle?...The Northern Lights make a rare appearance in New York. What's truly amazing is that his father died thirty years earlier fighting a fire. He is able to change the course of history, by forewarning his father about the tragedy to come. But by changing the course of history, John and Frank may have unleashed an evil chain of events yet to come. They most work together, with the time they have to stop a serial killer.

The DVD is a great buy. The transfer is gorgeuos. A wonderful widescreen presentation that takes in all the action and special effects in brillant colors. It made be viewed with DD5.1 Surround, which brings it all right into your living room, and it also has an option for DD2.0. A ton of features include deleted scenes, a documentary, ""The Science and Technology Behind Frequency"", Commentary, you can isolate the score, and much more(see buying info for complete list of extras). There are subtitles in English, and the snap case unfolds to some production notes and a few scenes from the film. You really get more bang for your buck with this great package.

It's a film that will have your heart racing one moment and the next will evoke a lump in your throat at the touching moments. It's got something for everyone. It's rated PG-13, but parents may want to view it before hand, as some of the scenes are quite violent.

It's A Definate Keeper!....Get the popcorn ready and enjoy...Laurie

Jim Caviezel is great as his cynical, 36-year old son in the parallel 1999 storyline.  The time bridge is well done [willing suspension of disbelief required, but easy here] and the palpable link between father and son -- the son's loss at his father's early death -- is heartbreaking but ultimately life-affirming.

1375460,3,B00004YA66,"Director:  Gregory Hoblit
Cast:  Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel, Andre Braugher, Elizabeth Mitchell, Noah Emmerich.
Running Time:  118 minutes.
Rated PG-13 for language and violence.
Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel both give fine performances in this quirky science-fiction drama that combines ""Back to the Future"" and ""The Field of Dreams"".  The film opens in the year 1969, with fire-fighter Dennis Quaid first introducing the game of baseball (specifically the Amazin' Mets of that season) to his son, John.  Fast-forward to thirty years later, in which John (Caviezel) is a lonesome, washed-ed ex-college baseball great turned cop who stumbles upon his deceased father's old ham radio.
One night, John uses the radio to connect with a man in the area, later discovering that he is talking to his father in the past.  When the father avoids death in a fire that was supposed to take his life, John realizes that he can use this uncanny communication to help him with a serial killer murder case.  The two join forces to change the course of history in order to save the lives of the killer's next victims.
Clever premise certainly works for the most part, although there are some twists that do not seem to fit.  Hoblit uses the theme of baseball as the connecting link between the father and son, which is an overdone aspect in modern film; however, the script is smart and swift, making ""Frequency"" a film worth the while.",1085184000,2,1421,4.891666666666667

I have watched it several times in a few months, and have made a point of lending it out to my friends simply saying 'trust me, you'll enjoy it'. It has come back each time with positive to glowing reviews, and a smile showing each person did enjoy it.
  The script is well thought out! Tell me how many times you've watched a movie that seemed to have been roughed out on a napkin the night before they started filming? The story moves forward with... a couple surprises/twists that fit perfectly into the storyline, but doesn't overshadow the identification with and the developement of the characters. Great casting. I have been a Dennis Quaid fans for over a decade, and Jim Cavieziel was a pleasant discovery for me.
  I missed this in the theatre. Not too many people went to see it. Man, I might have missed it altogther had I not had a few dollars to spend... and in this case, that would have been a bad thing. You'll enjoy it, trust me.",1085011200,5,1085,4.356435643564357

Dennis Quaid plays a heroic fireman and a loving husband and father in the past.  James Caviezel portrays his adult son in the future.  James Caviezel character is tragic, sad because he misses his father who died in a fire when he was young.  The story affords James' character to save Dennis by telling him how he would die and how to avoid it.  How does he communicates with his dead father?  Watch the film.  It's quite simple.

When it came out I don't think it recieved the audience it deserved, but after hearing how good it was I searched it out, as everyone should.  This movie is so well woven, not just a mystery, not just a story of a father connecting with a son, but all this and much more, done in a beautiful, un-campy way.  I would not consider this a ""time travel"" movie, but quite differently one of hope.  Of a man just wishing for a bit more time with his parents, a man searching for some kind of happiness in his life.  Well scripted, well acted, and complete, I highly recommend this movie.
What bothers me is that some reviewers on this page have expressed bluntly that they will not see this film because of the recent role Jim Caviezel has portrayed in the film ""The Passion of the Christ.""  Certainly everyone is entitled to their opinions.  But my heart goes out to these individuals, that they would be so quick to shun, and even criticize a film such as ""Frequency,"" a film that they have not seen, and would miss out on just because they cannot separate the actor from the role.  And to say that Jim Caviezel would bring ""an evil"" (as one reviewer explicitly states) to this film makes me sudder at the closed-mindedness one could posses.  I'm not here to address ""The Passion of the Christ,"" but I will say that by judging blindly, one can miss out on great experiences.",1078876800,9,1410,4.434108527131783

Not only did it keep me on the edge of my seat (which rarely ever happens to me anymore with movies) but the father/son relationship is one of the best I have ever seen in a film and I have seen quite a few that deal with this theme.  Surprisingly due to the sincerity of the performances and the realistic and exciting direction that never seems to let up the time travel angle really works.  Within the context of this world/story it is completely plausible and not in a goofy way like say Back To The Future.  In this story it serves a deeply rooted purpose.  This is a very suspenseful movie and I warn you it can even get a bit scary at times.  Job well done by all that were involved in the making of this movie.,1069977600,3,797,4.203947368421052

The film opens on the eve of the 30 year anniversary of his father's death. John's childhood best friend Gordo( Noah Emmerich) comes over to cheer him up, and they drag out Frank's old ham radio. Due to a phenmenon called an ""aurora borealis"" John soon realizes that he is able to speak to his father Frank thiry years in the past where the same phenomenon is occuring. Since the death of his father has not yet happened, he is able to warn Frank about the accident. However, saving Frank's life also alters the course of a serial killer which effects John's entire family. John's current investigation is the same unsolved case from 30 years before. Now John and Frank work together over the radio to solve the case and avoid the tragedy that happened to their family.
Frequency remains one of my all time favorite movies. The acting is phenomenal!! Jim Caevizel gives the best performance in the movie as John Sullivan. The love for his dad that he shows as well as the determination to solve the case is amazing. Dennis Quade continues to amaze me with his versatile and brilliant roles. Frank Sullivan is no exception. I love the way that he shows love for his son, and how he must become like a cop even though he is a firefighter. Noah Emmerich adds a nice touch to the story with Gordo. A suprising performance was given by Elizabeth Mitchell who plays John's mom Julia. Andre Braugher always does a good job and continues to with Satch. The villan of the story is played by Shawn Doyle. He gives a very impressive performance that will shock you! The story itself is brilliant. It involves many elements. The love between father and son, a murder mystery, and the scientific phenomenon of the aurora borealis. Some timetravel movies suffer with due to lack of explanation. But as the movie goes on, memories of both lives ( the one with Frank dying, and the one with him alive) are shown. You get to see John's life on both timelines, as if they both merged to create the present. This lets us see where the chages were coming from and why they were done.
With amazing performances, an incredible script, and an action packed story, Frequency is a treat to watch. It puts an interesting spin on the time travel genre! The DVD is a must own because you not only get the movie, but great special features. You get to see featurettes, deleted scenes, and much much more",1068681600,3,2548,4.517316017316017

As John and his dad start to change the past, they also alter future events in both good and bad ways.  Can they put things right before they lose their special connection for good?
The idea is unique and stays so throughout.  The underrated and execellent drama/thriller is well written and acted.  The movies deals with several interesting issues, is exciting without falling to the typical thriller antics and is touching without being maudlin.  Definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen.

It's great science fiction in the tradition of the old Outer Limits series.  It really played like an extended Outer Limits or Twilight Zone show, with great character development, suspense and action.  It's also a good mystery!
The plot revolves around strange sunspot activity which makes it possible for a NY City policeman to use a ham radio to talk to his father, a former NY City fireman who died 30 years previously in a fire.  Taking advantage of the opportunity, the son warns the father of his impending death and saves the man's life -- altering forever the future timeline in a strange and HORRIBLE way that the two race through the remaining two-thirds of the film to set right.
The filmmakers try really hard to put current quantum physics explanations for what's going on into the film, using an interview with a physics professor with Dick Cavett on the tele in the background on night... it's subtle, yet obvious to the audience that their conversation has to do with the events unfolding in the narrative.  This of course anchors the film in the realm of science fiction rather than science fantasy or scifi, and gives it an air of suggestible believability that helps propel the plot foreward.
It also has one of the most suspenseful and tense opening action sequences of any film I've seen in recent history -- a definite armrest grabber!  Three solid stars for this entertaining and at times engaging film which at least attempts to deviate from the old cliche' of time travel plots, even if it fails in a few of those attempts.  It's not easily predictable, but once you get a taste for the director's methodology, you'll start figuring things out.  And the film's ending is a bit overly sentimental, with drawn out slo-mo sequences that border on the worst of the old Kodak ""special moments"" tv adverts.",1054425600,2,1937,4.7611940298507465
1375474,5,B00004YA66,"The paradoxes of time travel are enough to convince most people that it is impossible, along with warp drive, transporter beams, and lots of other staples of science fiction.  Still, writers persist in telling time travel stories and we continue to enjoy them, usually because they are about something else besides time travel.  The deciding factor is not the scientific logic of the method of time travel, because ultimately the rationale simply has to be plausible enough to engage our willing suspension of disbelief.  There are many people who enjoyed ""Somewhere in Time"" and that involved Christopher Reeves' character THINKING himself back to the past.  In the end all that matters are two things.  First, that there is a logical consistency to the rules of the game, whatever they might be.  Second, that there is an emotional payoff to the story that is told under these circumstances.  This is why the ""Star Trek"" episode ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" and the very best episodes of ""Quantum Leap"" were so fantastic.
The script for ""Frequency"" written by Toby Emmerich meets both of those criteria.  On the logical consistency axis the twist is to have a time travel story where nobody actually travels through time.  Instead the aurora borealis allows a father, Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) and son, John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) living in the same house in Queens to talk over the same ham radio set despite the difference of thirty years.  On the emotional payoff scale there is the fact that the father died thirty years ago fighting a fire and the son, who was only 6 at the time, is desperate to reach back into the past, not only to save his father's life but to stop his own life from going into the gutter.  Now, that could be an entire movie right there.  But for Emmerich and director Gregory Hoblit that is just the opening act of the story, because no good deed goes unpunished and if the old chestnut about stepping on a butterfly in the age of dinosaurs could chain out and change the fate of humanity you can imagine what the saving of a life accomplishes.  What starts off as a science fiction/fantasy story suddenly becomes a thriller.
I thought the ways the rules of the game were exploited in ""Frequency"" was brilliant from a narrative standpoint.  Of course if you change the past you change the future, but in ""Frequency"" this does not happen instantly from John's perspective.  He can tell the new ""memories"" from the old as things change.  Granted, this is a dramatic device that comes into play big time in the film's climax, but that is why the logical consistency matters more than the scientific and the ending is set up by more subtle examples of the principle at work earlier in the film.  I also like the way that the 1969 World Series was used in this film (I got up in the middle of the night to listen to the games on Armed Forces Radio in Japan that year, so I have strong memories of it as well) and the way that John and his father try to figure out ways of working together to change the past so they have a future.
I never took physics, so I did not having any annoying scientific facts gnawing at my brain while enjoying this film, which may be why I had no problem seeing what happened in this movie as being logically consistent.  I just understood the rules and thoroughly enjoyed the film.  I thought I had the ending pegged, but was pleasantly surprised with what happened instead (however, on the audio commentary by the director Hoblit reveals that the ending he wanted to shoot was the one I envisioned).  For those of little scientific faith there are a series of explanations offered on the added attractions on the disc, which includes the usually deleted and extended scenes, and three audio commentary tracks by (1) the director Hoblit, (2) the writer Toby Emmerich and his brother Noah, who plays Gordo Hersch, John's next door neighbor and best friend; and (3) composer Michael Kamen.  When you do any of those be sure to turn on the trivia captions as well.  This is one of those DVDs where any doubts about rating are erased by the bonus features.
Ultimately, I found ""Frequency"" to be almost as good as the ""Leap Home"" two-part episode of ""Quantum Leap,"" the best time travel story I have ever seen.  That is high praise indeed.  Final Note:  That was not just any episode of ""Hill Street Blues"" on the television that John is watching in his home early in the film but ""Trial by Fury,"" the season premier for the show's third season.  It was not only directed by Hoblit, but was the show that earned the series another Best Drama Emmy and remains one of the Top 10 television episodes I have ever seen in my life.",1052784000,,4684,4.593037214885954

1375479,5,B00004YA66,"The first time I saw this movie, I was amazed.  Well written, well plotted, well acted movies are distressingly rare in Hollywood these days.  But just when you've given up all hope on Hollywood, a movie like ""Frequency"" comes along to change your mind.  In the movie, father and son learn they can communicate over 30 years, to just before the father was killed.  With warning from his son, dad avoids dying in a warehouse fire, and he changes history.  Within the new timeline, however, the wife/mother is killed.  Now father and son must race to protect her, by catching a killer in two time frames at once.
This movie is a solid thriller.  Combining edge-of-your-seat drama and suspence with heartfelt moments, Emmerich and Hoblit weave a wonderful tapestry of film.  The time travel concept, which is difficult to pull off, works wonderfully well, and the filmmakers keep the science perfectly consistent.  Often, inconsistencies can ruin a science fiction film, but ""Frequency"" succeeds admirably in that department.  Dennis Quaid once again proves himself as one of the most under-rated actors in Hollywood.  If you don't believe me, see ""Far From Heaven.""  (2002)  I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
The DVD is full of the usual extras.  Nothing extraordinary, but all the standards are here.  The commentaries are interesting, and the deleted scenes are standard.  The standouts are the documentaries about the science of the film.  All in all, a solid DVD.",1047513600,2,1472,5.016528925619835

More generally it can possibly be interpreted as a tribute to firemen and policemen, which is good. Sometimes however, you will get confused as the past and persent are entwined.",1043366400,,585,4.634615384615385
1375481,4,B00004YA66,"Frequency takes an interesting twist on the concept of time travel.  Nobody actually travels forward or backward in time in this movie.  Instead, a son talks to his now deceased father 30 years in the past over the ham radio because of freakish sun storms that occur exactly 30 years apart.  This makes for an interesting movie as we see a son getting to know the father he lost as a child.
When it comes to movies or television handling the concept of time travel, you have to make two decisions.  One ? does the story set up and adhere to any rules addressing how time travel and the consequences thereof will be governed.  Two ? are your willing to accept these rules.  In Frequency, the rules are that anything that happens 30 years in the past to change events in the future is noticed exactly 30 years later.  For example, when John Sullivan?s father accidentally burns the desk, the burn mark (still warm) appears before John?s eyes who is sitting at the same desk exactly thirty years later.  I found this somewhat annoying, but the rest of the movie was done well enough that I decided to go ahead an accept this.
In the movie, John Sullivan (James Caviezel) talks to his father, Frank, thirty years in the past over the ham radio because of sun storms that occur exactly thirty years apart in 1969 and 1999.  John warns his father that he will die in a fire (Frank is a firefighter), which allows Frank to avoid his untimely demise.  This alters history in ways that lead to John?s mother later being murdered by a serial killer.  John remembers both timelines because he was involved in changing the past (another of the movie?s time travel rules you have to accept).  John warns Frank of what has happened, and they work together to follow the events that lead to Julia Sullivan?s murder in order to alter history once again.
If the plot sounds somewhat convoluted and contrived, it is.  But it is done well enough and provides for a rather entertaining two hours.  The focus is on John and Frank as they reestablish the bond they lost when Frank died thirty years ago.  Dennis Quaid does a good job as Frank Sullivan, almost overshadowing James Caviezel?s performance as John Sullivan.  Quaid is an excellent actor who has unfortunately been cast in more than a few mediocre movies.  In Frequency, though, he is given the material that an actor of his talent deserves.
The DVD version has most of the usual additional features such as comments by the director and writer as well as biographies of the cast.  One of the more interesting of the additional features is a short documentary on the science behind the movie.  It does not provide a completely sound scientific backing to what transpires in the movie (not that you would really expect it to) but it does have some interesting information on how sun storms have affected ham radio transmissions.",1042675200,3,2866,4.639603960396039

1375483,5,B00004YA66,"I fell in love with ""Frequency"" by accident. The film's original promos played up the 'change your destiny' aspect of the plot more than the father-son bond, and I guess I thought there'd be some souped-up DeLorean auto waiting in the wings to whisk characters somewhere every 10 minutes. But this film is nothing like that. I lost my mother sixteen years ago and have only bonded stronger with my dad since then, and as such, really relate to the film's subtler message of re-affirming ties with those you love the most. It doesn't hit immediately. When detective Jim Caviezel first speaks to fireman Dennis Quaid, they are understandably confused and pseudo-annoyed with each other, because they do not yet understand what has happened between them. Later, of course, the 30-year paradox is revealed, and a new relationship emerges after Quaid survives a potentially life-ending fire. The duo-logue which follows between father and son over the ham radio is a breathtaking scene, and when it comes to an end (""I'm almost afraid to turn this off- like we won't get this back""), I'm a tearful mess, every single time. But I *am* smiling.

Taking place over two time zones, and two generations, this film occurs during the 1969 and 1999 Aurora Borealis. In 1969 Frank Sullivan, a NYC firefighter, is killed on the job, leaving a son, John, and wife. 30 years later, in 1999, John now a grown man working for the NYPD, stumbles across his fathers old CB Radio, which John is able to contact his father on in 1969 because of the Aurora Borealis.
John essentially saves his father from his not-yet-occured death, and in turn sets forth a string of murders by a supposedly long dead, nurse murdering, cerial killer. In turn father and son must work together through time to save John's mother as well catch the cerial killer before he continues on his vicious murders.

My friend and I decided we simply had to see it.
To say ""we laughed, we cried"" doesn't quite capture the emotions this movie evokes. Quaid and Caviezel are both wonderful.

As a lifelong Mets fan, I love how they prove they're telling the truth by describing what happened in the 1969 World Series.

I am not a movie person, preferring always to read the book if possible, but I solidly support the rating I give 'Frequency.'

There are many factors in this movie, sci-fi, crime suspense, thriller, drama and time paradox. I think the director managed to handle these various elements deliberately. I had never seen such an acrobatic, but emotional drama.
When John appeared in 1999, I was puzzled about why John was so depressed, almost an alcoholic. But in the progress of the story, I understood that when John lost his father, he lost his spirit and guts, too. I was deeply impressed by the ties that bind father and son together. As John talked to his father and got new memories, he got back his spirit.
Jim Caviezel acted the complicated character well. He didn't over-act, so this movie succeeded as an emotional drama, I think. Dennis Quaid acted the perfect father very well, too. Because of his acting, I could understand that John's life has been so sad without Frank.

1375507,4,B00004YA66,"I think that Frequency's screenwriter, Toby Emmerich, set out to write a rather original sci-fi movie script. This he did, but he also wound up creating something more. Frequency is one of the best stories about the relationship between father and son ever. I can recommend it as a sci-fi thriller. I can highly recommend it as a modern American drama.
As always, I will give you a short plot synopsis, but I must add that, on paper, the story loses something in transition and seems a bit goofy.
John Sullivan [James Caviezel] is a cop who lives in the house he grew up in in New York City's Queens borough. He is a a low point in his life now that his wife has walked out on him. One day he and his best friend Gordo [Noah Emmerich] find an old ham radio that John's deceased Dad owned. One night, during a huge display in the sky by the northern lights, some sort of cosmic disturbance occurs. The fabric of time is altered, and John finds himself talking on the old radio to his father, Frank [Dennis Quaid]. Once both of them determine it is not a hoax, John tells Frank, who is living in 1969, that he would not have died in a warehouse fire if only he had tried to escape the other way. The next day, the anniversary of his death, Frank, a fireman, does turn the other way and survives. Joy soon turns to horror when the men discover that they have inadvertently changed the future. They must work together to prevent an even greater tragedy.
It is in the two's working together that the story takes flight. Father and son are separated by time. All of their interaction takes place through this ham radio, each man sitting at the same desk thirty years apart. The love between the two is so real and so strong that even the hardest of grown men might shed a tear or two while watching the movie. Caviezel is brilliant, and Quaid is better than he has been in years. I think much of the credit goes to director Gregory Hoblit. Most of his experience has been in television, most notably directing episodes of Hill Street Blues and LA Law. His knowledge of the small screen is part of what makes the scenes between father and son so intimate and believable. Also compelling is how each actor seems so much a part of their time. This is a subtle but important difference that only greatly talented people can bring off. Some great performances are also given by Noah Emmerich, Elizabeth Mitchell as Julia Sullivan, Daniel Henson as John at age six, and Shawn Doyle as Jack Shepard, the villain of the movie.
INSIDE SHOTS: Writer Toby Emmerich originally used the idea of a small black hole's causing the time fracture. The studio decided that wasn't filmable enough. Don't blame Emmerich for the illogical substitution of northern lights...",1016409600,2,2745,4.514056224899599
1375508,5,B00004YA66,"""Frequency"", to me, is like two stories in one...the first story is set in 1969 and it describes Frank Sullivan (an outstanding Dennis Quaid), a working-class NY fireman living in Queens with a loving wife (Elizabeth Mitchell) and his son John. The second story is set in 1999, 30 years later. It describes John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel), all grown up and is a police officer, not a firefighter like his father. Basically, John could not get over the fact that Frank, his father, had died in a building fire. John's best friend Gordo (Noah Emmerich) comes across a ham radio inside John's house. The ham radio used to belong to Frank a long time ago, so Gordo urges John to give it a try. And soon enough, the radio works under the different frequencies of the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis. John could not believe it when he is talking to his father, who's been dead for 30 years. As the film goes on, there is a string of murders that are the work of a serial killer. And John in 1999 and Frank in 1969 must team up to prevent these killings from happening again from the results of 30 years ago. Gregory Hoblit (""Primal Fear"", ""Fallen"") directed this film with perfection all the way! ""Frequency"" is so entertaining and so thrilling that it will have you asking the question: ""What if you could go back in time and change the event that altered your life forever?"" This is Dennis Quaid's best performance since ""The Big Easy"" and ""Flesh and Bone"". And this is Jim Caviezel's breakout performance in which he did an excellent job. And the DVD version of ""Frequency"" just couldn't be better, with deleted scenes and more! ""Frequency"" is truly one of the best sci-fi drama-type films ever made.",1014249600,4,1698,4.6072607260726075
1375509,5,B00004YA66,"After seeing the incredible Count of Monte Cristo, I looked up this film costarring Jim Caviezel hoping for an okay flick.  However, it definately exceeded my expectations!!!  Caviezel is John Sullivan, a young cop living in Queens in 1999.  His father (Dennis Quaid in a great performance) Frank was a firefighter who died thirty years ago in a warehouse fire.  However, John is given everyone's dream of getting a second chance to fix the past!! By some strange phenomenon concerning Northern Lights, John is able to talk to Frank in 1969, over his father's old ham radio, and on the eve of his father's death warns him that he will die tomorrow.  Although Frank is unconvinced that the voice on air is his son from the future, he ""goes the other way"" and escapes from the burning warehouse.  Not interested yet?  Because Frank did not die in the fire, his wife, a nurse, accidently saves the life of a serial killer.  Unfortunately, back in 1999, a horrified John discovers that mother has been murdered by the said serial killer in 1969!!!  It's up to John and Frank, in a father-son collaboration, to catch the killer and save their wife/mother before the killer gets to both of them first.  This is really an interesting and absorbing movie, and I guarantee you'll be hooked until the very end!!!*",1014076800,2,1303,4.725663716814159

Something that's never happened to me before.
As someone else mentioned, this is definitely a movie to watch over and over again -- all the subtle details just can't be picked up in one viewing.
Fine performances by all, including Shawn Doyle (the killer), whom I hadn't seen mentioned in the other reviews I read (of course, I didn't read all 160+ reviews!!).

All I'll say is that Frequency contained a few surprises, a lot of heart and solid acting by Dennis Quaid and others. I enjoyed it tremendously -- so much so that I bought the DVD and have watched it three or four times already.
Even though the main focus is the relationship between father and son (separated by 30 years since the death of the father), this movie of the heart doesn't shirk on matters of the head. More scientific in its foundation than Field of Dreams (which simply featured a magic cornfield that enabled the living to interact with the dead), Frequency still manages to make the viewer wonder and wish -- and yearn for second chances with lost loved ones.
If you like your movies to be intelligent, well-acted and able to employ both your heart and your mind, you could do a lot worse than Frequency. I highly recommend it.
If you don't want to take the plunge and outright buy it before you see it, rent it first. However, I think you'll enjoy it enough to want to own it. So just skip the middle step and order it from Amazon today.",1009324800,4,1155,4.401869158878505

So, I kept my eyes open for its release on video, at which point, I snatched it up and brought it home.  I was not disappointed.  This is the kind of movie they just don't make anymore.  Nowadays, you can usually watch a bit of a movie and predict the end.  I tried to do that with Frequency, but it just didn't work.  Every time I THOUGHT I had it figured out, they changed something in the past, which changed something in the future, making my idea of the ending not possible.  I never did guess the ending and was thrilled and surprised when it came.  I was also thrilled to have watched a movie that could keep me in suspense right up to the end, not to mention a movie that was about nice people who loved each other in what some would consider a ""mundane"" lifestyle.  There are no penthouses or personal jets or other typical elements of modern movies.  This is about real people in extraordinary circumstances.
  For those who have lost a parent, this movie is about miracles and wish-fulfillment.  We cheer and cry that these two find each other over the years.  Watching the movie, I didn't like John, the son, much at the beginning, but I watched him soften and become more likeable as he gets to know the father who he lost as a child.

1375518,5,B00004YA66,"The premise for this first-rate thriller involves a New York fireman and New York policeman father and son duo who work together to save lives in both the future and the past.  FREQUENCY is based on the idea of shifts in reality occurring in the present as a direct result of communications over short wave radio between a police detective here in this present time (Jim Caviezel) and his father in the past (Dennis Quaid) during times of heightened solar flare activity.
This movie works because it is internally consistent, even as it stretches one's concept of what can be possible. I enjoyed watching this movie on several levels, as the father and son get to know each other by talking on a ham radio during a spectacular display of northern lights... and race to stop a killer before he strikes again.
I especially enjoyed the way the police detective in the film describes how it feels to have several different memories after reality shifts. In one scene, John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) talks with his dad, Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid), on a ham radio.  John describes how he recalls both the memories of how his father died in a burning warehouse and also the memories of how his dad rescued a woman and emerged unscathed from that same fire.  John says in amazement, ""I remember both... at the same time. It's like waking up from a dream and you're not sure what's real. I remember you being here, but I also remember when you weren't.""

Perhaps it is the presence of Dennis Quaid that makes it feel like an 80's film.  Or maybe it is the changing-past-altering-future time travel concept.  Nevertheless, it's a fun concept to explore, the idea of being able to communicate with somebody from the past through a radio, and thus warning that person in the past, thus altering the events of the present.  This is basically what happens when John, a police detective, finds himself communicating with his presently dead father in the past through a HAM radio and manages to prevent his death.  As a result, it somehow results in a set of serial murders, of which John must try to solve (with a help of his dad).

1375537,5,B00004YA66,"Time travel movies are always hard to pull off, and even though ""Frequency"" leaves a lot of unanswered questions, one cannot deny how effective and touching a film it is.  Buoyed by the fantastic performances of Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel and Elizabeth Mitchell, the story is mesmerizing and thoughtfully executed.  There are several scenes of rare poignancy in depicting the relationship between not only a father and a son, but also a family who truly loves each other.
Hoblit's direction keeps things moving well, as we experience a parallel time type of scenario.  Things going on in 1969 are paralleled with the actions in 1999, and it's unique the way the story shows John acquiring new memories as things change in 1969.
By the end of the movie, my mind was buzzing with questions.  By that time, however, it's not that important.  The ending is so satisfying that you can't help but want to stand up and cheer.
One big crime, though, is the Academy Awards' error in not even nominating the beautiful song, ""When You Come Back to Me Again,"" written by Garth Brooks.  In an era where songs are merely added for padding or to sell soundtracks, this song appropriately supports the whole theme of the story.  What a shame!

1375538,5,B00004YA66,"Considering watching movies to be a waste of time, I very nearly missed this. Mom brought Frequency home from the library one day and told me that it dealt with time travel, with a present person's disruption of the past. ""Oh, how original, ha, ha,"" I thought. Nevertheless, I decided that it could not hurt to watch the beginning, and, after seeing the awe-inspiring auroral activity and hearing it explained in relation to string theory, I thought I'd stick around to see where this film was going. Boy, was I glad I did...
First of all, no time travel, at least in the popularly accepted sense, actually occurs; that is, every character remains in his appropriate time. To be accurate, it is a movie about the synchronism of two plotscapes 30 years distant. As the interact, small changes in the earlier result in a myriad of variations in the later and the intervening decades. I believe that Frequency's theory is valid insofar as events we assume to occur chronologically are actually, if they could be seen from a higher-dimensional perspective (i.e. that of God, certainly incomprehensible to humans!), synchronous. (This is much closer to the view presented in Slaughterhouse 5, though Frequency still relates.) In fact, I accept the idea that given the right circumstances--perhaps a large-scale magnetic storm would play a role--communication between these different times may be possible. However, I also believe that all of time was created with all of space, and that, just as a line stretches out within a plane, everything that has happened and will happen is immutably laid out within this third temporal dimension. Thus, even if inter-time communication were to take place, all of future and past would remain unchanged, for the effects of this interaction have already been ingrained into the grand scheme of time. (On a side note, yes, this does entail predestination; no, that neither precludes free-will nor excuses laziness--but that is another essay in itself.) Unfortunately, this theory does not lend itself well to film.
Well, enough of my philosophical musings. I do hope that this movie will immerse you in such abstruse, mindbending ruminations--and then if anyone ever tells you that you cannot stimulate your mind while staring into a television screen, gainsay them with one word: Frequency. Of course, I suppose that the idea of movie grounded in the abstract reasoning of modern theoretical physics does not titillate everyone. Thus, I ought to mention that this is by no means the entirety of the film. Its gripping, suspenseful tale of murder is sure to keep the viewer enthralled. The climax is one of the most exciting I've seen (though granted, coming from me, that's not saying a whole lot), and the final resolution is great--cool enough that for a moment I forgot how this movie contradicts to my metaphysical ideas. I dare not say more than that, but know that Frequency is a complete film, not one of those movies that leaves the viewer asking, ""That's it?!"" Although the gravity of the murder thriller prevails, the movie does also contain a few humorous touches. For the sentimentalists, it is also a touching story of the relationship between father and son. Furthermore, I must say again that the auroral scenes are spectacular (especially for New York). This movie delights on so many accounts that to reserve two hours for watching it is definitely worthwhile!

1375542,5,B00004YA66,"In Frequency, Dennis Quaid is a firefighter in Queens, in 1969.  His son John, at 6 years of age, dreams of one day becoming a police officer.  Due to some kind of bizarre transgression of the laws of physics, associated with unusually prominent aurora borealis, he and his adult son John find themselves communicating by shortwave radio, from 1969 to 1999, and back.  John saves his fathers life, by warning him about an impending disaster he will face in a burning building.  But somehow, something about this act has changed history, and caused a psychotic killer to continue killing, although in the normal course of events he would have died, thereby ceasing his activities.  Together, Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel must find the killer, and stop him, before he kills their respective wife and mother.
I found this to be quite an enjoyable thriller.  The mere fact of having the father (Quaid) be an incredibly brave fireman, and the son (Caviezel) be a homicide detective, guarantees plenty of action right off the bat.  The shortwave radio is a cool little device, it worked for me.  There are a few scenes where the director shoots slow motion sequences of falling objects from the past and present simultaneously, leaving their synchronicitous moment of impact to imply a change in history.  This was slightly overdone, I thought, but still basically effective.  I really enjoyed some parts of the soundtrack, particularly the song played during the closing credits.  All the supporting actors are very good as well.  Noah Emmerich reprises his trademark role as the protagonists buddy, constantly offering brewskis, which he perfected in The Truman Show, and in Beautiful Girls.
By the way, the physics professor they show being interviewed on television by Dick Cavett, to explain the aurora, is apparently named after a real superstring theorist, named Brian Greene.  Anyone out there who enjoys the science part of this movie, and would like to learn more, should look for Brian Greenes very readable book, The Elegant Universe.

I am a huge fan of the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, but I am well aware of how difficult it is to keep the audience believing and also attentive to detail (important in such suspense classics as ""The Sixth Sense"").  Due to a commitment to consistency by the director Greg Hoblit (except for one blunder explained in the commentary) and phenomenal acting by both Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel, it is easy to stay attached to the plot and feel sympathy for the Sullivan family.  In response to questions in reviews about how Frank beats cancer, you can see him throw away the last pack of cigarettes his wife offers him towards the end.  As far as the DVD goes, the audio commentary is informative and helpful to make realizations you may have missed while watching this underrated thriller.

1375547,5,B00004YA66,"I just saw Frequency and was quite impressed.
Parts of the film sent chills down my spine. Both the casting and the acting were extremely good in this movie. Jim Caveizel (who played the homeless addict in the less-than-stellar Pay It Forward) is perfect for the part here, as is Dennis Quaid for the role of his father.
The film is about a policeman in Queens, NY, whose firefighter dad died in the line of duty when he was six years old (in 1966). Thirty years later, on an October night in 1999, as he is fiddling with his ham radio, the now 36-year-old son hears a voice coming from the radio that is somehow familiar. Unbeknownst to both men at first, his father is on the other ""end,"" and is speaking to him from 1969, the day before he is to be killed in the fire. When the son (""John Sullivan"") figures out that he's speaking to his father, he quickly tells his father about the terrible fire that will occur the next day, and tells him about the fatal mistake his father made 30 years before, in an effort to prevent the tragedy and save his father's life. Luckily, the plan works, and the Senior Sullivan (""Frank""), changes his actions accordingly on the day of the blaze and survives the fire. Unfortunately, the fact of his survival changes things beyond either of their imaginations. Everything the father does now that he is alive will affect everything else, since he ""wasn't supposed to be there."" This is an interesting part of the film, because I'm sure people often think, ""what if I/they had done that instead, where would I be now?...what impact would that have had on the world, or on other people's lives.... would I have met my spouse/been in an accident/avoided an accident?"" etc, etc...
A parallel storyline is that John (the son) is working on a case involving a serial killer who goes after nurses (the ""Nightingale Murders,"" they're called). But after he saves his father's life, his mother (a nurse) suddenly disappears from the family pictures... and he has to find a way to save both her (in the past, through communicating with his father) and any other of the serial killer's victims, (and also figure out the identity and whereabouts of the killer, in order to save them). The plot may sound a bit silly and outlandish in such a brief description, but the actors and the details play this out so well that it becomes a riveting, suspenseful film. The film makes up for any deficiencies in the realism (of radio time-travel) with an engaging story, lots of well-paced action, and characters who are played so well that you care what happens to them, and want it to be good. It is an interesting journey into ""what-if's,"" and even though those of us who have lost a parent may cry for a second at the end when that soft, country song plays, we will be better for the experience of the film, as it is a nice story (ie: the idea of being able to see the loved ones we have lost again and live with them, side-by-side again and do the things we always did together), nicely told. The film offers a loving portrait of a father-son relationship. Some nice flashback images of John's childhood with his father (and mother and best friend, who we also see as older adults) complete the picture, making it watchable and endearing without being sappy or overly sentimental. Plus, the idea of the father and son team solving a case together as age contemporaries but in different ""times/eras"" was a new spin on an old formula, and I found it really interesting. Each storyline (the son who lost his father and was still grieving thirty years later, and the crime story), had enough good material for two solid, separate movies. Together, they create a really memorable, enjoyable movie experience. Another bonus here is the lack of real violence. I found it refreshing to see a thriller that was so suspenseful and entertaining and thought-provoking that it didn't have to rely on mindless violence to get its point across. Violence wouldn't have added to the story, and without it, the story sets itself apart from other films in the same genre with a more humanist, sensitive approach. The film definetely shines in that regard. This is also a movie that baseball fans will appreciate, as it has some interesting scenes involving the son foretelling some future (for the father) games.
As far as overall mood and tone go, the nearest film I can think of (the most similar) is the excellent The Sixth Sense. This movie is like that film, but without the ghosts.
The DVD features background data on phenomena such as Aurora Borealis (the Northern Lights), Ham Radios, and the influence of solar events on such radio frequencies.

1375552,4,B00004YA66,"I'll admit, when I first read reviews of 'Frequency' it didn't appeal at all, as always with the sci-fi genre, I dismissed it as a boring, plotless movie. However when faced with a 9 hour flight and an absolutely dire selection of movies I chose to watch this and discovered it was a lot deeper than your average sci-fi. First of all, it had a story, and a good one at that. Second of all I found it completely gripping and I was so tense. You find yourself willing Dennis Quaid, who plays the father, to survive the fire, and your heart plummets when you discover that other members of the family are in danger and pass through various other crises and have to be helped via a ham radio connection to the future, which is in fact the present day. Confused? Don't worry, I don't blame you, but I promise that when you watch this DVD all will become crystal clear because despite its seemingly compilcated storyline the movie is very easy to follow. I think that the aspect of this movie that differentiates it from normal sci-fi is the fact that entwined in, and, inextricably linked to the somewhat spooky story is a development of a father-son relationship, in some respects similar to 'Field of Dreams'. It is this which makes the movie what it is for sure. Although there is immense tension, at times bordering on fear, 'Frequency' has the substance that many films of this genre lack. Therein lies the success. If you don't get what I mean from this review, which, judging by what I've written is highly likely, don't worry, as you will probably understand me once you have seen this DVD, so get watching!",985132800,3,1610,4.536082474226804

I can't help but comparing this film to the 80's blockbuster trilogy ""Back to the Future"" although the underlying theme here is somewhat darker. It is competently directed, and holds the viewer's attention from beginning to end. It is a film worth having not only because of the performances from the lead actors, but also because of the very interesting use of imagery in it, and the attention to detail it shows. I believe it demands repeated viewings so you don't miss significant little tidbits here and there.

It's a flip comment, but it actually gets to the core of the movie pretty well.  There's the exploration of the father-and-son relationship between Frank and John Sullivan across the decades (and the fact that Quaid and Caviezel can put that relationship across without appearing together on screen is quite the accomplishment), and there's the cop-suspense story about the hunt for a serial killer preying on women.  The stories are handled with care, and for the most part the script does a good job of establishing the rules of its fantastic premise and sticking with them.  (There are a few slipups, as the screenwriter notes on one of the two commentary tracks.)  Stories that involve altering the timestream almost always end up sinking under the weight of paradoxes, and Frequency does to an extent, but for the most part the film holds up.  And because it has that emotional core to fall back on, one or two imperfections in the plot can't detract from it.
I'd give the movie itself 4 stars; the fifth comes from all the extras that New Line packs onto this disc, including two commentaries, a copy of the shooting script, and various storyboards and other effects info.  This one is worth spending some time with.",983577600,2,1375,4.8008474576271185

This movie was a sleeper, but should have been a blockbuster. Though the cast consisted of mainly unknown actors save Dennis Quaid, the story is solid, character development is excellent and the action is well done. Quaid and James Caviezel did a great job with their characters - the father/son relationship. The supporting actors did a good job too. One thing that was excellently done was the handling of temporal discrepancies that arise from stories involving time travel or alternate universes. Minute details are carefully shown, and in different instances questions that the audience might have are explained. Everything holds together. The ending was incredible, one of the few movies that kept me guessing until the end. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie in the theater, and again on DVD. Now regarding the DVD, I think everyone should go buy this movie after reading this because it's too good to not have in your library.

As an adult woman whose father passed away when I was 11 years old, I can more than understand John's heartbreaking ache for the father he lost too young, even after thirty years. The characters blend well together and are believable but the most precious moment, for me, is the ending at the old ballpark. For those who have seen it youo might agree that coupled with the song by Garth Brooks, this scene brings tears to my eyes and an ache to my heart everytime.

Luckily I have Finally seen the most Underated movie of 2000. It's a pity that it hasn't been noticed or even thought of for an Oscar hunt.  Frequency really makes you think about the past and the future, and what someone could do to change or alter them both.  I read the back of the box recently and it puts it plain and simple, It reads "" What if you could reach back into time and change the one event that forever altered your life? Would you do it?

1375581,5,B00004YA66,"How best to describe ""Frequency,"" one of the most pleasing and interesting films I've seen in a long time?
To start with, it gives a fresh and fascinating approach to time travel.  It stars Dennis Quaid and lesser-known James Caviezel as father and son.  To sum up the story, some sort of phenomena allows father and son to communicate through time over an old CB radio.
The film is simultaneaously heart-warming and fascinating.  It's part murder-mystery suspense that will keep you guessing 'til the end on a thrilling roller-coaster ride, and it's also part science fiction that will leave you pondering circumstance and chance & make you wonder how the small decisions you make in life ultimately effect the timeline, and it's also a good old-fashioned story of family and love and baseball that will make you feel like the American Dream is a real thing and not just an ideal of the past.
""Frequency"" is simply a wonderful film that is sure to please all types of viewers.  It is emotionally satisfying, with a nail-biting and intelligently written plot, and enough action to please mainstream audiences.
With that said, go watch the movie.  I don't want to give any more away.  It's a wonderful, brilliant movie, and the DVD itself is fabulous.",981504000,,1250,4.845070422535211

Apart from loving Dennis Quaid, who puts in a great performance, I like this film for its unabashed good storytelling. It is tense because it allows us to grow incredibly involved with the characters. Moreover, apart from the usual coincidence thing, the science fiction plot doesn't have holes. May you enjoy this movie as much as I did!",981158400,,402,4.757142857142857
1375583,4,B00004YA66,"The year 2000 was a banner year for New Line Cinema, with the releases of such successful movies as the science fiction thriller ""The Cell"" and the horror film ""Final Destination."" One of the movies among this group of terrific releases is ""Frequency,"" which takes a scientific occurence and turns it into a genuine thriller with tons of surprises and twists. With a truly original plot and a cast of superb actors, this is as good as thrillers get.
Police officer John Sullivan is having a tough spot in life. He can't stop thinking about his father, who died thirty years ago when he was a small child. Being a firefighter, Frank Sullivan cares for his wife and kids as much as any husband and father can, so when someone starts using the same frequency as he is on his ham radio, he becomes even more freaked out when he starts realizing that he is talking to his son who is 30 years in the future. Likewise, John is also confused yet exhilarated that he has the chance to talk to his father, and when he gives Frank a piece of information that saves his life, newspapers and family photos magically transform to show his life prolonged until the 80's. However, when a string of murders is set in motion in 1969, Frank and John must work together to catch the murderer before he can reach his next victim: Frank's wife and John's mother.
If you think this all sounds confusing, believe me, the only confusing thing about it is trying to think of how to write a synopsis of it. It's not that difficult to comprehend, and while it is not over-simplified, everything is pretty straightforward and understandable. The audience will be able to tell the two time periods about by either looking for the characters' age and appearance, or by the sweeping shots of the aurora borealis, which serves as the link that connects father and son on the radio.
Being a student of science, I think I can speak accurately in saying that the science behind the movie is very precise and careful not to stretch credulity. The whole idea for the connection is based on the aurora borealis, or northern lights, which are particles from the sun hitting the surface of Earth's atmosphere, causing interference in most broadcasts and transmissions. The idea that some of those particles can carry transmissions from the past is perfectly fitting for the movie, and hardly makes it not worth watching.
The film has an incredibly high amount of intense action and suspense, especially in the second half. Most notably is the sequence in which Frank is caught in the burning building and must make a decision as to where he must go to get out. Most pessimists out there will shrug this scene off with the notion, ""Oh, he's going to live because there's another hour of movie to go."" But don't say I didn't warn you if you don't find yourself on the edge of your seat the whole way through.
Casting for this movie was a big plus, one of the better ensembles I've seen for a movie like this. It works because everyone fits, molded to the roles they play. Dennis Quaid's performance as Frank Sullivan is incredible, and since he is most of the movie's life force, he carries it off in a fashion that makes the tension even tighter. John Caviezel plays John Sullivan, the slightly emotional and yet smart police officer and grown son of Frank. His acting really brings out the character's strength and heroicism. Because I don't want to ruin the ending for you, I'm not going to mention the actor who plays the villian, but I can say that he is the true embodiment of a movie villain: dark, sinister, and a slick character when faced with possible defeat.
The thriller genre is becoming quite tired these days with the same old plot and character development, and it's quite a refreshment to watch ""Frequency."" A terrific action piece and even a family film by most standards, you'll find it to be quite original, entertaining, and thrilling in all the right places.",980553600,3,3938,4.627142857142857

As a result, their contact results in a trigger effect of events that will affect both their lives and they've got to do something about it. My mother said she loved the film because it's about the bond between a father and son. Everyone I've talked to has something positive to say about ""Frequency"" and when I finally saw it, I loved it. It touches on the subject of father and son working as a team and trying to race against time. One review said ""Frequency"" is finally an excuse for grown men to cry because of it's story. ""Frequency"" is definitely a film you should see with your dad and your mom regardless because it's a very touching film that tugs the heart strings.

1375585,4,B00004YA66,"This is a wonderfully nuanced fantasy flick with a bravura performance by Dennis Quaid who plays the father and a compelling one by Jim Caviezel who plays the son.
Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when he claimed this film to be reminiscent of a Twilight Zone episode. It certainly has that feel to it. The premise here is a simple one. A son, haunted by the premature, though heroic, death of his fire fighter father thirty years earlier, is reunited with him through an old ham radio which had belonged to his father. He finds himself speaking to his father over the air waves, when an aurora borealis-like solar storm provides a conduit into the past.
This connection to the past allows the son to alter the one event which has so profoundly marred his life, that of his father's death. Over the airwaves he tells his father of the fire to which he will be dispatched and of his impending death. He also tells his father what he needs to do in order to avoid his premature demise. The father is dispatched to the fire about which his son has told him and acts upon his son's suggestion, forever altering the future.
This change, however, alters other events, and it results in his mother's premature death at the hands of a serial killer. Father and son now go to work in tandem, each in his own time and way, to try to alter this event, forever changing their respective lives. The son, who is a cop, finds that the case which he has been working on is now the unsolved serial killer case involving his mother.
As the father effects subtle changes in his respective reality, this causes shifts in his son's present day reality. While this may seem a little confusing, it is to be expected when you are dealing with time shifts and the ramificatins of altering past events through future information. Ultimately, this causes an interesting convergence of the past upon the present.
A nice touch to this film is the fact that it takes place in Queens, New York, home of the New York Mets, and both father and son are die hard Mets fans. More specifically, the father's death occurs in 1969, the year in which the New York Mets won the World Series. This will turn out to be a pivotal event in the movie for more reasons than the obvious one. Baseball fans and nostalgia buffs will love its inclusion in the film.

1375586,3,B00004YA66,"Synopsis: Communication is re-established between family members separated by 30 years and an untimely, heroic death. By the use of a HAM radio and coincidental flaring of major sun spots/flares a father and son are granted a reunion. The question is: ""If you have the chance to alter the past for your own betterment do you worry about reprecussions, if any, in the present/future?""
As much as this story tries to make Dennis Quaid out to the leading man/hero type I'm afraid he's lost a little bit of his luster in my eyes. He's not collecting social security or anything, but he doesn't have the same spunk that we're used to him having in his last good movie....say ""Innerspace"",""D.O.A"" or ""The Big Easy"" at least a five years ago.
As predictable as this movie could have been there were enough mind traps and confusion between simultaneous parallel dimensions and time warps to throw off anybody in this twist-of-a- twister. If you've seen ""Dead Again!"" and a few episodes of Quantam Leap I think you'd get the jist of this movie pretty quick.
Myself, not being a huge fan of a twist-on-a- twisters I do appreciate the one quality this type of thriller possesses. Things can get so intermingled that just about anything is possible and there can be one of a hundred possible endings.
With that I leave it up to you to decide...suitable for any age probably 15 or above as it does get a bit complicated. The acting was decent although not stellar.
I give it a C (73/100)because it's been done before. I've seen worse. If you've seen ""Dead Again!"" and liked it you'll probably like this movie. Conversely, if you see/have seen this and liked it you would love ""Dead Again!"". Better acting and even stranger twist.
DVD Special features: There are two commentaries(neither of which I listened to because it's a school night - one by the director and one by the screen writer and an actor).
There is a brief chronological progression of the animation at the start of the movie. This is kind of trivial because I didn't give it a second thought at the time. 4 progression last less than a minute with almost no explanation.
Lastly, there is some science behind the feasability of parellel dimension/time travel stuff. I'm sure it was fascinating, but like I said...it's a school night. Actor bios and filmographies are also included",978912000,,2331,4.74384236453202

I think that is why you see a few negative reviews on this site and others, and I am incredibly disheartened by what they have to say.
""We all know that time travel is not possible....""- one review says. Well actually it IS theoretically possible, but that is not the point. More than that, though, if you are that much of a skeptic, why are you seeing a movie about a man who is able to communicate with his father, who has been dead for 30 years?

But this one really surprised me. Whether the premise is believeable is not even an issue here since the goals of the film are loftier. It's really about family, specifically the relationship that could have been between a father and son, and heavier theme of the consequences of our actions, even down to whether we take one hallway or another. It does make you think.
As for the entertainment value, the scene near the end of the movie where good and bad guys meet is very suspenseful, though it does stretch the imagination a bit (ooh, the hand!). The characters, specifically Dad as played by an always entertaining Dennis Quaid, are endearing and you want to see this family together. In the end, the film does not disappoint.  James Caviezel does justice to the adult son who drinks too much and could have used a bit of wisdom he never got from his Dad.

While the movie was based on a good idea, and it had some exciting moments, the script left something to be desired. The picture perfect ending is what completely ruined the movie for me (just like the ending to the Waterboy). Michael Eisner had to be involved. There were some good scenes, especially when Quaid finds a way to escape the fire and when James Caviesel escapes from the Police Interrogation room, but other than that the movie goes on with unexplained events and unestablished relationships between characters (what ever happened to his live-in girlfiend?).

You keep saying to yourself ""If only I would have done that differently.""  You start wondering what the effect of your past has made on the present and the future.  Frequency is a good family movie.  The characters are believable and the acting is great.  The movie is a little unbelievable at times but of course the whole premise is pretty unique.  I was afraid at the end that is was going to turn into something that we tend to see in a lot of action movies with the chase schenes and all of that.  But it didn't.

1375621,4,B00004YA66,"Voices travelling across time, murder mystery, father and son reunions, aurora borealous....if you are willing to forgive the cheese that comes with this ham radio, you'll have yourself a fine time.
Frequency isn't the most original thing I have ever seen - it uses a variety of pretty average themes, but pulls them altogether in an interesting way that makes the movie much less predictable and even exciting
Though the father-son meeting across the time barrier is not the newest idea (but still a pretty cool one), the usage of these two characters to solve murders of the past so that they can find the murderer in the present to stop him in the past (I know it sounds kind of confusing, but it is extremely well communicated throughout the story) is interesting and suspenseful. And the story moves nicely throughout the movie, with few dull spots. However, when dealing with the heart-tugging subject of a father and son who meet under extraordinary circumstance, you have to expect some sappy and cheesy moments. The less sentimental will laugh at the corniness, but the scenes are undoubtedly moving for all around me I could hear the sniffles of grown men and women alike.
Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel are adorable together as the father and son crime solvers that tug on your heart strings, evoking compassion from the audience even in their weaker moments. The supporting cast is one to be commended, for they are full of flavor and humanity and deliver some choice lines. All together, a strong cast that livens up and adds character to a potentially tired story.
While this is not the most original movie to come out this year, it is still a good watch. There is enough drama to keep you emotionally invovled, and enough suspense to make me frightened when I walked home at night.....But I'll warn you that if you have an aversion to pure sentimental cheese, leave before the Garth Brooks song starts and the credits begin to role.",976579200,6,1948,4.783382789317508
1375622,5,B00004YA66,"This is one of those movies that surprised both me and my wife in a very pleasant way.
Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel are father and son seperated by the father's death some 30 years earlier.  Through a freak solar and atmospheric occurence, they are able to communicate through time via the father's short-wave radio.
Seeing the father with his son, as a 6-year old, in 1969 and their interaction 30 years later, is wonderful to watch.  What starts as a touching reunion turns into a taut thriller as the son realizes that his interaction with his father has caused tragic and unexpected results.
The question that comes to mind is this.  If you could save a loved one, would you do it if the result meant things about your life (or other people's) might change, for better or worse?
Dennis Quaid plays the working class, NY fireman as both loving and a bit hard-nosed.  James Caviezel is great to watch as the son who has grown into a man who is not what he or his father envisioned, but who has a chance to redeem himself.  If you have children, many of the situations will tug at your heart, but this movie is not pandering to your base emotions.  It shows the paths that each life takes based on decisions and fate and makes you think about what is in store for each of us.
Some plot issues are glossed over a bit, but they do not interfere with the enjoyment of the film.  The setting in the middle-class New York neighborhood gives a nice feel to the film and it is nice to see a movie that can show gritty realism and heart-warming interaction in the same two hours.
The video transfer of this DVD is very good and the audio will have you looking over your shoulder if you have a surround sound system.  There are quite a few extras to sift through as well.

This is one helluva spectacular sci-fi/murder mystery thriller sure to capture the attention of even those viewers who despise science-fiction or find movies dealing with time too perplexing. The key to understanding and appreciating this one is too pay very close attention to details throughout the film. The rest is easy to follow and comprehend.
If anyone was given a second chance to re-write their past and that of others to bring back a loved one,despite the multitude of alternate consequences that could occur,would they do it ? That's exactly the basis for this film. However, detective John Sullivan did not realize just how grave the consequences would become after doing just that by using his deceased father's ham-wave radio! From here on the real ride takes flight with several unsolved serial killings intertwined ! No pun intended, but time is of the essence in catching the killer and righting a wrong...
This is one of the first time altering sci- fi movies that can pull at the viewer's emotions or heartstrings when you realize that most of us in a heartbeat would love to have another chance with our dearly departed. The acting by Dennis Quaid is a genuine stellar performance. Jim Caviezel portrays his role perfectly as a man still emotionally and psychologically haunted by his father's death. His character walks through life in a half-awake,depressed, somber state while letting others sort of trample on him.
Every aspect of this film with regards to story,acting,effects are astonishing ! Give yourselves a second chance and rent or buy this dvd;It may be a keeper in your movie collection...",976060800,6,1690,5.039285714285715
1375626,3,B00004YA66,"""Frequency"" might be classified as science fiction, if only because of its basic premise:  that a particularly violent episode of sunspots links October of 1969 with October of 1999, or at least, allows a young Queens cop in 1999 to communicate with his father in 1969 by way of a single ham radio.  The father had died in a warehouse fire in, you guessed it, October of 1969, and after heeding his son's warning, the timeline is irrevocably altered.  The complications that ensue from that alteration, and the attempts of father and son to make right what they have made wrong, comprise the bulk of the film.  On a different level, we are treated to a family-friendly vision of life in the city, of the bond between father and son, etc. etc.
The premise would be more attractive, and the story more engaging, if the film didn't degenerate into typical Hollywood fare.  For example, the father is not only a New York firefighter, but also a heedlessly courageous, manly, all-American firefighter whose daring exploits are worthy of slow-motion camera work.  After avoiding his death in the warehouse fire, the ""complications"" that ensue involve the survival of a serial killer who would otherwise have died with only three victims to his credit--and if there is any more overdone and hackneyed criminal premise in movies today, the serial killer would have to be it.
Notwithstanding these disappointments, the inevitable paradoxes of tampering with the past are not resolved very well in this film; as a result of his communications with his father, the son finds that all the world has changed, excepting his memories, which now include not one but _both_ timelines.  As the action resolutely approaches the climax, the holes in the plot become bigger and bigger.  The willing suspension of disbelief required to remain fully immersed in this film, and not head-shakingly outside of it, was more than I was able to manage.  If you do not have such logical requirements, and if typical Hollywood action fare and trite plot elements don't bother you, ""Frequency"" is worth seeing.",975974400,,2078,4.948275862068965

The father's survival then sets off a series of events which includes interaction with a serial killer.

1375647,4,B00004YA66,"So what would you do if you could communicate with your father thirty years in the past one day before he is killed? Would you warn him? And if you did, would he believe you? This is the dilemma for John Sullivan, (Jim Caviezel) a thirty-something Queens detective who has spent the last thirty years lamenting the loss of his fire fighting father (played by Dennis Quaid). Through some vaguely explained phenomenon they begin to talk through time over his dad's old ham radio. As they talk, and the reality of his fathers looming demise sets in, John warns his father about event that are about to unfold. Skeptical at first, John's father Frank, quickly becomes a believer. Franks escapes the terrible fire, but the repercussions on the future are shocking and unexpected. I won't tell you what these repercussions are, but I will tell you they are very interesting and thought provoking.
""Frequency"" does a good job of exploring the ""what if"" factor, but also stresses the ""No man should know too much about his future."" princible. Quaid and Caviezel develop a pretty good chemistry as father and son, and the emotion between them seems real enough. (Though the New York accents seem a little too thick at times) I have two problems with ""Frequency""; the first is that it takes a little too long to get going which is a product of such a far-fetched story. It takes a lot of up front information to get the audience up to speed. But having said that, once the story does take off it keeps you interested. The second is just a couple of time line inconsistencies that I had trouble explaining, but then again maybe that's just me. All things considered, I did like and enjoy the movie, and even more the second time I watched it. If you do watch this film I would recommend watching it twice.

It explores a familiar theme--i.e. what would be the consequences of changing the past, but with a unique twist I think.

1375676,5,B00004YA66,"This highly imaginative science fiction thriller is an entertaining mind bender of a film.  Toby Emmerich's story takes a fresh approach to the time travel angle.  Rather than having people traveling through time, Emmerich has them communicating through time using a Ham Radio that has been augmented by an Aurora Borealis.  Ok, there aren't many Aurora Borealis events as far south as New York City, but there isn't any trans-time communication noted in the scientific literature either, so we need to allow the story a little latitude.
After we accept the premise, this ingenious plot incorporates many different elements to entice the viewer.  There is the human angle of a son speaking to his dead father, the many twists resulting from altering the ribbon of time, and the solving of a thirty-year-old serial murder case.  The various elements are combined effectively by director Gregory Hoblit (Primal Fear, Fallen) to produce a fast paced action thriller with sufficient character development to bind us emotionally to the characters.  The fascinating thing about the detective story is that the facts of the crime keep changing in unexpected ways each time John (James Caviezel) imparts something to his father (Dennis Quaid) that causes him to change history.  In addition, the action sequences are well done and the visual effects, especially the digitized Aurora are nicely rendered.  The aging makeup is also realistic.
The acting was excellent as well, though the New York accents were pretty bad.  Dennis Quaid alternated between the goofy and endearing dad and the action hero, and managed to keep it from seeming incongruous.  This was a breakout performance by James Caviezel, who heretofore has been confined to minor roles.  His was a very emotional and tense role and he handled it extremely well.  I was also impressed with Elizabeth Mitchell who gave a vivacious performance as John's mother.
I enjoy a good intelligent science fiction thriller.  Lately, science fiction has been subsumed into the horror category, since you seldom see a science fiction story that isn't an excuse to hack up some cast members.  This film was more in the tradition of Twilight Zone, relying more on an inventive story than grisly effects to capture the audience.  That's why I rated this film a 9/10.

A friend of mine, a mystery film aficionado, stated flatly after her first viewing that ""Frequency"" is the best mystery film she has ever seen.  This is a lady who grooves on Hitchcock, Agatha Christie, Hercule Poirot and the like and who usually disdains science fiction.  High praise for ""Frequency"" indeed.
I could not get into some of the special features on the DVD.  I don't know if the problem was with the DVD itself or my DVD player.  I wonder if others have had a similar problem.",974073600,5,995,4.464088397790055
1375681,3,B00004YA66,"A relatively intelligent sci-fi thriller that in the end doesn't really amount to much, ""Frequency"" emerges as a father/son reconciliation drama with a ""Twilight Zone"" twist.  Written by Toby Emmerich and directed by Gregory Hoblit, the film stars Dennis Quaid as a New York firefighter in 1969 who manages, through some fluke of nature, to contact his very own son, Johnny (Jim Caviezel), via short wave radio, thirty years in the future.  The filmmakers manage to come up with a surprisingly large number of narrative twists and turns to keep this potentially one-note premise intriguing and interesting as father and son come to know each other across the normally uncrossable chasm of time.  For instance, Johnny not only has to try to reverse history and prevent his father's untimely death in a fire in 1969, but also to thwart the murders of his mother and of several other women by a serial killer during that same time period.
A film like ""Frequency"" really doesn't have much going for it but the ingenuity of its plot.  Whenever it tries to get meaningful and touching, particularly in its exploration of the father/son relationship, the film dissolves in a puddle of hopelessly contrived and manufactured sentimentality.  On the other hand, ""Frequency"" does manage to keep to a minimum the maddening inconsistencies and lapses in logic that invariably accompany these time-bending scenarios.  Moreover, the filmmakers make clever use of the famous 1969 World Series, astutely finding ways to incorporate it into the fabric of the drama.  On a trivial level, the film does seem to suffer from an apparent oversight on the part of its makers.  The movie is supposed to be set in New York City in the Octobers of 1969 and 1999 - yet, correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't at least some of the trees be turning colors and dropping leaves by that time?  As far as we can tell, the movie seems to have been filmed during the summer months.  For a film whose very foundation is to question the very nature of time, this seemingly insignificant error looms larger than it perhaps otherwise might.
A film of this sort really doesn't stand up to too close scrutiny.  A viewer either accepts the incredibility of the premise and goes with it, or rejects the concept out of hand and moves on to another film.  Suffice it to say then that, given its fundamental plot-is-everything nature, ""Frequency"" makes for reasonably diverting and absorbing viewing.",973987200,3,2452,4.896135265700483
1375682,5,B00004YA66,"I bought Frequency last week on DVD and didn't know what to expect. But I wasn't disappointed. This movie is absolutely fantastic. It's a suspenseful thriller with a touch of family-feeling and the question of wether or not you should change the past. This may sound a little old-fashioned but it's not. This is one of the movies I will remember for a long time and watch for many, many times. Again, and again, and again...",973900800,,424,4.592105263157895
1375683,2,B00004YA66,"whatever these reviewers are on, I want some. This movie dragged. I kept waiting for something cool to happen, but they just kept talking to eachother over the mic-bla bla bla blaaa. I wouldn't know if the conversation was good because I just fastforwarded all of it after a while. A real bore.",973728000,4,294,4.566037735849057
1375684,5,B00004YA66,"Have you ever thought to yourself what if I did ""this"" differently in life or what if ""this person"" was still living, how could my life be now?? Well, this movie will answer your question! This is a very well done movie that all can enjoy! Also, there isn't alot of foul language to kill the movie (like many movies out there). Just when you think you have figured out what is going to happen everything changes. So it definately keeps your attention!! I can't wait to watch it again!!",973555200,4,485,4.4
1375695,5,B00004YA66,"This movie is fantastic. I watched it in theaters, and on video, and you just keep noticing more and more details that add to the movie, rather than detract. The story is about a cop in 1999 who finds a ham radio, but when he starts talking on it, he finds out he is communicating with his father (who has been dead thirty years). It turns out that he is talking with his father across time, and in the past, it is the day before his father was supposed to die. So the cop in 1999 (named John) decides to warn his father, and repercussions occur in what makes for a very suspenseful and very cool movie.
 The acting is good, with strong performances by Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel, and also the actress who plays John's mother (I can't remember her name at the moment). But there is also some top-notch technicality in this movie. In my opinion, if nothing else, this film deserves an Oscar nod for two features: Best Film Editing and Best Director. See if the movie does not have you on the edge of your seat, especially when you get to the climactic ending. I won't spoil anything, but believe me, you are wide-eyed with your mouth hanging open in shock.
 And for a side note, the film also contains the following: a few scattered swear words, including the ""s"" word, SOB, the ""d"" word, ""heck,"" and others. There isn't any sexual innuendos or references, but we do see (very, very briefly) a few pictures of women who have been murdered, and are just clother in a lingerie top and a skirt. It isn't entirely clear in the movie whether the women were raped or not, but it's likely.  Personally, I thought it was a great movie, with terrific suspense, and even some good drama. I highly recommend it (as the rating implies though, for ages 13 and up).",973468800,11,1753,4.404320987654321

1375698,5,B00004YA66,"This movie has it all - action, drama, suspense, and emotion.  I have never been touched so deeply by a movie.  It is definitely worth buying and watching over and over again.  Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel, along with the rest of the cast, were excellent.  This movie was highly underrated and did not get the level of advertisement it deserved.  By far the best movie of the year!",973382400,,384,4.507246376811594
1375699,5,B00004YA66,"I am 14 years old, and I may be a little young for a movie critic.  But take my word for it, Frequency is one of the best movies I've ever seen!  I saw it in a hotel in Phlidelphia, when my parents and sister had nothing really to do.  So we ordered this movie for $9.99.  But, whoa, this movie is worth far more than 10 bucks!  It's a brilliant time-warp adventure, a powerful love story, and a gripping thriller--all in one movie.  Wild, intricate, powerful, and amazing!  Frequency is a masterpiece.  Buy it immediately!",973209600,,523,4.375
1375700,5,B00004YA66,"I first saw Frequency the day it was released in theatres, after I saw a preview that got me extremely interested in the movie. I didn't know quite what to expect, but what I found was well written movie, with excellent acting performances and a very gripping storyline, a truly enjoyable moviegoing experience. The story focuses on a cop named John Sullivan (played brilliantly by James Caviezel in a breakthrough big screen performance) who lives in Queens, NY in early October 1999, which happens to be the date of an appearance of a phenomenon that allows John to communicate with his father Frank (with a very solid and emotional performance from Dennis Quaid), on the same radio, in the same house. The interesing part is that John talks to Frank thirty years earlier, merely days before Frank, a firefighter, dies herocially trying to rescue a person trapped in a blazing fire. Frank and John end up making catastrophic changes in the timeline, which leads to the brutal murder of John's mother(in an excellent performance from Elizabeth Mitchell) only days later in 1969. The movie is really a combination of several different elements. First of all it focuses on a father-son relationship between Frank and John. The interaction between Caviezel and Quaid is superb, and leads to some of the films most emotionally moving moments. The emotion is skillfully achieved, as Caviezel and Quaid don't act face-to-face, but across a HAM radio. The interplay between the two time periods really adds to the movie without overshadowing the its story. Frequency also combines elements of suspense, action, mystery, and tense drama. Frequency covers all of the bases, and does so very skillfully. This brings us to the DVD disc itself, which comes from New Line Home Video, who completely loaded the disc with a huge amount of special features, including many interesting DVD-ROM features that can be accessed by any PC with a DVD-ROM drive and PC Friendly installed. If you don't have PC Friendly on your computer, the DVD will install it for you if you so choose. The disc also has deleted scenes, as well as several feature legnth commentaries(by the director, producer, and actor Noah Emmerich who plays the adult Gordo, John's best friend). The disc also includes an interesting original documentary, as well as a trailer and animation galleries. If you are are willing to let your mind go a little bit to accept the science of the storyline, it actually becomes a fascinating part of the movie. This movie would definitely be a worthy addition to any DVD collection. Frequency also offers an extremely exciting and rewarding finale that will not disappoint anyone who watches it. The bottom line is this: Frequency is a wonderful movie, with incredibly strong emotional performances from the entire cast, very moving dramatic moments, as well as tense, gripping action sequences, and a rousing finale. Frequency is definitely one to remember. This movie truly has it all!",973123200,155,2975,5.012121212121212
1375701,3,B00004YA66,"Frequency starts like a story you'd expect to hear from your grandfather, reagiling at the past, builing it up as a better time.  But director Gregory Hoblit has no intention of letting this movie sit on it's laurels or to rely so heavily on this sentimental tripe we've been forced to endure too many times.  Like Pleasantville it gentally tugs at our idealic recolections of the past before blantantly tearing them down before our eyes.  That's when things really pick up and we realize that this isn't the movie New Line'd built it up as being.  It's an edge of your seat thrill ride with intesity to spare and not the weepy overdone meaning-of-life story we've seen done to death since Titanic.  Realitively unknown actor Jim Caviezel plays a New York cop still scared by the the loss of his firefighter dad (Dennis Quaid) thirty years ago.  We bounce back and forth between time as both 1969 and 1999 are unfolding parrellel to eachother.  One night while playing with his father's old ham radio Caviezel finds himself talking to his dad days before his death.  After the typical skeptism you'd expect from any protagonist in a sci-fi yarn, he realizes that he's been given a second chance, one in which he can use to save his father's life.  But there are unexpected consequeces to his fiddling with time, the most notable of which is the continuance of a serial killer who now goes on to kill seven more victims, one of which is his own mother (I won't give too much away).  It's an interesting premise and overdone as it my be the serial killer gere is still facinating stuff.  Reviews have hailed it as Back to the Future meets Seven and though both films are far superior Frequency does a remarkably seamless job of interweaving elements of the two.  The DVD offers a few extended scenese (nothing too exciting) and commentary tracks which to my amazement include neither the director of it's notable stars.  Still, the movies is good enough itself to justify it's purchase.",973123200,,1984,4.699421965317919
1375702,5,B00004YA66,"Without a doubt, this movie will appeal to both men and women (when's the last time you agreed on what movie to watch???  lol).
Anytime Dennis Quaid is in a movie, I'm guaranteed to watch it and this one didn't disappoint.  I found that everytime I *thought* I had it figured out....I was wrong.  It kept me guessing throughout.  Which is good because it wasn't predictable.  The constant ""shift"" of events in the past kept changing the future that the movie because suspenseful and interesting.
I remember reading a review of this movie before I went to see it.  The reviewer said that just about every man that sees it will come out of the theatre remincising about their childhood and especially their father.  Sure enough, my husband talked about his dad almost all the way home from the theatre.

1375704,5,B00004YA66,"Don't discount Frequency for it's far-fetched plot.  (A son makes contact with his deceased father 30 in the past using an old ham radio.)  It works for this movie.  After the son of a firefighter learns he can communicate with his father through an old radio, he warns his father of his impending death, and thus changes history.  While this bodes well for them, others soon become victims of a serial killer, who had disappeared before their interference with time.  Father and son work together to solve the mystery of the serial killings, racing against the clock to save a loved one who is now to be the next victim.
This movie is a fantasy.  It's about family, and how being ripped apart from the ones you love can affect your life.  It's a heartwarming story, filled with suspense, action, humor, and drama.  There's a wonderful score, and an finale that has to be seen to be believed.  This movie is highly recommended.",972864000,9,927,4.638036809815951

I don't want to give to much away but it gets into the whole theory of time travel and the paradoxs that could occur if someone meddles in the past, one tiny little eventcould be catastrophic to the future and so forth.

In this day and age of advanced technology it seems that every time you turn around they come out with a new movie about the dangers of  technology. The latest one is a very good movie that grabs at your  heartstrings and also keeps you on the edge of your seat. Police officer  John Sullivan is having a bad night. His wife has left him and he knows  that she's not coming back.  When his best friend since childhood discovers  the old ham radio that John's father Frank owned in the closet of John's  house they dig it out and what happens next is nothing short of astounding.  John  finds himself talking to his father through the radio. The trouble is  that Frank died in a fire 30 years ago in 1969. When they realize what is  going on John tries to convince Frank that he's going to die in a fire that  he as a firefighter will be called to help fight. After saving his life,  John realizes that. he has changed the course of history and that now in  order to prevent another death he will have to use information from the  90's combined with help from his father in the 60's to catch a killer known  as the ""Nightingale Rapist"" who will have claimed the life of  their mother unless they can stop him before the night she would have died  in 1969 falls. Directed by Gregory Hoblit (""Primal Fear"") this  chilling thriller is full of things that are improbable, but with the solid  acting that populates this movie it's a minor flaw in an otherwise great  film which is a sure bet to be on my top 10 films of the year.
