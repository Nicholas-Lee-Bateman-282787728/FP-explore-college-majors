8095960,1,B000C6NP6I,"Maureen shows up about 35 minutes into the movie. I was reading Maureen's autobiography about her coke habit and doing this movie, among others.  I have always been a Mauren fan.. how she managed to act and be drugged up is beyond me.  That said, the movie is awful.... non stop music which is incredibly irritating.  The bullies, the senseless hunting (they actually admit to shooting and leaving the animals to die), racism, stupid western style clothes, ignorant denture-less dick with an ugly grin, littering, clothing and scene changes with no sedway...Maureen smokes cigs but no smoke comes out of her mouth.  The only character I liked (besides Maureen) was the dog.  The dog, without a collar, rides in the back of a truck down a highway.  The ASPCA must have been asleep during that portion of film making.  I don't get why the dog didn't get upset when his master was being attacked.  My toy poodle gaps at a leaf blowing around.  Some parts of the film are too dark to see what's going on and that's probably a blessing.  Typical Amazon Prime movie.",1523664000,,1060,4.681081081081081

8095962,1,B000C6NP6I,"inferior photography, abusive and trashing behaviors, mindless trashing of the desert with empty shotgun shells and dead animals left to rot, silly hustle by pretty working girl Fay with young boy Buddy about to get lucky but disrupted by his Daddy's drunk thuggy friends who inflict nonconsensual sex on the girl, pointless violence against each other by Daddy's thuggy friends.  This trash flick has all the features for a ONE STAR RATING.",1504396800,,441,5.125

8095966,1,B000C6NP6I,"Outdated and dull, pointless insipid Texas redneck junk... It's a good thing this came and went quickly..Let's all hope it stays buried for good once it slithers out of print.. It's not a comedy, unless you like dumb racist homophobic rapist bullies who just want to kill animals and fight... It's certainly not a suspense either, even though it sort of wants to be one in the final 20 mins..... and Marcia Brady (Maureen McCormack) gets raped too... Seriously, there's no redeeming value at all.",1396310400,2,496,4.847058823529411
8095967,5,B000C6NP6I,"For all the fans of the Brady Bunch, or anyone who enjoys a good movie, this is for you.  described on the jacket as a comedy, i feel this story is more in the light of a comming of age drama. the stereotyped rednecks get their just deserts in the best way as our hero gets the girl and the experience all together.  A HUGE bonus is Maureen McCormick's singing with the guitar, a DO NOT MISS for any Country Music fans or anyone else who likes a good singer whatever the genre.  Definately a must buy.",1225584000,5,501,4.144329896907217
8095968,1,B000C6NP6I,"When I heard that one of my favorite B movies from the 80's was coming out on DVD I was happy!! I ordered this DVD from MEDIA BLASTERS / GUILTY PLEASURES (known as RAREFLIX on EBAY) for a reasonable price. After quick delivery I anxiously put the disc in to watch!

  Well.... first the good news. The old saying ""Better to have something than nothing"" is true. The Bad News? To start the source print is less than spectacular. The film is dirty, grainy at times. Multiple splices throughout disc. Full Screen transfer, no widescreen. Extras include 4 trailers from other films. There is a 'promotional' trailer of ""Texas Lightning"" on disc which is nothing more than the montage of scenes from the film's end made up as a teaser trailer.

Also to squash any rumors that might be floating about regarding the 'MAUREEN MCCORMICK NUDE SCENES', Uh.. They don't exist. At least not in this DVD version. Yes she does have a fling in a motel with one of the central characters but nothing more. I do recommend the VHS tape from MEDIA HOME VIDEO if you can locate it. Their transfer was from a better quality 35mm print. However if you are dying to see this film and do order the DVD, don't say I didn't warn you.",1142208000,24,1206,4.468181818181818
