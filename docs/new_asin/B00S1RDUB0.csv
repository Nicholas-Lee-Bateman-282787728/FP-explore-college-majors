I enjoy their old stuff, like Puppet Master 1-3, Seedpeople, and Demonic Toys, but I'm not a fan at all of Evil Bong and The Ginger Dead Man, or any of the others they've done for the past two decades.

That said, Trophy Heads does a good job of bringing back our beloved scream queens.  The plot is fun too, with a whacky fan wanting to immortalize our scream queens by turning them into trophy mounts.  The relationship between the fanboy and his mother is enjoyable as well.  Overall, it's like Full Moon creating an homage to, um, Full Moon.

It's low budget, simple, but overall, a good time.  If you're excited by the cover alone, then the movie won't disappoint.  Horror comedy more than a bloodfest.",1422576000,22,830,4.466666666666667

8696867,3,B00S1RDUB0,"I enjoyed the movie, but I was a bit disappointed. Let me start by saying I have collected these scream queen films since the 80's, so I am a fan. I thought there could have been more of a plot.  Just chopping scream queens heads for a collection off was not enough for me.  Granted it had it's moments of humor. I wish there could have been more. Still I recommend it to any fans of these actresses. I enjoyed watching it.",1465516800,,423,4.146341463414634

8696869,4,B00S1RDUB0,"This is a film most horror fans will either love or hate. Max (Adam Noble Roberts) has the idea life living in his mom's basement (Maria Olsen ) watching old cult horror films from the 70's and 80's. Max laments that they aren't making films like this anymore and that the scream queens have gotten old. Never mind the fact many of these films were made before he was born. Max and mom devise a scheme to recreate scenes from old cult classic films, sort of, and kill and mount the heads of the scream queens.

I loved the fact the film payed homage to nude ladies of  the cult classics with outtakes. However the dialogue of the feature was trite and boring. It wore thin. It could have been a classic if Charles Band had better writing help.

Guide: Plenty of F-bombs, sex and nudity in films plus producer/writer/actress Irena Murphy topless.",1451347200,4,845,4.509803921568627

This will go down in my Top 10 2015 horror movies. And you need to listen to me I'm like the Pope of movie critics. Trust me I don't like to spoil any part of movies you haven't seen so the less you know the better. Just know you will love this film, I guarentee it. My only complaint was I wish there was more gore. Otherwise everything else was perfect.",1442793600,,514,4.099009900990099

8696873,4,B00S1RDUB0,"Full Moon Features has been entertaining me for decades with exactly the same type of film that our protagonist, Max, is obsessed with in this fun and creepy flick. What a great surprise to see that so much thought and care went into creating this movie. The eerie setting coupled with the dysfunctional mother and son relationship, as well as the inside jokes and dark humor strike the perfect tone. I couldn't have imagined anything better.

The story revolves around Max, who lives in his mothers basement and is despondent that the glory days of vhs b-movies is fading, along with its beautiful starlets and scream queens. Max, aided by his snaggle-toothed mother, who would do anything for her baby boy, sets out to create an ongoing performance piece that involves kidnapping the likes of Brinke Stevens, Linnea Quigley, and Michelle Bauer. As the title suggests, heads do roll.

What I was pleased to see is that the countless cameos by the likes of Stuart Gordon, David DeCoteau, and other notables, not only serve as a humorous point of reference for fans of these genre films, but are genuinely entertaining and fun. I have nothing but good things to say about lead actors Adam Noble Roberts and Maria Olsen as well, who are both believable and menacing. Trophy Heads, produced and directed by Charles Band, really has it all.",1428624000,10,1336,4.829694323144105
