3176380,4,B001808CQA,"I watched this movie today.  It is a good movie, not fantastic but nice enough.  I agree with another reviewer who said the first part of the movie and the rest are very different, almost like another movie.  The beginning of the movie is a sweet depiction of the relationship between the two twenty something year old women.  In the middle it is less frothy and has more conflict and angst.  I won't mention the ending; I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone.

If you are looking for steamy and graphic sex scenes you won't find that here.  This movie reminds me of our lesbian movies of 10 or 20 years ago.  It is more simple and innocent than the usual fare today.  Knowing nothing of lesbians in Japan I don't know whether this movie is groundbreaking or usual.  I wish there was an interview with the writers and directors of Love My Life and perhaps a documentary on lesbian life in Japan.  It would be helpful to watch this movie in the context of GLBT life in Japan.

The extras on the DVD are few.  They include deleted scenes, without subtitles and a Japanese trailer.",1219968000,10,1083,4.409090909090909
3176381,2,B001808CQA,"I'm not reviewing the content of the film here, just the DVD authoring.  The subtitles are hard-coded onto the video stream, not on a switchable subtitle track.  The US licensor/manufacturer just got the English-subtitled ""film festival"" print of this film and ripped it straight to disk.  Part of the point of DVD technology was multiple switchable language tracks and subtitle streams.  The manufacturer was just lazy and took the fast-track in this case.  I guess getting the original print and the subtitle script and doing it properly was too much work for them.  Why bother releasing it if it's going to be a half-baked attempt?

Another perpetrator of this kind of laziness is Viz Media with their ""Kamikaze Girls"" US release.",1218153600,2,733,5.008264462809917

8267996,5,B001808CQA,"This award winning lesbian drama constitutes a touching and moving love story revolving around the love affair between two college students - Eri, whose father and mother are divorced, given the fact that they decided to marry out of societal pressure during the time of Victorian morals, where homosexuals were the subject of extreme discrimination as homosexuality went against the norms of society, and, resultant of that, caved in to pressure to engage in a heterosexual relationship and tie the knot in marriage and father a child, in a society where marriage  and having a family were terminal values, whom they, nevertheless, treasured and loved beyond all measure, from whom they kept their homosexual tendencies a secret for fear of estranging themselves from their daughter only to discover that she was having an affair with Ichiko, and, having so discovered, Eri's father - with whom she was staying, given the fact that he had won custody over her following the divorce, who, himself, was having an affair with another man (the affair of which he kept a secret until he discovers the fact that Eri was a lesbian, and, having done so, blurts out his and his ex-wife's deep harbored secret, and encourage her relationship with Ichiko, and arrange for her to meet his lover, under the latter's encouragement), resultant of which, Eri and Ichiko ardently pursue their relationship and, while at a beach, encounter Eri's father's college professor - who herself was a lesbian and having an affair with another women (also a college professor), and, being gay, also encourage Eri in her relationship with Ichiko (whose father, and mother have successful careers as lawyers and harbor unrealistic expectations of their daughter by expecting her to walk in their footsteps and establish a career for herself as a lawyer, and. given the strained relationship between Ichikos father and her, spurs her to spite her father by pursuing the career of his choice but to engage in a different field of practice, and having performed badly in her last exam, pressurizes her to take her studies more seriously, and, caving to unrealistic parental expectations, inducing Ichiko to voice and carry through her intentions to stop seeing Eri while concentrating on her studies, resultant of which, Eri finds herself heartbroken and decides to forgo her relationship with Ichiko, only to discover Ichiko realizing that she should not cave in to parental expectations nor to societal pressure and treasure the genuine person who she is and be herself and to love her life, and, in so doing, decide to become a writer and to commit her life story in a novel which not only  makes its way to the bestseller list but also wins several awards, thereby, legitimizing her choice of career and her decision to be herself.",1418342400,,2804,5.015021459227468

8267998,5,B001808CQA,I love this Japanese Lesbian love story.  It has a lot of twists so watch carefully.,1415577600,,84,4.25
8267999,3,B001808CQA,"A Japanese film about a lesbian couple. That's different ! Unfortunately, even though I found the relationship between Ichiko and her father rewarding, the one between her and Eri felt superficial. Rei Yoshii's enactment of her character verged on ""Hello Kitty"" with way too much wide-eyes and innocence for a lesbian already out of her closet. The role of Eri, on the other hand, was intriguing and although Asami Imajuku infused it with a sense of naturalism and confidence, the focus on her was relegated to the background too much. The portrayal of two lesbians in an intimate relationship was rather antiseptic (the opening sequence with the back-and-forth candy was neither erotic nor sensual, but more like two immature girls experimenting with something weird and forbidden). There was also an odd sense of holding-back by Yoshii whenever the plot called for a display of same-sex desire; and when she and Imajuku finally get to express mutual physical pleasure, the tenor lacked passion.",1319068800,,996,5.154320987654321
8268000,5,B001808CQA,"I must say, this movie depicted one of society's flaws in an enjoyable way. In my opinion, this was a top movie in its category. I enjoyed more than ""Spider Lilies"" and ""Saving Face."" I highly recommend this movie.",1310428800,2,214,4.512820512820513
8268001,5,B001808CQA,"This is a very interesting movie. It is not what I expected, but there were few interesting scenes that I've enjoyed. Overall, I like this movie. Thank you.",1244678400,2,156,4.607142857142857
8268002,4,B001808CQA,"Well this is no Hollywood movie by any means but its a cute movie all the same. I can relate to this movie in some ways which is why I loved it. I am more like Eri, (Yes, I'm female) the serious one. My girlfriend is the happy, bouncy one like Ichiko. Ok, maybe not that bouncy but pretty close. Lol  Our personalities are very different, but we still click and we love each other. Over all I think the movie was real. At least to me. Some say its a little flat but it does tug at the heart strings a bit. So I say take it for what it is, a cute movie about two girls in love.",1233360000,2,576,3.8
8268003,3,B001808CQA,"Cute, bouncy movie about two young lesbians in Japan who decide to come out to their families.  One girl has a pretty easy time of it, and in fact gets one upped by her dad when he happily returns the favor of her honesty with some revelations of his own.  The other girl has a grumpy dad and more of a problem with the whole thing.  But things never get too depressing, and in fact it's easy to believe from the overall fun, upbeat tone that ""Love My Life"" was adapted from a Japanese manga series, the Japanese version of comic books.  Pretty innocent overall, this movie would probably get a PG-13 here in the states if not for our manic paranoia about gay subject matter and even fleeting nudity.  Extras consist of a few deleted scenes (without English subtitles, unlike the film itself) and a nice selection of trailers highlighting other interesting-looking fringe movies.  ""Love My Life"" isn't very memorable, but one can do a lot worse.",1228694400,,945,4.595238095238095
8268004,4,B001808CQA,"Love My Life is an adorable story about two college students who fall in love.  Ichiko, the younger, is an emotional girl who loves books and people; Eri is an aspiring lawyer with a more serious temperament. The first half of the movie explores their families and friends, while the second half is about a rift that develops between the two and how they find each other again.

Love My Life is not a perfect movie.  There are a few over the top moments that are difficult to believe, and some acting is a little weak.  But the movie is redeemed by its incredible energy.  It reminds you of how good it can be to be alive, hence the title, and how enjoyable things can be.  This movie, while not life-changing, is fun and watching it makes you want to have fun, something everyone needs to be prodded into doing now and then.",1225065600,,825,4.359477124183006
