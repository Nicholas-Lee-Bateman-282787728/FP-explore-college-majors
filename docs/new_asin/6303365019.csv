636386,2,6303365019,This is made by the same duo (Sellier and Balsiger) wrote the junky misinformative In Search of Noah's Ark book and film in the 70's. This film itself briefly presents skeptics of an idiotic totally worldwide flood briefly then sneakily dwells on highly paid quack scientists who present bogus evidence of a world wide flood. This probably leaves the untrained viewer with the wrong impression of strong evidence of a worldwide flood. See books at your library by Prof. Lloyd Bailey on just how misinformative this duo can be.,1133913600,2,526,4.921348314606742
636387,5,6303365019,"This video answers some of the important question evolutionist pose.  Such as, where did the water come from and where did it go.  Experts from a number of different fields give their opinions, from both sides of the  issue.  Presented in a documentary format, and produced by secular  researchers, this video is a must see.",951609600,13,324,4.818181818181818
636530,4,6303365019,"Forget about all the hoax talk.  Follow up on their ""Jammal"" hoax and you'll quickly find a lot about nothing.  In any case, that guy's testimony is not even in this version of the program, the producers obviously figuring out that it would not be wise to include his false account.  I'm not entirely convinced his account even exists.  I'm quickly learning there is a significant effort to taint the evidence out there concerning Noah's Ark.  And there's plenty of people ready to spout their uninformed viewpoint to try and destroy the credibility of programs like this. For all the controversy, definetely see the movie for yourself and you'll see it's pretty provocative, even for a low budget, after-school kind of movie.  My mind is made up and I'm not vested in the religious implications.  The different eye witness accounts from varied nationalities around the world coupled with photography and historian accounts leaves little doubt about the Ark's existence high up that mountain but just enough doubt to still allow you to exercise the power of your faith.",1204070400,6,1069,4.97191011235955
636531,5,6303365019,"This DVD is worth getting for anyone who is interested in the history and evidences that have been found regarding Noah's Ark.  The DVD is a search and exploration of the evidences that the large barge located on the Mountains of Ararat is probably the Ark of the Biblical Noah.  It is a wonderful DVD and very well done.  It reviews the history, interviews people who have climbed up and seen the boat, and explores questions generated by the findings and skeptics.  I would recommend the DVD to anyone who is interested in the topic of the biblical flood or biblical Studies.",1196726400,2,577,4.627450980392157

Also examined are possibilities of the ark's being hidden in a volcanic peak bordering Iran and the former Sovient Emire at Mt. Ararat.",1191024000,,385,5.126984126984127
636533,5,6303365019,"""The Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark"" was first shown on CBS in 1992.  I was able to record it off the air then, but am glad it finally became available on DVD.  While I have seen the same film with other narrarators, this one with Darren McGavin I like the best.  While he was an accomplished actor, he really does seem to genuinely enjoy hosting this documentary.
  The book by the same title is also very informative, and I would encourage those who like this DVD presentation to read the book as well.  There are aspects of the book that are even better than the movie, but I wouldn't want to have one without the other.",1186876800,22,627,4.362068965517241
636534,5,6303365019,"I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS DOCUMENTARY TO ANYONE. IT IS COMPLEMENTARY TO THE FACT THAT THE HOLY BIBLE IS THE WORD OF GOD AND THAT GOD JUDGED THE WORLD BECAUSE OF SIN AND WAS GRACIOUS TO NOAH AND HIS FAMILY BECAUSE NOAH BELIEVED GOD AND ""MOVED WITH FEAR AND, PREPARED AN ARK TO THE SAVING OF HIS HOUSE"" HEBREWS 11:7. GOD IS STILL IN THE JUDGING BUSINESS AND SAVING BUSINESS. SIN CONDENMS AND KILLS US, BUT WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT GOD LOVES US SO MUCH THAT HE CAME INTO THIS WORLD IN THE PERSON OF HIS SON AND NEVER SINNED, SO THAT HE COULD DIE FOR OUR SINS AND SHED HIS BLOOD TO COVER OUR SINS, IF WE CALL OUT TO JESUS CHRIST TO COME INTO OUR HEARTS (SPIRIT AND SOUL) GOD GIVES US HIMSELF IN THE PERSON OF THE HOLY SPIRIT! THIS IS CALLED AMAZING GRACE. ""BELIEVE ON THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, AND THOU (you) SHALT BE SAVED AND THY(your) HOUSE (family)"" ACTS 16:31",1174348800,3,850,4.189024390243903

636536,5,6303365019,"This documentation of the discovery of Noah's Ark is absolutely diffinitive. It is the most remarkable coverage and video footage to show what has been found atop Mount Ararat. I would recommend this video to anyone who questions the truth of the Bible or existence of Noah, the Ark, and the Flood. Very spine tingling.",1168128000,8,319,4.818181818181818
636537,3,6303365019,"This DVD may present a more skeptical view of Noah's Ark, but it still creates a fantasy world of possibility where mystery is more important than fact and satellite imagery only shows what we think might exist. People love mystery and hope is always present. I think this DVD is actually more interesting from that perspective and there are some ideas for how a worldwide flood could have occurred. Fossils are shown and if you enjoy reading biblical accounts, a story is played out to give you a sense of how long it would have actually taken to build such a large vessel. Tests are employed to see if such a vessel would sink under extreme conditions and the problems of how the animals could have been cared for is also addressed.  Many different people, from archeologists to those who claim first-hand knowledge and sightings are interviewed. This is a good introduction to the mystery of the Ark if you are fascinated by this topic.

636538,1,6303365019,"In 1993 CBS aired a highly sensationalized special entitled ""The Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark,"", which contained a long section devoted to the claims of George Jammal, who showed what he called ""sacred wood from the ark"". Jammal's story of a dramatic mountain expedition which allegedly took the life of ""his Polish friend Vladimir"" was actually a deliberate hoax. Jammal, who was really a professional actor, later revealed that his ""sacred wood"" was wood taken from railroad tracks in Long Beach, California, and hardened by cooking with various sauces and baked it in an oven to make it hard and appear to be old. Jammal really wanted to expose the company producing the programe (Sun International) but then they threatened to sue and send the FBI after him. After the program aired, he eventully spoke out, and you can find his full confession on the Internet.

This program was manufactured to be a hoax from the beginning (the production company knew the real truth), and over 40 million veiwers watched the documentary. In Skeptic magazine (Spring 1994), Jim Lippard wrote an investigative report, revealing several dozen lies and misleading propaganda tricks which David Balsiger (Executive Producer at Sun International, and he wrote a couple books on the subject) had written into the Noah's Ark program. You probably remember a show were a guy said that said he had ""wood from the Ark"" but you never really remember hearing a definitive answer. So yes, the special was a lie, and now you know. And knowing is half the battle.",1154563200,11,1543,4.98062015503876
636539,1,6303365019,Mt. Ararat (Masis Mons in Latin) wasn't even supposed to be the mountain Noah's Ark landed on till the Middle Ages when Masis developed a tradition about the ark's landing. This video which is all about Mt. Ararat having the ark is idiotic as the writers don't seem to care much about the fact I just wrote. I've read their junky books--they realize it but they went on advocating Mt. Ararat all the same.,1153785600,,405,4.486486486486487

7845137,1,6303365019,"I guess this is the best place to mention this, as the Documentary does not at all disclose what was done with the animal dung/waste, now bear in mind that it is calculated at roughly 80% of the boat's mass and it would have taken 4 men two years just to shovel off if you do the math.

Also, I'd like to know where they would have actually found wood in Palestine at the time, as it was a desert without any trees or nails. It was mentioned the size was about 2 football fields, anyone with experience in nautical engineering knows a boat that size made out of wood would have collapsed due to its instability. Not only that but the animals would have carried fleas and most likely have been infected with rabies, and other transmittable diseases that would have wiped everyone out in a matter of months because of thousands of gallons of fetid urine, not to mention there are 8 trillion varieties of insects that would have had to have been collected and stored in some type of glass bottle, if produced, would have taken 218 years just to make, glass making was not found in Palestine due to the bad silica.

And no one has mentioned yet that there are no sails or oars to row. I could go on and on. Yeah, someone without brains obviously wrote this stuff. And obviously people are gullible enough to believe it also.",1387756800,,1320,4.383673469387755

As an avid Bible student, I was impressed with the research and incredible accounts of the facts regarding the flood of Noah's day. It all fits right in with what the scriptures say, justifying the biblical account. People say the flood  and Noah are simply stories in the Bible. Well, if the people in Noah's day were brought back to life, I'm sure they'd say ""Pay attention to the facts- there's another biggie coming in the future and you don't want to end up like us""(Armaggeddon).
