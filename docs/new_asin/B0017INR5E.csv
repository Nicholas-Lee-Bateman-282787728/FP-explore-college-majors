8266166,5,B0017INR5E,"Bought for my Mother who is in a nursing home and they won't let them change channels on the TV's, so we bought her a portable CD player and tons of movies from Amazon.com and she has so many movies to watch and I have 3 times that many waiting for the next holiday! She is so thrilled, we couldn't have picked a better gift and she loves all the old movies and movie stars! Everyone should do this if they have someone in a nursing home!",1431043200,2,438,4.045977011494253

8266168,1,B0017INR5E,"Whoever Jewell is, the company that produced this DVD really sucks!  The quality is rotten.  Sound track is not lined up with the actor when they talk
You know like the old Jap movies where the mouth is moving way faster than the English dub in.  The picture is always briefly stopping for a second or so through the whole movie.  We managed to get through one movie. It was tough.  Threw the rest of the DVD's in the trash.  My recommendation
DONT EVER BUY ANYTHING WITH THE NAME JEWELL ATTATCHED.  Movie pack is a great idea, just a piss poor execution. YUK!",1423958400,8,560,4.378640776699029
8266169,2,B0017INR5E,Have only watched 2 of the disks.....very disappointing.  movies kept haulting and stopping and when they did play the sound and action was out of sync.  I was so frustrated I gave up watching.  Would like to return but have not tried yet.,1420588800,11,239,4.511627906976744
