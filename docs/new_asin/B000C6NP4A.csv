2453578,5,B000C6NP4A,"I became a Robson Green fan when I saw the first season of Wire in the Blood.  Since then, I have read the books, and watched Green in his other crime series, Touching Evil.  If you like to watch films about police solving serial killer crimes, you will enjoy this.  The crimes are shocking, the denouement is interesting, and at the heart of the story is the developing relationship between Dr. Tony Hill (Green) and the police woman with whom he works these crimes.",1142208000,25,467,4.535714285714286

2453625,5,B000C6NP4A,"I discovered this series quite by accident. Having loved&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Place-of-Execution/dp/B002SAJ6EQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Place of Execution</a>, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written, and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.

I have become a fan of this TV series which follows the investigations led by DI later DCI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.

Unlike some of the ""cozy"" mysteries such as the long-running Midsomer Murders and The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.

The third season contains four episodes:
Redemption - young boys are found murdered, and investigations reveal these boys came from abusive homes. Tony's research and investigations discover a serial killer who thinks the killings are an act of mercy.
Bad Seed - a dangerous killer nicknamed Mack the Knife is pronounced rehabilitated and set free, but Tony is not convinced the man has changed his ways. Then a spate of gruesome murders occur and Tony and DCI Jordan must do all they can to find the killer before more lives are lost.
Nothing But the Night - one of the most twisted plots so far in the series. A series of murders leave both DCI Jordan and Tony Hill baffled. There does not seem to be a connection between the victims, but then Tony discovers there may be a link after all, and more than one perpetrator may be involved.
Synchronicity - there's a sniper on the loose and DCI Jordan's investigations are made even more complicated when Tony discovers he has a brain tumor, one which appears to be growing.

The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DCI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show.

I downloaded the entire Series Three, and the quality of the streaming was very good overall, as was picture quality.",1318464000,,3123,5.079922027290448
2453626,4,B000C6NP4A,"Haven't watched this DVD yet, but I have seen a few of the installments on British TV, so I am looking forward to watching.",1293235200,,123,4.166666666666667
2453627,5,B000C6NP4A,"A quirky irresistable series essential to true mystery lovers
and psychological thrillers. Brilliantly produced and acted, every episode is
a teriffic night at the movies. Don't miss it.",1222905600,,186,5.678571428571429
2453628,4,B000C6NP4A,"I just finished watching Season 3, and am officially addicted.  While I am waiting for my Season 4 disc to arrive, I will try to control my jones by writing this review.

Both Hermione Norris and Robson Green were unknown to this American prior to watching this series, but they are both fabulous in their respective roles as DCI Carol Jordan and profiler extraordinaire Dr. Tony Hill.  Dr. Hill can best be described as 'quirky', sometimes unsettlingly so, in his methods, and his ability to intuit the minds of twisted serial killers leaves him several bubbles off plumb in normal human interactions.  However, DCI Jordan is similarly laser-focused on her career, and over the episodes she and Dr. Hill have forged a real and tender bond that makes each the other's best and most reliable friend.  Though Carol and Tony often come tantalizingly close to becoming far more than friends and professional colleagues (and for these two rather damaged, very lonely people, we want them to stop dancing and just get it on already!), so far the series, prudently perhaps, keeps any romantic feelings bubbling under the surface but as yet unacted upon.

There are unmistakable echoes of 'Prime Suspect's Jane Tennyson in Carol Jordan that go beyond blonde hair; Helen Mirren brought us a cautionary portrait of a workaholic police inspector whose career and natural inclination shut meaningful personal relationships out of her life until it's too late.  DCI Jordan is in danger of treading down that same path if she's not careful.  Perhaps (and I hope so) this series will finally wrap up with Tony and Carol as a couple, and save Carol from Jane Tennyson's fate.  In the meantime the dance is fun to watch.

""Fun"" might perhaps be the wrong word for a series that is unabashedly grisly.  Really.  ""Wire in the Blood"" (and I sincerely hope I never find out what that means) is hands down the most graphic show I have seen.  Indeed there are scenes here that would have not been out of place in David Fincher's ""Se7en"".  American crime shows are fairly sanitized for this kind of thing, and we Yanks are a bit unprepared for the sheer amount of gore and even nudity of corpses which this show presents us.  Be advised that the crime scenes in this series require a strong stomach, and make anything on ""Law & Order"" look like a children's cartoon.  This show doesn't just push the envelope; it tears it completely.  I find a grudging admiration in the risks this show takes--and here I thought that British TV was supposed to be so boring!

Robson Green is my new crush, and writer Val McDermid, who created the character says that Mr. Green is the 'definitive' Tony Hill as he existed in her imagination.  I know he certainly fires up my imagination, and has grown on me as this series has progressed.  If you're a fan of crime dramas, gird your stomach and watch this--you won't be sorry.",1221004800,6,2885,4.720558882235529
2453629,4,B000C6NP4A,"Once again, BBCA, brings us another great season of twisted, compelling, sickning entertainment in Wire in the Blood.  The writers don't disappoint.  Just when you think, they couldn't possibly bring anymore derange behavior to the table, you are left jaw dropped with each every story.  As expected, the entire cast delivers superbly.",1218412800,,335,5.403846153846154
2453630,5,B000C6NP4A,This is an outstanding series with Dr Hill being so unique. Its hard to tell sometimes whether he should be a patient or the pyschologist. His relationship with Carol is warm and thier friendship is beneficial to both of them. Its nice to see a woman actor play a script where it is written for a women. In American series the woman's role is written for a man and just play by a woman. It really makes it cartoonish. Wire In the Blood's characters are complete people with faults and emotions. I love this series and hopefully everyone will get a chance to see it.,1215993600,,565,4.390476190476191
2453631,5,B000C6NP4A,"This series is great, similar formats do appear with Bones and the like. They are successful coz they are well written, well acted and put togther extremely well. more please.",1212969600,,175,4.866666666666666
2453632,5,B000C6NP4A,"Green's character of Tony Hill, written by Val McDermid, is a wonderful blend of intelligence, compassion, single-mindedness and utter obtuseness when it comes to interacting with people who are NOT serial killers.  These videos bring him to life in as clear a manner as John Thaw's ""Inspector Morse,"" but in a much more graphic style.

The stories are all well-written (with a complexity reminiscent of the Prime Suspect series) and the cinematography is griping and memorable. The scene in the first series of wind turbines viewed from a passing train is one which I will always carry with me.

I've enjoyed Green in previous series, but nothing has come close to The Wire in the Blood, for pure quality writing, acting and impact.",1179187200,5,733,4.943089430894309
