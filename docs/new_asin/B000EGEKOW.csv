2517724,5,B000EGEKOW,"This workout to me is a party in a box, to seasoned Christi fans that might sound totally lame but I have a ball with this workout.  Christi Taylor is known for her dancy, spinny and twirly choreography which is not for clutzes like me.  She has quite a variety of step and hi-lo aerobics videos for those who crave complex moves, but this is her first video directed to those new to her work or beginner/intermediate steppers in general.  There is a 20 minute step segment and 20 minute hi-lo segment.  Both are a lot of fun, and somedays when I am only up to 20 minutes of cardio, I will pop this in my player and end up doing all of it because it's so much fun.

You begin with a warmup consisting of grapevines, step taps, heel digs and plenty of squats & calf lifts to warm up your legs. Then it's on to the step section, Christi teaches 4 combinations, one at a time and will run through them several times.  This may not appeal to all as some may think it's repetitive, and maybe it is but it doesn't bother me.  The moves in this segment are simple but not too basic, keeping things interesting.  You will see basic steps, arabesques, rocking horses, lunges, scoops on and off the step, knee lifts, up-tap side, mambos or pivots, L-steps, V-steps, corner knees, repeaters, turn steps and turn shuffles. There are also simple assorted arm movements that go with each step.

If you feel like more the hi-lo segment is next which is as just as fun.  Again there are four combinations which Christi will teach one at a time, then run through them all several times.  The moves that are seen here are step touches, single & double hamstring curls, hip shakes, grapevines, scoops, mambos, side taps, walk up knee ups, pony snaps, double knees, more mambos, step taps, tap down/back, shuffle ball change, and heel taps again all with assorted arm movements for each.

After all that fun, it's time for the cooldown.  Pretty simple, just some step touches, marches and grapevines along with some stretches.

I am really glad that Christi made this video, it is one of my favorite aerobic videos, Christi is a great instructor, she cues very well and is a great choreographer.  Unfortunately most of her other videos are too complex for me but I have this one to enjoy and I do.  Christi also selects great music, the music in this video is among the best that I have heard in any of my workout videos.  She also includes a feature called MoveMaster, which goes over all the steps, some may find this handy.

Overall, I give this one 5 stars.  Highly recommended for beginner/intermediates looking for a fun step/hi-lo workout.",1157846400,91,2626,4.52542372881356
2517735,5,B000EGEKOW,"I started doing step about 15 years ago, and liked it because it was relatively low impact. Now that I am trying to lose weight I need low impact, jumping is just out of the question at the moment. I read some reviews on other Christi Taylor dvds and saw that people complained about the complicated moves. This dvd took me about 6 or 7 times to complete without having to stop and re-start when I lost my place, but it was fun the whole time. It's fun that it's challenging enough to keep my mind occupied, but that I was able to do the whole thing. I appreciate that I am concentrating so much on the moves, that the dvd is over before I realize it. Now that I have had it about a month or so I can do it well, and still enjoy it. I am looking for other Christi Taylor dvds to do in the future.
  This dvd starts with a warm up section on the floor of 10 min. Then there is a 20 min. section on the step. It is followed by a 20 min. hi-low section on the floor again with dance like moves and it finishes with a cool down of 5 min or so. I did use the move master section once and once again when a friend did the workout with me, and it was very helpful.
  Now, I mentioned that jumping is out for me, but the workout does have some small hopping here and there. I just skip that, which works out. In other work outs that I have, when I skip the hopping I can see that I am missing out on the workout, but in this one I think there is hardly a difference, and I still get a very good workout.",1345161600,2,1495,3.8758169934640523
2517736,3,B000EGEKOW,"I have found this very confusing.....I wish they would repeat the steps more, but it changes too quickly for me to follow.  I am used to doing step, but all the moves are new to me (hey, I own a Cher tape!).",1331510400,,207,3.9285714285714284
2517737,5,B000EGEKOW,This video looks more intimidating than it is. I am very uncoordinated and with a little effort I've almost got it mastered and it is incredibly fun. I did this routine as a supplement to my regular workouts so that I could take the time to learn all the moves. Once you do you get a very complete workout and you'll have alot of fun doing it. I really look forward to it. I plan on checking out more of her videos,1301011200,3,414,4.060975609756097
2517738,5,B000EGEKOW,"I enjoy this workout because it does a great job at walking you through a thorough warm-up and cool-down, and I really like that part of the workout is with the step and part is without... It's a nice mix. After 2 or 3 times, I had the moves down. Of course once you have the moves down, you can begin refining technique which allows you to reap all the benefits from this great workout-",1287532800,3,387,4.173333333333333
2517739,2,B000EGEKOW,"This workout is supposed to be for beginners, but how is a beginner supposed to follow instructions that can barely be heard over the music! There are some slightly fancy moves that change regularly but it is difficult to follow when I can barely heard the instructors cues. I understand that some people like the music but I'm doing aerobics for the exercise not for the music.

I also think that a beginners workout should have a little more explaination of the moves.

All in all, it's probably a good workout but I spent most of the time trying to figure out what was going on and trying to catch up because I couldn't hear her saying what was coming next. Plus she doesn't give much forewarning that a change is coming, but I think that after doing the workout a few times most people will be able to figure it out.",1280707200,6,820,4.3881578947368425
2517740,5,B000EGEKOW,"Being over 50 and trying to lose weight is hard. I got this video as the next step after the beginners one of Debra Mazda and find that I have managed to keep up, although I am finding the it a little harder to concentrate on the arms as well but I guess once my fitness improves I will be right. I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to start out it is fun and very easy to follow.",1280016000,,385,3.825
2517741,5,B000EGEKOW,"First, let me say that I'm 43 & can finish the workout... after having quit smoking just 5 mos ago (a 10+ year habit) & not working out AT ALL during my thirties. So, if I can do it, anyone can. Let me just say this: If you're looking for quick fix, this is not it, and don't invest in this DVD if you don't have the time to commit to learn & get good at the workouts.

That said, once I was finally convinced that someone had not actually set out to create a method of slow torture specifically designed to make my life miserable, I really got into the exercises. This DVD will make you WORK & you will feel it - but IT WON'T BE OVERWHELMING.

So, here's what I did.

I knew immediately that I wouldn't get any of the routines the first time around. So, I continued w/ my regular workout so that I was still on schedule. Then I sat through the entire Christi DVD once. After that, I actually walked the workouts - nothing strenuous, just a light walk-through to get used to the steps so that I could get used to the routine. I continued my regular workout for a couple more nights while doing the light walk-through's w/ Christi in between so that I could move between both workouts seamlessly. Again, it does take a little time to get all the moves - & trust me, it WILL take time to fully get the routines because they are both continuous 20-minute routines. But I found her cuing to be very good &, even better, she's FUN. I found myself smiling a lot throughout the routines. And it helps that she's got a little instructional section to explain some of the moves.",1268611200,7,1569,4.223333333333334
2517742,4,B000EGEKOW,This program really keeps you moving and your pulse racing. Not too difficult to follow & excellent cues from Cristy.,1266537600,2,117,4.9
2517743,4,B000EGEKOW,"The product is really good and gives good cardio workout, and it is easy to learn for anybody.. I would recommend for anybody who want good cardio exercise at home.",1255910400,2,164,4.5
2517744,5,B000EGEKOW,"Initially I was disappointed with this DVD on the first viewing: it was not only Step but also Hi-Lo.  Not having run into this before with another Step DVD I had ordered, I almost returned it saying it was not as ordered.  My workout room has carpeting and a lot of the moves for Hi-Lo require sliding or twisting that puts a lot of strain on my knees.  But after doing this a couple of time I have made my own adjustments and find it a great workout and a nice balance between the step and floor.  Plus Christi is cute in the way she ""sings"" out some of the cues.  It's novel and quite a lot of fun.  I would recomment this for any level of aerobiciser!",1251763200,5,655,4.078125
2517755,5,B000EGEKOW,"I've only gotten through part of the step workout 3 times, but since I have never done this before, I'd have to say it is good for beginners. I am picking it up pretty fast and it is giving me a good workout. I am slowly working myself up to doing the whole thing so I don't get burned out, but I think it is going to be great over all. I think it's fun which is very important in getting me up off my backside and exercising :)",1244764800,,428,3.8202247191011236
2517756,5,B000EGEKOW,Christie Taylor is so easy to follow.  Whether the DVD is complex choreography or more moderate she breaks the steps down and then layers more on top of the steps to teach the routine to you and she always tells you about 4 beats before the next step what you are doing next.  I highly recommend this DVD becasue it is one of her easier DVDs to follow.  Once you get used to her style with this one you will want more!,1242172800,,418,4.073170731707317
2517757,5,B000EGEKOW,"This was the first Christi Taylor workout that was do-able for me. I have a few of them at home since I workout daily, but I have never been able to do the entire workouts due to the complexity of the moves. I will start with hers & once I get the energy flowing, I have to stop & put in another dvd to finish since her moves are difficult to follow once I'm tired. I always love the workouts & energy, but can't seem to keep up. Mission Possible is possible! I love the songs & Shut up is the one that revives my energy level so I can finish! Thanks Christi for making this ""Mission Possible""!! :)",1231632000,,598,4.033613445378151
2517758,5,B000EGEKOW,"I got this DVD for the step workout when I outgrew beginner workouts and wanted something a bit more challenging. It was perfect for that intermediate level, gets the heart rate up, a lot of fun, great music to sing along with, but not too twirly in choreography. I did the hi/lo floor workout for the first time recently and it was a LOT of fun (but I don't know why she calls it multi impact, there were no modifications, they were all doing the same impact). But I really liked it, in any case. The floor workout was easier to learn, but that's probably because I have much more experience with floor than step, but it was faced paced and my heart rate was really up the whole time, she just kept moving and moving, it was a blast!!",1212883200,6,735,4.257142857142857
2517759,4,B000EGEKOW,"I love Christi Taylor and her work outs. I like the step portion, I had to practice the routine twice before I felt comfortable. The high/low portion is ok...Good video if you like to Step!",1212019200,2,189,4.428571428571429
2517760,3,B000EGEKOW,"The workout was ok.  This is the first Christi Taylor workout I have done so I am not used to her particular style.  I would not recommend this dvd for beginners since they do not explain the moves during the workout, it gets a bit confusing.  They do have a separate segment that explains each move, which is good but it would be helpful to have some more explanation during the workout.",1201651200,12,388,4.361111111111111
2517761,5,B000EGEKOW,"Once again - another great Christi workout.  This one was extremely easy to master.  I went through the entire workout the first time and was pretty much able to follow all of Christi's instruction.  The choreography is pretty simple, but the workout is as intense as you want it to be. For those of you who have been discouraged by her more complicated workouts - give this one a try.  I think you will be happy with it.",1201046400,7,421,4.358974358974359
2517762,5,B000EGEKOW,"I really like this DVD.
It starts with a 8 minute warm-up on the floor.  Next is a 20 minute step routine with not too difficult choreography.  It's not easy and I did sweat after 3 or 4 minutes.  After this is a Hi/Lo 20 session on the floor.  Again, the choreography is not difficult, but you will sweat.  The cuing is fantastic and the music is interesing (not crazy about the Shut-Up song, but that's at the end).  You'll end with a fun on the floor cool down.
As always, I appreciate Christi's cueing, routines, and length of aerobic session.  A+",1197331200,15,551,4.3431372549019605
2517763,5,B000EGEKOW,"Teedums wrote a great description of the whole workout, so I'm just going to say that this is so much fun(!), and that the Move Master helped me get the hang of all the steps at a slow pace so that I never felt lost once I moved on to the workout.

I have this and Jane Fonda's Complete Workout. I think Mission possible is the perfect next step up in intensity, while still keeping a few of the same steps and the great cueing. I'm so glad I bought this one.

(I watched a clip first on collagevideo.com before buying. Great way to see for yourself.)",1192579200,11,551,4.140186915887851
2517764,5,B000EGEKOW,"I just started exercising on a regular basis and this is one of first dvd's I've bought.  It's not easy to find a workout that is motivating, fun, easy but not boring, and intense with great music and excellent cues.  This is it!  I love the Move Master for teaching the basic steps before starting the workout.  It also makes a good warm up.  It did still take 2-3 attempts to get the moves down just so, but I never felt completely lost like I do with so many other routines.  I also love how relatable Christi is.  I can't wait to try out her other dvds.  I actually look forard to working out now.  Thanks Christi!!",1163462400,2,619,4.222222222222222
8109277,5,B000EGEKOW,Christi is one of the best instructors I have ever had.  I've been stepping for over 20 years and an advanced stepper. This particular dvd is for beginners with basic moves.  It is still very fun and an excellent workout. Her cueing is the best.,1392681600,,245,4.4222222222222225
8109278,5,B000EGEKOW,I am not rhythmic or 'dancey'  at all.  I did this DVD 3-4 times and now I have it mastered.  Great sweat.  Nt sure if I am ready for totally cool step 2 yet....maybe in a month or so!,1379894400,,184,3.641025641025641
8109279,4,B000EGEKOW,I have worked out to this DVD twice now.  I have 2 left feet and feel that this DVD is very easy to follow.  I get a great workout in a fairly short amount of time (28 min for warm up and step portion).,1378252800,,202,3.5681818181818183
8109280,4,B000EGEKOW,This is a great workout. It is easy to follow and fun. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a step workout that is far from boring.,1376524800,,146,3.9

8109282,5,B000EGEKOW,I really like this product. Christi is very good at what she does. She has a lot of rhythm and if your looking for soulful music its on here. Sometimes music is a big part of an exercise video. I would buy for a friend or a group exercise class. Not that 80's music. Looking for easy cueing purchase this its worth the money. Mission possible theme is just that they wear black and are saying you can do this. There is aerobics a warm up and step aerobice also a tutorial for the step exercises and a cool down.,1360800000,,511,4.12
8109283,2,B000EGEKOW,"I would not recommend this DVD to those who are new to step aerobics. I used to go to Step and Sweat classes at the gym so I am familiar with step aerobics, but I found it confusing. Her style is hard to follow. I think if you can keep up and finish it would be a great workout though. Good luck. :-)",1360108800,3,300,3.7777777777777777
8109284,4,B000EGEKOW,"I'd never done a Christi Taylor workout before, and this was the first dvd of hers I'd tried.  I consider myself an intermediate/advanced stepper. I found Christi's Mission Possible routine challenging but not so difficult as to be frustrating. I consider this a good addition to my step workout when I want to mix it up a bit. If you're a non-beginner you might give this a try. She also includes an aerobic workout and a ""move master"" tutorial.",1358985600,,446,4.6455696202531644
8109285,4,B000EGEKOW,"Good routine! She can be a touch annoying, but she is a very good instructor. The instruction portion is a wonderful addition. I wish every video had that!
