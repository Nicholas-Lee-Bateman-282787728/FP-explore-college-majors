2120085,5,B0002TSZQ0,"As other people have stated, watching this documentary is riviting, even more so because the drama is real and actually happened. The movie was OK and if I hadn't seen this first I would have thought it even better. Seeing tough-as-nails Gene Kranz choking up and getting teary-eyed over how close they came to losing the crew will affect any viewer watching it. Anyone interested in the space program that hasn't seen this documentary is missing out on what NASA was looking for in the beginning in their astronauts.... the Right Stuff.",1254096000,,537,4.8478260869565215
2120086,5,B0002TSZQ0,Apollo 13:To the Edge and Back-Accurate and Great!  I suggest buying this documentary and Apollo 13 IMAX to cover all bases on this important historical event.  This documentary will provide all the facts you need to know about this mission in order to check out the accuracy of the Ron Howard and Tom Hanks film.,1242604800,,313,4.672727272727273
2120087,5,B0002TSZQ0,"A 90-minute documentary telling the story of Apollo 13 from the point of view of those who experienced it; with testimony from Jim & Marilyn Lovell, Gene Kranz and others with a first-hand role.

Concentrating on events as they happened, the film does as much justice as possible to the story within the time allotted: more detail in the causes of the explosion would have been welcome, but difficult to squeeze in.

Overall, well worth seeing.",1168300800,6,444,4.828947368421052
2120088,5,B0002TSZQ0,"One of the best documentaries I've ever seen. If you're a space buff, and haven't seen this, get it. Told by the people who actually lived the experience, ""Apollo 13: To The Edge And Back"" is very well written and presented. Originally produced during the 25th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, this documentary was an influence on Ron Howard during the production of his movie ""Apollo 13"". ""To The Edge And Back"" also covers a little of the history of the U.S. space program and the causes and motivations for going to the moon. The technical aspects are clearly explained in terms the layman can easily understand. If you could only have one Apollo 13 documentary, let it be this one.",1123545600,22,690,4.663934426229508
2120089,5,B0002TSZQ0,"Though I love the movie Apollo 13 to death, I have to express an appreciation for this documentary, which covers the mission gone awry without the overdramatization that occurs in spots in the movie and manages to be almost as thrilling. This is in fact a great companion piece to the film, to get a notion of both what they got right (a surprising amount) and what they got wrong. Any space geek should have both in their library.",1120089600,12,431,4.468354430379747
2120090,5,B0002TSZQ0,"Nothing in the tamer ""Apollo 13"" movie lives up to the extraordinary tension and power of this documentary. Many things not covered in the thatrical film are here, so much so that my wife and I kept looking at each other with open mouths, wondering, ""How much ELSE could go wrong?!?"" It was while watching this presentation that we realized how truly heroic and ingenious the NASA folk were. We were limp from excitement after watching, ""To the Edge and Back"".",1112054400,14,460,4.691358024691358

2120123,5,B0002TSZQ0,"As good as the movie ""Apollo 13"" was, this documentary is even better, and the story is even more harrowing than presented in the movie.  This is a white-knuckle thriller at every turn.",1370995200,2,185,4.606060606060606
2120124,5,B0002TSZQ0,"Although my husband and I were not working this part of the Apollo Program, we were still proud Americans that we did so much - so many people working for the same goal, and proud of their country.!",1354924800,,198,4.2368421052631575
2120125,4,B0002TSZQ0,"An enjoyable DVD containing interviews I have not seen before.  More original footage/stills would be good, but a quality production nevertheless.",1349049600,3,146,5.9523809523809526
2120126,5,B0002TSZQ0,"This brilliant movie not only covers the Apollo 13 mission but also describes the historical context. We are presented with FACTS only: Real footage with little CGI and no dreadful reenactments of the events that took place. Furthermore, we get to see interviews with the actual astronauts, NASA engineers and other key persons of the time. A definite must see for any serious space cadet!! 5 stars and all thumbs up!!",1346803200,3,418,4.901408450704225

2120128,5,B0002TSZQ0,"Yep, this is a 5-star.  I'm usually very critical of documentaries, but this is a 5 star.  Great to have all 3 NOVA episodes in one DVD!  Very informative and enjoyable to watch.",1297728000,2,178,4.333333333333333

2120130,5,B0002TSZQ0,"These guys were truly heroes. The story is quite compelling and unrivalled by any fantasy novel. This was real life real time, no BS, life threatening stuff. A hard to put down book. The composure of these guys was admirable. The intellect of all involved was something to aspire to.",1270166400,,283,4.68

8031851,5,B0002TSZQ0,The best retelling of this crisis that I have watched. Much input from the astronauts and Mission Control folks that makes it every bit as suspenseful and tense as the Hollywood movie about this event.,1485388800,,201,4.771428571428571
8031852,5,B0002TSZQ0,"Rating this film five stars is an injustice. Because of the dynamic narration of Will Lyman, ""Apollo 13, To the Edge and Back,"" should get a 10-star rating. So, why spend money on the Hollywood movie of the Appolo 13 disaster, especially since ""To the Edge an Back"" is the real deal?",1471132800,2,283,4.461538461538462
