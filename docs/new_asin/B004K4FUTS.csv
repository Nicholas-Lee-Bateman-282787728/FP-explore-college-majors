4392320,5,B004K4FUTS,"Fantastic Set!  I've been waiting for A&E to finally put this WS out on the market.  Love that I can listen to Marcus/Smith instead of having to suffer the horrible ramblings of Tim McCarver and the boring calls of Joe Buck.  The Radio feed is a little jumpy here and there based on the editing, but it's fine because it syncs with the game perfectly which is all I could ask for.  I actually listened to the radio feed during the real games but had to deal with that 3 second tv delay.  Each and every disc cover has the entire box score, inning summaries and notable milestones from each game.  It doesn't have locker room celebrations but that's cool, I was smart enough to record all that on local SoCal stations back when it happened anyway.  I recommend this to all Angel Fans!",1327622400,,783,4.395833333333333
4392321,5,B004K4FUTS,"This was like I was there again. It brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart. I was transported to my favorite team's crowning achievement! It was so great, and a reasonable price! I think I will go and watch it again, right now!",1325203200,2,233,4.086956521739131
4392322,4,B004K4FUTS,"I want to say this is awesome to own because of all the history involved in post-season disappoinments for both teams and being to able to see Barry Bonds at his most awesome...But I can't call this this a perfect set, fo one simple reason...NO BONUS footage available...So don't expect a single highlight from any of the Angels prior playoff series or any post-game footage from the previous clinchers...Which to me is a big dissapointment because the World Series is not just about one series but other games and moments.  I would have liked to have seen the playoff clinchers included also the big innings in the Yankees and Twins series...Also maybe some parade coverage and post-game interviews from the other series wins...The pluses are the radio play by play which is highlighted by the late Rory Markas voice and there is pre-game and post-game coverage for each game which is different from other boxed set of Pro games series...The games don't just start with first pich and no set up and they don't end all of a sudden as well...So if you are a big Angels fan definetly get this but don't expect every great memory to be included from their post season run...And if anyone thinks I shouldn't expect this MLB has included bonus footage on most if not all of their box sets including older series where you would think such footage was lost to time...But this sets is from 2002 so there is plenty of footage available...",1317686400,9,1430,4.697211155378486
4392323,5,B004K4FUTS,The greatest World Series ever now available.  Plus the added bonus of being able to remove Jack Buck's son from the audio and replace him with the Angels own announcers.  I can't wait!!,1313107200,4,186,4.606060606060606
4392324,4,B004K4FUTS,Thunder Sticks and Rally Monkies! Yikes! I have to confess I don't recall a lot of this series. I remember the Angels being an exciting young team. The game six comeback sticks in my mind. I remember driving home from New York and listening to it on the radio. I thought for sure the 2002 baseball season was over. I will definetly add this to my collection. It will be great to fill in the blanks.,1312848000,5,398,4.25
4392325,4,B004K4FUTS,"This long waited product is finally being release this Oct (just before the 2011 playoff season).  As any So Cal OC fan knows, the fever and chills of every 2002 WS game was sheer sweat and excitement, and forever erased the pain of 1986.

As far as the product, be aware:

1) The timing of this release is couldn't be any worse.  I (and probably most of you reading this) will be watching the live current fall classic in Oct.  And if the Angels make it this post season, 2002 will be sitting on the shelf 'til winter when there's no MLB to watch.

2) A handful, or many if not all, other World Series Collections released by A&E include at least 1 game in the 1st or 2nd round of playoffs.  To have nothing from the NY or Minnesota series?  Especially the Yankees game 1 and 2, and Kennedy's 3-run blast off Twins were the turning points that set the stage for this series.

3) Blu ray release is a must nowadays.  HD and 16:9 DID exist in 2002.  This as DVD and 4:3 is like VHS in 2002.  Unacceptable.

4) There are no extras (no bonus materials).

The world series = 5 star.  This dvd set = 3 star.  Overall = 4 star.

Addendum 12/09/11.  You know that saying, ""save it for a rainy day""?  Well, I've been saving this to watch when the Angels have a bad year.  But now that the Halos just aquired C.J. Wilson and Fat Albert Pujols, this 2002 dvd set will have to continue waiting.  Sorry.  For those who are still considering this set, eventually it'll be a great $20 deal on Amazon just like all other W.S. sets.  So 'til then, hang in there and enjoy the upcoming 2012 season.",1312675200,5,2362,5.68

8432218,5,B004K4FUTS,My team. My one season of a championship. I cried then. I cry everytime I watch the end of game seven.,1504656000,,102,3.9047619047619047
8432219,5,B004K4FUTS,As an east coaster I'm not a big follower of these teams but I bought it because there were a number of high scoring games in the series and I love offense. The biggest surprise and perk of this dvd set are the highly animated and lively Angels announcers. The radio track is excellent with the announcers enthusiasms and the crowd noise which makes you feel you are right at the ball park. I don't bother with the Fox audio as by comparison is dull and it feels like the stadiums are empty. Very good and entertaining dvd set,1504656000,2,526,4.3232323232323235

8432221,3,B004K4FUTS,"As a Giants fan, I purchased this item to complete my collection of the three world series collections from this century. Unfortunately the 2002 collection only has the FOX TV announcers and the Angels radio broadcast, No Giants radio broadcast. The 2010 and 2012 collections had a choice of TV broadcast or the radio broadcast for both teams. The picture quality was not great. It reminded me of my old video tapes.",1407369600,,416,4.791666666666667
8432222,5,B004K4FUTS,"Packaged very well, detailed inning by inning on the CD case and good to excellent video and audio feeds.  I just hope for 2014 to be year of the Angels so I can actually attend and experience firsthand what that experience must of been like.",1394323200,,242,4.377777777777778
8432223,5,B004K4FUTS,This is the DVD collection to have of this great World Series. Every game is on individually cased DVD's with complete summary stats on inside and outside back cover. I am a Ben Weber fan (he grew up in my neighborhood) and I can go directly to every inning he pitches without having to search an entire DVD or set. Highly recommended. Excellent quality sound and video.,1393113600,,370,4.537313432835821
8432224,5,B004K4FUTS,I am pretty sure I made wife of the year finding this for my husband. He loves the Angels and always makes a comment around World Series time how the Angels never released their World Series games on DVD. So when he opened this he was very happy! Thank you!,1375660800,,257,4.16
8432225,5,B004K4FUTS,Awesome and fantastic. Well worth the money! I would definitely recommend it to those sports fans of the SF giants !,1371427200,3,116,4.571428571428571
8432226,5,B004K4FUTS,"My boyfriend had been wanting this for awhile and was really excited to receive it for Christmas.  It comes in seven single disks-each one representing a game in the World Series that year.  Being an Amazon Prime member, I received it very quickly, and was very satisfied with this purchase.",1358208000,2,291,4.8
