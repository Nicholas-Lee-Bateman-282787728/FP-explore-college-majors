like musicals (especially at such a high technical level) see

this one.  There is no DVD, but I for one would get it without

4718294,2,B005KR6O1C,"IN A NUTSHELL: SINCE WE ALL KNOW ABOUT SHANGRI-LA I'LL SKIP THE INTRO

An excellent novel by James Hilton that was made into a five star 1937 epic was remade into this audio/video extravaganza that fails to work despite having a terrific cast and production crew.

WHAT WENT WRONG:

There are songs by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, and many of the best, and most celebrated actors of the twentieth century. However, even with actors and songwriters, you still need a director and a script. For brevity, here's a list of some of what went wrong;

---*- 1]- The entire story lacks a consistent and believable perspective to give the audience a reason for the ""leap of faith"" necessary in any film that has as its star a place called ""Shangri-La"".

---*- 2]- The bloated 150 minute playing time is filled with obviously dubbed-in voices, wailing Bacharach's worst, and most forgettable movie music. The dubbed-in voices were uniformly weak during each musical number. The music also stopped rather than furthered the action and plot, something that Disney has managed to get right for decades -- recall Snow White, Mary Poppins, The Jungle Book, or Aladdin?

---*- 3]- The actors all had tough acts to follow, but presumably that also meant that they had something to assist them in understanding their roles since they had all been done before and done well. Nevertheless, the stars, including, Peter Finch and John Gielgud, as Conway and Chang, needed better material, like the characters in the original epic had, to make the unavoidable long speeches as concise and enlightening as possible. This is even more important for Charles Boyer as ""The High Lama"", because the interactions between these three characters make or break this film. In this case it broke it. Nevertheless, the acting by all these fine actors was not fine in this film. In essence, the entire cast managed to embarrass themselves.

---*- 4]- Choreography -- with tacky sets and poorly executed numbers the less said about the choreography, the better.

---*- 5]- The look of the film was very 1970s in every way. Costume, sets, and cinematic style all looked very dated.

---*- 6]- Apparently poor direction by the filmmakers.

BOTTOM LINE: SEE THIS VERSION IF YOU ARE CURIOUS: BUT THE 1937 EPIC IS ON DVD

Yes, this is a very poor remake and a huge production to boot. While I do feel that the theme of ""Lost Horizon"" is better served by the original 1937, Frank Capra production, there is no reason not to see this film if one is curious. I certainly don't regret seeing this remake if only to appreciate the original more.",1142208000,13,3470,4.896193771626297

4718329,5,B005KR6O1C,"Surprisingly, the critics hardly praised this truly feel good film from the 70s. Granted, the musical numbers are a bit awkward & choppy ; however, this is still one of my all time favorite films. The film would have been enjoyable on it's own, but I find that the music lightens & lifts the movie to a new height. There are so many films with a dystopian storyline. How refreshing to watch one about utopia! And I love Olivia Hussey in a charming turn as Maria. She is absolutely luminous !!! Interestingly, she portrayed Juliet & Michael York portrayed Tybalt in Romeo and Juliet. They have a nice dynamic in this film. Although one may argue that it's a bit on the 70s cheesy side, this is still one of my guilty pleasures, and I enjoy it each time I watch it. Pass the popcorn !!!",1501372800,,784,4.376712328767123

4718334,5,B005KR6O1C,"This is the second film version of the James Hilton classic novel. See my review of the 1937 version, which is generally considered better than this musical from 1973. I plan to read the novel and I will write a review of it. Contrary to what is advertised, this musical is based more on the 1937 movie more than on the book. For example, in the book, the hero Hugh Conway is not a very high British official, in the films he is very high. Also in the films, Conway is accompanied to Shangri-La by his brother, who is not in the book. Furthermore, although in the films one of the three people accompanying Conway is a sick woman who recovers her health in Shangri-La, the woman in the book is a healthy missionary. These and other changes in the film add drama.
Conway discovers that the inhabitants of the city live in peace. The rule in this paradise is that one must be kind, respect others, and be moderate in everything, even in regard to virtue itself. Thus, a person can be a moderate liar. There is no money in the city. The mountains have gold, but the inhabitants have no need of it. Remarkably, the climate is such that people live in Shangri-La for a long time. The founder is over two hundred years old. Beside the climate, the lack of stress, worry, and strife in the city, replaced by tranquility, contributes to the health of the population. Animals in Shangri-La walk about without fear. We see deer in the street. There are birds flying about. People are told that if they leave Shangri-La they will age and die.
What is unique about this musical version is that there is lots of nice singing and dancing. It is a pleasure to watch, even after seeing the 1937 version.",1500508800,,1687,4.445161290322581

4718338,5,B005KR6O1C,"An excellent classic film which everyone should be sure to see. I won't go into a review of the film itself as that has been done by others. My comments are about this restored Blu-ray version of the original film from 1937. First of all to reassure everyone, although this Blu-Ray is from the Australian release of the remastered 4K restoration scan, it plays perfectly on US Blu-Ray machines Region A/1 as well as the Region B/1 blu-ray machines. This is by far the best restoration of the film and adds a couple of additional minutes of previously lost film footage not included in previous releases. There are still about 5 minutes of lost video in this blu-ray from the original 1937 release of the film. The restorers have included the full audio track in the film and have inserted still photos from the film in the missing areas and the effect is not objectionable all. While the film is about as pristine as it can be, it is not as sharp as some old restored classic movies (e.g.: Casablanca)  but that is due to the age of the film and it is far, far better than any other previous version of the film. Sound quality is excellent as well. Would absolutely recommend this Blu-ray to all. One of the bonus features on this disc is an alternate ending which was only shown in the first 2 weeks when the film was originally released and was demanded by the studio. The Director ultimately prevailed and his desired ending replaced the Studio Head's version. You can compare the two versions and can see that the Capra ending was the correct one.",1496793600,5,1551,4.539285714285715

And while you're at it read Hilton's ""Random Harvest""... then see Colman in Random Harvest. One of those times the movie is far better than the book. And I'm a Hilton fan, too.

Looking at it today, older and wiser, I think the main problems are the pace being too slow, the script needs more interesting plot twists (rather than assorted love stories) and it needed at least one strong lead singer (e.g., Julie Andrews in ""The Sound of Music."")  Yes you can have a superior musical with singers of only modest talent (""Singin' in the Rain"") but it helps to have a Streisand, Andrews or vocal double (Marnie Nixon singing for Audrey Hepburn in ""My Fair Lady"") to meet the audiences minimum expectations.  If you see any musical on Broadway today, even the secondary characters can sing better than the leads here. The more recent (2008) ABBA Musical ""Mamma Mia!"" suffered the same dismal box office performance for the lack of at least one Broadway-caliber singer.  On DVD or BluRay you can fast forward through the overly drawn out scenes to condense the movie to a tuneful 90 minutes.

4718415,2,B005KR6O1C,"Since I had already watched the original (1937) version several times (not in 1937, since I was not born yet, in about 1954) and again in recent years, and read the novel several times, I have very definite opinions about the work and the whole concept of Shangri-La, as a Utopian place.
This version was made in 1972, though I somehow never heard of it until this month. It had some name actors: GEorge Kennedy, Liv Ullman, Michael York, whom I had at least heard of. And Charles Boyer, whom I remember as being famous in the 1950's.
But the movies was junk. Silly. A bad imitation of the original. The characters seem to me to act like this was a rehearsal not the real thing - speaking their lines, like they were reciting them to get them memorized,  laughing when nothing was funny.  Liv Ullman - I think it was her - the cool, composed, slightly bored-by-the-whole thing sophisticated lady at the beginning - who was the missionary in the book and a psycholoigical case in the old movie, a maladjusted personality who should not have found herself in this remote corner of the world where an adventure was getting ready to go down - she became a basket case as soon as the plane took off with the co-adventurers and was bouncing around on the updafts and downdrafts and was going to commit suicide as soon as they were rescued and safe in the warm monastery of Shangri-La with central heating and gourmet food and exquisite clothing -
or maybe she was not really going to jump - Chang intervened and talked her down, though she might have not had the courage to. She is not sure.
Michael York does a competent job of playing in incompetent, bumbling, high-energy, exciteable young man who only wants to get out of Shangri=La.back to civilization.  George Kennedy over-plays his role. Trying too hard. Like on the plane when they are getting rescued out of the chaos  and violence of the revolution, he is gruff and given to one-word lines and silent stares - like he is a man to be reckoned with, someone with a past, as we later learn. And when he discovers gold  GOLD! Just laying around in the streams waiting for someone like him to discover.... then so what? Since he elects to stay there and ll his whooping and holloring about it are for nothing anyway.
The plot is weak and the actors are poor. The screen-play, if that it what it is called, is unpolished, like  a first draft.
But worse than all that is  the singing. Singing !!? Yes they sing. It is not exactly a musical i think. But they added to all this singing - by people who do not obviously sing -  to distract from the weak plot and poor actors maybe. Music by Burt Bacherat ? I remember him. From movies long ago.
They sing at the worst times and it disrupts the viewer's concentration on trying to figure out what the plot is. And they sing badly.
And the Tibetan monks - who are supposed to be Chinese and Tibetan - look like plain old European-descent Americans. Maybe they were people who were hanging around the movie grounds and they got hired to fill in to save on the budget.
Don't watch this movie, If you care at all about the wondrous story of Shangri-La, the place where people live long lives in peace and harmony,
then don't spoil your image of it by watching this silly 1/2 musical thing.",1479254400,,3279,4.453333333333333

The Capra version is head and shoulders above this one.  For instance, Lovey in the Capra  version (played by Edward Everett Horton), is a paleontologist and very, very funny and almost steals the movie. The same character in this 1973 version is a comic -- and not funny.  Charles Boyer's performance, as the High Llama, does not even come close to that of Sam Jaffe's who instilled a sense of the eternal and the threat of a coming apocalypse.  There is a magic in the Shangri-La of Frank Capra that this one sadly lacks. And even Finch, who brings a wonderful sense of dignity to the role, pales compared to the simmering intensity of Ronald Coleman.",1428105600,,797,4.617021276595745

4718581,5,B005KR6O1C,"This gorgeously colored high mountain Shangri-la is a pleasure to the eyes and to those with a sense of humor about hippie ideas as played out in 1970' s lingo and flowing costumes and long hair and Asian religious ideas.

Naturally this is based on a book and a very famous one in its time. 1930'S was a time of Depression and foreboding and the population lent itself to fantasy fiction.  James Hilton, who wrote 'GOODBYE MR CHIPS', hit a home run with this tale of a hidden valley of warm weather aend peaceful harmonious living high in the Himalayas.  It was a utopia of people living well and having no money system yet with plenty to eat a d exceptionally long lives until well over 100 years simply because for stress of modern living was absent.  Illness they were often spared because nonoutside diseases came to them.  A high lama was in charge and people knew their places.

One cannot help but observe that the leaders live very well and in leisure while the common man and often the women haul water up from a river very tediously with buckets on their heads.  Communist ideas were powerful in the 1930'S.

The origin Al black and white film is still considered the classic.  Here we have a remake turning it into a musical.  It seems like a cross between Hair! And Star Trek and a Japanese tea garden all rolled into one.  This remake follows the book closely.

John Gielgud plays the high lama in beautiful flowing gowns of the Tibetan toe who welcomes his five new arrivals.  They are malcontents and cynical types who have fled china to avoid The Japanese.  Their small airplane crashes in a snow blizzard and they appear doomed to freeze there.  The next morning arrives dozens of men on fur coats to take them to Shangri-la by treacherous mountain paths.  You can feel their delight and amazement to enter a tunnel and arrive ana sprawling green valley of gardens and happy and healthy people in glorious sunshine.  Yes it is a commune in California!  No it is Esalen on Highway 1. It is paradise!

The singing throughout is by Burt Bacharach and more silly and sentimental it cannot get.  Yet it is so campy that one is fascinated by the idea of completely simple and innocent isolated people happily doing their chores in communistic comrsdsrie.  Thorn they sing vaguely asiastic ideas about life going in circles and perform a big crow. Of a fertility dance.  The men are in charge and at their vaguely Japanese style meals the entertainment consists of Caucasian women in Confucianism robes dancing laconically as if on LSD.

Peter Finch plays the most rational and levelheaded of these wayfarers who appreciates the peace and beset eauty of the lifestyle. Michael York is the young and habdsime reporter who desperately wants to get back to civilization.  Liv Ullman is a young aristocratic woman who is just eaitjng for love as she floes about idly and beatifucslly smiling on the laboring masses.

My favorite is Peggy Lipton in her Mod Squad glory depressed and malcontented and moaning to her guru counselor who tells her that the answer is within herself. It is so 1970's campy sometimes you will laugh aloud if you remember those yearning daze.

Enjoy this film for its wonderfully effervvescant hippie aura of chanting music and wavy dances and beautiful colors and costumes and Eastern philosophical announcements about life and its communistic yet Animal farm ambiance.

I have decided to read the book now so I am not distracted so much by Peggy Lipton.",1427760000,,3487,4.720661157024794

4718631,1,B005KR6O1C,"This rating //is// for the movie. Had it not been a musical, I might have given it two stars.

One of the high points of the Medveds' ""50 Worst Movies of All Time"" is their trashing of this color musical remake of Frank Capra's 1937 film. As getTV (Sony/Columbia's cable channel) was showing it (preceded by the original) yesterday, I plopped down in front of the TV in expectation of a truly dreadful experience. I was not disappointed -- by either film.

The world didn't need a musical version of ""Lost Horizon"" -- and certainly not this one. (One wonders what Ashman & Menken might have done with it.) Hal David's inane, empty, stupid, clumsy, idiotic lyrics would have had to struggle mightily to reach the level of simple mediocrity. They're far more risible than cringe-inducing. My laughter was accompanied by an overwhelming desire to heave rocks at the screen.

Hermes Pan's * choreography is equally inane. Much of it seems ""dumbed down"" for people who aren't dancers, but even Bobby Van's dance number is pretty lame.

Need I add that the flatly lit color cinematography (by Robert Surtees, of all people) works against the story; the costumes seem wildly inappropriate; and the lamasery interiors too-often resemble something out of an upscale motel?

Though the critical scorn heaped on this film was richly deserved, it has to be seen in the light of people's sentimental feelings about the ""classic"" original. The original //wasn't// a classic -- it's nearly as bad. The Capra version is an uneasy mixture of not-overly profound drama with cheap humor (supplied mostly by Edward Everett Horton's and Thomas Mitchell's characters). The Robert Riskin screenplay apparently softens and sentimentalizes the hard edges of the novel. (Surprised?)

Had Ross Hunter decided to produce a film closer to the novel, without songs & dances, and with an appropriate, sober approach, the remake would have been justified. Instead, he had Larry Kramer adapt the original script (most of the dialog is copied verbatim), without fixing the things that weakened the original. The broad emotions and occasional over-acting of a 1937 film were acceptable then. They were not acceptable in a 1973 film.

""Lost Investment"" (as it was dubbed) is the embodiment of ""ill-conceived"", on every level.

I might add that, as Jane Wyatt aged very gracefully, it would have been amusing for her to have played the same character in the remake.

But, it was very nice to rediscover one of my favorite movies from my teens, and to introduce it to my wife. I'm not the biggest musical fan, but it works well here. It's worthy of note to point out that the singing only happens when in shangri-la - it's helps delineate a magical realm like how changing from sepia to color, and back, in the Wizard of Oz helps to delineate between the real world (sepia) and the mystical (color).

Despite its fine cast, first class Hollywood production and Bacharach/David songs, this 1973 film flopped at the box office. I think the cynical audience of that period was done with big-budget glossy old-school musicals.  Changing tastes called for gritty and more realistic movies.  And the supercilious critics were quite harsh.  I saw the movie in 1973 at the theatre and as a kid, it blew me away with the awesome wide-screen, lavish production, and great music.

Now viewing Lost Horizon some 40 years later, it still looks pretty good to me.  A cinematic masterpiece? No. But still an entertaining show with a wonderful message.

Olivia Hussey and Micheal York, who had previously appeared together in Franco Zeferelli's ""Romeo and Juliet,"" are part of the all star cast (for 1970s) as young lovers.  Meanwhile, the great Peter Finch and Liv Ullman, provide insight that love can strike at any age.  This was also one of the last movies of Bobby Van--incredible dancer and comedian.

It combines nail-biting adventure, heartbreaking drama, and two love stories -one turning out good, the other bad, with the violent and illogical world of today juxtaposed upon an ethereal Himalayan Utopia where brotherly love reigns supreme. Sadly, some just don't ""get"" this movie due to the incongruous 1970's variety show music that suddenly pops out of nowhere.  However, I say that the music is what makes this movie REALLY WORK and helps it reach the modern day heart. The viewer should remember that this movie was contemporary with  ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" -a blockbuster movie that featured incongruous and anything but ""Western"" theme music (Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head).  The hope was that this movie would be similarly successful by combining universal themes and desires for love and brotherhood with modern-day (70's) musical showmanship.  Burt Bacharach was at his best with the lilting (sometimes silly) but absolutely mesmerizing music in this movie.  Don't let the naysayers get you down.  Revel in the beauty of this movie.

I even thought it was dorky back when I first saw this in a movie theater when I was 13.
But along with the bad music there is a desire for the world to be a better place. It is cheesy, but it has a kind of warmth to it and can be very moving at times, especially when Finch is trudging through the snow and suddenly sees a landmark that he knows will lead him back to Shangri-La.
There is a very good  anti-war message in this, though are  a lot of unanswered questions. Is the Peter Finch character taking refuge from that crazy war- torn world world rather to try to change it? Maybe sometimes it is necessary to simply survive and emerge later?(Of course,in the movie there's that problem with extreme old age if you stay too long...)
Very relevant issues for our own time. Perhaps more relevant than ever.",1388880000,,1169,4.3577981651376145
4718719,5,B005KR6O1C,"I saw ""Lost Horizon"" in NYC..the world premier, and the Columbis ""bosses"" were there dunbfounded and asking each other how to cut the film, change the title maybe. What to do with this Lost Investment?""This film was put out in the dys of Viet Nam and Nixon and Klute and Carnal Knowledge, The Devils, ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller,"" etc. How could Lost Hrizon do anything at the Box Office? The ""bosses "" should have known better.

Liv Ullman had just done Cries and Whispers for Ingmar Bergman and had been seen in the great ""Passion of Anna,"" a more seering examination of small minds at work to do evil you cannot find.

Then Liv did Lost Horizon and all hell fell on her and the rest of the cast. Barbra Streisand had made ""On a Clear Day..."", ""Paint Your Wagon"" had crash landed, ""Hello Dolly"" was crucified by critics. But Lost Horizon captured many people off guard and I , along other riends, saw it a few times more. It's holding on to itself with barte hands. Brilliant risk,

This Lost Horizon musical actually has great edge to it, a feeling of false hopes pushed at you through Burt Bacarach's muisc and Hal David's depressing lyrics. Everyhting 'is desperate, shrill, lost indeed. It is very apocalyptic as the ones who depart sense that the world below them is unsafe, terrible as Olivia Hussey dissolves into old age and death in  a matter of hours.. When Peter Finch returns to Shangrila, it is to the plastic, reality-denying world of no change, no really human existence. But Shangrila promises security, a kind of world without substantial thoughts. This musical version and the Capra version bolth assert Shangrila as Utopia..nolwhere, and perhaps not the best place to be despite the struggles in the world beyond.

The music is loud and hectic, with desperate, clumsy lyrics, deliberately written to show the precarious nature of this larger than life Asian Disneyland. But it is necessary, the oxygen required for love,for any human or spritual connection compared to the death like-life beyond the Horizon.  Dependance on a macabre idea of immortality as seen through the High Lama and his pitiable longevity. must sustain them. The music carries this dread with it. Many of the songs are dubbed for Finch and Ullmann. The others are thrown at you, and Hussey does one of the heaviest twirls ever filmed..its like the  Toten Tanz, Dance of Death. I think that it is deliberate. Jarrott who directed is no fool..he gave us Anne of the 1000 Days, a very unnerving film, spectacular performances and that fear again that silence, ""the world cannot help you"" theme.

This is a totally romantic, amusing and entertaining musical with serious over-tones.  You know the story-line.  I also own the soundtrack and love it just as much as the movie.  If you love musicals, give this one a try.  It's wonderful and will leave you with a warm and happy feeling.  If you love it, also buy the soundtrack.

4718722,2,B005KR6O1C,"This poor, overproduced spectacle should be obligatory viewing for teaching how NOT to write a musical.

1. For starters, Larry Kramer's script progresses for 40 minutes of straight action-adventure without a song in sight. By the time the first song appears (as sung and danced by Olivia Hussey as Shangri-La's dinner entertainer), the suspension of belief one needs to accept a reality where people can burst into song and dance is shattered. (Think of how West Side Story creates an alternate reality of song and dance in the gritty streets of New York from the very beginning.)

2. The songs by Burt Bacharach and Hal David (the worst possible composing team for this project) are truly bland, stupid, and ultimately terrible examples of New Wave-type pop. The musical Oklahoma! by Rodgers and Hammerstein was notable for showing us that music, lyrics, song and dance, can contribute to plot development while they propel the musical toward its conclusion.  An even finer example, since it also deals with a mythical place, would be Brigadoon. In Lost Horizon, the songs all sit like a lump and do nothing to advance the story. In fact, they could easily be cut  to turn this film into a straight fantasy drama, as was the original 1937 classic. At the same time, dramatic places to put songs are completely ignored. If you know the show Brigadoon, for example, you practically dissolve in tears by the time Fiona sings to her lover as he's leaving, perhaps forever: ""Why must you go, Tommy, when you're all I'm living for?"" In Lost Horizon, you won't even find a song when Peter Finch as Richard Conway leaves his lover Catherine (Liv Ullmann) in a nearly identical situation.

3. If you can't forget the truly horrible choreography by Hermes Pan, you might try to concentrate instead on the fact that the entire crew of shirtless male dancers have shaved their armpits. Why????

As for the DVD, one can appreciate the nice color combinations and the nice print, even if the Shangri-La sets do look like a back lot. And all the performers are individually worth watching as they try their damndest to put this clinker across. You should definitely watch this one time, at least, as a learning experience.

Amazing creatures these critics....

Now that I've got all that out of the way I'm proudly proclaiming that ""Lost Horizon"" is my favourite musical.  I have read Hilton's book but I enjoyed this musical version a lot more.  I'm also a big Bacharach-David fan and for years I had to put up with just the soundtrack and a poorly preserved VHS that I recorded off the television many, many years ago so imagine my utter joy when this excellent blu ray with great picture and 5.1 surround sound qualities came out!  It looks like a completely different movie when compared with my VHS and for fans this is a dream come true.  Like most fans I loved the film's premise and I thought the cast did a great job.  I love the songs as well and I think people are too harsh on David for the lyrics.  Tracks like ""The World is a Circle"" and ""Question Me an Answer"" have quirky lyrics but we have to remember the context where these are meant to be children's songs sung in a sort of kindergarten and so what do you expect?  How many nursery rhymes from mother goose had lyrics that are much better?  Goosey goosey gander?  Little Jack Horner?  The rest of the tracks had very meaningful and more adult lyrics such as the one that opens the film and the love songs.  This release is also the full version which has more footage than what one usually sees on television.

To conclude and to take a little poetic licence from ""The Song of Bernadette"": for fans no explanation is necessary; for film snobs no explanation is possible and as far as I'm concerned not necessary either.

It's as if you were on that plane yourself and transported to some weird OTHER WORLD. Anyway, I loved it then and I'm so happy to finally have a copy of this peculiar little gem. I know not EVERYONE will feel that way about it, but I do. Thank you Burt and Ross. It's still nice to get away from it all. :-)",1361577600,6,752,4.053691275167785

4718790,3,B005KR6O1C,"Some studios never learn. Having nearly bankrupted the studio when Frank Capra's 1937 version went massively over budget and struggled to recoup its investment as they desperately cut the film again and again to get more shows in, 36 years later Columbia Pictures did the same thing all over again with producer Ross Hunter's version of Lost Horizon, this time adding songs in an era when musicals were bombing left right and centre and filling the cast with people who couldn't sing. It's not the first musical adaptation - there had already been a flop Broadway musical in 1956 and a TV version in 1960 called Shangri-La - but it's the one that has gone down in movie infamy that extensive re-editing did nothing to stem. The cuts started after the first previews, losing 23 minutes and most of its $12.8m budget by the time it ended its run, but surprisingly Sony have restored the film to its full 149-minute roadshow version in a rather splendid DVD-R release and a limited edition Blu-ray from Twilight Time that even more surprisingly features a wealth of extras.

It's easy to see the appeal of the project in the turbulent 70s, when studios were torn between low-budget films aimed at the disaffected and big-budget flops trying to lure their parents back into theatres with nostalgia. Despite hints at the Vietnam war and political unrest back in the civilised world, it's the same story with the same universal appeal to people's desire for an eternal haven of peace on Earth that never translated into ticket sales when dramatised. It's at its best outside Shangri-La when it plays a glossy drama, with Peter Finch's philosophical diplomat and his sundry companions - younger brother Michael York, George Kennedy's engineer, sally Kellerman's depressed reporter and Bobby Van's song and dance man - finding their last plane out of an Asian civil war hijacked and crashing in the mountains of Tibet. Luckily it's not long before John Gielgud turns up in bad Tibetan makeup from the nearest Lamasery and, after a trek through the ice they find themselves in Camelot, which has had a superficial facelift since Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave moved out and is now calling itself Shangri-La...

And that's when the problems start. Capra's film struggled to find the drama in the middle section as the valley's secret was uncovered and its hero faced with the choice of a haven from strife in a world where time is almost meaningless or returning to the chaos of the modern world where his ideas meet with approving sounds but are never acted upon. It had been assumed that some of the problems were down to the re-editing, but the restored version does little to improve matters. Perhaps what's most curious about it is how appropriately relaxed the pace is while at the same time never getting round to showing things we really should be seeing or finding out about - the cause of Kellerman's despair, the growing romance between Finch and Liv Ullman (who doesn't get a proper scene with Finch until 111 minutes into the film!) or York and Olivia Hussey, the growing suspicions about their arrival in Shangri-La... Instead it just marks time with the odd musical number along the way. And there's at least one very odd musical number back in the picture now.

The most notorious of the cuts has been restored, the quite jaw dropping fertility dance performed in the middle of the Living Together, Growing Together number by what looks like a bunch of oiled-up refugees from Muscle Beach in dayglo orange loincloths. Camp doesn't even begin to describe it, Hermes Pan's choreography (basically ripping off the opening of La Bayadaire without the exciting bits) not just coming out of the closet but chopping it up into matchsticks and making tiny pink parasols out of them. And it's still one of the dance highlights of the film thanks to cast who often fare even worse dancing than they do singing - poor old Liv Ullman's big number simply sees her waving her arms and legs from side to side in a slightly less ambitious version of the `white guy dance' demonstrated by uncoordinated drunken dudes in nightclubs around the world every weekend.

Burt Bacharach and Hal David's songs are less than outstanding, to put it mildly, the kind of 70s easy listening where the word easy seems not just wildly overoptimistic but downright misleading. On the verge of dissolving their partnership at the time, they reek of contractual obligation with odd moments of professionalism that almost work while never rising above the standard of a weak 70s TV variety show (even Ross Hunter acknowledged ""it was a bum score""). The ideas aren't bad - one duet has two characters singing their thoughts over an innocuous scene - but the execution often is: after 40 song-free minutes, the film jumps into the first big number, The World is a Circle, so clumsily it's like someone got the reels in the wrong order and turned the volume up to 11 while Peter Finch's big soul-searching number is an exercise in agony as he changes key mid-word and can't even talk his way through the quieter moments a la Rex Harrison (he's reputedly dubbed, but for some reason they seem to have chosen his voice on the grounds of sounding like Finch rather than being able to sing any better). Worse, they're mostly showstoppers in the worst sense, having so little to do with plot or character that you could cut most of them out and never miss a thing.

Even technically it's less impressive than a film that cost so much should be. While Columbia's epics often had a handsome look, once this gets away from the decent mountain location work and arrives at Shangri-La, the film has more of the in-house look of a cheap Universal comedy film from the late 60s-early 70s, which isn't so surprising considering producer Ross Hunter and forgotten A-list director Charles Jarrott were both big noises on the Universal lot. Yet somehow, despite the miscasting, despite the bad singing, despite the under-developed screenplay and all the missed opportunities, some of the magical yearning of James Hilton's novel survives, making the film a curious mix between a guilty pleasure and an underdog you want to give a second chance. It doesn't repay that chance particularly well, but there's still something there...

While it's a shame that Columbia have only released this special edition as a Region 1 NTSC manufactured-on-demand DVD-R, it's an impressive widescreen transfer and the extras are plentiful and welcome: an alternate version of one musical number, I Come to You, vintage featurette Ross Hunter on the Road to Shangri-La, Ross Hunter's introductions to a promo reel presentation for US cinema managers, 8 song demos by Burt Bacharach, 2 TV spots, teaser trailer and full theatrical trailer. All but the introductions to the promo reel (which largely repeat material in the featurette in between telling you how great a scene that's no longer included is) have been carried over to Twilight Time's excellent region-free limited edition (3000 copies only) Blu-ray pressing, which also includes an isolated score track, booklet and an excellent widescreen transfer and is definitely the version for fans to track down.",1361404800,7,7199,4.906403940886699

4718808,5,B005KR6O1C,"When I was a little child, my mother had a well-worn copy of James Hilton's novel, LOST HORIZON. She had seen the original film when it first was released in 1937, and she always spoke of ""Shangri-La"" with a yearning in her tone of voice. Naturally curious about what had captured her imagination, I in was sucked into the dream, through the book, the original film, the radio drama, the musical remake, the laserdisc, the DVD and now the blu-ray, which arrived today. I experienced doubt about indulging in the blu-ray. What more, I thought, could it add to the Pioneer Special Edition letterboxed Laserdisc, or the widescreen DVD-R release of October 2011? Well, I didn't procrastinate long, and the blu-ray arrived today. Immediately I was grabbed with the giant leap taken from the last release to this one. The picture is more stable, but still suffers from blurring in rapid motion portions of the screen; that is a common failing of all home video formats, and blu-ray is not exempt from it; possibly the new 48 fps format in which The Hobbit has been released will finally solve that problem. No, the big improvement on the blu-ray is the soundtrack. The score sounds big and full, seriously enhancing the drama of the screenplay. The greatest benefit is felt with the songs, better orchestrated and less cheesy overall. This is not one of the great musicals of all time, but with this kind of loving care the spirit of the film is set free to work its magic. Many a great classic film is still waiting in line to receive the kind of classy treatment that the 1973 LOST HORIZON has just received. The film rises in one's estimation as a result.",1357171200,12,1652,4.660958904109589
4718809,5,B005KR6O1C,Saw this as a teen in the theatres. The reaction of the movie goers was humorous as each time a musical number began people were rolloing their eyes or sighing. I loved the musical numbers. Happy I have this movie now.,1357171200,2,218,4.341463414634147
4718810,3,B005KR6O1C,"Twilight Time's December releases include a limited-edition Blu-Ray of LOST HORIZON, the expensive Columbia Pictures musicalization of the late `30s Frank Capra classic (itself an adaptation of James Hilton's novel), that has long been tagged as one of Hollywood's costliest turkeys. Burt Bacharach and Hal David, then at the top of the pop charts with dozens of classic tunes under their belt, penned the songs for this ill-fated Ross Hunter production which - along with other unfortunate endeavors of the era (Fox's Julie Andrews musical ""Star!"" among them) - helped put the final nails in the genre's coffin for some time to come.

The film isn't awful -- but, frankly, it's pretty close. Admirers of ""Lost Horizon"" tend to fall into two camps: folks who believe the film is really, honestly good, and others who gain pleasure from its campiness, awkward (and occasionally awful) performances and seriously bad choreography. It doesn't help that the score itself is mostly forgettable, and certainly not up to the level of Bacharach-David's more memorable collaborations. Director Charles Jarrott (later to helm ""The Other Side of Midnight"" and Disney's ""Condorman""), meanwhile, struggles to hold it all together, capturing the plastic (if colorful) cinematography and dated `70s fashions in all of their gaudy widescreen splendor while cast members Peter Finch, Michael York, Sally Kellerman, George Kennedy, Olivia Hussey, Bobby Van, Charles Boyer and John Gielgud either give it their all -- or seem faintly embarrassed -- to be a part of a genre few of them were particularly renowned for. It's certainly a unique viewing experience, though since I fall into the viewership who enjoys the film for its faults, I would recommend anyone sample ""Lost Horizon"" first before jumping into its odd universe of old-fashioned melodrama, `70s platitudes, easy-going music and (mostly) poor performances.

Reconstructed on laserdisc back in the heyday of the format by Pioneer, ""Lost Horizon"" made its first DVD appearance just over a year ago as part of Sony's manufactured-on-demand catalog. Utilizing that same master, Twilight Time's Sony-licensed 1080p AVC encoded transfer is exceptionally strong, boasting vivid detail and a pleasing, natural appearance. The 5.1 DTS MA audio track is highly satisfying with its broad stereophonic sound stage, though I'll let fans more knowledgeable with the material compare it to past exhibitions they may have heard (an isolated score mix is, of course, also included). Extra features are carried over from the Sony release, including over 20 minutes of Bacharach song demos, a vintage 10 minute promotional featurette with Hunter, an alternate version of the ""I Come to You"" number, trailers/TV spots and Julie Kirgo's booklet notes. In all, this is a Blu-Ray sure to please ""Lost Horizon""'s fans.",1356825600,5,2839,5.348993288590604

This could be the vision of how we can live if it were not for true evil.

4718829,2,B005KR6O1C,"Ross Hunter made the mistake of touting this film as his greatest, and really didn't know yet what he had let himself in for.  In 1973, everyone had a good idea of what ""turning on"" meant and this musical was clearly seen as the venue to make an original Hollywood extravaganza that would appeal to those many who were ""looking into themselves for their inner beauty.""  Weren't all the fashionable movie stars turning to a maharishi for enlightenment?  I recently read James Hilton's novel and was anxious to see an original Hollywood musical of it, hoping for, at best, some of ""The Sound of Mucus"" or at least ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips.""  The result of this was the worst musical I have ever seen and one that does not seem to be saying what it is teaching.  Hunter got all the best to work on it:  Robert Surtees to photograph it; Jean Louis (who clothed Lana Turner) to design all those nehru jackets; Hermes Pan to choreograph it (I still can't believe the inept result of that); or was it because the actors weren't particularly musically inclined?  Sally Kellerman could dance at a disco I'm sure, but her moves on her big number, ""Reflections"" are embarrassingly bad.  And she sings it to an aging George Kennedy, who she is contrived to have a rather flippant love interest.  He is terribly miscast and also totally unbelievable to be embarrassing.  Bobby Van, perhaps the only musically inclined of the cast plays a ""corny comedian"" and it is the inclusion of this corny old-school Hollywood showbiz pap that makes you long for Red Buttons who should have been cast.  Also miscast now a seeming has-been but then highly revered star material of Liv Ullman (who probably felt she could do something other than being ultimately bland after then having ""Forty Carats"" under her belt).  I wish her character were completely not there.  Peter Finch could not sing either, but he was actually came out one of the better as were Michael York (he seemed more like Peter Finch's son than his brother) and especially Olivia Hussey, whose dancing scenes even with Sally Kellerman in a very dully conceived duet (""The Nice Things I Won't Miss"") she seemed better at.  Charles Boyer was the high lama and John Geilgud and James Shigita were also cast.  And he hired Burt Bacharach to conduct and write the songs with Hal David.  None of them became standards, rightfully so, they seem like they were written for the caliber of ""Sesame Street.""  The direction by Charles Jarrott is so pedestrian and uninspired, especially in the supposedly thrilling world outside revolt scenes, with arms raised in fists in the air presenting a stagnant and nonthreatening sign of the turmoil.  And the end result does not make one want to go back to stay like an Oz that was always there to mentor Hunter.  Hunter died in 1996.  I wonder if he ever survived his ""Lost Horizon"" successfully.",1342915200,2,2866,4.7283702213279675

I came across an lp of the original motion picture score recently and immediately fell to it. Of course I had to acquire the film and the result couldn't have been more perfect. I vaguely recall ABC showing this a few years after its release on their Sunday Movie night, but wasn't interested at the time. It never occurred to me that it was even a musical. Watching it now, it really carries a kind of cult status, particularly with the dialogue. More noteworthy is the look. The DP, Robert Surtees, obviously had to adhere to the technology of the times (probably through producer Ross Hunter's creed) that everything needs to be sharp and well lit for future television broadcasts. This was standard practice and you can see it here. In fact taking in the plot summary, it kind of reminds me of an episode of Star Trek, with Shang-ri-la  subbing for some distant planet. Then there's the musical numbers which really make the picture. The first one doesn't up until 41 minutes into the film and then things become quite entertaining. There's a duet with Peter Finch and Liv Ullman in which neither one lip syncs, obviously they're singing to each other telepathically. But I think Bobby Van is the biggest surprise. He's a really good song & dance man and he shines in the 'Question Me an Answer' number. The copy I received is a true 16:9 widescreen with a digital stereo soundtrack, although it's formatted on a DVD-R disc. No complaints, thoroughly enjoyed it.",1341792000,,1644,4.788732394366197
4718831,4,B005KR6O1C,"This reviewer was in the US Army and out of the USA for most of 1973 so did not know this (1973) remake of 'Lost Horizon' existed until recently. When I was very young (1960s) I saw a rendition of the 1937 'Lost Horizon' and liked the flick, whether or not I picked up on any message contained in the story. A few years ago I purchased the 1937 version on DVD and due to continued interest, found out about this semi-musical version and bought it. I felt that, with the exception of Olivia Hussey, the acting was rather 'flat', and left me feeling that this was something these actors did between 'important' jobs. I did appreciate the little ways that this version filled in bits of the story that the 1937 version did not (I have not read the 1933 novel).  Also, the music is very 'catchy' and supports the original theme of the novel well. I  make reference to this as a semi-musical because Ross Hunter describes this as ""not really a musical"", and perhaps this is something of a weakness, that it did not employ singers that could take this to the stage and was not intended as a 'real' musical and turned out to be a sort of hybrid movie production, not well received.  I look forward to watching and listening to this DVD again, the only problem for me will be constantly asking myself why on earth some of these actors were chosen for this project (even though this was an A list for that time). OK, sometimes little things get on your nerves, like two 'brothers', one with no noticeable English accent (Finch) and one with a heavy English accent (York), it just doesn't carry the part(s) and draw me into the fantasy of the story as a good production should. There are other elements such as Kellerman's aborted 'suicide' attempt that fail to 'pull me in'.  I rate this highly, however, because the uplifting message, through music, dialog, and costume is carried well and there are many of us who recall the thought of the time, that if we can just get one more war behind us, there is so much promise in the world, surly we can do better.  Sometimes, however, the only (apparent) sanity, or hope, we can find is in our own mind, and as it was stated at the end of the 1937 version, ""I believe in Shangri La because I have to believe"".",1341705600,2,2245,4.4

The film has been remastered to pristine quality and with added bonus materials and good to see the deleted scenes. I did watched the film when it was released in 1973 and was quite enchanted about it, as I was only 7 years old at the cinema, and I was simply adored the songs that we had on the soundtrack record.

The theme of the film is to live in moderation and how true especially in the present economic climate. Being greedy holds no boundary as it only produces grief and despair.

When it was first released, it was a flop financially and critics reallt panned the film and never did get it's credibility, however it did gained a cult status among fans of the film and it remain a favourite of mine. Best musical numbers are 'The World Is A Circle', 'Question Me An Answer' and 'Living Together, Growing Together'.

4718836,5,B005KR6O1C,"Ross Hunter and his team of artisans concocted quite an elaborate mess in 1973.  From the script - by a young Larry Kramer! - to the direction, the choreography, the casting, the costuming, the cinematography, the matte paintings, the scenery, and yes, even the hummable Bacharach-David score - virtually every aspect of this mammoth production is remarkably, epically wrong.  It defies imagination to consider HOW it ever got made.  But - to our current delight, and as an ardent fan of the movie upon its 1973 release - here it is, in technicolor splendor and with quite a lovely print (maybe even better than the one seen in the movies).  All of the rare treats - unseen for decades - including the Fertility Dance, the lengthened musical numbers (Peter Finch's soliloquy, a lovely tune mangled by a dubbed voice and lack of emotion) - everything is back in.  Settle in with friends or loved ones, and pop this baby in.  You are in for a (long) treat - so stock up on your favorite snacks and beverages.  And careful not to nod off before we reach Shangri-La (40 minutes in), or before the library number with Sally Kellerman and a visibly pregnant Olivia Hussey (wherein the shocking Hermes Pan ""choreography"" has these two non-musical talents splayed on tables and climbing ladders in an ersatz Fred and Ginger routine that will leave you both howling and gasping by the time it ends) - and most importantly, get to some of the extras.  Ross Hunter's maniacal defense of the film in a bizarre promo reel is nearly as fun as the movie itself. They don't make 'em like they used to! I've watched this 4 times since I purchased it, each time with a new group of friends new to the experience - I am hoarse from laughter, and find myself singing ""The World Is A Circle"" ...all the time.",1335225600,8,1787,4.59748427672956

The days of the great musicals was past and critics didn't like the idea of taking the great James Hilton and putting music to it. Burt Bacharach and Hal David did an outstanding job and the film was fun and entertaining.

We should enjoy a movie and many of the songs were great. Close inspection of some of the dance numbers revealed a lot of non-asians and I think that runs counter to what ""Shangri La"" was supposed to be.  The cast was first rate and I think you will enjoy Lost Horizon!!",1335139200,3,571,4.317757009345795

Love that few songs by Burt Bacharach, though at time sounded a little out of place! I almost lost all hope and I'm glad that SONY made it available on-demand DVD!

Recorded on DVD-R, it's nice that SONY offer the movie in 2.40 anamorphic widescreen and 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. Image is a little soft but good enough for DVD standard. Sound field mostly centre but open up during the musical numbers, which is good! It even include a few extra, which is nice as compare to Warner Archive Collection, which are all bare bone disc!

4718840,4,B005KR6O1C,"Sorry, couldn't resist since the only other thing I have seen Peter Finch in is his role for the ages: Howard Beal from Network.

I became aware of Lost Horizon from Michael Medved's Golden Turkey Awards

When I first read the book in the 80's, most of the bad movies mentioned took on sort of a mythical quality because home video hadn't progressed enough to put these oddities out and they were infrequently run on TV. The result was grinning in anticipation when something like Plan 9 From Outer Space would finally be shown on TV.

But crack open a Golden Turkey Awards Today and most of the movies mentioned are only a Netflix away. But Lost Horizon was a notable exception and still carried that mythical ""bad movie holy grail"" vibe for me.

Aside from a couple network showings and a laserdisc release, Lost Horizon has pretty much been kept under wraps. I did get a DVD dupe from a laserdisc but I have a tough time watching 4:3 widescreen on an HDTV so I never really watched it.

but I found that recently Lost Horizon was recently made available as a manufacture on demand title from Sony home video. Brand new 16:9 transfer and even some extras.

Time has proven that Golden Turkey Awards and the like was not above a little hyperbole when it came to how inept and bad a movie was so I was wondering how much it would live up to not only the GTA but the ubiquitous critical piling on it got from critics in 1973.

The answer is... it's not too good, some of the music numbers and choreography can be awkward and clunky but there is still some fun to be had in watching it. Perhaps it's the context. I got the DVD and watched it at my leisure after having it said over and over again the movie was monumentally awful and came out saying ""it wasn't as bad as all that"". In 1973, Lost Horizon was sold as a heir to musical such as The Sound Of Music and West Side Story. I heard the hype and promotion was intense. The producer, Ross Hunter, was known for extravagant crowd pleasing movies that were sometimes frowned upon by critics in the first place. So, under those circumstances, it was begging to be roasted. Also they may of thought like I did, that there was a greater movie in there somewhere and better music too (The World Is A Circle is probably the best of the music).

So, for fellow fans of big budget misfires, you can't go wrong. From the nicely done 16:9 transfer to the extras to the fact that until recently it's been hard to find, it could be your own little piece of Shangri-La.

Now if only Jerry Lewis would stop sitting on ""The Clown That Cried"" or they would finally release ""Matilda"" (no, not that one, this one is from 1978 and is about a boxing Kangaroo)that would be the next ""what a rush!"" moment for submerged bad movie fans.",1333497600,,2766,4.365758754863813

4718847,4,B005KR6O1C,"I hate to start a movie review off with the things the film did wrong, so I'll start with the positive.

I have the 1937 version of Lost Horizon, and in terms of the script this 1973 version is very similar.  Both are true to the spirit of the original James Hilton novel, which I've read several times.  This film was also cast very well.  In particular, the characters of Richard Conway and Sally Hughes, played by Peter Finch and Sally Kellerman respectively, were outstanding.  To my mind, Charles Boyer was absolutely the best pick for the High Lama (Father Perrault) to be found.  Sam Jaffe played that role in the 1937 original film, and set the bar high for interpreting how a 200+ year old European man living all that time amongst Tibetans in a lamisary would act and sound.  Boyer's performance was more than up to the task.

The cinematography was also excellent.  Rather than opting to recreate a mountain pass with props on a sound stage, the crew filmed on Mt. Hood in Oregon in 30 degree below zero weather, and the realism in the cinematography is evident.  The sets depicting the lamisary were also excellent.

If I could stop there, with the script, the casting, and the cinematography, this film would have been a 5+ star film.  Alas, there was one element so poorly done, and so intrusive into the rest of the film that it drags the whole of it down to about 3.5 or 4 stars.  The Achilles heel of Lost Horizon is a truly wretched musical score, co-written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David.  It's difficult to know where to begin listing all the ways the music went wrong.

I'll mention the thing that stuck out to me most, and that is, the music was completely incongruent with the subject and setting of the film.  This is a film set in Tibet, in the Himalayas, largely in a monastic community.  The subject and setting of this film absolutely demand at minimum a fleeting glimpse of asian flavor to the songs.  There was not the slightest hint of anything reflective of the culture or setting of the movie.  It's like Enya releasing an album called ""Celtic Hits"", and having nothing on the album but rap music.  If you're going to call something a duck, then it better walk and talk like a duck and not a turkey.

Burt Bacharach songs all sound like...well, Burt Bacharach songs.  They are virtually all done in the same style in which he wrote ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head.""  He made no attempt at all to capture the flavor of the Tibetan setting, or of the asian culture that would literally permeate a lamisary.  Instead, every piece in this movie was written as though for The Sound of Music, or Annie, or The Music Man.  There simply aren't any words to adequately convey how incongruent the music was with the content of the movie.  The best I can do is suggest an analogy.  Suppose that in the movie Braveheart, every time a song came on it was played by a Mexican Mariachi band.  No haunting Celtic tunes, no mournful bagpipes, just blaring Mariachi trumpets and guitars.  That's the sort of jarring, off-putting effect the awful music composed for Lost Horizon has.  It is pickle relish and mustard as toppings on a banana split.  As that old Sesame Street song used to say, ""One of these things just doesn't belong here...""

Beyond the music itself, the lyrics were atrocious.  They were in-your-face-preachy.  As my old writing professors used to say, ""Show details, don't tell about them.""  The lyrics to the musical pieces in Lost Horizon were awful, awful, awful!  They were used as a substitute for more movie dialogue.  But, if those same words had been written in as dialogue proper (which is what they actually were,) any kindergarten editor would have chopped them out in abject horror.  They violate every rule about using dialogue when telling a story.  And, as with the music itself, their tone and flavor is completely at odds with the characters in the movie.  These are not the words or ideas you would hear expressed if you were in Tibet, in an isolated mountain community hidden in the Himalayas.  They are fingernails down a chalkboard.

Last of all, the dance numbers.  What can I say?  I have seen classical dance from many different eastern cultures, from Malaysia to Cambodia.  I even took a few lessons in Thai classical dance.  Though each is unique, they are all quite clearly related.  The movements of the hands, arms, heads, legs, and feet, share many common elements from culture to culture in the east.  They are beautiful and distinct from any western style of dance.  The choreographer in Lost Horizon should be horse whipped for the butchery committed here.  This was all Broadway/American-style dancing.  There was clearly not the slightest inkling of how dance in Tibet is performed, and just as clearly, the choreographer didn't care to make any effort to find out.  In the wildest dance scene of all, the dancing was a mixture of ballet leaps, a few jazz steps thrown in, and some bits that looks like they were ripped straight out of some old Tarzan movies where the natives were doing war dances before going on the attack.  What total hubris, to make a movie in which Tibetans dance, and yet there is nothing of Tibetan culture whatsoever in the dances.  Might as well have just brought in those Mariachis to play all the dance music because it wouldn't have made it any worse.

What makes the horrible music situation complete is the frequency of the musical numbers.  There were I think about 10 singing numbers, and several dance pieces.  All in all, you had to endure some sort of musical bomb on average about every 10 minutes or so.  Each time one of them reared its ugly head, the wife and I just looked at each other and groaned.  I forced myself to watch them all during the first viewing.  In future viewings I will fast forward through them.  I may even rip the film, edit them out, and reburn the movie to DVD so I can watch without all the interruption.

I still recommend Lost Horizon, though the music does dull that recommendation somewhat.  If the same movie were to be released, minus all the bad and unnecessary music, I'd give it 5+ stars.",1328572800,,6137,4.61460258780037

When I grew up, I commenced my search to get this movie.  It was frustrating to learn that it was virtually impossible to get it.  After almost 25 years of searching, I finally got the chance to buy it through Amazon. Still, even after ordering it, I was not so optimistic about getting the movie.

However, almost a week after ordering it I received the DVD at my office. I immediately left my office and went home to watch the movie.  What a thrill!! The quality of the video is unbelievable. The sound was also great.  It was even better than when I first saw it.  For me, it was a breathless experience.

And what about the music?  Nobody is better than the genius, Burt Bacharach.  The music score is great.  Forget about the critics that expected Peter Finch and Liv Ullman to sing like Pavarotti and Renee Fleming.  If they wanted to hear an opera, go get an opera.  For me it is all about the interpretation, the message and the story.  They where all great.  Also, what about Bobby Van. This guy was fun.

The cinematography is great, especially in the mountain scenery - the acting is very good - a great ensemble of actors work together admirably, and the story has always been intriguing. Should it have been made into a musical? Probably not, but there is some good music to be heard - maybe one just needs to believe that in Shangri-La things aren't like in the outside world. So for me this film is a guilty pleasure - and I'll watch it again and again over the years. The quality of the DVD is very good and the extras are fine - would have enjoyed more. The extra of Burt Bacharach singing his songs is very interesting even though he can't really sing well - makes one want to hear some of the songs sung by other artists. I had been waiting for the DVD to come out - and when it did - bought it immediately. So be prepared to suspend disbelief like never before!

4718863,2,B005KR6O1C,"LOST HORIZON opened in early 1973, and most engagements were of the heavily edited version resulting from cuts the version that premiered to silence, and worse, guffaws. It's a terrible movie, no question, that I've seen about a dozen times over the past 40 years. The Laserdisc version had some of the cut material reinstated. It didn't make any difference whatsover to the quality of the film. And now, this DVD of what can be assumed to be the original cut. Beautifully imaged, by the way, by Columbia Home Video. This is the most complete cut I've seen certainly, and, again, the new material doesn't help the film at all. It just makes an already oddly slow-moving musical even longer. With restored musical numbers assuring us that, yes, the film IS spectacularly embarrassing. LOST HORIZON was to be a 70mm blow-up/stereo event film opening on a platform release basis.  Lots of publicity before the first openings, even a souvenir program book for sale in the lobby (along with the soundtrack album). The film was not a roadshow, although it has been called that, erroneously. No reserved seats or intermission. But a big-deal movie is not what happened. A big bomb of a movie, yes.

So now we have the whole thing, ""Fertility Dance"" and all. And by the way, the ""Fertility Dance"" (with a pregnant Oliva Hussey being tossed about by badly-wigged chorus boys) is way beyond embarrassing. One of the reasons that the movie musical was quickly dying was this film; blame must be cast. It ruined producer Ross Hunter in Hollywood, it ended choreographer Hermes Pan's illustrious career, the composing team of Burt Bachrach-Hal David had broken up before the release, no one benefited from being associated with this disaster.

As a record of a terrible time for the movie musical, LOST HORIZON more than qualifies. The DVD is a well put-together package, sound (after exchanging disc for full stereo version) is terrific. Those dreadful songs can be heard in amazing detail. Thank you, Columbia Classics, for making my DVD collection of terrible movie musicals more complete!",1326412800,6,2079,4.951289398280802

So if this was such a a piece of trash why would I buy it and watch it again? I guess you could say sometimes it sparks a interest to see if you would feel the same way 40 years later. I must say it was not as bad as I remembered. Is it a good film? Well no. But it is sort of a camp classic to sit and watch while having a few drinks or a glass of wine.

4718874,4,B005KR6O1C,"For those concerned about the dvd mix being in mono, here's a quote (and link) from an interview with Grover Crisp, Executive VP of Asset Management, Film Restoration & Digital Mastering at Sony Pictures.

Q - The new DVD was released mono, but the press release indicated a new 5.1.  What happened?

A - Quite frankly, I still don't know how it happened, except that somewhere in the manufacturing chain there was a mix-up and the wrong audio file was encoded.  An honest mistake, but one that is obviously embarrassing and for which we apologize.  The problem has been rectified now and as of last week all new discs manufactured have the correct 5.1 and anyone who wants a replacement can exchange it at the point of sale.  All sellers should be aware of this.

Hope this helps.

4718875,5,B005KR6O1C,"Having seen this in the cinema on original release I was always surprised why it was panned and then mutilated for later releases.  Even recently there was a showing on UK TV but it was the edited version and was completely ruined.  Even Bobby Van`s quirky `Question me an answer`song was cut. Bobby  sadly died in 1980 and it is fantastic to have the restored full version. I would have liked a Blu Ray but having said that the transfer is stunning and really looked superb played on a Blu Ray upscaler on a HD projector on the big screen. Projection always shows any transfer defects or lower quality but it was just beautiful.

My recommendation buy it whilst it is available and before it becomes `Lost` Horizon once more.",1320796800,4,726,4.561538461538461
4718876,5,B005KR6O1C,"Much has been written about the musical drama of LOST HORIZON from 1973, so I'll concentrate on this DVD release from Sony/Columbia. I've been a fan of this film for many years since first viewing it on network television, and I'm not going to delve into the critical aspects of the film.  I like it and am not persuaded by others' criticisms of it.  Call it a guilty pleasure if you must.

I first learned of this title's availability just a few weeks ago as a fellow Bacharach fan mentioned it on a forum I frequent.  Eagerly I ordered the disc from Amazon, and quickly received it.  A number of online reviews were mentioning that though a press release promised a 5.1 surround soundtrack, the ones they received were 2.0 mono.  That was also my experience.  Nevertheless I sat back to enjoy the film anyway.  I have the old LaserDisc version, so I was making comparisons between the two.

The picture quality on the DVD was far superior to the LaserDisc, but the sound was mildly disappointing, given that I'd heard it in stereo for all of the intervening years since the LaserDisc was released.  Still, I enjoyed the experience.  The restoration of the film elements to create a new longer version than had ever been released before was exciting.  New sections in the film include a different take for ""I Come To You"" and the long-lost Fertility Dance sequence, and all restored elements look gorgeous, just like the main body of the wide-released film itself.  The LaserDisc restoration of some of these songs was a welcome feature years ago, but the graininess and faded color of those sequences on the LaserDisc always managed to take you out of the movie.  So this DVD was close to perfect - if only the soundtrack were in stereo...

A post on the Home Theater Forum revealed that in fact the disc's creators had fully intended a new Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track, but that an error in the manufacturing of the MOD discs resulted in the wrong track - a mono one - being used instead.  And this gentleman from Sony Pictures promised that the error had been fixed and that everyone should return their discs to their retailers for an exchange with a disc with the proper soundtrack.

I did just that.  I contacted Amazon.com, and their gracious customer representative took the time to iron out the problem and engineer an exchange - and within 24 hours, I now have the corrected disc with the proper surround soundtrack.

Kudos to Sony Pictures for doing right by this film and correct their original mistake - to the Home Theater Forum for ferreting out the correct information from the proper source - and to Amazon.com for standing by their promise of customer satisfaction.  Well done, all.",1320710400,15,2705,4.678646934460888
4718877,4,B005KR6O1C,"By 1973, the movie musical format had just about been killed by  a series of bad films and box office flops. This movie, obviously commissioned when the world was still in loved with ""the Sound of Music"" and everyone rushed to make copies of the style and type of family musical , hit a wall on its release  and never fully recovered. It came too late and the times had changed, no one wanted to know about Shangri La and Burt Bacharach's not always appropriate music score. Yet the film has a charm and as someone else has said here, takes one back to a happier time,like many who have written here, I have a very happy memory of seeing the film with my mother when we were stuck in Adelaide having missed a bus holiday. Everything seemed to work fine once we saw this film. (is that corney or what!!) Not without its faults for sure, outrageously camp at times (especially the fertility dance)it is great to see the movie in its entirety for the very first time complete with Peter Finch's powerful musical monologue. How amazing it has been restored and released on DVD. It is very welcome. As a sub  note, I would add, I have always found the oirginal movie so adored by critics, to be unwatchable. It is so dated and twee and heavy handed. Much prefer this one.",1320364800,3,1266,4.401709401709402
4718878,5,B005KR6O1C,"Let's face it, this Shangri-La is a BURT BACHARACH Shangri-La and with this film FINALLY released in it's original release cut, the effect is nothing short of wonderful.  The clean tones, bright colors and crystal clear image  bring to attention the detail and beauty of the production design.  Songs like IF I COULD GO BACK and WHERE KNOWLEDGE ENDS, FAITH BEGINS deepen the meaning of the characters.  The freshness of the lovers song I COME TO YOU is as romantic as ever.  Liv Ullmann is the ultimate princess in paradise.  The much criticized (at the time) Fertility dance is striking.  In 1973 there was no Cirque Du Soleil, which this number definitely resembles.  The dancing is a little startling at first, but builds to a point of being absolutely mesmerizing.  They should have had faith in it despite the laughs.  It's a highlight of this DVD.

LOST HORIZON is a strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the ONLY anti war musical fantasy ever made, where as the story takes place in another land.

What you don't hear about this film is that it made a lot of money overseas. Highly different and unique in it's approach as a film musical, it deserves far better credit than it's given. As a story, LOST HORIZON is an incredible adventure and both the 1937 Frank Capra film and this 1973 musical are faithful adaptations of the James Hilton novel. What I like about the 1973 version is the freedom in which the musical numbers are presented. The film has a prestigious cast and a gifted director, production designer and cinematographer. This is a BURT BACHARACH Shangri-La. Songs like THE WORLD IS A CIRCLE, SHARE THE JOY and LIVING TOGETHER, GROWING TOGETHER evoke a giddy happiness that Hilton wrote about in his novel. Why shouldn't Shangri-La be a slightly goofy place? The two love songs, I MIGHT FRIGHTEN HER AWAY and the deleted I COME TO YOU are the sensitive spots in the picture. There's a peaceful and soft spoken quality in Charles Jarrott's direction that is very much in keeping with the philosophy of the story.

I always found it interesting how the High Lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in Shangri-La. The character of the High Lama is a gentle soul but somewhat radical in his view of mankind as a whole. He has no hope for the world outside of Shangri-La. If this film were to be remade today, it would be interesting to see more emphasis put on the leading character, RICHARD CONWAY'S conflict with what he left behind in the outside world as opposed to what he's found in Shangri-La.  In this version the principals all have the right amount of sadness needed for the story,  but it's Liv Ullmanns mysteriousness and the transformation of Sally Kellerman's character that makes you believe a place like Shangri-La could exist.

Of course, for the film to be believable, the character of RICHARD CONWAY must be presented as suffering amnesia at the end, like he was in the book. Neither film versions of LOST HORIZON were faithful to the novel in that regard. Did Conway find Shangri-La or was it imagined? Did they all die in the plane crash? Every man has his own idea of what his Shangri-La would be. The conflict with Conway wanting to believe in Shangri-La and returning to his old life in the outside world is powerful. I like the melancholy on the faces of Kellerman, Kennedy and Van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley. Interesting how Conway doesn't want to leave paradise, but is being pressured out by his brother. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways, but both are successful in probing James Hiltons ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule. So in a sense it's anti capitalism in it's theme where as money and materialism is not the motivation. Human kindness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and living harmoniously with each other is the rule.

LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musicals. It attempts to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly fault it for not succeeding. One has to remember that LOST HORIZON in 1973 was post CABARET. It was no longer fashionable for characters to break out into song in a musical, much less to be dubbed by other singers. LOST HORIZON was an easy target for tough cynical critics. The expectations for it were high, almost unreasonable. There were two targets to be hit, the producer, ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH and the critics were out to get both of them. Ross Hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and LOST HORIZON was his follow up film to his 1970 blockbuster AIRPORT That film was Universals biggest moneymaker up to that time and the success of that picture triggered a decade of disaster films.  It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture.  At the time, Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the most successful songwriters in the country. The unabashed sentimentality of LOST HORIZON hardly had a chance in the wake of the breakdown of censorship in groundbreaking films like EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and THE GODFATHER.  Sex and violence was a new frontier in the late 60's and early 70's.  Audiences were flocking to films with content that they were not use to seeing on the screen.  Lavish musicals were no longer well received no matter how well they were made.  Today LOST HORIZON can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels. It's an escapist film with a strong story, wonderful music, an expensive budget and some quirky humor.  Why shouldn't paradise be a slightly goofy place?  It's unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced until 45 minutes into the film. It changes course mid way when Shangri-la is introduced. This was hard for alot of viewers to accept back in 1973.  Never been a problem for me.",1319587200,12,5878,4.743866535819431
4718879,5,B005KR6O1C,"This review is for the 2011 Warner Bros On Demand DVD - it is the complete version of this film as far as i can tell, and contains the infamous lost fertility dance! The picture quality is consistent all the way through, as is the sound quality. Very nice all around. The orginal laserdisc had some of scenes restored, but the quality was not the best as it was from found remnants.

Somehow I think they had the original negative or a good print of the roadshow in the vault all along.  They even included a cache of pictures, demo version of the songs sung by Burt Bacharach, and even a few of the era documentaries.  This is one of the best warner on demand disks i have seen!",1318809600,4,679,4.248062015503876
4718880,4,B005KR6O1C,"Much has been said about the film already, so I will limit my thoughts to the DVD itself, which is a real treat.

SPECIAL FEATURES (as written on the packaging):

Original Song Demos by Burt Bacharach (with photo gallery)
Ross Hunter Short - a 36-minute film
Original Trailers and TV Spots
Ross Hunter on the way to Shangri-La - 10-minute featurette
Alternate Scene - ""I Come To You.""

The language is listed as English, Dolby Digital. No mention of a new 5.1 mix anywhere, so this was likely a mistake in the press release, sadly. The audio is actually 2.0 Mono, 48 khz, 192 kbps. Video is 2.40:1 Anamorphic Widescreen. Running time is listed as ""approx."" 149 minutes. Region 1.

Starting with the audio, even if it's not a new 5.1 mix, as an advance Sony press release (and subsequently many websites) indicated, it's a wonderfully robust mono soundtrack, fully restored. Crystal-clear high frequencies and rich full bass sounds. As for the video, the movie looks fantastic. It's 2.40:1 Anamorphic widescreen. Colors are saturated, skin tones are natural, and detail is incredible. I noticed things I'd never seen before in the set decoration, the costume fabrics, etc. The vibrant green for the interior of the airplane hull, the crimson of the monks' robes, the eye-popping hues of the flowers during ""The World Is a Circle."" Detail holds up really well in the shadows, too, during the darker scenes. Noise is kept to a minimum, but I see no obvious use of noise-reduction. This is just an incredibly good remastering job. Short of having the disc in HD, I don't think it could look any better. I'm thrilled that all of the cut footage has quite obviously been restored from the original negative as well, so there's no ""jump"" in quality between the wide release footage and the restored scenes, as there was with the Pioneer laser disc release in the '90s. It all looks and sounds equally great here.

A quick rundown of the extras:

The TV spots aren't restored, but look and sound fine. The Teaser and Theatrical Trailer are fully restored. I loved the full theatrical trailer, which is in widescreen and narrated on-screen by Ross Hunter! There is a ""wavering hum"" present in the audio of the full trailer, but it isn't too distracting.

The Bacharach demos: I noticed different lyrics on ""Question Me An Answer,"" references to Greta Garbo and Don Ameche, etc. The video is an animated presentation of static photos sliding by the screen on a moving ""film strip"" background. Some GREAT behind-the-scenes shots, literally hundreds altogether that, after a while, repeat throughout the demos. There are QUITE a few song demos, too, almost the entire score, and all seem to be complete versions of the songs with Burt singing (and croaking a bit) and playing piano beautifully. The sound quality of these mono demos is excellent.

The 10-minute Ross Hunter short film is in widescreen as well. It's in very good shape, although it's not color-corrected, so it has a faded, vintage look (which I like). Ross shares some great behind-the-scenes info about making the film, too. On the packaging and in the advance press release, this is listed as a 36-minute Promo film, but because the clips from the actual movie have been excised, it really clocks in around ten minutes in length. I didn't miss seeing an extra 26 minutes of the movie again, especially right after watching it. I was more interested in what Mr. Hunter had to say about making the movie. So the leaner running time wasn't an issue with me ... although they should probably correct it on the packaging.

The 10-minute ""Ross Hunter on the Way To Shangri-La"" vintage featurette is excellent, with great behind-the-scenes footage and narrative. I'm so glad they included this on the DVD! It's a 4x3 presentation, not restored, but in fine shape regardless.

Lastly, the ""alternate version"" of ""I Come To You"" is taken from the Pioneer laser disc, with different staging than seen during the film on the DVD. It's not restored visually (if you remember the laser disc look), but the song is in stereo, since the producer of the laser disc did his own stereo mix of the film.

And one last note that has caused some minor confusion among the hardcore fans of the film: With the inclusion of previously cut scenes, the publicity release and packaging mention a never-before-seen reprise of ""Living Together, Growing Together."" After the Fertility Dance (which has not been seen in a home video release until this DVD and is quite exciting and wonderful), there is a very short reprise of the song ""Living Together, Growing Together,"" which ends the ""ceremonial"" scene. However, there was also a (second) reprise of this song later in the film, sung by Sally Kellerman and George Kennedy while they are working on the new irrigation system. That reprise is still sadly missing. But the packaging notes are correct in saying a reprise of the song is included ""for the first time"" on this DVD.

Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has done themselves proud with this release. It comes as somewhat of a surprise to me, since almost all of the MOD (manufactured on demand) DVDs from Sony, Warner Archives, and MGM have been ""bare bones"" discs. Most haven't even been restored. With ""Lost Horizon,"" they have treated it as a first-cleass ""Special Edition"" project, and fans of this film shouldn't hesitate for one second about buying it.

UPDATE: (November 14, 2011) The issue with the audio has been fixed! I received a replacement disc from Amazon today and tested it on my home theatre sound system. It's a fully-designed 5.1 audio mix. What a world of difference! It's now equally as impressive as the restored image. This is not just a stereo mix of the music fed to the back speakers. Sound effects, crowd noises, ambient sounds, etc., all fully designed in the discrete 5.1 channels. I'm so happy Sony fixed the problem and Amazon was quick to replace my disc. I would say, based on my experience that the problem is now solved, and I wouldn't hesitate to either order a copy or have your mono disc (if you received one) replaced. It was definitely worth the trouble!",1318723200,100,6130,4.815589353612167
4718881,4,B005KR6O1C,"At long last, this much-maligned musical-drama makes its way to DVD.  I was surprised the care Sony took with this one as well, considering its small audience.  The film has been mastered in it's original 16:9 2.4:1 ratio from a very clean print. They've even found some of the cut sequences such as the ""fertility dance"" and added in some extras as well. These sequences are of the same visual quality as the film itself and the transitions aren't jarring as they were on the laserdisc of many years ago.
As for the film, well, it's as good and as bad as they say. The music is catchy even if the lyrics are pretty clunky, and the performances of them are sometimes limp. The worst offenders for me was the chreography by Hermes Pan which seems amateurish, and the direction which was very heavy-handed. Despite this, it's still quite entertaining and the ""message"" is still relevant today.",1318723200,6,891,4.6687898089171975

The quality of the picture if at if not above that generaly from DVD, the sound is electronic stereo from mono master which is good and very clean. It is claimed segments removed after release have been returned, there is no lack of quality to indicate this and I cannot remember the film frame by frame vbut it is the longer length listed on IMDB.

4718893,5,B005KR6O1C,"I have been waiting for almost the entire 38 years since Lost Horizon hit the big screen in 1973 for a high quality, complete copy of this musical on either DVD, Laserdisc, or originally VHS; thanks to the fellow film buffs and historians at Columbia Classics, we finally have it.

Although as a film buff and collector, I am very tempted to write a glowing review of the musical remake of Lost Horizon, if only to offer an alternate view to the conventional idea by critics that this film was so bad, I will not do that. If you have found your way to this listing, you no doubt already are familiar with this movie musical version, and probably, like I, have seen it either on the silver screen in 1973, or on the rare showing on cable television. Suffice it to say, I liked this musical very much, enjoyed the Burt Bacharach /Hal David music , for the most part, respected and agreed with the film's political stance which was decidedly pro-peace and anti war as Vietnam drew to a close, and enjoyed the varied and all star cast, most of whom had no musical experience. Most of all, this 1973 film takes me back to a good place and time in my life, so for me it was an important film memory.

I do want to give great credit to Columbia Pictures Classics, and to the executives and technicians at Columbia who stuck with this film restoration process, which was not easy. This 2011 version is presented in glorious 2:40:1 Panavision anamorphic widescreen format, with colors literally jumping off the screen. The digital artifacts of even the many ""lost sections"" have been artfully removed, and the overall film has as beautiful a rendering as you could expect on the DVD format. Only a blu-ray, which is unlikely, would be marginally better. Missing film segments, including several musical numbers, were fully restored, and in addition to the picture being digitally remastered by the latest techniques, the sound is remastered in clean Dolby Digital stereo. All 149 minutes of the original feature are present, as are a 36 minute film short from producer Ross Hunter, and other extras not seen previously. As a film buff, a film collector, and in particular an admirer
of the American musical format, I appreciate both the good and less than good qualities of the sometime corny film, and uneven quality of the songs, many of which were dubbed. This film is a good representation of the product of Hollywood of the early 1970's in so many ways; in a sense it is a time capsule. The film compares favorably with other great musicals of the period, like Cabaret or Hello Dolly. It is far from the worst musical ever made (Maybe Paint Your Wagon deserves that honor!)

After buying several bootlegged unofficial versions of Lost Horizon 1973 from various sites, it is a real joy to have this DVD version added to the collection.

The DVD-R lacks nothing in quality when compared to any major studio release, and should play well on any newer DVR. So enthusiastically, I bought two copies, to have a back up.

I can absolutely recommend this DVD to anyone who loves musicals or appreciates films of the 1970's, not exactly America's best film decade.

4718894,4,B005KR6O1C,"This is a review of the film and not this DVD release.  This musical was restored with missing scenes on laser disc some time ago.

My heart, too, was touched by the ""message"" of this movie musical.  I was so glad they restored missing scenes (picked right up off the cutting room floor with dirt, scratches, and all) and I'm so glad to see it finally reach DVD release.  I do know that the film was ""scope"" and am wondering if it is a mistake to list its aspect ratio as 1.33 to 1 by Amazon.  Surely they would not do this to a film that has been such a long time coming to DVD format.  But they did it to ""Annie"" so you never know.

And everyone knows it was a big flop in 1973, when critics panned it and audiences stayed away in droves. But something interesting has happened to it in the nearly 40 years since its first release. Now that Broadway and Hollywood musicals have become a lost art, it looks a lot better than it did then.

I saw it in a theater in '73 (I was 18). I'd read the book and seen the old Ronald Colman movie, both of which I loved, but I liked this version well enough to buy the soundtrack album and hum along with the catchy tunes. And the girl I took to see it really loved it--she'd never read the book or seen the old movie, so she was getting the story for the first time.

Five jaded, disillusioned Westerners (British and American) escape a revolution in a South Asian country on the last plane out, only to be ""shanghaied"" to Shangri-la, a mysterious lamasery hidden in a sunny valley in the frozen mountains of Tibet. What they find there will change their lives--and ours.

In this expensive musical version, the dramatic story is interrupted from time to time for some Burt Bacharach/Hal David songs and a couple of big production numbers. The all-star cast apparently had fun making the film, even if most of their singing was dubbed by professionals. Sally Kellerman (MASH), James Shigeta (FLOWER DRUM SONG), and Broadway hoofer Bobby Van (NO, NO, NANETTE) are the only stars actually singing. Watching the new Columbia DVD-R after all these years, I was surprised by one credit--the screenplay was by Larry Kramer, the celebrated playwright (THE NORMAL HEART) and AIDS activist. The uninspired direction of Charles Jarrott (ANNE OF THE THOUSAND DAYS, THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT, etc.) is the film's biggest weakness. But the main points of Hilton's timeless story are there, and the score is pleasant.

No, this isn't a great film musical, but it really doesn't deserve its bad reputation. It's actually rather charming. Try it.",1318550400,11,2394,5.35904255319149
4718896,5,B005KR6O1C,"Already I'm hoping for ""Blu Ray"" but even without it ""Sony/Columbia"" is to be congradulated
to RESTORING a version never seen of a very unpopular musical. I believe both the story
and ""some"" of the musical numbers makes more sense today and it belongs with ""HAIR"" as an
anti war musical. So this review is for the ""RESTORED VERSION"" JUST RELEASED.

Let go of your cynical views and look at the philosophy behind this film..a ""world not in
chaos,"" where ""we are responsible for INDIRECT suicide.""

I was taken away by the beauty of the story and the modern ""operetta"" score by ""Burt Bachrach""
and find nothing laughsble in the choreography of the complete ""Living Together, Growing Together."" This film is a 70's liberal dream. This is a film that hits the ""heart"" if you
let go and allow a very different musical than ever made. I can't think of a film without
flaws or suggestions. But having this film ""torn apart"" seems childish as you will feel
when the film ends. The story is eternal.

Yes, it doesn't all work. The direction is heavy handed and nothing special but I feel the passion ""Ross Hunter"" had in making this remake of a film that was NOT a hit when first released. ""Peter Finch,"" ""Liv Ullmann,"" ""John Geilgud,"" and ""Charles Boyer"" are excellent.
And you find yourself involved with both the story and the philosophy. The weakest aspect
of the film are the ""costumes designed by Jean Louis."" Very 70's! But based on this summer's
films I simply loved it!

I keep thinking this film is now 30 years old and either a remake or stage version could
bring the same effect as ""Les Miserables.""

If you are cynical, believe in war, poverty, the lack of care of human life then this is
not a film for you ....you must leave your cynical political views alone and watch a film
that is very political, but NOT the disaster claimed when first released.

This film touched my soul and for that reason alone, after past years of personal
tragedy and sadness, makes this a winning experience I look forward to share with others.

In this time of global war, where in Third World Countries women are treated as sub humans
and death is random this film gave me over 2 hours of beauty and reasons why I must believe
that one day our political system will not be corrupt. For my belief in ""President Obama""
was so high & has turned into another politician I need to believe there are reasons to
love this world we live in and this film thanks to ""SONY"" has allowed me to believe
in the future that the ""meek WILL inherit"" the earth. This is a passive musical that
came out during war time. But being in my 50's I simply can't remember a time when there
was no war!!

The earnestess of the film overrides cynicism. I only wish ""Ross Hunter"" was alive to see
his vision of the film intact.

Anyone who degrades this film as just pop philosophy is missing the point I believe
""Ross Hunter"" hoped for when making this film. The casting is off...not all the music and
musical numbers work but strangely the best numbers are the ones that have been restored
for they are more of a seriousness nature to them and propel the film forward while other
songs just take up time with no real reason.

The color and sound as a DVD R is quite beautiful. There is no reason anymore to buy
a ""pirated version.""

Give yourself in to the beauty of ""Shangri La"" and ""Lost Horizon."" And lastly, this is
simply excellent family entertainment. ""Sony"" gave this a five star treatment for a
film forgotten by most as well as put down for someone at ""Sony"" saw the ""beauty""
of this film which I strongly recommend. As a ""humanist,"" but also as a lover for
films this one will always remain special for it touches my heart.

The number one rule of reviewing is: Take it for what it is, not for what you wish it was!

I saw the movie in the theater and have never seen it since.  My father bought the soundtrack (I have no idea why. He never saw the movie) and I just about wore it out on my little, portable ""monophonic record player"", a cheap plastic thing I can't remember how I acquired.
I was just 13 and 14 around that time and was finding reasons to live hard to come by. No, this movie didn't save my life, but it pointed me in the right direction: faith, family, friends, community. And it warned me of the pitfalls: materialism, pride, arrogance, deception.

Heavy messages from a corny musical with clumsy lyrics and bad screenwriting, I know. But perhaps I should have said, take it for what it is for you; not for what you think it ought to be.

The fact is, the opening song spoke to my own despairing, angst-ridden teen-age heart. ""Have you ever dreamed of a place far away from it all where the air you breath is soft and clean and children play in fields of green? And the sound of guns doesn't sound in your ears anymore?  There's a lost horizon waiting to be found. There's a lost horizon where the sound of guns doesn't pound in your ears anymore.""

Also, each character is facing a life in the world that does not satisfy their heart.  Who can't relate to that? Sally Kellerman's character tries to kill herself! Bobby Van, a stereotypical unfunny comic discovers what he craves is not fame and fortune, but acceptance and loving recognition.  George Kennedy finds fulfillment not in unearned wealth but in using his best gifts to make life better for his community (I know, I know! It's ridiculous to think a place could be paradise with apparent slave labor drawing water for crops.  At least, that's what I thought I was seeing and figured the movie was going to take a cynical turn as we find out Shangri-la isn't a utopia after all, but more like a Greek nation-state with a slave class.  Instead, they just hadn't gotten around to inventing modern irrigation.  They must have been waiting for George Kennedy!)

And finally, Peter Finch, a few years before he melted down on national news television as Howard Beale, decides the world can go suck an egg, too!  He's got a utopia to lead.  Perhaps Howard Beale should have looked for Shangri-La.

It's sad if they never intend to release this on DVD.  I've never seen it on television either.

Come on! It wasn't that bad.  Hollywood has certainly released worse on the world. Who's holding up this release?  Get over yourself.  This movie deserves to be seen by everyone to whom it speaks.",1268524800,59,2666,4.5125
4718898,4,B005KR6O1C,I saw this movie when it first came out and immediately bought the soundtrack and memorized many of the songs.  I have lost the soundtrack and would love to get another copy on CD and would love to own the dvd of this if they ever make it.  Kids would love this movie and adults that will let themselves be kids will also love it.,1180396800,10,330,4.061538461538461
4718899,5,B005KR6O1C,"Forget the pompous critics that are so full of themselves that they can't let this movies tunes play with their heart cords, which is what it does best. This is a wonderfull movie with great uplifting messages and songs that I heard once in my teens and touched my life forever. Talks about the magic that pure and real feelings can bring out of one's heart!

I want the DVD, but can't seem to find.",1180224000,30,399,4.32
4718900,3,B005KR6O1C,"I read the reviews of this remake of the classic B/W film with Ronald Coleman and Jane Wyman ('Mrs. Anderson' from the 1950's TV-show, ""Father Knows Best""). Suffice it to say, when I was in HS (when this movie came out) I had a class. The object of this English class was to read a novel made into a movie, then go see the movie, and compare/contrast. With 'Deliverance' as my 'other' choice (I still get chills when I hear or think of that opening banjo motif!) this movie [LH73] AT THE VERY LEAST was a far 'nicer', more noble venture to watch for a HS English class.

BUT- Having said that, I think that the oldest review on this site has it clearly delineated. The Musical version of Lost Horizon is a COMPLETE BUST when you try to compare the classic B/W film, with the smarmy Bacharach score and cheesy acting of this 'newer version.' When I was 17 and a musical neophyte, I liked the score. At 50+, with a Doctorate in Music, I still 'like' the score, as a 'cute' musical divertissment, but NOT as the incarnation of Hilton's novel. I have seen many [all?] of Hilton's books made into films, and ALL OF THEM are excellent, top notch, and very well acted: 'Goodbye, Mr. Chips' (Robert Donat, Greer Garson); Lost Horizon (mentioned above) and Random Harvest (Coleman and Garson).

Even the 1968 remake of Hilton's ""Chips"" with Petula Clark and Peter O' Toole fares better than this '73 Lost Horizon. And I think the biggest obstacle to the whole thing is Bacharach's 'stuck-in-the-'60's' ""Do you know the way to San Jose"" score!! Bacharach, as a musician, NEVER could be 'serious' or 'unhappy' and that is both his greatest plus, and his biggest minus. IN ""LH"", you HAVE to have a sense of mystery, angst, agelessness, and love lost, or the whole thing goes down the tubes. And, sad to say, even though I like the songs, when you put them to the film, there is a disconnect that just makes it all so BAD!

Perhaps, this is just ONE of the reasons the film will NEVER be released on DVD. It is just too embarassing, and not even 'cult' status will rescue it from it's deserved obscurity.",1172793600,6,2091,4.482939632545932
4718901,5,B005KR6O1C,"My eight year old nephew loves the music from this film.  It has been fun introducing the next generation to some of things that we enjoyed in the 60's an 70's. The Monkees are pretty popular around here too.  Was able to obtain the soundtrack on CD through Amazon,(much thanks). My nephew loves the song Question Me An Answer sung by the late Bobby Van and kids in the cast.  The song by James Shigeta about making a family is timeless and beautiful sung in his rich voice.  Olivia Hussey and Sally Kellerman's song about comparing their lives is fun and rings true even today.  This is one of the CD's we take when we travel.  Sure wished we could get a copy of the movie on DVD.  It might not be eveyone's cup of tea but for good clean fun, and suspense, with music that stays with you this movie is awesome.  It is not the best movie ever made I will concede, but the first review makes me wonder if said reviewer likes anything that does not have an R rating.",1170374400,13,964,4.229508196721311

Michael Yorke, George Kennedy, Sally Kellerman, Bobby Van & others by Ross Hunters productions.

The sound track for this movie is available but not the DVD & VHS version.

I do hope it will be available soon. This is a superb & fantastic movie which I had seen in the cinema ages ago. It is a great movie and I still prefer this movie than the 1937 version by Ronald Coleman.

This movie I watched to the end, but spent much time laughing and cringing.  While its not a comedy, its certainly laughable and cringeworthy.  It actually starts off really well, though, if you basically disregard the main characters.  They are fleeing China during a revolution in the 1930s, and are hijacked for unknown reasons; leaving them crashed in the snow in the Himalayas, and eventually being rescued by a group of men from a land called Shangri-La.  The end of the movie also is not bad, if, once again, you basically disregard the main characters.

Its what happens in-between the beginning and the end of the movie that is so laughable. Many claim its the soundtrack that killed the movie, but I would argue its actually the soundtrack that makes the movie watchable and memorable . . . well, as memorable as this movie can possibly be.  Not all the songs, mind you, but some are quite good.  What killed the movie was the mismatched cast and all the ludicrous dancing. Peter Finch, too, does not come across like a man who is tired of the outside world, a man who is tired of the sound of guns pounding in his ears.  He comes across like a man whos not really fazed by anything, and thinks a place like Shangri-La is a terribly nice idea.  Sometimes he also comes across like Captain von Trapp.  Moreover, other times he looks like a man who belongs in a 1950s or 60s western.  Who dressed those people and why?

And why did I so love&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-Horizon/dp/B01A1LLNBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost Horizon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godspell/dp/B003PWZDF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godspell</a>&nbsp;as a teenager?
