8706769,4,B00UGRBKQ0,"Until it gets a complete restoration and blue ray release, this is the best version of this great musical out there, fortunately, I bought it when it was at a much more reasonable price. The main complaint is the sound is a little low, but picture wise, very watchable and in widescreen, with trailer and deleted song by Doris Day. The Pajama Game is one of my top 5 all time great musicals, and why it hasn't been shown the same respect as the likes of 'My Fair Lady' and 'Singing in the Rain' I just don't know. All the songs are good, and some are great, most of the original Broadway cast return, with the exception of Doris Day replacing Janice Page, as they needed a big screen name, and Doris fits in perfectly, hard to picture anyone else doing it. One of the greats that is far too neglected!",1495843200,6,801,4.311258278145695
