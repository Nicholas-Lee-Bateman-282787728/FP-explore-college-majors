7891447,4,6305510873,"I seen this movie years ago on the Sci Fi Channel.
It's about a solar storm that heats up the Earth and the story is good for a B movie I liked the plot
for the movie plenty of interesting characters.
I had to dust off my VCR in order to watch this movie, I just wish they would include this in a DVD pack.
Oh and Paramount please release the TV show Seven Days on DVD!!! You would be surprised how many people
would buy it.",1408752000,,424,3.8850574712643677

7891449,3,6305510873,"This was an interesting concept for a movie.  A solar flair burst bigger than anything ever recorded is headed toward Earth.  The temperature begins to rise on what is already a hot summer.  The movie focuses on Los Angeles  and how the city copes with the rising heat.  The main characters are a  local high school teacher, who is also a member of the National Guard, a  Doctor who can no longer practice because of a patient's death, a lifeguard  from a local beach, who is also a medical tech and her bad boy  ex-boyfriend, also a General who has been sent to LA to try and keep the  city under control until the solar wave passes over Earth. The city is  placed under Marshall Law as the temp soars to around 140 degrees and  starts baking the city along with the cast.  Not a bad story but could have  been better.",961200000,10,819,4.302631578947368
