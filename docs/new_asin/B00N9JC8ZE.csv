6618699,5,B00N9JC8ZE,"Love it. Love it. Love it!!

I've watched this 3 times since it arrived in my mailbox. If you enjoyed their previous DVDs Walk with Me In Hell and Killadelphia, you will love this one that much more. The film is mostly focused on Randy and his tumultuous journey thus far. It keeps you glued to your television and holding your bladder till its done. You don't have to love the band or have heard any of their songs to appreciate the amazing story that's told. You remember how Metallica's Some Kind of Monster began as one idea and eventually became something completely different yet way more satisfying?

My girlfriend pretty much only listens to top 40 and pop stations, and she thoroughly enjoyed it. Spread the word and help me bring more to the winning team.",1416268800,6,765,4.576642335766423

6618705,5,B00N9JC8ZE,"This was well worth the wait. When this came out in Oklahoma City, it was only shown for a few weeks, and when I found out about it, it was out of the theatres. I was able to order it through the bands website, and I just finished watching it. Incredible. The things that this band has gone through is amazing, and they are still kicking ass. I felt bad for Randy, because he just got sober a year ago, and then he gets blamed for this tragedy. There is a twist in the case, but, I will not spoil it. The most uplifting parts of the movie, is that when Randy comes back from being in jail, and the band is there to greet him at the airport, and also, when the verdict is read.
I have to also say that it was nice seeing fans around the world, and how their music inspired them. I hope that anyone that is going through a bad time, can watch this video, and realize that there is hope through any obstacle. Please buy the DVD!!",1412985600,12,926,4.038043478260869

6618708,4,B00N9JC8ZE,"I'm a big fan of Lamb Of God so I might be a little biased, But I think this documentary performed very well at showing how hard metal bands have to work to keep their music going in these times, while also showing the emotional and physical strength of these guys based on what they had to go though.",1430697600,,301,4.11864406779661
6618709,4,B00N9JC8ZE,Well worth the money. Can't go wrong with any video with how the band coreographs their visual image put with their music.,1430352000,,122,4.590909090909091

6618712,5,B00N9JC8ZE,"This a a raw documentary about music at its fines, and at its most scariest. Everyone needs to watch this to see what fans are about, and tragic things that can go horribly wrong during live shows.",1428019200,,197,4.351351351351352

6618715,5,B00N9JC8ZE,"A good documentary, but not as good as Killadelphia and Walk with me in hell.
This focuses too much on the trial, it gets a bit boring at times. True that it was a serious event, but it was given too much attention.
More time and creativity should have been thrown into it.
Nevertheless, a good Doc and hope to see more.",1424304000,,320,4.17741935483871

6618718,5,B00N9JC8ZE,"One of the most intense, emotional, and inspiring documentaries I have ever seen.  I adore Lamb of God, and this third documentary showing the darkest moment in the band's history at the height of their success is arresting, riveting, and visceral in the best possible ways.  Highly recommend it for any fan of the band, any fan of music or musicians, or simply someone who wants to travel down an intense emotional path.",1422230400,,421,4.7534246575342465

6618720,5,B00N9JC8ZE,"Exceptional video for diehard LoG fans. You get a ton of insight into the band, particularly Randy Blythe, and get to see fans from all over the world. Be warned, about half of the video is related to Randy's arrest and trial, but it also answers a lot of questions and dispels rumors (like none of the videos circulating online which claim to be footage of the kid that died are actually footage of the kid that died).",1419724800,,419,4.384615384615385
6618721,5,B00N9JC8ZE,I love this dvd. When randy first got arrested I was completely bummed but I knew he didn't do it. What's messed up is that a L.O.G fan lost his life in all this. Recommend this to any Lamb fan or heavy metal fan in general. You won't be disappointed.,1419206400,,251,4.04

8676672,4,B00N9JC8ZE,"While I would definitely consider this a must-see for hardcore fans of lamb of god, after reading Randy's book I didn't find it to be any more informative or eye-opening. The interviews with several hard rock and metal legends were interesting (especially the bonus features with extended interviews), and it was awesome to see some fans from around the world share their stories and the way lamb of god has helped them in one way or another.

Several times I found myself feeling as though the sale of this film is more of a way for the band to get their feet back under them financially more than anything else. However, as lamb of god has been one of my favorite bands for the last decade or so, I have absolutely no problem with this and would have gladly paid more for the DVD if it means that they can continue to do what they do as musicians and as bandmates. lamb of god's impact on their fans is immeasurable, and I hope to see them continue to make music together for as long as they can stand each other. They've certainly helped me out in a few tough spots, and they will always have my support because of that.",1444003200,,1123,4.347619047619047
8676673,5,B00N9JC8ZE,"As a big fan of the band, and could't see the movie in the teather, I had to buy this dvd. It's really interesting.",1441411200,,115,3.8333333333333335
8676674,4,B00N9JC8ZE,Its a look inside the band. Would like to see more concert footage.,1438646400,,67,4.230769230769231
