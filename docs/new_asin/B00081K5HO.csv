8055279,4,B00081K5HO,"All the Tintin DVDs (all together 21 adventures) are avaiable in www.amazon.co.uk site in ENGLISH, with reasonable price. These are brand new and original DVDs. I received my order in 7 days by airmail. Why will you pay so much money to buy ""USED"" DVDs??

The UK DVDs are of Region-2 - but most of the recent DVD players, specially the cheaper one, can now play DVDs of any region - with no problem!!",1126396800,2,400,4.405405405405405
8055280,5,B00081K5HO,"This was one of the first Tintin movies I got as a child and I remember I was hooked on it for quite a while. Although the animation in this movie is not as good or as Herge-esque like the most recent Tintin series, the animation is really good considering it was made back in '72. The story starts with Tintin, Captain Haddock and the Thompson Twins heading to Syldavia ( a fictional Balkan state that Herge used in several of his books) to visit Professor Calculus, who has just created a revolutionary machine that could copy 3D objects. But things start turning sinister since the Professor lives out by a lake that the locals think is haunted. Wierd happenings start to plague Tintin and the gang at the Professor's villa, and soon they find out that someone is after the professor's new invention.",1111708800,5,803,4.583333333333333
