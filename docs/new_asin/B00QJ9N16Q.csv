6871846,3,B00QJ9N16Q,"The CARMEN legend gets a Spaghetti Western makeover in Director Luigi Bazzoni's 'MAN, PRIDE. AND VENGEANCE' aka 'L'UOMO, L'OROLOGIO. LA VENDETTA'- `1967.  Fresh from his hit Director Sergio Corbucci's 'DJANGO'-1966, actor Franco Nero plays the tragic soldier infatuated with the gypsy prostitute Carmen played by cult actress Tina Aumont.  Along for the ride is actor Klaus Kinski as her sleazy outlaw husband and a small cameo by Franco Ressel.  With a nice flamenco guitar score by Carlo Rusticelli and beautiful photography by the Director's brother Camillo Bazzoni. it never achieves the epic status that it deserves.  The Western action takes second place to the love triangle and tragedies that Carmen puts the soldier through as she slowly destroys his life but its slow in coming.  The archivists at Blue Underground have found the original negative and the transfer is flawless in HD 1080p with a 2.35 aspect ratio which looks like it was made yesterday.  You can enjoy the English dubbed version or the original Italian track with English, Spanish. or French sub titles.  Extras include an audio commentary with 2 journalists Henry Parke and C. Courtney Joyner which I have not heard , a great interview with actor Franco Nero and cameraman Vittorio Storaro in Italian with English sub titles.  Nero has great stories on the shoot plus his take on coming to America , Italian and International trailers and a poster and stills gallery.  Director Bazzoni would direct Franco Nero again in the excellent Giallo 'THE FIFTH CORD' aka ' GIORNATA NERA PER L'ARIETE'-1971 but this Western only starts cooking at its climax with a brutal fist fight between Kinski and Nero.  It's worth it just for that.",1447891200,4,1705,5.057142857142857

6871850,4,B00QJ9N16Q,"A wonderful Spaghetti Western take on ""Carmen"". Franco Nero is excellent as the tragic soldier Don Jose who falls for the heartless gypsy Carmen (Tina Aumont). The 2.35 widescreen transfer is great and special mention should be made of the effective background score for Spanish guitar and orchestra by Carlo Rustichelli. It greatly inhances the drama of the film as any good movie score should. I've wanted to see this movie for a long time and I wasn't disappointed. There is also a terrific onscreen interview with Nero as an extra.",1433808000,6,535,4.8901098901098905

8691526,4,B00QJ9N16Q,"Wow!! Nero is beautiful and sorrowful...Carmen knows how to get the men all up in a roar. Got to read the novella Carmen, the movie basis, now.
