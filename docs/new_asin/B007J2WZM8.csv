Although I knew him best as Hank Yarborough on Corner Gas, Dan for Mayor lets you see a lot more of his dimension as a comic actor.  Great show, wish it would have had more seasons!",1384214400,8,294,4.232142857142857
5090444,3,B007J2WZM8,"It's humorous and entertaining and, essentially, it's Fred Ewanuick doing his  Hank schtick. Loved Corner Gas, so I'll follow the cast to check-out their post-Gas endeavors.",1367539200,7,173,5.653846153846154

8518149,5,B007J2WZM8,"My girlfriend and I really loved this show.  Too bad it ended so quickly.  And for some reason the second season is unavailable for purchase.  I want more!

Good clean show with a lighthearted quirky sense of humor.  Very relaxing. Original feel, other than Dan being roughly the same character as Hank which he played in Corner Gas.  Kind of like they took Hank wiped his memory and put him in a different situation and added about 9 IQ points to his character.  Loved Ayers character Mike Norman.  He's hysterical.",1467072000,,516,4.655555555555556

8518153,2,B007J2WZM8,"I bought this hoping for a comedy similar in composition to Corner Gas.  Not even in the same league.  Whereas ""Dan"" was a great supporting actor for Brent Butt, he fails at being the lead.  There are a few moments when the show could start to gel, however, the show never gets past the word could.

I watched the first three episodes before ejecting the DVD.",1415145600,2,359,4.393939393939394
