8741589,5,B0186EOJUS,"TNA Slammiversary 2015 was a great show I loved it. I am a big TNA Fan since day one and like the New TNA. I think TNA is improving and will continue to get better. This strong ppv shows they are on their way.

  Elimination Match: X Division Champion Tigre Uno vs. DJ Zema Ion vs. Manik. Match was awesome. X division matches are always good and this was the right way to get the show started off.

Robbie E vs. Jesse Godders . This was a great match. Both men work well together and have good chemistry. I think Robbie is a great wrestler

Street Fight Match: Matt Morgan vs. Bram. Great Match. It was a fun brawl.  Matt Morgan has always been a great wrestler and should have been champ. Bram is a good wrestler too. It's good to see Matt Morgan home back on TNA.

Davey Richards vs. Austin Aries- Five Star Match. What else can be said these two guys are great workers. Aries has just gotten better and better over the years.

Awesome Kong & Brooke vs. The Dollhouse This was an okay match but I think Gail Kim should have been in it. I love The Dollhouse. Kong has been like the Female Version of Vader so dominant and cool and put on so many great matches. I think Brooke will only improve as she has great years ahead of her.

Unsanctioned Match: Magnus vs. James Storm. Loved the match and storyline. James Storm has always been one of my favorite wrestlers. I think it was best he left TNA for WWE though. He had his run with TNA as champ and tag champ. I feel like for TNA to be a success we need some fresh faces guys like Joe and Storm are TNA Legends but we need new Legends. Magnus and Storm had a great match. Storm always puts on a great match whoever he is with. Magnus is great. He ended Sting's TNA Career.

Lashley & Mr. Anderson vs. Ethan Carter III & Tyrus. Great match I love Lashley and think its great in TNA has him. He fits well here. Mr. Anderson is a great supporting player now he may not be a main eventer anymore but he still offers a lot. Ethan is going to be huge superstar. He will be a TNA Legend. He's a very talented wrestled. I love Tyrus and think he is used well here as a villian where in WWE he had a stupid gimmick. He's a monster and I am glad he's used right now.

King Of The Mountain Championship Match: Jeff Jarrett vs. Bobby Roode vs. Matt Hardy vs. Drew Galloway vs. Eric Young - Best match of the night. I was so happy to see Jarrett win. He Founded TNA he is a big reason they are still in business. He built a foundation. Nice of Dixie to put him in TNA Hall Of Fame where he belongs. This was a great match with 5 great workers who told a great story. A great way to cap off the night.

  Note: The DVD on Amazon is not available now but you can get it on The TNA Shopzone Under The DVDS on The TNA Website.

  I recommend this to all TNA fans and all wrestling fans. TNA is great and a great alternative to WWE. I like it better than WWE. TNA has changed for the better and this is a new TNA. It's back on track and with WWE's rating dropping rapidly eventually TNA will be able to compete with WWE. Cheers and Enjoy!",1450310400,,3073,4.061258278145695
8741590,3,B0186EOJUS,"My expectations were high for this show but didn't live up to the height. But this show on the DVD watch honestly wasn't bad at all. Was much better on the 2nd watch. Most of the audio issues they had during the live ppv were corrected for the DVD. They deleted the 5 minutes of crowd shot and the ring introduction of the main event. To correct the issues they used the rebroadcast of the main event they showed a few weeks later on impact in its entirety, with brand new commentary. Plus we get Jeff Jarrett's HOF induction. The DVD is a big improvement.",1448323200,,556,4.304761904761905
8741591,3,B0186EOJUS,"Elimination Match: X Division Champion Tigre Uno vs. DJ Zema Ion vs. Manik - You saw all three men using similar offense in the early moments such as lucha libre offense from head scissors to planchas to the outside along with the same strategy of working over both opponents at the same time including sequences that effected all three competitors featuring big moves & reversals along with having a domino effect while one opponent attempted the smart strategy of divide & conquer in what was a solid X division match.

Robbie E vs. Jessie Godderz - The battle of the BroMans with Robbie having a more serious attitude than we've ever seen before as the brawl started on the floor using whatever he could to get the advantage on while Jessie targeted a specific body part & heavily attacked it using his strength for various power moves & submission attempt in what was a solid contest.

Street Fight Match: Matt Morgan vs. Bram - Bram had been recently challenging & defeating former members of the TNA roster with Morgan issuing the challenge of this being a street fight before the match started as both men started out exchanging punches with Morgan using his size & athleticism to his advantage before Bram played to his strength going hardcore taking the fight to the floor using weapons only for Morgan to use weapons to his advantage as well in what was a watchable brawl with clearly the late moments in the match didn't go as planned causing the match seem like it went on ""pause"" for a few moments with the heavy stalling.

Davey Richards vs. Austin Aries - Both men's respective teams (Aries in ""Dirty Heels"" with Bobby Rodde & Richards with Eddie Edwards as ""The Wolves"") were in a best of seven match series for the vacant TNA Tag Team Championship with the final match set for the upcoming episode of Impact so this was to determine who got to pick the stipulation to that match.  Both men attempted to get momentum only for Aries to keep stalling going to the ropes or outside whenever Davey was about to mount a series of offense causing Davey to lose his cool resorting to brawling tactics on the outside only for Aries to catch him with various aerial & grounded offense while Davey came back aggressively only for Aries to match the intensity with both men executing similar moves against each other such as suicide dives & missile dropkicks while trading forearms & headbutts & chops as this was a very competitive match that just got more physical & intense over time.

Awesome Kong & Brooke vs. The Dollhouse - This was a handicap tag match with Kong & Brooke already set to have a title match against Knockouts Champion & Dollhouse leader Taryn Tarrell later that week on Impact.  Kong was dominate against Jade & Marti early on with their offense having no effect on her causing the Dollhouse to single out Brooke attempting to keep her away from her partner while taking advantage of the referee to double & triple team in what was an average match that was more about telling the story in regards to Taryn & the Dollhouse based off her participation (or lack of) in this match while building to the title match on Impact.

Unsanctioned Match: Magnus vs. James Storm - This match started out exactly how you expected it knowing the match stipulation & how personal their issues have gotten where this was a brawl right from the start on the floor & going through different areas of the arena to the point where they caused ""technical issues"" not only during the match but the rest of the show while one of the competitors taking a comment by an announcer too personally & even getting physical with the referee as they used various weapons such as tables in some unique ways to either beat on each other & put a body through it as this was one hell of a brawl.

Lashley & Mr. Anderson vs. Ethan Carter III & Tyrus - EC3 was already set to have his TNA Championship match at on the next episode of Impact so his opponents here are two men he got recent victories over with the help of his partner & bodyguard Tyrus as both men were able to work over EC3 only for Tyrus to get involved behind the referee to help get the advantage for his team as they continued to use dirty & illegal tactics while singling out one competitor from tagging his partner with different distractions in what was an average tag match.

King Of The Mountain Championship Match: Jeff Jarrett vs. Bobby Roode vs. Matt Hardy vs. Drew Galloway vs. Eric Young - This was the return of TNA's signature match for the first time in 5 years (before the Hogan/Bischoff era of TNA) also introducing a new King Of The Mountain Championship (which is the old Legends/Global/Television Title with a black strap).  Now for those who never seen a the King Of The Mountain match before, it's a ladder match in reverse with a lot of stipulations. To win the match, you have to use the ladder to hang the belt instead of pulling it down like a normal ladder match. However before you can hang the belt, you have to qualify to do it by scoring a pinfall/submission over one of the other competitors with the person who loses that fall goes into a penalty box for 2 mins. It sounds real gimmicky but it's a real easy match to follow when you watch it all come together.
The biggest story coming into this match was the return of the original ""King Of The Mountain"" winner Jeff Jarrett to TNA after his much publicized exit from the company over two years earlier to start his own Global Force wrestling promotion only to appear back in TNA earlier in the week to have this final match allowing him to leave the company on his own terms but as Josh Matthews pointed out on commentary makes Jarrett an outsider to the rest of the participants in this match as other stories & highlights throughout the match including one man ""spending more time in the penalty box than the match itself"" to the point where he was only out of the penalty box for a few seconds before he was pinned & had to go back in, different moves sending opponents into the ladders throughout the match including one piledriver that you had to see to believe, more than one person in the penalty box at one time, a reunion of former teammates & champions from the past, one competitor having pins constantly stolen from him so he couldn't qualify, the return of a signature weapon we haven't seen in years, one man's daredevil leap off the penalty box, and Karen Jarrett's outfit (I'm obviously joking but seriously she looked beautiful) resulting in a good main event with everyone taking some hard hits & bumps while telling different stories.

It's no secret about the state of TNA wrestling during this time causing some of the same issues that effected their previous live PPV ""Bound For Glory"" as their main priority & focus is on their Impact Wrestling television to the point where the episodes following this PPV were taped earlier in the week BEFORE this live event leading to various matches on the show your paying for coming off as fillers with no other purpose than to build to the show later in the week for free & many championships not defended here (TNA World & Tag Titles) & also due to an unfortunate ""contractual error"" with one of their talents caused some of these matches shown for free on their pre-taped television show for several weeks.  In the end, this PPV is a perfect example of TNA Wrestling right now where if you ignore everything going on behind the scenes & strictly focus on the in-ring action then it came off very similar to their ""One Night Only"" series where it was an average show on it's own with some solid to standout matches (KOTM, Magnus/Storm, Richards/Aries, X Division) that are worth watching but nothing to go out of your way to see.",1448323200,,7738,4.5549964054636956
8741592,3,B0186EOJUS,"The Tigre Uno vs. Manik vs. DJ Z in an elimination match for the X Division Title was a good effort from all three men, but it's really hard to care about a title match when the three men have been treated like glorified jobbers for so long. It's going to take more than winning a green title belt to make viewers see Uno as more than an enhancement guy. This is a baby step in that direction, but he needs a strong opponents. The Robbie E vs. Jessie Godderz match while not bad,went on longer than it needed to. Robbie hasn't connected as a babyface yet. The Bram-Matt Morgan-street fight was your basic TNA streetfight with no real sursprises. The Austin Aries vs. Davey Richards bout to determine the stipulation for the final match of the best of five series for the vacant TNA Tag Titles was the best match of the night thus far. The finish was pretty lame. They had a really good match and then it ended with a distraction and a rollup. It's too bad they didn't just have Aries go over strong. The Taryn Terrell, Marti, and Jade vs. Awesome Kong and Brooke match was a weak & boring bout to say the least. The Magnus vs. James Storm streetfight was a hardcore,smash-mouth brawl despite  some goofs and the ending. The EC3 and Tyrus vs. Lashley and Mr. Anderson tag team while not bad,was better off on free tv. The 5 Way King of the Mountain match for the KOTM title (Jeff Jarrett vs. Bobby Roode vs. Matt Hardy vs. Drew Galloway vs. Eric Young) was a mess. Everyone tried hard, but the King of the Mountain match has always been a disaster and this was no exception. I give this event a 6 out of 10.",1447804800,,1606,4.3003300330033
