2530736,5,B000ERH7H8,"This dvd is an excellent guide to adding beautiful veil work to your belly dance routine.  This dvd seems suitable to a wide range of bellydancers from intermediate and more advanced dancers.  Advanced veil dancers may also learn something, but if you are already into complex veil work and double veil, you may find it a little basic.

I always appreciate dvd's that include an introductory segment including background information on the history and development of the art form. This dvd has a nice introduction that offers not only a brief background but basic concepts that you can use for technique covered in the dvd and beyond.

Aziza offers several helpful concepts that you can use to make the technique your own. She demonstrates using the veil as an extension of your body, catching air, posture, transitions, using the music and other useful ideas.

The dvd contains more than 9 veil moves with variations and several combinations.  For each move and combination, Aziza clearly breaks down the technique and offers useful tips on presentation and how to avoid common pitfalls. I found her breakdown corrected a few problems I have had with veil work.

As an instructor, Aziza is very engaging and comes across as friendly and fun. She breaks down the technique very clearly and provides flawless demonstrations. I love the way she has organized her presentation as the entire lesson flows logically and beautifully. The dvd concludes a fabulous performance by the instructor that demonstrates beautiful veil work.",1183334400,13,1525,5.076
8113577,4,B000ERH7H8,Anyone can tell me the name of the song for the choreography? I haven't purchased the DVD yet but watched part of it on Youtube. simply enchanting.,1401321600,,147,4.481481481481482
8113578,5,B000ERH7H8,"Everyone has pretty much covered it...just wanted to add, I agree for $35 it is a little short on content for the price compared to other DVDs (Sarah Skinners are great- I have both of them too)... but then again of you are really into learning veil, I think it's worth buying. I have alot of Veil instructionals and I find that each (teacher) gives different tips, information, and the nuances of working with the veil that are valuable to you as a dancer.
Aziza does a good job here, not a whole encyclopedia of veil moves but still alot of good material. She covers concepts here that I have not seen in others & the performance portion is great. This DVD really helped me understand how to put the moves together & dance with the veil so I could take my veil-work beyond the beginner level.

If you don't have a lot to spend & it's your first veil dvd- try ""Sarah Skinner's Bellydance with Veil"" (on Amazon)---But then make sure to come back and get this one, it's worth buying if you really serious about learning the veils.",1384473600,,1029,4.41578947368421
8113579,5,B000ERH7H8,"This is an awesome DVD, she has done so much for me to becoming a better veilest.  Lost first DVD, had to buy a second.",1363564800,,119,3.76
8113580,5,B000ERH7H8,"I keep this DVD in my collection for inspiration and as a reference.  I do like the fact that she bridges the gap between the beginner and the intermediate levels making it accessible for everyone. I have recommenced this DVD to several people because of that.  However I would say that my favorite is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smooth-as-Silk-Veil-Belly-Dance-with-Katia/dp/B000MS639W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smooth as Silk - Veil Belly Dance with Katia</a>&nbsp;Her unique take on veil is inspiring and goes beyond the Veil with Aziza.",1358553600,,592,6.481012658227848
8113581,5,B000ERH7H8,"Hands down this is the BEST for beginners to intermediates.  Sarah Skinner Belly Dance with Veil is very good also but acts more as a supplement to Aziza.  This DVD has numerous veil moves and tricks, explained clearly and has beautiful choreography and performance at the end.  Pick this one up first, im super glad I did!",1341792000,,323,4.631578947368421
8113582,4,B000ERH7H8,"Aziza's Veil DVD has some great information and material on technique, but I whole-heartily agree with one of the other reviewer's comments. It does not have an extensive catalogue of veil tricks or moves. This is why I gave it only four stars.

She is very professional and does do a very good job of teaching everything. She covers concepts of dancing with the veil so it has fluidity and grace -as an extension of you- not just a piece of fabric you are whipping around in the air.

There is a nice warm-up section geared towards preparing your body for working with the veil & a cool-down.

The chapters included are:
Introduction - (a little history on veils, veil choices/ different materials.
Concepts (Body Extension, Catching Air)
Posture/Warm-up
Technique (veil moves/tricks)
Cool-Down
Performance (costumed- Loved this! She is really wonderful to watch. I wished she had taught all of the tricks and veil transitions she does in her performance- this would have made the DVD more valuable to me.)

This is a great DVD for someone who is new to veil work, for it covers all the basics (posture, nice warm-up, basic veil technique, etc.).

 But if you are experienced in veil or looking for many different/new veil tricks.....I agree (again) with the same reviewer who recommended purchasing Aziza's Veil DVD with other veil DVDs, like ""Bellydance with Veil"" by Sarah Skinner or Shoshanna's ""Fabulous Four Yard Veils"".",1331856000,2,1427,4.949790794979079
8113583,4,B000ERH7H8,"While Aziza does a great job of teaching you several different veil moves in this DVD, it is not an exhaustive catalogue of moves, and therefore could be a disappointment to those looking for a DVD with dozens of moves. The greatest value of this DVD lies in the core concepts that Aziza emphasizes. These concepts will encourage you to go beyond the beginner style technique of linking isolated moves together. The best dancers are, after all, those whose bodies flow so smoothly along with the veil that they appear to be one being joined together, rather than a person holding a piece of fabric. Unfortunately, many dancers never get beyond the beginner stage with a veil and it shows in their dancing, which lacks the breath-taking fluidity and ethereal quality of the master dancer.

In order to handle the veil like a master dancer, you need to change your perspective on how the veil moves and on how you relate to the veil. Aziza helps you to make this shift in perspective with these core concepts.

I gave this DVD 4 stars primarily because the production quality is not very good. In addition, while Aziza's perspective on veil dancing will benefit many dancers, this DVD, at $35, is not a very good value compared to Sarah Skinner's extensive ""Bible"" of veil moves&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bellydance-with-Veil/dp/B000UZRT40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bellydance with Veil</a>. Ideally, I would recommend purchasing both DVD's, but if you have to choose, you will get far more mileage out of Sarah Skinner's DVD. It is one of those DVD's that you will want to keep forever and refer back to again and again.",1263772800,5,1669,5.132352941176471
8113584,2,B000ERH7H8,"If you are expecting to see an Aziza-style performance of her working her special brand of majic with the veil, you will be disappointed.  Presentation is a bit flat (not like her in real life at a workshop at all) and only basic moves are taught.  Good for the beginner dancer.",1256601600,3,278,4.431372549019608
8113585,5,B000ERH7H8,"This DVD is one of the best on the market for veil work. The technique is clearly demonstrated from the front and the back and the movements increase in difficulty as the video progresses. Learn: the Roman Cape, the Burrito, Sharita, the helicopter, etc. Aziza is a true belly dance master and a pleasure to watch teaching and dancing.",1217376000,5,335,4.694915254237288
8113586,5,B000ERH7H8,"I am so pleased with this video! Aziza does a fabulous job of explaining each technique step by step. She goes slow enough for you to actually follow along, she shows you the move from different angles, and she shows variations of each move.

She does a few combinations, which are very helpful for improving fluidity. I would like to see more veil work from this dancer. I wish the video was twice as long!",1188432000,7,407,4.426666666666667
