287520,5,6300269701,"One of the most brilliant motion pictures ever made, and a strong contender for the best British film of all time. ""O' Lucky Man"" originated in an idea from Malcolm McDowell about a coffee salesman  traveling throughout England. McDowell and director Lindsay Anderson, who  collaborated on ""If"" (winner of the 1969 Palme D'Or at Cannes)  resurrected the character of Mick Travis (McDowell) for an epic-length  feature in 1973. After several failed attempts by McDowell to write a  script, David Sherwin (""If..."") penned the screenplay.
""O' Lucky Man's"" greatest strength is its incredible scope: in  merely three hours, the film provides a nihilistic and a-humanist answer  for the meaning of life... a remarkable accomplishment for a single feature  film. As salesman Travis journeys across the United Kingdom and attempts to  sell coffee in England and Scotland, he has a series of loosely-connected  experiences with a series of individuals, played by eleven actors in  multiple roles, who represent fundamental literary archetypes. The  situations Travis encounters run the gamut of human experience, from  titillating and humorous to wildly surreal to sublime and poetic -- yet all  revolve around the picture's central theme: that true success in life  depends exclusively on luck and chance, instead of ethics or morality.  Sherwin and Anderson handle the story's constant shifts in mood with  finesse and ease, and during the picture's three-hour running time, every  scene (without exception) packs a huge punch. Thematically, ""O' Lucky  Man"" draws from classic allegories, notably ""Candide.""  Stylistically, it includes strong Brechtian elements (Anderson's  cuts-to-black at the end of each scene continually remind us that we're  watching a FILM) and incorporates a few striking cinematic allusions,  notably an homage to Coppola's final shot in ""The Godfather.""  Thus, one could argue that Anderson's epic qualifies as the definitive  modernist film.
The true test of ""O' Lucky Man's"" excellence,  however, is its ability to reveal new layers of meaning with repetition.  Even after watching the film ten or twelve times, one can leave refreshed  with new wisdom and insight.
British music-hall performer Alan Price  wrote the film's incredible score, and makes several guest appearances as  himself. Price and his band (seen in occasional cutaways) act as a Greek  chorus and serenade Mick Travis during his journey.
Tragically, in the  British Film Institute's poll for the top 100 British films of all time,  this didn't even make the cut.
Two interesting pieces of trivia about  ""O' Lucky Man"": first, according to the British Board of Film  Classification ([...] the film was originally rated X  upon release (like ""If...""), and ran at about 185 minutes  (fifteen minutes longer than the American and European video versions).  Thus, an X-rated version still exists... somewhere. But unfortunately, the  more explicit cut hasn't received any distribution on videocassette and is  difficult, perhaps impossible, to obtain. (One might be able to view it  through private British collections and archives). Second, the incredible  soundtrack by Alan Price resurfaced briefly on compact disc in late 1995,  but went out-of-print approximately two years later. For anyone who would  like to purchase a copy of the album, cd issues **are** available. I would  suggest searching for the rerelease in used compact disc shops.",951091200,149,3435,5.434535104364326
287521,5,6300269701,"My all-round favorite film.  Favorite because of its scope, Brit humor and enduring power to pick me up when I am down.  Malcom McDowell's expressions throughout are bildungsroman in action.  Music is amazing, and heralded a  life-long love affair (sadly from a distance) with Alan Price, a sort of  music hall Randy Newman.  Band/party sequences are fabulous! Movie endures  beyond intellectual collegiate urge to deconstruct symbolism.  I like it  even better than Shirley Temple's The Little Princess, another fave.  Better than Robert Altman.  'Course, I'm one of the few who like Ishtar (at  least parts)....But then I also adored Bullworth.",944352000,6,646,5.35
287567,5,6300269701,This is a great movie if you saw it when it came out. Really captured the zeitgeist for a small demographic of which some of us were a part--artsy boys and angsty girls. Can't recommend it to newcomers.,1482278400,,202,4.342105263157895
287568,5,6300269701,"This the second film in a Lindsay Anderson trilogy, the first being if... and the third Britannia Hospital. Whether Anderson was making films or directing in the theatre his work is a challenging and acerbic commentary on 1960s and 70s Britain. All is films have a quasi surreal quality to them and should not be viewed as a straightforward dramatic narrative. If approached in this way then they will disappoint. It is also true to say that the humour at times can appear dated and if the viewer isn't acquainted with the pomposity of the British Establishment, much will come across as obscure. This is sounds rather negative but the film is, in its own right, a great piece of 'independent' British cinema. (And Anderson loathed the Hollywood film-making sausage machine as much as he loathed the Establishment.) Malcolm McDowell takes the lead and gives a fine and nuanced performance as the travelling salesman. Sadly, it was to be his last good film and he is ably supported by Anderson's ensemble company some of whom doubled up roles. But the highlight of the film - if truth be told - is the film-within-a-film, the story of Alan Price and his band. This DVD is the best edition available and is a worthy addition to anyones collection of British cinema.",1470268800,2,1263,4.771689497716895

It was certainly quirky.  If our guest hadn't been determined to watch it to the end, I'd have turned it off after 20 minutes.  A naive coffee salesman's misadventures at the start of his career?  At the time it was made, I suspect it was intended as a thinly veiled commentary on capitalism and its pitfalls.  I guess this led those who like the film to label it as a dark comedy.  I would label it as a three-hour march towards boredom.  Its plot is abstruse and serpentine.  The film's credits include a note indicating that the film was based on an ""idea"" of Malcolm McDowell's.

Watching this now one begins to appreciate the great talent of Malcolm McDowell.  Released around the same time as Clockwork Orange but seemingly forgotten by audiences and critics alike, this story allows the actor to play an everyman type forced to confront the brutal reality of life vs the somewhat nave worldview he was raised in.  Great music and good fun, should be required viewing in all public schools.  For a darker vision by Anderson also featuring McDowell get a copy of another fim from the late 60's:  ""....if"" now available in a Criterion edition.",1395792000,,667,5.027272727272727

287702,4,6300269701,"My first exposure (like many others) to Malcolm McDowell was A Clockwork Orange. I became quite enamoured of his acting and eagerly sought out his other works. My next find was his leading star role in Lindsey Anderson's if... It remains my favourite McDowell film and begins the trilogy of Anderson film's starring McDowell as three different characters all named Mick Travis. Yes they are not the same person, as Lindsey and others have pointed out.
In O Lucky Man this Mick is an upcoming coffee salesman, who seems rather successful and is given his own territory in northern England. Unlike if...., O Lucky Man has that bizarre British surrealism almost out of the gate. He meets up an oddball series of characters many played by the actors from if.... .along with a few that also starred in Clockwork, primarily Philip Stone. These actors seem to show up as different characters with in Lucky Man, many with no lines.
A an allegory it reflects the growing capitalism in the UK.
A very young and very pretty Helen Mirren appears as the leading lady.
Mick ends up in many odd adventures most notably (spoilers)

A research facility where escapes after finding a man whose head has been grafted to a sheep's body. he gets framed for embezzlement by Patricia's (Mirren) wealthy fater, spends time in jail, becomes a humanist, meets up with a rock band (who actually provided all the music) and gets an interesting meal when he enters a small country church that has food for god piled at the alter..
If dark British humour is not your cuppa then go elsewhere. As I said while a good movie it is no where near the genius of if...., and watching this nor Britannia Hospital are necessary to see and enjoy ""if...."", unless you enjoy McDowell and Lyndsey's works.",1395187200,,1761,4.717532467532467
287703,4,6300269701,"Finally got around to seeing this film after a few decades.  The music from the film has held up extremely well but the whole film seems a bit dated.  Still love the actors and their multiple roles and the premise of the film as a commentary on life in general.  If it wasn't for the music, this would be much harder to view in its entirety.  It would have been better to have the entire film recorded onto one disc.",1394582400,,416,4.1625
287704,5,6300269701,"Sad to report that the cinema styling of Lindsay Anderson is now almost gone from the world of film enthusiasm. He is forgotten, obviously, because he just wasn't sensational enough for American audiences. But ""O Lucky Man!"" is a kind of unique fantasy story, both masturbatory and culturally significant, because of its fine slow pacing, its quiet story, its rowdy scenes inside of an adult club (Anderson was never too afraid to show nudity and sexual content but, as always, there was a point to it all), and its fantastic music score from the hot and bothered Alan Price and his rocking band. ""O Lucky Man!"", in fact, reminds me of what I enjoy so much about movies, and why I still can't get over them to this day. If you are looking for action and adventure and silliness typical of American vehicles here, you won't find it. Anderson was always too much of a pessimist to move that far outside of reality, and God bless him for that! This film is so much more entertaining because it is laid back, because it does not rely upon violence for its effectiveness, and because it has a strong sense of humor and deliberate pacing that is both adult and ridiculous in its own way. In short, this is the kind of eccentric, oddball, and masterfully written movie that we probably won't see any longer, because this kind of relaxed, humorous sensibility is almost gone in the contemporary age. McDowell is fantastic here, and I think it is deeply sad that he has had to remain so underused in modern movies. Anyone who thinks he can't go deeper than the gleeful sadism of ""A Clockwork Orange"" (another movie that I love because of its ""movieness"" alone) should watch his performance here before judging the man--but most have, sadly, forgotten this title. Any film where a grown man can end up lying on his side while breast suckling a grown adult woman in the storehouse of some orchard is obviously worth your time. We won't be seeing another Lindsay Anderson.
The DVD is great, although I was a bit put off that the movie is split right down the middle on 2 separate discs. However, the extras more than make up for this. There is a great audio commentary that is worth the price alone--one simply has to hear it, it explains itself. There is also the great feature ""O Lucky Malcolm"" which is essential for film completists. And, finally, a great featurette on the making of this film which is actually quite a rare find. It's about time that a great transfer of this fine title came to DVD, with a widescreen format and a great soundtrack. If you are tired of the violence and sickness of our modern movies, and you have a desire to return to the old days of great moviemaking (the 70's) where the anxieties of modern life were less and the proliferation of technology was not as great, then ""O Lucky Man!"" is the escape for you--providing that you have the sensibility to accept it. Oh, the days when we had human beings around, sigh...This film is rated R for some adult material, but other than one particularly randy sequence there is nothing overtly offensive throughout the film. If you like Malcolm, you'll love it. A+",1392768000,3,3127,4.595706618962433

287739,3,6300269701,"Having seen this movie last night, I decided to wait 24 hours for a ""full"" comprehension of this FLAWED product.........
Although the so-called ""heat of the moment"" made me consider it a minor masterpiece, by now it has been degraded to ""I like it"".......
Why is this?
I consider a masterpiece that which continues to ""haunt"" you for days,for weeks, indeed for YEARS......alas, this is already slipping away, and the ""contrivances"" of the film are mediocre enough that it remains a mystery to me as to why the movie is still consider masterly.
Some points that give credence to my disappointment:
The movie seems interminable for the first hour or so, until it magically picks up and becomes a very good piece of ENTERTAINMENT.
Forget the ""socialist"" mumbo-jumbo that this ""auteur"" (?) tries to instill into the movie....although for sure the movie proves to be more than a touch relevant to social issues that remain as compelling today as always, it is still a shallow film, perhaps because of its parodic insistence.......
Dubbed a ""black comedy"", perhaps it is such but after awhile the film becomes a curious ""ONE-NOTE"".......
Sharing the evening with a friend, our constant joke (and disappointment) was that the next ""episode"" would offer us the same thing again and again......Our hero, filled with innocent hope (more than a little laughable--------of course, magnified to give a ""stronger"" meaning to the events) goes through the same INTERMINABLE debacle.........Hope for a better future, being as greedy as he is with success and material wealth, he is constantly embattled by the forces that prey in him due to his, arguably, stupidity.......
Indeed the movie aims for a parable, a giant metaphor on us, the human species, and it is more than fulfilling that it touches you for its duration with its show of constant hope crushed by the realities of this mean, opportunistic world out there. Perhaps a serious drama would have clung to us in a more profound way, but here it barely works.
Mr. McDowell proves himself a rather limited actor, delivering lines and gestures that have a curious resemblance to ""Clockwork Orange"".
Indeed, for the first part of the movie, whether parodic or not, the movie resembles more than  not ""Clockwork..."". It is almost bizarre to see the principal character go through all these tribulations (jail time, being experimented with, living in a room that resembles (poorly) Alex's room in ""C.O"", suffering and constant recovery with no learning whatsoever, and EVEN throwing himself out of a window in despair)..... You wonder how Kubrick took all this, whether an honor or a simple grab of material that clearly appears robbed. Given Kubrick's megalomania and severity, you will tend to conclude that the former is closer to the truth......
The movie, indeed, verges on NIHILISM, and it places you in the philosophical state of mind that after all, life is meaningless so we might as well do the best we can and even take what's there, because after all, if you don't take it, then I certainly will........
BLEAK-------and more than a little timelessly true......,..,
A brilliant addition is the equivalent of what  you might interpret as a greek chorus (albeit in a rather simplistic way) offering  you all these ""truths"", philosophical as they are, about the tragedy of life.
An interesting discovery is HELEN MIRREN, forty years ago, rather much less ""beautiful"" than she came to photograph as time went by. Funny how many of us had been beautiful in our youth---turning into gargoyles as old age approaches, and that rare individual who ages with greater and greater ""beauty"", dignity, so that you come to truly believe that looks DID improve over the passing of years........
Fascinating in its own curious way, unfortunately ""Lucky Man"" is one of those works of art that are filled with ""hope"" and yet end in disappointment as being too much of a conceit, a dream of a project that ultimately turns unrealizable.................
Come to think of it, its conclusion ironically offers us the very same exact metaphor that the movie insists on proving----------you constantly hope for the best (those that do) yet end up disillusioned at the end of it all.........",1387324800,2,4213,5.024320457796852

No!  They were filming the scene for O LUCKY MAN right after Mick Travis a.k.a. Malcom is attacked by the homeless folk.  So I asked the man with the camera if I could be one of the passersby who criss-cross in front of Malcolm as he makes his way from the alley to the street sidewalk - and yes, indeed, 18 years old, callow, thrilled, I went before the cameras for the very first time in my life - the professional camera mind you - and I thought what a great start to my month-long adventure!  And a few days later I found myself breakfasting a table away from the best Scrooge ever, Alastair Sim himself! This whilst staying at Portmeirion, the location for Patrick McGoohan's The Village in his cult TV series ""The Prisoner"" - geez, two big British actors in the flesh in a few days time, wow! So I nervously asked Mr. Sim for his autograph and he said ""No, I don't think so"" and this absolutely crushed me!  It seemed he really was a Scrooge - and I had just seem him the day before on the London screen in a great British film THE RULING CLASS -another quirky film with a cult following that I highly recommend  - anyway, as Mr. Sim walked up the hill to the Green Dome (was he the real Number Two?)I was flattened by his cold refusal to give a fan his John Hancock.  This preyed on my mind for years until the IMDB.com revealed to me in its section on triva about Alastair Sim that he NEVER gave autographs! Misery loves company - so it wasn't something solely and strictly about me at all.  It was just his quirky practice!  Now I could watch A CHRISTMAS CAROL religiously every year and NOT experience any flashback disappointment.  And then when I saw O LUCKY MAN in the movies for the first time I couldn't wait to see myself stroll past Malcolm unless I ended on the cutting room floor!  But no, there he was coming up the alley looking unkempt and confused and there was I!  Where was I?  Hold on!  The passersby were all in soft focus, of course, with the main character being in sharp focus!  Alas, I didn't see myself - or if I did it was as a micro-second blur. Horsefeathers! Oh, well, I guess I wasn't such a ""lucky man"" in the largest sense of that phrase.  I didn't, like the hero of this movie, become a STAR out of sheer luck.  But guess what?  Once the film finally came out on this top-shelf DVD release I could finally freeze the frame and frame-by-frame see myself - or, rather, my coat and part of the back of my head - go by, crossing paths with the truly great actor Malcolm McDowell (who DOES have eyes like Steve McQueen!) yes,there was I on my first night roaming the streets of London! Precious memories - and a precious movie!  I just watched it again the other night and still don't know why this movie was ever made - but that is exactly the point of it all!  ""Don't ask why"" says the director to the film's hero when said hero is asked to smile and says there is nothing to smile about - and when pressed for a reason to smile the director (the actual director of this movie) says ""Dont ask why"" and that is pretty much for Life itself and it is even in the Greek Chorus threading this saga in the form of Alan ""Priceless"" Price and his band-mates for in the very title song we hear ""If you've found the reason to live on and not to die you are a lucky man,"" so that is why this strange classic cultish movie can jump about from one thing to the next, one emotion to the next, one picaresque adventure to the next and defy its being pigeon-holed into any sort of picture genre at all!  Sci-Fi, Comedy, Drama, Mystery, Horror, Romance:  all of these elements are so mixed within this movie that one can stand up and say ""Here was a movie!""  It means what it is.  It is what it means.  It....is.  That's all, folks!",1339718400,7,3955,4.246995994659546

This review is from: O Lucky Man! (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)

A young ambitious commoner made it up a success ladder and back to earth with life-threatening twists, being perhaps inspired with British-style tales of opportunities / hard-work-winners.

This work is contributed by classically performing the quite understandable subjects' realistic attitude to the environment screened, changed hardly eventually since the movie release in the seventies of the last century.

I just noticed on-face-likeness between young Malcolm McDowell and Andrey Mironov, then the S.U. heartthrob (The Diamond Arm), both working in the same timing.",1334448000,3,692,5.821782178217822

I watched the film in the 1980's on TV and when I had the chance to own a copy I had to have it, I found it as good now as when I first saw it and would recommend this to those whom like odd British films (IF, Britannia Hospital, A Clockwork Orange, Sir Henry of Rawlingson End, The Bedsitting Room, The Knack...and how to get it) as it will not disapoint.

Now I'm no director but I found it a touch too long, tried a little to hard to be eccentric and the musical links by Alan Price a bit dated but still a wonderfull odd, strange and dark film.",1300060800,2,684,4.135338345864661

sly political and social satire, and jammed with wildly brave
film-making choices, along with one of the great movie song-scores of

Its Candide meets 1970s Great Britan as a young man rambles through
life in a series of absurd adventures, with the great supporting cast
(Ralph Richardson, Helen Mirren, etc.) having the time of their lives
playing multiple roles.

The three hour running time may sound daunting, but it flies by as we
watch our hero Mick Travis (Malcolm McDowell, whose real life
pre-acting experiences were the jumping off point for the story) slowly
become wise to the ways of the world through a series of bizarre
encounters, arrests, love affairs, odd medical experiments,
and everything else that could befall a young man on the road.

287806,4,6300269701,"I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and was anxious to see if my memories of this sprawling, would-be classic were accurate. I recalled it as being a kind of political road-trip through the Britain of that time with Malcolm McDowell playing a modern Candide.
McDowell plays Mick Travis, who armed with a charming smile, tries to claw his way to success. Travis is up for anything. He starts as a salesman, volunteers for a weird medical experiment, is arrested as a spy, becomes secretary to a sinister industrialist, goes to jail and ends up a movie star. Nothing seems to dent his gee-whiz optimism.
The classic British cast features amazing actors like Ralph Richardson and Arthur Lowe and the young and amazingly beautiful Helen Mirren among others. I should say here that the best thing about this movie is the amazing music by Alan Price whose tuneful, insightful and witty songs both hold things together, provide commentary on the action and stand up incredibly well more than 35 years later.
There are also moments that seem to reverberate more now than they did at the time, for example the wacky scientist making bold predictions some of which have come true. But the left-wing political message is obvious and heavy-handed.
Bottom line, this three-hour story is always interesting but the message never quite comes together and it ends up being somehow less than the sum of its parts.",1229731200,5,1408,4.822314049586777
287827,5,6300269701,"This movie really gives you something to ponder, exploring through many funny, only half-absurd vignettes, the place of man in the world and how to respond to the suffering, cruelty and absurdity that exist.  An absurd movie parodying an absurd world?  At once timeless and fresh, the issues, many of which reflect the time period (honey, anyone?) are still essentially issues of any age perhaps, though there is a prophetic bent to the film which shows how dead-on the writers were with regard to what people will value and see as the promise of the future (the professor and his mad genetics) even while being set amidst the whole 'hippy'/post-hippy scene of the early 70s.

I've heard the film described as nihilistic though I didn't see it that way.  I'm glad there were subtitles as this brought the radio programs into clarity and they often added meaningful sub-text to the film (i love the broadcast about zen and the practice of zazen before he's arrested for spying).  But this film has nothing if not philisophical/spiritual undertones.  For a long time I was wondering where in fact the movie was trying to go, what it was trying to say if anything.  Beyond being funny - I don't need a message to enjoy a film, though this film surely had one.  And that of course is apparent in the end.  I enjoyed this marathon film, both for the excellent acting and funny scenes as well as for its deeper content which is never blatant, but almost challenging you to find.  The music of course pushes it right over the top and is a crucial ingredient.  Smile says the director (smack!), and you don't need a reason!

The bonus documentary interviews on Malcolm's career is also very interesting and kind of ties in well with O Lucky Man.  It gives you a feeling of Malcolm McDowell outside his roles on film.  Altogether this package is pretty good value for money.",1223078400,6,1865,4.663608562691132
287828,5,6300269701,"I saw the original release in 1973, and was blown away by it's unique style. The bizarre events surrounding a young, ambitious coffee salesman were at once fascinating and profound. It was my introduction to both Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren... both made an impression on me. And other things in the movie stayed with me over the 35 years between viewings, including some of the lyrics of the songs: ""If you have a friend on whom you think you can rely, you are a lucky man."" and ""Sell, sell, sell, everything you stand for.""
I was 23 at the time, and a month after seeing this movie I started a new job in direct sales. On the first day I attended a meeting with the new hires and all the current salesmen for the introduction of a new product. As I entered the boardroom and looked around at the melange of faces, ages, and sizes, I remember saying to myself, ""Oh my God, this is 'O Lucky Man'"".
In 1973 Time Magazine listed it as one of its top 10 movies of the year (but the Oscar went to ""The Godfather""). I tried to find the VHS or DVD for years, and finally saw it was to be released in October 2007. I put it in my Blockbuster queue right away. But even in July 2008 Blockbuster still had it listed as ""long wait"" and kept sending me the next movie in my queue. After too long a time of having it skipped over, I bought it from Amazon. I should have bought several more copies and sent them to Blockbuster!

287829,5,6300269701,"I just saw this movie for the first time, and for me this film in its substance and style but above all in its message is very reminiscent of the works of Antonioni, in specific ""Il deserto rosso"" and ""l'avventura"". An emotional string is woven through the movie, it's surrealistic, there are lots of hidden symbolisms etc. which in a mystical way add up to the overall hyperrealistic (through surrealism!), nihilistic message; a critical potrait of the social structure human kind created in modern times. Or in essence, the everybodies world we live in which we perceive in many different ways. This is done by Anderson with a very distinctive English twist which makes this movie extra special. I don't know any Anglo-Saxon movie which can compete on the above mentioned traits with this one. Very good and a joy to watch.",1215302400,5,825,4.816901408450704

I consider it one ofthe best Malcolm McDovell movie, along with the ""Clockwork orange"", even better, because he starts as a ""nice young man"", not a violant hoodlam.  With the score by Alan Parker of Animals, it's also a rock classic.
Also, although it's surreal, but not David Lynch surreal, but more like real life is surreal.

Now, some 34 years on, as I view it, I'm amazed at its prophetic nature. The packaging and extras help a lot to fill in the gaps: they make clear the epic and the metaphorical nature of the story, and hence intellectually help me grasp why the film rings so true.

Curiously, I don't remember the sequence where Mick attempts to rescue the woman in the flat, and it is indeed a flat sequence which, along with getting rumbled by the tramps, so reminiscent of the treatment little Alex gets at about the same part of A Clockwork Orange, could well be deleted: the film is extraordinarily long, anyway.

It is the continuing adventures of Micheal Travis, Esquire (Malcolm MCDowell); and this time along for the ride are Alan Price, Sir Ralph Richardson and an incredibly voluptuous Helen Mirren.

To be brief, this movie has 3 things which make it one of my all time favorites:
1. the music of Alan Price
2. unexpected comedy and anarchy
3. subversion
These three ingredients can and will not be found in any other movie with this kind of style. Thanks to Lindsey Anderson for that. He may not be the best British director of all time, but he certainly is the most subversive.
About the double DVD's:
not great but not bad, I don't understand why they had to split the movie between 2 discs. Also, the subtitles are sloppy. But the sound and the picture and the aspect ratio are just fine.
This DVD is highly recommended for the curious cinephile.",1194307200,4,934,4.559523809523809
287867,5,6300269701,"I think the consensus on this film pretty much says it all.  Ten reviews(including mine) and all are 5 stars.  This film is just a joy to behold.  Though it shares a director(Lindsay Anderson), a scriptwriter(David Sherwin), and a main character who incidentally share the same name as ""If..."", ""O Lucky Man!"" is a different animal than that dark comic masterpiece.  For sure there are elements of dark humor in ""O Lucky Man!"" but Anderson demonstrates a gentle touch here.  Anderson tackles a number of topics of social import that were relevant in their day but lose no power today.  The story offers a number of twists and surprises that a dare not ruin it for the uninitiated.  At a little less than three hours the film just breezes along unlike a lot of movies at half the length.  I daresay that this IS Malcolm McDowell's best work because the demands of the story require his character, an ambitious but naive coffee salesman, to go through a number of changes and McDowell hits a bullseye at every turn.  I also liked a young Helen Mirren's work as a slumming heiress that McDowell's Mick Travis encounters from time to time in his travels.  Lastly, what makes this film indispensible is the song score by former-Animal keyboardist Alan Price that acts as a greek chorus to the action on film.  I would rank Price's work with Simon and Garfunkel's in ""The Graduate"". I imagine a great triple-bill with this film, the aforementioned ""If..."", and Peter Medak's ""The Ruling Class"".",1194134400,3,1488,4.750972762645914

I first saw this film when I was 15, at a second run theatre. I loved it so much I dragged my 11-year-old niece in to see it again. (Obviously the staff were a little lax about the R rating.) I remember being intrigued, amused, and entertained, though I didn't understand the social commentary for many years. I immediately went out and bought the soundtrack, and it sounds as great - and relevant - today as it did all those years ago. As a student of improv now, I'm looking forward to a new appreciation of the ""threads"" of the story coming together as well.

287869,5,6300269701,"Let me join in here on the five star reviews.  The people on this thread who love this film are not delusional or overrating this film.  This is one of the greatest British films ever made, a truly unique experience in cinema.  It is a long movie (roughly 3 hours), but the film is never boring.  It is like a great novel, encompassing everything and still drawing you into Mick Travis's experience.  There is so much to enjoy here, from Malcolm's excellent lead performance (his 2nd greatest behind A Clockwork Orange), the performances of some of the greatest British actors ever (in multiple roles, nonetheless).  The list is astounding.  We have Helen Mirren, Ralph Richardson, Arthur Lowe, Rachel Roberts, and Peter Jeffries, for starters.  Warren Clarke, who played Dim in A Clockwork Orange, also appears as a valet and as a chaueffeur.  Geoffrey Palmer (probably best known as the lead in the BBC series As Time Goes By) also shows up.  The film is quite a journey, and it's one of those film experiences that will always remain with you.

And, the soundtrack.  What a soundtrack!  Alan Price (former keyboardist from The Animals) gives us here one of the greatest soundtracks in movie history, with some of the most poignant, funny, sardonic, and sad lyrics ever written for a film.  It deserves special mention.  Price also plays himself in the film (sort of), and he's great.  The final song, O Lucky Man, is absolutely wonderful and the highlight of the soundtrack.

Anderson's direction is superb, as he keeps the film flowing so well, and draws brilliant performances from one of the greatest casts ever assembled.  This is a truly great film, one that deserved every accolade and star it ever got (or will get)....",1193788800,9,1729,4.8231292517006805
287870,5,6300269701,"Finally, I hold in my hands The Two Discs Special Edition ""O lucky Man!""(1973), one of my most beloved movies ever released by Warner Bros. Pictures. It took 34 years for the second, and IMO, the best chapter in Lindsay Anderson's Mick Travis trilogy to receive the DVD transfer, and to become available for the happy fans all over the world. Called by Leonard Maltin, ""a memorable screen experience"", it is for me an unforgettable experience, the movie that I first saw on the big screen thirty years ago in Moscow and since that time, it has became a constant source of joy, the example of inspiring, brilliant moviemaking, the movie which I would watch over and over and never would get tired of or bored with. Brilliant performances, interesting twisted story that was in part inspired by Malcolm McDowell's own experience as a young coffee salesperson, and the great directing by Lindsay Anderson for whom, ""To make a film is to create a world"", made the film an instant classic and the cult favorite. The last but not the least are Alan Price and his band that provide the music commentaries to the Mick Travis adventures in the traditions of a Greek Chorus or Brecht's Theater.  Each song, every note and each word feel so perfectly simple and so joyously cool that  once you hear then, you won't forget them.

***Warning***:
Keep in mind, three hours long movie is divided into two parts and recorded on two discs. If you plan to rent it from ""Netflix"" or ""Blockbuster on line"", make sure to include the bonus disk on your rental list.

The set contains the very welcomed bonus features - vintage featurette ""O lucky man!  Innovations in Entertainment"", theatrical trailer, and new feature-length career profile ""O Lucky Malcolm"" (2006) directed by Jan Harlan. I highly recommend this documentary. Malcolm McDowell is terrific in it - exuberant, witty, self-ironic and enormously charming. He shares with the viewers his memories about Lindsay Anderson whom he calls the best after war British director, and his mentor and best friend. Anderson propelled him to the stardom after their very first film, ""If..."". When Stanley Kubrick who was thinking about adapting Anthony Burgess' ultra-violent controversial anti-utopia ""A Clockwork Orange"" saw Malcolm in ""If..."" he said to his wife Christiane, ""that's it, this is Alex"". Long after ""A Clockwork Orange"" was made, Kubrick said, ""If Malcolm [McDowell] hadn't been available I probably wouldn't have made the film."" It is interesting that originally Kubrick considered casting Mick Jagger as Alex de Large and the rest of Rolling Stones as his ""droogs"".

McDowell recalls his first American movie, Time After Time (1979). In the Time Travel Romance, he plays one of very few ""good guys"" of his career, H.G. Wells who not only wrote about a time machine, but actually created a working model. Wells runs after Jack the Ripper (David Warner) as far as the 1970s and meets the young modern woman Mary Steenburgen) with whom he fells in love. McDowell and Steenburgen fell for each other in the real life, married and had two children. The marriage lasted for ten years but both actors are steel good friends. Steenburgen and the couple's  two children,  Lilly, the actress, and Charley, the producer/director, all participated in the  documentary and found many good words for Malcolm. After watching the documentary, I have added three McDowell's films to my rental queue, ""Time After Time"", ""Gangster  #1""(2000) which the actor claims his best work since ""A Clockwork Orange"" and  ""Evilenko"" (2004) which is based on the true story of Andrei Cikatilo, the worst  Russian serial killer, nicknamed the Butcher of Rostov and 'The Red Ripper.' He was convicted of the murder of 52 women and children in the Russian Soviet Republic between 1978 and 1990.",1193616000,7,3807,4.977952755905512

I, for one, was hoping for the missing footage from the version said to have been shown at the Cannes Festival, where the film reputedly ran 3 hours and 20 minutes. Warners originally released the film in theaters in the US with a reel toward the end (and one of Price's songs) excised but restored the film to its 3-hour running time when it released the VHS edition. What happened to the missing 20 minutes from the Cannes version? Perhaps the mystery will be solved in Malcolm's commentary. By the way, it appears we have Malcolm to thank for pressuring Warners to put the film on DVD (though I would have prefered Criterion had taken it on). Many of the other principles having died, he was approached to do a commentary track for the new DVD and HD-DVD editions of ""Clockwork Orange"" and said he'd do that if he could do a commentary track on ""O Lucky Man!""

One of my favorite aspects of the film is Alan Price's soundtrack.  The songs (which relate very well to the action in the movie) are not only played in a studio by the Alan Price combo throughout the story, the band is actually part of the plot!!  The director's cameo at the end of the film is one of the most clever in the history of cinema.  And I would be very remiss if I did not mention the extremely lovely Helen Mirren in one of her early film roles.

287897,5,6300269701,"This is simply one of my favorite films. It is unique, and yet to watch it is to see something that was very typical of films in the early 1970's - film trying to reflect in some way upon the world as it exists or is heading. Then came CGI and the cartoonish escapist fantasies that comprise the vast number of films we have today. This film really requires multiple viewings to get it, and that is why I am so glad it is finally coming out on DVD. It basically follows the moral journey of an initially smiling coffee salesman (Malcolm McDowell) as he has his ideals smashed one by one. McDowell was himself a coffee salesman as a young man, and the whole film is from an original idea and script of his very own. I think it does a perfect job of describing the 1970's, which was basically a bridge decade between the idealistic 1960's and the ""If it doesn't contribute to the bottom line then it's expendable"" mode of thinking that began in the 1980's and just gets more entrenched as time passes. This film isn't for everyone, and although the two movies have completely different storylines, I'd say if you liked ""Harold and Maude"" you'll like this one too. The following are the extra features on the film as described by a press release from Warner Home Video.

287901,5,6300269701,"""Everyone is going through changes - No one knows what's going on. -And everybody changes places-But the world still carries on."" (Alan Price)

""O Lucky Man!"" (1973), directed by Lindsay Anderson (with Ralph Richardson, Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren) is a constant source of joy when I watch it again and again. Off I go with Mick Travis (McDowell) in his crazy surreal journey up and down, back and forth, ""around the world in circles"" along with the Alan Price's band that provide the music commentaries in the traditions of a Greek Chorus or Brecht's Theater (whichever you prefer). And in the end we find themselves in.... Well, can't tell you. You have to find out for yourself.

I saw it again recently, and it still stands as one of my favorite films. This time, though, I noticed that it was much darker than I remember. The good things and the bad things happen to our hero, Mick Travis, and I think that he really changed - he started to think more and smile less. The look on his face in the end of the move after asked to smile was not that charming, winning smile that he had in the beginning. It was pain, confusion, and anger.

Wonderful film - I am never tired of it. Even though, I know all the turns on the Mick's way to the top and back, it is still so interesting to watch him. I believe it was best McDowell's performance. I know that his most famous one was in Kubrick's Clockwork Orange but my favorite is the everyman Mick Travis who just wanted to succeed.

Young Helen Mirren was lovely as Patricia who traveled in her own crazy circles; the rest of the cast did great job, each of them playing more than one character.

Alan Price - I love his songs to the film very much. Possibly the best use of a rock soundtrack in a film. I am a proud CD owner and I listen to it constantly in my car. It is short, unfortunately.(sigh)

""O Lucky Man!"" is one of the best unfairly forgotten films ever.

I remember when I saw it for the first time in the theater, I did not know anything about it - I just liked the title. The girl who was next in line to the box office said to me, ""You will like it - it is a very cool movie, I saw it already."" Where ever she is today - I want to thank her.",1154390400,9,2211,4.212765957446808
287902,5,6300269701,"No synopsis can adequately describe this movie. On the surface

it is modern take on Voltaire's Candide but with ten times the

dark humour, bitter social satire and cynicism. I have seen that

movie when I was 16 and no other movie ever had equal effect on

me. It was liberating - like reading ""Breakfast of Champions"" or

""Slaughterhouse Five"" for the first time.",1128643200,20,366,4.65625
287903,5,6300269701,"I really love this movie, but only view it every few years, like a fine wine that is savored on special occasions. Every viewing evokes in me a sublime and bittersweet floodgate of angst and nostalgia that only someone who was young in the late 60s and early 70s could understand.

Other reviews have detailed the plot and themes in this sprawling, surrealistic allegory, so I'll just comment on a few themes and symbols not mentioned previously. The apple that is given to Mick seems to symbolize the Biblical ""fruit of the tree of knowledge"", which is used in the movie to great effect when he arrives at the medical center where gruesome genetic experiments are being conducted. Also, the genetic experiments seem to evoke Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, in which a compliant population is genetically engineered to love it's servitude. The shocking scene with a genetic ""freak"" shows a man's head on a sheep's body. The sheep is symbolic of one who unquestioningly follows authority and conforms to society.

I disagree with the reviewer who interprets the ending scene as Mick being ""literally beaten into smiling"". I beleive this is a reference to the Zen Buddhist practice in which a Zen master, suddenly and without warning, strikes a student with a rod to shock him out of illusory delusion, and into sudden enlightenment. The scene in which Mick is approaching the military base has him listening to a radio lecture on Zen, which would support this interpretation. The fact that Lindsey Anderson ""awakens"" Mick by striking him on the face with the very script of the movie itself, adds a cosmic ""mobius strip"" ending to the movie, and enlightens Mick into understanding that his true self is not to be confused with any of the roles he has played in the story, good or bad!

287904,5,6300269701,"I recently watched O Lucky Man again with a friend who was watching it for the first time, and I became accutely aware of the feelings I had when I first watched it.  It was an exhilarating and inspirational experience.  I envied my friend for a moment and then I got back to the picture...and I realized how much better this movie gets after repeated viewings.  Wow!
But as so many have said here in these reviews, a DVD release (Criterion are YOU listening??) packed with extras is sooooo overdue.  I've only ever seen this film on vhs and I'm salivating at the thought of seeing it on DVD...
It'll be like watching it for the first time...",1083369600,30,642,4.415254237288136
287905,5,6300269701,"Everytime I see pictures of the flemish painter Heironymous Bosch and then see Lindsey Anderson in this movie I think, gee he looks just like Bosch; kinda makes movies like Bosch paints as well.  His loosely connected Mick Travis trilogy: if.., O' Lucky Man and Britannia Hospital often look like the typical Bosch tryptich, in which the left panel shows man's expulsion from a distorted forboding man's view of ""heaven""; in if..'s case a British authoritarian boarding school, while the right side of Bosch's tryptichs show the twisted tortuous hell that man merits from his sins on earth; in Britannia Hospital's case, an insane asylum diguised as a government run hospital where death is certain from the most disgustingly violent experiments and sponsered by bureaucratic sadists.  In the middle of these moralty paintings is the incendiary display of sins man commits.  And it is here that we often find the most engaging bits of Bosch's work where so much happens in an instant as viewing a painting, which, actually takes years to see it all.  O' Lucky Man is very much designed in this fashion even if it wasn't intentional.  We get elements from this movie that may never be fully realized again in film; a dismal prospect indeed.  Innovations actually abound with this revolutionary film.  We have it's soundrack and score composer not only effectively weigh commentary on the movie's long suffering but affably earnest protagonist Travis (played with astonishing exuberence and charm by Malcolm McDowell), but that the singer (Alan Price, formerly of the Animals) even interacts with him in the film.  As innovative and amusing as that technique was, the soundrack can still stand on it's own as one of the greatest and most relevant to a film plot ever written.  Tell anyone who goes on a job interview or for that matter, hates their job to listen to the world weary idiosyncratic bliss in the song Poor People, a song that sticks forever in the souls of those who loved this movie like honey melting on hot toast crumpets. All in all, a very touching ode to smiling down disaster.
Many may twitch at the seemingly overindulgent symbolism going on and the lengthy running time and disjointed feel of this epic.  They may also get confused by the hilarious running gag of the actors playing repeated roles.  I found it fun beyond a roll in the hay to catch when each player shows up again and again several times over then bust out in laughter when Travis actually recognizes the lusciously charming Helen Mirren groupie character Patricia who showed up in episodes before his stint in jail, then looking at her talent agency clerk character with puzzling bewilderment a few moments later as if he had no clue.  As Mick, Malcolm McDowell can come off as enthusiastic and gullible then believably struggle with frustration, cynicism, and finally dogged determination to be ""good"" then giving up only to be thwacked back into his trademark grin.  The writing is all over his vastly expressive face and makes this one of his most unforgettable portrayals, completly abscent is the casual sadism that has garnered him praise but unfortunate typecasting down the road.  This is a must see movie for fans of his villian work who want to see his range; simply brilliant work.
It is also a film that is astonishingly relevant to how capitalist societies still function.  We're often amazed at how we haven't changed much from our need to divest in our homeland to rape another for the needs of the selfish.  Granted the film is long and bitingly sardonic and perhaps that idealism causes a slower decay then Anderson might have imagined.  Still, many of the films relevant lines about dying like dogs, radio commentary on Zen and revolution being the opium of the intellectuals ring strong in the hearts of anyone who questions their own existence and worth in the world.  This seems to be the one true everyman type of film as surreal as it may be.  There is just something so satisfying in just hearing the characters walking, which sounds strikingly like marching.  And it happens almost everytime before our poor boy Travis gets a beating.  It is a movie that has to be seen and heard repeatedly. Defintely buy this film.  For anyone who cares, if you managed to tape the uncut British version of the film when it ran on some obscure cable stations back in the early 90s, you may have gold in your hands; the deleted 'My Home Town' suicide sequence is there.  Yes, like a Boscsh picture, there is so much to see in this gem and we are all the luckier for having it in our lives.",1082160000,14,4586,4.777215189873417

It has been available, all but briefly, and was one of the last LaserDisc pressings in 1998. The missing 'My Home Town' (storyline previously pointed out by fellow reviewer Harris Fogel of Philadelphia PA) is complete and intact as chapter 40 side 4 (yep, it's a LONG movie!).

287911,5,6300269701,"Like many other folks, I was profoundly moved by the film and music of O Lucky Man. Years later, when my wife finally saw the film I had talked about for so long, she offered the opinion that it was a little boys adolescent fantasy, and in retrospect, I think there is some truth in that.
I still think of it as an amazing bit of work, and was lucky enough to attend a seminar on it in Los Angeles, hosted by Lindsay Anderson and Malcom McDowell, in which we learned among other things that the song ""My Home Town"" had a sequence of someone attempting suicide, which Travis tries to stop by climbing a rain gutter and effect a rescue, only to have it tear away from the building at the last moment. Anderson discovered that even the original negative of the scene had been destroyed by Warners, who felt that film was too long, and ordered the cut. Anderson joked about the impact of a 3 minute scene on a movie that was already running at a ""leisurely pace"" and found a first generation print of the scene under his bed. That night was to be the first time the film was to be screened as it was intended. This was not to be, and although he hand carried a print of the scene to be spliced into the film for the night, somehow, it still never happened! Which led to a very funny, and pissed off director howling at Hollywood for it's classic ineptitude. I'm waiting for my VHS copy to arrive to see if the video release has the footage restored. I'm recalling this from memory, about 15 years ago.. so I hope I haven't made too serious a mistake here.
The music however is another matter. The integration of the Alan Price and his band into the film, the strength of the songwriting, made it one of my favorite albums. I've been searching for the Soundtrack on CD since the format was made public, but never found it. Till now! I was searching for something related to Alan Price, and there it was, a lovely reissue of the soundtrack on CD. Sound wise, this is an open and clean sounding reissue. The album always seemed to be mixed a bit on the low side, and this reissue allows the soundstage to emerge a bit more defined. Of course, since my LP has been played to death.. This is really a wonderful discovery.
Price is a funny musician, he has released albums that made him a bit of the darling of the upper class in the UK, and also lovely concept albums like ""Between Today and Yesterday,"" and a great live album ""Performing Price,"" none of which I've found on CD.
In contrast to former bandmate Eric Burdon, who followed a completely different career path, Price cut wonderful covers of songs like Randy Newman's ""Simon Smith and his Amazing Dancing Bear"" a far cry from his R&B roots.
I really love this album, and I agree with David Kinney in that this work stands on it's own even without the film. A side note is the updated liner notes by Malcolm McDowell, in which he says that he was amazed that this wasn't nominated for an Academy Award ... my thoughts exactly.
A trivia note, of which I only remember a bit.. was that there was a well known movie in the 80s, in which the main character, a woman (I keep thinking Lily Tomlin) has prominently displayed in her apartment, a copy of O Lucky Man. Maybe someone can remind us of the movie.. nice to know that other folks were listening to the album! Go ahead, buy this CD.. it's gonna stick to your ribs.",994982400,17,3365,4.334389857369255

After finding and exorcizing an old children's Bible from my childhood memories due to a spooky picture of the devil in it that my wicked sisters chased me around the house with... I thought I'd find that mystery horror movie with the ONE scene that scared the heck outta me for yrs.  You know, the one where a heavily breathing and suffering man is found alone in his hospital room... and upon pulling off the sheets he's got the body of a big fat pig!!!  UGH?!  What was that???

Turns out it wasn't a horror movie at all.  It was this... this, I don't know how to classify it!!!  It's an absurd odyssey!!  A journey of a coffee salesman (of all things) as he runs into one crazy adventure after another...

dirty cops, sleazy hotel managers, paranoid military, deranged medical experiments, double-crossing millionaires, random debutante, imprisonment, mob of homeless who beat the heck out of him etc etc...

The 3-hour length of this film is as absurd as the movie itself.  It's really a compilation of neverending little stories with all kinds of dark n kooky 1970s British humor that seems to test the innocence and good will of this young man... most of which I was howling at for a good 90 min... but on and on it goes with the crazy.  Loads of scenes that will take you back to A Clockwork Orange... I'm sure this was done on purpose as this came out a yr or two after.

But then I'm like, please end already, lol... way too long.  I had to watch it over a 3 day period, lol.  Malcolm McDowell is beyond awesome and I've loved him forever since A Clockwork Orange... but this was just nuts to make sense of.

I can't believe I thought this was a medical horror flick!  Though I will say that man/pig scene still gave me the creeps at my age!!!",1514419200,,1764,4.395061728395062
7807832,3,6300269701,"This overrated movie is absurdist humor and black comedy in a series of disconnected vignettes.  Each vignette is understandable, but the overall story is non-unified and disconcerting.  The songs are mediocre.  One scene in the first half of the movie is quite funny.  Much of the movie concentrates on greed, extreme poverty, cruelty, death, and soft pornography.  It is always a delight to watch Ralph Richardson's acting, and in this case he has two contrasting roles.  The movie satirizes capitalism and religion.  One can easily recognize Malcolm McDowell in scenes of this movie that closely resemble his scenes in A Clockwork Orange.",1513900800,,641,5.2254901960784315

Shockingly funny where one least expects it...McDowell proves to be pleasantly adaptable in a number of films, and this one is also a fine example of his talent.

7807834,5,6300269701,I have watched this at least 15 times over the years and get more and more out of it.  Excellent satire and commentary of society and its ills. It is also fun to see and recognize the same actors playing different parts throughout the film.,1502841600,,240,4.333333333333333
