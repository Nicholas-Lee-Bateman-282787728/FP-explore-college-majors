1216141,1,B00000G3AW,"I had checked this out of the library for my nephew.  I thought that it would be like the other Walt Disney World Sing Alongs,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disney-s-Sing-Along-Songs-Beach-Party-at-Walt-Disney-World/dp/B0009X75WO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disney's Sing Along Songs - Beach Party at Walt Disney World</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sing-Along-Songs-Campout-at-Walt-Disney-World/dp/B0009X75XI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sing Along Songs - Campout at Walt Disney World</a>&nbsp;but I was wrong.  There were barely any glimpses of Disney characters, just Mickey and Minnie at the beginning and then an (annoying) animated Flick between the songs.

There were long pauses between the songs, which caused the movie to drag on.  And the songs...(Welcome to Harambe, On Safari, I Wanna Be Like You, You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby, Walk the Dinosaur, It's a Bug's World, Asia, He Lives in You, and Circle of Life)...there were a few that had to do with Disney, but I was disappointed.  Some tried to be cute and change the words to traditional Disney songs and the rest didn't seem to have much to do with Disney.  Maybe I'm just used to the old Sing Alongs, but it bothered me.

Kids who like animals a lot may like this DVD, because of the scenes between songs, but I think that if you are looking for a Disney Sing Along or footage of Walt Disney World there are better choices.",1187568000,2,1497,5.934883720930233
1216142,1,B00000G3AW,"Sadly this dvd was below what we have come to expect from the Sing A Long series. My 18 month old lost interest in this DVD after three minutes.

I can not believe that I paid for this DVD that comes across as a blatant commercial to see Animal Kingdom.... and Animal Kingdom is worst park in Disney World.",1185840000,,306,4.186440677966102
1216143,2,B00000G3AW,"This was really disappointing.  We have all the other live action Disney sing alongs, in preparation for taking our 4 year olds to Disney World in February, and this one was not up to par.  Fun at Disneyland is much better, as is Campout at Disney world.  I didn't mind hearing about the different animals, but as soon as they announced the contest among the children to photograph the most dangerous animal, I just had to roll my eyes and *sigh* -- I knew a lecture about human encroachment was coming.  Just in case anyone from Disney ever reads this -- I don't buy a Disney product for a sermon on environmentalism -- I can get that in the public schools.  I buy Disney videos so that my children can enjoy the magic of Disney.  They would have done better to stick with their established routine and not try to teach a lesson that any preschooler would have had to have been raised in a very dark cave not to have heard before.",1129507200,16,931,4.3526011560693645
1216144,5,B00000G3AW,"We have all the live action Sing Alongs and this one is my son's favorite. True, there are some breaks in the singing but we love hearing about the animals. Our VHS copy is about worn out and we were excited to see it released on DVD. If you have an animal lover then this is a good video.",1128297600,5,289,3.9152542372881354
1216145,2,B00000G3AW,"This sing along tape is pretty uninspired, and for the undemanding kid. Or for the Disney Sing Along Songs completist.

In this show hosted by Flik from A Bug's Life, you do get to see Disney's Animal Kingdom from Walt Disney World Florida, but the songs aren't really too impressive- either A Bug's Life or The Lion King related. Also, the words on screen seem to be a little delayed making it hard to sing along to.

If you want to get your kids started with Disney Sing Along Songs I'd recommend another one.

Suggestions: Friend Like Me from Aladdin, Zip A Dee Doo Dah from Song Of The South.",1125532800,12,596,4.4
1216185,1,B00000G3AW,Terrible. Mickey wasn't even in it. My kids hated it and so did I. Just a few bad cultural appropriations set to bad music.,1482969600,,123,4.166666666666667
1216186,2,B00000G3AW,not as good as the other ones my daughter loves so mucb,1479081600,,55,3.6666666666666665

1216189,5,B00000G3AW,"I had these Disney videos for my kids ,25-30 years ago , and they loved them, so I thought maybe my 1&1/2 year old grandson would enjoy them also. They didn't disappoint! Thanks Disney!",1472169600,2,185,4.470588235294118
1216190,2,B00000G3AW,"My 2 year old absolutely loves the other live action sing a longs (Disneyland fun and Campout) but this one is not up to par with the others! There is no seamless transition from song to song and not as ""fun"". Maybe older children will enjoy the facts and talking, but definitely not for toddlers. My daughter did love the animals in the safari song, but that was it. Save your money and order the other sing a longs.

UPDATE: We've owned this for a few months now and it has actually become one of my 2 year olds favorite sing a long dvds. I still personally like the others better but this one is the recent favorite for her.",1471305600,3,627,4.225

1216194,5,B00000G3AW,The video came a day earlier than I expected and it played through perfectly.  Watching this again brought back so many great memories from my childhood.  This was one of my favorite Disney Sing Along videos growing up.  So glad I found it here.,1459209600,,245,4.5227272727272725

1216198,5,B00000G3AW,Jambo! My 2 yr olds favorite DVD! He loves the songs and dancing and we catch him dancing along. We got this DVD in preparation of our upcoming trip to Disney World. This particular sing along song DVD is an excellent one. It's educational and better than most other sing a long DVDs. Highly recommend this one! You will even learn a little Swahili!,1441411200,3,349,4.46875
1216199,3,B00000G3AW,"As a big fan of the Disney Sing Along Song/Disneyland Fun I was very disappointed in this dvd!  It was cheesy and featured more of the children than the characters.  My grandson likes it okay, but if you're looking for something like the Disneyland one don't get this!",1439856000,,268,4.5625

I am in another country and I am very sad because I bought four DVDs for my baby and know thay all are useless. I think you must give this information before sell the product.",1433116800,,326,3.8088235294117645

1216237,3,B00000G3AW,My toddler doesn't watch this one as often as the other Disney sing along videos. There's more dialogue and the songs aren't as good. She likes Mickey and Minnie and they aren't on this one much.,1407456000,,195,4.444444444444445

1216240,3,B00000G3AW,Keeping mind it's vey dated but my grandson loves it and that's all that matters.  It isn't very  short but just a fun little ditty to watch.  It's nice to have these and he asks me daily to watch this particular one.,1401062400,,217,4.119047619047619
1216241,5,B00000G3AW,"These sing-along videos are so cute. My daughter is interested in them depending on her mood. I wish they weren't so short. But, hey, that's just how things were back then. Love it!",1391990400,,181,4.515151515151516
1216242,1,B00000G3AW,"Ugh...wish I could return this dvd.  My almost 3 year old LOVES the other sing-along dvd's we own (Campout, Beach Party, Disney Land) so I was happy that Santa decided to add this one to her collection.  She was super excited for us to watch it...she watched less than 1/3 of it before she lost interest.  I was disappointed as well, as this did not live up to my expectations compared to the other 3 sing-alongs we have.  Many of the songs are boring or not familiar, there is too much time between songs which makes it boring, the kids are barely featured and the scenes shift so frequently during the songs that I felt dizzy and nauseated after watching it.  During one 2 minute song, the scene changed 37 times (that I could count)...barely enough time for your brain to register one scene before it quickly switches to the next.  We will not be watching this one again.",1387929600,,874,4.465408805031447
1216243,5,B00000G3AW,"I chose this sing along because it reminded me of the many trips to Disney we have taken, and hope to take our grandchildren.  This by far was my favorite",1387238400,,154,4.133333333333334
1216244,3,B00000G3AW,"Bought for younger children. hey liked it because it was a Mickey thing but, did prefer some of his other DVDs better.",1372636800,,118,4.409090909090909
1216274,4,B00000G3AW,"This is another great Disney Sing Along.  My boys love it.  I was a bit suprised to find that Mickey is not really in the film at all, especially since he is so prominent in the cover graphic.",1368748800,,192,4.026315789473684
1216275,4,B00000G3AW,Bought this as a birthday gift for our soon to be 4 year old granddaughter.  Hopefully it will help her get ready for our trip to Disney later this year!!,1366934400,,154,4.133333333333334
1216276,2,B00000G3AW,"This Sing Along Songs video did not live up to the other Disney World-based ones (Fun at Disneyland, Beach Party, Camp). My daughter didn't even really look at the screen. Was hoping it would be good since it was newer than the others. Definitely not impressed.",1363132800,,261,4.695652173913044
1216277,5,B00000G3AW,"My two year old daughter loves this, as well as the other Disney sing-a-longs.  Videos like this are difficult to find.  Thank you Disney!",1358899200,,138,4.708333333333333
1216278,5,B00000G3AW,The twin girls are not as crazy about this one as the others I've purchased & recently reviewed but they did enjoy it a couple of times & the  boys seems to enjoy the Safari adventure nature of it & wildlife viewpoint! Great item for boys!,1322438400,,239,4.195652173913044
1216279,4,B00000G3AW,"My 3 year old first saw this at around 26 months and still enjoys it. She LOVES animals and the Lion King (I let her watch LK 1 1/2), which is probably why. Even though some of the reviews on here were unfavorable, I just knew she would really like this one because of those two things. She also loves Mickey but was not bothered in the least that he isn't the star of this show, and she really likes the host Flik.

This video was filmed in The Animal Kingdom at the WDW Resort and features actual shows and attractions from that park. The scenes, characters and music are very good. It is more educational than just pure fun like the other Sing-Alongs since it touches on not only animals, but also African and Asian culture. The only part I don't like is ""I Wanna Be Like You."" The people dressed up as gorillas look REEEALLY strange... but it doesn't bother her, of course.

The songs are:
Welcome to Harambe
On Safari
I Wanna Be Like You (The Jungle Book)
You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby
Walk the Dinosaur (Was, Not Was)
It's a Bug's World (Based on It's a Small World)
Asia (Based on the Siamese Cat Song)
He Lives in You (The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride)
Circle of Life (The Lion King)",1307577600,12,1195,4.259911894273127
1216280,5,B00000G3AW,"I ordered this video for my 2 year old daughter, as she already had the Disneyland Fun one and watched it daily.  As a former Disney Cast Member, this video kinda made me want to cry because I miss Disney World so much!  This dvd is awesome and I think it will definitely be our new ""everyday"" video!",1284076800,,300,4.155172413793103
1216281,5,B00000G3AW,this movie gets viewed at least once a month by my son who owns almost every child movie you can think of. He likes this sing along and loves Disneyland fun. I as a child used to watch Disneyland fun and Disneyworld Beach party  daily. Sing Alongs are great because they get kids attention as soon as you put them on vs. a movie with a story. These Sing Alongs are also great for parents because its a movie you don't mind watching with your kids.,1282089600,,447,4.1976744186046515
1216282,4,B00000G3AW,My kids love it although they could have incorporated the characters into it more.  My daughter always asks where minnie is.  It is worth addint to the collection.,1246406400,,163,4.785714285714286
1216283,4,B00000G3AW,My younger kids always want to watch a sing-a-long but my older boy finds them endlessly boring.  This video has turned out to be a great compromise as it is not all cartoon and even has a few shots of dinosaurs.  The Animal Kingdom Park is all about conservation so I didn't find the mentions about what people can do to help save wildlife habitats at all out of place and actually is a good conversation starter about environmentalism with the younger kids.,1190073600,,459,4.518072289156627
