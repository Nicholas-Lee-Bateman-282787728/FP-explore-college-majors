2692316,2,B000KJTG88,"I am sorry but the selection had a lot of strange things that my kid was confused about.  The Inheritance had adults fighting and a scary field hand. Okay, for the first one but a little edgy.  Lassie's Pups was scary a little for with Jeff taking his bicycle in the night and then getting hurt and being all alone. More stressful but the kid was still a good kid.  Then comes The Transition and there is this mysterious psycho little kid who cries all of the time, grandpa is dead and they are at a funeral, little kids fighting, and at the end, the little kid runs away, has to sleep out doors and tries to drown himself in a lake.  And then Lassie is given away, totally unlike the first episode where Lassie picks its owner.  A horrible collection for little kids younger than 6.  Definitely not a group of episodes that were meant to be shown together.",1309651200,,857,4.325
2692317,5,B000KJTG88,"After so many years of not seeing these original Lassie TV shows, it was a joy to revisit a simpler time in TV and life. I have wonderful childhood memories of watching Lassie every Sunday night with popcorn. Life was never so beautiful. The DVD quality is wonderful and the shows included classic Lassie. Thank you to whoever copied these early films on disk.",1309132800,3,360,4.640625
2692318,5,B000KJTG88,"They've started to show reruns of this classic TV show on a low watt TV station here, so I decided to buy this...great investment! Of any show that brings back sweet memories of my youth...this is it. From the opening credits with the great music..this shows America in a simplier time...one of hand cranked telephones..4-H....a slower life. I had never seen any of these episodes before..from the pilot(1st show) to the one that explains Gramps death & the introduction of Timmy. How I long for certain aspects of that era. If you grew up as a boomer..this might help you to relive the better aspects of that time..it did for me. I just wish they'd release the whole series.",1305072000,5,675,4.680672268907563
2692319,5,B000KJTG88,"I used to think it was my age when I first saw the Lassie episodes starring Tommy Rettig that made me prefer them, but it's not that; these are just better.  No disrespect to John Provost, et.al., but Tommy Rettig was an older, more experienced, and better actor.  Also, Jan Clayton made a most attractive young widow while George Cleveland was perfectly cast as the friendly but sometimes gruff gramps that every kid wanted to have.  (Both were accomplished ""B movie"" actors--watch for them on TCM.) Lassie, of course, was basically the ""man"" of the family despite her name.  These episodes, wonderful in black and white, were just more realistic with Jeff (Rettig) a typical rambunctious boy with a slightly stocky friend (Porky!) who got into situations where Lassie was a help, but not a supernatural savior.

This is a good selection of shows, although they definitely should have added one more regular show where Lassie's not arriving, leaving Jeff, or having puppies.  More Matt Brockway (Porky's cranky dad) would have been nice, too.  These earlier shows were just more believable to me, both then and now.  One warning: you may want to hold off viewing ""The Transition"" show until after watching more of the Rettig episodes.  Frankly, I never felt the same about that dog after she dumped Jeff for Timmy after three and a half years of devoted companionship.  Faithful dog--ha!  One other note, I always preferred the theme music and beautiful pastoral opening and closing scenes in these episodes to the shrill whistling and Lassie portraiture of the Timmy shows.",1279670400,5,1575,4.9505703422053235
2692320,5,B000KJTG88,All of the episodes need to come out.  The DVD quality was very good as were the episodes contained.  I just wish there'd be more of Jeff's Collie released to DVD.  I watched this over a decade ago on Nickelodeon & then found it to enjoy again on Animal Planet the cable channel.  Go to TVShowsOnDVD to cast your vote for MORE of the original Lassie with Tommy Rettig.  I am quickly engrossed in the stories of the Millers on the farm.,1229558400,10,435,4.2560975609756095
2692321,4,B000KJTG88,"We first saw the Jeff's Collie Lassie series in late 1959 on ABQ channel 2 from Brisbane. The picture and sound quality from the original film was superb on our then Philips Magnalux TV.....so after all those years playing the DVD and displaying it on our Samsung LCD (we now live in Java Indonesia), the results technically were a little dissapointing. Picture quality even though it is NTSC on this DVD is ""muddy"" and the sound has not been corrected. There is an annoying audio ""hum""! Surely there'd be plenty of good film copies around as this first Lassie TV series shot originally on 35 mm film was distributed to TV stations all over the world....and the audio could quite easily be restored before the film transfer is made. So how about it? Please do transfer other episodes of this Historic Series to DVD....and surely you can fit in excess of 3 episodes onto a double layer DVD?
Tommy Rettig....already was an experienced actor in major films...he'd appeared with Marilyn Monroe in ""River of No Return"" and before he died in 1996 Tommy was a pioneer of computer programming.
Lassie.....we had quite a chuckle in one of those 3 episodes to see several puppies ""planted"" on ""Lassie"" knowing full well ""she was a he""...but we believed it all back then and still enjoy the series today.  I'll be looking around for further classic series on DVD.....Sunset Strip will be one....but please if there's more to come of this first Lassie Series ""Just Holler""! It will then delight a whole new generation!!!

2692322,5,B000KJTG88,"This DVD contains an early episode of the 1954 series starring Tommy Rettig, where Lassie is awarded to the boy after a relative dies.  It also contains the transition episode aired in 1957 where an aging Rettig is replaced with tiny Jon Provost.  Gramps has died, Ellen decides to move herself and her son to Capital City to teach music, and lease the farm to the Martins, who have adopted a little orphan boy.  The dog decides what she wants to do in this episode as she does in the first episode.  The actors in the first post-transitional season who play Timmy's parents are abruptly replaced without explanation.  For those who remember this series from their early baby boomer years, the DVD brings back memories.  Solid American virtue is everywhere to be found.",1197504000,11,769,4.7443609022556394
2692323,3,B000KJTG88,"The Tommy Rettig ""Lassie"" delighted me tremendously as a young boy, and I love seeing these shows after 50 years. I recalled a sense of true, non-Hollywood-gloss reality about the way the farm looked, the way Jeff's mother (Jan Clayton) looked and spoke, and the way Jeff reacted like a real.

That's all here in this CD, but because the three shows are untypical -- Jeff gets Lassie, Jeff loses the farm, and a show where Lassie, sick, just lies down for 25 minutes, I don't feel the life of the farm and of being young and adventurous, the way the series moved me every usually Sunday night.

So, this a nice package. But I wish we could have more of the regular drama of a great kid, a great life, and a great dog.",1191196800,20,717,4.303703703703704

8157492,3,B000KJTG88,"Not bad. It brings back kid memories in the late 50's and early 60's. Dumb Timmy came later after Jeff played the role here. Jeff's mom, in the show, was in a few Hopalong Cassidy movies back in the  40's. Gramps and mom are fun as well as Lassie. Jeff is not as stupid as Timmy, who took his place in the later episodes with mother June . Very good show for young kids.",1454198400,,370,4.0

The newer Lassie shows were really boring and Timmy was such an annoying brat. Why not release all The Jeffs Collie DVD
