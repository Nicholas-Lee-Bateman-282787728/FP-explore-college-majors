5046283,4,B0070EUHMU,"I saw this movie in Australia a couple years ago at a film festival. From what I remember it had action and suspense. An obsessed maniac seeks out this chick and kills anyone that stands in his way. Her friends try to protect her from the carnage, but soon stuff happens (not spoiling things). The two detectives assigned to find and retrieve the killer have only that night to capture him and make sure he doesn't harm or kidnap the girl. The ending I remember had a twist I never saw coming, which makes the film worth watching till the end. It's a great story and recommend it. Plus it's an Aussie film with an American wrestler, what more to like.",1337817600,7,651,4.3884297520661155

5046302,1,B0070EUHMU,"Very bad movie. The acting was very bad, amateurish, and not believable. The characters portrayed seemed very stupid in their reaction to the perilous situations they faced throughout the movie. Even though there was suspense and action, the story line was bad, tedious, and at times frustrating to watch.",1472860800,2,305,5.244897959183674
5046303,1,B0070EUHMU,"This was so horrible, I could not FORCE myself to watch the whole thing!  The actors all look way too old to be in college, although I attended at a much older age.  Poor acting, if you want to call it that.  Just terrible.  I couldn't make myself watch more than 30 minutes and that was really forced!",1472774400,2,302,4.155172413793103

8507711,4,B0070EUHMU,"The acting wasn't that great, but it was a low budget film. There were also some unbelievable moments when showing the stupidity of the police, but I have seen much worse. What sets this movie apart is that the story was good and there was an excellent twist to the ending. Based on that I gave it a four. You may not like it, but if you look below the low budget pitfalls; you will see the work of a very talented writer showing through.",1485648000,,438,4.1647058823529415
