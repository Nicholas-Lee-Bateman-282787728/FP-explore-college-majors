8341760,5,B001TK2A44,One of my favorite music genre documentaries!,1412294400,,45,5.571428571428571
8341761,4,B001TK2A44,This film covers the underground heavy music scene very well. I can see many full features that could come from this film on the sub-genres portrayed in the film. Very well done.,1395446400,,178,4.59375
8341762,5,B001TK2A44,"Great documentary. Interesting look into the mindset of ""stoner"" and ""doom"" musicians. Worth watching regardless of what genre you are into.",1381968000,,140,5.714285714285714
8341763,5,B001TK2A44,"This documentary is necessary viewing for fans of doom. Great if you already know the story of Sleep, better if you don't. Learn about desert rock, San Francisco metal and even the illustrators who put a visual style to the riffs. Get this, don't fool around with Youtube's crappy sound.",1368576000,2,287,4.76
8341764,5,B001TK2A44,"Trust Wino! this is an amazing documentary, since I received this item I have watched it five times already, this document explains in a detailed way what stoner rock, doom , fuzz rock, sludge, drone etc. is about, what the genre stands for and the concept that it envolves, all of this explained in a very entertaining way by musicians such as Wino (of course), Scott Reeder (Kyuss) , Matt Pike (sleep, high on fire, kalas) members of Melvins , Comets on Fire, Nebulas Mark Abshire and Eddie Glass I ignore why Fu Manchu were ignored with the exception of an image showed of the ""in search of..."" album they don't get major credit here, but its a minor flaw due to the extense information provided in the entyre film, the document explores the scene during 70s, 80s, 90s and the current situation, also mention from the begginers Sabbath, Purple, Zep, Blue Cheer, Pentagram in a very special mention, Hawkwind (in the experimental aspect) to more recent exponents Kyuss, Monster Magnet, Saint Vitus, Wino as a solo artist, Sleep and of course his ramifications, High On Fire and the awseome Om, Sunn o))) and a large etcetera, perhaps the mention of bands from other locations on the globe would have expanded and improved a little more the documentary, but since the main idea was to explore the American underground scene and more particularly the scene in California we can say that the film is very comprehensive indeed, however the makers of this effort had the generosity to include in the extras a few more recommendations of bands and albums from other countries for a better understanding of the philosophy that this underground movement involves.

you must get this!

8341765,5,B001TK2A44,"This is one of the BEST musical genre documentaries in existence. It starts from the 1970's heavy rock explosion and covers every decade up until the creation of the documentary(2008). It name drops all sorts of amazing bands that never got well-know exposure: Captation Beyond, The Groundhogs, Buffalo, Stray, Dust, Hawkwind, Sir Lord Baltimore, Atomic Rooster... Then goes into the start of desert/stoner/doom bands with Pentagram, St Vitus, Sleep and Kyuss
Also they explain the importance of album cover artwork and basically the hardships that come along with being in a heavy rock band.
Covers other great bands such as: Acid King, High On Fire, OM, Dead Meadows, Sunn O))), The Obsessed, Comets on Fire, Brant Bjork, Melvins and many more bands.
This is the key to the future!
5/5 BUY this noooooowwww!!!!!",1304467200,6,813,5.120300751879699

8341767,5,B001TK2A44,"This is a must watch documentary for fans of desert rock or heavy music in general. It's very informative and covers several aspects of the genre from producers, to band members, to fans,  and album cover artists. Good Stuff indeed!!! I can't say enough good words about this dvd.",1269475200,,280,4.714285714285714
8341768,5,B001TK2A44,"Man this DVD is a real eye and ear opener to some great bands ive never heard before. Thanks to this DVD i now proudly own some wicked Dead Meadow cd's, Earthless, OM and Fatso Jetson. It was cool to see ex Kyuss dudes Brant & Scott talk about the good old desert generator parties. Overall a highly entertaining and imformative DVD about the underground rock scene in America. This DVD proves how much the majority of radio music really does suck. Wino is hilarious!!!",1264982400,2,469,4.529411764705882
