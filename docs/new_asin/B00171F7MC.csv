3166747,2,B00171F7MC,"I've waited about three years for the third and fourth season of Quincy and a couple of other series as well. I then noticed everything I'm waiting on is realesed by universal.
Easy enough I will not buy any series anymore that universal comes out with till they release the whole series.
To me universal is the dell of the video world oh wait they might not be that bad but close.
Yes I do realize that I did not capitalize universal or dell becuase they do not deserve my time or effort in hitting the caps. LOL",1231372800,4,513,4.244897959183674

This is a show beloved by hundreds of thousands,  Universal, perhaps even millions, considering it was during the days of Limited Broadcast TV Choice.

PLUS, the show's demographic is in the 35-60 year old range.  You know, Universal, the folks with the $$$$$$$$$$$.

Wake up and be smart businesspeople.  Put the rest of the Quincy ME seasons out.

Yes, even the last one (how many seasons did Quince run - six?) , which was a bit korny...I STILL want to see it again, even if only to chuckle...",1228780800,,697,4.564516129032258
3166749,5,B00171F7MC,"I have all but given up waiting for my favorite show of all time, Quincy, to be released.  The way I figure it since Quincy is 20-30 years old people in their 60's and 70's now are Quincy's main fans.  If you don't release the dvd's now, if you wait too long the biggest quincy fans may be all gone!  So if money is the reason for release, then RELEASE THEM NOW WHILE IT WILL PAY.  Money talks - so maybe money will talk to the studio to release my all-time favorite show.  Apparently they don't care about the fans; maybe they will care about profits.",1224892800,5,552,4.169811320754717

I was thankful to finally get the first two seasons on DVD, but it's been three years since it was released.  While I have copies of my favorite episodes following season two until the end (from reruns), I prefer the uncut versions because they cut programs to bits to insert more commercials and ruin the storyline.

Release more Quincy.  Don't bother with the newer programs because they stink anyway.  You don't find quality in television these days which is why people want the classics.",1223424000,,589,4.735294117647059

3166881,5,B00171F7MC,We enjoy watching this old show.  I ordered more seasons since we still like to watch this show.  Jack Klugman was a versatile actor.,1374796800,,133,4.5
3166882,5,B00171F7MC,"Season Three of QUINCY saw the show come fully and finally into its own, and with wonderful results. It's the first truly ""full"" season of the show, and begins the overdue process of fleshing out the show's characters and taking more of the episodes off soundstages and backlots and actually exploiting Los Angeles as a location. Mostly, however, it's where Jack Klugman really comes into his own as Quincy, M.E. - crusty, hot-tempered, and always ready to throw down will all manner of evildoers, using not a gun but his brains and medical training to be, in essence, a one man CSI team.

The formula of QUINCY was pretty simple, yet very daring for its time. Quincy (the rusty-voiced Jack Klugman, a walking force of nature) is a medical examiner in Los Angeles County who lives on a houseboat and is never, ever content to leave well enough alone. Not only is he too nosy to let any suspicious death ever slip past his considerable nose, he's got a heart as big as all outdoors and is constantly battling his paper-pushing superior, Dr. Asten (John S. Ragin), and the ever-disbelieving Lt. Monahan (Garry Walberg) - essentially Agent Scully before there was an Agent Scully) to let him get to the bottom of (seemingly) accidental deaths, (seeming) suicides and (seeming) murders. At his side is the long suffering assistant Sam Fujiyama (Robert Ito), who has no social life thanks to Quincy, and Danny (Val Visoglio), the owner of Danny's Bar & Restaurant, who endures Quincy's endless jokes about the quality of his food. Arrayed against them are the best character actors the late 1970s/early 80s had to offer...veterans of such TV shows as BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, STAR TREK, M*A*S*H and so on.

As I said above, Season 3 is not only fleshier and more sure of itself than its predecessors, it's simply better in quality, period. It's also probably the first season that really embraced ""causes"" (immigration, race, problems in amateur sports, corporate greed, etc.) rather than ""mystery"" as its meat and drink...a fact of the show that made it unusual, even unique. Nearly all the episodes are good and quite a few of them are outstanding. A few of my faves:

""A Blow To The Head"" - Quincy butts heads with an old friend while investigating the death of a boxer (Joe Louis appears in a cameo).

""A Dead Man's Truth"" - Quince reconstructs what happened during a complex police shooting.

""Death Casts A Vote"" - An episode about California's immigration politics which is as timely today as when it was shot.

""Tissue of Truth"" - A race-against-time episode in which Quince has to locate a kidnapped boy who has been buried alive...after his kidnappers have been killed without revealing the location.

""Main Man"" - Quincy grapples with a ""football dad"" who seems willing to risk his son's life for the sake of winning the big game.

""The Hero Syndrome"" - A man claims (Peter ""Spider-Man"" Thorwall) claims responsibility for a murder Quincy thinks he didn't commit.

""Touch of Death"" - A martial arts movie star dies mysteriously, but his cousin - Sam - doesn't want the body autopsied because of the departed's Bhuddist beliefs.

""Passing"" - Quincy needs help from a forensics expert when trying to put a face on a skull he accidentally discovers in the desert.

""Requiem For The Living"" - A mobster who has been fatally poisoned kidnaps Quince and Sam and forces them to help him investigate his own murder.

(I'd like to add that one of the best -- not only of this season but of the entire series, is ""Tissue of Truth."" This episode is not only wickedly suspenseful and well-written, it has a lavish budget involving helicopters, aerial cinematography, and numerous exterior locations in the desert. The series truly came into its own in this story which could be torn right out of the CSI playbook -- except that QUINCY did it first.)

One thing that particularly pleased me about this season was that it started the process of exploring the supporting characters, who up to that point were simply cardboard cutouts. ""Touch of Death"" is Sam's not-just-a-sidekick moment, just as ""Double Death"" gives a much-overdue third dimension to the Asten character (who in subsequent seasons becomes one of the best things about QUINCY). But in truth, few shows ever revolved so totally around the personality of their lead actor as this one did. Klugman is one of those rare actors who is so charismatic and vital that anything he does, from complaining about the crappy coffee in the lab to running from hit-men, is equally compelling. His relish for life galvanizes his character, whose almost unbelievably bad temper and tendency to shout at the slightest provocation might otherwise have been a bit off-putting (now it's just funny).

It's true, of course, that the show often has a cheesy ""after-school special"" heavy handedness, what with its ""causes"" and warnings and moral messages and all. It's equally true that it is very dated, not just in the fashion and technology senses but in its rather nave outlook and its tendency to force happy endings on almost every story; but this too is part of its charm. And what the hell, you've gotta give Quince major propers for solving his cases without DNA, cell phones, the Internet, or even much in the way of computers. He's an old fashioned gumshoe detective, except that he wields a scalpel (and a hot temper) instead of a pistol and is about as gold-hearted as any character ever written for television. And you know what? In an age where ""moral ambiguity"" is almost a byword, that's all right by me. Quincy can perform my autopsy anytime.",1372723200,6,5591,4.828631138975966

3166899,5,B00171F7MC,"Campy and fun the way 70s and early 80s crime television can only be, Quincy M.E. remains one of my all-time favorite and re-watchable shows.  This is entirely due to the solid performance by Jack Klugman, who manages to find the serious and humorous in every episode.  A real treat to watch.",1358121600,,292,4.596153846153846
3166900,4,B00171F7MC,"Quincy was in a way the predecessor to shows like CSI and Law and Order SUV. The show was one of the first to feature actually forensic equipment that was used in the real world, and many of the first season episodes felt authentic. The show was originally apart of NBC mysteries movies, but proved popular enough to branch out of its own. ""The Thigh Bone's Connected to the Knee Bone"" was typical of one of the early episode where believable forensic investigate was used to reconstruct the remains of a football player. That show won an Emmy. The first few seasons were actually pretty convincing for their time, and for the most part hold up today, without having to resort to the gore of shows like CSI and Law and Order SUV.

However, as the show progressed the shows become preachier, and it was not uncommon for Quincy to get up on his soap box. Quincy in later seasons went beyond being a coroner and became a voice against pollution, corporate greed, and even Tourettes syndrome.

There is nothing wrong with this but it is not really the job of a coroner. Never-the-less, even these episodes were entertaining. Some of these episode have become camp classics like the infamous punk rock episode, where you had the feeling the writers had little grasp of the subject matter.

Still, I find Quincy far more entertaining than the dry CSI series, whose characters just don't really interest me. Even when Jack Klugman sometimes hams it up on the screen at least he is interesting to watch. He is an actor that brings genuine conviction to the screen.",1347494400,,1556,4.650909090909091

Some episodes I remember vividly have not yet appeared so I know there must be a couple more seasons.  This show beats ANY of the modern crime/medical dramas (except House, although Quincy surpasses House frequently in individual episodes, possibly even in total, would have to really analyze) so I can recommend it without hesitation, this is where the idea for pretty much any new crime/med show came from.  Buy it!",1295913600,,546,4.776595744680851

3166919,1,B00171F7MC,"With this program there were two types of shows.  The stiff shows, were there is actual who done it, and the soap box shows.  Starting with this season the soap box shows went from unwatchable to just plan (and excuse the up comming pun) insulting.  There are two classic examples of this.  The first is one were an airplane crashes during which after 30 mins and talking to one person Dr. Q become more of expert on how to design an aircraft than anyone at Boeing.  The second one is were Dr. Q proves that the Germans killed millions of Jews.  This is just insulting.  No one was sitting there helpless waiting for good old Dr. Q to come along.  Lets see we have millions of documents produced by the Germans stating on day to day tally how many Jews they killed with cost accounting, and hundreds of trials with qulity vedicts.  Not to mention 1,000s  of photos, witness statements, buildings ect, ect. ect.",1269820800,,910,4.4939024390243905

3166924,4,B00171F7MC,"Finally the third season has been released on DVD by Universal after a long wait. I've given the set four out of five stars because I had to have a replacement from Amazon. While most discs played fine discs 3 & 4 still had marks on the back of them, especially with disc 4, which had some parallel line marks on the back of it.

The episodes, whilst not digitally remastered (nothing unusual with Universal DVD boxsets), don't look that washed out.

The Season 1 and 2 set has been out for more than 2 years...I thought that Universal was going to leave us Quincy fans hanging and not come out with the rest of the series.

Quincy fans...if tradition with classic Universal TV shows holds, I would expect to see one season per year, releasing at about the same time as this one did.",1254268800,,450,4.232558139534884

3166947,5,B00171F7MC,"One of the best TV series ever made, period ! Jack Klugman is outstanding in this and his acting is on par with the great Spencer Tracy. It's wonderful to watch a classic series like this and see an actor of the calibre of Mr Klugman breath life and soul into the character. Perfect casting for the part, he made the character of Quincy his own, supported by an outstanding ensemble cast ! Now in his 80's, I recently wrote off to Jack for his autograph and received a signed photo back from the States in a few short weeks ! As I said, it's all in the casting, and like Quincy, Jack is a guy of integrity, warmth and humanity. Cheers Jack !",1252195200,7,641,4.17741935483871

3166949,5,B00171F7MC,I was amazed to learn that another season was legitimately released on DVD for purchase and we quickly purchased it.  The show stands the test of time and is superior to today's less child appropriate crime/drama shows - true family entertainment.  This season will not disappoint the Quincy fan ... my only question is when will Universal release the rest of the seasons?,1251849600,4,372,4.888888888888889

3166953,5,B00171F7MC,"I must say in terms of TV I doubt any actor has brought as much conviction to a role as Klugmans' Quincy. Understand, I have EVERY great TV DVD set released, All in the Family, Columbo, Star Trek.. etc any show that is considered A CLASSIC by any means or public forum.. aside from that and a few dodgy episodes here and there in Season 3, the performance of Quincy is just as good as it gets.. rarely do you hear or see YELLING at the tops of lungs in presenting a point of view on network TV. Was it acting? lol. When it's this convincing it becomes real. The go-rounds with Quincy and Astin are some of the finest moments in TV history.. please speed up the process for Season 4!",1246838400,3,682,4.174242424242424

It definitely set the standard for all of today's crime television shows (i.e. CSI, NCIS, Law Order:SVU,etc.)  I wish that all of the other seasons would be released in a timely manner.  OY, our group isn't getting any younger and those under my generation won't remember this wonderful classic!!!  Give me more Quincy, Perry Mason, and The Nanny....

I was mad that Wal-Marts and Targets in my area said that they weren't going to carry the Season 3 DVD.

So, if Universal sees lagging sales, they know who to thank...those who didn't carry the Season 3 DVD's!

There are alot of Quincy fans out there......it is no coincidence that it is one of the most popular TV shows in history...... and we love our Quincy DVD's, so please, release the remaining seasons of Quincy, M.E. as soon as possible!!

One idea for a ""Special Feature"" on a future DVD set:  Do a special interview with Jack Klugman and allow him to talk about the good old days when he was working on Quincy.
We would love that special feature, and we would love to hear his thoughts on Quincy, both at the time it was being filmed, and how he feels about the legacy of Quincy.

Before there was ""CSI"", ""Cold Case Files"" etc...there was Quincy, M.E.

The best show in the history of television.",1244678400,2,949,4.388571428571429

Those of us who grew up in the 70's know that long before there was Grissom, CSI or it's trillion spinoffs, there was Quincy.  Loosely based on (in)famous Los Angeles coroner Thomas Noguchi, Quincy is not content to remain in the confines of his laboratory.  He travels to crime scenes, confronts witnesses and suspects, questions police procedures and speaks out on sociological issues that affect both the living and the dead.

If you don't release the dvd's now, if you wait too long the biggest quincy fans may be all gone!  So if money is the reason for release, then RELEASE THEM NOW WHILE IT WILL PAY.

While I have copies of my favorite episodes following season two until the end (from reruns), I prefer the uncut versions because they cut programs to bits to insert more commercials and ruin the storyline.

3401378,5,B00171F7MC,We enjoy watching this old show.  I ordered more seasons since we still like to watch this show.  Jack Klugman was a versatile actor.,1374796800,,133,4.5
3401379,5,B00171F7MC,"Season Three of QUINCY saw the show come fully and finally into its own, and with wonderful results. It's the first truly ""full"" season of the show, and begins the overdue process of fleshing out the show's characters and taking more of the episodes off soundstages and backlots and actually exploiting Los Angeles as a location. Mostly, however, it's where Jack Klugman really comes into his own as Quincy, M.E. - crusty, hot-tempered, and always ready to throw down will all manner of evildoers, using not a gun but his brains and medical training to be, in essence, a one man CSI team.

The formula of QUINCY was pretty simple, yet very daring for its time. Quincy (the rusty-voiced Jack Klugman, a walking force of nature) is a medical examiner in Los Angeles County who lives on a houseboat and is never, ever content to leave well enough alone. Not only is he too nosy to let any suspicious death ever slip past his considerable nose, he's got a heart as big as all outdoors and is constantly battling his paper-pushing superior, Dr. Asten (John S. Ragin), and the ever-disbelieving Lt. Monahan (Garry Walberg) - essentially Agent Scully before there was an Agent Scully) to let him get to the bottom of (seemingly) accidental deaths, (seeming) suicides and (seeming) murders. At his side is the long suffering assistant Sam Fujiyama (Robert Ito), who has no social life thanks to Quincy, and Danny (Val Visoglio), the owner of Danny's Bar & Restaurant, who endures Quincy's endless jokes about the quality of his food. Arrayed against them are the best character actors the late 1970s/early 80s had to offer...veterans of such TV shows as BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, STAR TREK, M*A*S*H and so on.

As I said above, Season 3 is not only fleshier and more sure of itself than its predecessors, it's simply better in quality, period. It's also probably the first season that really embraced ""causes"" (immigration, race, problems in amateur sports, corporate greed, etc.) rather than ""mystery"" as its meat and drink...a fact of the show that made it unusual, even unique. Nearly all the episodes are good and quite a few of them are outstanding. A few of my faves:

""A Blow To The Head"" - Quincy butts heads with an old friend while investigating the death of a boxer (Joe Louis appears in a cameo).

""A Dead Man's Truth"" - Quince reconstructs what happened during a complex police shooting.

""Death Casts A Vote"" - An episode about California's immigration politics which is as timely today as when it was shot.

""Tissue of Truth"" - A race-against-time episode in which Quince has to locate a kidnapped boy who has been buried alive...after his kidnappers have been killed without revealing the location.

""Main Man"" - Quincy grapples with a ""football dad"" who seems willing to risk his son's life for the sake of winning the big game.

""The Hero Syndrome"" - A man claims (Peter ""Spider-Man"" Thorwall) claims responsibility for a murder Quincy thinks he didn't commit.

""Touch of Death"" - A martial arts movie star dies mysteriously, but his cousin - Sam - doesn't want the body autopsied because of the departed's Bhuddist beliefs.

""Passing"" - Quincy needs help from a forensics expert when trying to put a face on a skull he accidentally discovers in the desert.

""Requiem For The Living"" - A mobster who has been fatally poisoned kidnaps Quince and Sam and forces them to help him investigate his own murder.

(I'd like to add that one of the best -- not only of this season but of the entire series, is ""Tissue of Truth."" This episode is not only wickedly suspenseful and well-written, it has a lavish budget involving helicopters, aerial cinematography, and numerous exterior locations in the desert. The series truly came into its own in this story which could be torn right out of the CSI playbook -- except that QUINCY did it first.)

One thing that particularly pleased me about this season was that it started the process of exploring the supporting characters, who up to that point were simply cardboard cutouts. ""Touch of Death"" is Sam's not-just-a-sidekick moment, just as ""Double Death"" gives a much-overdue third dimension to the Asten character (who in subsequent seasons becomes one of the best things about QUINCY). But in truth, few shows ever revolved so totally around the personality of their lead actor as this one did. Klugman is one of those rare actors who is so charismatic and vital that anything he does, from complaining about the crappy coffee in the lab to running from hit-men, is equally compelling. His relish for life galvanizes his character, whose almost unbelievably bad temper and tendency to shout at the slightest provocation might otherwise have been a bit off-putting (now it's just funny).

It's true, of course, that the show often has a cheesy ""after-school special"" heavy handedness, what with its ""causes"" and warnings and moral messages and all. It's equally true that it is very dated, not just in the fashion and technology senses but in its rather nave outlook and its tendency to force happy endings on almost every story; but this too is part of its charm. And what the hell, you've gotta give Quince major propers for solving his cases without DNA, cell phones, the Internet, or even much in the way of computers. He's an old fashioned gumshoe detective, except that he wields a scalpel (and a hot temper) instead of a pistol and is about as gold-hearted as any character ever written for television. And you know what? In an age where ""moral ambiguity"" is almost a byword, that's all right by me. Quincy can perform my autopsy anytime.",1372723200,6,5591,4.828631138975966

3401396,5,B00171F7MC,"Campy and fun the way 70s and early 80s crime television can only be, Quincy M.E. remains one of my all-time favorite and re-watchable shows.  This is entirely due to the solid performance by Jack Klugman, who manages to find the serious and humorous in every episode.  A real treat to watch.",1358121600,,292,4.596153846153846
3401397,4,B00171F7MC,"Quincy was in a way the predecessor to shows like CSI and Law and Order SUV. The show was one of the first to feature actually forensic equipment that was used in the real world, and many of the first season episodes felt authentic. The show was originally apart of NBC mysteries movies, but proved popular enough to branch out of its own. ""The Thigh Bone's Connected to the Knee Bone"" was typical of one of the early episode where believable forensic investigate was used to reconstruct the remains of a football player. That show won an Emmy. The first few seasons were actually pretty convincing for their time, and for the most part hold up today, without having to resort to the gore of shows like CSI and Law and Order SUV.

However, as the show progressed the shows become preachier, and it was not uncommon for Quincy to get up on his soap box. Quincy in later seasons went beyond being a coroner and became a voice against pollution, corporate greed, and even Tourettes syndrome.

There is nothing wrong with this but it is not really the job of a coroner. Never-the-less, even these episodes were entertaining. Some of these episode have become camp classics like the infamous punk rock episode, where you had the feeling the writers had little grasp of the subject matter.

Still, I find Quincy far more entertaining than the dry CSI series, whose characters just don't really interest me. Even when Jack Klugman sometimes hams it up on the screen at least he is interesting to watch. He is an actor that brings genuine conviction to the screen.",1347494400,,1556,4.650909090909091

Starting with this season the soap box shows went from unwatchable to just plan (and excuse the up comming pun) insulting.  There are two classic examples of this.  The first is one were an airplane crashes during which after 30 mins and talking to one person Dr. Q become more of expert on how to design an aircraft than anyone at Boeing.  The second one is were Dr. Q proves that the Germans killed millions of Jews.  This is just insulting.  No one was sitting there helpless waiting for good old Dr. Q to come along.

One idea for a ""Special Feature"" on a future DVD set:  Do a special interview with Jack Klugman and allow him to talk about the good old days when he was working on Quincy.

Thanks for giving me back the programs I love so much and Amazon.com for selling them!,1243209600,10,365,3.776315789473684
3401458,5,B00171F7MC,About bloody time ! This show is sensational and one of my late fathers favourites. Bring it on !!,1241568000,2,98,4.2105263157894735
3401459,5,B00171F7MC,"Yeah  !!  At last Season 3 will be released!!

I hope there will be a soon a german version too.
There is a very big Quincy fancommunity in Germany.

Glad to see Universal will release this Season and hopefully release Quincy to final...

Make not the same mistake like Sony with Hart to Hart...",1240963200,2,295,4.388888888888889
3401460,5,B00171F7MC,"Excellent news that Series 3 is to be released. I was starting to think that Universal had stopped at Series 1/2 which would've been a crime for all Quincy fans! Let's hope now that all the remaining series will be released much more quickly. While probably should be grateful for a dvd release, a Bluray release would be even better!",1238025600,4,334,4.583333333333333
3401461,5,B00171F7MC,"Our voices were heard at Universal!  Can't wait for Season 3!!!!
But we want them all!",1237852800,3,86,4.375
3401462,4,B00171F7MC,"For quite a while I had feared that ""Quincy"" was a one and done on the dvd market.  Seasons 1 & 2 were released as one set, then no news of season three for a few years.  Now the announcement that season three is forthcoming on June 2nd.

Those of us who grew up in the 70's know that long before there was Grissom, CSI or it's trillion spinoffs, there was Quincy.  Loosely based on (in)famous Los Angeles coroner Thomas Noguchi, Quincy is not content to remain in the confines of his laboratory.  He travels to crime scenes, confronts witnesses and suspects, questions police procedures and speaks out on sociological issues that affect both the living and the dead.

Bring on more Quincy!  Jack Klugman in the role of a lifetime and a who's who lineup of guest stars.",1237507200,29,769,4.489208633093525
3401463,5,B00171F7MC,"Like everyone else I have waited years for the 3rd and consequent seasons of Quincy M.E. to be released, but to our dismay they haven't been. Not all of the fans of this show are elderly. I'm only 24 but became a fan of the show years ago when A&E aired re-runs of it. I was very excited to find it on DVD but 13 or so episodes is only a taste of this great series. Please release more, or sell the series to a company that will!",1231632000,6,429,3.8863636363636362
