8164607,4,B000LW7NCU,"Eddie Murphy truely is comedian whose talent can span time.  His material is relatable and sometimes makes us go ""Yeah, that really is true/that way""  His impersonations are wonderful and like his other stand up show Delirious, this one is worth a viewing.",1393891200,,256,4.930232558139535
8164608,4,B000LW7NCU,I ordered this when I was overseas so I can't complain out delivery. I needed something that was going to make me laugh so why not get something that will guarantee that?  Eddie is funny and helped during those long deployment days. I would say this was a great buy for me.,1378339200,,273,4.25
