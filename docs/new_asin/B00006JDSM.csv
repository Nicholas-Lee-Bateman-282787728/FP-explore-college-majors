The characters are quite believable, and the characters are just as complex.  Especially, Desslok's change of heart.  The special effects are great and it leaves you on the edge of your seat.  But I won't tell you the surprise ending, but it's a good twist and well worth buying.",1369612800,,402,4.4520547945205475
7970021,5,B00006JDSM,"Ever since I originally saw Star Blazers on television over twenty years ago, I have always considered Desslok my favorite anime villain because he was such a complex character - even as he wanted to destroy the Star Force, he also respected them. It is in this group of episodes that he cemented his place as my favorite villain in the third episode on this DVD - when he saw the love between Wildstar and Nova, he made a choice that is completely in character for him and changes his relationship with the Star Force forever. This example of strong storytelling and characters shows why Star Blazers is one of the all-time classic anime series and why we Star Blazers fans are always going to love it.",1042588800,5,703,4.543307086614173
