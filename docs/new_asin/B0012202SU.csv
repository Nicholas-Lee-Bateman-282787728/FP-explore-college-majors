8243555,4,B0012202SU,"This is the second of two travel guide/instructionally guided tours that Mark Ritts and Ted Field made. This time they travel to Ensenada, Mexico, it was filmed in 2007, and according to Amazon released on January 01, 2008. The film is aimed at people interested in sailing, or boating to Mexico, however there are only brief tips for sailing, as this time they take a powered boat.

The film begins with a view of a few boats setting off on their voyages. Then the narrator Mark Ritts tells the viewer that he and his friends are on their way to Mexico. There is then a view of the Google Earth style globe that zooms in on Mexico as the title appear over it. Mark then explains that they started at Dana Point Harbor, which is about 50 miles south of Los Angeles. It then shows footage of the harbor, a statue of the man the harbor is named after, a book that he wrote, and a replica of the boat he was a sailor on, {however they don't mention if the ship is the original or a replica}. Mark and the rest of the crew are then seen loading the ship with supplies {he's the one with the hat and coat}. They introduce Duane Fitzgerald the captain of their ship ""Shaka"". There is then a zoom in of the globe to she their destination Ensenada. Then Bill McNeely a author is next introduces, he was also present in their first film ""Cast Off for Catalina"" an island he wrote a book about. He is then interviewed about his thoughts about the crews eventual destination. As he talks about Ensenada, there is footage of the location that they will be traveling to. Then there is footage of other people preparing their boats for a race from the ""Newport to Ensenada International Yacht Race"", as Bill explains that it is the world's largest international sailing race.

There is then tips for sailing, and powered boats, but warns that their aren't any places to refuel between where they are leaving from, and the destination 120 miles away. Patricia Miller Rains the author of ""Mexico Boating Guide"" then tells the viewer about what documents they will need when arriving in Ensenada, examples of these are all shown as she talks. There is even a view of Mark's passport photo. Along with Mark, Ted, and the captain, is also a person named John Joy making this journey. There is then a interview with their captain Duane Fitzgerald, who talks about the laws for the passengers, and the captain of the boat. Then Patricia then talks about special laws for pets, and children who are with only one parent. Captain Duane then talks about if someone is carrying prescription drugs with them on the journey, and what they might need if they want to buy them when in Mexico.

Bill the author then talks about the Coronado Islands, and there is footage of the four islands as they pass, but sadly the only inhabited island is also the one that is washed out by the sunlight, as they try to show the features of the island from the boat. Patricia, and the captain also talk about the islands, and the fish hatcheries near them. Then there is footage of the Rosarito Beach, as seen from the water. There is also footage of oil tankers, and the construction of a natural gas port. When they enter Ensenada Harbor they see the wreck of the ""S.S. Catalina"" a former steam powered cruise ship. They then show various other features of the harbor. Before they arrive at the Hotel Coral and Marina, they have to turn around and head North again outside of the harbor to reach it, but thankfully this circling back isn't shown.

Next they interview Fito Espinoza, the dock master of Hotel Coral and Marina. He then gives some tips for docking. The following day they go to the customs office after staying on the boat, and Mark is seen filling out his paperwork. Bill the author then tells about the customs and immigration processes of Mexico. There is then a interview with Jose L. Rios Hernandez, the Ensenada Port Captain, {there is no additional footage of his interview in the bonus material}. What he says is then translated by a woman listed in the credits as Shannon Barber, this translation is heard as a voice over. He talks about how the customs process is coordinated. The dock master then tells about special procedures for company vessels.

Then at about the halfway point of the film, they return to Ensenada Port, and begin their tour. First explaining the history of the bay, and pointing out where the the customs building is, and other places of interest. They look at the smaller of two boat repair yards. Patricia the author, then talks about the various marinas, and the port captain talks about what to do in case of emergencies.

They then look at the vender stands, and businesses near the water. They next stop at the bigger of the Baja Naval boat yards, and interview their Customer Service Manager, Diego Fernandez, as he talks about the types of boats they repair. {There are no extended footage of this interview in the bonus features.} After showing several other locations they interview Nico Saad, owner of the Hotel San Nicolas, he talks about what is traditionally done by most visitors when they arrive in Mexico. They then show various footage from around the city, with music from the street performers.

The next morning Mark makes breakfast of eggs and bacon, on the boat. Afterwards they set out for the Casa de Piedra Winery, and interview Alejandro D'Acosta, he talks about his family business. {There are no extended interviews of this in the bonus features.} They then visit a small restaurant on the way back to the marina.

About 2/3 of the way through the film, the story then continues the next morning as they are leaving. Patricia the author then talks about what is needed when leaving Mexico. The captain then talks about refilling the boats water supply, and to add a small amount of bleach if they are worried about the cleanliness of the water, then let the fumes escape before sealing the tank. Bill the author then explains the up hill battle against the waves and wind, when they go back to California. Mark then talks about other safety and motor checks before starting off. Along the way they stop off at the Todos Santos Islands for some fishing. Bill then gives tips on how to anchor there. The captain Duane then tells about the fishing at that location. Despite this however, they catch only one small fish which they release.

The authors Patricia, and Bill both tell about how far the crew would have had to travel if they had gone South to the next large city for supplies Cabo San Lucas about 700 miles farther South.

While heading North they eventually come to Point Loma, in San Diego Harbor. Bill then talks about the customs requirements when returning to the United States from Mexico. They then interview Al Eiselen, a Marine Interdiction Agent of the U.S. Customs. He talks about his boat and how people should respond to them, when they approach their boat. As they dock, they interview Larry Thomas, the Supervisory Officer for Customs.

They then go with the two female customs officers, and see how the procedure works, although watching, they don't interview the women. The then next interview another officer named Bill Snyder the customs Port Director, and Mathew Farmer the Agricultural Manager for Customs. They talk about what is prohibited, and must be declared. Explaining how such things as fruit, or meat can cause harm, if they caught any pathogens. Patricia the author then tells about some of the restrictions, and captain Duane tells what will happen to those items. After the customs stop, they had back towards Dana Point, as Mark tells how they can start planning their next trip to Mexico. Bill the author then gives the closing remarks about how enjoyable a visit to Mexico can be. As the credits roll, the camera looks off the back of the boat, as Mexican music plays.

Sadly there is no extra footage of Mark and the crew setting up the camera, or behind the scenes preparation for the film. In fact Mark Ritts, and his co- writer, producer, director, co-editor Ted Field, and John Joy, are only occasional seen in the film, but you see more of them then you did in the first film. And again Jay Dubin is credited as with the graphics, and packaging design. He was also director of many episodes of the television show Beakman's World, which Mark played Lester D. Ratt, a guy in a Rat suit, for 91 episodes. James Ritts is listed as co-writer of some of the music in the film, along with Jane Lui he also preforms the music.

After the credits there is a humorous afterward, where Mark stands up and announces they just caught a fish, and explains on how big it is, while he is off camera. This is said just as they run out of videotape, and the screen faded to black. Sadly this is a rather fitting way to say good bye to Mark, as about two years later on December 7, 2009 he passed away due to cancer.

On the DVD there is no chapter, or 'scene selection' option, it only has the option to watch the film from the beginning, or watch the bonus features, however this time there is music on the menu screen. Its only bonus footage is of extended versions of the interviews seen in the film, however this time their isn't the separate name and job title at the beginning of their interview, for these Bonus versions;

Because of the international nature of the film, they try to give all the available information needed to get to the destination of Ensenada, and then return, which leaves less time in the film to tour the city, and see the sights around it. When compared to the first film, the earlier film seemed to flow along much smoother, and give the viewer more variety of the scenery views. In this film they seem to have been restricted to when they could record these various scenes, and as a result, things like when they try to view Coronado Islands, and the background sunlight makes it hard to see, happen more often then they did in the first film. The street scenes are also seen as if they are trying to hide the camera, near a tree, or looking out from under a bush. There are quite a few 'window shopping' type scenes. There are some nice views of the street performers, but other then that, most of the scenes are looking up and around, and then moving on to the next set of scenes. Places like the dock yards, harbor, vender stands, and building decorations are seen in much more detail.

While the first film had several destinations, once they got to the island, here they seem to show several places but only distantly. Other then the places around the harbor, the winery is the only place outside of city that they visit, besides the restaurant as they return. There is little history of Ensenada revealed, something the first film did well with the history of Catalina Island. This film starts off good with the history of Dana Point Harbor, but then focuses mostly on the technical procedures to get to Ensenada. I would have liked to see more of the historical locations, and think they would have gotten more people to buy the DVD if they had titled it ""Cast Off for Ensenada"". Some people might buy this hoping to learn more about Mexico, which, like Ensenada, there is only bits of history explained.

The film gives a good overview of the journey, for what a boater might need for their journey, and what the city of Ensenada has to offer. Things like when Mark makes breakfast, the humorous narration, and the helpfully pleasant attitude of the people interviewed, keep the viewer feeling like they are on a vacation with a group of friends. It is a great companion to the first film, and is a fine tribute to the memory of Mark Ritts. The final scene of him running off camera to catch a fish, is possibly the last piece of film many fans will ever get to see of him enjoying himself and being humorous. If you are a fan of Mark Ritts' work I recommend taking the time to go on the journey, of these two films, and share a moment in time with one of your heroes.",1420156800,,14134,4.604447974583002
