8346897,5,B001W2GM20,"I first saw this video when we visited Mount Vernon last month. President Washington was truly a one of a kind man. We'll not see the likes of his kind ever again, President Reagan came close. G. Washington could have been made a King of the USA but he turned it down and resigned his commission in the military and returned to his beloved wife and extended family. He sincerely wanted the USA to be governed for the people and by the people. The only criticism I have of the movie is that the star, Sebastian Roch, who did a very good acting job, is only 5'11"" tall. George Washington was 6'2"" and back then that made him a 'giant' of a man. He towered over most everyone back in the 1700's. The movie run time is only 24 minutes but it does highlight the man's motivations, military victories and insights to his private life. I had to add it to my collection.",1401408000,,862,4.294478527607362
8346898,5,B001W2GM20,"Whenever Washington needed an experienced field commander he called on his major general Benedict Arnold. He had stood up to the full force of the British and hit back hard. With Arnold at his side, Washington could be bold in launching offensives.
""I'm ready at all times,"" Arnold wrote, but having been injured in battle, passed over for promotion, and not given credit he deserved for victories in the field, he began contemplating ways to line his pockets.
Reaching out to British loyalist John Andre, Arnold asked for money in return for information on defenses Washington set up around West Point, a prize the British had been after since the beginning of the war. Andre agreed, put together a plan, but was soon captured and made to talk.
Only a trade for Arnold would have saved Andre, but Arnold escaped capture and joined the British army. Convicted of being a spy, Andre was hanged.",1375660800,,893,4.805194805194805

He may have not been considered rich by his peers but he and his were from the social elite and had much more money than the countries poor.  Otherwise not matter what, he would not have been an officer and and gentleman.  Back then you were either born a gentleman or you were not.  He was.  Now days the President of the United States has to proclaim an officer to be a gentleman.
.  That said it was good, it contained some nice historical information, how he met his wife was one that is usually over looked in History Class.  It is a nice little film.",1345766400,,824,5.292307692307692
8346900,4,B001W2GM20,"Just a small warning: ""George Washington: We Fight to be Free"" is not a full-length biographical movie, but a short film showing some of the highlights of the first American president's life.

And it does give you a sort of ""feel"" for George Washington, through brief snippets of his life -- Washington as a warrior, as a statesman, as a gentleman farmer, and even of his relationship with his wife Martha. Rather than showing him as a static, elderly figure, this short film depicts him as a vital, compassionate figure.

The narrative mostly hits on the most interesting parts of Washington's life and career. A flashback to his youth shows him as a British soldier stopping by a friend's house during the French and Indian War, and encountering the intelligent widow Martha Dandridge Custis, whom he later married. Unfortunately, many years later he found himself in another war -- and this time he had sickly, inexperienced troops ravaged by cold and illness.

However, we can see why those troops would follow him. In another flashback to Washington's early military career, we see him as the colonial officers assisting General Edward Braddock. Braddock is contemptuous of Washington's cautious approach... until Indian warriors attack, and Washington is forced to take command and lead the panicked troops.

Finally, we see what happened after Washington's service in the army came to an end, and how he came back home to his beloved Mount Vernon and Martha. Sadly, that wouldn't last either.

In case you have never been to Mount Vernon (and I recommend that everybody go at least once), ""George Washington: We Fight To Be Free"" is a museum movie privately funded by the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association. It's basically meant to educate people on the basics of George Washington's life before they actually venture out into his home and the surrounding buildings.

And it's a sublime, beautifully-made piece of work. Kees Van Oostrum directs each scene with lots of atmosphere and period detail -- the bleak grey camps of the American troops, the firelit warmth of Mount Vernon, and the woodland chaos of the French and Indian wars. The highlight is the battle between the British/colonial troops and the Indian attackers, which is worthy of a major Hollywood movie.

They also got actual actors to play these roles. While Sebastian Roch doesn't look much like Washington did, he is excellent at showing many sides to the legendary president -- as a noble statesman, a compassionate general who talks to his wounded soldiers, and a roaring warrior who repeatedly has horses shot out from under him. Stephen Lang serves double-duty as a narrator for Washington's life, and as his longtime friend Dr. James Craik.

The United States is a sorry mess of a country at the moment, but there's still something incredibly stirring about the story of George Washington -- even in fragments. Definitely give this one a watch, whether it's on DVD or in Mount Vernon's movie theater.

NOTE: I recommend buying ""We Fight To Be Free"" from the shops at Mount Vernon if at all possible. It might be slightly more expensive, but it means your money is actually being used to maintain Mount Vernon and restore long-lost structures.",1327104000,3,3221,4.983240223463687
