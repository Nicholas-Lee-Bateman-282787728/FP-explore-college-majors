7829247,1,6302669928,"Based upon the unqualified success of ""Killpoint"" Fong teams up with Cameron Mitchell to bring us a classic film of the era hitting on all the hot news items. Fong is an ex-cop now a PI. He drives the worst vehicle in town and eats chicken's feet. When Patty Hearst joins Jim Jones' cult, Fong springs into action with a tough guy contest to recruit martial art fighters/boxers to battle guys with assault guns. Our holy man has both a red dot and Star of David tattoo on his check, so we know he is really holy. It's all good clean fun.

Originally known as ""Savage Sunday"" available on multi-packs. It totally smokes ""Killpoint"".  The metal saw on the hood had me scratching my head.",1475193600,,685,4.472
7829248,2,6302669928,"LOW BLOW (1986) - After the success of KILLPOINT (1984), Crown International Pictures commissioned this inferior follow-up, using much of the same talent both in front and behind the cameras. When Karen Templeton (Patti Bowling) disappears from college and ends up a member of the mysterious Yarakunda's (Cameron Mitchell; RAW FORCE - 1982) religious cult, her wealthy father, John Templeton (Troy Donahue; SOUTH SEAS MASSACRE - 1974), hires ex-cop and now private investigator Joe Wong (Leo Fong; ENFORCER FROM DEATH ROW - 1987; who also produced and wrote the screenplay here) to find his daughter and bring her home. Yarakunda is a Jim Jones clone who runs a commune with convicted conwoman Karma (Akosua Busia) called Unity Village, where their followers are kept half-starved, work long hours on the farm and are brainwashed into a new way of thinking called ""Universal Enlightenment"" (as in ""Let me enlighten you of your family fortune""). As Karen slowly begins to fall under Yarakunda's control (although, as we find out, Karma is the real brains behind the scam), Joe puts a team together to help rescue her. The team members include boxer Corky (frequent Fong and Mitchell collaborator Stack Pierce; TRANSFORMED - 2003), Latino street gang member Chico (David Cochran) and busboy Sticks (Manny DeLa Pena), who has that name for a reason. Joe enters Unity Village under the guise of reporter ""Jack Chan"" (!), but his true identity is quickly discovered and the guards (one of them portrayed by Tae-Bo shiller Billy Blanks) knock him out and throw him in a room with follower Mark Sims (Paul Bogh), who tried to escape the commune but was captured. Joe and Mark escape (the old ""fake fire in the locked room"" trick) and flee in Joe's junker of a car (it refuses to start, so Joe has to hit the engine repeatedly with a lugnut wrench to get it going!). Karma sends some thugs to kill Joe, but he quickly teaches them all a lesson (one thug has a bunch of puppies dumped on his face and then Joe destroys their Mercedes with a two-by-four and an electric metal saw while they are cowering inside it!). After holding a strongman tournament in a mud pit to find two more people to help him (he picks gambler Fuzzy [Woody Farmer] and musclewoman Cody [Elaine Hightower]), Joe and his gang raid Unity Village and rescue Karen after a very underwhelming series of skirmishes, bringing her back to her appreciative Daddy. After paying everyone off, Joe and his secretary Diane (Diane Stevenett) decide to head to Las Vegas for rest and relaxation, if only Joe's car would start (Better spend some of your new cash on another car, Joe!).  It's hard to imagine after this synopsis that LOW BLOW could be boring and deadly slow, but that's exactly what it is. It doesn't help that director Frank Harris, who also directed the much superior KILLPOINT, as well as THE PATRIOT (1986) and AFTERSHOCK (1989), is working with an extremely low budget here, as the tech credits, including sound recording, photography and fight choreography are all exceptionally poor. I can't help but blame Leo Fong (who sounds like a Texas cowboy trapped in an oriental body) for the film's shortcomings, since he is the Producer and followed this film with a string of vanity productions using his Joe Wong character (RAPID FIRE - 1988; LICENSE TO KILL - 1988; BLOOD STREET - 1990), all of them technically poor and filmed on less-than-shoestring budgets. Unlike KILLPOINT, Cameron Mitchell is woefully underused here, appearing in a robe and dark sunglasses (with a huge star tattooed on his cheek!) and mumbling his lines like he's in an alcoholic stupor (which I don't doubt). As an action film, LOW BLOW fails miserably (it's filmed on barebones sets or in bleak, colorless locations), but as an unintentional comedy, it does have its moments (The scene with the puppies is sure to elicit a laugh and try to count how many times Fong is called ""Chinaman"" here. It would make a good drinking game.). Proceed at your own risk. Originally released on VHS by Vestron Video and available on DVD as part of BCI Navarre's MAXIMUM ACTION 8 MOVIE COLLECTION, which is now OOP, but easily obtainable (for now). Rated R.",1369958400,,4188,4.849162011173185
7829249,1,6302669928,"The other reviewer is right, this movie is poo. The only reason why I got this is because when I looked up Billy Blanks's filmography on the net this was one of the first to appear on the highlighted list of his flicks so I bought it, but only coz I am a huge Bily Blanks fan and intend to collect every one of his movies wether they are bad or not. This is the plot. On the outskirts of San Fransisco, a killer is loose, armed only with his mind. The leader of a mind-warping cult, Yarakunda (Cameron Mitchell) needs only to utter a few words to send his followers on a rampage of murder and destruction. When the daughter of a wealthy industrialist, Templeton (Troy Donahue), falls under his evil spell, Templeton decides to fight back. He hires an ex-cop, Joe Wong (Leo Fong), turned private investigator who is known on the street for getting jobs done. With the help of 5 special underground martial arts fighters, they penetrate the commune on a dangerous rescue and destroy the mission. Billy Blanks is Yarakunda's top fighter/hencheman and plays a small role but still ends up having a couple of short fight scenes in this movie.",1132099200,,1137,4.524271844660194
7829250,1,6302669928,"WOW...This is one of the worst movies made..and I don't often go that low..but this martial arts movie is so bad, it's hilarious!

Writer/producer/actor Leo Wong moves through the movie like a somnambulent ghost, and the action scenes are staged so ridiculously, you wonder how he got anyone to finance this one!  Also, Akosua Busia (Color Purple, Mad City) as the cult's Karma gives one of the most hilarious speeches ever trapped on celluloid.  At the cult farm, she gives the leader's message, and she is so overwrought and dramatic, it is absolutely sidesplitting.  Add Cameron Mitchell as the hooded guru, Troy Donahue as a college student's rich father, and you have the makings for the coup de gras of action films.

This one is so bad, you want to sterilize your VCR.

Please, unless you really want to laugh a lot, avoid this one!",1094601600,,839,4.751724137931035
