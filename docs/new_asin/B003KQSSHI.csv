8398900,5,B003KQSSHI,"IMHO, this is an exquisite family type drama. It's the story of a young single parent father and his early teen daughter. While on a field trip pursuing his hobby of butterfly collecting, he dies, and suddenly finds himself back at his home. It turns out he's now a ghost, and only his daughter, a young woman neighbor, and his best friend can see him. It's a beautiful story of a young father reconciling himself to his untimely death, while doing what he can to continue caring for his young daughter. Not maudlin in the least, there is a sufficient amount of comic relief, especially regarding his best friend, whose wife, who cannot see the ghost, thinks has gone crazy.

I've seen numerous television dramas from Japan over the past seven or eight years, and this is one of the most memorable. Definitely as gentle and ethereal is it's poetic title. The cast is wonderful, especially Tomoka Kurokawa, who plays the young daughter. A bit pricey here, but certainly a rewarding watching experience. Spoken in Japanese with English subtitles. Highly recommended.",1390780800,,1064,4.878453038674033
