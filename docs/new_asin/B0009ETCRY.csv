8059833,2,B0009ETCRY,"In my quest to find unedited versions of The Cosby Show Season 1, I bought this season as three separate discs, episodes 1-8, 9-16, 17-24.  Apparently I did not research this product fully and they are the syndicated episodes.  If you are willing to buy Season 1 as it appears on Nick at Nite, I would buy the entire Season 1 collection instead of this product.  The Season 1 compilation costs less and includes the 90 minute special. A lot of reviewers are outraged that the NBC versions were not released and I don't blame them. I am very familiar with the originals, and it does get to me when I notice segments that are missing. Some are only little scences (e.i. Rudy dancing in the Jitterbug episode) and others are important to Cosby's long running jokes (Russell and Anna greeting their gandkids in the Independence Day episode).  Only about 2 minutes were spliced from each of the original shows, but it does make a differemce to me.  Because I don't have cable and don't see the re-runs, I was willing to buy Season 1 as is, but if this season as aired on NBC is ever released, these three DVDs are going in the trash and I will buy the shows I grew up watching.",1154304000,,1172,4.407407407407407
