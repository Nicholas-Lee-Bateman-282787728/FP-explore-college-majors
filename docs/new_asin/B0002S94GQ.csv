2117272,1,B0002S94GQ,"First off, allow me to say that I love a bad movie as much as the next bad movie fan, but bad movies have to have SOME entertainment value other than what was intended to make it.  This is an unsuccessful attempt at blending horror & comedy and doesn't make it as either one.  It's pretty well a rip-off of the first Jeepers Creepers, for starters, but when the ""comedy"" does creep in it's at moments when the gore is so extreme it just didn't work for me.  And how can some dude running around in clogs call someone ELSE a wuss?  Amazing.  Anyway it's about 2 lamebrains on a cross country trip to a wedding and they encounter this giant vehicle that's something like a tank with big tires, driven by this mutant thing.  There are lots of moments here that, had they been played as straight horror, might have been pretty nasty, but since there's an attempt to make them humorous, it just doesn't work at all.  If you are just a gore fan you may not be disappointed but if you like a bit of intelligence in your movies, pass this one up.  Ptoeey.",1106956800,,1047,4.279187817258883
2117273,4,B0002S94GQ,"I'm not sure why I choose to watch so many of these direct to video slasher films.  Most of the time these films will make me question my existence (90 mns spent doing what?) other times my financial wisdom.  Well, the reason I waft through piles of cinematic junk is that out of every 5 or 10 or so of these movies I will unearth a gem.  Yes folks, ""Monster Man"" qualifies as such.  I wouldn't be surprised if 5 years from now this film becomes a cult classic of sorts and if not well, it deserves to be.

2 college buddies named Harley and Adam go on a road trip through the desert in order to attend a wedding.  Everything goes well until they get run off the road by a Monster Truck (or big-wheeler, whatever they call these things).  While getting their car tended to in the small redneck town where every hick has either a stump arm or stump leg, they end up picking up a hot hitchhiker babe.  As they head back on the road, they will discover to their horror that the Monster Truck is still hot on their chase and wants them to be the next ones to join the land of stumpies...

While I loved this film, I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's very original.  It abides by many of the routine staples of Road-Trip suspense; a sultry hitchhiker, car troubles, roach motels, road diners&gas stations populated by mindless (or so it seems) hicks.  What elevates this picture is the chemistry of the two lead characters and the synergy that manages to protrude from them regardless of the fact they are two completely different individuals.  You have shy wimpy Adam, a 25-year old virgin who would be scared of his own shadow, contrasted with Harley, a testosterone-fuelled practical joker.  Harley annoyed me at first but I warmed up to him real fast.  His endless fratboy jokes about the ins and outs of the female anatomy were very amusing.  And best of all would be sexy and mysterious hitchhiker Sarah, a quasi-goth who will not divulge anything from her past.  The acting was excellent in this film.

What ""Monster Man"" does so well is combining two genres, those of horror and comedy.  It manages to excite and entertain even in between scenes of carnage due to solid acting and humour from the 3 leads. What is also neat is that unlike most horror/comedy hybrids the horror is not watered down instead this film is very gory and very gruesome with scenes that will appease the hardcore blood n' guts fan.  The fact that this film is distributed by Lions Gate probably explains why it's such high-quality for a slasher film.  So yes, although this film is trashy and does rip off TCM in several respects I wholeheartedly recommend you watch this now!  Bloody good fun.",1101600000,8,2678,4.480412371134021
2117274,1,B0002S94GQ,"An absolutely dumb ""teen horror comedy"" in which two dorky losers in a old Chevrolet station wagon tangle with some psycho dude in a ""monster truck"" that looks like a tank with wheels.  For horror & comedy to work right one must do something different than this, the horror & gore is too over-the-top to be in anything that thinks it's a comedy, and while maybe this will bring laughter to anyone with an IQ less than a dust bunny, most folks will probably find this just as repugnant as I did.  Chortle with glee at a bar full of amputees, and giggle hysterically at a guy that has a tire rut through his chest as he laments that he won't be able to **** his sister.  This is of the ""what were they thinking?"" school of film making, and if I were heading that up this would get a D-minus.  I'd give 'em an F but F is for ""effort"", isn't it?",1100649600,,841,4.141104294478527
2117275,4,B0002S94GQ,"Just when you thought it was safe to make a wrong turn, another mutant redneck is lurking in the winding roads of nowhere.  Suprisingly dark humored and layered in blood and gore, this shocker is a tribute to various horror/cult movies.  Yes, there is that familiar hot girl hitchhiker which we all know is never good, and yes at times the humor is lame, but the thrills are there.  Relentless pursuits, and a clever ending make this rise above fare like last years ""Detour.""  This is going to be a cult classic all its own, and I am certain more sequels will follow.  Look for the glorious tribute to ""Dead-Alive,"" ""Re-Animatoe,""and even ""The Road Warrior.""

2117276,3,B0002S94GQ,"Think about taking 90 minutes to combine Joyride, Wrong Turn, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, House of 1000 Corpses, Deliverance, Jeepers Creepers, Maximum Overdrive, and a really bad Jack Black wannabe and putting it into a movie. Stop thinking, it's been done for ya in the flick that is Monster Man. Taken directly from Joyride's concept, we have 2 college buddies cross countrying it so that one of them can confess his love for a girl. Along the way, they seem to upset someone who drives a big big truck and that big big truck's driver is determined to make them pay. After picking up a hitchhiking damsel in distress, complete mayhem ensues.

 Oh, how full of cheese this movie is. And oh, how much of a rip-off it is. Could it be a spoof? Possibly. But no matter, this movie was one thoughtless 90 minutes full of fun. I enjoyed just waiting to reference any other movie I could catch, and some of the situations the trio got into were actually fun (ie the dream / roadkill scene).

 There's nothing special about Monster Man. The only ones that will most likely enjoy this are those who enjoy cheesy horror movies. Gorehounds may be pleased also (oooh the crushed car / dead man bit, and the finale). It's just fun.",1098144000,2,1221,4.561643835616438
2117277,1,B0002S94GQ,"I really do not know where to begin. This movie is simply insulting to all who watch it, not just your self-respecting horror fans. This movie is poorly written and directed. It feels as though the director really has no clue about horror movies. This is clearly demonstrated in the fact that he ripped off so many great horror flicks, but mentions none of them in the commentary. If you are a true fan of horror movies this will be of no interest to you.  If you, on the otherhand, think I Know What You Did Last Summer or Valentine were cinematic masterpieces then by all means rent or buy this movie. Why anyone would give this movie more than one star (if it were an option I would have given it ""0"") is beyond me.  Maybe friends and relatives of the cast and crew (those poor souls). In closing, I would just like to say that if you don't have money to burn, dont' bother.",1098057600,3,877,4.27710843373494
2117278,4,B0002S94GQ,"Wow this movie surprised the heck out of me. I looked at the cover and thought it would be very ignorant. I mean a killer who drives a monster truck? Its actually not too Bad. Not too many B-horror movies stay with you but this one will. Its your normal B-horror, with above average picture quality, and half way decent acting, and some nice gross out FXs. Even though this movie steals some concepts from the Texas chainsaw massacre, I must say there was some scenes in this movie that I have never seen in any other movie before, and they we gory and awesome! So why not 5 stars? Its sags in the middle, and is tainted with a love story, the love story is so developed upon that it starts to anchor down the whole movie. You get so involved with the love story, you will literally get to a point where you say ""what happened to the monster?"" I would have gave this closer to a 3 star rating, but I gave it the 4th star for the gore. They just don't put stuff like this in them anymore. Heck, they don't put stuff like this in them period. (when you get to the road kill scene in the hotel, then you'll see) . It will make you cringe at one minute and laugh at the next, nice movie, way better than I had hoped for.

They decide they want to make a movie but don't have any money and no connections to the industry.  Brainstorming on what they do have, they realize they know this guy with a ridiculous monster truck, a cute girl that shares their weed connection, a friend that works at a morgue, and a neighbor that has a video camera. Then they just starting shooting and after spending a half day of editing about 4 hours of footage, Monster Man was born.  It is truly inspirational and highly entertaining especially if you watch it with that feeling that you're in on the joke (or you just smoke a lot).

2117295,4,B0002S94GQ,"Among the hundreds, if not thousands, of crappy straight to dvd horror films out there, you can usually find a diamond among all the crap. This film happens to be one such case.

Adam is going to confess his love for Betty. His pal, Harely, some how sneaks in the backseat to stop him. He eventually is brought along and the movie is going fine. A black hearse passes them by, then Harley makes fun of rednecks and monster trucks, and a monster truck starts chasing them soon after. They pick up a beautiful hitchhiker along the way. Soon after, the monster in the monster truck is chasing them down.

 The three main characters are very well done and enjoyable to watch for a cast of unknowns. The man in the monster make up may be the finest villan to ever grace a straight to dvd horror film, I appauld whoever designed it. Sure this film has a few plot holes but it's a very enjoyable film. You won't regret picking this one up.",1305417600,,932,4.344827586206897
2117296,1,B0002S94GQ,"Wow, it is really hard to describe how utterly pathetic this movie is on every possible level.  I bought this movie due to a couple good reviews and by thinking to myself, how could a movie about a monster man killer in a monster truck possibly be bad?  Well, it can be bad, VERY bad. I even love horror movies and monster trucks, but this title even fails to satisfy these simple genres.  Whoever gave this movie positive ratings on here is either being paid to do so or seriously needs to have their head examined by a professional.

I never do product reviews on here, but I felt I needed to speak up in this case to save people some time and money that could be potentially wasted on this garbage.  Folks, this movie really has nothing to offer what so ever.  It is not a horror movie, an action movie, a comedy, or even generally decent by any respect.  It is basically almost 2 hours of trash talking and over use of camera zooming and color distortion.  The acting is just terrible and is not the slightest bit believable.  The props and so called ""effects"" look like something a kindergartner put together.  Corpses, gore, and other ""what not"" look like they are made from play-doh or something.  Even the monster truck fails to be entertaining.  It practically looks like an over-sized garbage can with big tires.  Even the scenes of it driving, car crushing, and jumping are ruined by pathetically jerky camera work and cruddy presentation.  In fact, the camera work is so rough and grainy that it almost makes the monster truck look fake.

This movie is a true waste of time and is literally painful to watch.  I didn't have too high of expectations to begin with for a budget movie like this, but few times have I ever been as disappointed with a movie as I was with this.  In fact, this movie angered me so much I actually threw it away after watching it.  Yes, you read right, I threw it in the garbage where it belongs.  I was at first just going to return it, but then I thought that could mean that some other poor unsuspecting individual might actually try watching this copy and also be sorely disappointed to the point of absolute disgust like I was.  So, I did the world a favor and trashed it as I just couldn't allow this to happen to someone else and wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

This movie is now on my personal list of top worst movies ever made.  It comes in 2nd only to the worst movie I have ever seen, which is a movie called ""Zombie Strippers"".  So, I am taking the liberty of saving you time, money, and pain and will just tell you right now to stay away from this movie by any means necessary.

2117299,5,B0002S94GQ,I saw this movie on TV.  It was pretty cool.  It was better than I thought it would be.

2117300,4,B0002S94GQ,"If you are on the fence about a low budget horror and happen to read a tagline that says ""On this highway the roadkill is HUMAN,"" you know you have found yourself a winner. Monster Man is one of those films we've seen bits and pieces of the years but never sat down to watch from tap to buzzer until now. A four star rating for the film may seem a little generous to some horror fans, but for us it's just right. State of mind is what this one is all about. If you go into it knowing what to expect you should have a decent time with some good laughs to follow.

We start off with two guys named Adam & Harley taking a road trip to the wedding of a girl they're obsessed with. While traveling they happen to pick up a very cute hitch-hiker by the name of Sarah and stop off at a local bar filled with amputee rednecks. After they thoroughly piss off the locals they hit the road again only to be terrorized by the Monster Man in his monster truck. The truck is like something out of Mad Max, hey dutch, and the driver is like something from another planet. He continues to appear and attempt to take them out while they barely escape. Finally they take matters into their own hands and try to kill the Monster Man before he kills then, and that's when things get really strange.

Overall a gorey, corny, comedy/horror that somehow seems to work just fine. Usually these comedy horror films are way overdone and lose any value about 20 minutes in but this one balanced it right. By no means is Monster Man a great film but it doesn't claim to be. If you go into it knowing what to expect it should be a fun watch for the right viewer.",1242518400,2,1633,4.1645569620253164

I understand a little humor at the beggining of the film,just before the action starts,but when they over do it, it just dissipates or softens the suspense,and there is when it gets corny,if it wasn't for that, believe me,it would be a a lot better. The effects are ok and maybe the story too,overall...worth watching once.",1193529600,,433,4.697368421052632
2117303,5,B0002S94GQ,"I like horror, and comedy.  This movie has both.  I enjoyed the thrill of the chase, as a monsterous-looking man runs down people in a monster truck that is built like a tank.  Two guys in a car; the driver who is trying to get to a wedding to let the bride-to-be know how he really feels about her, and his friend who tags along for the ride to ridicule, and tease, his friend, and to let him know that he's wasting his time going after someone who isn't interested in him.  They meet a woman who hitches a ride with them, and then the monster man chases them down a long desolite road, through a town of rednecks, after they see the monster man running a guy over, they soon realize that they are next.  Monster man catches them, and then the ending is a surpise, but I enjoyed this movie.  A movie with nothing but slashing, becomes as monontonous as a movie with nothing but comedy; but when you put them both together, in a way that balances them out throughout the movie, you have one heck of a movie.

It blends these types of horror films and adds its on twist! The two male stars have good comedic chemistry as they embark on a road trip to a friends wedding. As they drive thru an eerie town full a people mysteriously missing arms and legs, they discover the truth of why a madman in a converted monster truck has been following them and terrorizing them. The macabre and sinister plot thickens when they pick up a beautiful young girl with a few secrets of her own. Gore fans will find plenty of blood and guts to feast their eyes upon and, also a far fetched and funny story to go with it!

Sure there's a few moments where the gross-out humor is toooooooo much but if you can bare with it the rest is GREAT.  Good enough production value (Lions Gate) and two great characters (one of which you might recognize from SEVERAL movies including Not Another Teen Movie).  I'd compare it to Idle Hands or something of the sort in the fact that the humor scenes are hilarious and and the scary scenes are really creepy.  Oh yeah, GREAT ugly monster on this one, he's a scary lookin' thing.

2117306,3,B0002S94GQ,"While a parody of a lot of stuff and a genre hybrid, at its core ""Monster Man"" is another entry in the familial horror category started by ""Psycho"" back in 1960. The American family as demented in-breds who lure victims to a home they have turned into a slaughterhouse. Try to imagine a remake of Spielberg's ""Duel"" but instead of Dennis Weaver as the terrorized motorist you substitute an unfunny version of Laurel and Hardy; instead of the faceless tanker driver you substitute Leather-face from ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre""; and instead of a scary looking tank truck you substitute the big dune buggy from ""The Road Warrier"".

If this isn't bad enough you replace ""Duel's"" minimalist dialogue with a lot of Chatty Cathy banter from the pen of Michael Davis (the guy who gave us the script for ""Double Dragon"").

In ""Monster Man"" Stanley is called Adam (Eric Jungmann) and Ollie is called Harley (Justin Urich), a couple of students on a road trip mission to pull a ""Graduate"" type intervention at the upcoming wedding of Adam's unrequited love. The first 30 minutes of the movie are simply awful as there is no escaping Davis's horribly unfunny dialogue, although it could actually just be improv from the two marginal actors. Even the introduction of the ""Monster Man"" title character fails to improve things.

Then the film picks up a bit with the improbable appearance of ""Mangler Reborn"" girl Aimee Brooks, playing a voluptuous hitchhiker named Sarah. I began to actually pay attention at this point, in part because Brooks was the first sign that a professional actor was in the cast, but mostly because she is stunningly beautiful. Jungmann even gets to drool on her several times and I suspect that he financed the movie for exactly that purpose.

Unlike ""Duel"" the truck is not very threatening and Davis fails to generate much suspense but the production design is pretty good in a ""Texas Chainsaw"" kind of way and a lot of deformed people begin popping up in unexpected places.

For a short while near the end it looks like Davis is going to go out with an original ending and salvage the whole thing, turning it into an extremely twisted black comedy. Instead he wimps out and ends it conventionally. Which at least gives things a consistent retarded quality. Aimee can't entirely save this mess but she elevates it from painful to tolerable.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1143244800,,2405,4.783132530120482

The bottom line is Monster Man is fun. It looks like those responsible for this movie knew they were making a low-budget feature and therefore didn't take themselves too seriously. As a result, it seems like the cast was having fun during production and ultimately, the audience has fun too. Although it's not that scary, the laughs more than make up for this deficiency.

Other than that, there's not much to the plot or story, but that's not the point here.  Monster Man works for what it is for the most part, and that's a low budget, blood soaked romp that with it's toungue firmly in cheek and purposely campy all the way.  It's not a masterpiece of the genre, but it's not trying to be either.  All in all, Monster Man is outrageously offensive and obscenely gorey, which is just what real horror fans are looking for as a reminder of what a real horror film is: not PG-13 or a remake of a Japanese film.",1132185600,4,1046,4.21

Might be worth your while to rent it, but I'd recommend you rent it before buying, some might like it, some might not. I didn't find it scary, and I found the opening 15 minutes setting up the fact that the 2 guys have this joking relationship a bit annoying, they could have cut down on that.

2117313,1,B0002S94GQ,"I did not have any expectations for this movie, I knew very little about it. There it was sitting on the shelf of the library, and I said ""oh sure, whatever"" and threw it in my backpack. I proceeded to read some reviews on it, and saw that a majority of people thought it was okay, that it was kind of sick, there was an attractive girl, some lengthy interactions between the main actors that should have been cut short. I watched it, and I have to agree that some parts were really demented, but nothing new in the realm of gore, the girl was okay looking, the whole Yoda voice during sex was alarming and I am not sure what the writer was going for with that. The whole thing smelled like a huge stinky rip off. The writer on the extra features says that someone told him that the name ""Monster Man"" was creating ""a buzz"" within some studio groups (maybe among the janitors) and it was up to him to create a movie to go along with the name. So he writes a story about two dudes, one is a dork the other a machismo pig they are on their way to the dorks long lost crush to tell her that he loves her, they are on a back road some where, a hearse and a monster truck comes along and they pick up a sexy hitchhiker, throw in some missing limbs, and we end up eventually at the monster mans house, the hitchhiker turns out to be the sister, there is another brother who is basically cut in half, she is a witch who has used body parts to keep her family alive, the dork become a hero of sorts and yadda yadda yadda. In all of that I can say they plagiarized Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Jeepers Creepers, Maximum Overdrive, House of 1000 corpses (the beautiful sister switcharoo?) and many others. I wanted both the main guys to die; seriously I didn't care about them even a tiny bit, and the girl? I wanted to scream out ""hey nice crows feet"". Well I guess that's what you get when you base a whole movie around a Title instead of an original idea.",1125360000,,1944,4.172872340425532
2117314,3,B0002S94GQ,"A Lion's Gate release can't be all bad, right? Right. The acting was very good, the plot and formula different, the filming clear and not grainy. The only reason why I gave it three stars instead of four was because of the lack of action, the brunt coming towards the end, and too little of Monster Man--but enough of an ending to pack a powerful punch, nevertheless. I do recommend this movie due to the strong character development, if not anything else, and a very good ending.",1122854400,,480,4.528735632183908
2117315,5,B0002S94GQ,"If I had to make a list of extraordinarily influential horror films of the last forty years, titles like ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""Halloween,"" and Tobe Hooper's seminal screamfest ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" would stand at the top. These three films have, and continue to have, a massive influence on filmmakers. In fact, I'm willing to bet that most beginners hoping to break into the world of horror movie making lens a variation of one of these four films as their first feature. Oftentimes, such efforts lead to disaster. The market can only withstand so many cheap 'n cheesy flicks before collapsing under the sheer weight of banality. But once in a while a diamond in the rough appears, a magical effort that manages to take a tired formula and infuse it with something approaching brilliance or, if not brilliance, at least a modicum of originality. Enter the low budget gorefest ""Monster Man,"" a ripoff of Hooper's masterpiece if there ever was one. Sure, it's derivative, but it's also a fabulously fun film for horror fans everywhere. I compliment Michael Davis for crafting this extremely sick piece of celluloid.

""Monster Man"" introduces us to two losers by the name of Adam (Eric Jungmann) and his abrasive buddy Harley (Justin Urich) tooling down the highway in a car. The purpose of this road trip revolves around Adam's hope that he can intercede in the coming nuptials of a long sought after love. Harley apparently came along for the ride in order to torture his pal with a running string of bad jokes, childish insults, and general pronouncements berating his pal for pursuing a woman who has never had an interest in Adam. This back and forth banter runs on and on for what feels like forever, which left this viewer with a decidedly negative impression of the film. I need not have worried, however, as ""Monster Man"" soon kicks into high gear with the introduction of two interesting elements. One, some cretin in a monster truck that makes the semi from ""Duel"" look like a moped arrives on the scene to torment our unfortunate travelers. Predictably, Harley manages to anger this road rager in the waiting--witness what he does to the truck at the gas station--which leads to several frightening encounters on the highway. Two, Harley and Adam pick up a gorgeous hitchhiker named Sarah (Aimee Brooks), whose voluptuous presence and seeming interest in the lovelorn Adam lead to several humorous situations.

From this point, when Sarah and the frightening truck enter the picture, ""Monster Man"" turns into a nail biting turn towards gruesome horror. Our boys start running into a number of local citizens, most of whom are missing either arms or legs or both. Hmmm. The truck reemerges from time to time, becoming more threatening with each appearance. Well, one thing leads to another, and it isn't too long before Harley and Adam are in the fight of their lives with a close-knit clan that looks like a cross between the wackos from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and the loopy denizens from the television show ""The Munsters."" When we finally get to meet Mister Monster Man (Michael Bailey Smith), the driver of the aforementioned truck, it's no wonder that Adam and Harley express more than a wee bit of fear. Then there's the atrocity that goes by the name Brother Fred (Joe Goodrich), a mouthy lad sporting an injury that no insurance provider in the world would touch with a ten-foot pole. The third member of this lunatic family, a person with the habit of impersonating Yoda at the most inappropriate times, will remain anonymous here to avoid spoiling the movie. It's quite a trio Adam and his pal must overcome if they are to survive. You'll need to watch the movie if you want to see whether or not they make it through this nightmare.

""Monster Man"" is a representative of that ultra-rare specimen in the horror film zoo: the gore/comedy picture. Few films attempt to bridge the gap between giggles and grue, and even fewer make the leap. Director Davis goes for both types of yucks here, and he largely succeeds in pulling it off. Witness Adam's experience with ""Yoda,"" or Harley's penchant for the most outrageous lines, or--heaven help us--the most unfortunate union between a tongue and road kill ever captured on film as proof of this assertion. Repeatedly, Davis coaxes guffaws out of his audience even as he soaks the screen down with sauce. Trucks pound limbs into taffy, eyeballs dangle out of sockets, vehicles mulch bodies, sharp objects slice and dice, and a throat or two cracks a wickedly red grin in this truly disgusting movie. Oh yeah! If you love the red stuff, ""Monster Man"" is your cup of tea. Heck, if you love movies that look like a million bucks, you'll want to give this one a spin. ""Monster Man"" looks stylish in a way that belies its miniscule budget, and the pacing really picks up after the first twenty minutes or so. Nearly every element of the movie clicks in just the right way, to the point that the viewer really won't mind that they are watching a ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" ripoff.

Extras abound on the DVD. Trailers for ""Ju-On,"" ""Death Watch,"" ""Open Water,"" ""Stage Beauty"" are here to convince you to spend more money on horror DVDs. Supplements specific to the film include a gory animated trailer; a full film commentary with Davis, Jungmann, and Urich; a gag reel; and a nifty behind the scenes feature that shows us Michael Davis is a way over the top personality. Fun. I'm hearing a lot of noise about two ""Monster Man"" sequels, both directed by Davis, which might find space in our DVD players in the future. I'm looking forward to seeing more from this director. I'm also expecting more gore and more laughs.",1120176000,17,5713,4.785207700101317
2117316,1,B0002S94GQ,"Well, let me just say this...and I'm going to make this short. I found this movie more funny than scary. I was not even scared or creeped. I really wasn't sure if this movie was supposed to be a comedy or a horror, or both mixed together. What was up with the tank/truck on the big wheels? What's with the friend wearing the clogs?! LOL! I found myself laughing at things that were probably not meant to be funny. I didn't even make it through the movie...I fell asleep. I think my boyfriend fell asleep too. Well...if you are a serious horror movie fan, don't waste your time. If you want something to watch because there's nothing on, then try this.",1119830400,,651,4.3884297520661155
2117317,3,B0002S94GQ,"Monster Man is part Joy Ride and part Texas Chainsaw Massacre, sprinkled liberally with humor to create an enjoyable little horror comedy.  Not great, but better than the average low-budgeted fare.  Two estrange buddies Adam and Harley on their way to attend the wedding of a girl they both had a thing for.  Adam is a prim and proper, and quite (...)-retentive twenty-something virgin.  Harley is loud, crude, and obnoxious.  While in a roadside watering hole Harley insults the local hillbillies.  Soon they find themselve stalked by a gigantic monster truck that tries to kill them.  When Adam stops to use a roadside toilet, he gets a look at their stalker, who has a ""Leatherface"" like appearance with a patchwork face of scars and stitches.  They think they lose the truck and rest in a motel, only to wake up to find roadkill in their beds.

Soon they pickup a gorgeous hitchhiker named Sarah and the two temporarily forget the crazed truck driver and compete for the affections of Sarah.  Adam wins and soon loses his virginity to his hot passenger but the interlude is short as the monster truck is on them again.  With the car destroyed they now find themselves having to flee on foot.  But they buddies soon learn there is more to this 'Monster Man' in the monster truck than meets the eye.

Monster Man is a surprisingly effective little film.  The two leads Eric Jungman (Adam) and Justin Urich, nephew of the late Robert Urich (Harley) play off each other very well and their contrasting personalities remind me of David Spade and Chris Farley in Tommy Boy.  This leads to several funny moments such as their slap fight by the side of the road.  The humor elements call to mind such films as Return of the Living Dead as opposed to straight comedies like Scary movie.  Aimee Brooks as Sarah is very attractive although at almost 30, she may have been a bit too old to be playing this part which was cast as kind of a late teen or early 20's hitchhiker wanting to hit the road and get away from home.

It obviously borrows from many films as noted above, but does so pretty well.  There is a long lapse in action after the initial attack of the monster truck.  The guys find Sarah and fight over her and think they are relatively safe.  It's the only part where the film really bogs down.  It's filmed quite well from a technical standpoint.  The gore and special effects are gruesome and quite gory, but again in almost a Return of the Living Dead sort of way.  There's one memorable scene where Harley is in the backseat and discovers he's sharing it with a mangled corpse.  As Adam swerves to avoid the monster truck the corpse keeps sliding into Harley, much to his horror.

The DVD comes with a making of featurette as well as a gag reel.  All in all a pretty good film.  Call it 3 1/2 stars.",1113177600,,2810,4.5108910891089105
2117318,5,B0002S94GQ,"I received this movie as a gift from someone who knows that I love horror movies that are so bad they are good.  The only thing was that this movie wasn't great for being so bad, but great for being a perfect mix of humour and horror.  I have no idea how director Michael Davis made this idea work...he just did. How unique. I really enjoyed the dialogue, most of all I enjoyed how the movie 'looked'.  It's a bit hard to explain, but in the scenes with the monster truck on the highway, there was just something different in the way it was filmed...there was something almost alive about the truck and the way it moved on the screen...the way it swerved and lurched forward. Interesting use of camera angles, depth and colors. Make no mistake...the humorous parts of this movie were deliberate...and the horror scenes were great too.  This movie was very well thought out...I am surprised for a 'straight to DVD' type release.  I am so impressed with Michael Davis I really would like to check out some of his other films...I hope he does more in the horror genre.  His success with this movie is all in the details.",1109548800,2,1117,4.477832512315271
2117319,3,B0002S94GQ,"This movie was pretty good.  I wouldn't consider it a horror movie since it was more like a comedy with horror elements; still it had a fair amount of blood.

Two guys who can't seem to quit bickering are traveling to another state to stop a wedding.  First they are stalked by a hearse then finally a ROAD WARRIOR-style monster truck that's driven by a large disfigured freak the two guys name F***face.  Things brighten up though when they pick up a hot hitchhiker named Sarah, but Old' F***face stays on their trail and next thing you know the three travelers are meeting F***face's clan up close and personal.

The first time I watched MONSTER MAN I really enjoyed it, but the second time around it was kind of lame.  The energy and humor did not hold up well at all.  Aimee Brooks was still sexy though, but sadly there is no nudity.",1108339200,5,838,4.437908496732026

Even my significant other, who normally hates watching horror films with me, thought this film was so outrageous that she looked at me a few times and said ""OMG, are you serious"" and then laughed her face off. One of most hilarious horror comedies I've seen in quite sometime. It's very immature, over-the-top, and fairly gory. Of course I loved every minute of it.

Two bro's go on an road trip across country so one can tell his ex-girlfriend that he still loves her. On the way they are greeted by a deformed beast that attempts to run them off the road in a monster truck. He continues his attacks until one of them finds himself at the family home of the beast alongside his insane family.

This movie is so bonkers and depraved in so many areas. You have hints of incest, a bestiality scene with a dead and rotten cat (probably the funniest scene I've ever witnessed), and a beast who's lips is wired halfway shut and walks with a limp. His family is equally messed up. While the acting isn't the greatest and can be borderline Sy-fy channel bad, the way it's told and done makes it a must watch.",1506988800,,1215,4.395555555555555
