8184629,5,B000OCY7H6,"Casper was created in the 30s by . Symour Reit & Joe Oriolo . I think there could be a spiritual message entwined with the cartoons biblically speaking in that it's a wide road down hence you have Stinkie, Stretch and Fatso always getting into mischief or causing trouble but Casper seems to be on the narrow road going up. These cartoons will always be classics.",1490140800,,363,4.515151515151516
