7891481,5,6305538581,"I bought this boxed set just for the key to vector sigma, but the other four episodes are great especially War dawn where you first see Orion Pax who later becomes Optimus Prime. If you have never watched transformers before then I wouldn't really buy this as unfortunatly it is just random episodes so on one video it is Rodimus Prime leading the Autobots and the next video it is back to Prime. So his is only for those who love transformers",1008374400,2,443,4.414634146341464
7891482,5,6305538581,"I like Transformers Volume 3 programmed for evil but there are too many mistakes. This video has two episodes from Season 2 of the Original American Transformers cartoon show. The first episode on this tape is ""Starscream's Brigade"". It features the first apperance of the Combaticons!  Starscream is cast out of the Decepticon army by Megatron! Starscream plots his revenge by stealing five personality components of the Renegade Decepticons. Renegade Decepticons were political prisoners who were detained and defied Megatron. Megatron had there personlities removed from there structures and were stored in a Decepticon Detention center. Starscream uses the personlity components to create his own army, The Combaticons!  In a human cermony dedicated in honor of Optimus Prime. Starscream and the combaticons attack the Optimus Prime memorial and kidnap Jazz and Cliffjumper. Will Optimus Prime be able to rescue Jazz and Cliffjumper from Starscream?!  Will Starscream be able to take leadership of the Decepticons from Megatron now that he has the combaticons to help him?! this video also has the first apperance of the Decepticon Gesalt, Bruticus!  Find out what happens next! Get the video!  Also in this video is ""AutoBeserk"", An episode about Red Alert and Inferno. There was a mistake from Rhino Home Video in packaging this video. The first thing is the Rodimus Prime is pictured on the front cover and does not appear on this video at all!  Rhino Home Video mistook that Transformers character for Red Alert who should have been illustrated on the package! The next mistake Rhino Home video made is that Starscream's Brigade is actually a two-part episode. the next episode, should have been the ""Revenge of Bruticus"" not AutoBeserk. It tells what happens after Starscream and the Combaticons were banished on that Astriod by Megatron.  dispite, those mistakes, I still recommend this video because it has two good episodes from Season 2 of the American Transformers cartoon series. Buy it!  A must have for all Children of the 1980s Generation!
PS: the Voice of Optimus Prime is Peter Cullen and Not Jack Angel!  Check the 1980's cartoon database!",995500800,3,2160,5.2017291066282425

7891484,5,6305538581,This video is great! It has the 2nd ep from the Transformers Generation 2 when red alert is confused.  Optimus Prime (aka) Jack Angel must get red  back to his own self while I tell prime that red alert might be back to his  own self. I hope they come out with Transformers Generation 2 or a Play  Back I'd love to see that,967852800,2,323,4.0

7891486,5,6305538581,"Original TF-G1 episodes have been hard to come by until recently. They've been available on-line now for about a year and a half from Sunbow Productions in Canada.  But now Sunbow and Kid Rhino are releasing this  classic in the United States. And they're available here at Amazon.com!  <--- web site plug :-) As far as the episode choice for Volume Three,  hmm... I think I like it. I think I like it a lot. Again both of these  episodes take place in season two, and they feature much of the best  elements notable in season two. Especially the introduction of new adjunct  teams... always a fan pleaser. :-)In ""Starscream's Brigade"",  Megatron, finally fed up with Starscreams antics, exiles him to a deserted  island. Starscream quickly discovers World War II military wreckage, which  he uses to build his own army of soldiers, stealing renegade Decepticon  sparks from Cybertron to give them life. Starscream leaves out an essential  component in their construction forcing them to obey him, and commands them  to assist him in defeating Megatron. This new adjunct team, the  Combaticons, has a merging ability just like the other adjunct teams.  Starscream and Megatron are both very much in character in this episode,  which also features an unprecendented battle between three super-robots,  Devastator, Bruticus and Menasor! In ""Auto Bersek"", Starscream is  once again left in the dust by Megatron, and he teams up with the  malfunctioning Red Alert of the protectobots. Red Alert's circuits have  given Red extreme dimensia and paranoia, and he joins Starscream in an  attempt to steal a new and powerful autobot weapon. This volume is the  perfect mix of character focus and fan pleasing, with gigantic robot  battles, great character continuity and profiles of the Autobots' sense of  community, and the Decepticons' lack thereof. Highly recommended for  purchase here at Amazon.com. I can't wait for the next package. It features  three episodes I've been waiting to be released for a long time! Reviews  pending for volumes 4-6. If you've found my review here helpful, view my  other reviews about everything Transformers here on Amazom.com!",951523200,7,2156,5.117816091954023
7891487,5,6305538581,"This video has two episodes from the orginal ""Trnasfomers"". The video features the orginal ""Autobots""(good guys) and ""Deceptions"". The first episode is called ""Starscream's  Brigade"". It is about a power struggle between Megatron and  Starscream(both bad guys). Also in this episode Starscream creates the  ""Combaticons""(more Deceptions) . If you are fan of the series  that aired in the 1980's , you will love this video! I will not review the  second episode as I want you to have fun with this video! Thank you Rhino  and Amazon for bringing back this great series! Now bring back the rest of  the series! The sooner the better!",943747200,5,631,4.9523809523809526
