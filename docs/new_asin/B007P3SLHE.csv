5102471,5,B007P3SLHE,"Just finished watching this film a couple minutes ago. The cinematography is beautiful, as is the location and the music. There are times when the story feels cut, as if scenes have been deleted in editing, so I would like to see an extended version, but the story is solid. The characters are believable, and the romance doesn't include the bedroom, but happens outside it, in the subtleties of everyday life. Definitely adding this one to my video library.",1370304000,4,458,4.810126582278481
5102472,4,B007P3SLHE,"The movie was shot on location around Shangri-la in the Yunnan Province of China.  So the movie has some nice scene.  The leading actor and actress are among the most popular movie stars at the time.  However, the story is weak and some acting is just not realistic.  This movie is the sequel to another movie of the same theme but not yet made.  Go figures here.  I enjoyed it anyway, just to watch movie made by these two stars.  This is not that best movie in my opinion.",1369872000,,474,4.258426966292135
5102473,3,B007P3SLHE,"This film has two amazing actors to deliver a promising drama, but the story is a bit dull. It wasn't a complete waste of time, but I wouldn't watch it again.",1368576000,,158,4.129032258064516
5102474,5,B007P3SLHE,"If you're reading this review it's probably because you are trying to decide if you should watch this. I invested my 2 hours and felt like it was well worth it. It's a wonderfully written and acted romance movie from China. In my opinion just as good as anything coming out of Hollywood these days (at least as far as romance/love story type movies.)

Interesting story: Man on the rebound falls for the the grieving 'never gives up hope' woman not willing to admit she's a widow yet. They help each other with their emotional demons and fall in love, but have to overcome so many roadblocks to get there.

Well acted, sympathetic characters,  all in all pretty good. No sex, violence, cursing or nudity. Just drama and romance. 2 hankie ending.",1367107200,5,745,4.628787878787879
5102475,5,B007P3SLHE,Beautiful story-line. Made me cry at the end.  Losing love and the beauty of finding it again.  Definitely a 5 star movie!,1366329600,2,122,4.5
5102476,4,B007P3SLHE,"This movie snuck up on me. It showed how time does not heal all wounds but closure can start the healing process. Filmed in a part of the world I know very little about - Shangri-La - it explores life where oxygen is thin, the forest a menacing place where it's easy to get lost, the difference between public and private personas, grief and healing, friendship and love. Lovely movie.",1390176000,2,385,4.514285714285714
5102477,5,B007P3SLHE,I loved this movie and the  music! The actors were wonderful..The storyline is one that I have not ever seen..Brillant!! Beautiful love story all around...,1390176000,,155,5.2
5102478,5,B007P3SLHE,This is a great love story. More and more I am appreciating and watching Asian film and tv. This will pull you in and keep your interest until the last moment ... each character was very well developed and was suspenseful throughout ... enjoy!,1389657600,,243,4.545454545454546
5102479,1,B007P3SLHE,i don't think it a serious movie at all. i was misled by its previous rating and a big disappointment.,1388966400,,102,4.15
5102480,3,B007P3SLHE,Watchable for those who like Asian cinema and interesting view of Shangri la. However overly simplistic story and stretches credibility.  Handsome main characters.,1387929600,,163,6.086956521739131
5102481,5,B007P3SLHE,The only thing that would make this show better would be if it was done in English. And maybe some of the acting. My husband and I enjoyed watching this show. It was sweet and innocent without bad language or sex with a completely unexpected ending.,1383868800,,249,4.434782608695652
5102482,5,B007P3SLHE,This movie was very moving and touching. I loved the entire cast and the lead characters were beautiful as well as the scenery. I find this to be a must watch movie and will put the word out to family and friends. I'm giving it a Thumbs Up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1380931200,,257,4.375
5102483,5,B007P3SLHE,"I've been on a kick of Johnnie To's movies for a while now, and romantic films as well, and I have to say that this is one of the best in both of those categories. While at times you forget about To's direction due to the lack of gunfights and gangsters (or at least I did), when you look for it you can see all of his carefully developed skills at play. The film plays out beautifully against a backdrop suited perfectly for the story. You are drawn into a world apart from our own, as Louis Koo's character is, and at the end of the film you are sad to leave it behind. The romance blossoms as naturally as it should for the respective characters, with nothing ever feeling forced or ""too good to be true."" Definitely a good watch, and something romantics out there would fall head over heels for, as I did.",1378684800,,809,4.225806451612903
5102484,3,B007P3SLHE,"Sort of slow, something for a Sunday afternoon when you have nothing to do, then watch this to kill time.",1373500800,,105,4.3
5102485,5,B007P3SLHE,"Great Johnnie To film.  Super plot with very good characterizations by great actors.  As usual with Johnnie To, good ending but not quite what you're expecting.",1372550400,3,160,5.115384615384615
8520091,4,B007P3SLHE,Sammi and Louis always make a great team..,1418688000,,42,4.375
8520092,3,B007P3SLHE,"This was quite a decent love story. It is not a mad passionate romance, but moves slowly and one is not quite sure how it will turn out. I loved the inn and the scenery was beautiful. Snow is certainly more romantic than a rain storm when one is outside. It was a relaxing movie. The fact that the actors are quite attractive didn't hurt the plot either. I enjoyed it.",1401753600,,368,4.197183098591549
8520093,5,B007P3SLHE,"Good acting, good story, beautiful scenery all add up to an enjoyable movie.  I have watched it several times and each time I see the plot unfold a little deeper.  I envy those who can view this in their first language for I'm sure the subtitles fall of bit short of the actual meaning of every phrase.  All the same, quite good.",1401062400,,329,4.274193548387097
8520094,4,B007P3SLHE,"Didn't know what to expect but pleasantly surprised, was drawn in by the story, loved that there was no violence, cursing, and had great scenery and acceptable acting with a surprise ending. I'd rate it 4.5 stars.",1399248000,,213,4.783783783783784
8520095,4,B007P3SLHE,"Wow, this totally caught me by surprise. There are a very satisfying amount of layers to this film. It is well shot, well acted, and made my Thursday night a lot better than it would have been otherwise! Give it a chance!",1398902400,,221,4.285714285714286
8520096,3,B007P3SLHE,"The scene is beautiful, actors performed great.  A little bit slow, have to be patient to follow the story.  Actually you can imagine the end of the story.",1395100800,,155,4.5
8520097,3,B007P3SLHE,"In one sense, the script here is well written. Each scene has later significance, with nothing gratuitous or even merely entertaining. That's because it was obviously written back to front, with an idea for an ending guiding everything else. This is a common scheme in writing fiction.

However, despite this seemingly professional competence, to me this was not a satisfying movie. The central character is the woman whose name is here translated to Sue. The initial objective should have been to make us care for her and her anguishing circumstance. Instead, the writer distracts us with an unnecessary story about how the leading male character was left at the altar, with subsequent alcoholic remorse. The reason why it was written this way is also obvious -- the story is a film-maker's fantasy with himself as the main character.

I also found the camera work and direction disappointing. The actress who played Sue has an attractive and expressive face. One way to develop sympathy for Sue would have been to have let the actress's face occasionally fill the frame, even briefly, so that we might have wondered at the cause and depth of her feelings.",1393891200,,1157,4.958762886597938
8520098,5,B007P3SLHE,This movie is brilliant. It keeps it nice and simple shows you a great love story that holds both despair and happiness. Unlike Korean drama that seem to have a outrageous amount of love drama that just make it to much this one was just great. I highly recommend it to you all if your looking for a nice little movie.,1392508800,,317,4.213114754098361
8520099,2,B007P3SLHE,"Amateur style, I thought this director is good, maybe he's only good at action movies. The first  5 minutes already wanted to stop until 15 mins I really stop watching it.",1391385600,,171,4.516129032258065
8520100,5,B007P3SLHE,"Great match of actors ! Love them both! Supporting actors were great as well. Just a great story! Location was excellent for story line, couldn't have better. Thanks!",1391040000,,166,4.964285714285714
