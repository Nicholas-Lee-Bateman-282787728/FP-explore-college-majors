8651998,2,B00JKTFQO2,A long way from being classics...  The only good movie out of the bunch is the  Colony ...  normally these 4 movie collections are decent but not this one !!,1516579200,,157,4.166666666666667

8652003,2,B00JKTFQO2,"Gattaca fan may won't to pass on buying this item.  I failed to look up the other movies on IMDB and unfortunately assumed they would be close to the quality of Gattaca.  But where as Gattaca is rated over 7/10 the others are 5/10, 3/10, & 3/10.  Not a bad deal though if you would like, for a few extra dollars, some bad Sci-Fi to go with a classic Sci-Fi.",1404518400,12,357,4.071428571428571
