2278393,5,B0009DOH7U,"By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com

This DVD includes two of the most successful short films ever made, and a classic Pearl Buck Christmas story. Before videocassettes and DVD's, these five films sold on 16mm for a total of $1,350, and clients were pleased to buy them at that price. Now you can have all five for less than $20. What a deal! The cover says, ""LDS Film Classics"" but don't worry about them being Mormon or religious propaganda. They were produced by Brigham Young University for the world. Not one of the five films even has the word 'Christ,' 'Mormon,' or 'LDS' in it.

The story of 'Cipher in the Snow' was told and reviewed eloquently by the other 5 Star reviewer. With over 6,000 copies sold, 'Cipher in the Snow' may be the most successful short film ever made. A few years ago you couldn't find a teacher in the U.S. (public, parochial, or private) that had not seen and been touched by Jean Mizer's moving story that took place in Haley, Idaho. Not only was 'Cipher' bought by virtually every school district but by every major religious denomination. The American Lutheran Church Headquarters film Library in Minneapolis MN owned 56 copies of 'Cipher in the Snow' and they were booked months in advance.

'Cipher in the Snow' received the CINE Golden Eagle Award in Washington DC (films chosen to officially represent the U.S. in International Film Festivals). 'Cipher' represented the U.S. in the Ninth International Moscow Film Festival that I attended. The director of the Gorky Studios (largest motion picture studio in the world) who didn't speak English, put his hands on my shoulders and said twice, ""YOU HAVE A GOOT GOOT FILM, YOU HAVE A GOOT GOOT FILM!"" Ila Frez, the Steven Spielberg of Russian Cinema, gave me a personal award for 'Cipher in the Snow.'

The motion picture 'The Gift' is based on one of the most beloved and memorable, classic stories of Pearl Buck. No other film shows the love of a boy for his father better than this.

John Baker's Last Race also won a 'CINE Golden Eagle Award.' It is the inspiring true story of a great athlete and teacher that figuratively gave his life for his students (little ones.) Sound familiar? Viewers love the film (without thinking of this) because it harkens back to another teacher in another age. John Baker's last Race is based on the most popular story ever printed in the Reader's Digest (by the number of reprints that were ordered, see comments). Like 'Cipher in the Snow,' JBLR was shown to most of the students in the U.S. and it was also bought by every major religious denomination. It was voted the most popular film in a poll that was taken at the Baptist Sunday School Board Film Library in Nashville TN. I appeared there with John Baker's mother, at the Southern Baptist World Headquarters, where we were graciously hosted to a luncheon. Mormons, Baptists, and John Baker's mother who was a Methodist, came together in a spirit of love.

Christians coming together brings me to a Baptist motion picture ""Truce In the Forest"" (also available from amazon.com) produced by the Baptist Sunday School Board, which I believe is unquestionably one of the best short films ever made. It is a true story from the Battle of the Bulge in World War 11. Men who were killing each other in the war were accidentally brought together on a Christmas Eve and spent the night together in a Germain farm house. Through that Holy Night, and through the miracle of service, men who were killing each other just hours before, came to feel an unbelievable love for their enemies.

We learn from 'Truce in the Forest' that we can even love our enemies, if we pray for them, serve them, and do good to them. This is a lesson taught by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount that eludes most Christians even to this day. When have you ever heard a prayer for Al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hamas, Hezbollah, or for Muslim Terrorists?

2278394,5,B0009DOH7U,"Many years ago, when I was a high school psychology teacher, I ""accidentally"" ran across this incredible film (at that time it was a 16 mm. film) that has changed the lives for the better of many, many high school students who were prone to bullying/ignoring those students who were ""different"" from them. Told caringly but honestly, this life-altering little movie depicts the extreme consequence of people not caring for other people's feelings.  I still get ""goosebumps"" when I think about this wonderful lesson-teaching movie and the effect it has had not only on MY own life (as a psychotherapist I've seen what bullying can do to kids)but on the hundreds of 15, 16, 17 and 18 year olds who enrolled voluntarily into my ""experimental"" psychology class.  There were no chairs or desks in my classroom...a portable...and the students sat on the floor for 50 minutes, five days a week (grudgingly at first because whoever heard of affluent kids not having the comforts of a desk!),learned to share their feelings and respect the feelings of others, explored values and how our adult lives would be shaped on learning about good values as teens, and studied life and death as subjects to be investigated rather than things that just ""happened"" to us. Even the football players were brought to tears as this little film uncovers and explores a situation that no one would ever want to think they were took part. There is no particularly religious bent to this film.  The scenario simply investigates a premise that we all KNOW we should exercise:  be good and caring to everyone you meet because you affect everyone whose path you cross. If your child is being bullied (ignored or otherwise), purchase this dvd and show it to your child's school principal.

THEN, be in attendance when that same principal calls the entire school together to watch ""Cipher in the Snow.""  You'll understand firsthand why this little film is too good to be rated...there simply isn't a scale  on which to rate what it teaches.",1306195200,12,3764,4.874804381846635
2278415,4,B0009DOH7U,I haven't received this as yet but have seen this before and so I felt that it was worth having in our family dvd collection.  Wholesome films are getting much more difficult to find these days and I feel their importance is most valuable in our lives.,1403308800,,252,4.361702127659575
2278416,5,B0009DOH7U,"Cipher in the snow is about a boy, Cliff Evans, who is slowly ""erased"" so much by everyone around him that his heart suddenly stops beating and what his favorite teacher Mr. Collier learns as he tries to write an obit about the boy whom he barely remembered.  Every teacher and school administrator should see it.  IT is NOT preachy at all.

The Gift has as young boy Sam and his father Tav in lead roles.  Tav is always getting after Sam to do his chores.... Christmas Eve comes and Sam wants to give his father something special, not just a tie.  As he goes to bed, he gets the idea to get up before his father and do all the chores for both of them so his father can enjoy Christmas with the whole family and see the kids open their Christmas gifts.  Sam gets up without being prompted and does each chore right, and from the heart.  To Tav, it is a gift he will treasure for a lifetime and he is even more pleased that Sam has done EVERY chore perfectly.",1387843200,3,958,4.173913043478261
2278417,5,B0009DOH7U,This DVD was discontinued but I found it on Amazon.  It is a classic and it came promply.  Cost a little more but that is okat.,1387411200,,127,3.8461538461538463
2278418,5,B0009DOH7U,I saw this when I was in 7th grade and never forgot it. I think everyone could benefit from watching this. Very good.,1379462400,,117,4.130434782608695
2278419,5,B0009DOH7U,Don't let the fact that these films were produced by the Mormon church.  They are very outstanding moral stories and although rather old now they are still very usable in motivational settings.  I use them at youth camps in training the counselors.,1376524800,,248,4.880952380952381
2278420,5,B0009DOH7U,I had been looking for this film for years.  Cipher in the Snow was played during a teacher in service at my school years ago.  It left a lasting and profound impression on me and shaped my goals and aspirations as an educator and parent.  Children are our future.  This film demonstrates that each of us has an opportunity and an obligation to get involved.,1370908800,,358,4.461538461538462
2278421,5,B0009DOH7U,I have watched John Baker's Last Race and the Emmott Smith story probably 50 times going up.  I was wonderful to see them again.  I still love the message.,1370390400,,155,4.310344827586207
2278422,5,B0009DOH7U,"Although the acting is amateurish, the message is timeless and, perhaps, even more appropriate for the present than when it was produced.  The story always brings me to tears.

This film should be required viewing for every middle school and high school student!",1359504000,,262,5.069767441860465
2278423,5,B0009DOH7U,"it was wonderful finding this movie, the delivery was very fast, the quality of the movie was wonderful, it was great having multiple movies on the one DVD",1342051200,4,155,4.571428571428571
2278424,4,B0009DOH7U,"My mother who is a retired schoolteacher remembers Cipher in the Snow being shown to a group of teachers over 25 years ago. If something has that sort of impact, it's got to be good. It's a little dated but still effective nonetheless. The other movies on the DVD vary in the quality of acting, but if you need a lighthearted tale of another wimpy kid against a bully, The Phone Call will do the trick.",1334448000,5,402,4.302631578947368
8059121,1,B0009DOH7U,Great short films. It was weird I live 15 miles from the distribution center in Utah and the dvd was flown all the way to new jersey and back. I would have been better to go two minutes away to the local lds store.,1521676800,,214,3.8863636363636362
8059122,5,B0009DOH7U,"A great film, and though filmed many years ago, it carries a needed message for our day.  I am pleased to own a copy of the film and will show it whenever I get the chance.  The film arrived earlier than anticipated.  Well pleased.",1478908800,,231,4.204545454545454

8059124,4,B0009DOH7U,Very good,1459123200,,9,4.0
8059125,4,B0009DOH7U,Good for educators to see.,1458518400,,26,4.4
8059126,5,B0009DOH7U,"I saw the first one, which is the title, in school, 50 years ago, and never forgot it.  After I figured out how to spell ""ciper"", then I could search for it and buy it, finally.

It's a bit over done with the drama, in a way some people would moan,  but if you get past that, the message is strong.  People need to feel cared about and it's easy to be invisible in our culture.  Add the bullying problem, and it's understandable why some kids have a very hard time, and many adults still carry the scars, and sometimes continued rejection, their whole life.

These were made in the '60's, so cut them some slack....our presentation style is very different now.

They all are a bit like some Disney movies we all love, way to happy for real life, but good to watch.

There are good messages to each one, like values infomercials.",1434931200,,828,4.3311688311688314
8059127,4,B0009DOH7U,Very dated but good message.  Used in my classroom.,1433548800,,51,4.666666666666667
8059128,5,B0009DOH7U,Loved these films and arrived quickly,1432080000,,37,5.333333333333333
8059129,4,B0009DOH7U,Some I remember from years back but some I had never seen - great family learning short movies with lessons to learn.,1420329600,,117,4.363636363636363
8059130,5,B0009DOH7U,Been wanting this for a long time,1418947200,,33,3.857142857142857
