Although its translation into English adds a  hokey air and a few chuckles due to some rather clumsy dialog, special  effects (not high tech) and a generally good story line make this an  interesting and highly entertaining film.

951946,4,6304953585,"An unusual film with a sad history of crummy public domain (PD) releases finally gets a decent quality treatment from the Wade Williams collection. PLEASE BE ADVISED... if you have a Blu-ray player, the picture will only take up the middle 2/3 of your screen, as it is an older release. Even so, the picture & sound are quite good, especially compared to the washed out garbage copies we were all forced to live with prior to this release. This edition features vivid colors, solid blacks, a fairly sharp focus, and a pretty clean sound mix from the old mono US dub.

Hopefully one day all of these WW Collection films will be remastered onto Hi-Def Blu-ray for an even more improved picture (and one the actually fills up the whole screen). Until then, even ""small"" the film is watchable and pretty entertaining if you're an old school sci-fi aficionado like me.

951951,5,6304953585,"Great Americanized, English-dubbed version of a European film called The Silent Star.  A bunch of scientists (all from different countries) decipher some kind of message from space and deduce that it comes from Venus from a long time back.  Realizing that there is intelligent life on the second planet they gather an expedition of these same scientists and decide to schlepp up there to meet their interplanetary brethren.  Once they arrive they find a dead ruined world blasted by a nuclear holocaust that was intended for Earth. The Venusians are long gone but their machinery is still active and still a threat to the third planet.  Beautiful spaceship and the nuclear blasted Venusian landscape is eerie and properly alien looking.  I bought the Image Entertainment DVD-R widescreen version and the quality and color are excellent.  Of the American versions this is the one to get.

952061,1,6304953585,"""First Spaceship on Venus"" is something as strange as a dubbed American version of a science fiction film made in the Soviet bloc, a Polish-East German co-production, to be exact. This explains the Soviet-style look of the film, the Soviet-style look of the actors (one of them reminds me of Romanian Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, although admittedly he was anti-Soviet!), and - above all - the Soviet-style message.

An international team of cosmonauts land on Venus, only to discover that the planet's civilization has destroyed itself through nuclear weapons, after a failed attempt to attack and conquer Earth. I think it's obvious that ""Venus"" is an allegory for NATO, while ""Earth"" symbolizes the Soviet Union and its satellite states. A more charitable interpretation is that ""Venus"" symbolizes the mad arms race. However, the fact that the Venusians want to attack Earth points to a NATO interpretation. To give the film more suspense, the machines of the Venus imperialists have survived their demise, attacking the peaceful cosmonauts.

So why only one star? Don't get me wrong, I also want peace, ha ha. No, the main problem with ""First Spaceship on Venus"" (or, to use its original German title, ""Der schweigende Stern"") is that it's so bloody boring. But sure, it feels strangely reassuring that they made B-movies even in the Eastern bloc. Perhaps there is common ground across the Berlin Walls of the future, after all...

952064,2,6304953585,"An adaptation of one of Stanislaw Lem's novels... it's going to be good, right? Sadly, no.

Instead, ""First Spaceship To Venus -- a poorly dubbed, severely-cut version of the German/Polish film ""Der schweigende Stern"" -- ends up being a very long, dull sci-fi movie that is difficult to pay attention to for any length of time. Wooden acting, a ponderous script and a general air of pretention... no wonder Lem disowned it.

The year is 1985 (as imagined in 1960), and a mysterious message is found in the Gobi Desert, which apparently came from the Tunguska explosion in Siberia. I may not be an expert in geography, but I'm pretty sure that's impossible. So scientists somehow figure out that the messages came from the planet Venus (I guess they didn't know about the acid rain and toxic atmosphere then) and that the Tunguska ""meteor"" was actually a spaceship that crashed.

So while an Indian scientist tries to decode the message, an international crew is assembled to go to Venus aboard the Cosmokrator. But of course, it's discovered that the Venusians want to kill all of humanity and steal our planet (presumably because it's so much nicer and less toxic than theirs) -- and the danger hasn't gone with them.

I tried. I really did. But I simply could not pay attention for very long while watching ""First Spaceship to Venus"" -- and unfortunately, I don't think that the cut footage would have improved matters. There are some promising moments in the story, mostly centering around the creepy Venusian landscape and the automated machines left behind.

But despite the promise, the movie just sort of oozes along, peppered with incredibly naive viewpoints on war (one guy pompously announces that nobody on Earth will panic if told ""The Venusians want to kill us all!""?). The dialogue is leaden (""We are all fascinated by the petrified forest,"" said in a dead voice), and too much time is spent on a cutesy robot playing chess. And there are some gaping plot holes -- there's a guy with air leaking out of his spacesuit... and everybody tries to keep him TALKING which would waste even more oxygen.

And unfortunately none of the actors are very good -- there's a lame attempt at character depth by pairing Yoko Tani's melodramatic doctor with G&uuml;nther Simon's woodenly heroic pilot, but we never know much about their past romance. Honestly, the only character who was in any way endearing is Tang Hua-Ta's Chinese linguist, mainly because he's played by one of the few competent actors. As for the dubbing... it's awful. Simply awful.

""First Spaceship on Venus"" has impressive (for its time) special effects and some interesting action, but it also has a sluggish pace and wooden acting. Sometimes a curiosity, but it's pretty boring.",1276560000,2,2752,4.8927038626609445
952065,5,6304953585,"First off, this film is still and always be one of the best and most overlooked SF films from its period. This print is quite decent, and better than most of the others I've seen, but I would still like to have a fully restored version some day.

Sadly, for the folks wishing for a 130 minute version, there never was one. The original Eastern Bloc release was a little longer, but the additional footage was of little consequence, mostly being from the earth-bound prologue and mostly composed of longer establishing shots, etc., etc.",1276387200,2,535,4.691489361702128
952066,2,6304953585,"This DVD is in need of cleaning up. The images are quite blurry, out of focus and the color seems to be washed out quite a bit. It was probably pulled from a VHS at one point or from very old and un-kept 35mm reals, the transfer was not entirely successful. The story itself is different though. It does become 'long running' after a while. They do have one of the coolest looking spaceships I have ever seen in a SciFi movie though, I have to give them that.",1273190400,2,459,4.168539325842697
952067,4,6304953585,"There are so many versions of this film it is quite confusing, so let me try to clarify a little. Firstly, this review relates to this product:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Spaceship-on-Venus/dp/B00005A0PZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Spaceship on Venus</a>. Secondly, this dvd is not Region 1 only, as it plays perfectly happily on my Region 2, UK only dvd player, so it must be at least Region 1+2 or Region 0 (no mention on the case). Thirdly, the cover details give it a Rated 13 badge. Fourthly, this is a 1.33:1 format, 79 minute version. Fifthly, it is produced by Platinum Disc LLC (Now owned by Echo Bridge).

In addition, the box claims that it is digitally mastered, although this appears to mean that a very old, unrestored print was transferred to a digital medium and then to disc with no noticeable removal of dust or correction for scratches, etc. The image is rather fuzzy also. Interactive Menus and Chapter Selections are listed as DVD Features and these do work as expected, however what is not mentioned is the Quiz. This is a five question Special Feature, which charmingly tests whether you were paying attention when you watched the movie!

Although the sound is dubbed your brain soon adapts and you stop noticing it as the story develops and the tension mounts. The sound effects are quite extraordinary and must have been all created using valve equipment. This is evident in their particular tonal quality. The story is lent weight by the age of the scientists, their seriousness of intent, the hazards encountered and the anti-war/anti-nuclear message. A combination of serious message, dramatic orchestration of the incidental music and sound effects, and the menacingly alien landscapes makes this quite an intense experience.

There are two fascinating contrasts with the way things are done today: the language and personal interactions between the scientists are remarkably formal, yet the way they casually refer to and use dangerous technology would be not possible with today's risk assessments and safety protocols (with good reason).

Many other reviewers have commented positively on the marvellous set designs for the ship interiors and its unusual outward appearance, the chess-playing robot, multi-racial crew, incredibly alien landscape devised for Venus, etc. I heartily agree: a highly imaginative, earnest, well-intentioned and thoroughly moral tale.",1263513600,2,2453,5.481481481481482
952068,3,6304953585,"I will confess right off the bat that I saw the movie as part of Mystery Science Theater's famously amusing talk-back-to-the-screen dvd.  And I will tell you that this movie wasn't the best choice for them, because it was pretty darn good.  There were a few funny jabs, but the MST3K crowd was silent more often than not.

Other reviewers have noted the multi-racial cast.  I must admit seeing an African, several Asian, and other presumably third-world actors was what you'd expect to see in 2009, not 1960.

The movie was refreshingly light on the 'horrible, badly-sculpted evil monster threatening the American damsel in distress' films one associates with the 50s and 60s science fiction movie.

The movie wasn't at all predictable.  That was novel and welcome.  You never see the aliens, because of a plot development that others have pointed out (without, I notice, including a spoiler alert).  The crew was realistically puzzled at times, and didn't break out the death ray gun to blast first, and ask questions second, as is all to often in this kind of movie.  There was more talk and less action than one is accustomed to.

The special effects are just OK, perhaps better than average for the time period.  They don't hold up well compared with today's movies or even television (the effects of the mid- to late- 60 Star Trek were better than seen here), but they get the point across.

Recommended, especially once you get past the anachronistic special effects.",1245974400,3,1473,4.844
952069,2,6304953585,"This version is so chopped up that it's difficult to tell what's going on. I can't help thinking that there might have been an interesting movie in there, but between the awkward dubbing into English and the abrupt jumps in scenes, it's just too difficult to follow to be really fun.

An attempt at scientific accuracy (for what was known in 1959) seems to have been attempted in the first few minutes of the movie, but as it goes on it gets increasingly wacky; losing any pretense of being hard science fiction. It's visually interesting at points; that's about all it has going for it. It does get points for the interracial crew and a decent spaceship. But it's hard to recommend this one, overall.",1244937600,2,701,4.608

952132,3,6304953585,"Yeah, that should be the real title of this turkey -- I've read where this is a German/Polish foreign film, 1959.  The story happens in the 1980s where we have a space station on the moon and we all live in peaceful harmony, which makes for a boring passage on board this ship.  No one is a real hero, and although there are hints of a love triangle, nothing materializes there either.

I did like the take on the Venusians -- a civilization that was  on the brink of atomizing the Earth, but something went wrong and they blew themselves up instead.  Whew!

Cute little ""R2D2"" type robot that plays chess but has no heart.  He even warns of danger, danger (no Will Robinson here, however).

An international multi-racial team, quite unusual in that time period. At the end, their ship is being subjected to extreme gravity since they accidentally turned back on the atomic whachamacallit (OOPS) -- two guys go back to turn it off and a third comes to rescue them, but then something else goes horribly wrong -- you get the idea.

Special effects are pretty good -- straight-flying rocket, meteor storm (why is there always a meteor storm and a spacewalk in all these??) and so on.  Eerie clouds and storms on the formaldehyde surface of Venus...OOOOH>>>

The dubbing was passable and the story plodding along.  Rocketship XM was made at about the same time and is the superior scifi. The story is based on the writings of Stanislaus Lem, more noted for the film adaption of his story Solaris.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Solaris-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00006L92F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Solaris - Criterion Collection</a>

952135,4,6304953585,"There are two different versions of this film available from Amazon: FIRST SPACESHIP ON VENUS from Image Entertainment/The Wade Williams Collection (letterboxed 2.35:1, 78 minutes) and SILENT STAR from First Run Features (non-letterboxed full-screen 1.33:1, 95 minutes.) Too bad there isn't a 95-minute letterboxed version!

I own only the Image Entertainment disc. The image transfer is pretty good, though it's not a restored print. The package mentions that it was shot in Technicolor, which I imagine was the old, beautiful 3-strip process, as European filmmakers continued to use the format after Hollywood switched to single-negative film. The color on the DVD is faithful and well-saturated for the most part.

The production values are first-rate; this was no low-budget quickie. The very realistic scenes of the actors with the futuristic rocket on the launch pad are some of the best examples of large-scale miniatures and forced-perspective sets that I've ever seen in a film. A great deal of attention was paid to scientific detail as well. There's even a Rover-like robotic explorer that aids the astronauts--quite prescient for 1962. It even plays chess (an interesting prelude to HAL-9000 in Kubrick's 2001.)

Once the heroes land on Venus, we're treated to a totally surrealistic, downright bizarre world, with images that almost defy an ability to even understand what they represent. What makes it all the more creepy is that the film doesn't try to explain this odd world; the imagery just sort of washes over you--and the characters in the film!--like a bad dream. Very reminiscent of abstract sci-fi book cover illustrations of the time. That's one of the definite high-notes of this film...an alien planet that actually LOOKS and FEELS alien.

As mentioned by others, the acting is rather wooden, not helped by the very matter-of-fact script; the film almost comes across as a sort of propaganda-like documentary. But strangely, that doesn't detract from the film as a whole. Yes, the pace is rather plodding; but there's no ""filler"" here, no unnecessary scenes. The slow pace actually helps make the film the ""serious"" piece it was meant to be.

Buy it not for the acting, or even the script, but for the amazing imagery. This is one of those films that I saw as a youngster that burned some indelible images into my brain. Glad to have a letterboxed version, even if it IS trimmed down in length.",1206835200,5,2420,5.085642317380352

The St Clair Vision release is the 80 minute version, not a 130 minute version, despite what the DVD box says and despite what Amazon says.  Amazon should correct their information and give some grief to the distributor.  I'm returning the DVD as I already have the shorter version in other collections.  I'd give the film itself a higher rating - I appreciate it for where it was coming from at the time and, frankly, as camp fun - so this rating is based soley on the false advertising.",1201478400,6,716,4.435114503816794
952137,4,6304953585,"I saw this as a very young boy with my dad, right when it came out.  All I remembered are a few images:  the sharpened nacelles of the ship, the lone black man running towards the departing ship, the fall of the hero into a room full of bouncing metallic bugs.  As I put this on to watch with my son, I expected it to be pure, cheesy camp to be shared and laughed at.

However, what I discovered is that the film has not only a sophisticated plot, but great themes in it as well.  As with all great scifi, there is a potentially deadly mystery to be solved:  the meaning of the message discovered and the nature (and intent) of the civilization from which it came.  To answer these questions, a team of the top scientific minds take off for Venus, the apparent place of origin.  Dodging metorites and bravely plugging ahead even after they translate the terrifying message, they find a planet that is as alien as the civilization that marked it.  It is a truly weird landscape, including apparently intelligent mud, memory devices that look like ants, and an incomprehensible power system for the mysteriously missing venutians.  SLowly, they decifer only part of the mystery, leaving the rest to the imagination of the audience - another mark of all great scifi.

An additional treat is that this is an East German production, made at the height of the Cold War, with a vision of peace, international cooperation, and the beginning of a new era of exploration of space.  It was quite inspiring.

Needless to say, this was a bit over the head of my son (8) as it was for me in 1962.  But he enjoyed the images, the joking intelligent tank-shaped computer, and wondered about the nationalities of the team members.  We had fun watching and then discussing it.  This is far better as scifi than the kill-'em monster films of the era.

""First Spaceship on Venus"", an apparently hacked up version of an East German picture that was double billed in the States with ""Assignment: Outer Space"", certainly challenged your humble corrospondant to ward off the sandman's call on occasion. The story revolves around a group of scientists who travel to Venus  in search of answers. Answers to what, Tom? Glad you asked. Seems that what was previously thought to be a meteorite crash in Siberia was actually a spaceship from Venus. Seeing as this was, oh, almost eighty years before ""FSOV"" takes place, the silence from the morining star picques the curiousity of the whole planet. En route, the scientists decipher a scroll recovered from the crash site and find that those Venusians were up to their old invade/conquer Earth tricks again. Seriously. do Venusians ever come in peace? These guys are bad news, I tell ya. And oh do our cosmonauts ever find those answers they were looking for...and they portend a dark future for Earth under the shadow of nuclear weapons. Of course the filmmakers had to kill off the token Black cosmonaut. Figures.

The special effects were also quite good on Venus, although the ""wire work"" on the ship was clearly visible.  The voice over dubbing was also done very well.  What surprised me was the ethnic balance of the crew. Besides the four white Russian men, there was a black man serving as communications officer, an asian man as an astrobiologist, and an asian woman as the ships' Doctor!  This was 1962, when most women on spaceships worked in the galley to serve the men sandwiches and coffee.  There was also an American Astronaut aboard, working alongside the Russians!

SPOILERS AHEAD:

The bad part, however, was I just knew the black man wasn't going to make it back alive, and I was right.  For some reason they also had to kill off the Asian man and the American, though they allowed the Asian woman to survive.  I guess the Russians weren't all bad.

952234,2,6304953585,"You never know when you watch a movie like this exactly what you are going to get.  With another Venusian film, ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet,"" I was pleasantly surprised.  With this movie, my pleasure was measurably less.

In the future from 1959, when this movie was made, a spool is found in Tunguska, Siberia.  In the summer of 1908, something caused a huge explosion in Siberia that has been credited to a number of sources.  Though the current scientific explanation is that a meteor caused the explosion, this movie credits the explosion to a Venusian spaceship.  Scientists decipher a portion of the spool and learn that the spool provides data about the earth, and the source of the spool is Venus.  Off we go to Venus!

The earth spaceship is one of the best parts of this movie.  There are flying ribs that connect the spaceship's engines to the main portion of the ship.  The ship's takeoff impressed me.  Once the ship took off, things were not so impressive.  There was a cheesy meteor shower that other movies filmed pre-1959 handled better.  Once we got to Venus there were annoying cloud effects.  However, once on Venus the special effects picked up again.  The surface of Venus and some portions of the remains of the Venusian civilization were handled very nicely.  However, the central control was animated, and not well.

One of the most interesting effects occurs when a chocolate-looking substance begins to attack explorers, following them up a tower.  I wondered whether the syrupy concoction was some sort of ""blob"" equivalent that would digest the explorers when it reached them, but it did not.  One of the intrepid explorers shoots the gooey mess and it immediately retreats.  However, shooting into the gooey mess also begins a chain reaction.

The next thing you know, the spaceship is flung from the planet by the reversal of an energy field as the result of a heroic effort by two of the crew members, several people die, the spaceship returns to earth, the survivors say some high-minded stuff, and the movie is over.  Next, you wonder what that was all about.

Most of this movie, which was produced by East Germany and Poland, is boring.  There are brief moments that are fascinating, such as the introduction of a 1959 version of Roomba (seriously, there is a little robot that immediately reminded me of a Roomba, though it does not vacuum - it does talk and play chess well; top that Roomba!).  There are cool little gyro-vehicles and cars for tooling around the surface.  The space suits are right out of the Soviet space program.  The rest of the time the movie is a concatenation of stuff that makes a poor stew.  We learn that Dr. Sumiko Omigura's (Yoko Tani) husband was killed on the moon and that she had a fling with Robert Brinkman (Gnther Simon), one of the other explorers.  I suppose the intent was to give some depth to the characters, but instead I kept wondering why I should care about Omigura's husband and her fling.  I realized I did not care, but it was distracting me from the boring parts of the movie.

There are some movies that are interesting only to people who really, REALLY like science fiction, or those who are interested in the history of science fiction.  Also, if you want to see that movie that you vaguely remember having watched and you want to see how well it has held up compared to your memory, you might wish to watch it again.  Everyone else should go watch ""Forbidden Planet"" or even ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet.""",1139270400,3,3506,4.695081967213115
952235,2,6304953585,"This is the 80-minute version chopped for US distribution, not the 130-minute European version.  I can't blame Amazon - the DVD box clearly states ""running time 130 minutes,"" but the feature only runs 80 minutes and there is no other material on the disc.

*** Addendum:  I'm glad to see that Amazon reacted promptly to my review and changed the running time in the product description.  The story is a little herky-jerky in its shortened form, but the movie is still interesting for fans of old sci-fi, and some original plot elements almost compensate for the primitive special effects and stereotypical characters.

952236,5,6304953585,"Honestly, I love this film and have since the first time I saw it back in the Sixties. Anyone who's ever made a film (and most critics of these ""low budget"" films certainly haven't!) will tell you that creating fantasy scenery and environments with minimal materials is a high art. Please, I encourage you types, take, say, $50,000 and see where it gets you. No cheating, no CGI. Sounds like a lot of money? Well, today even $500,000 isn't a lot of money!

This is why this film, THX1138, and Mario Bava's Planet of the Vampires (among other so-called ""cheap"" 50s and 60s films)are held in high esteem by people like Martin Scorcese. Other flicks such as the original Solaris take hits too from various uninformed critics but Tarkovsy spent all his money on the space station; that's where the action takes place. It was, no doubt, a difficult decision but ultimately the best one for the film. The space station is fantastic.

As far as wooden dialogue goes please hold judgement until a non-dubbed version is available. You want a shock? Watch the dubbed Mysterians (A great Japanese film) and then watch the subtitled version. It's the difference between Hello Kitty and Seven Samurai. Americans seemed (and still seem) to have nothing but disdain for foreign product--the English dubbing was often jokey and disrespectful as it was just recently for Godzilla 2000.

Want another shock? Dig up, say, the remastered, wide-screen Gozilla vs Monster Zero and get humble. The art direction in this film is as good as, if not at times better, than anything Hollywood was doing at the time (I'd argue better--the Japanese clearly tried harder). Also get over the guy-in-rubber-suit-as-monster complaint. Find a decent alternative. Sorry, stop-frame doesn't work--you need to animate all the destruction too. Harryhausen used very limited destruction in his flicks because of that problem; same with George Pal. Ever make an animated film (and not on a computer)? It's a real joy, let me tell you.

As far as this film goes, nobody should say boo until they see the full 130 minute subtitled version in restored color, in other words, the film the darned East Germans made in the first place. How can anyone dare to complain about a chopped insensitively dubbed movie? It's like criticizing King Lear based on the Classic Comics version or the Barber of Seville based on the Bugs Bunny version! I'm really understanding these days why all great artists and writers had serious problems wth critics. Or go buy the Russian Ilya Murometz movie listed on Amazon and see what incredible things these Commies could do in the fantasy realm. That film will surprise you.

As far as older movies go, I encourage people to suspend disbelief for a few hours, don't TRY to pick the film apart or get smug because you think The Matrix was cooler, and bask in the phenomenal imagination and creativity that's apparent in many of these productions. This particular movie has stunning ideas executed with considerable imagination and professionalism. Eventually you'll notice a disturbing thing: there are often many more novel ideas and great touches in these films than in contemporary ones.

Seems like the last batch of outer space movies I saw, including the plain awful recent Star Wars release (please complain to me about wooden acting in 50s movies after that!)were stuffed with dull and lackluster props, robots, and spacecraft. Interestingly the most imaginative stuff in the last Star Wars movies was retro--influenced by 50s design! Find me anywhere better Robots than Robbie, from Forbidden Planet, and the one from Visit to a Prehistoric Planet. Find me a spookier robot than the one from Devil Girl from Mars. Writing as a professional designer who's built a few robots, including an animated six-foot Star Wars item, Robbie is an unqualified masterpiece. I am still STUNNED by him, as you should be too.

Please, regarding these old movies, BE VERY HUMBLE. Many of them have wonderous qualities we've lost track of. For example I'd cite the underwater shots of the Nautilus from the Disney's 20,000 Leagues, the magical moon interiors from First Men in the Moon, and the stunning and enchanting trip to the moon sequence in the 1940s Baron Munchausen, let alone the nighttime Zeppelin shots in the 1930s Hell's Angels. It's the sort of breathtaking work--sublime beauty of the highest order--you just don't see in this hit-you-in-the-head-with-a-sledgehammer day and age. Gad, find me sublime ANYTHING these days. The word is off our radar screen.",1118707200,9,4544,5.002645502645502
952237,3,6304953585,"One of the basic necessities for any film is that it must contain enough of the seeds of human drama and conflict so that the audience will pay attention.  In FIRST SPACESHIP ON VENUS, director Kurt Maetzig provides a visual treat for the eyes but a vacuum where there should have been a sense of community amidst a sense of cinematic awe.  Based on a novel by Polish writer Stanislaw Lem, FSV tells of the 1908 Tunguska explosion in Siberia that resulted in the discovery of a spool of data that contained hints of an oncoming attack on Earth from Venus.  Eight scientists of various nationalties pilot a craft to Venus in the hopes of averting the holocaust.  The problem from a dramatic viewpoint is that screen time is split roughly in an equal manner among the eight thus insuring that the audience gains no sense of differentiation among the crew.  The closest that the viewer gets to a personal level is a hint that two of them (One of whom is Yoko Tani, a respected Japanese actress who starred in many German and French sci-fi films) once had an affair.  Once the audience sees that any connection to the film must be on a visual level, FSV does not fail to deliver.  The special effects for the year (1959) are impressive.  There is a scene of a flow of intelligent black goo that envelops the astronauts that is chilling in its intensity.  When these astronauts discover that the Venusians self-destructed in the decades prior to the arrival of the Earth craft, it becomes clear that director Maetzig wanted to see FSV as a parable of the immolation inherent in a blind rage to destroy others with nuclear weapons. However, by the film's end, the lack of human connection so dilutes this warning that the film is forced to stand of the wobbly legs of special effects, and whenever any film does this, the results are predictably weakened.  FSV then is reduced to a case of what might have been in the hands of better scripting.",1110672000,,1938,4.57514450867052
952238,3,6304953585,"First Spaceship on Venus provides us with this critical piece of advice - if you go to another planet and find yourself closely pursued by black goo, don't shoot it - not unless you want something really bad to happen to Earth, at least.  You have to admire the optimism of these filmmakers, though, as they -from their 1962 perspective - imagined that in 1985 the world would be a pretty happy place where people wore great big letters of the alphabet on their shirts for some insane reason, where a moon base would already have been established, and where scientists from all countries worked together to send a spaceship to Venus.  Why Venus?  A strange metallic object has been discovered; scientists have concluded it came from the famous Tunguska Event of 1908 and is nothing less than a spool containing a message from another planet - a planet which, given the trajectory of the object that exploded over Siberia all those years ago, had to be Venus.  Lickety-split, it's up, up, and away to Venus, as Earth seeks its first contact with an alien race.

Things start to go a little downhill when the grouchy scientist from India interprets the mystery spool and learns it details a plan of attack on Earth by the Venusians.  Of course, there's also the obligatory meteorite-dodging scene that has to play out.  Undaunted, though, our international crew of a half dozen men and one woman (someone had to serve the nutritious liquid beverages, I guess) sporting exceedingly ridiculous spacesuits (leisure suits for space, I would call them, complemented by banana suits for takeoffs and landings) continue their mission to Venus.  The landing mission doesn't go so well, either.

There's really no chemistry between the crewmembers, not even between the man and woman who supposedly had some kind of relationship in the past.  The crew commander is interesting, though, because his hair seems to grow taller as the movie progresses and he also seems to experience some sort of German silent expressionist film flashbacks from time to time.  Frankly, I didn't really care who made it back and who didn't, and Venus itself turned out to be less interesting than the interior of the boring ship (where chess games were the highlight of space life).

First Spaceship on Venus does at least attempt to be a serious science fiction movie, but at its heart it is yet another anti-nuclear film of the early 1960s.  Frankly, I would not have tried to make a point at the end of the film because, all told, the whole thing was rather pointless to begin with.",1098576000,4,2553,4.801369863013699
952239,4,6304953585,"You all know the story: scientists working on this project to irrigate the Gobi desert in 1985 discover a mysterious rock later linked to the famed Tunguska explosion of 1908.  The rock itself contains an artifact - a magnetic spool of non-human manufacture, a flight recorder from what is determined to have been a doomed spaceship.  Brilliant scientists from around the world decode the damaged spool's message, eventually deducing its origin as Earth's sister planet - Venus.  At first, all antennas are directed towards Venus in the hopes of making contact.  When Venus remains silent, but before the scientists have completely decoded the spool, they join the crew of a fantastic new spaceship - the ""Kosmoskrator"" - and rocket towards the planet.  Mid-flight, Kosmoskrator's international crew learn that the spool's message was hostile - documenting a plan to irradiate the Earth in preparation for invasion.  With their communications apparently jammed by Venus, the crew decides to land on the planet.  There they find a nightmare world, permanently enshrouded in darkness (and superimposed floating clouds), wracked by storms and otherwise hostile to anybody alive.  They find huge venusian cities and enigmatic and sinister machines, but ominously no venusians.  The crew looks farther across the landscape where they learn of the horrible fate of the Venusians and the plans they had for earth.

This was a frustrating film - undone by the twin evils of poor editing and the test of time.  Slightly less than an hour and a half, it's not a long movie - conspicuously so given the plot holes that bedevil the flick until the end (one of the crewmen, having used the help of a fellow scientist to descend into a Venusian control center, manages to climb out himself; What he did down there isn't even shown; we're told that the gravity of the planet is shifting wildly due to the Venusians' matter-energy conversion machines, but the Astronauts outside seem unaffected; Yoko Tani as the ship's beautiful doctor follows the astronaut's outside, even though her skills are useless while everybody wears spacesuits.).  The scientists make the deductions needed to keep the plot moving - but not very plausibly.  Not originally an English-language film, the dubbing seems at least as bad as a Godzilla flick - to this day, I'm not sure if it's Kosmoskrator or Kosmos-trator or who knows.  There's a small tank-like robot named Omega, but it's pronounced more like ""Ohmigawd"".  Lastly, the idea of a utopian future of international cooperation is not only dated, but obviates the cautionary message of the story - certainly the denizens of 1985 need no warning about the dangers of nuclear warfare when they've conquered all obstacles to world peace.  Nothing in the script alludes to its pedigree of the film - a story by Lem of Solaris fame, since disowned.

On the plus side, it's important to remember that, like the myserious ""spool"", FSOV is itself a lost relic and incomplete.  Patently horrible editing makes it obvious that we're not getting the whole story and, what's left is intriguing enough for some viewers to fill in the gaps without resorting to the ""Tom Servo"" treatment.  The beautiful Kosmoskrator ranks among the more memorable of classic rocketships and, for its time, convincingly depicted (excellent use of forced perspective).  The ship rivals Venus itself for attention (see why their shared the bill?)  Venus is an unforgettable ghost world - bad weather (even the clouds look like ghosts) and weird structures achieve the same sort of eeriness that marked the more-respected ""Quatermass and the Pit"".  If ""Forbidden Planet"" was modeled on the futurist scapes of Bonestell, then Venus here takes its cues from a nightmare mix of Picasso and Dali.  That the science underlying the plot is junk science only adds to the sense that the human leads are in over their heads on Venus.  Particularly memorable are cone-shaped buildings suggesting ant-hills, and the shadows of Venusians etched into walls by the cataclysm (a nifty riff on Hiroshima, and one of many clues of the flick's origins in Eastern Europe).

But FSoV excels because, like the ""spool"", it too is a relic of something alien.  A product from the other side of the iron curtain (Brinkman, the American astronaut, arrives at the Kosmoskrator's launch site in a MiG-15 with East German markings), there isn't a recognizable face or location to be had.  Instead of Dana Andrews in a trim silver jumpsuit, FSOV gives us unfamiliar types in tele-Tubby costumes.  This gives FSoV a sort of earnestness bereft of Hollywood shmaltz (and light on the commie shmaltz as well).  None of these guys even looks or sounds like a Hollywood type (Harringway and Brinkman are supposed to be American, but don't look it; Yoko Tani as Sumiko is hot, but the casting gives her only Brinkman, and he's a brick) which, when combined with its documentary-like early scenes, gives FSoV a flavor of serious sci-fi.  Between that and the film's unique look, and it's impossible to avoid repeat viewings - if only to spot clues to the real film the producers wanted to make, but could never bring back to us.",1096156800,,5176,5.005834305717619

It's the perfect lay in bed and doze-off-to movie. My recommendation: skip the Diamond fullscreen DVD version (which doesn't have any better quality than VHS tape) and go for the Image version. The only advantage the Diamond DVD has is that it's a double feature with ""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"", an almost decent dozer. I won't go into the plot or details since other reviews have.

952305,4,6304953585,"Polish science fiction novelist Stanislaw Lem (born 1922) must take pride in the fact that his ""Solaris"" (1962) has now been twice filmed, first by Andrei Tarkovsky (1972) and more recently - also less effectively - by an American director whose name escapes me (2003); yet as early as 1960 Lem's first science fiction novel, ""The Astronauts"" (1952), had already appeared in an adaptation for the silver screen, directed by an East German, Kurt Maetzig.  ""First Spaceship on Venus"" issued, in fact, from a Polish and East German collaboration, with contributions, in the ensemble of players, from three or four ""third world"" nations.  Viewers will recognize Japanese actress Yoko Tani as the sole female crewmember of the space research vessel ""Cosmostrator,"" the titular ""First Spaceship"" on earth's putative ""twin,"" Venus.  This is a mostly superb film, quite magical in its expressionistic special effects.  Enticingly for audiences, almost half of the action takes place on Venus amidst sets that do justice to Lem's insistence that alien life will be incomprehensible to humanity.  The story, briefly, is this: in 1985 excavations ""to irrigate the Gobi Desert"" discover extraterrestrial artifacts, one of which, a glassy ""spool,"" contains the last message sent home from a spaceship engaged in reconnoitering the earth.  The narration links this fictional incident to the actual 1908 Tunguska meteor impact.  The ""spool"" has sustained damage and yields only a fraction of its contents, but from this bit scientists determine that the visitors originated on Venus, whereupon the ""World Space Agency"" determines to mount an expedition there.  An international crew take command of the ""Cosmostrator.""  The ""Cosmostrator"" itself demands some attention as one of the most unusual of silver-screen spaceships of the 1950s and 60s: its central silvery cylinder, housing the crew, is surrounded by four similarly hued cylinders of nearly equal dimension housing the engines; the sum of it is a kind of powerful elegance.  But the real interest lies in the Venusian scenario itself.  Maetzig gives us a shadowy, smoke-and-gas- shrouded landscape full of weird, half-obliterated shapes.  One sequence shows the astronauts moving in their ""ground cars"" through what appears to be a street of melted skyscrapers; there are also huge underground spaces and indecipherable geodesic spheres and cones.  The explorers gradually deduce that, on the verge of dousing the earth with radiation preparatory to invading and occupying it, the Venusians destroyed themselves in a fratricidal atomic war.  We see the permanently etched shadows of the victims on a blasted wall.  In an extremely alien episode, a lake of organic muck chases the terrestrials up the spiral ramp of a half-fused tower, only to retreat mysteriously before catching them fatally at the summit.  The visuals elude adequate verbal description.  If anyone knew the work of the 1950s and 60s science fiction illustrator Richard Powers, who did paperback covers in a semi-abstract style full of glassy-metallic quasi-biological and quasi-mechanical shapes, that might serve as a good reference.  (Samples of Powers' work can be found on-line, should anyone care to go looking.)  At the film's finale, in the prototypical Lem-gambit, the Venusians' automated defenses reverse the planet's gravity-field, hurling the ""Cosmostrator"" back into space, minus two or three unlucky casualties.  Despite the Soviet-era utopian bravura, the mission has accomplished but little - the explorers are, in effect, defeated.  Between the human and the non-human no genuine communication seems possible, especially where one party has insulated itself behind layers of electronics and automation and is long since a collective suicide.  (This story of non-communication comes quite close to the plot of ""Solaris,"" superficial differences notwithstanding - Tarkovsky must surely have known Maetzig's film; he would of course have been familiar with Lem's work beyond ""Solaris."")  One senses that this English version, with a dubbed soundtrack for American distribution, probably leaves a good many scenes on the cutting-room floor; neither can one tell much about the acting, which, in any case, is of less interest than the strangely realized other world.  There is an amusing tracked robot named Omega.  The source-print seems well preserved and the format is wide-screen.  (A video-tape from a different producer derived from a faded print and cut the image down to television-screen dimensions.)  On the strength of the scenic design, this movie should recommend itself to genre aficionados.  Anyone who has never seen it is in for a treat.",1049846400,38,4680,5.4535367545076285

I love the genuine PC (not our fake one!) detail: the spaceship crew include an African and a Chinese scientist something unimaginable in Hollywood not only back in its 50's sci-fi schlok era.

952308,4,6304953585,"As evidenced by the extremely mixed reviews here, this East German/Polish co-production (filmed in 1959, released here in 1962) seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it affair. Personally, I'm in the lovers' camp, although if you've never seen First Spaceship on Venus you deserve some fair warning. According to IMDb, the East German version of this runs 130 minutes, the Polish (?) version 93. If either figure is reliable there's anywhere from 15 to 52 minutes missing from the 78-minute U.S. version, so there are definitely continuity problems. The English script is somewhat muddled and seems to repeat or contradict itself at times, several subplots have obviously been trimmed or junked entirely, and the English dubbing is particularly bad, with virtually no attempt to match dialogue with people's mouth movements. Also somewhat distracting is the heavy use of stock music cues (particularly the familiar Universal ""Wolf Man"" theme), although a few almost dissonant passages sound like they might be snippets of the original score. Between the heavy editing, rewriting, and dubbing it's really impossible to evaluate the original screenplay, but even with only the skeleton of SF legend Stanislaw Lem's original novel that's left, it's still more conceptually challenging than the average 1950s space opera (compare the roughly contemporary War of the Satellites, Missile to the Moon, or even a ""classic"" such as This Island Earth). In brief, a Venus mission is launched to determine the source of an ominous message encoded into a metallic spool unearthed by archaeologists. As noted by others, there are a number of ideas that presage later, more famous SF productions, including Star Trek (the racially and sexually diverse flight crew and Moon base personnel), 2001: A Space Odyssey (the robot chess game; the EVA repair mission; the buried artifact that's actually a communications device), and Star Wars (the `cute' R2D2-like robot), as well as a few bits more typical of cheap 50s sci-fi (the meteor shower, the shipboard romance). If you can bear with the roughness of the script and dialogue you will be rewarded with some very creative and generally superior (for the time) production design, optical and sound effects, and miniature/model work. The Earth laboratories, Moon base, and spaceship all look cool enough, and that artifact makes some crazy sounds, but when they get to Venus, things really kick into gear. There are strange sponge-like trees, lots of swirling smoke and fog, and wispy neon-colored gelatinous clouds flying around. The astronauts discover some high-tech Venusian ""ruins,"" are attacked by black-and-red lava-like blob creatures, and ultimately discover the extinct Venusians' forbidding secret. The absence of big Hollywood bucks does show at times (the metal ""bugs"" are laughably cheesy, even for 1959), but First Spaceship on Venus makes up in imagination what it lacks in budget, much like Mario Bava's Planet of the Vampires. If you dig the general atmosphere of that movie, this is probably up your alley as well. If you can't get past the problems with the script and dubbing, or are expecting slick modern special effects, this is probably not your cup of tea. If only someone could release the German version, competently dubbed or subtitled, FSOV would probably be ranked right up there with the Golden Age ""classics""-Forbidden Planet, Destination Moon, Rocketship X-M, etc. As it is, ""serious"" SF fans will probably be intrigued, if not completely satisfied, while the casual viewer may find it rough sledding.
Fortunately for fans of FSOV, Wade Williams and Image have unearthed a virtually pristine print for this DVD transfer. It's letterboxed at 2.35:1 and the color saturation, color balance, black level, sharpness, and shadow/highlight detail are generally excellent. (There is a little blocking-up in the shadows at times.) Physical damage is limited to some very light speckling/blemishing, that does get a bit heavier around a couple of reel changes, and the occasional damaged frame. After years of watching cropped, faded, dupey TV prints it's a revelation to actually see the whole frame, and especially in such terrific shape. Until someone lays their hands on the original European cut this is probably as good as this film will ever look. (Be sure to avoid the awful full-frame Diamond DVD edition that's paired with Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet; and I haven't seen the Platinum DVD but it's a safe bet it's just as bad if not worse than Diamond's.) The trailer for FSOV is matted to about 1.85:1 and doesn't look nearly as nice as the feature, suffering from mediocre color, scratching, and a soft, dupey look. Five trailers for other Wade Williams/Image releases are also included. A can't-miss buy for admirers of this underappreciated Eastern European gem.",1028160000,21,4829,5.248382923673997

Enroute, the linguists continue to translate the artifact, discovering a clearly hostile intent brewing among its creators.  Nevertheless, they press on.  Landing on Venus, the crew discovers, not hostile Venusians, but the remains of a murdered world - empty cities, a hostile atmosphere, mysterious blob-like creatures, and a mysterious force that radically alters the gravity of Venus to opposite extremes while turning the humans' machines against them.  The Venusians are long gone, their only remains being the shadows etched onto the walls of their cities by a possibly nuclear war.  before the end of the film, some crew members are flung into space, others are marooned on Venus, and the survivors just barely manage to return to Earth before disarming a massive machine that flings deadly radiation at other planets - its final target being the Earth.
When you think of '60's sci-fi, you tend to think of B movies, maybe even Z movies.  Unlike these, the handsome production values, moody music, surreal sets and the scripts pedigree (Tarkovsky, of ""Solaris"" fame) of FSOV set the film apart, showing the intention to make a groundbreaking film that would take sci-fi to a level way above ""Plan-9"".  Unfortunately, the production doesn't so much redeem what this film is as much as remind what could have been, but was ruined by some gaping holes in the plot, poor post-production work and horrible dubbing.  (To this day, I'm not sure whether the ship is named Kosmos-Krator, - trator or -strata; the robot is definately named ""Omega"", but the dubbing sounds more like ""Omigawd"").  It's impossible to say whether lapses in continuity came from the script or merely resulted afterwards when the film was cut and nobody realized how important some scenes were (like showing how the human scientists disarm the world-killing radioactive device).  Much of the film looks derivative, until you realize how new some of the plot elements were in 1962: the excavated artifact (""2001""; ""Quatermass and the Pit"") and the multicultural crew of a harmonious future earth (""Trek"") are just two ideas that seem dated today but were new when this flick debuted.  The ineptitude of the post-production and the fact that the film was marketed thruought Europe, has spurred tales of a ""director's cut"" lasting about two hours long, one in which the glaring errors don't exist, but I've yet to run across anybody who's ever seen a cut that long.  This one, though only 78 minutes is atleast letterboxed, so you'll have a lot to look at before you realize how little you've experienced.",998352000,,3147,5.095330739299611
952311,5,6304953585,"Sure this film has its problems...its just that its highlights lift it far enuff above them that this film is still enjoyable. Made in 1958, and  released in 1959 (1962 in USA) this movie is remarkable for its forward  thinking cast & crew, production design, and effects, which are only a  notch below todays multi-billion dollar (and sometimes STILL fake-looking)  CGI effects....as for the slow pace and ""philosophising""-this is  a European film, and they tend to avoid car crashes, car chases,  explosions, laserblasts, and babes in g-strings if they are not important  to the story...commenting on the human condition is a norm in these films,  but this may put those with ADD to sleep...",966643200,4,693,5.017543859649122
952312,4,6304953585,"I bought this film based on vague childhood memories of neat movie about a dark and mysterious planet being visited by an international crew from Earth. I was not disappointed. Although its translation into English adds a  hokey air and a few chuckles due to some rather clumsy dialog, special  effects (not high tech) and a generally good story line make this an  interesting and highly entertaining film.

7881075,3,6304953585,"It is the 1962 view of 1985 (they could have picked 1984). All is right with the world. We discover a rock that contains a spool (what ever a spool is); the spool is discovered to contain a message. And want a message. In 1908 Tunguska (read the facts about this in the book ""The Fire Came by: The Riddle of the Great Siberian Explosion"" by John Baxter - 1976) a great explosion took place. Evidently this was a space vehicle of extraterrestrial origin. It jettisoned the spool upon exploding.

We do not have time to decipher the message now so it will have to be deciphered on the way to Venus. Our East German space ship rivals those of Japanese sci-fi with one exception. This ship has an emergency Gyro that can only be activated by using a special hammer to break the glass.

Mean time what will we find on Venus and will it destroy or carry a message to all mankind.",1497398400,,873,4.317073170731708
