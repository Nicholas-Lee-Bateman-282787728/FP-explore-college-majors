""THE FUGITIVE ....
A QUINN MARTIN PRODUCTION ....
STARRING: DAVID JANSSEN, AS DOCTOR RICHARD KIMBLE ....
AN INNOCENT VICTIM OF BLIND JUSTICE ....
THIS VIDEO'S EPISODES: ""BRASS RING"" AND ""IN A PLAIN PAPER WRAPPER""!""

--------------------------------

Didn't I sound just like Bill Conrad there?!  :)

My imitation voice narration notwithstanding, this VHS videotape does indeed contain two complete, uncut episodes of the stellar and always-entertaining TV drama series, ""The Fugitive"" (the original series which was on the air in the 1960s).

David Janssen's portrayal of ""Dr. Richard Kimble"" is legendary for its superb quality of understated tension and feeling. Janssen, as Kimble, could practically go through an entire one-hour ""Fugitive"" episode without saying much of anything and still manage to give a tremendous acting performance on screen. Many times, the ""Fugitive"" directors would rely on just a facial expression, or a quick glance of concern, or that trademark David Janssen combination ""twitch/faint smile"" to convey the message that needed to come across to the viewing audience. David could twitch with the best of 'em, I'll tell ya that right now!

This video was issued by ""Republic Pictures""/""Republic Entertainment, Inc."" in 1998, and is labeled ""Tape Seven"" in a series of ""Fugitive"" volumes released by ""Republic"" on home video.

This tape's first offering, ""Brass Ring"", stars a 33-year-old Angie Dickinson as the scheming sister of Robert Duvall. Duvall plays a disabled man, unable to walk, who is helped immeasurably by Dr. Kimble's recuperative administrations. Angie is not at all pleased by her brother's medical progress. You see, she has other plans for dear brother.

This is a solid ""Fuge"" outing, although not one of my all-time favorites. But, like all installments in this 120-episode series, it's a well-written script and a nicely-performed show.

""Brass Ring"" (a B&W ep.) first aired during the series' second season, on January 5, 1965. It was the 46th show in the history of the series. John Ericson, Phillip Pine, and Karl Swenson co-star with Dickinson and Duvall.

Next up is ""In A Plain Paper Wrapper"" (Episode #89), which was originally shown on network television at the very end of the third season of ""The Fugitive"", on April 19, 1966. ""Wrapper"", also a black-and-white episode, stars Kurt Russell (who was just shy of age 15 here). Kurt plays a teenager who purchases a rifle by mail-order and makes an attempt at capturing Dr. Kimble. In this episode, Russell's character is slightly on the cocky side, and is the leader of a neighborhood gang of kids. Together, they pool their resources and send away for the rifle that they think will make them famous, by apprehending the ""Interstate Fugitive"" -- Richard Kimble.

Although the younger generation is portrayed as rather ""rough"" here, I still get the feeling that this ""gang"" which Russell heads is not altogether *that* tough after all. An underlying goodness is evident in these kids, even though they're toting around rifles by episode's end. It strikes me that the show's producers didn't want to give the impression that these kids were truly ""bad"", despite the subject matter dealing with firearms.

Lois Nettleton and Michael Strong are among the other guest stars in the ""Wrapper"" episode. Pat Cardi also co-stars, as a younger boy who wants to join Kurt's group/gang. This kid (Cardi) must have had to run about 2 miles while filming this episode. He's constantly running (full speed) up and down the city's streets. It's not just for exercise, however -- the script *does* call for such fleet-footed activity by the youngster.

An interesting side note concerning the ""Paper Wrapper"" ep. -- Kurt Russell's father, Bing Russell, also makes a brief guest appearance in the episode. Bing shows up as a police officer.

Kurt Russell also appeared in one other ""Fugitive"" episode -- entitled ""Nemesis"", from Season 2. In that one, Kurt plays the son of Kimble-chasing Police Detective Philip Gerard. Kurt's dad, Bing, also appears in that same episode.

This VHS cassette runs for approximately 98 minutes (about 49 minutes per ""Fuge"" episode), and sports Hi-Fi Stereo sound (re-mixed from the original Mono tracks). Video is presented in the TV ratio of 1.33:1.

The original TV series, ""The Fugitive"" (1963-1967), remains one of my favorite shows to this day. The ongoing struggle that confronts a man wanted by the law for a murder he did not commit, as brilliantly portrayed by David Janssen, made for some of the best dramatic television in the history of that medium. And on this 2-episode videotape, you'll get a taste of that superior style and substance, which for four years made ""The Fugitive"" a weekly habit in many American living rooms.",1102032000,2,4828,5.153452685421995
7878591,4,6304865481,"One of the many themes running through four seasons of THE FUGITIVE is that of Kimble as the healer.  In his pre-fugitive days, Kimble was a pediatrician.  After his escape from the death train, in many episodes, he is seen as a healer of some sort, sometimes a healer of the body, others of the mind.  In BRASS RING, Kimble as Ben Horton, lands a job as a personal attendant for a man crippled in both mind and soul.  Robert Duvall plays Leslie Stevens, who years before suffered a car accident that left him paralyzed from the neck down. His paralysis affects him personally.  He becomes withdrawn and abusive to his sister, Norma, played with a great deal of repressed sexuality by Angie Dickinson.  Norma grows to hate her brother and his tantrums.  It is only the fact that Leslie was given many thousands of dollars as an insurance settlement that keeps her by his side.  Since she shies away from caring for a man with such total disability, she hires Kimble, but not only to care for him.  Slowly, she compares Kimble's goodness to her boyfriend, Lars, who plans to kill him for the money, and the more she sees how Kimble interacts with Leslie, the better he looks.  Kimble works with Leslie daily, overlooking the sarcasms dumped on him, knowing that he can help.  And help he does. Little by little Kimble teaches Leslie how to regain mobility.  Leslie, of course, is overjoyed and asks Kimble to leave town with him and spend the insurance money on riotous living.  This idea does not sit well with Lars, who kills Leslie and blames the murder on Kimble. Surprisingly, Norma admits the truth to the police, knowing that she will go to jail for her role in the murder of her brother.
  This episode, while not one of the series' finest, is still one of the better ones in that Kimble gets yet another opportunity to show how his inner goodness can act as a tonic to bring out the best in those who only suspect that they are good too.",1026086400,2,1945,4.501424501424501
7878592,5,6304865481,"This episode, like almost all the others in the first 3 seasons episodes, was outstanding. The writing and acting are superb. David Jansen was the perfect actor in the perfect role in the golden age of television. I hope the entire series comes out on DVD some day. It is a series to be cherished.",1008201600,,297,4.418181818181818
