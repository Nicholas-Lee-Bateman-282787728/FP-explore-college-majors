6578121,5,B00MHIKQB6,"I really enjoyed myself watching this pilot. I was slightly skeptical since we were trading the great Star Wars: The Clone Wars for this. However, unlike Clone Wars, I didn't feel like I had to click on my Star Wars switch to watch this. Since I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan, I'm always eager to see their new content but I loved Spark of Rebellion purely from a cinematic standpoint. The music is rich and powerful and is smart enough to remain absent during certain parts of the movie. The characters are all really fun and interesting. Spark of Rebellion gives you just enough of each crew member to get you to like them but leave you anxious for more (when the series arrives). There are a couple moments that are enriched by knowledge of the movies and Clone Wars but it really does stand on its own. I also appreciate that it doesn't rely on any pre-established feelings fans might have about certain things (i.e. Jedi, star destroyers, etc) and chooses instead to make its own impression, independently of everything else. For this reason, I would say that whether you're an avid fan like me, looking to rekindle your love for Star Wars, or an entirely new fan, this is a great place to join. Excellent film and excellent Star Wars!",1411776000,21,1237,4.576576576576577
6578122,1,B00MHIKQB6,"I cannot believe that they canceled The Clone Wars series for this. As usual Disney ruins something great. They crapped all over Marvel,but now they have gone too far. What was Lucas thinking? There will not be hardly any duels because most of the Jedi are gone because of the purge. But of course I'll be watching because I'm a Star Wars buff and I'll really have no other choice,unless I want to watch reruns. I really wouldn't mind the high price if Disney hadn't gotten hold of it.",1410048000,7,485,4.46067415730337

6578124,2,B00MHIKQB6,"$17.99 for a 43 minute long DVD?  In 2014?  Disney can't be serious.  Looks like they are carrying on George Lucas's strategy of gouging fans with low-quality merchandise for high prices, just by slapping the name ""Star Wars"" on the front.

I'd consider this a fair price if it was  1)  $9.99  and 2) Blu-Ray (HD-format, which 99.9% of the people will watch this in, on their HDTVs, when it premieres on cable on the Disney channel)

I hope that the show is worthwhile, but this item is a complete ripoff.....it earned 1 extra star just because they are trying to incorporate Ralph McQuarrie's artwork into the show's design.  It would have been great if they had carried his design style over to the characters instead of just the scenery (the characters look 100% ""Disney-fied"", with the main protagonist like an Aladdin ripoff), but it is at least a small aspect of quality thrown our way.",1408665600,18,892,4.666666666666667

6578138,1,B00MHIKQB6,"Well I'm finally all caught up with Star Wars rebels. I really really really wanted to like this show but, it's crap. the only thing good is when they bring back clone wars characters, but they cheese them out so they're not as epic as they used to be both in animation and in character. Ashoka is really the only one that stayed pretty true to her original character think God but they barely use her. And the last episode of the season at least the end of it was amazing just wish the rest of the series could match that. I just don't get it, from what I understand it's the same people who made clone wars so why so sucky? I guess the only obvious reason would be ""Disney""and a ""Disney network cartoon"" so it's basically just a cartoon not a good show. Makes me sad. And this splitting up  The season and have his classic Disney money grubbing",1464307200,,846,4.254658385093168

The timeline they chose for Rebels and Force Awakens is convoluted and not at all thought-out. All the new events seem forced and thrown together. It's like they tried to recycle Star Wars but used all the wrong pieces. What will be really bad is when they attempt to tie this ill-conceived, boring, foolish series in with the atrocious new live action Star Wars movies.",1452470400,,456,4.858974358974359

Kanan, Hera, Sabina, Zeb, Chopper and their newest member, Ezra Bridger, plus Agent Kallus and the Inquisitor.  Everything looked great except the Wookies did not look drawn that well, but the story was real good.

6578167,5,B00MHIKQB6,"This was not bad at all. A little too childish but this was really good. This film is a great introduction to the characters for the television series. I loved it because it's not really a downer because The Clone Wars was very dark and we all know what happens to everyone. But in this show you don't know what to expect. This is a great film and tv series. I had my doubts but this is a great series!

6578194,4,B00MHIKQB6,"So there was definitely some great Star Wars action, but for the most part this was a setup pilot. There were some things they did great, like the speeder bike scenes, or the wookie rescue, and then there was stuff that seemed too contrived trying to grasp at the greatness of the OT like the fact that in 5 years since we left Kanan, where he was afraid and cautious of showing his powers, that now he is willing to take on a padawan, and in some sense considers himself a suedo-jedi. Similar to the Clone Wars animated series this was a decent start but has a lot of ground it needs to improve on. Oh, they did throw in an Obi-Wan appearance and of course it was voiced by James Arnold Taylor, who has been the voice of Kenobi for the past 6 years on the Clone Wars series, so this was a very cool nod to that as well.

Also I would suggest watching the ABC released version on their official website if you want to see the Special Guest appearance (totally awesome) that is well worth the nostalgia alone, and adds heavily to the tiny introduction of the new villain of the series, the Inquisitor (voice by Jason Isaacs, known most recently as Malfoy Senior in the Harry Potter movies). This is Disney showing how dedicated they are to making this work, and I am not seeing a problem in this respect.",1417737600,,1303,4.318367346938776

The Clone Wars series was well done, but the main characters were all adults.

6578215,5,B00MHIKQB6,"Having watched the original STAR WARS from A NEW HOPE in 1977 onward, I have been looking for a similar series with all the creativity, humor and action that marked this franchise way back when. I was disappointed in the prequels and I don't even own them. But I bought this DVD on the strength of other reviewers' comments. This short pilot is a great start toward what I hope will be a really enjoyable series. Some reviewers have commented that Ezra is a lot like Aladdin. Since one of the other characters calls him 'a street rat', I would say that was not a coincidence. But I think Ezra is a wonderful character to drive the action, with a lot of Aladdin and a lot of Han Solo in his personality. You are pulling for him from the beginning. The rest of the team have great talents that add spice to the proceedings and there are so many opportunities for plot lines, it has plenty of possibilities. I would also say that you don't really need a blu-ray edition. On my old Sony blu player with a 46"" screen, it looked crystal clear.",1413504000,,1037,4.350515463917525
6578216,3,B00MHIKQB6,"Sunday, October 26, 2014,""Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion"" is heading to ABC featuring bonus content and a special guest appearance!  (This series normally airs on Disney XD on Monday evenings.

The critically-acclaimed epic adventure Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion will air on ABC on Sunday, October 26 (7:00 p.m. ET/PT). Executive producer Dave Filoni states, We wanted to do something special for the ABC broadcast. Weve added a scene which gives audiences insight into the Inquisitor and includes a cameo by Darth Vader voiced by the distinguished actor James Earl Jones.

Is this added scene included on the DVD being released on 10/14/2014?  No one can confirm, but it does not sound like it.

Where is the Blu-ray?  (Stat Wars fans are disproportionately nerdy and likely want this show on Blu-ray.)

I had this pre-ordered and cancelled once I heard a new shot was being added to the first episode (being released on DVD as a stand-alone. 43 minute featurette) because I am not going to buy it only to have it get re-released later with this Vader scene added.

More on the show: Set between the events of Star Wars Episodes III and IV, the Star Wars Rebels story unfolds during a dark time when the evil Galactic Empire is tightening its grip of power on the galaxy. Imperial forces have occupied a remote planet and are ruining the lives of its people. The motley but clever crew of the starship Ghost  cowboy Jedi Kanan, ace pilot Hera, street-smart teenager Ezra, the muscle Zeb, warrior firebrand Sabine, and grumpy old astromech droid Chopper  will face threatening new villains, embark on thrilling adventures and become heroes with the power to ignite a rebellion.",1412899200,16,1691,4.901754385964912
6578217,2,B00MHIKQB6,"I don't typically review anything but this item caught my attention. Star Wars has always beem a big part of my life. My parents introduced me to it when I was very young and was in love with it ever since. My two star rating is not for the show itself, its for the DVD. First of all it is overpriced for just 40 minutes. The show I will give 5 stars. Great characters and overall great start to the new show. I feel like Disney should have waited until the first season was over to release this and have it be a part of the season 1 Blu-ray. I will not pay this price for 40 minutes of content. Kind of sad that Disney is doing this to Star Wars. But what can you expect? Its Disney.",1412812800,4,684,3.963768115942029
6578218,4,B00MHIKQB6,"I'll be the first to say, the show isn't perfect, but when it comes right down to it, it's fun.  The ""movie"" does a reasonably good job of introducing the characters and getting a feel for the current settings for the Star Wars universe.

The characters are very likable, and lend themselves very well to future expansion, the story has a lot of places it can go, and I'm looking forward to following it.  As some have pointed out, it may not hold up to Clone Wars, but Clone Wars had 6 seasons to establish itself.  It's pilot was pretty terrible.  I think Rebels is coming from a stronger starting position, with a whole new set of characters for whom we don't already know the pre-ordained outcome.  This has the potential to grow into a pretty awesome show.

I will note that the price for what's basically 2 TV episodes seems a little high.  I'll probably wait on buying the DVD.  I'm guessing the costit will come down with time or end up in assorted discount bins.",1412553600,3,971,4.440677966101695
6578219,4,B00MHIKQB6,I enjoyed the show very much. However you're better off buying the iTunes season pass for $6 where you'll get the whole season!,1412467200,2,127,4.565217391304348
6578220,4,B00MHIKQB6,"Overall, I enjoyed this preview, but found the young protagonist Ezra to be a recycling of Disney's Alladin; looks & sounds & acts just like him, & the oft repeated ""(fill in the blank) Rat"" nickname for him was also a bit heavy-handed.",1412467200,,236,4.511627906976744
6578221,5,B00MHIKQB6,Awesome new Star Wars series and knowing it's in the hands of David Filoni and most of his crew from Clone Wars makes me happy knowing it will be Great.  Love the feel and tone of this show it feels like the original trilogy and a New Hope.  I like the mix of fun adventure and the dark back drop of the Empire.  Clone Wars is one of my all time favorite shows but this is a nice replacement.,1412294400,2,392,3.9367088607594938
6578222,5,B00MHIKQB6,Not sure why Amazon has a release date of October 14th 2014 which it is out at Wal-Mart now.  Just picked up my copy today October 3rd.  I am a big Star Wars fan and enjoy any type of movie or Star Wars series and loved the Clone Wars...,1412294400,,237,3.816326530612245
6578223,5,B00MHIKQB6,"Like everyone else, I was worried about Disney's Star Wars. But I'm happy to report that I was proven wrong. This movie has that Star Wars feel, that fun and suspense, that A New Hope had back in '77. This is quality stuff: If this is any indication of Star Wars' future, I'm in!",1412294400,3,279,4.185185185185185
6578224,4,B00MHIKQB6,"The Force is with Disney and Lucasfilm's first major venture together. The two powerhouses held special advanced screenings in select theaters across the country for ""Star Wars Rebels,"" which premieres October 3rd on the Disney Channel. Audience reactions to what they saw was unanimously positive and with good cause. The show completely captures the spirit and youthful charm of the original 1977 classic that started it all.

The 50-minute sneak preview shown in theaters across the country was titled Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion. It takes place between the events of Episodes III and IV and introduces a band of rebels who man the space vessel Ghost. They make it their life mission to foil the Galactic Empires plans of galactic domination. Fourteen year old orphan Ezra Bridger reluctantly joins former Padawan Kanan Jarrus, pilot Hera Syndulla, Mandalorian warrior Sabine Wren, Lasat warrior Zeb Orrelios, and astromech droid Chopper on a rescue mission to the spice mines of Kessel to free a group of Wookiee slaves. Agent Kallus of the Imperial Security Bureau leads his stormtroopers in pursuit of the motley crew.

You can tell that the producers of Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion listened to uptight fans of anything related to the prequel trilogy when taking in to consideration the direction they wanted to head in for the new series. Personally, I enjoy everything Star Wars and didn't have any problem with The Clone Wars or Episodes I through III.

The echoes of Star Wars  Episode IV: A New Hope are very much evident here. We have a young man yearning for something more from life than his aimless existence on a forgotten world in the outer rim of a galaxy far, far away. We get a band of misfits from all corners of the universe taking the boy in and giving him direction. Add to that the evil establishment who wants to rule everyone with an iron fist. Its just like all great tales of adventure and heroism, but with different characters and settings. Lets just call it what it is: Star Wars revamped for a new generation.

Familiar spaceships and figures from the original Star Wars trilogy no doubt makes longtime fans comfortable as they take in Spark of Rebellion. TIE Fighters race through space and stormtroopers follow their uniformed superiors around as they bark orders at them. The exterior and interior of the Star Destroyers also mirror the images embedded into our psyche by The Empire Strikes Back.

The animation style utilized for Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion is very much similar to that of The Clone Wars. Theyve obviously moved forward with leaps and bounds when it comes to the depth, texturing, and movements of the human characters. Its also evident that the work of original trilogy concept artist Ralph McQuarries handiwork was a huge influence on the design of the show. The evidence of that can be seen immediately in the character of Zeb, whose appearance is based on the original design of the Wookies.

The musical score for Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion also differs greatly from that of The Clone Wars. Its a return to the classic sounds of John Williams symphonic work that makes audiences want to stand up and clap in excitement every time its heard. Composer Kevin Kiner is the talent behind the series, but it sounds like hes taking all of Williams work and just rearranging it to fit new sequences of peril and drama.

Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion is Lucasfilm and Disney trying to meet the needs and expectations of three very different generations all at the same time. Returning to the original formula a young and enthusiastic film geek named George Lucas introduced the world to 37 years ago was obviously the correct direction to journey in. Its going to be fun seeing where the new show will venture and what familiar characters well get to see along the way.",1411948800,11,3863,4.842424242424243
6578225,5,B00MHIKQB6,"A excellent introduction to the new characters. My seven year old son and I watched this on watch Disney XD within moments of when it came out. I am the real ""Star Wars Nerd"" as my son calls me. (I saw the original Star Wars back in the theater when I was nine and have loved it ever since.)

We both enjoyed the playful banter that tempered the much more serious main story. Rebels is much lighter in both color and tone to the Clone Wars. While we were fans of that series, we both were ready to see a different kind of Star Wars. The colors are rich and the artwork is beautiful. Like others have commented, the animation is simpler than that of The Clone Wars but, once again, this serves to differentiate this series from its predecessor. The characters are like a family. The movie introduces each character but leaves plenty to explore.

Rebels takes place 14 years after Episode III and five years before Episode IV. It also reportedly takes place six years after A New Dawn. The Rebel Alliance has not yet formed but small cells of rebels are working independently to bring peace back to the Galaxy. The Jedi are still being hunted (by a new character named The Inquisitor.) The Empire is tightening its control over the Galaxy. And the small band of rebels aboard the Ghost are fighting back in every way they can.

NOTE: SPOILERS

While we liked all of the characters, we are especially looking forward to watching the relationship between Kanan and Ezra develop as this will be the first (and as far as we know only) Master/Padawan paring after Order 66 (and before Luke and Obi Wan/Yoda).

Overall it was a great start to our special Mom/Son night every Monday!",1411862400,39,1674,4.529801324503311
