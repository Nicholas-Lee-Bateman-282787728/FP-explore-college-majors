754274,4,6304016859,"Every woman has a story of love lost and gained. This movie does well to illustrate the loves and lives of four beautiful black women. The most touching story was Angela Bassett's because we've all been there and love can HURT. After seeing the movie for the 50th time, this movie still touches me and it's still a joy to watch every now and then. This is a girl bonding flick and sometimes it's important to realize that sisters need to stick together through ALL times. That's what this movie is all about. Though the movie is not 100% faithful to the book,it still does a great job of pulling out the aspects that made the book popular in the first place. After all these years, the movie still manages to touch me.",958003200,,718,4.406015037593985
754275,1,6304016859,"i.e. someone who knows what good acting is and it ain't hers.  Pathetic  ""viewers"" from various places who can't even give a name, we know  what type of losers they are, feel that they have to protect a movie  because of political correctness when a movie, black or white, it's just  plain bad.  A great film will speak to people regardless of race and/or  income bracket and those affected need not to have experienced what it's  like to be a black woman, by the way, I feel that a majority of black women  wouldn't say this film was a true representation of them.",956880000,10,565,4.407766990291262
754276,3,6304016859,I so agree with the viewer who said that Whitney killed this film.  It seems as if people are afraid to bad mouth her but her fakeness deserves to be joked about.  I could have easily liked this because of the other  performances but in an ensemble one bad one effects the balance and it  becomes cartoonish.  Bassett should be in way better films than the current  space film she's in.,951177600,2,386,4.366197183098592
754277,2,6304016859,"Angela Bassett and Loretta Divine are two of this countries best actresses.  However, this film had one MAJOR PROBLEM and her name is Whitney Houston.  Those studio heads with below average intelligence  thought that because Bodyguard made millions that she was a movie star.  When in actuallity all she is is a soundtrack star.  Her studio recordings  have been dismal and she is fading once again.  Her pain inducing  ""acting"" is no longer required for public consumption.  But  Angela was beautiful, wasn't she?",947116800,7,514,5.0843373493975905

754494,5,6304016859,"This was great, compared to ""romantic"" movies of 2017 or 2000's in general this was really refreshing. The array of relationships. The rage of interactions. Every character was so complete in dealing with their own problems. Problems were solved but not every end was knotted so neatly. I feel if any movie can be this one really represented what people go through. For me the characters were so complete it was easy to relate to the feelings they were expressing. When they cried I felt like crying too. I really find it hard to connect to characters in movies or books. They just are not good at establishing a connect to the character or story but this was good.",1496534400,2,665,4.5966386554621845

And yes, it is four beautiful women of color, but guess what?  Female feelings transcend color, religion, etc.  I am Irish-Catholic, 'blue-eyed soul', hehe, whatever.  Each performance is unique and amazing.  And all women can relate in some fashion.  We love deeply, and hurt deeply too.

Listen to Whitney sing, 'Why does it hurt so bad', with your eyes closed. Yes, there are many great female vocalists, but listen to that song.  The purity of her voice is gorgeous.  It's liquid, smooth, frilly.  Oh lord, just painfully beautiful.  Came across my music CD in storage and played today.  So sad as her daughter is in hospital right now.

755656,2,6304016859,"Maybe the source material was never going to produce anything of value, or maybe this is all Forest Whitakers fault, but this movie is pretty much AWFUL.  Aside from the marvelous soundtrack (which is one of the best of the 90s) and a pretty spectacular Angela Bassett, this film crumbles apart at pretty much every turn.  Nearly every character is despicable in one way, shape or form.  All this man hating, white people are the devil messaging is pretty dense when you consider that these women who are complaining about being mistreated and disregarded are, in effect, contributing to their own problems by sleeping around with married me and actively seeking them out in some instances.  I cant feel bad for these women, and Whitakers soap opera styled direction doesnt help.  Yes, there are some moments that feel genuine (the scene with Bassett and Wesley Snipes is one) but many of the emotional scenes feel forced (basically any scene with Lela Rochon) and the character development is very spotty, to the point where you don't really get to know these women despite everything that is going on around them.  The narration is regrettable and sets a tone for the film which feels extremely dated by todays standards, and the acting by most of the ensemble is mediocre at best.  Silly and preposterous and cringe worthy at many turns, Waiting to Exhale would get one star from me if it weren't for Bassett and that amazing Shoop song.",1391644800,,1440,4.805668016194332

The over protective single-mother with the ""on the down low"" ex-boyfriend (or husband -never really knew); then there is the successful single woman who gets the occasional urge to have a love of her own;next there is the doe-doe bird beauty, who believes that her sexual prowess is going to land her some successful bachelor. However, she ends up being a statistic, as many do, and getting pregnant by a married jerk! (not a man but a serious jerk!). Last, there is the dedicated wife who finds out dedication has added up to nothing in the area of love and commitment. She learned to be a trophy wife by putting her own career goals on hold the advance her husband. She is that ""Let a Man be a Man"" person we turn into when we go into denial about who we are next to instead of behind our mate.",1375142400,4,1019,4.483870967741935

One woman with a child decides to let her son grow up and be a man.  Another woman decides to become a single mother.

756141,5,6304016859,"I just LOVE this movie.  Of course now, with the passing of Whitney Houston, everyone is giving her films another look so that's why I decided to finally review it, but I have loved this movie since it first came out years ago.  It's the tale of 4 women friends in Scottsdale (I think), Arizona, who come to a personal crossroad in their lives for various reasons.  Whatever your age or personal circumstance, you can find something and someone to relate to, laugh, and cry with in this movie, its themes including healing and hope, sisterhood, and friendship.  Despite that many of the women find relationships ending, elusive, or just hopeless, and that many of the men's behavior is disappointing, I didn't see it as a male bashing vehicle. For one thing, the pain of the male behavior was a mechanism to propel the women to take charge of and change their lives. - A good thing to think about, whether it's a bad boyfriend, boss, or whatever.  Second, there actually are several wonderful male, black characters (Gregory Hines, for sure) who give us reason to believe in men, love and holding out for the real thing - no matter our age, weight, or marital status (boiling-in-divorce-angst people even have hope!).  These great men can easily be overlooked (as Gloria for awhile obsesses about her freakish, gay ex). Who hasn't done that?

I never read the book and can't speak to that, but to me the character development was full.  Even with the obvious imperfections, internal-contradictions and hypocrisy the characters demonstrated, I cared about them all  - to me, this made the film real and easy to relate to.  These are real people, flaws and all.  Although the characters are African American and I'm not, that I go back to this movie about once a year underscores how love, loss, friendship and healing transcends race and the years. This really is a winner and a sleeper.  Wonderful performances by all, very highly recommended!  (But total chick flick, not one for the guys:))",1329609600,,1992,4.7894736842105265

756146,1,6304016859,"I have not read the book. I watched this movie for the first time today. If this movie was that great to have been a book first, and then be made into a movie, then the book must have been of some quality. Unfortunately this movie is not.

I was shocked that this movie was not good; I remember they hype about it.
Firstly, it is boring. It weaves in and out of the 4 ladies lives, with not much excitement in my opinion. There are no witty lines, great acting, or an interesting storyline, and that for me, makes it very boring.

Secondly, I don't see what some are saying is great acting from Bassett and Devine. Personally, I found Bassett to be surprisingly very pretty (had not noticed it before), but her ""great scene"" of throwing her philandering husband's clothes out and burning it, seemed too forced. It basically was overacting without any real anger or passion. It was like she was afraid ""to go there."" She should of been screaming with authentic anger like Sharon Stone in Casino. I felt Bassett was just saying the lines, throwing clothes, and pouting her mouth, all hazily. The scene where all 4 friends are relaxing after Devine's B-day get together, and Bassett is smoking and cursing her ex under her breath and becomes angry, was much better acting. Probably because she acts it with subtlety.
I agree with most that Houston is not a great actress. She seems like she's thinking about the acting, and not very natural at it. Similar to Beyonce Knowles' self conscious acting in ""Obsessed"". Although Beyonce is worst than Houston.

Thirdly, the movie makes no real sense. The movie and it's characters seem confused about what it/they wants.

I've looked at The New Yorker's review of this movie, which is on this page, before submitting this review, and the critic's review is similar to mine. He mentions that the director, Whitaker, seems as confused as the characters. And the only triumph of this movie is the actual soundtrack. I very much agree.

To sum up the movie, you feel like you're watching a boring reality show of four women showing you bits of their lives; not a real movie. There isn't much development of the characters in it's 1 hour and 27 minutes. I think they (obviously) could not fit everything in the movie, and made the mistake of picking the non-essential scenes and all the scenes did not flow coherently. This movie is the prime example that some books should stay books.",1309737600,,2420,4.644859813084112

As I occasionally like ""chick flicks"", I gave it a try. First, the acting was very mechanical and distracting. The cast has a mix of experience, which may be the cause of some of this. It all felt a little theatrical, and contrived, and I was not impressed by the portrayal of the women. Several times it is remarked that a man is necessary for happiness. While I am happy for 10 years with my girlfriend, I think it sends an inappropriate message to women, generally. I am not sure this film would have even survived now, as our cultural and professional landscape and priorities have changed since then.

756208,5,6304016859,"""Waiting to Exhale"" is a film that takes you on a powerful and heartfelt excursion with four women: Bernie, Savannah, Robin and Gloria.  Each woman experiences her share of problems with the opposite sex, but through it all, they depend heavily on one another to help them through the most bleak of times.  What has proven to be the most captivating story is that of Bernie (Angela Bassett did an excellent job, as usual.)  She and her husband, John, have been married for eleven years and have two children.  In the beginning of the motion picture, though, he abruptly informs her that he is leaving her for another woman.  That information totally infuriates her and she really does some horrible things to his personal belongings.  The viewer can't help but feel sorry for her because the pain she was experiencing was written all over her face throughout the film.  Savannah (played by Whitney Houston) keeps ending up with men who use her for sex.  The man she likes the most is married.  Robin (the beautiful Lela Rochon) is extremely gullible when it comes to men.  The men she dates in this film love her and leave her, that it, until she builds up some courage to tell them how she feels.  Gloria lives with her teenaged son Tarik.  She is still attracted to his father, and when he comes to visit, she tries to be intimate with him, until he tells her that he is gay.  However, she finds love with her new next door neighbor.

 I love this film!  I cannot get enough of it.  Though it seems to be easier for women to watch, I feel that everyone can get some laughter and entertainment from it.  5 stars. Wait, where is the option for 10 stars?",1206748800,,1653,4.489932885906041
756209,3,6304016859,"I must admit that I liked this film a lot more than I thought I would. Though at times padded and overwrought, ""Exhale""  ends up being more than a sum of its parts thanks mostly to Loretta Devine, who is superb as a full-figured divorcee with a rebellious son and a gay ex husband. Though her performance is the most sublime of the four actresses, Ms. Devine is the most affecting, proving that less is more. Compared to the sparkling Ms. Devine,  the other Stars often struggle. Ms. Bassett, who is usually excellent, becomes a cliche as her husband leaves her for (gasp) a white woman and she is resigned to burning his wardrobe, destroying his car, and calling her rival the ""B"" word at her Ex's office. I can hear Oprah screaming ""You Go Girl!"" but more subtelty would be refreshing . On the other hand, Ms. Rachon is forgettable as she meanders through one worthless relationship to another, and spews lines like ""I can't resist a man with a bad stick."" Then there is Whitney Houston, who is simply out of her league. I know it's bad to speak ill of the dead, but lacking Ms. Devine's superior acting chops or Ms. Bassett's charisma, poor Whitney poses beautifully but moves her neck like a bobblehead and any second you expect her to cry out ""Crack is Whack!"" She behaves like a moron for most of the film (even using bad grammar as she admits to ""Axing"" God for help !) but finally has a moment of clarity and gives her creepy married lover his walking papers.  The men in the cast fare little better. Dennis Haysbert, as Whitney's boyfriend, has a Barry White voice and Tiger Woods morals. Wesley Snipes, who is determined to ""Stand by His Woman"" who is cancer-stricken, still manages a fling with Bassett's character. Only Gregory Hines, as a lonely widower, rises above the dreck. There was a much-reported sequel in the works that has probably died along with Houston.",1203552000,,1879,4.586309523809524

I could not understand why Bernie would burn some of her husband's belongings even the car then have garage sale with the rest, I could not understand why Gloria was hung on her very gay son's father hoping he would come back to her, I could not understand why Savannah would not hook up with the hunky fine chocolate brother...

Essentially, it is the story of four horny black women who think men are the key to happiness.

Yes, everybody craves sex at some point, some people more than others. The audience can resonate with their lust for sex, the characters' weaknesses, and minor faults. Still, after watching the movie a couple times, I realized that the characters in this film are simply naive.

I'm not trying to imply that females should be totally independent, and should never desire to date. However, they need to have standards!

Since the four characters are desperate for sex and a stable relationship, they lower their standards. This compromises their self-respect, morals and personal interests in order to ""get a man"". Obviously, they lure the sleaziest men the world has to offer. Even the four characters know that the men they're dating are worthless, as they repeat to themselves throughout the film. Nevertheless, the ladies waste time on these dogs in order to fuel they need for sex and attention.

At the end, it seems that they find more solidarity and happiness amongst each other. Though they don't seem to have fully learned from their mistakes, and seem likely to repeat the immature behavior.

To conclude, they need to breathe first, and with that added energy, they should cultivate some sense.",1169424000,4,1561,4.893939393939394

756331,3,6304016859,"Big Budget African-American movies powered by high-octane music and commercial marketing build up a product that often falters because of one red-marked reason: the product does not live up to the anticipation (The brilliant MALCOLM X represents the one exception).  WAITING TO EXHALE (WTE) does not stray from that outcome.

Like STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK and BELOVED, WTE displays all the muscles, attire, and connections for a genre-defining romantic movie along the lines of WHEN HARRY MET SALLY or FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL or even PRETTY WOMAN, but it loses credibility not because of its cast or production, but because of its convoluted storytelling.  The best love stories possess some of the very best storytelling in movie history (GONE WITH THE WIND, TITANIC, MARTY).

The story begins well, but gets bogged down when Whitney Houston's long-standing ""sometimes beau"" (the always wonderful Dennis Haysbert) pops into the picture. While in the beginning, the interlocking stories of Houston's, Bassett's, Rochon's, and Devine's characters intrigue the viewer, Houston's relationship twists/turns dominate the film's second half causing it to change its focus from multinomial to monomial.  Nothing dooms a movie away from excellence than changing foci.

If you want a well-written, enduring African-American love story, try JASON'S LYRIC, THE WOOD, THE BEST MAN, BROWN SUGAR.  Try three of the greatest of the era: BOOMERANG, STRICTLY BUSINESS, and TWO CAN PLAY THAT GAME .  Also try some great TV series (A DIFFERENT WORLD, SOUL FOOD, GIRLFRIENDS, LIVING SINGLE).

WAITING TO EXHALE diverts the attention while it plays, but in the end, you will probably remember the movie for what it really defines: a B-class movie under A-class window dressing.",1129939200,8,1762,5.355072463768116

A thin condensed version of the novel that skims the surface of the source material and gives the viewer a general overview of the actual story. This watered down movie dilutes the richness of Terry McMillan's novel and removes all the depth and substance from the characters. The key theme of women realizing that they make their own choices regarding the men in their lives is lost in the quest to commercialize black women's pain.
Angela Bassett gives a strong performance despite the weak material, however the other actors drown in this bland, homogenized movie that pushes style over subtance. A wooden Whitney Houston and a vapid Lela Rochon are horribly miscast, and Loretta Devine struggles to do her best with the weak script. The male actors with the exception of Gregory Hines, and Michael Beach cannot get past one dimension because the screenplay won't let them utilize all their acting skills. The Wesley Snipes cameo is indicative of what's wrong with this movie; it's a sellout of the original material. And that is the problem with Waiting to Exhale, a horrible script that compromises the artistic integrity of the original book. Terry McMillan and Ron Bass mistranslate a 400+ page deep novel full of three-dimensional characters, subtext and a complex plot into a shallow one-dimensional screenplay that has been sterilized for Hollywood. To really enjoy the story buy the book instead. It pulls no punches and will be far more entertaining.",1059523200,7,1534,4.99609375

This movie takes place within the course of a year - from one New Year's Eve to the next.  It's about four black women who all have relationship problems involving their black significant others, and how they pull together to provide friendship and support for each other during these relationship woes.  It would take a long time for me to describe the specifics behind their problems, but the one thing they have in common is their hatred of men, specifically black men.
The movie is an ensemble performance starring Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon.  While they each get equal billing, I enjoyed Bassett's performance them most.  She received an Oscar nomination for this role, and it was definitely well-earned.
Though the movie was advertised as a romantic comedy, it's more a movie about friendship, and how men may come and go but your friends will always be there to catch you when you fall.  This is a very nice movie, and definitely worth a look.",1044144000,2,1204,4.848780487804878

756338,4,6304016859,"Depending on who you are, Terry McMillan's 1992 novel ""Waiting to Exhale"" is either a blessing or a dreaded curse. McMillan's third novel about four African American women struggling to attain stability, identity, and normalcy in Phoenix was praised in some circles for giving contemporary Black women a much-needed voice. But in other circles, mostly male, ""Waiting to Exhale"" was ripped to shreds as a spiteful and ungrounded damnation of Black men as philanderers, deadbeats, and no-good-dooers. It also made McMillan the biggest literary target of criticsm since Alice Walker unleashed her novel ""the Color Purple."" But whatever your take on the book is, the film adaptation won't likely change your stance, as it stays overall faithful to the book. Director Forest Whitaker does a respectable job bringing to life these characters: Savannah (Whitney Houston) is the buppie still in search for Mr. Right; Bernadine (Angela Bassett) just got dumped by her husband of 11 years for a white woman; Robin (Lela Rochon) is the ditzy bimbo still trying to shake off her no-good ex, and Gloria (Loretta Devine) is the full-figured owner of a successful hair salon. The best performances, hands down, are Bassett and Devine, who make the best impressions, and they help keep the film moving at a good pace. The script, co-written by McMillan, is crisp with enough funny one-liners and a story compelling enough to keep the viewer interested. But there are flaws. Whitney Houston struggles in her role as Savannah; her performance is wooden and forced, and when paired against a seasoned pro like Bassett, she flat out crumbles. A more relaxed approach to the material would have helped. Also, memo to Black filmmakers: drop the swishy gay hairdresser stereotype! It's tired, done a million times before, and, frankly, is grossly out of touch with reality. That aside, it's not often that a movie successfully adapts a novel as well as this one, and ""Waiting to Exhale,"" warts and all, merits a B in my school of cinema.",1033257600,24,2014,5.032934131736527

Not only had I never experienced any kind of mature, adult relationship, the racial issues that arise in their argument were completely foreign to me. The husband tells Bassett that he is in love with his secretary and is leaving Bassett for the secretary. Bassett angrily asks, ""Is she white?"" The husband asks, ""Why? Would it be better if she were black?"" Bassett retorts, ""No, but it would be better if you were."" However, when I saw it again when I got older, I found that the film was warm, funny, vengeful, true to life and universal. I guess this is the trick of making a film that features an almost all black cast. People who are not black might not see it because they feel like they are watching something outside their own experience, and yes, in many ways, like it or not, they are. However, the stories told here transgress a solely ""black"" experience and become a universally female experience. And even a human one. We all experience pain, loss, insecurity, self-doubt, and we turn to our friends to get through those times. Sometimes, as in the film, our friends lead totally different lifestyles from the ones we lead. The film actually portrays these women in a way that breaks stereotypes and focuses on how real people might deal with their real feelings. Or in the case of Angela Bassett setting her soon-to-be-ex-husband's car on fire in the driveway, well, maybe none of us would really do that, but I am sure we have all felt like it. Overall this was a well-acted, well-done film with universal themes.",1000339200,73,1866,4.589820359281437
756440,3,6304016859,"I did not buy this movie for myself...In fact, the only reason I bought it was because someone I was seeing at the time mentioned the movie to which I responded, ""Oh I absolutely love that movie."" I bought the movie the next day on Amazon.com and watched it two nights later. I was not disappointed. It is not the greatest movie of all time, but it was a good peek into the fast paced world of the successful black woman. Success comes at its costs, as told through this movie: whether abandonment, feelings of worthlessness, or just plain old loneliness, this movie deals with them all. I think this movie is a treat for viewers regardless of their ethnicity or gender.",998870400,,670,4.5
756441,4,6304016859,"I got to see this movie on HBO for the first time, and I had to get the  VHS, then the DVD, and I still watch it like if it is a brand new film. The most outstanding aspect of this movie is the presence of Angela Basset, who proves again after ""What's love got to do with it"", that she's one of the best actresses walking on Hollywood. It is amazing the way she suffers, cries, screams, smiles, I mean everything about her in this movie leaves a mark. The message that this movie brings is beautiful, in fact it is stunning 'till the end, and watching how this four women overcome their mistakes and bad times is pretty much inspiring to anyone. This is the kind of movie that doesn't bores you in any part of it.",998179200,,713,4.129496402877698
756442,2,6304016859,"This movie was too sappy, even for me.  For those who say it's pretty much a chick-flick?  Perhaps for the ""chicks who live for men club"", maybe, but not for this chick.  It was like bathing in Masengil...",997920000,2,205,4.342105263157895
756443,3,6304016859,"While this wasn't a bad movie, I was personally disappointed.  After reading the book, I couldn't wait for the movie to be filmed.
I think the movie characters lacked the depth that the book characters did.  I realize that certain things have to be edited out to make this a feature length  but certain things could have  been left in.  The character of Samantha lacked the spunk that I expected.  The character of Robin, came across as very shallow (while that was the gist of her charcter, the love of her family was not mentioned).  The movied appeared to be the ""man bashing"" item the book had been dubbed.
I think the performances were quite memorable, especially Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine.  I think Whitney Houston was a terrible casting move.  I think a more talented actress would have been better suited for this movie.",995241600,4,836,4.710344827586207
756444,3,6304016859,"In my opinion, WAITING TO EXHALE is a sweet, funny, heart-warming, touching, and romantic movie. I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE HARD TRUTH) looked VERY beautiful in their fancy dresses. The dress that I liked the most was the one that Bernadine was wearing at the beginning of the film, which was when John (Michael Beach), her husband of 11 years, told her that he was leaving her for Kathleen (Kelly Preston), his bookkeeper. When I saw Bernadine lying awake, in her bed, crying, I thought that she looked VERY beautiful. In addition, I was deeply touched. This was because she had just been jilted by her husband. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts REALLY made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT. If you are a fan of Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Lela Rochon, or Loretta Devine, I HIGHLY recommend this movie.",994291200,,1254,4.62780269058296
756445,5,6304016859,"When you want to invite your sistas over for a girls night out, you should watch this movie! I love the fact that every woman had their own problems and that, instead of sitting around moping about it, they did something! This did not put the usual stereotype on black women as some other movies may have. I was tired of seeing all of these female-bonding movies with white women. Without this movie, ""Soulfood"" might not have never been made.",980985600,,443,4.55
756446,4,6304016859,"I can identify with many of the issues in this movie because for most African American women, these things are a reality.  I thought the acting on Angela Bassett's and all the supporting actresses'/actors' parts were great, however Whitney does need help.  I love her (singing) voice but she should consider taking some acting lessons. I've seen this movie at least 10 times and every time, it does a work for my emotions.  I know it appears to bash men, but this is REAL.  Most men that I've met are the same way.  I also spent 11 years in a marriage that I thought was fine and what do you know, he turns out to be a REAL jerk.  Overall, I really liked the movie, highly recommend it and think it is a great example of a friendship shared between four strong, smart, African American women.",978307200,2,792,4.390410958904109
