8313607,1,B0018X2KKQ,"There was no description of this tape when I purchased it and under the circumstances certainly no seller would feel compelled to volunteer the following information: This tape is a whopping 23 minutes long. TWENTY-THREE MINUTES.

There are two episodes:

""That's No Buffalo, Bill""
""The Doc Collapses""

On the box is written ""approximate running time 30 minutes"" (off by only seven minutes). Also listed on the box are the two episode titles, followed by the words ""and more."" The ""and more"" turns out to be a couple of minutes of grainy blank tape after the second episode. There isn't more. Just two episodes, followed by a few minutes of blank tape.  A 23-minute rip-off.",1283299200,5,674,4.885964912280702
