5670895,4,B00BT0FUQO,"from the view of local UFO groups and contactees, you were able to get a feel for the characters and state of mind at play. It moves at a slower pace but with that you get insight. It has soul and was put together well.",1394236800,2,219,3.888888888888889
5670896,5,B00BT0FUQO,"I had the pleasure of screening this documentary at the 2013 EBE Film Festival in Arizona a few months back, and was very pleased with it. The production quality is top-notch, and the content is extremely intriguing. This is miles ahead of most UFO-related documentaries and deserves serious attention.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone with even the slightest interest in a phenomenon that continues to make itself more mainstream and acceptable in today's hectic world.",1365033600,3,478,5.207792207792208
5670897,5,B00BT0FUQO,"Are you curious to learn what people have to say about their first-hand experience of seeing a strange, unknown aircraft before their eyes?  This documentary follows Linda Zimmermann as she interviews several witnesses from different social demographics to see what she can learn about the long-time history of UFO sightings in the Hudson Valley, NY area. There is something undeniable about watching people from all walks of life explaining their personal, incredible, life-altering experiences.  At the end of the film you are left with a touching narration by Linda describing how this journey has shifted her understanding, and compassion towards the numerous people who've had an experience, and indignation for those who've played a part in maligning and ridiculing these people.  I also found it quite interesting to go along and watch as they explored a few rock chambers in the local area, specifically the ""King's Chamber"". This is a double DVD set, with ""Special Features"" giving you the chance to learn more about the UFO World, the Stone Chambers, and watch additional footage of the endearing interviews with witnesses.  Great addition to any DVD collection!  Winner of the ""People's Choice Award"" at the ""2013 EBE FILM FESTIVAL""",1365033600,2,1243,5.257575757575758
5670898,5,B00BT0FUQO,"I had the honor of screening this documentary at the IUFOC 2013 Film Festival where it won the audience choice award--and for good reason! Please take the time to watch this all the way through. It has incredible research and a great balance of skepticism so you KNOW that what they are telling you is true. Artistically done, well developed, and an absolute joy to watch!",1364342400,,372,4.651515151515151

5670900,4,B00BT0FUQO,"I couldn't believe it when I saw that the ""Flying V"" from the early 1980s had its own documentary! Although production values are rather low, the interviews and information presented went far deeper than I had ever thought. In Spring of 1983 or 1984, I was driving home from a friends' house in Pawling, NY on Route 22 south and as I approached Brewster and I-84, I was coming down a hill with a supermarket at the bottom ... Then I suddenly saw ""it"". At first, it looked like an enormous string of Christmas lights in the sky, but it looked to be so wide that it filled nearly half the sky. I pulled into the market and noticed everyone in the parking lot was looking up and pointing to it. At this moment, it was directly overhead and looked like a boomerang-shaped series of incredibly bright halogen lights. I could barely believe what I was seeing and began to note the characteristics. It didn't make any noise, but I seem to remember a low ""harmonic"" that was practically inaudible. As it moved away, traveling south to north and drifting slowly, it went beyond the tree line and the bright white lights turned into multi-colored lights. I got in the car and chased it when it began to drift out of sight, but it suddenly seemed to be going too fast to catch up with. I told everyone I knew and they mostly gave me the ""Yeah! Right!"" look and comments of disbelief. This was no conventional aircraft, or ultralights or ""weather balloons"" ... This was for real and has become a legend that I tell nieces and nephews. Now, my interest has been awakened once more. Great stuff!",1424217600,2,1581,4.474048442906574
5670901,3,B00BT0FUQO,"The music seemed as if it was made in an insane asylum, or for an insane asylum. The awful piano music was unrelenting, cheapened the testimony of the witnesses, and seemed to make a mockery of the subject matter. The film was slow getting started and had the feel of a low budget Food Network show for a low end time slot. The editing and camera work was shoddy.",1419292800,,363,4.27536231884058

5670906,1,B00BT0FUQO,I did not like it at all. The people in the homemade video looked weird and were totally unconvincing. You saw the same people over and over again. Yuck!,1409443200,,153,4.310344827586207
5670907,5,B00BT0FUQO,"A unique DIY / grass roots approach UFO documentary with an honest naivety toward the subject of aliens and UFOs that progresses in a way that mirrors the common journey of anyone looking into the subject with an open mind. The film ultimately proposes that something is happening that contradicts our traditional world view. Considering our traditional world view compartmentalizes everything outside our planet into a small scientific box, humans are undoubtedly in store for a major revelation when we are forced to confront other intelligent species that may have advanced millions, if not billions of years beyond us. It's an important subject that we should all be talking about, and if you conclude that they are of demonic origin like many are proposing, I encourage you to weigh your thoughts and feelings against a reality that this is something clearly beyond our ability to comprehend quickly, and not jump to dangerous and negative conclusions about an aspect of nature we clearly need time to fully understand to the best of our human intellect.",1408838400,3,1059,5.091954022988506
5670908,5,B00BT0FUQO,"I watched the film ""Night Sky : I Recall a UFO"" last night.  I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed it.  Linda Zimmerman did a wonderful job. She was warm, friendly and honest throughout the whole film.  The guests were treated with dignity.  There was no misleading or sensationalized nonsense.  Truly, one of the very best films of this type I have seen.  Ms. Zimmerman didn't get into a bunch of 'technical' stuff that so many others use to try and qualify their presentation.  This film was just clean, clear and honest.  I really liked it very much.",1408320000,2,555,4.48
5670909,2,B00BT0FUQO,Definitely not a documentary but as another reviewer already mentioned it's a compilation of testimonials.  Even though this just came out in 2014 many of the cases referenced are from the 80's and 90's so not much new information.  There are other better documentaries available on Prime that are free so save your money on this one if you're a Prime subscriber...,1408147200,2,365,4.870967741935484
5670910,5,B00BT0FUQO,"Once again the powers that would be continue to divulge the obvious reality we are being visited, or we have been covertly invaded.  There is no sense in hiding it any more, the powers that would be are telling us 'they are here' What can we do, they are slowly letting us know what our new reality is.....We have lost control and power of our world to a Civilization who appear to be more advanced in every sense of the word and have invaded our world. Given the rash of movies, documentaries 'based on true accounts' and the world wide reporting of UFO's who can deny this reality any longer.....and the funny thing is....we are powerless against a for who are light years ahead of us. We have been invaded....",1405123200,,712,4.476923076923077

5670912,3,B00BT0FUQO,"Like the baby Bear said this is interesting without being captivating.  Much of it I had either heard or read about before, but this anthology of accounts does assemble the inidividual stories into a whole not seem before, which makes it a fair tool for studying some older accounts into a complete compendium!",1403308800,,310,4.849056603773585
5670913,4,B00BT0FUQO,"I have to say I figured this was going to be ""another UFO"" documentary. What I enjoyed about this report is that the author respected all interviewees and everyone was ""normal"" Americans and very upfront about what they've seen. Let's face it, Hudson Valley is smack in the middle of New England ""prove it to me"" type of folks. I enjoyed this video and would recommend it for a different perspective on an always interesting subject.",1401235200,,433,4.7105263157894735
5670914,4,B00BT0FUQO,"This book and accompanying DVD reveal more subjective evidence that we are not alone.  It is a fun and fascinating romp through this strange phenomenon.  No ridiculous claims are made; the many sightings by Hudson Valley inhabitants are presented in an objective manner, leaving much to the reader.  For those who wish to enrich their knowledge of what some people have seen and are seeing in the night sky, these items ill hit the bullseye.",1400544000,,441,4.8533333333333335
5670915,5,B00BT0FUQO,"Just loved this film.  The lake sighting with the ladies was incredible.  That in itself was worth watching the film.  Just can't make that stuff up.  Could have left out the troubled fellow toward the end.  But I totally understand the need to give him a hearing.  He is not alone in his convictions.

Overall, a delightful and chilling display of the effects of the ET presence and THEIR on-going ability to infiltrate culture on a variety of levels.  THEY are here.  The USGov is playing our citizens like a fiddle.  Period.",1398297600,,527,4.630434782608695

5670917,4,B00BT0FUQO,"Being from north Jersey, I remember back in the early eighties seeing the nightly news reports about the strange light formations in the night sky in the Hudson valley area. The reports were treated seriously insofar as the observers of the phenomenon were people from all walks of life.  So it is fascinating that Ms. Zimmerman wrote this interesting book.  I recall reading two other books on the subject many years ago, but this book seems to breath fresh life into the unresolved events and look at it from a very pragmatic angle.  The tone of the book is very sensible and rational and easy reading.  I would say it is worth reading for the uninformed as well as the avid fan of the subject.",1395705600,,696,4.544
5670918,3,B00BT0FUQO,"This is an interesting documentary that explores the historic Hudson Valley UFO sightings of the mid 80's. The film makers return to interview people who came forward 25 years ago to report their sightings of a massive triangular UFO that is noted in other UFO documentaries.  The documentary is straightforward and generally steers away from sensationalism.  Unlike many of the new Searching for UFO/Supernatural reality shows, this one is less hysterical and actually provides a better sense of what was going on in the Hudson River Valley at the time. A worthwhile film if you are interested in UFO history.",1395705600,2,610,5.09
8573455,5,B00BT0FUQO,"This documentary focuses on the Hudson River Valley in upstate New York. There is little to doubt when you've got multiple unrelated witnesses describing the same or silmilar occurrences. And there was one guy who was quite obviously traumatized, you could just see it in his gestures and disposition. I sure wish this would become available again, or can be watched elsewhere.",1500249600,,377,5.096774193548387

8573460,3,B00BT0FUQO,"They mention these stone chambers in video. The Cherokee use to build these little houses, I don't know what they would build them out of, and
they would build a fire in the center and stay in them in the winter to stay warm. The Cherokee are descendants of the Iroquoi, maybe they learned it from them. I believe that is what they are, they called them hot houses and they would kind of store up all their food for the winter and sorta hybernate in the winter. They also may be tombs for their kings, they didn't have chiefs they had kings, I don't know where the chief thing came from. Not sure the Iroquoi inhabited that region. That's what those chambers reminded me of, they would cover the entrance and build a little fire and stay all toasty warm in their.",1459209600,,763,4.3426573426573425

8573463,1,B00BT0FUQO,"I was duped by the high ratings and rave reviews into wasting time and money on this whatever it is.

This is a home movie, or at best something you'd see on public access television.

The filmmaker is always in the shot, often looking into the areas of the sky that the interviewees point to while telling their bland stories of UFO's they saw 30 years prior.

I'm not hard to please, especially in this subject. I feel that I could get the same or better product simply by putting an ad on craigslist for people who have seen UFOs, interview them, have it edited, and put it on Amazon for my friends to rate it 9/10, fooling others into believing their must be something really good about my ""documentary"".",1438905600,3,708,4.430769230769231
