8588102,1,B00D06Q5BE,"I saw the original series on NHK with the English subtitles, loved this mini series drama.  This copy came to my door in good time but the video quality is mediocre- looks like it was copied off a VHS tape.  The English subtitle was even worse- looks like someone just ran a translator through it. Some of the translation doesn't even make sense!  If there were zero stars, I would give it that.  Most likely a PIRATED copy that got by Amazon quality control.",1376179200,,459,4.428571428571429
