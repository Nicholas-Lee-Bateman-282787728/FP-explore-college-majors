8632520,1,B00HFTTZZA,This movie has some awesome images and I had high hopes because of Miles Szanto. The script is disjointed and the intensity of some of the performances don't make sense. The bonus features explained the magnitude of the effort to make this movie.,1488499200,,246,4.744186046511628
8632521,4,B00HFTTZZA,"Earlene is at that stage in her life where she needs a break, she runs into free minded Bruno who has an unusual way of earning money and despite their age difference and backgrounds; they sort of hit it off. Then after getting up to drunken shenanigans, they decide to head off to the desert to find themselves - and get a bit lost too.

Anyway along the road they meet Billy who likes to carry on as if he was in one of those Diet Coke ads where all the women get all girly when a window cleaner pops by. They head off for nowhere and find a kind of ram shackle town full of societal drop outs and people on the more colourful side of life. The two Scottish lads are brilliant. It is the sort of place I would like to get lost in - an absolute riot.

This is a sort of road trip, self discovery and quite gay in places, and I have to say I really enjoyed it, but mainly because it just seemed like a breath of fresh air, it has funny moments, touching moments and a full array of emotions. Some of the acting is a bit wanting, but it matters not a jot as the whole package is just so much fun. This is one to see again and again - highly recommended.",1446249600,2,1152,3.961206896551724
