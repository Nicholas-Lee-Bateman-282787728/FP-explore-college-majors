8519474,5,B007M0CYSC,Received this disc as a present. Great views of the landscapes in Alaska during the different seasons of the year. We love the wildlife in Alaska and there are some of the most beautiful photos of mammals and birds of Alaska that we've ever seen. We also purchased the Thailand Enchanted Kingdom blu-ray disc by the same company from Amazon (great video as well.) Highly recommend both.,1374192000,,386,4.776119402985074
