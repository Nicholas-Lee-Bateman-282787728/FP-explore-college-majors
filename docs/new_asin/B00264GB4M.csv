8351944,5,B00264GB4M,I've binge watched all the sets available on Region 1 DVD. Why can't we get set 7 thru 12 - the other half of the series - on Region 1 DVD?  While I can watch Region 2 DVDs on my iMAC - what happens when the new iMAC is released without a DVD player?  Get it together!  The Brits do police  series so much better than America!,1504656000,,326,3.8208955223880596

8351949,5,B00264GB4M,"After a few episodes that left viewers wondering if TRIAL & RETRIBUTION had lost its edge, Acorn Media presents the last four episodes of the hit British series (all two-parters). Happily, these four feature-length dramas are all excellent.

The first story is called Tracks and features a scary-looking Roy Marsden as one of the principle characters. Marsden is perhaps best know as P.D. James intrepid policeman Adam Dalgliesh in a series of television adaptations of James popular novels. He is quite the opposite character here with his shaven head and hard edge.

From the first sequence of a dead body in the rain and mud, it is clear that TRIAL & RETRIBUTION is back. Giving the show that extra zip (to balance with the graphic content) are some wonderfully funny lines which pop up unexpectedly. Giving up smiling for Lent? one dour-faced individual is asked. Or when a young thief who is trying to explain why he is in possession of some stolen items bearing the name Maria (he claims that is HIS name) is confronted with Maria? Your mum like The Sound of Music or something?

David Hayman is his usual hard-nosed self, though I have to admit he has the occasional moment where his performance isn't convincingvery rare for this fine actor. Rest assured he still bites the filters off his cigarettes. Victoria Smurfit is much more palatable in this series of episodes than the previous shows when her hardness made her very unlikeable. Here she shows some vulnerability and her relationship with Haymans Mike Walker is more interesting, in part because they seem to actually care about one another. Smurfits Roisin Connor also reveals some good judgment in her personal life (for a change) as she contemplates becoming involved with a colleague, indicating that her character is maturing. An interesting side note is that Roisin is often lit in such a way as to show her bad skin, something youd never see in a U.S. cop drama. This touch keeps her real and in some ways enhances her flaws, making it easier for the viewer to relate to her.

Dorian Lough continues to be as fine a supporting actor in a police drama as Ive ever seen as Satch. You know the type of role: large supporting part, always on hand to assist the stars, do the leg work and get yelled at when things go awry. Hes wonderful in the role. (Lough also narrates the outstanding behind the scenes featurettes that accompany three of the tales). Lough is particularly good in the last episode, Shooter, which leaves his future with the police force up in the air, something that will never be resolved now that the series is over. As it stands, the viewer is left to wonder if Satch will remain with the force and become as single-minded about his work as his boss, Mike Walkerto the detriment of a fulfilling domestic lifeor will his new-born baby represent a rebirth in his own life and career. We will never know but the fact that we wonder about it is proof that TRIAL & RETRIBUTION has wound its way into our hearts.

Story number three, Ghost Train takes place in a carnival setting, and features a wonderful tribute to Christoper Lee as Dracula, whose menacing fang-filled face looms down from the titular Ghost Train ride. Its great to see Roisin Connor (Victoria  Smurfit) having fun as she and Vince Leigh as her associate Palmer are seen in a montage sequence enjoying the many distractions the carnival has to offer. Mention must be made of the great Jane Lapotaire in this episode as well, playing a very convincing fortuneteller. Ms Lapotaire, whose brilliant stage career, which included winning a Tony award on Broadway for her definitive portrayal of singer Edith Piaf, suffered a cerebral haemorrhage in 2000 and has slowly made her way back into acting. She is as riveting here as she ever was.

Ghost Train also includes some outstanding stunt work.

All four episodes (episode two is called Siren and features Vincent Reagan) are worthy additions to the TRIAL & RETRIBUTION legacy, with episode four in particular being a real nail-biter. If there is room for any criticism about this series at all it is perhaps the over-reliance on making a character secretly gay as a major plot point. This has been used to excess on TRIAL & RETRIBUTION (and other shows) and runs the danger of appearing as much as a political statement as a plot point. When audiences start guessing such twists correctly, its time to move on to something else.

Perhaps then it is fitting that TRIAL & RETRIBUTION end here. Always engrossing, sometimes brilliant, occasionally frustrating, to end now means leaving the viewer wanting more, and that is never a bad thing.",1397433600,,4640,4.782771535580524
