8251265,5,B0013JHLGS,"This is an outstanding movie.  It is a western, filmed and set about as far east as there is.  If you like the works of Clint Eastwood, then you will love Sweet Country.  Replace the American desert Southwest with the Australian Outback.  Replace Native Americans with Indigenous Australians.  Replace cowboys with British colonial soldiers.  Replace Clint Eastwood with Sam Neill.

Sweet Country belongs with all of the great westerns.  I eagerly await the US playable Blu-Ray edition.",1524873600,,486,5.220779220779221
8251266,5,B0013JHLGS,"many people hate this movie, and consider it a sort of mistake in Cacoyannis'career. Mistake is not see what is going on in this terrible, dark,moment of Latin America history. Beeing a latin american myself this movie deeply moves me for its truth that it contains. It is heavy, no doubt, but could be another way of telling this events? This film is as important as Z,Burn, Walker,and so on. The cast is superb",1216166400,,412,4.581081081081081
