777556,1,6304048017,"These reviews that claim this movie is so bad its good are going way overboard with that one. This movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli had. Those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful. I haven't been in this much pain watching a bad movie since I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I start the review let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a $35 million dollar bust The New Line Cinema refused to put in theaters. They cut the losses sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straight-to-video movie in decades. Whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck.

Plot: a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill mankind and start another Ice Age. A female cop named Katie Coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named Theodore Rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaur.

The plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which robs the movie of all its mystery. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful. Whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail. Theodore Rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tail(on accident and on purpose). I thought Burglar was bad but it takes a backseat to Theodore Rex: the worst movie of Whoopi's career.

Dont let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable. I didn't see that when I watched this movie. All I saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie Howard The Duck. The humor is on that level and Theodore Rex looks like the inbred cousin of Barney. Utterly painful from start to finish.",1238198400,4,1950,4.502824858757062
777557,5,6304048017,"This flic is high in the running for worst movie ever.  If you are a fan of the cinematic disaster this film is every bit the contemporary of Battle Field Earth, Leonard Part 6, etc.  You really feel sorry for Whoopie Goldberg (whom desperately did not want to make this movie -- she was forced to in a lawsuit).

Also makes a great gag gift :)",1231113600,11,344,4.181818181818182

777559,5,6304048017,"Watching this film sober - and even under the influence - is like giving birth out of your ear while simultaneously having a stroke, getting a root canal, and walking in on your parents having sex. In your bed. And as you walk in on them, you step on a rake and it hits you in the face and drives a splinter into your eye.

Yet at the same time it triggers a visceral, masochistic response somewhere deep inside, and you can't help but take pleasure in every mind-numbing attempt at a joke, every sudden idiotic plot twist, and every glimpse of Whoopi's gross spandexed rumpus.

A real treat.",1181433600,55,592,4.422018348623853

The effects are good though as well as one would expect for a 35 million dollar ""direct to video"" release...(To this day it is the most expensive movie made that has never played in a theater) I think Joel Shumacher aka ""I killed Batman"" could have done a better job if he were the director of this peice of bovine waste and that is saying a lot...aw screw it it would have been another reel of gay porn much like Batman Returns.......",1115424000,3,577,4.392523364485982

777642,1,6304048017,"Theodore Rex is bad on every level.  It has no redeemable qualities about it.  Even if you watched it in the 90's I can't see it being fun.  The plot is full of holes.  The main protagonist Kane, is supposed to be akin to Noah, is responsible for bringing back the dinosaurs, and his master plan is to launch a rocket into space and bring a second ice age so he can rule the world...no joke.

***Spoiler Alert*** or consider this me saving you an hour and a half of your life.

Teddy Rex is a recovering carnivore that now survives on cookies.  They make no mention to the fact that Teddy is a 1/16 the size of a real T-Rex.  Whoopi Goldberg is the biggest name in the cast and someone decided it was a good idea to make her a cyborg detective who wears spandex.  Teddy and Whoopi get teamed up to solve the murder of another T-Rex who was killed by an exploding butterfly, made by an eccentric Asian man named the ""Toy Maker"".  I'll just stop here.  After some research I found out that the director of this atrocity retired from making films before this one was even directly released to video....good riddance.",1419206400,7,1113,4.328502415458937

I had a hard time finding this movie.  No place around where I live have it.  I had to come here to buy it.  Maybe if it would have been promoted better, and marketed better, it would have been more popular.

It was cute, and almost good enough for kids to watch.  Parents should check it out first.

At this price, it is a great deal!  I would have paid more just to have it, if I would have had to.

I think people underrate Whoopi, she has a lot of talent, and brings so much to a film.  Okay, so it was a little cheesy, so what.  IF you were a real Whoopi fan, it wouldn't bother you.",1379376000,2,694,3.949275362318841

It's relatively enjoyable to watch if your expectations are not too high-- mostly because the movie can't seem to decide what it is. It can't make up its mind if it's aimed at kids (which it seems marketed to?) or to adults (The themes are pretty mature and dark). The dinosaur characters' costumes and sets are really well done, and it's easy to see how this movie could be the most expensive straight-to-video film ever. I would have loved to have seen how it would have come out if it had been handled as a primarily more mature science fiction movie, in the same vein as the Anonymous Rex novels.

It is my assumption that if you are here, you have already discovered this movie elsewhere and now are looking it up on Amazon. So there's no reason to summarize this. If you are here you are a fan of bad films - no question. If I am correct you will like this film.

-Most of the actors signed on thinking the dinosaur would be computer enhanced.

-Crew members left constantly during production. Whoopi Goldberg once said that on her final day of shooting, 99% of the crew was different from the first day.

-Whoopi Goldberg wanted to leave the film during the production.

-Intended for theatrical release. The finished film was so bad that the studio decided to cut their losses and sent it straight to video, making it the most expensive straight-to-video film ever at the time of its release.

-Jonathan R. Betuel retired from directing after this film. He felt the studio didn't market it correctly.

If these facts do not want to make you buy it right now - you will not enjoy this film. Otherwise, buy it right now you will not be disappointed.",1346198400,5,1106,4.532663316582915
777699,1,6304048017,"""Theodore Rex"" is the movie that should have ended Whoopi Goldberg's career: it's abysmal on every level, and was an extremely costly disaster for New Line Cinema. Although the intention was to release the film theatrically, the test screenings revealed such a hostile reception that the decision was made to send the $33 million picture direct to video. It was such a catastrophe that director Jonathan Betuel retired from directing after its release. For her part Whoopi attempted to back out of the deal, but legal entanglements ensued (no pun intended) and she agreed to do the part for a reported $7 million, though it's clear from her onscreen presence that she detested every minute of it. The overriding question I quickly formulated was ""Who on Earth green-lighted this?""

The plot kicks off with a complicated prologue explaining how billionaire Elizar Kane (Armin Mueller-Stahl) wants to launch his New Eden missile to start a new ice age, so he can rule the world (of course.) Juliet Landau as Dr. Veronica Shade and the always offbeat Bud Cort as Spinner are the other chief architects of mayhem here. Saving the bizarre alternate reality version of Earth presented here, Katie Coltrane (Goldberg) is a world-weary and decidedly grumpy future cop clad in black leather who is paired up in a dinocide investigation with Theodore Rex (voiced by George Newbern,) an implausibly clumsy (oh the hilarity of the wayward tail) and dimwitted dino-cop. Together they uncover much more than expected, resulting in 92 minutes of pain for viewers. From the very outset the film is disastrous: if the opening action scene doesn't make sense to you, it's not you. There's also a terrible romance between Teddy and Molly Rex (voiced by Carol Kane!) who is a dancer at the Extinct Species Club. I was dumbfounded to see that grumpy police commissioner Lynch was played by the talented tough guy Richard Roundtree. Gasp!

The dialogue is ponderous from the outset (imagine a dinosaur imitating James Bond saying ""Rex. T. Rex."" for starters) and talk about Katie being ""speciesist"" (humans are called ""softskins"") which is apparently an attempt to sandwich a bit of contemporary political correctness into the movie as a comedic allegory. (Note: this is wholly unsuccessful, and the film has set back progress in human-dinosaur relations several million years.) Oh did I mention that it's also a morality play as Teddy refuses to carry a weapon because he ""doesn't believe in violence."" No opportunity is wasted to remind viewers of the subtle hilarity of the premise: Teddy takes Katie to a dinner of hydroponic seaweed and krill (yes this tyrannosaurus does not eat meat, but instead is addicted to cookies); Carol Kane sings in her dinosaur persona, Teddy tries out undercover costumes in one of the most repellant sequences ever filmed, they ride around in an official police garbage truck (oh, my ribs!), Teddy plays field hockey with his tail, there's a poor urban kid who has a special place in Katie's heart for some reason, and finally Teddy imitates Elvis (""Thank you very much!"") and even worse, Whoopi speaks with a British accent. This is merely a warm-up for Teddy's terrible impressions. If your head is reeling, let me make it clear that mere words cannot do this movie justice.

The murderer is a clone registered to New Eden (well that makes perfect sense because...well, never mind...) and at the funeral of the deceased dinosaur a giant fly plays the bongos. OK, so it turns out it's not a giant fly, it's a dinosaur that looks like a giant fly, but you get the picture. Dialogue worsens as running time elapses: ""Was I hatched yesterday?"", ""I didn't butt trumpet!"", and ""You can't eat our only suspect!"" spring immediately to mind. To save the world Katie and Teddy have to enter ""the ninja grid,"" deal with explosive insects, fly an ultralight helicopter, negotiate with kidnappers, and confront horrifying violence as the movie swerves yet again to suddenly become an anti-gun flick as the eternal battle between ""softskin versus scale"" is played out, resulting in a wholly predictable conclusion that's guaranteed to annoy.

That ""Theodore Rex"" features a genuinely talented cast (from Goldberg, Roundtree, and Cort to vocal luminaries like Kane, Rodger Bumpass, and Phil Proctor) is undeniable. That their talents were utterly squandered is also undeniable. The DVD doesn't have many extras, the trailer being chief among them, not that I would have sat through this again to listen to anyone explain to me why this was an underappreciated piece of genius if there had been a commentary track. At the end there's a credit reading ""This Film is Dedicated to Lorenzo Ferrari."" What on Earth did Ferrari ever do to anyone to deserve that?

If you thought ""Howard the Duck"" was the worst anthropomorphic animal and human movie ever made, think again. This one is a unique brand of awful that is hard to describe. It would, however, be an excellent gift for someone who believes they can withstand any bad movie. Just make sure you don't make the mistake of offering to watch it with them. Plan to be in another country just to play it safe.",1330992000,7,5156,4.94919168591224
777700,5,6304048017,"Turning Edmund Morris's 500+ page book on the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt into a 90-minute feature film was surely a Herculean task, but the makers of ""Theodore Rex"" rose to the occasion.  Granted, some things are lost in translation, such as Roosevelt's masterful handling of the coal miners' strike, and his controversial actions in regards to securing the Panama Canal, but for the most part, the important details (talking dinosaurs) remain intact.  A wonderful tribute to the life and accomplishments of our 26th president.",1316476800,164,533,5.333333333333333

That said, I disagree with people who say, ""It's so bad it's good."" If that is true, you should be giving it one star. People who want bad movies are looking for one-star films.

And people who think ""poor Whoopi"" should remember 1) She cashed the check, 2) She lives in a mansion, and 3) Stars are associated with the properties they are in, and that's part of the arrangement she knew about and has profited from, so it is fair to hold her accountable for junk like this. In doing this movie she was ripping off moviegoers, even if she didn't think so. This is a comment on soft-hearted reviewers, not the movie.

Still, I got my money's worth in renting a wretched piece of Hollywood excrement on purpose to laugh at it.",1255478400,2,837,4.387096774193548

""Theodore Rex"" is about a talking dinosaur who eats only cookies . . . COOKIES?! Did they have to make it all so kid-friendly?! Well, I guess so, since this film does look like it was targeted for people under the age of 6. Anyway, Theodore pairs up with Whoopie, who stars as a fearless detective, into finding out who's killing innocent dinosaurs here and there.

Forget about the plot. Forget about the characters. In fact, forget about this entire movie. There's nothing good going here. Even the music goes to waste. Not as awful as Batman and Robin, but it's still awful in many levels.
