4599637,5,B0058KIEMI,"This film is absolutely amazing. It gives the point of view from normal people who were living in extraordinary times. As an American I was baffled by what I saw and heard in the film about what these individuals thought of Americans when they were young and there are so many parallels that can be drawn between their thoughts and ours. They wanted peace and global security. I think anyone even mildly interested in Russian culture will enjoy this film. Even if you aren't that interested in the culture, just watch it for the history or the story. It's truly fascinating.",1309305600,14,574,4.693069306930693
4599660,4,B0058KIEMI,"The only reason I gave it four stars and not five is because if you're not Russian who lived through some of the times that are described there, it will be difficult for you to follow what is happening. It was easy for me since I spent 19 years of my life there and I could certainly follow the events, but for a foreigner I think it will be a bit challenging. But still a great documentary with real people, real footage and real, sometimes even sad humor. Highly recommend it!",1388707200,,478,4.263736263736264

Something that showed the macro, the powerful leaders grappling with changing a sclerotic, failed system and then follow with commentary by ordinary people  but this largely omits the macro and leaves ordinary Russians represented by a divorcee, a former punk rocker, a shirt boutique owner and a married couple who teach - mediocre at best.",1359849600,,514,4.908045977011494

4599664,4,B0058KIEMI,"Robin Hessman's My Perestroika (2010) does not fail to shock viewers with an unexpected look at both the late Soviet era and present day Russia respectively. Following the day to day lives of five former classmates who grew up in Moscow in the 1970s, My Perestroika effortlessly weaves together images from their Soviet childhoods as well as footage of them now as grown ups in post-communist Russia. My Perestrokia shows us just how duped these current Russian citizens felt about their childhood living in the Soviet Union.

The entire documentary has such a raw feeling that the viewer feels almost as if they are experiencing the effects of communism and post-communism themselves. The five former classmates attempt as best they can to compare their Soviet childhoods to their lives now as well as their supposed ""reality"" to what really occurred in actuality, but sometimes struggled to put their experiences into words.

""I can't say I wanted to be like everybody else - I simply was like everybody else,"" says Lyuba Meyerson, one of the five followed during this documentary. Lyuba, along with her husband, Borya, both teach high school social studies. In contrast to their professions, some of their former classmates took up occupations that were not even imaginable under the Soviet Union. Ruslan, a musician, speaks of all the music banned under communism. And then there is Andrei, who is an entrepreneur and owns his own chain of high-end stores, who would never have been able to own his own business before the collapse of communism.

The majority of them seem to feel better off without communism. However, Olga, who is a single mother, seems to be the most reminiscent of the past because in her opinion it was a less stressful time where everything was taken care of. ""I think it was less stressful for a person when he works and makes his 120 rubles a month,"" Olga remarked, stating her opinion that work and pay were more stable under communism. Athough Olga accepts that she was living in a false reality during the Soviet era, she for one seemed to prefer it that way. The others however seemed more pleased with their current lives and occupations.

My Perestroika is a must-see for anyone who has ever wondered what it was truly like to live under communism in the Soviet Union.",1351641600,,2303,4.852417302798982
4599665,4,B0058KIEMI,"My Perestroika, directed by Robin Hessman, tells the compelling stories of five people who attended School #57 in the Soviet Union. This film looks at the lives of these five former classmates from their childhood to present-day Russia through the use of interviews, anecdotes, political films, and even home videos. Olga is an independent single mother, who works for a billiard table servicing company. Lubya and Borya are history teachers at School #57, where there son attends school as well. Andrei is a businessman who started his own men's clothing company. Ruslan is a single father who lives a humble life as a musician. Although all are in very different places in their lives now, they all have similar stories of a childhood full of conformity, patriotism, and--as many Americans would be surprised to hear--complete joy and happiness. Each of these people expressed nostalgia towards the lives where they were stress free and held no worries. ""We had such wonderful times. After school, we always played outside together. We felt like we didn't have a care in the world,"" said Olga. But Perestroika was a very devastating time in the lives of these citizens of the Soviet Union, in that it showed the people that everything they had been taught was not reality. Borya recalled that, by eighth or ninth grade, he and his fellow classmates noticed that ""you saw with your own eyes that they say one thing and do something totally different."" This film helps one understand how these people have come to this realization and how it has affected their lives to this day. Although I honestly was not expecting it to be very interesting, it captured my attention from beginning to end. It was a great foundation on which to build my knowledge of the Soviet Union and Communism!",1348012800,3,1784,4.891089108910891
4599666,4,B0058KIEMI,"My Perestroika, directed by Robin Hessman, examines the lives of five adults who grew up in Soviet Russia (1970s and 1980s) and attended school #57. Throughout the documentary, they recount their experiences from a naive childhood to a conforming young adulthood and later to open-eyed realists coming to grips with the fact that what they were told wasn't always the reality. Although each of the five characters started at the same primary school, they end up in very different places. There's Olga, the struggling single mom who fixes billiard tables. Then comes Borya and Lyuba, married history teachers who return to teach at school #57 with their son, Mark. Andrei is a successful businessman who worked his way to the top by selling a French brand of men's work attire, and Ruslan, the sensitive musician who enjoys his humble lifestyle. This finely crafted film takes the viewer through the lives of these five characters, sequencing from early childhood nostalgia in the early 80s to the present. This film provides an inside look at Soviet society over time and gives an interesting array of viewpoints as the story moves through the innocent ""beautiful soviet reality"" (as one character describes their childhood) to the harsh awakening that not every story has a happy ending. Although the director suggests that demanded obedience yielded conformity in Soviet society, it is not made clear whether that conformity was a result of the age in which they experienced it, or the real power the soviet state had over children and adult citizens alike. There was little comparison between Soviet life and American life during the same time period. This left slight confusion as to which parts of their daily lives were foreign to me due to my generation (as a current college student) and which differences were due to the communist background of the country. This additional background information was provided for me in class by my professor. This film is a great first introduction to soviet society and worked very well as a supplemental piece in a course on the history of Russia and Eurasia.",1347494400,,2104,5.014285714285714
4599667,5,B0058KIEMI,"The film ""My Perestroika,"" by Robin Hessman, documents the lives of five adults who attended Moscow's School #57 as children during the 1970s. Each person's life experiences are artistically represented through interviews, historical footage, period music, and home videos. This film is especially useful for those who are beginning to explore the complexities of the Soviet Union and communism; helping students pose questions like ""what is or was communism/socialism,"" and ""how do people remember it?""

  The film begins with a child addressing a mass rally by thanking the communist state for creating a world of ""happy childhood"" and fighting for ""peace."" In reality, this historical clip displays the complexities of the world in which these children viewed themselves. The movie then dives into personal interviews with the main characters that begin to display what life under communism was like.

  The characters included teachers Lyuba and Borya Myerson, former punk rock star Ruslan Stupin, billiard company employee Olga Durikova, and business owner Andrei Yevgrafov. Now adults, each perceived communism in unique ways but as they grew older they came to recognize their own misconceptions of Soviet reality. One of the characters, Lyuba, remembers hearing the Soviet national anthem on television then jumping out of her chair and saluting to it. Later in the film it is discussed that upon reaching middle school age some of the students began to realize that what was said and what was reality did not match up. Lastly, Hessman shows these former classmates trying to make sense of their present reality in a country uncertain of what the future should be.

  Overall, this production begins with a review of the past and ends with a puzzling present. Puzzling in that it shows the now adults struggling to comprehend an unstable present which seems dull compared to the chaos of the past. Overall, Hessman is able to chronicle the history of the Soviet Union while simultaneously conveying the mixed feelings of a generation, all without voicing her own opinion.",1347408000,,2079,5.2379518072289155
4599668,3,B0058KIEMI,"I'm a naturalized American who grew up in Russia. I'm delighted that this film is available to enjoy for Americans interested in Russia and the history of the Soviet Union. It's also could be interesting for Russians themselves. The film has flair and many insights and is definitely worth watching. I do have some qualms. Towards the end I felt the film was losing its message and was beginning to pander to the U.S. stereotypes of Russia: the church, the elections, nationalism, Putin, etc.

a] My first qualm is this: Ms. Robin Hessman -- obviously a very talented director -- doesn't challenge her Russians. She chose to be outside the film. She is an invisible presence -- only a camera. We only see and hear the Muscovites who appear to be rambling on and on and on. Ergo, when the characters say something silly or illogical there is no one to push back and ask probing questions.

b] I was struck by excessive self-pitying of my former compatriots. The position in a nutshell is this: ""When we were young we believed the official ideology. Alas, this ideology was dumb. Today we struggle with the lack of ideals."" For me, it's hard to take it seriously. The majority of Russians knew that the official ideology was a load of garbage, but we were willing to put up with it. This is because like so often in Russia the alternative is anarchy -- a kind of Hobbesian ""state of nature"". This is precisely what happened in Russia after 1991. Here are the keys to understanding of almost universal deep dislike of Gorbachev by the ordinary Russians: he unleashed the forces of chaos he couldn't control.

c] The U.S. and Russia. Some of the characters are willing to go gong-ho pro-American and even want to vote for Barack Obama instead of Putin (Borya), some -- quick to criticize America (Ruslan). The tension, the dilemma is presented as Russia vs. U.S.A. My experience was different: we thought more about Europe, the U.S. was far-away both physically and culturally. An exotic land.

d] She/they avoided one important aspect related to status of Moscow. There always has been a tension between Moscow and the provinces, between the Muscovites and the rest of the population. The rest of the country have always believed that the Muscovites have an easy life, and unfairly so: better educations, better goods, better transportation, and easier access to services. This jealousy and distrust of Moscow had pushed Boris Yeltsin's reform when he came from the provinces (the Urals) to become the Moscow's Communist Party Chief (effectively a Moscow mayor) in 1985. But the more he pushed, the more it helped the centrifugal forces. There is no mentioning of this in the film. We are led to believe that these are the ordinary Russians. They are not. Muscovites often look down their noses to the ordinary Russians [and vice-versa], an idea which is obscured in the film.

e] Some very good segments have been cut off to make film shorter. For example, ""Sex in the Soviet Union"", ""the Russian rock"". They should have been included, especially about the rock music. One cannot ""get"" the Soviet collective psyche without understanding the phenomenon of Russian rock. We all listened to these tapes it in the late 1980s. I firmly believe that BG, Kino, Alisa, Nautilus, Voskresenye, etc had found viable metaphors for the young people, the language which spoke to the generation. This correct metaphor was precisely what was missing; it replaced the ossified, wooden language of the party nomenclature. It expedited the collapse of the system, which was linguistically-challenged.

f] The film touches on the subject of nationalism, but only scratches the surface. It could have used more. I believe the film's idea is that the Soviet regime fostered unhealthy nationalism and anti-Semitism. The truth of the matter is the reverse: it rather suppressed it. The Russian nationalism has been missing till recently, except briefly during the Second World War. Of course, the Stalin regime was anti-Semitic, but generally speaking the later Soviet empire was constituted as an antithesis to ethnic nationalism. It wasn't inefficiency and inhumanity which doomed the Soviet regime: its collapse was caused more directly by ethnic nationalism in the periphery of the Soviet Union. The first were the Poles, and the second were the Lithuanians. Then, there was a domino effect.

Finally, it's a decent documentary film on a rare subject. I recommend it, even with the reservations above. Lastly, be aware that the richness and ambiguity of the Russian language, as well as sarcasm of the characters, often get lost in translation through the subtitles. I would go on and offer some examples, but I am beggining to sound like a character from the film.",1340496000,21,4743,4.951005025125628
4599669,5,B0058KIEMI,"My Perestroika takes a great look at the last generation to come up, during the tail end of the Soviet Union's claw like grip on nations, like Russia, and the rest. This takes a candid look at the surreal, delusional world the Soviet youth were immersed in -one where patriotism did not correlate with reality, children were made to speak in patriotic lingo, at all times, and conduct themselves as Real People. Citizens were stripped of all individuality to be brainwashed. This was was something that the subjects challenged, as did thousands like them. The subjects, here, are interviewed about their youths, their lives, now, and and those interviews are juxtaposed with excellent footage from their childhoods (black and white reels contrasting their lives of thirty years ago with their contemporary day-to-day experience). Subjects include two school teachers, a punk rocker, a clothing salesman and a billiard sales rep.

The interviews are honest, humorous, insightful and haunting. To compare our world in the United States (in the mid 1960s to 1980s) with USSR is completely like comparing watermelons to apples. The propaganda we were fed of the fear of Communism, USSR's intentions with our nation, and others, versus what they were taught to believe are stark contrasts. It truly is amazing what politics and spin doctors do to divide people in our world - before and now. What a great look at a culture many of us may not know much about.",1339200000,3,1453,5.0041322314049586

8461728,5,B0058KIEMI,"Disclaimer: I know (and admire)  Hessman, the American film maker.
This is a very engaging and revealing documentary about the human side of Russian's transition from its Soviet past to a market-based ""democracy with Russian characteristics."" Through the interwoven footage of home movies, the viewer gets a good sense of how life felt to ordinary Russians on both sides of the transition. Unlike Mikhalkov's ""Anna"", which traces just one girl and her family through this period, MP provides a more balanced view of a range of outlooks. Again, unlike Mikhalkov, who is rarely subtle in revealing himself, in this film Hessman allows the figures to present a wide range of commentary, with no sense that she has a particular axe to grind.
Highly recommended for any students of Russia, Russian or the Soviet Union, or just anyone curious about societies in transition. The fact that the presentation is not linear, either in time or in the sequencing of segments of its Russian protagonists, makes this a bit more challenging, but definitely more engaging than many documentaries.",1396915200,,1079,5.130681818181818
