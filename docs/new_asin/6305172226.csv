7884126,3,6305172226,"I would have given this collection 2 stars instead of 3, but for under $7 it was ok. This seems like it was from the 80s, the audio was poor, and it was a little boring at times. There is no underwater footage of the wreck, contrary to what other reviewer said.",1338854400,,261,4.038461538461538
7884127,2,6305172226,"This Titanic documentary has its good points and its bad points.  It begins rather badly, in my opinion.  For some reason, the makers of the show feel compelled to explain the entire history of shipbuilding, going all the way back to the first prehistoric man who figured out a log would float on the water; a significant amount of time is spent talking to shipbuilders, showing us how a traditional builder is still constructing wooden vessels and taking us into the test labs of the U.S. Navy.  Then, it's science lesson time as the scientific principle of buoyancy is explained to us (complete with silly cartoon animation of a naked Archimedes jumping out of his bathtub).  Finally, we actually get to hear about the Titanic.  After some talk about superstition and luck, we get a computer-animated tour of parts of the ship, after which the same computer animation recreates the ship hitting the iceberg and eventually going under.  You won't find any reference to personal stories of victims or survivors, just the facts of the collision and catastrophe; the issue of blame is addressed, and a number of Titanic scholars weigh in with their opinions on the subject.  Toward the very end, we finally get to see some video of the Titanic as it lies at the bottom of the ocean.  I can say that the sound quality here is much better than that of the first three DVDs in this Titanic: The Mystery & and the Legacy series; unfortunately, in this case the visual display is quite bad at times, featuring such bright light that you can hardly see what is being shown.  If you are a Titanic fan, you really won't learn anything you don't already know from this documentary, and you will have to sit through a truly frustrating first 15 minutes of interesting but rather immaterial information.  There are much better Titanic documentaries available than this one.",1049760000,8,1860,4.766355140186916
7884128,2,6305172226,"This movie was very informative, and it gave me a sense of factual knowledge because of the indepth interview with Eva Hart.  I was very interested in what she had to say because she was actually on the Titanic.  However, I had a difficult time understanding the host and several other spoke persons due to their accents.  It was a little confusing, so I will not show all of it to my sixth graders because I think they will have a difficult time understanding the main points of the film.",987811200,,489,4.411111111111111
7884129,1,6305172226,I found this 50 minute documentary to be the worst that I have ever seen.  There is actually a point on the DVD that there is an audio problem (no audio) for about 7 seconds.  At least 10 minutes of it focuses on a  shipbuilder that produces small boats today.  Do not recommend!,950400000,2,279,4.2075471698113205
