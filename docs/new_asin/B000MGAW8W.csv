2730289,1,B000MGAW8W,interesting other reviews...this product won't be released until 12/29/2015.  They must have read the book or previously saw the movie in the theatre.,1446768000,,150,5.521739130434782
2730290,3,B000MGAW8W,"Backpacking the Appalachian Trail without ever having backpacked before is like getting married without ever having dated. You will not know what to expect and you will not fully appreciate the opportunity because you have not had a shorter backpack outing to whet your appetite. But that is exactly what Bill Bryson and his friend Stephen Katz attempted in 1996, and A Walk in the Woods is the movie that results from the book that results from their efforts.

There are several incidents in the movie that are taken straight from the book and several incidents in the movie, such as the Cubs/Red Sox banter, that are not in the book. Four of the main differences are:

1. The movie could not capture all of Mr. Brysons accounts of the history, geology, biology and botany of the AT and the movies two backpackers. Other than Brysons bemoaning the demise of the chestnut tree, this science of the AT is largely ignored by the movie,
2. Bryson and Katz, are 30 years older in the movie than in the book (and, from my perspective, it is completely unrealistic that a character as overweight and as old as the Steven Katz character portrayed by Nick Nolte could hike over 800 miles of the AT),
3. The movie does not depict how much Bryson and Katz relied on the AT shelters. The movie makes it seem that they only slept in their tents except when they found a city with a hotel room, and
4. The movie makes it clear that Bryson is hiking the AT for personal reasons and writing a book is not a consideration; but, he could not have remembered the incidents that are in the book if he did not take some notes, intended for publication, as he travelled.

But, otherwise, the themes of the book; friendship, self-discovery, and the challenges of the AT; are fairly well depicted in the movie. The reason that I am disappointed in this movie is that Bryson and Katz have a chance to do what few other people have a chance to do; and, although they are glad that they accomplish what they do, they never seem to relish the experience. They commit backpacking no-nos such as leaving their defecation near the trail and lightening their loads by leaving excess baggage on the trail. And, for that, they are to be pitied. I wanted to be lifted up by a backpacking movie about two senior backpackers; but, because they do not understand or embrace the wilderness ethic and the joy of backpacking, the movie leaves me uninspired.",1446076800,17,2417,4.564516129032258
2730291,5,B000MGAW8W,"I find this one a lot better than the movie wild. In this one, the movie is more funny. Has a lot more action. More scenery. More realistic.  Has a good end foot note, ""Where to next?"". As if his retirement is just the beginning. See this one instead of wild because if your like me, and like to laugh rather than fall a sleep during a movie, then this is your top pick. Worth watching.",1445385600,64,386,4.078947368421052
2730292,5,B000MGAW8W,"Have you read any of the humorous travel books by Bill Bryson (""Notes From a Small Island"" and ""I'm a Stranger Here Myself"")? In this one, when he ""hikes the Appalachian Trail,"" he really DOES hike the Appalachian Trail (apologies to former South Carolina Governor Sanford). Yup. It's a ""Road Trip"" comedy where we watch an ill-matched duo try to cope with the hazards and inconveniences of being on the road together.

Director Ken Kwapis (""The Office"" and ""He's Just Not That Into You""), working with a screenplay based on Bryson's book, centers his movie on the ex-pat writer who has moved back home with his English family. This setup delivers a witty, satisfying, R-rated (language) dramedy for people of a certain age. For me, it generates a whole new respect for authentic actors who resist the siren song of plastic surgery; it's nice to see real people on screen.

We appreciate:
  * Robert Redford (""All is Lost"") Bill Bryson has returned to the U.S. after almost two decades in Europe. Watch his tongue-tied reaction to that rude talk-show host! Confronted by signs of aging (ailing friends, funerals, doctor visits), he longs for a new adventure, so he decides to hike the celebrated Appalachian Trail, which passes near his home town. He can't find any friends who share his enthusiasm.
  * Emma Thompson (""Saving Mr. Banks"") Catherine is adamantly opposed to her husband's idea. Her reasons include his age, some well-publicized bear attacks, potential injuries...the list goes on and on. Ultimately he goes, so she says, ""Try not to die!""
  * Nick Nolte (""Warrior"") Hard-drinking alcoholic Stephan Katz calls because he heard of Bill's plan through a mutual friend (Katz had NOT been invited). They had been close friends years ago, but had a serious falling out.
  * Kristen Schaal (Lots of TV and voice work) Non-stop gasbag Mary Ellen is an unwelcome intruder. She provides our hapless duo with their first common goal: Ditch her!
  * Mary Steenburgen (""Last Vegas"") Jeannie is the proprietor of a family-owned motel. Her lovely mother is a piece of work! I hope Bryson mailed Jeannie a check.
  * Susan McPhail (""Mississippi Grind"") Beulah teaches Katz to keep his hands off a stranger's panties! Actually, her husband does...

The dialogue seems authentic: two guys reminiscing about adolescence, pranks, girls, college and other shared youthful experiences. By the time they became adults,  Bryson had a career, a wife, a family and is happily domesticated. Katz is still an unrepentant hedonist, a drunk who has seen more breasts than Bryson ever dreamed of! Bill says, ""Books are television for smart people."" Katz is convinced the trail is ""uphill all the way to Maine.""

Once we see samples of the gorgeous terrain, we understand why so many people want to hike this trail, yet only 10% actually complete it. Expect a few F-bombs and some adult humor (Katz is amused that Bill buries his own waste just off the trail, ""In the WOODS?!?"").

Here in Seattle, residents of a nearby retirement community were treated to this advance screening. It was perfect for them and they had a great time! Everyone will.",1445126400,117,3129,4.938931297709924

2730299,1,B000MGAW8W,Nick Nolte was perfect as Steven Katz but I just could not see Redford as Bill Bryson. Just didn't work for me. If you read the book A Walk in the Woods you were probably as disappointed as I was at how badly the movie missed in portraying the various characters and situations. Really a poor job all around. The only enjoyable part of the movie was Nick Nolte's portrayal of Steven Katz.,1524096000,,388,4.328767123287672

2730322,5,B000MGAW8W,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but ended up really liking it. For one thing, it made me laugh out loud several times--something I rarely experience with a movie. As one reviewer said, Redford is great in his understated way against Nick Nolte. They both show their age, but that's what they're playing: old men who are needing something new in their lives/as well as needing to recapture something they had together in their youth. They do achieve it, through some hilarious and moving adventures on the Appalachian Trail (which the same reviewer said 'doesn't disappoint.')",1521590400,,584,5.030927835051546

It was great to see Robert Redford and Nick Nolte again.  I think anyone can get a great many laughs from this film but those of us over age 50 will most likely enjoy it the most.

For whatever reason, the filmmaker couldn't be bothered to even *try* to make it realistic; Bryson's and Katz's packs are obviously filled with paper, not real gear; they pack poles the whole way ... but never use them; they do some amazing flip-flopping, hiking Shenandoah National Park *before* they get to McAfee Knob a hundred or more miles to the south. Meanwhile, Nolte looks as if he could croak at any moment.

So, no, it's not a good movie.

2730447,5,B000MGAW8W,"I had a group of 6 friends over for a movie night. We all enjoyed this movie very much. Apart from the humour, there were moments of pathos as well as the wonderful scenery.  Brysons book is my very favourite non fiction book. It has been a hugely popular best seller. I think that explains a lot of the disappointment and criticism that the film version has attracted. Naturally, theres a lot more in the book and the film has a couple of inaccuracies.  Unfortunately this is true of many movies based on books. In the old days they even sometimes changed the endings.
Admittedly Redford and Nolte were too old for the roles. Bryson and his friend Katz were only in their mid 40s when they did the walk. However, as our viewing group are all over 60, the older ages of the two actors added another dimension to the movie that we could all relate to - the challenge of a last great adventure before senescence really starts to set in.
All in all a pleasant uplifting movie, which I could watch again.",1509667200,,1000,4.4

Well it may seem that to Bryson He had not done enough but to Katz looked at Life from the other end of the Mountain Bryson thought He was still at the bottom and Katz reminded Him he was at the top as you Heard Katz say to Him that You have everything a Man could want Bryson couldn't see it He had to walk that Trail and Bryson defiant to the end when they got in the Cart headed home said We didn't finish Katz had to tell Yes You did You walked it , The thing is He didn't have to walk the whole Trail to gain all he needed to prove mostly to me Bryson was blinded by looking at his Life in the Wrong way I have done similar thing right now as my Friend from when I was young reminded me all I have gone thru and have seen in this World ... So I can so relate to this movie when they got to the Cliff standing there looking out far as you can see I tried to picture myself right there because I told have been there where they were ...

I had read this book 15 years ago and really enjoyed it (it was my first Bill Bryson book).  Bryson and his friend Steve Katz were old friends from Iowa hiking parts of the trail in their 40s, not 70s like the two actors were.  How were they going to pull this off without taking away from the book?

It turns out, there's very little that carried over from the book.  The chatty woman, the many stays in hotels, and Katz's struggles with booze are all that carried over. Both actors are clearly past their physical prime.  I know people in their 70s and 80s who have hiked the Appalachian (AT)and John Muir Trail, so age alone is not the issue.  Katz in real life was still an alcoholic in the book and the men broke off the hike because of Katz' need for alcohol.  In fact, the second part of the book ""Walk in the Woods"" is very dark and angry because of the mens' arguing over Katz's alcoholism, even though both men are heavy drinkers.  Many of the stories in the book Bryson got from talking to thru-hikers while he drank his beer in nearby lodges along the trail.

Most of the film was made in state parks in northern Georgia, although the director did use drones and the actors show up in a few memorable landmarks along the AT.

The movie turns out to be two older men trying to make peace with themselves as they age.  Redford talks about the American chestnut's demise and other environmental issues, adding a preachiness that wasn't in the book.  There are some beautiful scenes and a few funny moments and the acting isn't bad.  But this movie is nothing like the book.",1507766400,,1669,4.376623376623376

It's also good to see older actors not playing people half their age and the humor was just right - subtle, gentle.  A little bit of unnecessary language but otherwise a good movie that made me a little nostalgic for those times when I used to say to a friend, we're going on a little adventure.",1507680000,,622,4.282051282051282

Their movements on screen betray the illusion.  That being said, the real issue is the movie is just not funny.  I did laugh a couple of times, but only with Nick Nolte.  Redford is mostly just present in the movie, no real acting there.  Nolte at least is funny, but his speech is strained, making his acting a strain.  If you watch Nolte when he was young he always had that strain which added character, but it's now exaggerated with age and just exhausting.  I'm writing this as the movie is playing and not completely done, but I've considered shutting it off a few times already.  Given the time I've invested in this, like the characters, It's now an endurance challenge to try to finish it.  I will say the movie improves a bit as it progresses, maybe that's just me connecting with them out of sheer boredom, but the improvement is not enough to redeem itself.

2730469,5,B000MGAW8W,"Review of A Walk in the Woods
Hot Toasty Rag, September 26, 2017

Retired travel writer Robert Redford is bored. He has a beautiful house, a loving wife, Emma Thompson, and semi-affectionate grandchildren, but hes bored. His idea? Getting together with a buddy and hiking the Appalachian trail, or as he phrases it when he calls all his friends, going for a walk in the woods. Hence the title.

The only snag in his plan? None of his friends want to join himexcept Nick Nolte, whom he hasn't seen in decades. They don't see eye to eye on much, but they're stuck together during this hilarious and sweet movie about finding happiness. When you're not laughing yourself silly from every line Nick Nolte delivers, youll be able to appreciate the beautiful nature that surrounds them, and its always great to see Robert Redford in a setting he loves so passionately. He gives a little speech about how important it is to appreciate and protect nature, and the movie wouldnt feel complete without it.

I absolutely love this movie, and I cant think of anyone I wouldnt recommend it to. There isn't anyone in the world who hates Robert Redford, and theres nothing offensive in the script. Its funny, clever, thoughtful, touching, and wise.",1506384000,,1233,4.779342723004695

Completely embarrassing. Awful acting, terrible direction and writing, sentimental, corny, took forever to get going, tried to be funny and wasn't, and (I never thought I would say it) but Robert Redford looked so old, sun-baked, and ruined -- and not in an interesting way that I could scarcely look at him. The director is a nobody and my guess is that Redford and Nolte ran all over him. I hardly ever write reviews, but I just had to warn potential viewers.

It's totally not realistic the way they portrayed the hike.

As one reviewer said - who ever picked Robert Redford for this supposed comedy role should go back to the drawing board. Redford has many great movies where he was meant to be, but this one surely tarnished his crown.  Again HW wins with stupid.

Bill Bryson's 1998-published book shares his story of hiking the Appalachian Trail (AT) with his buddy Stephen Katz in the 1990's while in his 40's.  Both men are in over their heads and their opposite personalities make for some entertaining comic effect.  Bryson is a travel writer and an intelligent man... Katz is crude, obnoxious, overweight, and a former alcoholic to boot.  The AT spans about 2,100 miles between the states of Georgia and Maine on varied terrain and weather conditions. Not to mention bears!  These guys plan to go all the way, but ultimately realize the enormity of their venture and their limitations as mortal (middle-aged) men.  Even so, it's more about the journey than the destination and Bryson keeps us fully engaged with his witty humor and vast knowledge and history of the trail and all the nature, animals, people, etc within... and more.  The book is both entertaining and educational.

The movie is not entirely true to the book.  And it didn't have to be... but I thought it could have been way better.  I mean, it was better than I thought it would be and I still enjoyed it. Initially, I took one look at the casting and low reviews and thought it would be terrible.  These actors look twice the age of the men in the book (amazing that RR is like 80 yrs old and still has 23 yr old blond hair that doesn't match his melting face).  I soon realized that Nick Nolte is actually a perfect rendition of Katz and the very best thing about this movie.  And while I love Robert Redford for bringing a book I love to the screen.... he's just too wooden for me to appreciate-- second only to Keanu Reeves who has more wood in his acting than the entire AT.

Worst of all, we don't get to meet that side of Bryson in the movie that we meet in the book... the man who is filled to the brim with witty commentary and random facts and history of all things orbiting this odyssey.  These are things he shared with the reader directly as he narrated... I thought they should have had him sharing at least some of those things with Katz in the movie in order to keep the integrity of his character.  Instead, all we meet are a couple of fragile elderly men who mostly come off as pathetic and naive and destined to fail.  Occasionally it was charming and funny but mostly I just preferred the book characters.

It does say a lot about aging and taking on dreams that are bigger than our limits.  That aspect of the story was endearing. I guess I still recommend it.  It's still fun to watch the book come alive, even if it's not as good.  And a final interesting fact.  Robert Redford actually took on this movie with the plan to make it a reunion buddy movie with Paul Newman.  RIP Paul Newman... and NOPE.

I gave it 4 stars because that means I liked it, not the I ""loved it"" of 5 stars.  It's one of those sit back and enjoy what unfolds movies.  Funny, thoughtful, good acting and good writing.  Some actors I could watch and like in just about anything.  This movie has four of them, Emma Thompson, Mary Steenburgen, Robert Redford and Nick Nolte.  That line up really kind of says it all.

Redford's character portrayal comes off a bit fake now and then, tho at other moments his genuine side kicks in and it's good. Redford has rarely been good at acting emotions somewhat unnatural to his personality vs reciting those mostly heartfelt.
Nolte does a good job, but genuinely looks too old and shaky for the hike, and I kept thinking they wanted him to look the part of someone having died on the trail just around the next bend (that's not necessarily a spoiler).
The scenery is beautiful.
It's still better than a bunch of Transformers fighting at Db level 150 in a mass of digital effects bs you've seen a hundred times over, but rent it.

2730657,5,B000MGAW8W,"Released in 2015, A Walk in the Woods stars Robert Redford as an over-the-hill writer who decides to hike the 2,200-mile Appalachian Trail. After his wife (Emma Thompson) insists he get a partner, the only one whos up for it is an old overweight friend with a drinking problem (Nick Nolte). Kristen Schaal and Mary Steenburgen have peripheral roles, amongst others.

I rate movies according to what they are and aspire to achieve. This is a consistently amusing drama/adventure starring two seasoned veterans and it thoroughly delivers the goods as quality entertainment spiced with worthy mindfood. Some people complain that Redford and Nolte were too old for the parts (they were 78 and 73 during filming) in light of the real Bill Bryson and Katz being in their 40s in the satirical 1998 biography, but without them the movie wouldnt have been made and, besides, they're eminently effective in the roles and drive home the point of out-of-shape, mature wannabe hikers.

Its vastly superior to Emilio Estevez similar The Way (2010).

The movie runs 104 minutes and was shot along the Appalachian Trail in North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, as well as Sharon, Connecticut. It was directed by Ken Kwapis from a script by Michael Arndt & Bill Holderman from Bill Brysons book.

A well off writer wanting a new experience ( Redford ), and old friend that has squandered his life away, drinking and chasing women ( Nolte ). Both men looking to reconnect with their desire to have an adventure. They don't consider that they, leading sedentary lives, are ill equipped to handle a long arduous hike. Neither has the outdoor knowledge or the physical fitness to undertake such and adventure. But they start out with determination to fulfill their goal. As in real life, they encounter obnoxious people, those willing to be truly helpful, and yes, bears. As the story progresses, they reflect on their past and see the beauty around them. They come to realize that they are not able to complete their journey. But they accomplished what they were after, having a new adventure. Watching these veteran actors is quite enjoyable, it shows how being older only makes more opportunity for people with talent. You watch Nick Nolte in U Turn, or Teachers, and then you watch this one and you think, this guy is good. Then you watch this and although he is obviously aging, he's still got it. You ask why four stars?, it is because it ended too soon.  :(",1487980800,,1210,4.68075117370892

Enjoyed the rapport between the big hammy Nick Nolte and still making hearts melt Robert Redford. Felt the friendship seemed pretty honest. Redford played what i would think Bill Bryson would be as a person having read pretty much all his travelogue books.

The DVD extras knock this down a star as I felt they were slapdash and way too short. The outtakes were not all that funny really.

Like the two old guys on a end-game buddy hike, it was kind of tired.

2730766,5,B000MGAW8W,"I have never read the book, so this review is based solely on the movie itself and not a comparison of the two. When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I could not wait to watch it in theaters. I happen to like humorous, feel-good movies with older people in them (one of my favorites is ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"") so I knew this movie would not disappoint me. Is it Oscar-worthy or Redford's/Nolte's best work? Of course not! But it IS lighthearted and funny, and that is a refreshing change to some of the movies being produced these days. Centered around rekindled friendship, the desire to do more with one's life, and the thrill of a long hiking adventure, it's a wonderful movie to watch on a rainy day or to pass time. You are essentially getting a movie-eye view of two old-time friends attempting to do something almost entirely ridiculous and out of nowhere for their age, and the troubles and trials that hilariously plague their journey. Of course, as with every feel-good movie, there is some sort of lesson learned or life changing realization in the end, which will make you question and reflect on your own life when it's all said and done. Are you actually living, or just existing? Are you really doing anything worthwhile? Is this where you want to be in 5, 10, 15 years from now? Well, Redford takes a hike to find out! If you feel like you're in a rut in life, and need a little get-out-there-and-live-a-little motivation, watch this movie. If hiking the AT is on your bucket list (it's on mine!), watch this movie. If you are a Redford fan (like I am) or enjoy the presence of Emma Thompson in anything (like I do), watch this movie. It will not please everyone, as nothing ever does, but I am not easily turned off by a movie unless there is copious amounts of gore or it is extremely boring (like ""Where the Wild Things Are"" was), so I can promise you that there is no possible reason to hate this movie. For some, it may be a film you only watch once. The friend I dragged with me to the theater walked out at the end and said it should have been called ""Two Old Men in the Woods"" (she'll never watch it again)...but I grabbed up the DVD when it first came out as quickly as I could and have watched it many times! Yes, it technically is about two old men the woods, but really, the whole thing was a joy from start to end. A hit, not a miss, in my opinion!",1485561600,,2394,4.322222222222222

2730769,3,B000MGAW8W,"""A Walk in the Woods"" was one of my all-time favorite books and I was going to see this movie no matter how good or bad the reviews were.  The movie was beautifully shot and provided some gorgeous views from the AT, but overall was disappointing.  They added stupid stuff to the screenplay for dramatic effect (Bryson & Katz actually DID skip a whole section of the AT) and left out other things.  For instance, in real life, the snowstorm they got stuck in was very harrowing.  They became completely disoriented and were knocked way off course, taking quite a while to get back on the trail.  As for the acting, Redford & Nolte were okay but not very believable.  Nolte also could've used subtitles as he was hard to understand.",1485129600,,730,4.534351145038168

2730813,1,B000MGAW8W,This movie is horrible and for some reason everyone likes this book and I think that the book is awful you may ask well why did you watch the movie and my response to that is I got 60 pages shy of finishing it and could not torture myself any longer and was reluctant to see how it ended. He in all actuality does rent the car and skip most of the trail intact I think he skipped more than he ever walked in the book his walk in the woods seemed more like a slumber in the backyard smores and all,1484697600,,496,3.872549019607843
2730814,3,B000MGAW8W,"""It's all right"" is about the nicest thing I can say about this film.  It plays fast and loose with Bill Bryson's biographical details (the book was written in 1995 when Bryson was 46, his wife is named Cynthia, he hadn't been chancellor of Durham University yet, etc.); the real Bill Bryson more resembles Nick Nolte's Katz than whatever piece of wood Robert Redford is impersonating.  Really--uninspired acting aside, a 78-year-old man playing a 64-year-old who is supposed to be 46?  Mostly the film falls flat for not having the real Bill Bryson's authorial voice that makes his books great reading.  Nick Nolte is fairly convincing as Katz, and the scene where he discusses his drinking is inspired.  Kristen Schaal injected much-needed humor (Bill Bryson is nothing if not funny) but unfortunately only briefly towards the beginning of the film.  Emma Thompson was underused but played her part well, and Mary Steenburgen and Nick Offermann can likewise be said to have done their duty.  Bottom line: Unless you're a Bryson nerd on a mission to consume every last bit of Bryson-related media, this movie is better skipped.",1484611200,,1128,5.0

There is a bit of language so if you have small children you might want to watch it ahead of time and make your own call.

If you have read the book you will notice some of the major changes to the main characters and overall story, but you get a similar outcome in the end.

Check it out and go for a hike once in a while.",1484611200,,492,3.8137254901960786
2730817,4,B000MGAW8W,"It seems if one has NOT read the book before seeing ""A Walk in the Woods"" the odds of enjoying it are MUCH greater. In this feel-good buddy movie Redford's ""Bill Bryson"" and Nolte's ""Stephen Katz"" both play well in their geezer roles. Bryson (an author of some note) and Katz (a long but nair do well friend of long absence) decide to hike the Appalachian Trail. This begins and a shared journey of calamity, humor and mutual self-discovery.

I think the movie is a fun romp and a easy watch (if you have not read the book). All indications are it departs in the book in a large number of ways including casting the main characters about 40 years older... As the book is excellent, see the movie first, then read the book. You'll enjoy both and the book will present a expanded, detailed, rich and interestingly different version of the story.

Because I saw ""A Walk in the Woods"" BEFORE reading the book and enjoyed this light buddy movie I'm giving it 4 stars. I liked it but it could have been better.",1484611200,,1004,4.421621621621622

2730828,5,B000MGAW8W,"I rented this movie by chance when it was a single copy lost on the wall of new releases at my local video rental store. I fell in love with it instantly.

While one can argue over the ""authenticity,"" of the trail and hiking in general, for me it spoke to my inner need to find more in this life.

Bryson, played by Robert Redford, is in a slump in his career.  A sort of middle age crises drives him to push himself one last time and he chooses the Appalachian Trail as his quest.  Being older, his wife agrees to allow him to undergo the challenge if he can find someone to go with him.  Enter Nick Nolte.

As old friends, who parted bitterly, They reunite on the trail while each facing their own life issues.  Their adventure is sprinkled with some off-the-cuff comedy that provides some good laughs as well as some heartfelt moments. In the end each is faced with what really matters in life.

As someone who put himself through many challenges while younger only to settle into a comfortable life this movie spoke to me on a deep level.  I often feel the need to challenge myself now, to prove I still have what it takes.  This movie has me looking for hiking boots!

2731440,2,B000MGAW8W,"I was looking forward to this movie.  It has a stellar cast and is based on what I've read is an interesting book.  So what went wrong?  For me it started with the simple unbelievability of Nick Nolte in the role.  No one in the shape Nolte has fallen into would give serious thought to trying to make it from the far side of the parking lot into the liquor store and back, let alone taking on the 2,100 mile Appalachian Trail.  The poor guy's face is so swollen and beet red in real life he looks like he could keel over at any minute.  There was simply no chemistry between Nolte and Redford, and while there were a couple of LOL moments in the movie, they weren't enough to rescue the film - for me anyway.  Too many of what were supposed to be funny scenes came across as too contrived to be funny.  There was was some gorgeous mountain scenery that was beautifully filmed - the blu-ray is stunning in parts - and it was cool unexpectedly seeing a scene filmed in Louise's Restaurant in Kennesaw, Ga (where I've eaten many times), and it isn't like watching the movie was a completely miserable experience.  It was a mildly entertaining movie.  I would have expected more from this cast, though.  Average fare at best.",1480982400,,1222,4.386666666666667

Halfway through the movie, I stopped it,  finished my workout  and decided to continue the video the next day.  Unfortunately the last half of the movie  was still less interesting than watching the clock minute hand.  Fortunately, it was a free download, and although I have watched some amazing and phenomenal movies on Amazon Prime -  in this case,  I got what I paid for.  Don't waste your download capacity, Shame on Robert Redford.",1478908800,,738,4.4
2731592,1,B000MGAW8W,"Does Hollywood have some kind of evil contract clause that forces Academy Award caliber actors to do a really bad movie when they get old to pay back Hollywood for all the crazy and wild toys, parties, acclaim and prestige they enjoyed while they were young? These old big time actor movies are painful. You want to root for the old guys but apparently nobody can write a script for old actors so they jump at any receipt that comes their way? Redford won Academy Awards for a Lifetime Achievement and Best Director for Ordinary People plus 2 nominations for The Quiz Show plus 2 nominations from BAFTA and 7 Golden Globe nominations. Nick Nolte was nominated 3 times for Academy Awards for Price of Tides, Affliction and Warrior and 4 Golden Globes with a win for The Prince of Tide plus numerous more. How do these two guys get shackled to suck a dumb movie, it's actually painful to watch. I believe they both have an Academy Ward film left in them and I wish they'd get it out. I don't think they should work together but I think they can get a set like Mel Gibson, Harrison Ford, Sly Stallone  or Jack Nicholson; As Good As It Gets is a solid comedy with a great cast, solid writing and good production value. I'll bet that either Nolte or Redford would take a swing at you if you told them what a crummy film A Walk in the Woods is.

2731900,3,B000MGAW8W,"I'm not familiar with the source material, so that may have an influence on my rating of the movie.  It's a bit slow, but that's fine for me (but I imagine a lot of people would dislike it for that reason.)  I would actually give it 5 stars, but I just can't do it.  It's one thing if it were a one-time isolated incident in the movie, but it was consistent throughout.  I'm not even the sort of person to even realize (or really even care about) such things in movies and whatnot, but it was so damned blatantly obvious that it just ruined the film for me.  Most of the time it is used as a means to describe the inhumanity/ugliness of a character, but that was never the case in the movie as it was largely glorified.  Bill Bryson (Robert Redford's character) kept having an extreme bias against fat people, particularly women.  It killed his character for me, and I tried to look past it, but this was something that bugged me the entire movie, which led to my lack of enjoyment of it.  As if people don't get enough cruel and snide remarks by the rest of the world already, it's also in movies and is the one form of bullying that is still perfectly acceptable to society apparently.  The general treatment of women in the entire movie is actually something that didn't sit well with me.  Stephen Katz (Nick Nolte's character) wanted to screw every big woman he saw.  Jeannie (Mary Steenburgen's character) was basically forgotten about and almost nothing but affair fodder.  Catherine Bryson (Emma Thompson's character and wife of main character Bill Bryson) was essentially told that her opinion on the entire thing didn't matter.  While in the end she ended up supporting Bill (mostly so that he'd come home safe,) it foreshadowed the role women were going to have the entire film.  The insufferable know-it-all ""you're doing it wrong"" type of person that you would find in those sorts of situations was... again, a woman.  The 2 ""helpful"" guys were ""hated"" (yet undoubtedly kind and helpful) and after their key scene where they helped Bill and Stephen,they were loved.  Yet again though, 2 males.  I admire Robert Redford for his activism, particularly with his activism with wolves, and I'm really hoping that the majority of such comments were taken right from the source material and only part of the script and not impromptu.",1477612800,,2338,4.663414634146341

2731902,2,B000MGAW8W,"This was a tired buddy movie.  Robert Redford seemed to just paint the numbers, though he did have the best line in the movie - a reference to reading being ""TV for smart people"" - that was a funny line.  Nick Nolte was actually a pleasant surprise.  He really committed to this role as the aged near do well and his performance was entertaining to watch.  Emma Thompson's gave it her all, but it felt like...too much.  Our introduction to her character is of a matriarchal housewife ""with a stiff upper lip"" as the Brtits are want to say, and the closing has her as an emotional wreck amazed that her dottering husband was capable of returning to her after his adventure with all of his bits and pieces all filling the same space.  The dichotomy seemed out of character and pulled me out of the movie.  Which I wasn't really all too vested in to begin with.",1477612800,,858,4.3924050632911396

2731981,5,B000MGAW8W,Hilarious!  Maybe because we are 60+ this really was an excellent movie.  Pairing Nolte & Redford was genious.  I think it was a movie the older audience can relate to.  Laughed til we cried!,1477526400,,191,4.529411764705882

2732015,4,B000MGAW8W,"This was a very sweet buddy movie for the over 50 crowd. It was fairly faithful to the book.  It is hard to capture Bryson's inimitable voice.  He is the quintessential tourist--irritated and awestruck, often at the same time.  Bryson's unique persona does not really come through. The movie focuses on his love for his family, particularly his wife, his love of the outdoors and his need to do something to wake his slumbering self out of late middle age and less on the trenchant and humorous observations that make his books so unique.  Katz, played by Nick Nolte, fares much better, except that he is more conventionally heroic, as a recovering alcoholic, in the movie than in the book. The pleasure of Bryson's travelogues is less in what he does, because he often doesn't do very much, and more about his observations of the people around him.  He says and thinks what we all say and think, but rarely aloud.  I can't help but wonder if this movie would have fared better with the omniscient narration of the main character, much like Shepard Smith provided in A Christmas Story.  Redford's character does more observing than talking, while Bryson's books are a non-stop, generally very funny, stream of consciousness rant.  But the scenery was beautiful, and the story of two childhood friends reconnecting for one last buddy adventure was very sweet.  In the movie, as in the book, you sense this is a last ditch attempt by Katz to break out of  his increasingly narrow path, which appears to be headed toward a bedroll under an overpass,cadging dollars from motorists. In both narratives, the desperation of this overweight, out of shape man to change the direction of his life with the help of his spectacularly successful friend comes through.  And in both the book and the movie, the ending is hopeful.  If you read the book, watch the movie.  If you watch the movie, read the book.  Each is a pleasure, but a different pleasure.",1477440000,,1941,4.755223880597015

All the previous one-star reviews were spot-on; as a matter of fact, I got way more enjoyment reading those reviews than I did watching the movie.  Laugh-out-loud funny reviews.

2732079,2,B000MGAW8W,"Disappointing.  Could have been so much better.  Had a few funny moments, but dialogue was a mix of cliches and other locker room moments.  Redford is characteristically wooden.  He has a history with his sidekick but its underdeveloped.  Nolte is a little more believable, but little depth to get past the more obnoxious aspects of his character.  Not that people aren't often boorish and boring, but there's a reason that this character type doesn't elicit compassion or even much curiosity.  So, two quite unlikely protagonists and, sadly, a somewhat shallow, mediocre river running throughout.",1477267200,,597,5.287234042553192

Perfect acting but necessarily slow on spots.  Take the Haley Mills PARENT TRAP and try to use a couple of questionable guys instead of Haley Mills and Haley Mills.  It's NOT Disney, but has its moments.  Adult comedy not for kids.",1477267200,,406,4.647887323943662

2732515,4,B000MGAW8W,Good movie with a couple of old geezer actors. It is good to see this kind of movie can still be made.  Nick Nolte was a little bit tiresome as he has never achieved the skill of Redford.  Emma Thompson was delightful as usual in a supporting role. By the time it was over I was ready to walk the Appalachian Trail myself.,1477094400,,322,4.095238095238095

2732657,3,B000MGAW8W,"I expected more from a Robert Redford film, but like the character he portrays, he is past his prime. A Walk in the Woods is the tale of a writer looking for his next great adventure, but recognizing that he may have seen his final adventure already. Once he commits to walking the Appalachian Trail, he seeks a traveling companion. The only one who will join him is a longtime acquaintance with whom he essentially broke off contact over 10 years previously - for reasons never fully made clear. Nick Nolte is at his finest in the character of Stephen Katz  - he's that old friend you used to have but was never that good or that close and you'd rather not acknowledge. Katz is not a bad guy; he just lives life by improvisation, and that drives Bill Bryson (Redford) nuts. As they set off on their joint venture along the trail, the story becomes one of two old men who should have stayed home. It's never clear if the film is a comedy or an attempt at serious drama, but it comes off somewhere in between - rather unsuccessfully. There are bright spots throughout the film, mostly centered around the misadventures of Katz and Bryson's drive to complete the trail.

A Walk in the Woods is a good film, with entertainment value and a decent story. It's just not as good as other things Redford has done.",1477008000,5,1305,4.456066945606694
2732678,4,B000MGAW8W,Wife and I enjoyed the movie although we did not realize they would take so many side trips back to civilization and away from the trail.,1476921600,,137,4.3076923076923075
2732679,2,B000MGAW8W,"Having read Bill Bryson's wonderful book, I found I just couldn't watch this movie. Robert Redford was so very miscast it was embarrassing. I stopped it about 10 minutes in.",1476921600,,173,4.8
2732680,1,B000MGAW8W,"I think Robert Redford is a wonderful actor and director.  This being said.....A Walk in the Woods was so slow, and uninteresting I turned it off after watching for 30 minutes.",1476921600,,176,4.67741935483871
2732681,4,B000MGAW8W,This was a good movie but could have been a little funnier. It seemed forced at times.,1476921600,,86,4.117647058823529
2732682,4,B000MGAW8W,"Beautiful scenes, some practical experiences, but a lot of the language wouldn't happen in front of the kids in the movie.  Neither would have made it as far as they did in real life.  But it's a movie very enjoyable to watch.",1476921600,,226,4.357142857142857

It almost felt as if I was taking this trip with 1 of my long-time  friends. An occasional chuckle and at times you root for them and when a movie moves you to that level of participation, well, then it must be pretty good. Bitter sweet is that the trip was not finished yet the ending was well satisfying. However, in this sequel driven cinema world, maybe the trip will continue.

The music that was used was really nice and represented that part of the country well.  I live near the trail and wish everyone could experience at least a short hike in this wilderness.  The actors quickly found out how difficult many parts of the trail are and why many have high hopes starting out but quickly face the reality of the difficulties ahead. The interaction between the characters was good and the characters they met on the trail were spot on.  Harpers Ferry, WV is right on the trail and many of the people who hike stop off there to rest and get supplies.  I was there on the 4th of July and would swear I met some of these same interesting  people who the actors met while on their hike.",1476576000,,875,4.4375
