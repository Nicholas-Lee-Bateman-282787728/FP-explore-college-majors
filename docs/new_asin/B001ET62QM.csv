8299493,4,B001ET62QM,The content in this DVD is pretty good. I had been practicing some of these drill prior and can say that as I watched the video I was able to understand the switches between drills and the mixture from one drill to the next was very good. The professor takes his time in showing the moves fro the switches and seem a little more clear than others I've seen. The sound recording was not good in parts of the video and that was a set back since you need to pay close attention to not only the moves but the verbal instructions. In spite of this I recommend this DVD for those interested in benefiting from the drills.,1403568000,,615,4.220338983050848

As a self defense trainer I appreciated the variety of drills, and the pratical applications taught.  The instructor is laid back but detailed and you can see that they are having fun.  The skill is one often taught but this dvd offers some unique twists and interpretations not seen on other dvd's  Also the Price is right!  A well done dvd to include in your library for under 30 bucks.  Cant beat that!",1237852800,,519,4.410526315789474
8299495,4,B001ET62QM,"First I must say that the dvd provided the information that was promised.

It is an introduction of hand drills of the instructor's style, which are hand drills.  The drills are not new but I don't believe it was stated within the description that they were.

I found the drills & the presentation of the drills to be informative, which is the purpose of a ""instructional"" dvd.  In this respect whether we are already familiar with the drills presented or not, as long as the information educates us about the technique, the instructor has done the what was promised.

Regarding the production efforts & techniques: it is ridiculous to expect that the 1st production & presentation is going to be as polished as Guro Inosanto's last dvd.  Matter of fact I've been a student of the FMA since 1985, I've seen the 1st productions that Guro Dan, Cass Magda, Paul Vunak & others released early in their careers;  their productions while they were informative/instructional also needed to be polished.

For that matter I believe a previous review mentioned Steve Grody dvd production;  I owned dvds by Guro Steve Grody & gave them away because it was material that had been done & over done by other instructors.  While this does not take anything away from Guro Grody's skill, it really doesn't speak to the creativity of his production either.

Any perspective buyers/students should keep one simple fact in mind;  this is an ""instructional"" dvd of FMA hand to hand drills.  This is not a dvd on movie/video production, set design &/or script writing.  If someone wants instruction on movie/video production, I would recommend shopping for that material rather than in FMA martial arts dvds.",1237507200,,1687,4.894366197183099
8299496,2,B001ET62QM,"This product really has me torn.  On the one hand, I realize that people have 'aha' moments when their art fits together in their mind and it is nice that someone puts those thoughts on video to benefit others.  On the other hand, the advertising feels like a bit misleading.

The ad I saw for this only said Malay martial arts, and had a quote from Bob Orlando.  I thought to myself 'I should get this, even sight unseen, because there's not a lot out there about Malay martial arts'.  After viewing this video, there still isn't.

What he covers is basic hubud-lubud from Filipino arts.  There is little here that one can't find elsewhere and, I'm sorry to say, the little that one might consider 'new' is an easy extrapolation.  I would have been happy even with a unique application of the basic drills.

At one point he says ""I don't think anyone else has ever put this on video"" and I think, 'I have: Dan Inosanto, Paul Vunak, and Steve Grody, among others'.

He does this bit about the exercise not being called hubud-lubud, and that it's just a name.  Whatever the veracity of this argument, he's still showing the same stuff.

He also does some things that I think are wrong, but to each his own.  I would have found a discussion of stylistic differences interesting, but there were no explanations as to why they do things the way they do to even come to your own conclusions.

The production value is middling.  At times, there's a child and someone else in the background.  He does perform in front of a white area.  A better production would have the performers fill the frame more.  All that being said, while these things are noticeable, you can still hear and see the performers.

I suppose this video has some value for beginners.  But truthfully, I find Steve Grody's videos are better.",1223683200,3,1804,4.543478260869565
