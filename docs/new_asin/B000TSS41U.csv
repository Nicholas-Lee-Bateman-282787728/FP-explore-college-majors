The story is unconnected and is a lot lighter than the heavy drama of Once Were Warriors and its successor. I often wonder why this movie has been largely overlooked. It's a great adventure movie with wonderful shots of the natural world of New Zealand. Drama, suspense, romance and an engaging and interesting story. This movie has it all.

A Maori (Temuera Morrison) returns to his tribe after the death of his father. He encounters his daughter and his brother, who leads a Maori commune in the hills. The question is: who is going to succeed their father as tribal chieftain? Kahu, the brother with the back-to-nature camp, seems to be the first choice. But not everything is as it seems. Sit back, relax, enjoy and find out!

I recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in Native Peoples and land rights. And if you enjoyed Once Were Warriors, you can't go far astray with this movie.",1197158400,3,971,4.6395348837209305
