8585352,5,B00CRO6OIE,"I loved making this DVD series.  I took the first batch of 2,400 Fractal VJ Loops to make these discs.  Later my collection would grow to 16,800 VJ Loops with resolutions ranging from 1024x768 up to what now would be called ""20K"".  These are ideal for conversational pieces at art shows, lounges, parties, in waiting areas, schools, night clubs, as background visuals, etc.  These are also ideal for use with developmental or cognitive impairments.  A terrific way to get their imaginations and pattern recognition skills engaged.  Add an optional pair of ChromaDepth 3D glasses and you can enjoy the illusion of depth as the warm colors seemingly float off the video screen, the neutral color sits in the middle ground, while the cool colors appear to sink into the monitor or TV set.  ChromaDepth 3D glasses are purchased through American Paper Optics who also manufacture them.  One trick worth mentioning is to increase the viewing distance so as to maximize the illusion.  You may be tempted to touch, scoop, poke, or otherwise manipulate the various layers as they jut out at you or retract from you.

Please only buy these from my Amazon links.  They make the discs on demand.  You'll get the best price too.",1488758400,,1215,4.844660194174757
