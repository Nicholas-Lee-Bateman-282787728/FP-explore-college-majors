7871429,3,6304458606,This is an ok set at best. The DS9 episdo and TOS are only real battle ones. Why they did NOT use best of both world for TNG I do not know. If you are trying to collect all them like me this helps.,994118400,,197,3.5
7871430,5,6304458606,"Well to be honest I have only seen The Way of The Warrior (DS9), but to my amazement I found it for 14.99 at a local store. I did not bother to check if there had been a price error...duh? So I jetstreamed to the checkout and glanced over the tapes inside! Balance of Terror from the TOS series its got Captain Kirk, the greatest Vulcan ever Spock and fiesty old Bones...Who cares its going to be great,not to mention its one of only two episodes in the TOS series with Romulans.. Romulan Ale anyone?  Havent seen TNS Gambit but again I love Trek , and you really can't lose with Capt. Picard and crew... then on to DS9 The Way of The Warrior, look I love this one! I already had it but im like hey this episode is so frilling good I must have two copies or even three! + Worf is great. Any Trek with Worf as the main character is awesome.. and then on to Voyager Maneuvers..havent seen this one but I have read really awesome reviews about it.. So I guess at this point your like how can this Q be a trek junky and not have all these, well I have them now. The box itself is a bit of a let down...Whats with the Klingon blood wine red color?  The lid just pops off the top and there sits the videos on the outside of a cheap but sorta cool looking center piece, not to cool compared to box sets in general. Like the cool looking Borg box set that looks like a Borg Cube or the Q Continuum set that is odd shaped..but again if your a trek junky you cant go wrong... and if your not go out and buy DS9 The Way of The Warrior...what a killer episode..! Shall we sing songs about our victories in battle and drink Klingon blood wine? Well you just might if you ever see DS9 episode 73/74...",984355200,,1687,4.063063063063063
7871431,2,6304458606,"My son, who received this set for Christmas, called it a rip-off.  Half of the videos have fewer battle scenes than a typical Star Trek episode.  Any fan of any of the four Star Trek series will wonder from which cave the  editor crawled out of who selected these episodes.  Caveat Emptor! And I'd  advise carefully examining any other Star Trek box sets from Viacom.  It  was a disappointment.",949104000,15,394,4.6231884057971016
