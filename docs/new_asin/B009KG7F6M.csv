8542471,2,B009KG7F6M,"May rate better but got interrupted early on & have not gone back to it as early on it seemed much more juvenile than my taste ( I'm pretty juvy for an old broad).  But to be fair, I would have to say that a real juvenile audience would probably like it. It's just that you all do not have a received but not used selection.  Which by the way, the receiving end of most of my orders have almost always been excellent, the only complaint I have ever had was a lazy Fed X worker that didn't know the difference between a road & a circle.",1449619200,,535,3.9906542056074765

8542474,2,B009KG7F6M,"It had an O.K. story line, but it was slow and the acting is poor.  Total B movie, the filming is bad, borders on homemade.  It could be a good movie, if it had a better director, actors, editing.....etc.  Also, our disk arrived with skips in it.  It's not a big deal, since after watching the first 15min. of it, I decided to donate it to our public library.",1425686400,,359,4.159420289855072

8542476,3,B009KG7F6M,"Considering WHAT I p-a-i-d, and what I g-o-t ---- and being HONEST ---- I have to consider m-a-n-y things:
1.==> It is a Co-British/American/Romanian production. Dracula doesn't appear, but the Producer's first name is [also] Vlad.
2.==> BEING filmed IN Romania, it is understandable that there are [external wiring and] electrical light switches in the scenes
from the 1800s, thereby, probably, making ""more sense"" of fabricating a computer with JUST a repair manual & schematics.
3.==> Lip-syn-chro-ni-za-tion and di-a-logue matches up with the six lead actors, not so much with the dubbed Romanian extras.
4.==> Copyrighted 2012, the film is ""windowboxed"" with --- (you'll have to ZOOM to avoid) --- black bars on all four sides of your
widescreen TV... leading me to believe it's an OLDER film.
5.==> The SFX are probably on-par with Romania televion standards of about 2000.
6.==> The actors did their jobs very well. The storyline and direction was fine... for a discerning child, under 14.

I enjoyed the movie, but I am able to watch fantasies through the eyes of a child. If you think CITIZEN KANE and
CASABLANCA are top-five movies, you'll probably rate this at about T*W*O stars.",1383264000,4,1277,5.482233502538071
