1621206,2,B00005LDCH,"If you're under 13, this is not for you.  If you're above 18, why would you get this one?  May is a special robot, a cyberdoll with a maid program who lives with an engineering student Kazuya.  A cyberdoll with feelings?  Actually, those humanoid robots with feelings are nothing but old concepts already.  As much as this anime tries to be a touching comedy, there are more perverted scenes than comedic lines that you will notice.  No, it's not like Ranma 1/2.  Ranma 1/2 can be ecchi but Rumiko Takahashi knows how to concentrate on the great script and charm slapstick.  (...)",1005782400,,580,4.617647058823529
1621207,5,B00005LDCH,"I have to applaude the director for this show.  From scene to scene, the pacing is an example of how all anime and cartoons should be made.  You're given little room to anticipate the next joke, and what pulls it all together is the best bunch of characters ever pulled together for any show! (A warning: A lot of humor depends a lot on visual fan service)
I was wondering, though, if the second half of the series is essential.  Because the first five episodes can stand alone as an OVA that's as good as ""Oh My Goddess!""  I find episode 5 a particularly sweet and romantic episode.  Anyway, it's a good thing they made more stories involving May, and there seems to be something deeper that's brewing in the Cyberdyne Corporation--I can't wait to see the ending.",1003017600,3,764,4.507246376811594
1621208,5,B00005LDCH,"Actually, I was quite reluctant to purchase Hand Maid May as I feel that anime seems to be getting more and more expensive. However I decided to give it a try, and I definitely think I got my money's worth.
Satome Kazuya is a your typical comedy anime hero : poor, has weird friends, but is surrounded AND adored by girls and has genius level intellect. He's very much into computer programming, and is finalising an Artificial Intelligence program to be used in his squid robot, Ikariya (such a cute thing !!! If there were a soft toy of Ikariya I would definitely buy it). Insanely jealous of his past successes, his disgustingly rich best ""friend"" cum jealous rival from childhood, Nanbara, (perhaps the most obnoxious and yet endearingly FUNNY character to ever appear in an anime ever !!!) gives him a CD-ROM promising Satome that the software within contains the most up-to-date A.I program ever developed.
Not surprisingly, Satome, the most innocent character this side of Tenchi, loads the program which contains Nanbara's personal virus. Hijinks and laughter ensue as the virus is an insult program that proclaims Nanbara's everlasting greatness. (Hit the rewind button on this one over and over again...it's one of the funniest sequences in anime history !!!) With the virus uploaded into the computer, Satome accidentally orders a cyber doll from Cyberdyne, and thus, Hand Maid May is introduced into the series as a 1-foot cyberdoll that relies frequent recharging using a USB cable plugged into...erm...ahem...her unmentionables.
Every character in the Hand Maid May series is instantly lovable. You have the hero, Satome, who blushes constantly even though he seems to harbour a hidden desire to stare at the ""taboo"" areas of the females that surround him.
Then there is Kasumi, the tomboy but sentimental daughter of Kasumi hostel, who is not only Satome's best friend, but also shows a lot of romantic interest in Satome.
May, the cyberdoll, is sweet and innocent and is SOOOOO adorably cute !!! She always tries her best to help Satome with the housework and daily chores, but for the first few episodes, makes quite a mess of things.
And of course, Nanbara himself, the most HILARIOUS ""villain"" ever to appear in an anime !!! Nanbara is pompous and greedy, and most of the show's funniest moments involve him; if he's not being hit by giant stuffed bears or falling down from ladders, he's generally making a fool of himself by overexaggerating his movements and actions. The two other characters in the first four episodes, Rena, the child cyberdoll who has a penchant for being overly cute and getting her way through crying, and Sala, the ramen-devouring cyberdoll who appears to be a villain at first glance, but actually has a sensitive side AND a thing for Satome as well, are equally lovable and able to identify with. In fact, you should be able to identify with anyone of the characters, or at least know someone who resembles their personalities.
Hand Maid May is definitely a must-see for fans of Tenchi Muyo. In my opinion, it's much more hilarious, and the characters are definitely cuter than any other anime character, even Cardcaptor Sakura !!! The one thing I must caution you about though, is the amount of fan service in the series. There's a LOT of bouncy chests, bra straps slipping and panty shots, but there's no real nudity shown at all, nor is sex suggested at any time in the series. In fact, the fan service adds to the appeal of the show by making moments more awkward and thus funnier.
Both the opening and ending themes are catchy and will leave you humming at the beginning and after each episode. The ""Next episode"" blurbs don't make much sense though, you just get more of Nanbara screaming in his weird but endearingly humourous voice. Give this anime a try if you're looking for an anime with either (1) funny or (2) extremely cutesy characters and plots !!!

1621209,5,B00005LDCH,"This is SUCH a cute show! I rented it at my local anime store a few days after pioneer released it. I loved it! Kazuya's always blushing and it reminds me SO much of Tenchi Muyo! and Love Hina.
Yes there is oodles of fan service (panty shots, bouncy chests) but i would NOT go so far as to call it a hentai. There's no sex, and kazuya just blushes while the girls make comments, if you've seen some of Ryoko's antics from Tenchi Muyo! then this won't bother you a bit, especially if you saw the Tenchi Muyo! hot springs episode. I'd say, no younger than 12 years old for kids watching this. I'm a girl so i pretty much just brushed all that fan service aside in my mind. Now for males it will be different. But still, its so cute!! And the opening theme is great too!",1001116800,,767,4.12
1621210,5,B00005LDCH,"Hand Maid May is the story of Kazuya Saotome and his misadventures with his pint size robotic maid named May. At first glance one might brush off HMM as just another Anime with loads of fan service. Though, indeed the show does have alot of it, it never ecalates to the point where it ruins the show. Infact, what really drives this show are the emotions and relationships that the characters have for and with each other. Oh and what characters this show has! I can honestly say the character designs are truly wonderful and are quite a site to behold. They are some of the most likeable charaters to date and really win your fancy quickly. I look forward to seeing what happens to the characters and finding out the fates of Kazuya and May. If you enjoyed Magic Users Club then you'll really like HMM. I highly recommend it:)",998784000,3,827,4.483443708609271
1621211,5,B00005LDCH,"I was expecting sexist jokes and very suggestive themes.  Though the opening episodes start off with a lot of panty and cleavage shots, there is nothing even softcore about it.  But plenty of fanservice, yes--but it's not overdone, because as the episodes progress the focus shifts to personal interaction. Anyway, this title is one of a few that begs to be watched again and again:  the story is sophisticated, the characters are lovable, the animation, though simple, is effective.  Also, the dubbing is great--the jokes are all effectively conveyed, which is not easy, because some characters are whacked out most of the time.  As for May, she's just plain adorable.  Can't wait to see the rest of the series.",998352000,2,712,4.9411764705882355
1621212,5,B00005LDCH,"This disc contains the first 4 episodes of the 11 episode show Hand Maid May.  There's no question HMM is a terribly cute and funny show.  The basic dynamics are fairly common in anime: quiet, sensitive boy finds himself surrounded by interested girls.  In poor Kazuya's case, most of the girls are androids--and one of those is a maid named May who's the size of a Barbie.  The hows and whys of this all make sense within the context of the show; the drama (to the extent there is any, for this is a comedy) involves how Kazuya's going to pay the $1.45 million bill for May, or otherwise keep her from being repossessed.  The character designs range from adorable to gorgeous, and the English dub cast is filled with experienced voice actors who do great jobs.
There's only two potentially negative things to say about HMM.  Neither made me lower my rating, but they might affect yours.  First, this show is filled to overflowing with fan service: camera angles showing girls' underwear, girls bending over, and just generally bouncy girls.  There's no actual nudity--it almost seems like an experiment to see how far a show can go and still remain mostly cute.  While I could do without so much, it's basically innocent: Kazuya's too shy to do anything about it except blush.
The second problem is the annoying DVD menu: when the disc loads, you're presented with a puzzle of sorts; you can't watch anything without figuring it out.  It's an exact copy of the Japanese DVD release, so purists might like it, but it slows things down, doesn't make any sense, and doesn't add to the show in any way.  Hopefully, future discs will have better menus, but HMM is a 5 star show despite these issues.",998265600,2,1695,4.635451505016722
1621213,5,B00005LDCH,"Hand Maid May is an excellent show. If you are a fan of New-Age Anime this is a must have for your collection. I'd recomend it to anybody who want's a laugh. It's has alot in common with shows like Love Hina and Tenchi so expect alot of charater development and off-the-wall situations. Now on DVD, the deal is even sweeter. 75 minutes of HMM along with some DVD extras makes this a great buy.  The only other thing worth mentioning is that it has quite a bit of Fan Service, so if your looking for another Pokemon, steer clear, But otherwise, it just makes it even funnier. Buy it. Watch it. Laugh and smile because it's one of the best new shows out there.",998179200,4,658,4.264
1621214,5,B00005LDCH,"(Note: This review is based on watching the original Japanese edition.  Based on other Pioneer dubs I have watched, not much should be changed for the English dubbed version.)
Kazuya Saotome is a college student who lives at the Kasumi Sou (Inn). His dream is to build a doraemon (robot). He is always being followed by his school rival Kotaro Nanbara. One day Kotaro gives Kazuya a computer disc. Kazuya runs the disc, which turns out to be a net virus. While the virus was running, unknowing to Kazuya, an order is placed at the Cyberdyne Co. Several minutes later, there's a knock on the door. Kazuya receives a parcel. Inside the box is CBD May, a cyberdoll about 1/6 the size of a human girl. The doll is an excellent work of artificial intelligence. Once Kotaro finds out about May, he is doing whatever he can to get the cyberdoll. But Kotaro is not the only one. The Cyberdyne Co. is also looking for payment of the US$1.45 million price tag for the CBD May.
This anime series, although short (10 episodes plus a ""video only"" episode), is truely a winner. Hand Maid May allows you to use your imagination and realize that it does not matter what someone is (human or cyberdoll), you can care for them just the same.  Overall, I give this series an A-.
Parents: Hand Maid May is the story of a boy who has several lifelike robots (cyberdolls) fall in love with him. Almost every episode contains at least one or two borderline ecchi (suggestive) references such as bouncing breasts and up the skirt scenes that many animes are known for.

Still, I give it credit for being consistently entertaining, fun, and featuring really funny characters.  It's great to see a ""harem"" anime where the women are actually friendly and not out to kill each other.  I love the energy of the quasi-villian, too.

However, as cute and funny as Hand Maid May is, the show also has its fair share of touching moments, especially in the middle and the end.  If it weren't for the irritating OVA, this anime would be really great, if not original.  As it is, it's just good, but that still makes this show well worth your time.

1621238,5,B00005LDCH,"I had heard about this series when I got ""I Dream of Mimi"". It was made to sound rather...risque. Some were calling it Hentai. I figured that it couldn't be as risque as ""Mimi"" was.
Turns out I was right.
This was a sweet story. Some would say a bit predictable...
True...but no more so than in most superhero comics.
Almost all the characters were likeable (Sorry, Kotoro, you're a BIT too much over the top, even for an anime...), filled with life, convincing, and enjoyable to watch. The plotline, for the most part, was solid, as well.
However, I did think that the aforementioned plotline began to fragment a bit as it neared the conclusion, just when I was beginning to hope that everything would all come together and be answered. (Most specifically, time travel and causality regarding Kazuya/Kotaro and thier destinies). (I would've preferred the 11th episode to address these logical problems, rather than being the enjoyable 'filler' episode that it came off being, IMO.) Then again, that MAY be intentional on the creators' part, and it may all be resolved if they choose to do more episodes in the future. I DO hope they do so, as the characters all but BEG to be developed further...
The additional CD in this set was was enjoyable to read through, with behind-the-scenes info on the series, the characters, and the creators.
(I thought that Kotoro's 'music area' on disk #1 was cute, but unnecessary.)
The audio character snippits in the 4 DVD's were enjoyable. I'd love to put them as sounds on my computer.
All told, even with those few minor quibbles, I heartily believe I got my money's worth with this set. It's another gem for my growing anime collection and WELL worth the money, IMHO.

1621240,3,B00005LDCH,"I really wanted to like this series, and for the first few episodes I did. Saotome, Kasumi and May make for an enjoyable show. But once Kei, Mami, Rena, Sara, and the annoying Nambara get added to the mix, the show is just diluted beyond hope. It's a Tenchi / Hina formula that just doesn't work and too many characters are just plain annoying.
Not to give anything away, but later in the show things come together and wrap up rather well, if quite a bit stretched. The ending is quite nice. This series had a chance of being great, but it ends up simply sub par. If you really like Robo Girl series and Tenchi / Hina series, give it a shot. The first few and last few episodes are quite worth watching. Sadly, the middle is rather filler.

1621244,4,B00005LDCH,"This is the final DVD of the Hand Maid May series. It contains the final 3 episodes plus the bonus episode 11 which was not originally intended. In the final three episodes, May and Kazuya have one final outing together before a nasty virus hits their CBD (cyber-doll) family. May is immune and with Kasumi and Kazuya, they try to save the cyber-dolls. In the bonus 11th episode, we have what I would call a holiday special.
To the credit of the writers of this series, the ending of the series (episode 10) was actually not what I expected. So I was very pleased with that. Episode 11 isn't animated as well and the story is pretty weak other than to make Kasumi decide that she's going to fight for Kazuya's love and not let a bunch of cyber doll's win his heart (especially since they can have kids). NOTE: A fansub version of this episode has Mami-san telling Kasumi that Kazuya wants to have kids and that Kasumi *can* have them -- implying that the cyber dolls cannot. I don't know which translation is correct which is why I need to learn Japanese!
The problem with the series continues to be the copious amounts of fan-service that are all over the place. They even manage to include it inside the DVD packaging! Otherwise, this kawaii (cute) series is pretty good.
As to the DVD, the same problems exist as on the previous ones. There are limited extras and there isn't a limited subtitle option for the English dub. The dubbing is done well and a credit to the English producer/director! The entire series should have been placed on 2 DVD's rather than spread it over three.
Bottom line: if you can get past all of the fan-service in this series, get all 3 DVD's.  The English voice actors do a great job of capturing the spirit of the characters and the feel of the original Japanese seiyuu's.",1041033600,,1804,4.5

This series is very kawaii (Japanese for cute), sweet, and who can not love May?  Unfortunately, the fan-service (gratuitous showing of panties, jiggling breasts, etc.) is so severe at times that it tends to overwhelm the story.  Not that the story is deep mind you, but a lack of fan-service would have helped tremendously (IMO).
The DVD contains few extras.  Unlike in the first DVD, there is no annoying pre-menu to go through.  That is good.  I wish that Pioneer had had a 3rd audio option in addition to English dub, Japanese, and full subtitles.  A limited subtitle option with the English dub (or Japanese) would have been nice.  This way, songs and Japanese text would be subtitled rather than the all-or-nothing approach.
Speaking of dubbing, the English dub is really pretty good!  The voice actors do a really good job at capturing the spirit of the characters.  The only thing lost is in the use of Japanese titles (-kun, -chan, -san, etc.).  English doesn't have proper translations for such titles, but I think I would have allowed them to stay in the English version.  A small glossary in the extras could have educated the ignorant as to these terms.

1621268,5,B00005LDCH,"This is one of those series that you're almost embarrassed to admit that you like. The packaging leads you to believe it's another cutesy anime, until you open it and find a few...er, revealing drawings on the insert. The packaging is more ecchi than the series, although the series does have its moments (some of which give the old Gainax bounce a run for its money). Once you actually start watching the series, though, you're likely to become addicted to it very quickly. Sure, the genre's been done before, but not to my knowledge with a 1/6th human sized ""cyberdoll"" as the star. You really start caring about May, Kazuya, and Kasumi as the series progresses. Even the 'bad guys' are fun, especially given their high rate of defection to May's/Kazuya's side (Sara is one of my all-time favorite 'nemesis' characters now - watch the series and you'll see why). This DVD wraps up the series with 3 regular episodes and a special bonus that was only included on the original Japanese DVD set. If you enjoyed the drama of the middle episodes, you'll really love the way the series ends - while it's no dramatic masterpiece, it's extremely well done for a show of this type. You'll also love the bonus episode, which is arguably the funniest one of the series. All in all, it's a show worth your time - as long as you can see past the gratuitous panty shots, that is. ;-)",1008201600,7,1371,4.5772357723577235
1621269,4,B00005LDCH,"It was hard to determine whether this series was shonen or shojo, but I'll have to say it's definitely shonen with its excessive fanservice and 5:1 female:male ratio.  Though the fanservice is not extreme, many people might be put off by it.  I loved it until the later episodes, where it served as inappropriate distraction to a wonderful story that tells of everything we wanted to know about the characters and plot--how Kazuya and Kasumi met, who is behind the Cyberdyne Corporation, etc.  The director seems to have lost the magic but then resumes the nonstop character comedy in episode 11.  The animation is pleasant but feels too digital.  The concluding plot seems to have been hurriedly put together, but the way it's executed is heartwarming.  And there's the 11th episode as well!",1008115200,,792,4.917293233082707

Just for a word of caution, if you want a nice complete conclusion, don't hold your breath.  I would hardly call the end of the show a conclusion, but more of a soon to be continued, even though the show is no longer in the making.

1621271,4,B00005LDCH,"Being a college student, I don't particularly have much time on my hands to watch a full 26-episode series consistantly, so I'm working with spurts of Anime.  Enter Hand Maid May, which is a sweet 11 episodes about a computer programmer who accidently orders an expensive, 5-inch maid online, and the funny events that happen afterwards.
Granted, the majority of characters are female, and there is an emphasis of fan service (hence the 13+ warning).  However, there's no nudity nor adult situations, and the comedic elements kept me pleased with the anime overall.
Although more than half of the time the series is just introducing characters, there's still an underlying plot (pretty imaginative, and not often used in anime, either) that ties everything together.
And the characters, both male and female, have their redeeming charms, which you'll soon impersonate.  (best do it when you're alone, though, to save yourself from looking like the greatest idiot in the world.
The DVD compliments this even further, thanks to Pioneer.  A lot of nice extras to be seen in the DVD, and after the first few episodes, you'll like the menu even more.
Overall, if you're looking for something quick, funny, and at times sentimental, then Hand Maid May is just the thing for you.",1007078400,7,1272,4.985849056603773

It's all silly-cute, I guess.
Actually, the part I find offensive is the antagonist, Nanbara. His voice and actions are so painfully annoying, I found myself muting him whenever he made an appearance. I can't tell you how much I hate that character, and when you first pop in the DVD, it opens to ""Nanbara's Room"" which is just too excrutiating to describe.

7943724,4,B00005LDCH,"This was a very enjoyable series, even watching it 8 years after it's vintage release date for the first time. At first, I had my reservations watching this series, I'm an avid anime fan who likes some semblance of groundedness in the plot. With the subject matter being about robotic maids, I thought it might end up being like some sort of parody with tons of fan service and not really taking the romance seriously at all.

In actuality, after watching, I can tell you that I was able to take the series fairly seriously despite the fan service and some of the rather, ""over the top"" comedic scenes you'll see in some romantic comedies. Overall, the series is rather an innocuous one, I would say it has a lot in common with shows like Chobits and Ah! My Goddess. Though there is a TON of fan service, the romantic relationships are developed in a platonic way.

Among the half dozen female characters, most are there just to liven things up, even the villain is more fun than menacing. Think of Urd & Skuld arguing over who gets to watch their favorite series on TV(If you haven't watched AMG, imagine the antics of two sisters arguing over watching a drama or a guy's all action show). That's what you get with the character interactions outside of the main couple. As for the main couple, this is where the focus of the plot is for the greater portion of the series. Most of the ""meat"" of the show deals with May, a robotic cyberdoll developing and understanding her ""emotions"" mostly concerning love, over the main protagonist, Kazuya, a college student who is also interested in creating AI. At first it would seem that all emotions concerning sentimental things are completely foreign to her. As for whether she can experience these feelings at al or not, it is revealed she is able to experience emotions just like a real human being. As the episodes go on, May comes to better understand the more sentimental parts of life and her own feelings and appreciation of past experiences. As the relationship between May and Kazuya develops, we're also introduced to more and more characters, who are mostly just there to keep things fun.

Okay, now I'm going to talk about the issues I have with the series, unfortunately I can't address these issues without giving major spoilers so:

WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!

The formula of advancing their ""innocent"" romantic relationship and having amusing scenes with the various characters each episode gets interrupted near the end of the series as a ""Plot Explosion"" arrives. This is where I start to have issues with the series. Prior to this, at the 2nd to last episode, The series starts to get serious by talking about the nature of what gives a robot it's personality, and how memories and life experiences are what make them special and unique. They also talk about how important memories are, and how May desires to have more special memories, such as the memories May has from going out on a date with Kazuya to an amusement park(which is featured in a previous episode). So far this is all good and sits well with me, I'm actually starting to get attached to the characters at this point, and as I think this series is starting to pick up pace and race toward a very sweet and sentimental conclusion between the characters, the utterly ridiculous plot twists arrive.

Personal Comment: Okay, be prepared for a very long diatribe, which may go over your head, but it really does contain some serious thoughts about some of the more mature themes one might face with such a series, so I encourage you to try to read and understand it. The following two very long paragraphs is a detailed explanation of what I thought wasn't well explained in the series, and after that, is what I would have liked to have seen them do to make a more solid series.

All of a sudden, at the second to last episode, the plot device of having time travel is introduced to us, as shadowy characters who are seen to be spying on our protagonist for a second or two a couple times from previous episodes but never explained are revealed to actually be time travelers who are descendants of our protagonists from the far off future. Apparently they've come because a ""retro virus"" from the past has occured which will wipe out the memories of all the cyber dolls in the future. As previously discussed, the loss of memories for a cyber doll is roughly equivalent to death for a human. All of the cyber dolls are infected, except for May, who has a rapidly evolving operating system which is able to protect her from the virus. Why she has this is not clearly explained; either it is a result of having spent time with Kazuya, or that she has a unique OS that has been programmed from Kazuya from the future. Anyway, the plot holes are not that big of a deal, given that this series was not to be very realistic in the first place, but rather focus on relationships and amusement. The real plot twist occurs when May decides to have the viruses transferred to her and have her deal with all the viruses herself (how a virus can be transferred from one cpu to another and be deleted from the transferee, but couldn't just be deleted I have no idea, another problem I see is that it also doesn't mean immunity from the virus if something similar were to occur in the future as well.) And they do mean transfer, because, as a key point of this plot twist, is that May must store the data of the viruses somewhere, apparently an ""empty"" black box component has been installed inside each cyberdoll. After much debate whether the procedure is safe or not for May, our protagonists decide to use this box as the place to store the virus for May to wipe out seeing as how it is ""empty"".

After having all the viruses transferred to her, May is able to heal the viruses in all the cyber dolls in the present and the future. But at the same time cyberdolls are regaining conciousness; in perhaps what could have been one of the most bittersweet scenes ever, May is revealed to have completely lost her memory as she repeats the lines from when she is first introduced in the series, apparently the empty black box, is a place which is used by cyberdolls to store their memories. And this, puzzling to me, is pretty much where the series ends, after a scene of shock where the characters react over how she has lost her memory, they come together and all vow to help May(Who is confused and has no idea why everyone is acting so strangely, as she just lost all her memories) in her ""second life"".

This last scene is hardly satisfying, after having talked about how having ones memories wiped would be equivalent to death for a cyber doll, I would have liked to have seen additional episodes with Kazuya coping with the fact that May is no longer the same cyber-doll or person as he came to know her. I would have liked to have seen how he deals with the conflicting memories he has of the past May and her present self, and how he treats her knowing that she no longer has those memories. I would have also liked to have seen there relationship blossom more, at least to a point where they know eachothers feelings. The way the series ends is a lot like the way the series starts, there is a beginning, a middle, and then a new beginning, ignoring all the crazy plot holes, at the conclusion of the story, I think there is still room for a much more dramatic half of a series. Maybe some of the plot holes could be addressed in this half as well. However, we just get a 11th episode which appears to be filled with filler and doesn't deal with issues associated wtih May at all, but rather random jokes between the characters. The 11th episode is filled with all original content, but does nothing to advance existing relationships or the plot. Perhaps they intended to have a filler episode before advancing the story again? I believe the story was an original story created just for the TV anime... (As opposed to a manga or visual/light novel adaptation) what their exact intentions were is hard to tell.

All in all, Hand Maid May is a good series, well worth watching, but if you watch anime seriously like I do, be prepared to scratch your head a little at the conclusion and to feel like you wanted a different ending or there to be more episodes. Also, if you want a deeper look into the relationship and problems one may face with a robot/human relationship, Chobits does a really good job at elaborating this theme, I would also say Chobits has a lot less fan service and has a more serious tone, though it is still very fun and facetious at times.",1232323200,,8578,4.524822695035461
7943725,1,B00005LDCH,"When writing this review I had to click the ""I am over the age of 13"" and maybe that's the problem and why I disliked this anime.  You must be 13 or under male to enjoy this series.  If you like a lot of fanservice you'll love this series and I'm not saying I don't like a little fanservice but this series seems nothing but.  They beat you over the head until you beg for them to stop.  The start menu is confusing and I almost thought I had a defective disk until I hit every option and it took me to the real menu.  The villian is extremely annoying and Sara whose main job is to repo May is incompetent.  It's story after story of how they fail to repo May along with panty shot after panty shot.  You'll never mistake this for any anime with a substantial plot.  I understand this is harem anime but there are good series that fit under the genre.  Gertrude Stein once said, ""A rose is a rose is a rose"" meaning things are what they are.  This anime is a turd is a turd is a turd.",1183161600,,985,4.005128205128205
7943726,4,B00005LDCH,"I'm kind of up in the air about this series.  While the amazon review basically calls it a waste of time, I don't agree.  Hand Maid May is a short and sweet series.  While it is basically a harem comedy ala Love Hina or Steel Angel Kurumi, it did have a couple of elements that made it stand out.

1.  Unlike Hideki in Chobits, or the guy from Love Hina, Kazuya strikes me as a nice, NORMAL guy.  I still, to this day, can't figure out Hideki's attraction, but Kazuya generally seems to care about everything, and everyone.  This helps to explain everyone's attraction to him.  OK, I got that

2.  May is a very sweet character.  She tries very hard, and she seems genuine.  Or, as genuine as an anime character can be.  This point comes in handy when you have to belive her love for Kazuya.  I'm sorry, but the romance in Steel Angel Kurumi was unrealistic, and as much as I love Chobits...I never once believed Chi had anything approaching feelings.  May, however, makes me believe.

3.  I didn't feel any of the ridiculousness of characters I did in Love Hina.  Naru, for instance, drove me nuts with her Keitaro, you pervert shouts every 5 minutes.  Come on...cut the guy a break...especially when it isn't his fault.  Ahem.  While Mom was over the top, I felt that the characters in HMM were very genuine and entertaining.

4.  This is SHORT!  You almost can't get hung up on the oddities or inconsistencies in this series because it is so short.  11 episodes does not take too long to watch, and the story wrapped up quite nicely by the end.  (unlike ANYTHING by gainax!)

All in all, I'd say this series is worth the watch.  It is a heartwarming, if unoriginal, tale.",1119225600,11,1674,4.435643564356436

7943728,3,B00005LDCH,"this is an alright show nothing great but enjoyable. it centers around a guy named kazuya who accidently orders a miniature cyberdoll maid named may who does your typical maid things like cleaning house, cooking etc. as time passes they start getting feelings for each other but then comes the part of this show that really irks me.

this is an 11 episode series and that is way way to few to keep adding all these new characters every episode. the show is just fine with kazuya may and the nextdoor neighbor kasumi(more on her later) and one of the them comes at nearly the very end of the show you hardly even get a chance to know her. they are all cyber maids who for one reason or another hang around kazuya. there are just too many characters and there is absolutely zero character development except for a little bit from may if that even counts. by the time the show is over you won't know much about the other cyber maids that you wouldnt have figured out 10 seconds after seeing them for the first time.

there are a lot of girls so that means there has to be fanservice, about 95% of this comes from kasumi who always seems to at just the right angle that gives you a shot right up her skirt so you can see her panties. every episode has at least 1 panty shot and everytime she ""accidently"" flashes them kazuya always peeks. not really recommened for younger viewers.

 i cant really say the plot is rushed as there really isn't much in the way of a plot. the next door neighboor kasumi and may have a crush on the kazuya and they feud at times, the other girls supposedly have a crush on him too but youd have a hard time telling at times. when it gets near the end of the series it is somewhat interesting and does get to be a little better but then before you know it the show is over abruptly, the ending did not feel like a real ending i was not satisfied with it.

if you have 5 hours to kill this is an enjoyable watch and its actually not as predictable as some other animes(ok i know thats not saying much but there are a couple scenes that may surprise you)but after its over you will either wish it was longer or wasn't that impressed with it, it just leaves you with a sense of incompleteness if you can i would just rent it or borrow it from someone unless your just into shows with lots of girls and lots of panty shots and if your that type then there are plenty of better choices",1113177600,5,2405,4.20824295010846

May's debut was a plea to Kazuya.  That actually made me go ""A[...]""  If your into Anime with extremely high cuteness and comedy, then Hand maid May is for you.  It will make a wonderful addition to your DVD Anime library.
