4192554,3,B003TPZSOG,"I guess I am in the minority of reviewers but I thought that this was OK.  It was far from being the worst film ever made. It is rather slow-moving and in some cases inexplicable. everything about it is just ""ok"". It is not a complicated plot so it is a good movie to watch while you are folding the clothes or paying the bills rather than sitting in front of the computer with your popcorn.",1449705600,,391,4.144736842105263

The acting is terrible, the story makes little sense, and it feels like its trying to build suspense, but much like Dark Waters there isn't a payoff. Everything about this movie is misleading and feels like most of the budget was embezzled or very poorly spent.",1445558400,,478,4.494252873563219

It starts slow, builds up to even slower and by the time its over you are almost asleep.

4192666,4,B003TPZSOG,"The six people who reviewed this film before me sound like they prefer gory, paint-by-numbers nonsense.  ""Wake the Witch"" is an independent, low-budget homage to campy horror films of the 80s - except that it is thought-provoking and has character development.  It is definitely scary, and the people in hoodies are particularly frightening.  I liked the camera work.  The dream sequences look especially great.  The piano refrain is very creepy and effective, and the editing is quite good too.  Yes, Meryl Streep is not in this movie - the less-than-stellar acting gives the movie the feel of one of those crappy B-horror movies of the 70s and 80s, but that's what I liked about it because it reminded me of the scary films of my youth - enhanced with a real story and characters and a terrifying, dreadful ambience.  The ending is very weird and confusing, but that made me want to watch it again - plus, I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.

If you are a horror fan who appreciated the genre in the 70s/80s, and you also appreciate independent films with substance, then you will like ""Wake the Witch.""  I still have nightmares about those hoodie freaks.",1331683200,,1168,4.742574257425742
4192667,2,B003TPZSOG,"Okay, so I go to college for film making and so I kind of watched this film from that point of view. I saw that most of the time the continuity was just right, the acting was okay, even though I thought the mom was actually their mom...I liked how the movie was actually long and built slow. It kept my attention, and I found it interesting and actually the movie wasn't too bad. It's just the acting was bad. The movie kept my attention going. BUT OMG once I found out this wasn't actually a in-college film I was surprised! I was going to give this film 3 stars but now it deserves 1 1/2 to 2 since this was actually a budgeted film!!! I could do as good or even better if I had the time in college and a lot of people to help right now!!! Wow, and the cover looks like a rip off of Drag  Me to Hell which was actually a descent movie! Liked the movie, until I found out it wasn't a student film...",1330646400,3,900,3.972375690607735
4192668,3,B003TPZSOG,"The movie starts out slow and builds slow. Stefanie Tapio (lone movie credit) plays a credible Deb Allen. The story centers around her, her family problems, boyfriend problems and desire to be a photographer. I thought her acting skills were quite good, however the rest of the cast and much of the dialouge left something to be desired. This low budget movie suffered from bad camera angles, such as showing us the back of someone's head while they are talking, or the facial closeup of Deb's mom (Barbara Elias) while she is having breakfast.

While taking pictures of her 2 girlfriends (Karis Yanike and Rachel Lien) in the woods, the girls uncover a buried chain, which according to local legend was used to hang a witch. The girls play a game called, ""Wake the Witch"" so they can ask the witch questions about their boyfriends. Afterwards, strange events slowly start to happen.

The ending of the film was unexpected. The picture spent too much time focusing on Deb Allen instead of leaving clues for the twist. The movie is more of a mystery than a horror film. Good low budget effort that can be improved upon.

4192669,1,B003TPZSOG,"This is not a professionally made movie.  So low budget it feels like a student made-film - middle school student.  Production companies make the big bucks for a reason and even Paranormal Activity, a relatively low budget movie, was produced with a basic level of quality.  This is not scary or watchable.  We shut this movie off after 20 minutes and it was pretty unbearable the entire time.  Do not waste your time or money.",1311552000,3,427,4.64

8405394,1,B003TPZSOG,"If I recall this cinematic abortion was on Netflix a long while back. Didn't find an audience there neither appears it's finding one here. It's just bad, sloppy, and insipid film making. Definitely not worth the rental.",1509926400,,219,4.945945945945946
8405395,4,B003TPZSOG,"If you're going into Wake the Witch expecting a witch to walk around tormenting people, guess again!  The story's actually about a teenage girl named Deb who brings her three friends to the woods to have a conversation and to have fun.  At least that's the way it appears.  It's actually a park where mysterious things have happened in the past, and continue to happen.  These girls aren't aware of it though.  Not yet!  I'm not sure it's intentional or not but the music and the dreary picture quality strongly resembles that of a 70's horror which means I enjoy it a lot.  The soundtrack's weird in that it'll resemble the 70's trademark style moody keyboards and synths one second, then switch into noisy heavy metal the next.  At least the heavy metal stuff is kept to a minimum since the 70's resembling stuff sounds a lot better to me!

Anyway nothing happens during the first 10 minutes.  One of the friends scratches her knee.  The other friend plays a joke on Deb and the other friend that she's missing only to appear before they drive away in the car.  When Deb comes home, well for the next 30-40 minutes the film is basically about the life of a drama-filled teenage girl.  She walks into her brother Mark's bedroom where he's sick from something the mother thinks is West Nile but isn't sure until he visits a doctor.  The mother herself has a downbeat negative way about her pesonality.  She's not really strict and never lashes out towards Deb or Mark.  She just has high expectations of Deb's career choices.  She does care about Deb though.

Meanwhile Deb takes a drive downtown to meet up with her boyfriend.  They get into a little argument prompting Deb to return home, ask Mark who's now downstairs watching TV why men are so terrible, and goes online for a while.  She takes a visit to the basement to fix the modem.  The movie teases something is lurking down there and that Deb's afraid to walk to the basement, but no, there's nothing there.  As for her boyfriend, he only appears one more time and it's when Deb confronts him as he's making out with another girl.  Deb actually believes him when he says he plans to marry Deb and just has to get his life straightened out first.  Those aren't his exact words, but yeah!  I don't believe him!

This movie improves when Deb and her two female friends from the opening scene take another walk through the woods.  Actually it's called Wilderness Park but they look like woods to me!  Something hits the one friend on the head creating blood.  She leaves and goes to the hospital.  The other friend disappears too, in a much more dramatic way.  Later on Deb and this friend go to the park again to retrieve her friend's phone.  You know teens- they can't live without their phones!  They gotta have it!  Much like I can't live without my computer as an adult, lol.  Anyway they see men walking through the trees and decide whether to chase them down or not.  They definitely decide NOT to chase them down when these weird children-like people crawl around on the ground... at a pretty good speed!  They can crawl almost as fast as Deb and her friend can run!  Deb gets away but her friend is captured and dragged somewhere.  Deb tries to run to her car but is greeted by her brother Mark.  He blows something in her face and Deb passes out only to wake up in her car.

It should be said that Mark's behavior is quite unusual.  He's happy and sharing stories about owls one minute.  Then he gets angry and frustrated the next demanding Deb needs to be here to take care of her mother (who's now sick with the same virus that infected Mark).  When Mark leaves to return to his apartment, he thinks Deb's amazing for the way she's growing up and has become a beautiful young woman.  Come on Mark, get your emotions straightened out man!  You can't go from angry to happy like that!

Meanwhile when Deb needs Mark and can't find him, she heads to his apartment and meets up with his roommate.  The guy admits he intended to hit on her but changed his mind when he realized Deb is Mark's sister.  They become friends however.  Meanwhile Mark is missing.  Deb and Mark's roommate do some investigating on Wilderness Park.  The roommate returns with all kinds of notes on the matter.  At first it seems some kind of strange bacteria infected the park and hobos used to invade the property, but more reading reveals that earlier on, in the early 1900's, a witch used to live there.  She'd take kids and kill them.  Right after this Deb and Mark's roommate turn around (since they're in a parking garage) and see a masked man up ahead.  Rather strange, when they approach he disappears.  What?  Deb even had a big rock in hand ready to throw!

Anyway periodically Deb has dreams about her missing friends and brother.  She has one dream she's in the living room talking to her friend (the one who had a bleeding head).  Suddenly the friend switches to another part of the room and disappears.  Deb dreams her other friend is lying on the ground and being pulled across the park grounds, basically what really happened but not quite the same.  The dream about Mark is the oddest though.  She's visiting him in a basement and he's chained to a wall with blood everywhere.  She turns around and a big figure is now standing behind her.  This spooks her awake.

Hilarious the way the town cop acts towards Debbie.  He comes over to question the disappearance of Debbie's friends and does everything except accuse Debbie of being involved in some way.  For whatever reason he's stubborn and refuses to hear the possibility that her friends were dragged away by mysterious people in the woods.  Maybe he's in on it!  When the cop comes by again he's just as ignorant as before.  He can't question the mom because she's sick and in bed.  Of course he shows no sympathy.

Basically Deb's only friend is Mark's roommate.  The movie really loses focus during the final 30 minutes.  All this pretty good atmosphere and storyline leads to a disappointing finale I think.  The movie's never really clear what's going on in the woods.  We can only conclude a witch is involved based on the movie title, but we never actually see it.  Instead we see cob webs covering the doorknobs of Deb's front door and the neighbors front door, indicating whatever's in the woods is causing the virus around town and beginning to spread its evil presence.

Then the story loses me in a big way.  First Deb and Mark's roommate sit in his apartment trying to figure out what to do.  This lasts a long time.  The roommate leaves... then the next day Deb leaves and heads to the park.  She brings a metal rod with her as protection.  This wasn't the plan was it?  Who knows.  This creates another long-winded segment with Deb walking through the woods and seeing her friend's sister dead on the ground.

She stumbles into a cave where Mark is chained to the wall like in her dream, but instead of saving him she questions what he's doing here and accuses him of being responsible for the chaos in the woods.  We see a skeleton of a lady sitting close by that Mark tries to protect for some twisted reason.  The footage is so dark it's incredibly hard to see anything.  I have no idea what happens at the end.  Due to the extremely dark picture I can only guess I hear the sound of a witch screaming while dragging Mark through the walls.  After this I was convinced I saw a witch on top of Deb, but it was actually just the poor picture creating an illusion and it's just Deb's arm resting on her chest.  Oops!  Then the movie ends.  Huh, what was that?  Haha.  So our only proof of a witch is the movie title and the likelihood I'm hearing a witch scream near the end.  These are the only signs a witch is responsible for the viruses spreading around town and the increase in cob webs.  None of this explains the weird creature people crawling around on the ground either, and who they are.

Overall Wake the Witch is pretty good.  Okay the first 10 minutes doesn't do anything.  The teenage drama after that is only passable and isn't everyone's cup of tea, but perhaps the setting taking place in a small town with a mysterious park close by is what elevates the atmosphere more than I was expecting.  The movie feels dreary and a little spooky the whole time to me which helps in my book.  The final 30 minutes is a big mess though.  None of that stuff made sense to me.",1499299200,,8405,4.478547854785479
