The art work is very good, and the story line and drama fixes within the classical book. I found this to be both educational and entertaining. I only wish this has English sub titles.",1484438400,,291,4.214285714285714
7899953,5,7799822686,"Fantastic animated series of classic novel ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms."" The series introduces each major player by putting their name briefly on the screen, and the Chinese subtitles are perfect if you are studying Chinese. Highly recommended!",1406332800,,247,5.526315789473684
7899954,5,7799822686,"I watched the 52 episodes with my two kids (one in middle school, one in elementary). All of us love it. Romance of Three Kingdoms is one of the Chinese classics. The story follows closely to the original book. All the characters are beautifully illustrated. A lot of traditional Chinese idioms have came from the original book and are covered in the episodes. In short, it is beautifully done!",1348272000,3,394,4.72463768115942
