5214593,2,B0090SI55A,"If you liked the first one, then you'll like this one just as much.
For me, the first one was very forgettable and this one is no different.
Sandler is once again looking to just have some summer fun and get paid to do it. There is no real story to this movie. The entire plot could have been told in a 2 minute trailer. The rest of the time is a bunch of goofing off and some awkward situations. There are some funny lines in the movie, so it wasn't a bore. You get to see a lot of your favorite Sandler buddies and a few other surprises. Humor is not a crude as he can get like in other movies so was tolerable for a family. Some of his cruder/dumber movies I just won't watch at all. This one somehow kept me watching the entire movie. It all depends on what you are looking for in a movie. It was a fun movie, but a complete waste of time as far as I'm concerned.
Don't be surprised if there's a part 3 next summer.",1375747200,9,919,3.946236559139785
5214594,4,B0090SI55A,"If you like watching family movies and like seeing/hearing family jokes, then this is for you! Otherwise, you hate this movie and should stay far, far, away!

Yes, I found myself laughing for most of the movie. Since, I'm watching a comedy, I'm expecting to laugh, so it did deliver. I found the story wasn't really there and nothing too special. Just Adam Sandler and friends moving back to their old town and living their lives there. They get into funny situations and do funny things. The acting was fairly well done, and the directing was good for the most part.

So, I thought Grown Ups 1 was very average movies, and I gave it 3 stars. Grown Ups 2 was better than 1, so I will give it 4 stars for that reason. Again, I recommend this movie if you like family jokes.",1375488000,,772,4.354166666666667
5214595,2,B0090SI55A,"The sequel comes with very little plot. Our foursome all have their child issues. David Spade suddenly has a long lost son so he doesn't miss out on the fun. There is an 80's theme party with a ridiculous townies vs. college boys fight.

The humor is still crude, but perhaps a bit less than before as I found it tolerable. The film mostly relies on one liners and insults as is typical in a Sandler production. This film also highlights the talents or lack thereof of many Hollywood larvae including the Sandler clan, Patrick Schwarzenegger, and Paulina Gretzky. Team Jacob fans can watch Taylor Lautner in an uncredited role as Fratboy Andy. My how they have fallen.

Will work as a rental. No hurry to rush out and see it.

Parental Guide: Brief male rear nudity. 1 f-bomb. No sex. Sex talk and general crudeness including urination, feces, and fart humor. Razzy nomination.",1374883200,,877,4.681818181818182
5214596,3,B0090SI55A,"So, Adam Sandler has never made a sequel?  How is that possible?  If you really think about it, that interesting tidbit makes perfect sense.  What would be the point of making 50 First Dates 2, The Wedding Singer 2, Just Go with It 2, or Happy Gilmore 2 (even though that would have been a massively successful sequel)?  It doesn't appear that Sandler has purposely avoided making a sequel, he's just one of those ""one and done"" actors that never reprises his previous roles, despite heavily criticism for many of them (although, it's hard to imagine criticism keeps him up at night).  It's no secret critics have been pretty harsh on the ""King of the Razzie.""  The response to the majority of his films has been pretty sub-par over recent years (okay, that was being nice - it has really been downright terrible).  Regardless, Sandler has very few box office bombs under his belt over the course of his lengthy career, and those that did end up in the red were easily replenished by his successful flicks, including Grown Ups, which raked in an impressive $271 million in 2010.  And, with that being said - it's no surprise the stars of Grown Ups are back for a sequel, cleverly titled, Grown Ups 2.

Directed by Dennis Dugan (Grown Ups, Happy Gilmore, Just Go with It), Grown Ups 2 stars Adam Sandler who reprises his role as Lenny Feder, a Hollywood talent agent.  After living the Hollywood lifestyle, Lenny moved his family back to his suburban roots, once again living near his best friends - Eric (Kevin James), Kurt (Chris Rock), and Marcus (David Spade).  For their kids, it's the last day of school before summer is out, and for the adults, it's just another day in the neighborhood.  But, why not start the summer off right - with a party?  However, before the party can begin, Lenny, along with his friends and family, have plenty to do - like attend a dance recital, reminisce about some childhood memories, and face-off against a bunch of chest-bumping frat guys.  Salma Hayek, Steve Buscemi, Taylor Lauter, and Shaquille O'Neal also star in supporting roles.

There's no need to dance around the major issue of this film:  there's absolutely no point to it whatsoever.  From beginning to end, this film is quite simply a reason for Adam Sandler to get all of his friends together to make a cheesy movie and get paid to do it.  Sure, some people will criticize the fact that this film is lazy and lacks ambition, but at the same time, most Adam Sandler flicks are full of pointless nonsense.  It would be too easy to tear this film apart, pointing out its endless amount of flaws, but so many comedies out there these days lack purpose, often sacrificing plot for cheap laughs - and that's exactly the point.  Even though this film, much like its predecessor, leaves a great deal to be desired in the plot department (not to mention character development), the film still features a great deal of entertainment value.  If you don't' believe me, just ask yourself the simple question:  If Adam Sandler movies are so bad, why do so many moviegoers continue to pay to see them?  The simple answer is they're funny...and Grown Ups 2 is no exception.

Once again, the main cast is back - including Kevin James, Chris Rock, and David Spade.  Their shenanigans are endless and the childish pranks continue on from the first film, spending plenty of time passing gas, wiping off deer pee (yeah, you read that right), and ribbing each other's shortcomings.  Some scenes are funnier than others, with one of the best being an uninflated river raft incident, and the stalest being the opening scene where a deer invades the Feder household.  Still, the laughs will be pretty consistent throughout.  Oddly enough, the majority of the ""funniest"" moments involve Shaquille O'Neal, who portrays a laid-back police officer.  And, if you're a fan of previous Adam Sandler flicks, then you'll recognize the majority of the supporting cast/cameos, which includes Allen Covert, Steve Buscemi, Jon Vovitz, Peter Dante, Dan Patrick, and Nick Sardson.  Missing from the film, however, is Rob Schneider - one of the main cast members from the first film.  Citing another filming obligation as the reason for his absence, Nick Sardson fills in as a new character, even though his character clearly was written for Schneider, which often resembles Schneider's characteristics from Grown Ups.

In the event that you're on the fence about seeing Grown Ups 2, there's a simple rule of thumb:  if you enjoyed Grown Ups, there's no reason to assume you won't enjoy this sequel.  The film features a quality cast, a ton of laughs, and the content is kept relatively clean (despite the constant abuse of female cleavage) with a PG-13 rating.  At the same time, if you watched Grown Ups and found it to be tedious to sit through, there's really no need to give this film a shot since very little has changed from the first film.  Grown Ups 2 is targeted towards a younger crowd and movie lovers that have followed Sandler or any one of his cast mates throughout their careers.  By now you should already know how you feel about the majority of the cast featured in this film.  Their brand of comedy can be a bit crude at times, but for the most part, it's innocent, wholesome fun for the entire family.  In any event, the diehard Adam Sandler fans out there probably already have their plans to see the film - and they won't be disappointed with the outcome of this film.  As far as everyone else goes, determining whether or not to see this sequel is a coin-flip and should depend on your ""kind"" of humor.

5215018,5,B0090SI55A,"Great art-house film, Grown ups 2 is Adam Sandlars satire on on the complications of the 21st century's subversive modifications on the natural neural process effecting social mechanics in an urban an environment. This film may be a little to high-brow/ artsy for some, but those who are willing to put some thought into the events of this film will find themselves enthralled with a wit and subtly rarely found in modern entertainment. my final critique is this: Grown Ups 2 challenges the innately normative nature of Hollywood and its commitment to this sphere of reality which is (as we all know) in and of itself, a falsity and an illusion created by Hitler to force us into a deregulated state of being in which we are only concerned with the tangible objects we call ""science"" and ""humanity"". ""Grown Ups 2"" strives to shatter reality as we know it, entirely. The chaos that unfolds on screen both on a narrative, and a character level can only be summed up as anti-reality. ""Grown Ups 2"" finds a masterful balance between realism, and formalism, often blending avant-garde, unconventional character arcs with the predictable cinematography and humor we've come to expect: completely subverting our expectations. The film forces you into a state of mind where reality is no longer relevant. You exist in a plane of darkness, with only the film by your side. Its harsh criticisms of traditional comedy, mixed with its surrealist approach to character development, ""Grown Ups 2"" redefines what a film should be, and foreshadows what it truly can be.",1491091200,3,1553,4.954022988505747

The humor is immature, dated, corny, and tired. (Are we really still supposed to laugh at poop and fart jokes and Chia Pet references? Paging 1989!) Plus, it's downright sexist at times (not to mention unoriginal, as in the case of the harried mom of a toddler who has to look down his diaper to see how ""bad"" his #2 is).

It's such a waste, considering the rapport of the stars. Sandler and his buddies really do have great chemistry, which means Grown Ups 2 isn't a total waste of time. (The other bright spot? Seeing Taylor Lautner overplay as the villain.) But it's too bad they aren't working with better material.",1471824000,,815,4.54421768707483

He not only brought the magic back but he went all Merlin on the elements of comedy and skyrocketed it to a new outrageous and hilarious level.  If you liked the first Grown Ups, (bare in mind I said liked) then you will LOVE the sequel.  The first film had some heart warming moments that were kind of tender, and might make some guys question their masculinity.  LOL.  This film leaves your masculinity in tack and your nuts feeling bruised a little. Watch the film to figure that one out.

The gang from Grown Ups 2 returns for an epic adventure of proving you're never too old to party like a rock star.  There are moments that show the importance of family and not in one of those sappy cheesy 7th Heaven kind of ways (although I love that show.).  Grown Ups 2 shows that you can have tender family moments while going balls to the wall crazy with the shenanigans.

Rent, Stream, or Buy.  You'll be glad you did. I love this film.  If you're having a crazy week at work, this film is PERFECT to drag you out of any funk, even if it's uptown funk.",1455667200,3,1191,4.267857142857143

5217045,2,B0090SI55A,"After seeing the first film Grown Ups produced by Adam Sandler and directed by Dennis Dugan, there were so many high expectations for Grown Ups 2. Everyone wants the sequel of their favorite films to be better, but Grown Ups 2 is far from it. Maybe it was because there was such high expectations, or maybe the movie was that bad due to the plot being horribly structured, the sloppy acting, and the whole movie being just so unrealistic.
 This movie takes place in the town of where the four main characters grew up. Lenny Feder (Adam Sandler) decided to move his wife (Salma Hayek) and children back to the town he grew up in.  The movie takes place on the last day of school and follows the adventures of Lenny, Eric Lamonsoff (Kevin James), Kurt McKenzi (Chris Rock), and Higgens (David Spade) throughout their day. The four men find themselves in trouble more than once while planning an end of the year party at the Feder residence.
 The plot of the film was appallingly structured and hard to follow. The transitions were not only choppy, but abrupt as well. Since the movie is following the life of the four main families, the director focuses too much on the time spent apart and should have focused more on the families together. For example, the movie starts at the Feder (Sandler, Hayek) residence and half way through the scenes the film is switched to the Lamonsoff residence (James and Maria Bello). The transitions made the scenes feel incomplete, and hard to follow. Since the plot was so difficult to understand, it forced the viewer to have to think through the plot in order to truly understand the film as a whole. As a viewer, I am watching this film for entertainment. I do not want to spend my time thinking what just happened?
 I know that the movie is supposed to be a comedy, but I spent more time laughing at the acting skills then at the actual movie itself. Considering how many well known actors are in this film, I was expecting more from the cast than what was portrayed. Many of the lousy acting points in this film came from the younger actors. When it came to the scene in the quarry with Andre (Nadji Jeter), Braden (Alex Ludwig), and Greg (Jake Goldberg), the acting was awful. They tried to speak in this fake accent that was unbearable to listen to because it wasn't even an accent. The lines in the movie were not delivered with the same one liner killers as the first film, which made the acting overall that much worse.
 The whole movie takes place in the course of the last day of school, but it is impossible for all the events to take place in the amount of time elated. This made the characters seem like they were in two places at the same time which would have been physically impossible. I realize that the movie is fiction and in order to make a movie, not everything is going to be realistic, but the movie was so unrealistic that it was so hard to comprehend.
 With this many flaws in one film, I don't understand why any one person would want to waste 1 hour and 41 minutes of their life on this one film. It doesn't help this film that the prequel  was just so strong, and this one is less than mediocre. Grown Ups 2 should have never existed, hasn't the director ever heard of  stop while you are ahead.",1443916800,,3259,4.447236180904523

3. It was cute and amusing.

This is not a comedy to re-write comedies. This was a really simple, fun movie. It's best for someone in the mood for a movie like this. Akin to a light drinker, it's the 2nd glass of wine or the 2nd beer. You're already ready predisposed to bubbliness, the little bit of extra juice carries you there. You don't need it, but it's fun.

But bought this only so that I could understand the ""Worst Idea of All Time"" podcast--52 weeks of two young men from New Zealand commenting on this dreadful movie. I got about 10 minutes into this piece of dreck. Then I realized that the podcast is enjoyable and makes perfect sense even if you haven't seen the movie. The podcast is great, so I'm recommending it. The first ten minutes of the movie are dreadful. I stopped watching at the point when a toddler does a bouncy, ""my diaper is full"" dance. Mom changes the diaper. Oh, how romantic: it's not poopy. Her husband has hidden a present in it. How lucky that the kid didn't poop all over it before she got to it, huh?",1427760000,,728,4.440298507462686

5218867,3,B0090SI55A,"Grown Ups 2
 This sequel to Grown Ups (2010) is just exactly what you might expect.  The director, Dennis Dugan, also directed Grown Ups and also the seminal Adam Sandler movie, Happy Gilmore.  Sandler has been resting on his Happy Gilmore success for more than a decade now and Grown Ups 2 does not change his direction.  Grown Ups 2 is not so much a movie as we think of a movie but rather a series of comedy sketches involving the same set of characters.
 The story line is that the four amigos from Grown Ups are now all living in the small town where they grew up.  They want their own children to have the same experience of small town virtues that they had.  Well, as we might foresee, stuff happens, and fortunately a lot of the stuff is pretty funny.  On the other hand, there is a lot of stuff that remains just stuff.  The writing is very uneven and we bounce from funny bits to bits that are at best flat.
 Sandler likes to bring in his old pals to enliven his films, or to feed at his trough if you will.  His co-stars are Kevin James, Chris Rock and David Spade, all from the former film.  They are as far from their historic best in Grown Ups 2 as is Adam Sandler himself.  This is not nearly as bad as Sandlers recent Jack and Jill where he played a brother and sister.  It is more in the low end of the three saw blade range.  It is funny in places and not offensive or terrible.
 Also featured in Grown Ups 2 are many of his friends including Steve Buscemi, Tim Meadows (WKRP Cincinnati) and Saturday Night Live alumni Jon Levitz and Colin Quinn.  Basketball great Shaquille ONeal and professional wrestling legend Stone Cold Steve Austin also have supporting roles.  Selma Hayek and Maya Rudolph play two of the wives of the four pals.
 Adam Sandler made a lot of movies which people paid good money to see.  That is all we ask of Hollywood.  Make movies that people want to see.  He made us smile often and occasionally he made us laugh.  Once in a while, he even made us stop and think about ourselves and the big world.  The infinite patience his character showed in 50 First Dates comes to mind.  I think of him sometimes when my patience wears thin and it helps me.
 Grown Ups 2 will make fans smile and it keeps us out of the summer heat for one hour and 41 minutes.  This inoffensive, unspectacular comedy is rated a tame PG-13.  Is it scant praise to simply say, Its a pretty good Adam Sandler film?",1414108800,,2426,4.2725274725274724

5219291,3,B0090SI55A,"Grown Ups 2 falls victim to the dreaded sequel problem. The first one was better than most anticipated. After all the hype, it is hard to hold that standard into a second movie. That was clearly the case here.

The overall plot line was decent enough. It shows a somewhat normal day in the life of these grown up adolescents. There's the uber successful Sandler, the cable installer (Rock), a roofer/handyman (James), and the loser-y Spade, the only single one of the bunch.

The film revolves around the last day of school for their children and an impromptu ""80's party"" at Sandler's mansion. It is a story of accepting the harsh realities of aging while not giving into them.

There were parts I liked about the movie and some I did not.

The star list on the film is nothing short of incredible. There were so many former SNL members it was crazy! But the cameos didn't stop there. Shaq, Taylor Lautner, Steve Buschemi, ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, and I'm sure more people that I didn't even notice. There was no shortage of big name stars.

For a movie in the comedy genre, it wasn't all that funny. In fact, I felt like a lot of it missed the target completely. The philosophy for parts of this movie were to repeat something for a long period of time, which would eventually cause the audience to laugh. Sadly, if it wasn't after the first few seconds, doing it again and again didn't help much.

With all the comedic talent associated with this, it should have been much better.

Nick Swardson's character was completely unnecessary. He wasn't funny in the least with his drug/pill induced stupor at the beginning or walking around with soiled underwear at the end. In fact, when I first saw him (Nick) open the door of the school bus, I couldn't help but think of Chris Farley and how it would have been the perfect role for him. I think he might have been the bus driver in Wayne's World or another SNL production.

Grown Ups 2 was passable, but barely. Maybe I should have rewatched the first one or left it alone. Sadly, I thought like some things this series might get better with time. That was clearly not the case.",1406246400,,2129,4.526041666666667

This one's even more kid friendly than the usual fare, meaning an even wider plethora of nut shots, fart jokes, silly shouting, cornball pop-culture references, and crazy imbeciles. Perhaps sensing this movie is a bit light on actual jokes and more stuffed with general zany stupidity, the film is replete with cameos: Stone Cold Steve Austin dressed as the Terminator, Steve Buscemi getting drunk at a bikini carwash, Shaq with a bad bald wig, Taylor Lautner is sexually assaulted by a deer... None of these things are hilariously hysterical, yet all these kinds of moments still manage to make the viewer smile with their gleefully deranged abandon.

5219491,1,B0090SI55A,"Adam Sandler may be a genius who is making millions in Hollywood.  He has found a way to cast all of his buddies, indulge in his love for 80's nostalgia, and take them on free vacations, all under the guise of making movies, thus writing it off for tax purposes.  Every one of his films within the past decade is clearly evident of this...  They all have the same group of actors (many of whom are in bit parts, but still), and they all seem to be set in some exotic locale.  Way to go Sandler...

Yet Grown Ups 2 was the absolute final straw.  There was a time when yes, I enjoyed Sandler's work.  Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and even Big Daddy are still able to generate solid laughs from me.  Perhaps it's because they were released at a time when I was young and not expecting too much, but in my book, they're comedic classics.

Yet, something happened within Sandler's career.  It's almost as if he discovered that his fan base has low expectations and has since reveled in the fact that he is critic-proof.

Grown Ups 2 could be perhaps one of the laziest films I've ever seen.  It is definitely one of the worst.  But then again, what can you expect from a film that Rob Schneider bowed out of, and the first five minutes consists of a deer urinating in Sandler's face?  Only that's not even part of the plot.  One of the huge problems with the film is that THERE IS NO PLOT.  The plot is non-existent, where each scene is a set up for a joke, which ambles on to the next.  It is Sandler literally hanging out with his buddies and joking around.  I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't even a script...

What plot there is consists of Sandler, Rock, James, and Spade hanging out on what is their kids' last day of school and attempting to throw a huge 80's-themed bash (80's reference, check!), while avoiding the new bullies in town -- college frat kids whose definition of cool doesn't gel with Sandler and company's lifestyle.  And that's about it...  There are scenes that linger at a gym for the main character's wives, a scene where the four comedians walk through a K-Mar for no apparent reason at all, and bounds of toilet humor.

What's also disconcerting is how the film seems to tout an anti-bullying message, when the main characters consciously do just that throughout the entire film.  So who are the real bullies here?

In the end, if you're familiar with Sandler's work, then you know what you're getting into, but for the love of God, who are these films for?  Clearly not adults...  Some would say adolescents and pre-teens, yet there is no way they will relate to the adult-bonding scenes and 80's references.  While his films do make money, they're lazy.  JUST GO WITH IT, JACK & JILL, and now this, are studies in bad.  I don't know the direction that Sandler should take his career...  But if he was a regular Joe and not a Hollywood actor, this feels like the equivalent of punching a time clock and playing Tetris for eight hours...  Avoid at all costs.",1401062400,,2988,4.4575645756457565

1. Line at the DMV
2. Waiting for Comcasts 6 hour appointment window
3. Watching talented comedians make a horrible sequel.  ****

Watching this movie ranked in the top 3.

Wow were to start.

Firstly ...  I would love an excuse to hire my friends, and turn our 6 week party into a major motion picture. But at $10-14 dollars a theater ticket I would be too guilt ridden to force my diabolical plan on an unsuspecting viewing public.
Quite simply Adam Sandler should be ashamed to have made this movie or it should have come with some sort of disclaimer mentioning it would be sole crushing waste of your time.

The cast has talent ... Tons of talent!! Unfortunately the script doesn't account for any. It was just a jumbled mess of juvenile jokes that leave the audience wondering how they could ever face a homeless person again and not think the money that was spent for this film could have somehow been put to better use.

I love a good comedy. Tommy Boy is one of my favorites - but what made it funny to me was liking and then relating to the characters. In Grownups 2.

No-one is really likable and although it targets the 80s which is wonderful ... I could not find myself relating to anything but the stop button on the remote, I watched the whole movie the way a child would be forced to eat broccoli.

You could tell they were making up jokes on the spot cause they were on the level of a 5th grader. Like the cop popping up out of the blue and getting car washed with Shaq as they dance naked. If this sounds hilarious to you, then rent it. The 80's style party near the end finale was a fun idea but not enough to save GU2. I also hate the DVD cover.",1392163200,,471,3.816326530612245

5220079,5,B0090SI55A,I have a HUGE DVD collection and I am happy to add this film to that collection.  I already had the sequel to this film.,1391731200,,120,3.8
5220080,1,B0090SI55A,"While the first Grown Ups movie was surprisingly funny and intelligent, this successor just sucked big time.
My wife and I were expecting the same kind of entertainment we got in the first movie. But instead we got maybe three good laughs out of the entire time (the only one I can remember were the cliff jumps). Had we seen any trailers before watching this movie, those would have been probably spoiled too by then.

If you like gags about farting or burping, you also might like the rest of the jokes, because they are on the same intellectual level.

There is hardly a single gag in the movie, you haven't already seen somehow in one of the the Naked Gun, Mike Myers', Police Academy or any similar movies of this category. But this time executed worse. Unless you consider it funny to see an animated deer piss somebody in the face, a group of frat boys pretend to engage in a punchfest with the familes and friends of the four protagonists of the first movie (yes, only four, not five!) or every member of one family saying ""whaaaaat?"" in a weird way when it is totally mistimed. Sometimes the jokes are so shallow that is even embarrassing to have to watch them play out. And every 5 minutes you get to see a 16 year old staring at some older hot chicks, hugging some drunken college chick or eyeballing the dcollet of a woman. While I like to see attractive girls in a movie, it escapes me, how that is supposed to be so funny that is has to be repeated at any opportunity. Not to mention the frat boys exercising a handshake for so long, that it starts to hurt having to watch it. I was really glad that the director at least seemed to have noticed that little detail by himself and cut the handshake short when the frat boys started it when they showed up the 2nd time.

So my advise: don't waste your money on this cheap piece of crap trying to ride on the success of the first part. Unless you are below the age of 14 and without access to the internet. Then you'll probably be grateful for the opportunity to get to see a few hot girls in Bikinis and some run-of-the-mill Hollywood comedy jokes for the first time.",1391644800,,2128,4.355163727959698

Where Grown Ups 1 was geared more towards kids and being a family friendly movie, Grown Ups 2 has all the gross out humor and weird funny moments you found in those 90's Sandler greats of yore!  I've been waiting for years for Sandler to get back on the Crazy Train and he finally has in this movie.  The breakout star of the movie that has the funniest moments is Nick Swardson surprisingly!  I haven't cracked up this hard at a Adam Sandler movie since Chris Farley was alive!

As a movie, its a train wreck. A classic case of too many chefs in the kitchen. Storyline is also pretty much nonexistent. But as I sat there, I started watching it from the perspective of an all-star SNL short skit mash-up and it was pretty funny, especially the car wash scene.

None of the story lines from the original movie carried over. (i.e. all the characters and their families now live in the town where the men grew up but it does not explain why; why did Sandler and Hayek's characters leave their high paying jobs, mansion and nanny?) The original movie had a well-developed central theme relating to family struggles and conflict, presented in a hilarious manner. This movie literally has NO PLOT. Not only did the story lines from the original movie disappear, there are no new story lines introduced; it was just one random scene after another. it wasn't even funny (I laughed maybe 4 times in 1hr 41min... not much considering this is supposed to be a comedy).

David Spade lost his hilarity back when Chris Farley died.

Adam Sandler has the ability to have polarizing story telling - 50 First Dates was cute, Bed Time Stories was fun for my kids/family... this one is one that could be left alone and you'll have saved yourself time (that otherwise you'd never get back) ...all reported by my wife.

PS  Adam Sandler isn't alone, Jack Black has the same issue (Nacho Libre and Kung Fu Panda were great) and so does Steve Carell is another (anyone see Dan in Real Life and Despicable Me??)...

5221158,3,B0090SI55A,"First off, I'm not much of an Adam Sandler fan, but I did find the first one of this series suprisingly enjoyable. Both movies are a classic Adam Sandler movies, just with a different plot line and some new characters. There's still plenty over the top situations with some crude elements, but still borderlines as family friendly. Still a lot of bad acting and jokes that kids won't get, but plenty that kids will and still has a little something for everyone. Believe it or not, the story, plot-line, and scenes of the first one were actually close to the realm of possiblity than a typical Adam Sandler movie.

Second, while the first was in the realm of reality, the second one isn't. It basically starts a year later after all of the families decided to move back to their home town (Except for Rob Schneider's character...not sure what happened there). It's the last day of school for all their kids and the Dad's are having more fun reconnecting with their youth than the actual children. From the onset, the situations and story is just way crazy, but there are some pretty funny moments. Lot's of sappy, as well as, crude humor situations. Of course, a ton of celebrity guest appearences (Shaq Diesal, The Wolf Guy from Twilight, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Andy Sandberg, etc.). The story includes a significant part dedicated to a local fraternity of a-holes, which honestly are the highlights of the movie. Of course, the story and situations just get crazier as the movie goes on and as usual with Sandler movies...there's a sappy happy ending to wrap up everything.

All in all, I (personally) was a little disapointed because I thought the story would be a tad bit more realistic, but in the end I knew better and it ended up being classic Adam Sandler. Decent if you can rent for a few bucks or for free, but not one to recommend to anyone who isn't a Sandler fan.",1388361600,,1877,4.616766467065868

5221209,1,B0090SI55A,This movie is terrible. Not even close to as funny as the first. The storyline was okay but the writers tried too hard to be funny.

So when the 2nd movie came out, we nearly went to see it at the theater.. So glad we did not. We just watched it and it could possible be a contender for the worst movie ever.

  I don't get it. Wtf happened?  Happy Madison production used to mean it's going to b really funny, no doubt. Grown ups 2 is so cheesy & lame, I can't even enjoy the tiny bits of humor mixed in w/ the hoards of garbage. What a disappointment! This movie is atrocious from the very moment it begins. I feel like I'm watching the worst, cheesy kids movie, only it's not for kids.  It's so bad, even an actor who has fallen on hard times financially should pass it up, yet greats like Steve Buschemi still took the role!

5221532,1,B0090SI55A,"When I put this DVD in my DVD player and pressed Play, it just went through an hour and forty-three minutes of deleted scenes.  (Ba-dum-bum)  But seriously, folks, if you've ever wondered what it would be like to watch a movie almost entirely composed of deleted scenes that shouldn't go into the special features (let alone, the final script), you can stop wondering, because Grown Ups 2 is just that.  If you haven't seen the first Grown Ups, watch that one and forget this sequel ever existed.  If you did see the first Grown Ups and expect a coherent follow-up in the sequel, you're in for a big disappointment.

Grown Ups 2 is a continuous sequence of mostly-lame gags, though there were a few genuinely funny parts that did did make us laugh.  There are no deleted scenes in the special features, because if they had deleted everything that should have been deleted, they would have only had enough material left to make a 3-5 minute webisode around each of the handful of funny bits.  There were two or three times in the last half hour where I thought they were finally setting up a big, incredible adventure, but it never materialized.  I guess I was okay with that, because the movie was already dragging on forever and starting the adventure at that point would have made it even longer.

SPOILER ALERT
=============
The premise of Grown Ups 2 is that all four guys (three of whom are married with kids) have moved back to the hometown where they grew up, and now on the last day of school they're collectively having another mid-life crisis.  David Spade's character is set up as the worst off, having a teenage punk kid visiting from out of town--a son which the all-but-forgotten mother only told him about over the phone a couple days prior.  Supposedly the kid is in high school, but he looks like he's in his twenties.  Spade's character tries makes some wisecracks in an attempt to bond.  The kid obviously doesn't like him from the start but is willing to give him a chance.

The four friends go back to their old hang-out spot so one of the guys can jump off a cliff into a lake (something which he always managed to find an excuse not to do back when they were  young) and finally earn his man card.  But there are a bunch of college kids hanging out at the lake, and up on the cliff the four grown-up male friends encounter a bunch of stereotypical fraternity jerks.could say the theme of the movie was ""bullies.""  Insults ensue, the four guys get ready to fight, then one of the frat boys makes a cheesy battle cry and an army of frat boys jumps out from behind bushes and rocks, surrounding the four doomed friends.  Frat boys make them jump off the cliff naked one at a time, with the other college party kids watching from the lower level of rocks on the other side of the water.  Kevin James lands on David Spade, who then cries, disgustedly, ""I was inside of you!""

The middle part of the movie is basically a bunch of half-baked attempts at humor, desperately hoping the audience keeps watching until the two big showdowns at the end--it's almost like they didn't have a single professional comedy writer or script writer on the crew.

Near the end, Sandler's character throws a big party.  The first showdown is with the main bully from Sandler's past (bully played by none other than Stone Cold Steve Austin).  This part is pretty much the one good bit of writing in the entire movie.  Sandler wants to teach his son how to be a man and stand up to bullies.  Upon hearing this, Austin's character (who has been a huge jerk the entire movie) can finally relate to Sandler and immediately hatches a plan--Sandler can punch him, and he'll go down like a sack of bricks.  The plan changes a bit as the two chat in their boxing poses, and eventually Stone Cold is cowering and pleading for mercy.  Sandler continues his trash talk to milk the situation for all it's worth, and then some.  After that situation is resolved, the frat boys show up for revenge because someone previously trashed their frat house and they assume it's the four Grown Ups whom they shamed earlier at the lake.  (As it turns out, Spade's son was the one who vandalized the frat house, but  nobody cares at this point.)  Everyone gets in a big fight which the ""townies"" eventually win, a little later there are some warm fuzzy moments, and finally the credits roll.",1386115200,,4366,4.530612244897959

5221619,1,B0090SI55A,"There was just no plot.

This movie picks up a couple of years after Grown Ups. Adam Sandler has moved back to his hometown, and everyone has welcomed him back with open arms. Sort of.

We open with a moose, or a deer... some kind of antlered creature is in his bedroom. He wakes up, wakes his wife up, she screams, the deer pees in his mouth. Sure. We spend several minutes trying to get the deer out of the house, and it destroys many things in the process. Don't worry... we will spend zero minutes dealing with the deer destruction... it is forgotten by act two.

Adam hijacks the bus from a strung out driver... instead of reporting someone who does drugs and drives kids around.... and goes to pick up all of his friends. Cause no one has a job here. They cavort and play and carry on about town, starting confrontations, making poop jokes, and various other hijinks.

The whole thing ends with an 80's themed party that was planned about 30 minutes into the movie. It is incredible that with absolutely zero warning or planning, this party with a full band and catering comes off without a hitch... including appropriate and incredible costumes for everyone. EVERYONE in town is there! Even people that Adam Sandler and his friends have been making fun of, confronting, and arguing with all day! Yep... I always go pick a fight, then decide to throw a party on the way home, and invite my enemies.

It appeared to be an excuse for a group of friends, who also happen to be comedians, to get together one more time to make a movie.

I am sure with their personalities there would have been a lot of improv while filming. Honestly, I think that a bloopers movie of all of the mistakes or other takes would have possibly been more entertaining than this movie.

It was a very choppy film, so if you are looking for family entertainment, you might want to try something else. However, if you are just looking forward to laughing and would like to reminisce about the SNL days of the 90's, this is a great choice.

5221746,2,B0090SI55A,"The original ""Grown Ups"" was a surprisingly deft and endearing comedy that at least managed to squeeze a modicum of quality out of its formulaic tale of four childlike buddies having trouble adjusting to the obligations and responsibilities that come with middle age. The movie somehow managed to balance the requisite gross-out gags with some genuinely thoughtful and sophisticated humor about the compromises that come with growing up. The sequel, imaginatively named ""Grown Ups 2,"" is something else again, a movie that's every bit as epicene, juvenile and dumbed-down as one would have expected the original to be. Suffice it to say that any movie that starts off with a deer urinating on an unsuspecting suburban family has set a pretty low bar for itself. And ""Grown Ups 2"" lives down to those expectations just about every step of the way.

The original had at least a semblance of a plot on which to hang its jokes, namely the men's coming together for a memorial service for their junior high school basketball coach who had recently died. Here the script is nothing more than a loosely strung-together series of misadventures as the ""boys"" roam around town getting into all sorts of mischief, some unlooked-for and some a product of their own making.

As with any movie that employs three comedy writers - Adam Sandler, Tim Herlihy and Fred Wolf - to hash out the screenplay, there will inevitably be a few genuinely funny moments scattered throughout the film, but they are not enough to counter the barrage of urine, poop and vomit jokes that receive a much higher percentage of the screen time.

The movie wastes a quality cast that includes Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Selma Hayek, Maya Rudolph, Steve Buscemi, Georgia Engel and Taylor Lautner.

5221873,1,B0090SI55A,"Warning. Spoilers ahead.

With several big names in comedy that you probably recognize, you might go into this movie thinking how could it go wrong. In fact, if you're much of a fan of comedies at all, or even have a passing interest, you've probably seen the work of one or all of these guys before. For any of them, their movies have been hit or miss over the years, but you could generally find something that amused or entertained you. This time, its misses all around as this film fails on many levels.

In one aspect, this film falls flat on its paper thin plot. Now, of course, you probably don't expect that a comedy of this irk would feature a richly intricate and layered plot, and that's ok. However, there should at least be enough plot to set the stage for the comedic events or situations we find our characters in. Since you won't find any of that here, what results is a series of scenes strung together with no real direction, no real message, and no real point. Literally, the plot, in summary, is that the four main guys decide to have a big party. They screw around town all day and get into a dispute with some frat guys, who they wind up fighting at the big party. There are a couple of subplots, of course, but nothing you'll really remember or care about tomorrow.

In another aspect, and this is a big one in a comedy movie, the humor is very limited. You'll probably find a few scenes or one-liners worth a chuckle, but by and large I just didn't feel like it was there. For example, the opening sequence involves a deer that is inexplicably in the Sandler character's house. He startles it and it begins to pee all over members of the family. To me, this scene was more of a head scratcher than it was funny. Thrown in too are some fart jokes, some gay jokes, and some physical slapstick, all of which come across as generally tired and humorless.

The first Grown Ups, as I vaguely remember, was a story of friends reuniting, and ultimately their desire to go back to simpler life that they once knew, and the hometown they realized they still loved. Point is, there was at least some sort of message, a central theme, to the first movie. All of that is absent here, so the only point to the film seems to be just to get to the end. There is little or no development to the characters, and no conclusion to their stories. In the end, who cares.

One last criticism I might offer, which is strange for this sort of film, is that some of the CGI sequences just look terrible and very low budget.

If you're into throwaway, forgettable comedies, you're not alone. I'm with you. However, I would advise you not to waste your time on this one. The market for this type of movie is oversaturated, so there are much better options for you out there. If you absolutely feel compelled to see this movie, get it cheap from RedBox or something. Otherwise,you won't have to look too hard to find a better one than this.",1384819200,,2935,4.376146788990826

So maybe because I realized that early on it made the movie more enjoyable for me? I don't know but a lot people seemed to have wanted more of a heartfelt story line.
I laughed out loud to this movie and so did most of the movie theater.

90% of the movie is ridiculous and funny and like the last 10 minutes or so it's like they tried to add a heartful message.

It's also more raunchy and tries to get the kids in on more adult jokes -which I don't mind - but it was all really forced. And the jokes were awful.

The overall premise was there - family is what matters - but this movie disappoints many reviewers since the movie is filled with sketches that don't mesh with one another or drive the story line.  Yet, I thought the sketches were funny and odd, in a good way.  I'm going on a limb here, but I thought this movie's humor was the closest to a Billy Madison like humor that I've seen from an Adam Sandler movie in years.

I didn't care for the first Grown Ups or Adam Sandler's later movies - basically, the last 13 years worth - but I liked this one enough to check out buying the DVD.  For this movie, I thought the actors were talented enough in their delivery and ad-libs during their scenes and this helped keep my attention.

For poorish to mid-range Adam Sandler movies, I found this one to be more enjoyable than Jack and Jill, Just Go with It, and That's My Boy.  If your on the fence, just wait for HBO or FX, but I watch all Sandler movies as an Old School fan and will tolerate wasted money on his Genre of movies.",1384387200,,1128,4.267605633802817

Grown Ups 2 is only a little funny and it's not as believable as the first.  If you like Adam Sandler you'll like this movie.  Rob Schneider's character doesn't return which changes the dynamics between the lead characters.

This is exactly what it sets out to be an incredible stupid but very funny movie.  I am not going to compare it to the first, since even though it roughly had the same people it is a different movie with a different theme.  It may have been a bit vulgar at times but really, people talking about the sexual references, have you seen Billy Madison?

There are many funny moments, the raft scenes I laughed so hard... it was crude but that is what I expected.

Even Shaq played a good character.  If you want an evening of crude humor and good laughs then this movie will not disappoint. If you want something much more serious then you should not be watching an Adam Sandler movie.

5222463,3,B0090SI55A,"I was honestly disappointed with this move. While it contains the usual stupid Sandler humor, it fell short to deliver any good laughs. The humor seemed forced and uncomfortable. Of course it was far fetched like all the Sandler movies but I can usually get a few good laughs out of them. This movie, not so much.

I had a problem with the fact that they try to keep the rating at PG13 when clearly it should be more along the lines of R to make a good portion of lines in the move actually funny. Enraged frat house president Taylor Lautner is saying that they are going to ""kill"" the adults but instead of saying ""we're going to f-ing kill them"" he uses ""freaking"" in place of the swear word. As if the F word is truly any worse than saying they are going to kill people? Or better yet that a frat boy would actually even consider ""freaking"" over the F word? Come on now! That's just outright stupid. Use the F word and move the rating up. I could name about twenty other times where a swear would have been better comedy but was not used to preserve the PG13 rating. This just gets under my skin. Yes, I use swears and do not find them offensive. If you dislike swearing then this might be OK for you.

Another problem is the sexual innuendo, I personally do not have a problem with this [at all] but if I were watching it with my 13 year old it would have made me uncomfortable. Why throw in T&A everywhere, dick jokes, naked jokes, masturbation jokes but withhold the swearing? Very annoying.

So yes, watch it with your 13 year old and you don't have to worry about swearing but there are plenty of half naked female cheerleaders, thrusting soapy males ones in booty shorts, and half naked drunk college girls offering minors alcohol. The battle between too much sexual innuendo and no swearing for PG13 just killed it. Together they would have been fine with a higher rating.

Overall, it was OK. I didn't want to break anything after watching it due to wasting my time. There ARE movies that make me want to put my remote through the TV.",1384214400,,2045,4.359580052493438

OK, maybe that was a slight exaggeration. But then again, to call this movie BAD would be the opposite of an exaggeration. To call this movie an insult to humanity would be an understatement. To say that Grown Ups 2 was a mind-numbingly stupid, unfunny, idiotic, unredeemable crapfest would only cover it by about 34.2 percent. To say that Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, and David Spade have not one ounce of comedy material left in their bones, however, is sadly true.

Let me be clear on one thing: Grown Ups 2 is NOT. FUNNY. It's NOT. GOOD, either. It's not funny if you like smart humour. It's not funny if you like dumb humour. It's not funny if you want to relax with your family, watch a stupid movie, watch a gross movie, or even watch a bad movie. It will come up short on EVERY. LEVEL. Trust it from the poor audiences who were duped into losing two hours of their life that could have been spent less painfully using a ballpoint pen to gouge out their own eyes.

To actually think back to the time I watched this (or at least until I walked out), causes my brain cells to have post-traumatic stress. But I soldier on for the good of the populace - to save them from a fate like mine. Grown Ups 2 is stupid, disgusting, boring, unfunny, unredeemably bad, bottom-of-the-barrel-scraping piece of utter, unmissable, trash.

Very little comedic or creative thought has gone into this. The bigger disappointment is that Sandler's Happy Madison productions actually lined up a cast of decent name actors including Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, Paul Blart, Taylor Lautner and Steve Buscemi.  The only reason why I was able to watch it was that these were somewhat known and likeable actors, and was probably a lure to the box office.  But lame jokes and execution plagues this.  The main talent that the stars needed was the ability to see how bad this was a mile away...unfortunately someone kept saying yes.

Not saying the film is bad.  It was worth watching.  Like the first, you can tell the guys know each other, in real life, and that connection bleeds through in their performances.  Such connections tend to strengthen films, especially comedies, and this was no different.  But, this sequel seems to be missing something that was in the first.  It came off less funny, less entertaining.  The humor was there, but less frequent and not as fun as it was in the first Grown Ups.  Some of the mechanics didn't seem to mesh with the rest of the film at all, such as David Spade having a kid... it just didn't seem to land, or work with the rest of the story.

Rather than being a typical movie as such, ""Grown ups 2"" is a dizzying array of many, oh so many skits and sub-plots. Adam Sandler likes to have a lot of oddballs in his movie, and, for sure, he's arranged an absolute army of oddballs on this one.

There is not any particular story or sub-plot that is given any meaning of depth, but rather given about 20-30 seconds of screen time before moving onto another one. The whole thing culminates into a big party where Sandler has his favourite 80's songs as a soundtrack and you can guess something extravagant might happen...

Not that Shaq couldn't actually do that!

I am not sure if they set some kind of a record, but the cast listing for this movie is HUGE with a lot of celebrities making cameo appearances, feel free to check out the IMDB page to see the 200 or so cast members listed.  Seeing Victoria's Secret Angel Erin Heatherton dressed up as a cheerleader in the car wash scene was worth the price of admission if you ask me!  Of course Dan Patrick, as a gym teacher with short shorts, climbing the rope in gym class may give you nightmares.  You have been warned.

This is not a movie where you're going to get a big plot or character development.  What you will get is some laughs, some more sophomoric than others.  As someone who enjoys movies like ""Airplane"" and ""Police Academy"" this one was a fun throwback that I believe anyone who likes that kind of humor will enjoy.  If you hate both of those franchises you will probably want to avoid ""Grown Ups 2"" like the plague!",1382140800,10,1492,4.350180505415162

5222742,1,B0090SI55A,"So I went to watch this movie, in the cheapest way possible, out of curiosity of why so many people wanted to see a movie that critics and audiences massacred like few others. Now I fear for the intelligence of the average moviegoer.

Dumb, boring, not funny at all, fond of toilet humor a 8 year old boy would think is beneath him...

And I though the first one, which I watched only because my girlfriend wanted to see it, wasn't actually bad. Not golden comedy but it was actually funny in several moments. What happened? Did Adam Sandler need to pay for a new house really fast or something else? The most unfunny nickel chaser I've seen in years.

If you respect your brain and time watch something more interesting like paint drying.",1378252800,6,739,4.5
5222743,2,B0090SI55A,"Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock and David Spade team-up again for Grown-Ups 2. So of course there's plenty of poop jokes, puke flying everywhere and tons of childish humor. But this time the movie is a little bit more than Sandler just hanging out with his buddies and getting paid for it. The film just jumps from one scene to another with not much of a plot at all, but this Happy Madison film accomplished something neverless, it made me laugh a lot!
  There's tons of bad acting and bad humor, that a director of a bad spoof movie would appreciate but I'm guilty, I actually was into a lot of the movie. Grown-Ups 2 is awful, while actually being some-what entertaining at the same time. I can't say that about most other recent Sandler movies. Still though, I have to ask, why is the talented Steve Buscemi (Boardwalk Empire) in yet another Adam Sandler movie ?",1377043200,3,872,4.512658227848101
5222744,5,B0090SI55A,This movie is hilarious i'm glad that they kept the original cast but to bad that rob schnieder is not in the film. I thought that the first one was better but this one is still good and funny. there is non stop laughs in this film. if you just want to see a funny movie then this is for you. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1376956800,5,348,3.780821917808219
