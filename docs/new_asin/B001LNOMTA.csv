8319201,2,B001LNOMTA,"Not a great print, washed out color and a lot of scratches - which beyond the obvious downgrade in experience, also makes it harder to follow the plot and keep the characters straight.  But it turns out not that great a movie either, from a story construction or technical viewpoint.  Even for eurospy this is a B-movie: in some fights, you can literally see the punches not connect.  Some witty one-liners are interspersed, though it's truly odd how they keep saying ""Die Slowly, You'll Enjoy It More.""  Isn't that what sadistic villains say?  I enjoyed the ending twist, though.

Still, thanks to Sinister for making it available, because it hasn't been released anywhere else!",1326931200,4,679,4.912280701754386
8319202,4,B001LNOMTA,"Here we have the perfect definition of what entails a Euro Spy movie: hero in the James Bond manner; beautiful femme fatale, eccentric megalomaniac villain, and flamboyant fight sequences.  Since this is an Italian/Spanish/German co production , we also have an amazing cast of the most familiar faces in genre cinema of the sixties and its too bad the script and direction by Franz Gottlieb are so lackluster. 'SPY TODAY, DIE TOMORROW' aka 'MISTER DYNAMITE'-1967 resembles a Kommissar X adventure because of actor Brad Harris as its costar and emerges as a routine spy yarn this time starring Lex Barker in his sole spy role as German agent Bob Urban who is sent to locate a missing A-bomb stolen by millionaire villain extroadinaire Bardo Boretti played menacingly by Amadeo Nazzari.  He plans on selling it back to the highest bidder for a mere 1 billion dollars.  The cast is awesome:  the beautiful Maria Perschy as Boretti's mistress and double agent , Eddie Arent as a Q-like character who gives Barker his gadgets, Dieter Eppler, Wolfgang Priess as Barker's boss, Siegfried Rauch, Gustavo Re, Silvia Solar and a clever cameo by Joachim Fuchsberger as an American MP guard who flirts with Pershey.  The film tends to blend the comedic with the sadistic.  Baretti is obsessed with model trains and has them everywhere even in his limo. Women are drawn to Barker like moths to a flame even having one willing to make love to him underneath his Mercedes.  The sadism emerges in the fight scenes as men are consumed by flames, white crosses are spray painted on the backs of double crossing victims, cigarettes being put out in faces culminating in one of Barkers partners being tied to a burning boat and literally exploding into the air.  The music score by Gianni Moretti is nice but never rousing getting kind of strange as you are watching a fight sequence and a romantic theme is heard in the background.  The villain escapes at the end leaving it open for a sequel which never came. Sinister Cinema releases it in a full screen transfer culled from a faded, scratchy 16mm print but the image is clear and the sound is nice.  Great to own till a proper digital release comes along (which may never happen).  All in all, an enjoyable time capsule for a Saturday afternoon.",1305936000,3,2280,4.776081424936387
8319203,3,B001LNOMTA,"I bought this film because Lex Barker was a decent actor & if that cheap producer of the Tarzan films would have read any of the Tarzan novels by ERB (as Lex Barker had done.)
Well we would have seen a really good set of Tarzan films.
So what's the above to do with Lex in ""Spy today, Die tomorrow"" you might wonder?
This film shows you a side that Lex could've played in Tarzan. Lord Greystoke/Tarzan was at one point a French secret service man. Read the ERB books & enjoy the fun & excitement.

""Spy today Die tomorrow"" Shows Lex having fun in this part & teaming up with Brad Harris (who is STILL in top bodybuilding shape.) Is just a nice little romp of a spy flick from the 1960's.
Not an earth shaker but a simple action film with a little charm.",1238371200,6,753,4.157534246575342
