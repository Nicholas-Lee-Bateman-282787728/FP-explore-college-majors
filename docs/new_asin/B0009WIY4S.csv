2327691,5,B0009WIY4S,"If you are trying out step aerobics for the first time, then you NEED this DVD. The instructor does an excellent job of teaching you at a comfortable but sweat-breaking pace. The workout is broken down into 10-minute increments, so you can increase as you get better. Not for anyone who already knows how to step.

5 stars.",1170547200,18,323,4.568965517241379
2327692,5,B0009WIY4S,"I took step aerobics about 10 years ago and was wanting to get back into it.  This DVD is perfect for giving you the basics.  I love Gin Miller's attitude and instructional style.  I think it gives you a good workout, too!  I am a little bit out of shape and will need to stick to this DVD for a while before moving on to anything harder.  I love step aerobics and this DVD is great",1167782400,8,382,3.973684210526316
2327693,5,B0009WIY4S,"Gin Miller is excellent.  She's funny and smart and is a good, effective instructor.  Her manner is so informal and relaxed, that her dvds are easy to follow.  This is a great dvd.

It's geared mainly for beginners - the choreography is basic and low impact, but you are going to work up a sweat.  She explains all the moves really well, so if you are a beginner, you'll know the moves even if you haven't heard them called that before.  You start with basic steps, and by the end of the workout, you will have progressed to full combinations and be a pro.

This is a good length workout - about 40 minutes not including warm up and cool down, but even if you are a step novice, you'll still burn fat and have fun.  Gin knows her stuff and is very motivating without being pushy.",1147219200,61,779,4.2517006802721085
2327694,4,B0009WIY4S,This was just what I needed to help me break in the step I got for christmas!  Easily taught me the steps in one workout.  I will do it only a couple more times and then step up to a more challenging workout though...this doesn't get my heart pumping enough but I would never be able to follow any of my other step workouts without first having done this one!  Great and perfect for first time steppers!,1137542400,20,403,4.207792207792208
2327695,5,B0009WIY4S,"I love this DVD. I'm overweight and a bit klutzy, and was always afraid to try step aerobics.

But this DVD really puts me at my ease. Gin Miller is fantastic. She is so encouraging and friendly, and her directions are so clear, that I really enjoy using this DVD.

What I like best is that different segments are aimed at different levels of exercisers. Right now, the first few segments are all I can do, but as I grow into it and become more fit, I will be able to do the later segments as well. In other words, this DVD is appropriate for all levels and you won't grow out of it!

I have to laugh when Gin Miller encourages the audience because her enthusiasm is charming (""Let's do double step touches, now. Want to??"")",1137024000,92,724,4.2700729927007295
2327696,5,B0009WIY4S,"A tape of this nature is long overdue!  While I am aerobically fit, I was always intimidated in step class, feeling like I have two left feet and struggling to keep up.  This step tape enabled me to learn the basics - at a slow, comfortable speed and in the privacy of my home.  Gin Miller is a wonderful instructor who provides very clear directions, repeats moves until you master them and is very encouraging.  (Who better to teach this than the inventor of step aerobics?)  If you ever wished you could learn stepping, at your speed and minus the embarassment of a class, then this is definitely the tape for you.",1122076800,136,617,4.473214285714286

This is your basic step instructional video, so you won't find anything new here.  Funny, I thought I would whiz right back into it..... NOT!  I was drenched in sweat 25 minutes in.  It's a great intro video to get back into the routines, steps, etc.  And, a good reminder of why I still love Gin Miller!  Dated, but definitely still very much worthwhile.

So I decided to get this video after reading all the ratings.  And let me tell you, it was pitch perfect.  I learned so much and it gave me such confidence.  The funny thing was I started this so I could feel confident in a class setting and now I love just doing step DVDs at home.  So much so between the Step DVDs and the other DVDs I have gotten I have cancelled my gym membership and am consistently working out at home.

She starts off with a slow warm-up that explains all the moves then gradually levels it up.
I love the simplicity of this video and especially how she works in 10 minute increments so you can choose the time-frame that works for you.

I also loved that I didn't have to watch some perky, ultra-skinny chick in a tight-fitting leotard.

The pace during the teaching sections are slow enough to follow while the pace during each of the 10 minute parts are a good medium impact cardio workout.

I have not worked out for a while, but this video makes you sweat and quite honestly at my age I cannot go through the entire DVD yet.  I am taking baby steps back into exercising.  Some people may think this DVD is simplistic, but for beginners it is perfect.

2327779,5,B0009WIY4S,"I bought this as an instant video so that my 13 year old daughter could learn step. It is a great video for learning how to step. As everyone will tell you, this is a very basic step program. There is zero choreography in it. I'm the kind of person who loves all the fancy choreography at the gym - I find it gives me an extra pep in my step so to speak. I didn't think I would like this video, but I do! I love it in fact! Gin's personality is genuine, her cues are clear, and it's a full work out with out anything fancy. If you'd like to rev it up a notch, chances are you know some high impact moves you can easily incorporate into this program, but again, it's not necessary. Using 1 or 2 risers will definitely get your heart rate going. I recommend adding this to your library. You can still get a full workout on days you don't feel like dealing with complicated choreography.",1395792000,5,884,4.115606936416185

If you are overweight and out of shape as I am, you will  love the feature where she stops to ask you how you are doing (endurance wise) with a simple chart that will tell you to stop if too much before going to next level.

2327786,5,B0009WIY4S,"I found this DVD wonderful.  All my life, I have had horrible coordination issues - can't dance, not graceful at all.  Basic step always left me confused and discouraged. I have to say, Gin Miller had me doing those step moves with ease within ten minutes. This video is for people that are really intimidated about starting exercise; perhaps you've been sedentary a long time or have had some illness or injury or for someone like me that really needed the extra instruction. I am very motivated and encouraged by this and it is enough of a workout where I feel good and I feel I can build on this. If you have any exercise background, especially with step, you will find this DVD very boring and not challenging at all. Personally, I needed the basic instruction to really grasp the steps and I really appreciate how she breaks down the moves to where you can really get a handle on things. Gin really knows her audience here. For the absolute beginner, I highly highly recommend this.",1388707200,3,987,4.570621468926554

I was always intimidated going into a step aerobics class because I felt lost and out of sync, and didn't know the terms for the steps.  This DVD is amazing, most because of Gin Miller. She has a warm personality, and is so encouraging you wish she was right there to could give her a hug. It starts from the beginning, and progresses to more challenging levels, and a great workout.  Because of this, I have signed up for a step aerobics class and feel comfortable, but still continue to work out with this video.",1379548800,3,596,4.351351351351352
2327800,5,B0009WIY4S,"In the early 1990s, when StepReebok was all the rage, I had utterly, absolutely no interest in exercise, period. Admittedly, by the mid-1990s, I was in college and had discovered that I loved to go out to the clubs and dance hard, as hard as I could, at which point I was pretty darn fit. Well, those days are long gone and behind me, much as I still love the music, and until Gin's DVD showed up on my doorstep, I will admit to having actively cultivated an anti-fitness, mind-over-matter intellectual persona that has left me with a rather sad legacy of crap posture, mistrust of various joints, and two left feet.

So nearing 40, when I realized I had a nice milestone ahead of me for finally whipping myself back into some reasonable semblance of shape and a burgeoning wish to do so (out of necessity if nothing else), I made the rather random decision to try step for the very first time (without really realizing this was based on my oh-so nineties memory, though I suppose I figured that since I used to love dancing so much, step might work for me). After some extended browsing, I ordered Gin's video. The choice wasn't entirely random, because the reviews seemed rather good, and it was only then that I learned she is considered one of step's primary innovators.

To get to the point? I am thrilled! I really don't care if step is pass or not. Gin Miller has somehow managed to single-handedly addict me to step from the very first day I had the DVD; I've been following it faithfully almost every morning since it arrived, and I'm truly impressed with her abilities to teach and motivate the most cynical among us. She is a born teacher: excellent cues, as sincere as she is self-deprecating, and to top it off, she is the real deal, by which I mean you are not being talked down to, nor are you being misled to believe this particular routine will let you ""shred"" weight or gain muscle at some unrealistic speed. After just two weeks, in any case, I've noticed my mood improving, my energy levels rising, and my general posture becoming vastly more confident (I had major scoliosis surgery as a teenager, another factor that has left me seriously apprehensive about exercise despite my doctor's encouragement).

In any case: If you are a true beginner like I am, after years of not exercising daily, you will without doubt work up a reasonable sweat (add arm movements if you need more burn!) and appreciate Gin's ability to demystify the choreography other instructors rather blithely pass off as ""basic step."" In no time, you'll feel ready to ramp up to Gin's other videos, whether step or strength training, as I already have, and you will no doubt gain the confidence you need to start exercising regularly again. I will not stop now that I've properly started, and as I look forward to staying in shape heading into my forties, I'm happy to credit Gin single-handedly with giving me the perfect mix of motivation and instruction, and the humor to do so (and mind you, and I'm not so easily impressed). Thank you, Gin Miller. You've won me over!",1379376000,5,3063,4.606227106227106

I love this workout because I don't have to think about it, it's that simple. But you will elevate your heart rate. I did stop doing the warmup because I want to get right down to it, so I just start at the second level and, instead of going slowly through the first basic step and the knee lifts, as she's explaining these steps, I start right in at the faster pace. When I eventually am able heart rate wise to do the entire routine, I will then put my first riser on my step.

It is a little slow at times because she is thoroughly explaining moves so sometimes you might get a little bored. The music is not very motivating so try to make the best of it.

I hadn't really thought about step exercises until recently when I was looking for another source of exercise (I use a treadmill and an elliptical weekly). To be honest, I'd never head of Gin Miller, but she got good ratings and even better, I was able to access her immediately through Amazon My TV! All I have to do is open Amazon through my Roku or Apple TV and Amazon videos are immediately available. Frankly, I love not having to use a DVD player.

2327839,2,B0009WIY4S,"I was disappointed in this DVD.  I thought it was going to be more of a traditional workout routine, but truly its a primer of basic step moves with a LOT of repetition.  Great for absolute beginners, but I guess I was expecting a bit more given the other reviews are largely so positive.  I thought it would be a good lower intensity workout and that is why I ordered it.

Gin is wonderful - the original trainer in this method - and I respect her work.  I didn't think this DVD was engaging enough to keep me interested since I have some step experience under my belt (Gilad and Kathy Smith are step trainers I like - their workouts are simple, well cued, and can be varied for low impact or more moderate to low intensity).  I'm over 50 and have 2 left feet, so avoid anything that calls itself ""advanced"" or ""high energy"".

I don't want to be discouraging, but for any others who are looking for a lower intensity standard step workout, you may not want to go with this one unless you really need to start at the absolute beginning (and have a lot of patience).

This dvd is great for the beginner and has several segments so you can work your way up slowly as you increase your stamina.  I am nearly 50 years old and have been doing Leslie Sansone's walking work-outs for years.  This was a good step-up for me.  It took me awhile before I could do the entire dvd straight through, as I found it to be a very good, strenuous work-out.  If you are a veteran stepper, it may be too easy for you, although the routines get more complex as the segments progress.  Gin Miller is very personable and encouraging and explains each step thoroughly.  My only problem is that the step I purchased is a bit higher and not nearly as wide as the one she uses on the dvd.

This is the perfect step program for someone who wants the patterns taught slowly, broken down movement-by-movement by an instructor who is friendly, accessible, easy-going and supportive. If you do the whole DVD, you still get your heart rate up and a decent workout. The instructor is not a young super athlete; she's a fit, middle-aged lady like me.

2327886,4,B0009WIY4S,"I worked out to step aerobics back in the early 1990's and trying it again recently with the DVD, it brought it all back.  Gin Miller, a pioneer in step aerobics takes the beginner through the basic steps clearly and easily.  Her manner is quite informal and keeps you relaxed even while you work up a good sweat.

The recording is not without a few technical glitches.  The transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 is a little off and you have to recalibrate your step a little bit.  Gin also refers to an ""A"" step she's going to show you, and never gets back to it.  Not a big deal, just something to chuckle about.

Also Phase 4 of the DVD I think spends a little too much time learning the turn step and some of the other basic steps are sort of rushed through at the end such as the straddles, etc.

Even with the flaws, this DVD comes highly recommended from this middle-aged clod who needs an indoor exercise program for the cold winter months.  I find I can do this workout daily and add some complexity to it if need be, and this DVD is highly adaptable to this sort of liberty.  Overall, a very nice DVD.",1302048000,3,1108,4.208530805687204

This truly was ""third times a charm"" since it was the last one I tried.  Very easy to follow, good directions and a slow pace for beginners.  I never felt lost - One of the other Step Workouts had the word beginner in the title (Kari Anderson-Workout for Beginners - I'm sure alot of people love this but it was NOT enough of a beginner to me.)

I'd tried the dvd that came with my step kit and found it to be abysmal. No instructions and a fast pace that led me to stamp my feet and plop onto my couch in frustration. Since this one had so many positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. So glad I did! Gin is a fantastic teacher. This is to step aerobics what the ABCs are to writing. She demonstrates the most popular steps in detail, gives you a few trial runs, then goes into a full set. It's actually quite a workout in and of itself.

Highly recommended to anyone who ever watched a step class and thought ""how do they all stay synchronized like that."" Now when I hear ""corner knee,"" I just do it.

The program is broken down into 6 segments and instructs beginners to take it easy at first, maybe just doing the first 2 segments and slowly working up to the whole DVD.  I liked this approach very much, and did that, and would just skip to the cooldown section if I found myself getting too tired.

I really got a lot out of this dvd, and I had never been on a step before. She starts really basic, shows you what to do and how to do it safely, keeps going back to reveiw. It's set up in 10 minute segments, so you can start with 10 minutes, and keep adding as you get stronger. I had my blood pumping and my heart rate up, and by adding the arm movements and raising the step, you could increase the difficulty as needed.

I bought another ""beginner's"" step video and never could figure out what the instructor was doing until she was on another routine.  This was very simple, but yet got your heart moving.  It was broken down into segments in case I didn't have time to finish the whole DVD.",1238457600,2,315,4.491228070175438
2327938,5,B0009WIY4S,"Let's face it, one of the main factors that make or break any type of training DVD is the person doing the instructing.

I think Gin Miller's presentation would appeal to a very large cross-section of people interested in learning the basics of step aerobics. She's not young, she's not old, she's not a rail thin supermodel. She's like a nice next door neighbor who's come over to help you get off the couch and get moving. She does a great job of presenting the material in a laid back, easy to follow manner, and she comes across as a genuinely warm and funny person. I liked the fact that she didn't waste our time trying to plug her other videos.

As for the workout itself, you will most definitely get one. As Gin suggests, you will want to watch the video all the way through at least once before diving in. As a side benefit, you learn to move both your feet and arms to a beat, so this may also be an excellent place to start for those wishing to learn dance.

The only thing I noticed was in the transition between Segments 1 and 2, even though I keep in step with the music, I always end up on the wrong foot when the video for Segment 2 begins, so there might be a slight editing glitch in there.

Anyway, this video is very much worth the asking price.",1237507200,4,1266,4.2190082644628095
2327939,5,B0009WIY4S,"I purchased this video with high expectations.  I'm 27 and in fairly good shape...but not very coordinated!  Gin Miller breaks all the steps down one by one and will have you sweating after each segment.  She even tells you different names other instructors might use for different moves which is really helpfull.  There are six segments in all and after my first try I had to stop after segment three I was so worn out!  But, I had learned a great deal and it just got better after that.  I definately recomend this video to all ages.  It's great for begginers!",1236902400,,562,4.5049504950495045

The instructor there took us from easy to difficult in less than 15 minutes. Needless to say, I didn't do well with the more difficult moves.  Gin Miller's DVD has 6 levels of aerobic steps that is divided in 10 minute sessions, ranging from easy to somewhat advanced.  You can go at your own pace and repeat the steps you don't understand.  Right now I am up to session 5.  The best thing is Gin gives you is advanced, clear voiced, warning of the next ""step"" you will be doing.  What a pleasure, and excellent teacher.",1235001600,2,627,4.553571428571429

Well I read the reviews about Everybody Steps and gave it a try.
This  DVD is GREAT!!  I appreciate the step-by-step explanations, and the easy going manner of Gin Miller.  The idea is to to get you started at the beginning, and get you on the right track.  Definately a guide for the new stepper like me!  When I have this mastered, I'll feel comfortable going to a local class or trying the DVD included with my steps.",1232668800,3,694,4.196969696969697

2327945,5,B0009WIY4S,"I am new to step aerobics.  As a 53 year old walker, I was looking to boost my heart rate to lose the weight.  The work outs are broken down into about 10 minute segments, that flow together, so you can stop when you want. You start with an easy warm-up. Gin takes the time to explain the moves and you do them in ""slow time"" and then pick up the pace.  You will march in place, side-steps, grapevines, basic step ups, knee lifts, side lifts, over the top, etc., followed by some stretching in the final segment. Cuing is usually right on and Gin explains how you should feel with frequent checks on your perceived exertion.  Using a heart rate monitor, I was above a heart rate of 100, but within the ""work out zone"" as recommended by the DVD.  Good for beginners, likely not challenging enough for advanced steppers.",1228521600,2,818,4.3907284768211925

Gin does a thorough job of demonstrating step moves, but surprised me with the pacing. Even doing basic stepping, she is on and off the board so fast I was afraid I would start tripping trying to keep up. I compared the pace with some more advanced step workouts had have gotten since, and they actually are easier to keep up with then this one!

The beginning of the DVD teaches you the steps which was irritating since I already know all the steps but for a person who is new to stepping it would be a valuable tool.  It is sectioned off for different workout levels which is good for those just beginning and those who are advancing.  Gin Miller is great, I love all her workouts, this one is no different.

It is not a tough workout, its definately for beginners but I did get a decent aerobic workout by doing all the different sections, I however quickly moved on to a more advanced step workout.

I would highly recommend this workout to beginners or those who are out of shape, its a great beginning but you will advance past this workout fairly quickly.",1212019200,5,907,4.311764705882353

I'm new to Gin Miller, and I found her to be enthusiastic without being annoying, encouraging without being ""fake"", and most importantly her instructions were clear as was the video footage itself. I won't be requesting the soundtrack to this DVD, but the music is upbeat, keeps a good pace, and I found as I worked out it more or less ""faded"" into the background for me as I got into ""the zone"". The DVD itself is broken into sections, and Gin separates the sections by doing an ""exertion check-in"". I found this check-in was helpful not only in making me stop to think about how hard I was working, but also as a way to stay motivated to go onto the next section.

Seriously - a great DVD for beginners, but can also provide a challenging cardio workout for those who just want to stay away from overly ""dancy"" moves. If you're thinking about joining a stepclass at a gym, try this out. Or, if you want to avoid the gym all together but still want a great workout, this DVD is for you, too.",1203897600,8,1107,4.3478260869565215

Gin Miller explains the steps very clearly and talks about some of the different names that are used for the same steps, as well as explaining some of the variations which build off of the steps she is going over.

Gin Miller is a lovely woman, and odd as it sounds, I found it comforting that she was doing the work out in some baggy workout pants. If you have avoided step classes because of fear of embarrassment, this product will help you get more comfortable. There were one or two moments where I felt like she was taking it a little too slow, but then I ended up being glad she had done that.

Other step aerobic DVD's were much easier after viewing and trying this DVD. I highly recommend it for anyone new to step aerobics, or anyone who is at a novice level for fitness.

Thankfully, I had ordered this DVD. It arrived a few days after the Step platform. I have to say, Wow, what a difference this workout was compaired to the last one I did. (I watched it all the way through as she says to do on the DVD).

Gin explains every move in very good detail by their names. She's fun and encouraging. It's like having a friend explain it all. I think I only miss-stepped a couple of times.

The segments are great and even if you've Stepped before it's worth checking out the 1st one. She not only tells you the names of the steps, but shows you how to do them first at half speed.

The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it isn't designed for anyone that is an advanced stepper.
