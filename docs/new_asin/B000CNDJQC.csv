I should have known when she kept warning people with neck injuries or osteoporosis to skip certain exercises that this program is targeted to people who have such issues. I did not see that information anywhere prior to purchase. I have to admit I did not do the whole program -- after 45 minutes I stopped in frustration. Lynne Robinson obviously knows her stuff, but she talks A LOT between exercises, slowing down what is already a nearly movement-free program. (For example, she introduces the Hundred, but spends so much time on modifications that you don't actually get to do the full exercise!) Really a disappointing waste of time, and now I don't have time to do any actual exercise!

Although I am not a newcomer to Pilates, I am not in the greatest shape. I was hoping for something that would help me get into better shape, and this will not!",1255910400,2,942,4.508771929824562
