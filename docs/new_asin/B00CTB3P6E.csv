8586045,5,B00CTB3P6E,"I am so happy I found this. It really tells the tale of this legendary martial arts family... from Helio, to Rickson and Rolls (who was the most influential but died early in a hang-gliding accident. If you want the definitive backstory of the this historical Jiu Jitsu dynasty this is for you as there is loads of arrival footage stretching all the way back to the 60s, 70s... the narrator may bore but this is more factual in nature so its acceptable",1427846400,3,452,4.457831325301205

8586047,4,B00CTB3P6E,"This was a very good and informational DVD.  Most of what you hear about this subject matter is extremely pleasant and polished (by design).  This DVD explored some of the more painful, sad, and realistic side of family, fame, and dynasty.  Sometimes the language is hard to follow because it constantly flows back and forth between English and Portuguese.  Well worth it if you intend on understanding the nature of BJJ.",1401148800,3,421,4.887323943661972
