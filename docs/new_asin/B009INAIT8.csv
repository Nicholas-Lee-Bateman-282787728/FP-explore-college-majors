8542016,3,B009INAIT8,"Josh Mathews once again host this set showcasing various matches from the past year of both of WWE's flagship shows (RAW & SmackDown) along with various moments including the return of Chris Jericho's ""Highlight Reel"", John Cena having some words for The Rock, The Rock Concert, Brock Lesnar's return & John Cena's response the next week, Daniel Bryan dumps A.J. Lee, Big Show's rampage against Brodus Clay, Santino Marella's ""Sign Of The Night"", D-Generation X reunion, Punk & Cena's war of words of who's ""The Best In The World"", Daniel Bryan & Kane's anger management class, and the debut of MizTV on the Blu-Ray edition.

Matches Include:
Falls Count Anywhere Match: Zack Ryder vs. Kane - Kane was obsessed with making John Cena ""embrace the hate"" to the point where he constantly attacked his friend Zack Ryder for weeks leading to this match where Cena couldn't interfere or Ryder wouldn't get another shot at his U.S. Championship. Ryder came into the match with taped ribs & tried to get some offense in but had no effect as Kane just slowly punished Ryder using whatever he could including the ring post, announce table, steel steps, and the barricade multiple times while also going through the crowd to the stage area pounding on the ribs & torturing Ryder non-stop who refused to give up & kept trying to fight back before Kane delivered one devastating move he couldn't get up from. This was more than just a physical & emotional beating more than a match that did it's job in reestablishing Kane as a monster.
""""RAW"" Jan. 23

C.M. Punk vs. Daniel Bryan - This was a very unique match given not only the circumstances of both men being World Champions but also the history between both men dating back to their days before the WWE which we saw a reference to at the start of the match with a handshake between both of them as Bryan got the early advantage with a dropkick & knee buster & knees to the face before Punk recovered with stiff kicks & knees to the back, a bodyslam, and back breaker. The match got taken to the floor as both men exchanged forearms then went back into the ring where both men had the same idea for a running crossbody only to crash & burn before both men continued to trade momentum with various reversals & counters to each other's offense throughout the contest such as Bryan's missile dropkick & Punk's top rope elbow. This match was a high quality encounter between the two that would be a teaser for their bigger series of matches later in the year.
""RAW"" Jan. 30

No Disqualification Match: Randy Orton vs. Wade Barrett - Orton was out for revenge for Barrett throwing him down the stairs & putting him out of action weeks earlier as both men started off trading strikes in the ring before the action spilled to the outside with Barrett being thrown against the barricades & even suplexed into it before a table was brought into play with Barrett being able to capitalize on it & focus on Orton's previously injured back with a strong whip in the corner & stretching it around the ring post The fight continued through the crowd to ringside back into the ring where the steel steps & a steel chair was used by both men. This match was very much like their entire feud where it came off like a big grudge match fight between the two.
""SmackDown"" Feb. 3

Randy Orton, Sheamus, Big Show vs. Daniel Bryan, Cody Rhodes, The Miz - This was just your basic six man tag match that went back & forth between both teams with each team isolating one member from his partners at one point while telling the various stories between all men going into WrestleMania during & even after the match.
""SmackDown"" Mar. 9

WWE United States Champion Santino Marella vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Jack Swagger - With Johnny Ace now the General Manager of both shows, he created this match with the captain of Teddy Long's WrestleMania team against both Dolph & Swagger who were managed by Vickie Guerrero. This was a glorified handicap match with both men working over Santino together while taking turns showing off as well before a conflict of interest came when it was time for one of them to take the pin & win the title which gave Santino the opportunity to ""divide & conquer."" This wasn't anything special past what it was designed to be.
""RAW"" Apr. 2

No Disqualification Match: Randy Orton vs. Kane - A WrestleMania rematch here as they brawling in the ring to the outside sending each other into the announce table then making their way to the stage area where both men tried to throw the other off before Orton's head was bounced off the stage various times including a DDT by Kane followed by both men making their way back to the ring where Kane began tossing in chairs which both men used to their advantage in one way or another. This was very similar to their previous street fight months earlier where it was physical from start to finish & definitely surpassed their match at Mania earlier in the week.
""SmackDown"" Apr. 6

No Disqualification/No Count Out Match: WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. Mark Henry - With Henry defeating Punk twice in the previous weeks, the special stipulation was put here to ensure there was a winner as Punk went for the ""stick & move"" strategy against Henry with strikes while taking chances like the suicide dive & running the barricades into a bulldog but Henry would eventually catch him using his power & weight to his advantage such as swinging Punk into the barricade & standing on it. The match went back & forth with Henry continuing to wear Punk down with his strength such as a bear hug & catching Punk in mid-air while Punk resorted to creative ways of using a steel chair. This was a great match that played to both men's strengths throughout the match.
""RAW"" Apr. 16

WWE Tag Team Champions Primo & Epico vs. R-Truth & Kofi Kingston - This was your typical tag team match that used the formula of the heels double teaming & working over one babyface building up to the hot tag to his partner as the match itself wasn't anything special past the result.
""RAW"" Apr. 30

Randy Orton vs. Sheamus - This was setup as a preview of the upcoming Fatal Four Way Match at the Over The Limit PPV with two of the four participants facing off here. Both men were at a stalemate early with each one being able to knock the other one down with moves like the dropkick & shoulder block before things got turned up trading fist in the corner to the point where they had to be separated by the referee. The match got taken to the floor by Orton's various clotheslines including one that took Sheamus over the top rope before Sheamus came back sending Orton into the steel steps followed by Orton sending Sheamus' shoulder into the post & used the steps to slam & stomp on it with the match going back into the ring where Orton continued to work over the arm while Sheamus was fighting back using his knee for knee drops & driving it into the midsection. Both men continued to go back & forth with heavy moves from the Irish Curse back breaker, superplex, hanging DDT, and both the RKO & Brogue Kick countered resulting in a quality television match that went close to 20 minutes from both men.
""SmackDown"" May 18

Elimination Match: Christian vs. The Great Khali vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Jack Swagger - With Alberto Del Rio suffering a concussion, this was to determine the new #1 contender for the World Championship at No Way Out. The main story told throughout the match was teams forming to double & triple team a participant in order to eliminate them before eventually turning on each other in the spirit of ""every man"" for himself but definitely the showdowns between Christian against either Swagger or Dolph were the highlights here.
""RAW"" June 11

Vader vs. Heath Slater - This was the beginning of Slater challenging legends leading up to the 1,000 episode of RAW only to be completely destroyed in the process.
""RAW"" June 11

Sheamus vs. Dolph Ziggler - A rematch from No Way Out earlier in the week that saw Dolph starting to ""show off"" very early to which Sheamus responded with takedowns & a fallaway slam into the barricade before slamming his face into the steps before Dolph was able to recover with a fameasser off the steps to the floor on the outside going into an athletic offense such as a dropkick on the apron & a high spike DDT. This overall was a fast paced non-stop competitive match between the two overall.
""SmackDown"" June 22

Rey Mysterio vs. Kane vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Alberto Del Rio - This was to determine the challenger for Sheamus' World Championship at SummerSlam that had so much action leading to various moments like Bryan & Mysterio going aerial by doing dual dives to the outside on Del Rio & Kane before focusing on each other with a sitting dive & flying clothesline, Rio intercepting Mysterio when going for a 619 on Bryan, Kane having various moments of complete dominance, Mysterio's top rope legdrop while Del Rio had Bryan in an armbreaker, how Mysterio going for a head scissors on Kane resulted in a dropkick to the face by Del Rio, and a double 619. This was a fatal four way that saw non-stop action by all four men.
""SmackDown"" July 27

Ryback vs. Curt Hawkins & Tyler Reks - Your typical Ryback squash except it was over two men instead of one.
""RAW"" Aug. 6

Rey Mysterio vs. Cody Rhodes - This was Mysterio's first match back since his concussion at SummerSlam that saw Cody target that injury right away slamming his head against the announce table & also delivering moves that would land Mysterio directly on this head before Rhodes continued his recent obsession by trying to remove the mask which gave Rey an opportunity to regain the advantage. This was an average match that didn't match the feud they had years ago as this the relevance of this match happened afterwords as Mysterio united with someone who had a common enemy in Rhodes backed off Cody's obsession to remove their lucha mask.
""SmackDown"" Aug. 31

Falls Count Anywhere Match: John Cena vs. Alberto Del Rio - This started out with Del Rio in control before Cena was able to catch Del Rio in mid-air with a dropkick before Del Rio was able to regain the advantage sending Cena into the steps as both men traded momentum on the outside going into the crowd & using both the announce table & barricade & even the microphone at one point. They fought up to the stage area taking some hard hits like a suplex on the ramp & head bouncing off the stage before making their way backstage destroying the interview area in the process as well. This was a fun match to watch but the bigger story wasn't who decided to show up in the middle of the match but who that person decided to drive off with.
""RAW"" Sept. 3

Randy Orton vs. Damien Sandow - Dolph Ziggler was on commentary for this match while we got Sandow's thoughts on social media before the match. Sandow kept going to the outside to break Orton's momentum to the point where it caused Orton to follow him out only for him to get distracted allowing Sandow to get the advantage sending Orton in the the ring post before Orton made a comeback but also kept focusing on Dolph at ringside. Just an average match that's only relevant for the post match confrontation.
""SmackDown"" Sept. 7

Kofi Kingston vs. Dolph Ziggler - We got a funny interaction between Vickie & ""Little Jimmy"" before the match which started off with Kofi going high risk with a flip dive over the top rope early causing Dolph to try to ground Kofi with moves like a chinlock along with and inside out flip slam as they traded momentum back & forth with both men pulling out their signature moves while also having reversals & counters to the holds themselves as well. This didn't go as long as most of their previous encounters but was what Michael Cole called ""a hard fought matchup.""
""RAW"" Sept. 24

Beth Phoenix vs. Natalya - This was in Beth's hometown of Buffalo with the former partners starting off with mutual respect by shaking hands before the match but eventually started to get aggressive after one was shoved & the other was slapped leading into both girls hitting their trademark holds of the GlamSlam & Sharpshooter only to see the other either power out of it. This was a real short match but nice for what it was.
""SmackDown"" Sept. 28

Ryback vs. Tensai - Another Ryback squash match except this was over a opponent who matched him in size.
""SmackDown"" Sept. 28

Sheamus vs. Damien Sandow - Cody Rhodes was on commentary for this match that saw Sandow retreat to the outside various times causing Sheamus to chase only for Cody to cause a distraction allowing Sandow to take over showing a mean streak keeping Sheamus down with moves like the seated head scissors & side chinlock before Sheamus was able to fight back such as a top rope battery ram causing Cody to once again get involved. This was the best showcase of Sandow to date as far as his in-ring ability.
""RAW"" Oct. 1

Daniel Bryan & Kane vs. Alberto Del Rio & David Otunga - It was during this period that Kane & Bryan were still in the beginning stages of being a tag team despite also being the champions while also still working out their anger management issues which was shown in throughout this match with both guys declaring ""I'm the tag team champions!"" to the point where each guy tried to have the spotlight to themselves like Bryan attempting a blind tag at one point only to get caught while later doing a blind tag after Kane did most of the work. The match itself wasn't anything special past putting over the dysfunction of the team.
""SmackDown"" Oct. 5

C.M. Punk vs. Dolph Ziggler - A unique match considering how both men weren't fan favorites, both had two of the most outspoken & hated managers in their corners, and both men had an issue with each other for walking out of tag matches in recent weeks. Both men started off with stalemates & continued throughout the match with each man giving as much as they received like fight on the top rope with both falling off, both doing a roll through for a pin attempt, and both taking some hard hits like the Fameasser & GTS. This was a solid match up as both men were evenly matches from start to finish.
""SmackDown"" Oct. 5

C.M. Punk vs. Mr. McMahon - This was Mr. McMahon's first match in over 2 year in order to teach Punk about respect only for Punk to not show any by attacking Vince from behind & continuing to stay in control while mocking him on commentary & bruising his eye but Vince came back sending Punk first into the post then over the announce table & diving after him followed by getting his shot on Heyman as the action went back into the ring with both men having a kendo stick to use. With a Mr. McMahon match, you know your not going to get a technical in-ring quality wrestling match more than an entertaining brawl which is what this was.
""RAW"" Oct. 8

Daniel Bryan vs. Dolph Ziggler - Both men traded momentum early with Bryan working over Dolph's legs with a unique chinlock submission that also locked his knees followed by a knee buster & figure four only for him to eventually hurt his own leg as they went back & forth with counters to the other's hold while hitting some high impact moves like a high spike DDT, a missed splash in the corner with such impact that it sent him over the top rope to the floor, suicide dive & an X-Factor from the top rope. If anyone has seen their previous matches, you know they deliver a non-stop fast paced quality encounter & that's no different here.
""RAW"" Oct. 22

John Cena & Ryback vs. C.M. Punk & Dolph Ziggler - There were issues between both teams here as Punk & Ziggler had their issues from tag matches in the past while this was Cena's first match back after arm surgery along with Rybacks' first ever tag team match but this was pretty much a glorified handicap match as Cena was in throughout the entire match with both Dolph & Punk working together against him only to build to the eventual hot tag to the dominate unstoppable Ryback. Simple tag match but nothing special.
""RAW"" Nov. 5

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Randy Orton vs. Alberto Del Rio - Both men started out lobbying for control with Rio retreating & Orton following him around the arena from the lobby to in the crowd before Del Rio was able to gain control using whatever was around him including a chair, ring post, and barricade. Orton fought back taking the match back to the outside with Del Rio getting backdropped onto the ramp & giving receipts for the earlier chairshots while Ricardo Rodriquez attempted to get involved & paying the price for it but Del Rio was able to catch Orton off guard that ended up sending him through a table as Del Rio continued to taunt Orton berating him on the microphone. There two were feuding for a short time but did come off as an aggressive brawl between two men trying to prove who was the real ""apex predator.""
""SmackDown"" Nov. 6

(Blu-Ray) United States Champion Jack Swagger vs. Santino Marella - A couple of notes here in that during this time Teddy Long & John Laurinaitis were feuding over who was the better General Manager & be able to control both shows with this particular week the G.M.'s switching running shows allowing Long to set up this match with his assistant Santino getting the title shot as this was more of a segment than an actual match as associates of both competitors quickly got involved in this match causing all shorts of chaos in & outside of the ring as this was more about pushing the issues between Long & Laurinaitis more than anything else.
""RAW"" Mar. 5

(Blu-Ray) C.M. Punk & Sheamus vs. Daniel Bryan & Kane - This was a rare moment with the WWE & World Champions teaming together as Bryan & Kane were able to gain the early control singling out one opponent being able to stop any momentum dead while Punk & Sheamus were able to take advantage of using their opponents against each other as both teams were evenly matched with one partner utilizing their power & their opponent with power strikes & wrestling ability trading momentum both on the mat & in the air in what was a back & forth contest with the bigger story of not only who decided to appear but what they were wearing & doing that definitely caught everyone's attention.
""RAW"" June 18

(Blu-Ray) Intercontinental Champion The Miz vs. Christian - This was a rematch from RAW 1000 with Miz now defending the championship as both men went back & forth early before Miz was able to take control working over the head & neck area using whatever tactics his could while Christian used his aerial offense with both men having various counters & reversals to the other's signature offense along with series of pinning combinations in a competitive encounter.
""SmackDown"" July 27

(Blu-Ray) Street Fight Match: Sheamus vs. Daniel Bryan - This was a RAWactive match with the fans voting on the match stipulation as both men started off trading different strikes before the match was taken to the outside with various areas of the environment coming into play from ringside all the way to the stage area with weapons being used in methodical ways to work over an area of the body or make a regular move more impactful in what was another physical match in their series of encounters since after WrestleMania earlier in the year.
""RAW"" July 30

(Blu-Ray) Randy Orton vs. Wade Barrett - Orton was looking for revenge for an attack earlier in the night taking the match to the outside early on working over his opponent with different suplexes & stomps while Barrett was able to gain momentum countering Orton's signature offense & taking shortcuts using the different areas of the ring to his advantage as they traded momentum catching the other & continuing to deliver some impactful offense in what ultimately came down to one man taking advantage of another's distraction.
""SmackDown"" Oct. 26

There wasn't much room for every single standout or relevant match on each show to be put on here but there's always certain matches that could have easily been left out in favor of those that didn't make the cut as they didn't have any real relevance to be put on a ""Best Of"" set as although they did have some of the best quality TV matches on here, there were too many that really didn't have much importance or relevance compared to the collections of previous years. In the end, I would still check it out if you were a fan of the TV product.",1396137600,,20359,4.5447354064375345
8542017,5,B009INAIT8,"first off, let me say, I wasn't planning on buying this product, and bought it on a whim with a gift card.  Let me  tell you so glad I did. Compared to last years best of raw and smackdown, NO COMPARRISON.  Awsome matches including falls count anywhere matches, and street fights,Great memories aloso including The rock concert, DX reuniting, the return of brock lezner, big shows rampage, just to name a few.  The only bad thing I can say is that the PG rating for this DVD, is misleading Definatly from what ive seen so far in my opionion, not appropriate for younger viewers at all.  I would say at least a TV14 rating, due to violence, and suggestive language.  But in reality thats what makes it great, hard hitting violent matches, which includes regular matches, the return of brock lezner, the cena and lezner brawl on raw, and big shows rampage as well.  Being a fan of ECW this one is right up my ally.  If you have been a long time wrestling fan, check this one out, hope you enjoy it, I know I did.",1366588800,,1010,4.363636363636363

8542019,5,B009INAIT8,This is a great set from WWE. The picture quality on the Blu Ray is amazing and the sound is also breathtaking. The matches that I have watched so far have been excellent. I really enjoy being able to watch these matches without the barrage of commercials that normally occur on any give Raw and Smackdown. This is a no brainer for any wrestling fan. You get hours upon hours of action in 1080 P quality. If you or anyone you know loves wrestling I would definitely recommend picking up this set!!!!,1359417600,,499,4.434782608695652
