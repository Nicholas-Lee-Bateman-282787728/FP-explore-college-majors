1934069,5,B0000E3J8O,"Although this is only what I consider an introduction to The Inca Healing

methods it provides an important overview with wonderful pictures.

I fully recomend also the books from Dr. Alberto Villoldo especially

Shaman,Healer,Sage......",1174089600,6,237,5.911764705882353
1934070,4,B0000E3J8O,"It was informative.  But, kind of slow starting out.  Stay with it and you will be happy you did.",1173312000,3,97,4.052631578947368
1934071,3,B0000E3J8O,"There are no directions for healing.. only explanations in a general way about this approach. Nicely done though. Just more general, ad for buying Villaldos books or courses.",1168732800,12,174,5.25
1934072,2,B0000E3J8O,"A bit shallow I think. It doesn't present Villoldo's work especially good. I've met him on an earlier occasion, and I use his tools in my own practice, but this video doesn't come close to what I think he stands for",1162684800,17,215,4.2682926829268295
1934073,1,B0000E3J8O,"This DVD is basically a come-on to entice you to enroll in Villoldo's school.  When I read the intro in the Gaiam catalog, where I first saw this video and ordered it, it read as an instructional video.  Even on the back of the DVD cover itself there is an inference that it is more than just a presentaion of infomation.

I genuinely thought this was an instructional video and it most definitely is not.  I was hugely disappointed.  I regret spending the money for this video.

If you're wanting a How-To then pass this one up!

I gave it a one-star rating simply because there wasn't a lower choice.",1150761600,53,602,4.418181818181818
1934074,5,B0000E3J8O,"This DVD opened my eyes and mind to a new level of awareness and perception of the  world of health and disease. I have always enjoyed and benefited from reading Dr. Villoldo's books but in many ways as an introduction to his work, I liked this production even more. It contains an intimate and frank discussion of the basic principles of his work, his perspective and teachings on the luminous energy body, which are brought to life by the powerful and evocative visionary paintings of artist Alex Grey.  I also really enjoyed the intimacy of hearing Dr. Villoldo `s personal stories and the stories of how these healing techniques have assisted people in releasing their negative physical, mental and emotional patterns.

Since he began his work as a medical anthropologist and then moved on to study with the Inkan Shamans, Dr. Villoldo has the unique ability to clearly articulate these teachings in a way that people who are new to the world of energy medicine and alternative healing will really comprehend.  I intend to recommend and purchase this DVD for friends and family members who are beginning to express interest in discovering more holistic healing modalities than what they are experiencing through the current medical model.",1150243200,29,1242,5.014563106796117
1934075,4,B0000E3J8O,"While I loved this DVD as far as the history and application of this material is concerned it does NOT delve into technique, which is why I purchased it to begin with. Like others here I was hoping for specific techniques that would explain how to clear the energy field but came away very disappointed. Villoldo builds slowly over the course of 72 minutes about the history and origins of this fascinating topic, explains how we are all affected by different types of energy, gives the symptomology of energy 'contamination', but leaves out the all-important part: How do you clear the energy field? Lets hope he answers this question in forthcoming DVD's.",1147910400,53,657,4.875
1934076,5,B0000E3J8O,"This is one of the most fascinating DVDs I have ever seen about healing. After watching it, for the first time I understand the nature and function of the luminous energy field in a way that totally makes sense. It was also the first time I have seen the remarkable artistic expression of Alex Grey. What a great idea to combine Dr. Villoldo's knowledge of the human energy system with Alex Grey's paintings. They bring to visible expression the extraordinary concepts and images that Dr. Villoldo is presenting. For example when Dr. Villoldo speaks of the impact of familial imprints, negative energies and entities on the luminous field, the screen comes alive with Alex Grey's painting of this energetic expression.

I highly recommend this DVD.  My eyes have been opened to a new realm of knowledge and awareness of the nature of illness, and the path to optimal health and healing. Thank you Dr. Villoldo for your deep and profound work.",1140912000,29,942,4.84472049689441
1934077,3,B0000E3J8O,"Personally, I have many of Alberto Villoldo's books and I really appreciate what this man has to share with us.  ""Healing the Luminous Body"" is very informative in many respects and it would not be a waste of one's time or money to purchase or spend time with it.  However, for my own purposes, from someone who works with healing energy, I guess I was hoping for more instruction on how I could apply this information to my healing practice.  I really feel that I should watch this again before I make a definite conclusion.  Keep in mind that this is my first impression and that it left me bit disappointed.  I suppose that I was looking for more hands on instruction.  I still love Alberto and will not shy from purchasing anything new he comes out with.  I would just like more instruction on how to use the information he gives.",1122854400,98,834,4.447368421052632
1934078,4,B0000E3J8O,"Overall this dvd was well done. It is basically a talk given by Alberto describing his healing practices and the energy body. This is a great intro to a great mans work. I really enjoyed Villoldos books and believe that he is a great teacher. I would have liked to have seen a demonstration in this video. Maybe a live healing/ cleansing or some guided meditation. Perhaps his technique on balancing the chakras.

Thank You Alberto...Paul",1112227200,92,438,4.7631578947368425
1934099,5,B0000E3J8O,"I wanted a DVD to explain shamanism and the history. This DVD did the job. The material is presented in a clear and organized way. It explains 3 phases of shamanism. The first is getting connected to the energy and obtaining guides and helpers, then extractions and finally soul retrievals.",1400457600,,290,4.82
1934100,5,B0000E3J8O,I really liked the DVD.  It provided a nice level of clarification around the subject.  It has peeked my curiosity and personal quest for knowledge.,1393545600,,148,4.88
1934101,5,B0000E3J8O,"It is in a format where Dr Villoldo is talking about his work.  There are a few cut away scenes of him in various environments, also some very arresting paintings by Alex Grey.  But just so you know, this is more of an interview.  I loved it.  He speaks very well with a kindness and sincerity that pulls you in.  He made sense to me in what he was saying.",1387324800,,356,4.0285714285714285
1934102,5,B0000E3J8O,"Alberto Villoldo, Ph. D., is an anthropologist who went to the Andes and Amazon to study Peruvian shamanism and became a shaman after years of being a student of and receiving initiations from the Native Shamans he'd gone to observe.  This DVD is Villoldo's clear, concise articulation of the energy field, the Luminous Body, which surrounds and informs the physical body.  Incorporating Alex Grey's paintings of energy, of Spirit surrounding and embodied in the physical, Villoldo explains that the Luminous Body is the software which informs the hardware of the physical body, that dis-ease first appears in the Luminous Body and can be healed there through the energy work of the Shamans.  (Think an energy cousin to Reiki.)",1379808000,,727,5.1440677966101696
1934103,5,B0000E3J8O,"For spiritual seekers with an interest in Shamanism, this video of Albeto Villoldo is extremely rewarding on multiple levels. Content of his message will be appreciated by novice and adept alike. His words may be experienced as a palatable transmission of spiritual frequencies. Villoldo shares some universal parallels from a number of different spiritual traditions.",1376524800,,368,5.709090909090909

content. No need to buy later version.",1372032000,,131,4.28
1934105,4,B0000E3J8O,"I liked the video, it was enjoyable and interesting although my only complaint is that I expected more instructions on how to heal the luminous body, more detail. One needs to read his books for that. There was a lot of interesting stuff in it though, enough that I feel it was worth buying as a companion to the books. Beutiful visuals of Alex Greys paintings to illistrate aspects of the energy bodys. And a nice talk in the beginning from Alberto. Its more an introduction than a really in depth teaching video. But to many it will be things they were not aware of, I suppose I have made a point of learning a lot of what was contained already, from other sources and experiences, so its really relative that I say what I do. I would say if this is a subject you have not delved into that you will find what is contained  in this a lot of new and exciting info. I am still glad that I bought it though, and feel there was enough in it for me to feel that despite being aware of some of the info already.",1370908800,,1006,4.158974358974359
1934106,5,B0000E3J8O,Alberto has such a nice way of writing.  Makes it an easy read and so speeds the comprehension.  I will eventually read all of his books.,1368921600,,137,4.230769230769231
1934107,5,B0000E3J8O,Alberto Villoldo is a great Shaman and has written an excellent book once again.  I truly enjoyed the information in this book and the way it was presented.  A very good read.,1365033600,,175,4.4375
1934108,5,B0000E3J8O,Alberto shows us how ours thoughts and conscious and unconscious mind and emotions we  connect to from the beginning of  our birth  effects us on a emotional and physical level and how we can clear and be healed.,1361491200,,212,4.526315789473684
1934119,1,B0000E3J8O,Basically just someones philosophical view point and not necessarily helpful in any way to practical healing technologies. Maybe I'm too studied in this information to not be biased against a shallow video that does not put real tools at your disposal.,1356652800,2,252,5.170731707317073
1934120,5,B0000E3J8O,"This video contains alot of factual information regarding foundational concepts of spirituality. If you pay your money to see this, you won't be disappointed.",1348531200,3,158,5.625
1934121,5,B0000E3J8O,This film is exactly what I was looking for to explain our energy field and what leads to disease. The artwork illustrating these fields was excellent.,1344038400,4,151,4.846153846153846
1934122,5,B0000E3J8O,"Excellent Film, If your into We'll Being, Metaphysics or Esoteric teachings you'll enjoy this. It starts out a little vague then dives right into the heart of the problem.",1329004800,5,171,4.931034482758621

1934125,5,B0000E3J8O,"Here is another sage that is leading the way towards medicine of the future. Dr. Alberto explains energy fields and how our energy field contains the imprints that then determine our health. Again, like Dr Bruce Lipton, Dr Alberto is showing us how these imprints are what then determine our health, not genetics, but epigenetics.  Dr Alberto takes the viewer through how we are made up of energy and that this energy is influenced by other energies and vice versa. Going into a forest when we are not in tune with nature, silences all the activity in the forest. But when we become one with all we can enter the forest and not cause a disturbance. How amazing!

1934126,3,B0000E3J8O,"Being a healer for the past 6 years, I was hoping to get a little more instruction on the ""how tos"" of this mans work.  Although informative and a decent ""add"" to my collection, it was merely an overview into shamanism.  Not bad but not great either, sorry to say.",1202947200,2,264,4.26
1934127,1,B0000E3J8O,"This dvd has horrible pruduction values. In it Mr. Villoldo hobbles around with a walking stick preaching about how the white man is destroying Mother Earth. Any ""healing"" methods taught are fake & superficial at best. This dvd is creepy, boring, & a waste of money, time & energy.",1201219200,,281,4.755102040816326

8001777,2,B0000E3J8O,"If you have read any of the authors books, then there is nothing new in this for you.  This is a high-level explanation of the four winds school and their programs along with some autobiographical accounts.  This school teaches a concoction of various Andean, psuedo-Andean, and non-Andean techniques and concepts.  There are also a lot of non-verifiable statements such as 8th chakra, etc.

At 1:08:50 I could not believe what I was hearing.  That medicine has contributed to the decline and extinction of the human race ""by saving the lives of weak and infirm children that nature would not have otherwise selected to survive. .... We're selecting to save the lives of children ... that nature would not otherwise selected to survive.""  This topic is skirting very close to eugenics and the Groningen Protocol.  Certainly we need to question the role of the business of allopathic medicine and vaccinations and it's implications for the population of the planet.  Should we go back to high infant mortality rates and high rates of death of women giving birth?  Should we just allow plagues to wander across the planet at will?  Isn't the real issue tied up into uncontrolled breeding much of which is encouraged by certain religions?  These are serious philosophical questions for everyone.  Better education and availability of contraception is required to deal with this.  But to direct the focus of this discussion towards the children who should apparently not be here and are causing the extinction of the human race because they are 'weak and infirm', as this talk does, is disappointing.

Overall there is annoying background music that pops up frequently.  This would have been better as a podcast or just released on youtube.  As a DVD or pay per view, not so much.

This is something you might watch one, but there is nothing here to go back to.

8001782,5,B0000E3J8O,"'Healing the Luminous Body' was my first access to Dr. Villoldos unique healing methods that he exposes in more detail in his books. This DVD is very well done, a calm and peaceful introduction into the philosophy, the development and the effectiveness of healing the luminous body..

Dr. Villoldo expresses himself fluently, and he is able to inform about the unusual subject in a competent and poised manner. It becomes clear that he speaks of experience, not of theory. The video also retraces his professional way, how he got to the knowledge that today benefits so many people in the West, and how, at the start, he was really a pioneer. In this sense, despite enlightening new openings presented to a greater public in the film What the Bleep Do We Know!?, people like Alberto Villoldo swim against the stream.

For the enlightenment, as in all times of turmoil and change, does not seem to reach the small oligarchy that handle the levers and push the buttons, and that use red telephones and secret services. I say this to prevent you from falling in an unreal new age enthusiasm that deprives so many people today of their feet and lets them float in the pure air of meditation, spirituality and angels.

Villoldo is not one of those lofty spirits! His teaching is grounded, and therefore helps us connect with the not so luminous forces in us, our inner shadow, or all the shadows that are the results of the imprints in our luminous body, which are for the most part the consequences of early abuse suffered as children, or that go back to former lifetimes.

Villoldo is not only a fabulous author, who is able to wrap his teaching in a beautiful and wistful poetic style, but hes also a great orator, and his way of talking triggered in me pure hope, love, and enthusiasm. I am thankful for this wonderful DVD as it helps to introduce in his teaching which is not as easy to apply as it seems on first sight. After all, it is taken from a culture almost opposite to ours, a culture that is psychologically and spiritually much higher evolved than ours.",1401408000,2,2064,4.615803814713897
