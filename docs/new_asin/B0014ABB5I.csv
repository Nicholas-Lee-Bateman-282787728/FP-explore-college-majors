8254805,1,B0014ABB5I,"This is another one of those ""FOLLOW ME AS I DO MY WORK OUT"" dvd's. This is not a professionally done video. Someone with a camcorder just follows him around while he does his work out. This lighting is dim and the quality of the video is not worth the money I paid for. This video is only good for the novice who has no clue how to use the equipment in the gym. He doesn't even take the time to explain the proper lifting techniques. I sat through the whole dvd hoping to gain some insight into natural bodybuilding. I fell asleep through most of it though!! Afterwards I chucked the dvd in the nearest trash can.",1392076800,,614,4.211864406779661
8254806,4,B0014ABB5I,"Really enjoyed this DVD.  Kevin shows what's required to build a great physique.  Talks throughout the DVD. I took notes as he was going through his workout.  I took notes on the workout he was showing but also on his whole advice.  There are nuggets of information throughout the DVD.  How he trains, thinks and his whole mindset. It really is full of great information.  The DVD itself doesn't show exercises from different angles so that why I dropped it by 1 star.  But when you listen you see that every workout he does is slightly different.  And he pushes his workouts and is totally involved.  He is in great shape by working out 3 days a week. And most workouts are perhaps 45 minutes.  He also talks about diet but not too much.  I will be keeping an eye out for other products by Kevin.  After watching this DVD, I read the book called Alpha 2.0 which was no good.  I will definitely advertise Kevin's DVD on my website [...]  So I recommend this DVD.  For all the nuggets of his expertise, years of experience and mindset it is well worth it. And it's not just for bodybuilders.  It's for anyone who goes to the gym and wants to know how to train.",1368057600,,1159,4.345794392523365
