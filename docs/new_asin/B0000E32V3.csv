1933819,5,B0000E32V3,"This is a remarkably funny and scathingly sarcastic tale of a dreamer, ""Milwaukee"" Steve (Steve Burrows), who's bound and determined to make it in Hollywood as a writer/director.  Locations are based between LA and Milwaukee, and the contrast couldn't be more ideal.  Traci Lords is excellent as the unlikely love interest, as is the surprisingly well-known and first-rate supporting cast for an indie of Tim Matheson, (Otter in Animal House, playing a hyper-lunatic composite of every sleazy producer Milwaukee Steve's dealt with in Hollywood), Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, Fred Willard and A.J Benza as Steve's hilarious ass-kissing and fair-weather-friend agents, even Abe Vigoda as a French Spy.  We grew up in the Milwaukee area, so we couldn't get enough of hundreds of quirky location shoots, eccentric corner quarter-tap bars and hangouts (Hollar House, tons more) that truly made the city fun and famous, and it doesn't matter if you're not from the area -- we brought friends with that weren't who still thought it was the funniest film they'd seen in years.  To top it off, Steve spoke at the premiere and said the film is ""roughly 98% true.""  I'm buying several copies of the DVD for gifts.  Steve Burrows is a rare fresh force in comedy, his style unlike anything else in the tired stand-up/sitcom-star field.  To paraphrase Tim Matheson, ""I just love you, love your film...what was it called again?""  What an incredible debut, expect great things from this guy.",1069200000,11,1476,5.045267489711934
8001761,5,B0000E32V3,"I enjoyed this film completely and, for me, it came out of nowhere. I found Steve Burrows incredibly likable and very funny; and he was surrounded by a great cast. If you are in the mood for an intelligent bit of fun, with some surprisingly effective moments, give Chump Change a try. Most surprising of all is how sweet, adorable, and talented is Traci Lords. She's a really fine comedic actress with the gift of natural timing.",1372896000,2,429,4.584415584415584
8001762,4,B0000E32V3,"this is a decent movie.  if you are from wisconsin or are familiar with the areas around milwaukee, it's exciting to see them in the movie.  good extra features.",1309305600,2,161,4.517241379310345
8001763,4,B0000E32V3,"Both clever and silly, this witty, well-written, well-acted little comedy deserved more confidence than the marketers seem to have had in it. Despite a series of film festival awards in 2001, it largely disappeared from view until quietly released on DVD in 2004.

This is hardly the first film to take a poke at its own industry and it surely won't be the last - Something to Sing About from 1937 with James Cagney, or the superb and darkly humorous The Player from 1992 with Tim Robbins are just two examples, though Chump Change makes no pretense of being anything so upscale as either. It is a very small movie made on a limited budget.  However, Stephen Burrows, who also wrote and directed, enjoyably portrays an actor/comedian/screenwriter trying to get in touch with his roots after being overwhelmed in Hollywood. Traci Lords is utterly charming in an atypical role.

Other reviews demonstrate this movie is not for everyone, but I found it likable and funny.",1182816000,2,968,4.8545454545454545
8001764,5,B0000E32V3,"This is what you need.

Deep Comedy.

It's the kind of film that requires, NO, deserves multiple screenings.

If you are looking for an explanation to the pathos that drives Hollywood, it resides here. Laugh at these people, or else...",1168300800,2,235,4.825
8001765,1,B0000E32V3,"If you've seen Christopher Guest's 1989 film, The Big Picture, then you've seen Chump Change (a much much better version, of course). This D-List chump borrows much of it's plot from The Big Picture - small town guy in big bad Hollywood, with two-faced agents and managers, crazy producers, a film deal that dies when the studio head gets fired and both have very similar happy endings. The boring, short and indulgent DVD bonus scenes should have stayed on the cutting room floor.  Merv Griffin: thanks (not) for ""Chump.""",1127433600,2,522,4.865168539325842
8001766,5,B0000E32V3,"Chump Change is hilarious!

Why isn't this guy making more movies.

Buy it, this is the one - out of the dozens of DVD's you own -  that you'll actually watch over and over.",1119398400,2,173,4.029411764705882
8001767,1,B0000E32V3,"This movie was NOT funny at all...save your money...I lived in Milwaukee....I went to the same High school as ""Milwaukee Steve""..and I couldn't even muster a chuckle...its BAD....real real BAD!!!!!!",1091664000,,198,5.633333333333334
8001768,3,B0000E32V3,Not enough substance to carry the movie through to the end but there are definitely plenty of funny moments.  The acting is pretty good and I found the characters believable and likeable.  Excellent casting.  Nicely done DVD including good director's commentary.  I think this movie deserves more notice.,1081728000,6,304,5.270833333333333
8001769,5,B0000E32V3,"There is really only one reason to purchase a DVD copy of Chump Change: It's flat out FUNNY.
If, like me, you were at the premier in Milwaukee, you know what I mean.
The director did a masterful job of comparing/contrasting the two centers of his existence. Milwaukee: cold and gray on the exterior, yet warm and sunny on the inside; Los Angeles: its polar opposite.
He manages to paint this portrait, while still making you roar with laughter throughout.
The director and location crew deserve Academy Awards, as I have never seen a film whose scenes were shot so well, in such unusual places. You don't need to be from Milwaukee to appreciate this, but if you are, these scenes will bring sentimental smiles to your face. If you aren't, this film will make feel like you're a natural born cheesehead.
It's hard to conceive that the ridiculous sequence of events that pull this movie together are based on ""Milwaukee"" Steve's real life, but it's true. One cannot help but appreciate the perseverance of a guy who gets kicked in the head so often, and keeps getting back up for more. The Wheel of Fortune scene is one of the funniest things ever filmed. Writer/director Burrows could write a feature based on that alone. Maybe he already has?
The supporting cast of Lords, Matheson, Jerry & Amy Stiller, Meara, Willard, Vigoda, etal, is superb. Kudos to Burrows and his casting crew for being able to secure actors of notoriety on what would certainly qualify as less than a shoestring budget.
Simply put, this film deserves you attention, because it is the funniest, sweetest, most true to life romp through lunacy you may ever experience.
Looking forward to more from Burrows. I would expect Miramax won't miss an opportunity to bring his next effort to the masses via the big screen.",1070582400,8,1786,4.745980707395498
