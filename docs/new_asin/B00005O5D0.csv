1638841,3,B00005O5D0,"This dvd I was expecting something a bit better because it was from Ruggero Deodato,who as you all undoubtley know gave us the mother of all cannibal movies 'Cannibal Holocaust'.I was not too dissappointed. The story builds up slowly and builds the suspense,not just going for shock and gore like films such as cannibal ferox etc( I still like ferox too)But the middle of the film was where it started becoming a bit boring as the main character was imprisoned in the cannibals cave and basically sitting there watching them drag various animals in and kill them in front of him(FOR REAL AS USUAL)Yes, as one caring reviewer wrote somewhere in these pages,you know what to expect when you buy these movies,so do not complain. Fair enough we do know what to expect,but that does not mean we have to enjoy seeing it. I think it would be better to cut out the animal scences but still keep all the sex and violence between the actors/actresses in of course,because it is what cannibal movies are all about of course. Because we know it is not REAL so can laugh at it. Anyway, once he escapes with the foxy cannibal chick,things get going again and are quite exciting especially when he gets it on with her! Allthough that did not happen enough for me as well! The film also seems to have some sequences from other cannibal movies mixed in with it or vice versa which seems lazy. As A DVD this is pretty good,picture was niceley done anamorphic but not brilliant transfer,the sound seemed ok stereo but in the cave sequences it gets really distorted as the exicted cannibals are shouting,which was crap. There are a few extras and even a commentary but I think it is in Italian!(oh well better than nothing i suppose)and some quite amusing menus which make chomping noises when activated. Not the worst cannibal movie i have purchased by a long shot,but the animal deaths spoil it as usual.",1013817600,5,1886,4.649700598802395

I watched this movie at a late night showing at a theater in Miami when I was about 17 yrs. old. I gotta tell ya this film is a true masterpiece it does have it's share of disgusting gore scenes but not as often as Umberto Lenzi's ""Cannibal Ferox"". There are two real animal death scenes in this film and these cannibals mean serious buisiness about where they get their beef. I give this one a 150 on the puke meter.

1638844,4,B00005O5D0,"Anyone into Italian horror movies during the mid to late '80's should know about the ""Past Land Chunk Blowers"" from reading Chas Balun's ""Piece 'O Mind"" column in GoreZone magazine or his other publication, Deep Red. They include such juicy titles as Cannibal Holocaust, Dawn of the Mummy, Burial Ground, Buried Alive, Dr. Butcher MD, and a score of others. Jungle Holocaust (aka Ultimo Mondo Cannibale) was Ruggero Deodato's first cannibal movie, made a few years before Cannibal Holocaust. It's not quite as well known, or notorious, as Cannibal Holocaust, but it does have a pretty good story. A plane crash lands in the jungle. At nightfall the cannibals creep out of the jungle and end up killing all but two of the survivors. They build a raft in order to escape down river, but it crashes on some rocks. The two survivors get separated and the rest of the movie chronicles the capture of Robert (one of the two survivors) by the cannibals. Of course the plot is secondary to the humiliation and torture that the main character goes through at the hands of the cannibals. Near the end of the movie, Robert escapes with the help of a hot looking cannibal babe (played by Me Me Lai, who went on to become a cannibal movie veteran). The tribe eventually catches up to them, and they get some really gory revenge on the traitorous cannibal woman. Here's some other ""Third World Cannibal Movies"": Cannibal Ferox (aka Make Them Die Slowly, Trap Them and Kill Them (aka Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals), Man from Deep River, White Cannibal Queen, Eaten Alive (aka The Emerald Jungle).",1004572800,15,1584,4.763636363636364

1638867,2,B00005O5D0,"Cheesy late-70s horror/action Italian import about a plane crash, two white men lost in the jungle, separation, capture, and escape.  Despite the hoopla, the grand packaging (interviews, director commentary, stills gallery, etc.) and premium pricing this gory little exploitation film isn't going to win a lot of new fans to the genre.  After the plane crashes and the civilized men are separated, the tall one is captured by a tribe of... cannibals!  He escapes and they chase him (Why do those chase scenes remind me so much of the Tasmanian Devil chasing Bugs Bunny?) Will our hero escape and get back to the airplane before he's captured and the natives feast on his still-beating heart?

  I've quit expecting Italian made movies to contain much in the way of plots.  Oh, JUNGLE HOLOCAUST does take you from point A to point C - plane crash to capture to escape - but nothing terribly exciting happens along the way.  What the heck, you don't watch a grinder like this for its elaborate plot or intricate characterizations, anyway.  You watch it to see:

- the hero retch a gulletful of pea soup

- people impaled on sharp, pointy sticks

- the cannibals at dinner (atrocious table manner, suspicious looking main course)

- an awful lot of nudity.  The hero spends half the movie in his flag-flapping birthday suit, the native girl he kidnaps (played by the provocatively named Me Me Lai) wears only a thong, most of the time

- various human internal organs, ripped and et raw

- real animals really killed on camera

 In the commentary and interviews, the director and star both disclaim responsibility for the scenes in which animals are killed on camera. We're told, a number of times, the movie's producers shot and edited in these scenes for the Far East market.  Be that as it may, the killing scenes are in keeping with the sensationalistic spirit of the rest of this movie.  The whole point is to entertain by assaulting the senses.  It's one thing for an actor to pretend to gnaw on a sheep's kidney and make believe it's a human heart.  It's fakery and the audience knows it's fakery.  Filming a crocodile being stunned and then skinned alive is another matter all together.  You don't have to be a prude to object to the graphically violent naturalism in a movie like JUNGLE HOLOCAUST.  Finding skulls teeming with maggots, or filming an actor disgorging a mouthful of prop vomit, is lowest common denominator stuff.  You don't have to be an animal right's activist to strongly object to animals being killed so a schlock Italian b-horror flick can sell more tickets in Kuala Lampur. Anyone can resent a movie that panders to an audiences' prurient interests.  There WAS an interesting movie in here somewhere.  The movie was shot on location, the lead actor was good, the photography - considering the difficult location - was very good.  But there was an awful lot I disliked here, and there's no way I'd recommend this movie to anyone.",1175212800,3,2956,4.7637795275590555
1638868,5,B00005O5D0,"although ruggero deodatos cannibal hollocaust is probably the gratest cannibal film ever made, i must say that his earlier film, jungle hollocaust is much more enjoyable. the plot isn't anything new to the cannibal genre. plane crash, people get eaten, someone escapes. the film was actually original when it first came out. what makes jungle hollocaust more enjoyable than other cannibal films is that the main charector isn't 1 dimensional. massimo foschis performance is in my opinion one of the greatest horror film performances ever. he is truly a great actor and a strong willed man. he let a bunch of dirty natives pull on his manhood. he is tortured, beaten and humiliated. the traumutizing acts he experiences transform him into a determined, powerful man, fighting to survive. all this emotional stuff aside, the film does have some juicy exploitation to go with it. the beautiful me me lai runs around naked, allowing for plenty of boob jiggling. massimos character rapes lai when she tries to run away from him. towards the end of the film she is eaten by her own cannibal tribe. massimo ends up escaping in a plane after he kills the cannibal cheif and eats his heart. a great ending to an amazing movie. im not saying you should expect citizen kane, but this movie is a masterpeice. if you don't own it allready then buy it now!!!",1163721600,3,1344,4.797413793103448
1638869,5,B00005O5D0,"A film by Ruggero Deodato (Cannibal Holocaust). A plane crashes in the jungle. One of the survivors named Robert Harper (Massimo Foschi) gets lost and while trying to find a way out of the jungle he gets captured by cannibals. He is humiliated, stripped naked, and thrown in a hole with a bird for a while. Eventually, he escapes with the help of a beautiful cannibal girl named Pulan (Me me Lai) and tries to find his plane so he can go home. This is one of my favorite cannibal movies along with Cannibal Holocaust that in my mind is the KING of all cannibal movies that lives up to its name in being the most Controversial movie ever made. Jungle Holocaust is presented for the first time in America Uncut and Unrated released by Shriek Show on DVD. The movie comes with 10 lobby cards that are Extremely detailed.

This movie is also called and is known as Cannibal Holocaust: The Beginning.

1638870,3,B00005O5D0,"I really have been disappointed by this genre.  Many movies in this genre are at the top of lists of most shocking and controversial movies.  Yet I just disagree with the standards of what made them controversial.  Most movies in this genre just bore me.

I actually thought this movie was quite entertaining and well done.

This movie is a supposedly true story which was plausible though I take it with a grain of salt.  Filipinos I know say there are 'mountain people' who are 'savage' types of people.

Anyway, the story was pretty simple about a man imprisoned by cannibals and involved a psuedo-love story with a cannibal women who he took with him when he escaped.

The gore in these types of movies is usually used for the purpose of shocking instead of a real part of the story.  I usually find the gore in these movies unsucessful and boring.

In this movie, the gore was a specific aspect of the story and thus worked well.

The story is not elaborate at all but well acted and compelling which is what is missing from other movies in this genre.",1153612800,3,1057,4.481675392670157
1638871,5,B00005O5D0,"I got this movie in a three DVD pack from a local dealer, it came along with the movies Eaten Alive and Massacre in Dinosaur Valley.  I'd have to say that all three movies were worth the $15 dollars I spent on the three-pack.  The movie, Jungle Holocaust, is an adventure movie in a different spin.  I don't really consider this a horror movie, at least in the conventional sense.  The movie is exceptionally well done in the development of cinematography, the storyline is interesting and the acting and er...scenes...are engrossing (to use a phrase).  What I would really call this is an anthropological adventure to the extreme...a civilized man placed in a totally uncivilized surroundings.  Communications are not what you would get off the local street corner, worldviews are nonexistent (at least to the tribe in this film), so there is no connection except savagery.  Maybe this movie would have a greater tie with Golding's ""Lord of the Flies.""  A fascinating movie that brings you to the heart of a world that we, especially in first world countries like the US, have forgotten about.  I would suggest ""End of the Spear"" as a Christian look at examining these prehistoric people.  That film isn't a horror film, it is a Christian film, but it is (as I am a Christian) an interesting exploration of meeting such tribal people on their own territory.",1152576000,4,1358,4.814655172413793
1638872,4,B00005O5D0,"Robert Harper is an explorer who's plane just crash landed in the jungles of Malaysia, some of his crew are killed mysteriously leaving only him and his best friend to survive as his pal disappears suddenly. Robert gets captured alive by a vicious tribe of wild cannibal people as they torture and torment him to insanity, a lovely cannibal girl helps him try to escape so he can find his friend and leave the island for good.

Entertaining, bloody and well done Italian horror adventure drama from director Ruggero Deoato who gave us the infamous ""Cannibal Holocaust"" a few years later in 1979 and this movie is sort of a prequel to that movie. It's supposedly based on a true story, the  movie features nudity and gore abound like an open chest cannibalism sequence and of course there's real live animal killing in this movie such as a Bat being strangled by a snake and a Alligator butchering scene that will remind viewers of the turtle scene in ""Cannibal Holocaust"". While not as brutal or hard to watch as ""CH"", it's still a very good cannibal epic and worth a viewing if your not faint hearted, Mei Mei Lei is quite a dish in this movie as the jungle beauty.

The Shreik Show special edition DVD has very good picture and nice sound quality with it's first time shown in it's Uncut original widescreen version.

1638873,3,B00005O5D0,"If sitting through THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST gave you sweaty palms, that experience will seem like a trip to a petting zoo compared to this stomach-churning example of Italian cannibal movies, which revel in utilizing actual footage of animal deaths. This 1977 production is one of the most extreme examples of this bizarre subgenre, as the viewer is treated to the sight of an alligator being dissected alive, a python getting his skull smashed, and other blatant animal-rights violations. (They should have had a disclaimer: ""All animals were harmed in the making of this motion picture."")

The basic premise has a hapless group of ""civilized"" people, stranded on a Philippine island, confronting a tribe of cannibals. The events that follow are not so much plot points as they are a series of shock scenes; the depiction of human sacrifices are faked, of course, but it doesn't make them any less repulsive than the scenes involving genuine animal killings.

A film like this only exists to shock an audience; on those terms, it does the job extremely well-well enough to put you off a diet of alligator, snake, and human flesh. Bon appetite!",1132358400,2,1145,4.927461139896373
1638874,5,B00005O5D0,This movie is not like the other cannibal movies because in this movie are cruel elements and love elements.

1638875,3,B00005O5D0,"Deodato's precursor to the infamous Cannibal Holocaust, this movie is one of the finer films in the cannibal movie genre.  Has everything you would expect (i.e. feasts on human flesh) and nothing you wouldn't expect (like a plot).  The film purports to be based on actual events, which I think makes the film all the more amusing.  My one critique is that the natives all looked too carefully manicured and shaven to be savages.  But this is a trivial matter.  If you're new to the genre this is a great place to begin.",1118707200,,519,4.537634408602151
1638896,4,B00005O5D0,"I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from `Jungle Holocaust', but it turned out to be really surprisingly compelling.  There certainly isn't a whole lot to this movie, but it seemed to go by in a flash, and is certainly better made than your average Italian exploitation or Horror movie.

The plot of this film is exceedingly easily summarized. 4 people, Robert, Rolf, Charlie and Swan have a problem during their landing at a secluded airstrip out in southeast asian jungles, and have to stay there over night.  It becomes readily apparent that the natives aren't so friendly, as Swan disappears in the middle of the night.  They go look for her and there are various mishaps until Robert is eventually captured and helf prisoner by the cannibal tribe.  The rest of the film is just his attempt to find the plane again, and leave.

As far as Italian stuff goes, this is very competently made.  The acting is definitely a few cuts above what you'd usually see in this sort of film.  Still, it's not as good as what you're gonna see in a major Hollywood production, of course, but it's more than good enough.  The two main protagonists, Rolf and Robert, are quite likable.  They don't have much depth, but they do engender quite a bit of sympathy simply for all the crap they go through. (Particularly Robert)  The dialogue is generally minimal and quite pefunctory, but I don't recall ever laughing at it, so it's more than sufficient.  The film is generally competently shot, though generally not with too much flare. (Other than some disorienting, wildly panning and flipping shots used occasionally, which work pretty well.)  Sadly, the camera tends to leer at the gore effects a bit too much, an always lame tactic, made worse and more jarring by the generally professional camerawork throughout the rest of the film.

The film doesn't really get going until Robert is captured, but it's all sufficiently interesting, and the film is really strangely compelling from that point on.  Why this is interesting I don't know, as not a whole helluva lot is going on at this point: The native throw stuff on him, fly him around from a rope, trap him in a crevasse, grope him and so on, and he watches them do whatever they do.  This section of the film seems to go on for 35-40 minutes, and there is virtually no dialogue, but it never gets boring, for some reason.  I'm not sure if it would hold up under repeated viewings, but it worked the first time.

The escape is actually slightly less compelling than the captivity, but it still works, and it, of course, contains most of the cannibal action.  The film really isn't all that gory, particularly if you don't count the animal stuff, but the major gore scenes are quite well done, particularly for 1977.  The major death scene, with decapitation and disembowelment is quite well done.  Still, this film isn't a true gorefest, so if that's all your looking for you may be disappointed.  Conversely, there is a ton of nudity in this movie, as much male as female, so if any of you ladies are into the `filthy savage' look this film is for you.(Though it's not all savages. Robert spends about half the film naked, and a quarter of the time just in a loin cloth, though most of the time it's shot in a way that you can't see anything. Most of the time.)

It does have a few problems.  Most notably, the animal death scenes are problematic.  I don't really care about them from a moral standpoint, they just tend to be jarring and pointless, and rather boring.  The crocodile gutting scene is pretty gross, I'll admit, but the rest of it is just tedious.  Also, the music can be inappropriate at times, particularly the theme they play during the gutting scene, which is all schmaltzy and romantic, for some reason.

That's about all I got to say.  Just a very entertaining little film.",1110326400,11,3835,4.631656804733728
1638897,4,B00005O5D0,"It's long past time for me to write up yet another review for yet another Italian grindhouse cannibal flick. Geez, I keep watching stuff like this and people are going to start thinking I'm weird--or worse. I guess I'll have to risk the averted glances and whispered warnings if I wish to see as many horror films as possible. And any surveyor of horror films will eventually make his or her way to the Italian gore epics. First, he or she will meander through the filmographies of Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci, two directors well known for their gory excursions into the realms of the gialli and the zombie genres. After a short digression into the derivative dreck of Bruno Mattei and the intriguing films of Luigi Cozzi--with a short jaunt into the world of Enzo Castellari and possibly a few of the gorier spaghetti westerns as part of the course--the viewer is ready to take a safari into the deeper, darker parts of the jungle, the jungle where Umberto Lenzi and Ruggero Deodato dwell. Welcome to ""The Man From Deep River,"" ""Cannibal Ferox"" ""Eaten Alive,"" ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" and ""The Last Cannibal World,"" aka ""Jungle Holocaust."" Get ready for a bumpy ride.

I had already seen Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust"" long before I popped ""Jungle Holocaust"" into the DVD player. The former's reputation is supreme in the field of exploitation sleaze, and rightfully so. It's a deeply sick, horrific film involving a camera crew finding much more than they bargained for during a trip into the deep jungle. In ""Jungle Holocaust,"" a few westerners once again find themselves lost in terrain unknown to civilization. This time out, it's a couple of white guys--Rolf (Ivan Rassimov) and Robert Harper (Mossimo Foschi)--accompanied by a local pilot and some native chick. The whole purpose of going into the jungle is to meet up with some oil research team camped out by the airfield, but when the plane lands our quartet finds their camp eerily empty. Too, the aircraft suffered slight damage and won't be ready to lift off for some time. While waiting for the sun to come up the female member of the quartet goes outside and promptly disappears thanks to a group of bloodthirsty cannibals. The other three don't know this yet, of course, but we do thanks to the title of the film and the description on the back of the box. It isn't too long before Rolf discovers a crude Stone Age weapon and delivers his professional opinion: cannibals ate our female crewmember. See, I told you so.

It also isn't too long before the native pilot perishes in an extremely unpleasant way (cannibals know how to make sharp traps), leaving Rolf and Robert to wander aimlessly through the jungle alone. Then Rolf waves bye bye after a raft the two men made drifts into a nasty series of rapids. Left to his own devices, poor Robert ends up in the hands of a brutal band of cannibals (finally!). The rest of the film shows us the messy trials and tribulations Harper must experience while living with a group of uncivilized man-eaters. According to ""Jungle Holocaust,"" this means tearing off all of Robert's clothes in order to dangle him high above a cave floor from a rope, imprisoning the poor guy in a crevasse, throwing rocks at him, showing a fellow cannibal devoured by ants, witnessing a native woman giving up her recently born child to a crocodile in the river, the slaughter of a live crocodile (not the same one), and a few dinner scenes. Robert escapes from the tribe and takes with him Pulan (Me Me Lai), one of the foxier cannibal girls. And what do you know? The two eventually meet up with Rolf, who survived the river disaster and has since been living in a cave with all sorts of nifty homemade devices. Robert and Rolf then head out to find the plane and escape from this godforsaken land.

It's impossible to compare ""Jungle Holocaust"" with Deodato's later ""Cannibal Holocaust."" The latter is a far nastier yet far more compelling film than this one. My main problem with this film centers on how the pace slows down to the speed of molasses once the cannibals catch Robert. Some of the stuff we see is interesting during this part of the movie, but most of it is boring and drawn out. I also don't really care about Robert's transformation from civilized man to ruthless savage since almost anyone would undergo the same process in a similar situation. What does help the film is the gore, and Deodato throws in enough of the sauce to keep the viewer on his or her toes. The crocodile scenes are bad enough, but those sequences only serve as appetizers to the main course. Yes Virginia, the cannibals do consume a few people during the film. The worst of these scenes involves the hapless Pulan when her fellow cannibals finally catch up to her. In a truly stomach churning sequence Umberto Lenzi would later steal in its entirety for his ""Eaten Alive"" film, the cannibals turn Pulan into a smorgasbord in gooey close up. It's extraordinarily difficult to watch this scene without turning a bit green around the gills, so much so that what Harper does with the cannibal chief's ticker later on pales in comparison.

Media Blasters, god bless them, gives us everything but the kitchen sink in the way of extras. A commentary with Deodato, poster stills, biographies, interviews with Foschi and Rassimov, and a batch of trailers for ""Buio Omega,"" ""Zombie Holocaust,"" ""Nights of Terror,"" and ""Eaten Alive"" intrigue the viewer long after the film concludes. For those just beginning their voyage into the cannibal genre, I recommend starting with something light like Sergio Martino's ""Slave of the Cannibal God"" before plunging into Deodato's grindcore epics.",1107820800,8,5657,4.787103377686797

1638901,5,B00005O5D0,"I'm putting Ruggero Deodato in the spotlight again. It's really a shame that he isn't as well known as Dario Argento, coz his movies really go for the throat. Ruggero seems a cut above his fellow countrymen. His films seem to lose alot of the cheese factor associated with the genre, and actually work as suspenseful movies with intriguing stories. I'm saying this with Jungle Holocaust and Cannibal Holocaust in mind. House On The Edge Of The Park, while entertaining, doesn't hold a candle to the two previous films. The Holocaust films are pretty hardcore. This one has a guy stranded in the jungle with a cannibal tribe. Simple, but it's never boring.  He teams up with a sympathetic cannibal woman who helps him escape.  You know from the start that this girl will be unique because she is A) Attractive, B)doesn't look like she belongs in National Geographic like the rest of the females, and C)has implants.  Makes you wonder how a stone age cannibal tribe gets access to implants. Others have mentioned, and I agree, that Massimo Foschi should get some kind of ""Performance Of A Lifetime"" award or something. Talk about a real trooper, he spends most of the film naked-all dirty, yucky climate, people groping him. This guy is what you'd call a dedicated actor. You think Vin Diesel would do that? Nosiree, Bob! DO NOT let Jungle Holocaust slip past you. Watch it with your wife, kids, inlaws or date. Everyone should see it.",1049760000,8,1433,4.746987951807229
1638902,5,B00005O5D0,"This is the ultimate cannibal movie. I don't mean the chomping dead or the zombie dead but the real mccoy. ""Ultimo M ondo Cannibal"" or ""Jungle Holocaust"" was filmed on location for two months in the treacherous jungles of Malaysia. There were no trick shots or stunt doubles and this incredible cast and crew experienced hardships that would never be tolerated by a Hollywood crew. Ruggero Deodato directed and produced this epic in l977 and it's been shown in thousands of different forms around the world ever since.  Media Blasters now presents its sumptuous restoration for the first time. This version really deserves the ""uncut"" status and it delivers. First of all, you get a whole set of beautifully produced poster cards depicting scenes from this treat. Then you get a commentary from the great one himself, Ruggero Deodato, and on-camera interviews with the two male leads.  This is profoundly important because you get to see the fabulous Massimo Foschi as he is today. He is the rugged, gorgeous, natural, macho Italian male lead. If possible, he looks even more magnificent today, nearly 35 years later. You get to see ALL of Massimo--from his black curls to his toes since the cannibals strip him naked early on in the movie. Thank God he stays like that through the rest of it until the end. Massimo bare naked and completely natural is one cinematic experience you'll never recover from. His performance is phenomenal as he struggles and weeps and fights to escape his cannibal captors. Today, silver has crept into his dark hair but good God, this guy is fantastic! One wishes there would be a remake with him again as the star, as Ruggero remarks in his commentary. Now, as to the commentary: our marvelous Ruggero does wander a bit. When the scene is shown where the naked native girl, played by Me Me Lai, eh, pleasures our rugged Massimo with her hand, you're dying to hear how this scene was filmed. But we have Ruggero talking about the friggin' New York subway system! In another hysterical sequence, we watch the barf-inducing sequence where the native girl has been re-captured by the cannibals. She's butchered, eviscerated, with the cannibals having a human feast. Our interviewer then casually asks Ruggero: ""Was this really the actress we see here?"" He cites the part where the dummy's heart is torn out and her entrails unraveled. Even the laid-back Ruggero is momentarily shocked by the question. ""Well, no. That isn't the real actress. It's a dummy."" I wanted to shout at the TV screen: ""Hey, maybe the idiot interviewer had a point. Because the actress vanished soon after the movie came out."" In another on-camera interview with the second male lead, Ivan Rassimov, you're relieved when it's over. This poor man is so obviously ill and aged he doesn't even remember where the movie was filmed! As he tries to remember, i.e., ""Was it Paris, the Amazon,"" I screamed: ""No, you dope, it was Malaysia! Malaysia!"" In yet another crazy incidence of reporter stupidity, the interviwer continuously asks Ruggero where the movie was filmed. Ruggero calmly repeats again and again, ""There was no studio. It was filmed all on location."" Ten minutes later, the reporter asks again: ""Was this scene shot in a Paris or a German studio."" Pause. And then Ruggero answers again. ""There was no studio. It was filmed all on location."" The photography is fantastic but the score by Ubaldo Continiello is weird. It's lush violins and woodwinds when so much of the action screams for something more modern.  You can't go wrong with this one-of-a-kind movie. Massimo recounts relentless hardships and dangers, including a very close encounter with an anaconda snake. This man is the one who should have starred in the l960s action thriller, ""Naked Prey."" As you may rememer, Cornel Wilde played the fleeing American who is stripped naked by natives and forced to depend on his wiles to survive. But the American movie faked the ""naked"" part, having Cornel wear a pair of briefs. Massimo would have played it full frontal and full rearwards naked and what an incredible hero he would have been.",1042761600,28,4105,4.886657101865136
1638903,4,B00005O5D0,"At first, I wish it will be like Cannibal Holocaust (the most sadistic movie I've ever seen, if you believe the story)as this came from the same director. But I was dissapointed by the romantic side of this 'cannibal lover'.
Though, I still can enjoy and see this as the director variation. But, if you'd like to see sadistic side of cannibalistic ritual, believe me, you'd better chasing Cannibal Holocaust...",1034553600,2,410,4.871428571428571
1638904,4,B00005O5D0,"Finally, Deodato's first cannibal epic gets a re-release in it's uncut
format - having been out of print for years ever since it's very rare mid 80's vhs release from Video City. The new DVD from Shriek Show touts ""uncut for the first time in the US!!"" which is somewhat untrue since the Video City tape was also uncut. In fact, the print on the old Video City vhs release ran 91 1/2 minutes, whereas the new DVD only runs 88 minutes (but this appears to be only due to the projection speed or NTSC/PAL difference - the DVD runs slightly faster). However, the new
DVD can be called even more ""uncut"" since it is now in widescreen. The old VHS suffered from horrible pan-and-scan which elimated important information (including in one early scene - a quick glimpse of a cannibal's face in an airplane window - completely off-screen on the old VHS even though there's an audio shock sound accompanying it). In fact, not only is there extra substantial information to the left and right of the screen, but the DVD even adds a sliver to the top and bottom! The DVD is a great looking presentation compared to the old vhs - no question.
Shriek Show delivers the goods with this release. I've heard some differing opinions on the quality of the transfer of the film, but I must say, I am totally satisfied with the job they've done here. Although not 100% perfect, the anamorphic widescreen image is crisp, colorful and sharp - and it does not suffer from any blatant artifacting or shifting.  Aside from some Very minor blotchiness in a scene near the end at the river, it looks great throughout. No complaints. Also featured on this DVD is an audio commentary by Deodato (in italian!), but if you don't speak italian you can watch the movie with the english subtitle translation of his commentary! The subtitles are mostly in the black bar underneath the lbx film so they don't really interfere with the image.
And is this commentary a hoot or what!?! Deodato keeps saying ""this is a realistic movie"",""everything is real"", ""this scene is real"", ""isn't this scene real"", ""nothing is fake"", ""everything is real"", etc. You get the idea? He also contradicts his own previous statements and claims he had nothing to do with the numerous animal torture-killing scenes and blames them all on the producer. He says the producer shot and added all of these scenes to the film afterwards to satisfy East Asian markets. But look at the alligator scene -- Deodato says the skinning part of it was shot later in Singapore with the skinners playing the cannibals - but then we cut to a long shot obviously directed by Deodato of the skinned alligator right back where the scene started.  Hmmm.  It's also funny to hear him say later that the producer died years ago - thus, the guy has no way to defend these statements and accusations himself. All quite amusing - gotta love Deodato!
Other extras on the DVD include short on-camera interviews with stars Massimo Fosche and Ivan Rassimov (looking old) plus a still/promo art gallery, a weird US trailer (as ""Last Cannibal World"") which doesn't look like a US trailer at all ... I remember the film getting a US release in my town as ""The Last Survivor"" - wish that trailer could have been
included. There are a few bonus trailers for upcoming Shriek Show releases such as ""Beyond the Darkness"" (Buried Alive), ""Nights of Terror"" (Burial Ground), ""Zombie Holocaust"" and ""Eaten Alive"". Plus, to top it all off, inside the keepcase are 10 miniature lobby cards!
So, if you're a cannibal junkie, this is one to devour. It's no ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and suffers from a somewhat simplistic script, but
there's enough grue and nudity to satisfy gorehounds and enough animal cruelty to enrage everyone else. It ain't pretty, folks, but it is one of a kind. They don't make 'em like this anymore and even though Deodato says he wants to now make ""Cannibal Holocaust 2001"" (too late ruggero!) - - don't hold your breath. This is a long-dead genre destined to stay that way. Bon appetit!",1015632000,32,4007,4.680851063829787

7948248,5,B00005O5D0,I've had this on DVD for quite some time. And what a lot of people don't understand about this film or cannibal holocaust is. That both of these films we're actually filmed on actual location. Jungle holocaust was filmed in the Malaysia rain forest and cannibal holocaust was filmedbin the actual amazon jungle. And both were filmed with real natives. Thats authenticity. Even though they're brutal bloody and violet and have footage of real life animal death's. Ruggero deodato was always known for putting the realm of realness in these two films. Umberto lenzi did it with man from deep river and cannibal Xerox. But eaten alive.. I can't say the same for that film ,1497225600,,669,4.817391304347826
7948249,1,B00005O5D0,"This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.  There is almost nothing to like or not hate about this film.  Rolf is a decent person,
 but the film is more about Robert who causes most of the problems and is not nearly as likable.  There was a great opportunity to develop a
 relationship between Robert and Me Me Lai's  character and it was missed completely.
  Yes, anyone reviewing this film had to expect that there would be violence,  but we also hoped that there would be meaning, and some
 moral triumph to this film,  when there was neither.  Ivan Russimov's acting talents were basically underused in this film and Me Me Lai's
 talent and charm were completely neglected.
  In one scene,  an unknown  woman gives birth to her baby, and then we hear a splash in the water and a crocodile comes and eats the  poor newborn child.  What would the purpose be for putting in such an unspeakably inhumane and troubling scene which had nothing to do with the storyline?
  Perhaps, that scene speaks about the film as a whole.  Troubling, distasteful, crude, without  any redeeming answers or purpose.  There
is no human interest developed here as far as the main characters are concerned.  We know nothing about the native tribe except that they
are cannibalistic, sadistic, vulgar, and anything else inhuman.
  Some movies make you think that the producer just wants to punish people for watching a film.  This is one of those movies.
  Why go through all the trouble of putting out a jungle movie  with such a horrendous story?",1437782400,,1539,4.651685393258427

7948251,1,B00005O5D0,"Im growing tired of member reviews here that straight out lie about the content of the films they review. In the case of this film several reviews talk about the constant gore and violence. Well the truth is those claims are false. As far as gore, disturbing subject matter, pure horror- Cannibal Holocaust gets a solid 10 while this film gets a 1. Honestly there is very little gore in this movie. The worst scene involves a Crocodile getting gutted, and its still not anywhere near as disturbing as the animal killings in Cannibal Holocaust. The sheer horror, gore, a pure disturbing material in Cannibal Holocaust is a thousands times more freightening and upsetting. One thing that this film was also missing was the hauntingly depressing music of the other film. The music here is pretty bland. The script here is very poor, and the acting isn't anything all that great either. The entire film is slow, boring, and ultimately a major let-down. To sum it up for you there are a few mild scenes of animals killing animals, two scenes of cannibals eating something resembling human flesh, a few very tame human killings, and a total of maybe 5 minutes of any truly disturbing gore. Add in some boring frontal nudity, one mildly R rated sex scene, and a bunch of Cannibals throwing rocks pee and raw meat at a captive and you have this film. Cannibal Holocaust on the other hand is the grandaddy of all disturbing gory horror films, this one simply fails to deliver the goods at all.",1367884800,2,1484,4.6679389312977095
7948252,3,B00005O5D0,"A pretty realistic entry in the cannibal genre, shot in the jungles of Malaysia, director Ruggero Deodao's Jungle Holocaust (aka Last Cannibal World) (1977) is a pretty chilling look at civilized man's encounter with aboriginal natives.

A plane lands deep in the jungle with a group of four aboard, the field crew they were to meet is missing, and their camp deserted.  Required repairs to the plane, forces the group to remain overnight, during which one member disappears screaming.  The pilot is killed the next day by an ingenious native trap.  The two remaining survivors, Harper (Mossimo Foschi) and Rolf (Ivan Rassimov), build a raft and take to a nearby river, only to crash on some rocks.  In the aftermath, Rolf is missing and Harper is washed up on shore, where he is soon captured by natives, and taken to their camp.  The film is very effective in capturing the abject terror of being at the mercy of a large tribe of savage natives, as Harper is taken to a huge cave, tied to a rock, stripped naked, yanked high in the air, and then imprisoned.  Harper adapts to the situation quickly, and after killing some natives with a rock, he escapes from the cave with one of the native women, played by the voluptuous Me Me Lai.  With her help, Harper is able to find sustenance, and continue his escape attempt.  Harper will find that to survive, he will descend down close to the level of his pursuers.

Apparently based on true events on the island of Mindanao, in the Philippines, the film is rather riveting, with graphic violence, nudity, rape, cannibalism, female infanticide, and human and animal butchery.  The cannibals have the preparation of human flesh, practically down to science.  Both Mossimo Foschi and Me Me Lai, who spend much of the film almost completely naked, deserve much credit for what they endured.  While the location may be realistic, some plot elements do not ring true, including an encounter with crocodiles with an unlikely result.  It may seem odd that men with no apparent survival skills, could construct a raft so quickly.  After being launched in the river, the raft changes its physical construction, because it would not float as originally built.  One might think that a machete might be quite a prize, or an airplane a source of curiosity, but the natives don't seem to have use for anything from the modern world.

This edition has some nice extras, including a commentary track by Ruggero Deodao (in Italian, but with subtitles), and interviews with Mossimo Foschi and Ivan Rassimov.  The film is also available as part of the budget priced Jungle Horrors Triple Feature, which includes the films Eaten Alive and Massacre in Dinosaur Valley.",1249171200,,2693,4.842794759825328

Unlike its sequel,Cannibal Holocaust; Jungle is more of an almost straight-forward action film,albeit with some hard-core gore scenes of mayhem.  It starts with Oilman Robert Harper seeking out some islands in the Phillipines.  Harper and his crew land the plane damaging the front wheel.  Harper and his partner,Rolf and the pilot go out to search for a woman who disapeared from the plane the night before,and they come across the woman's body as well as a huge booby trap;a swinging mace which kills the pilot. In a panic Rolf and Harper are separated.  Harper is captured by the Natives of the island,who have him being used as a kind of pet who they use as ""bait"" to catch alligators.  A native woman,Pulan feels sorry for him and helps him escape.  they make it back to the landing strip, but they have a final showdown with the tribe and Pulan is killed,and eaten but Harper manages to kill the chief (because of snake venom Rolf had put on his spear scratches his leg) and they let him go,after Harper crazily eats his victims liver and screams like a demon at them, with pieces of liver falling out of his mouth.

It's a real jungle adventure from beginning to end  with beautifully weird music.  I would give it five stars if it was possible to watch the movie without the scenes of animal killings.  The interview with the lead actor is painful to watch but worth it for the line ""That sheep's liver was my destiny"" (or something like that).  Many people skip this one and go right to Deodato's other movie in the genre, Cannibal Holocaust.  I don't really consider that a representative cannibal movie as it is more artistically disturbing and seems to have a deeper meaning about human trust.  Jungle Holocaust is just a fun movie where the cannibals really are cannibals and want to eat you for the same reason you might enjoy a well cooked leg of lamb.  They take even take the time to properly prepare and season their meals.  Buon Appetito!",1207353600,2,936,4.624242424242424

This movie is the prequel to Cannibal Holocaust, By the time Cannibal Holocaust came out Ruggero Deodato had already made a reputation for being a good trash director by the time this movie came out in 1977. Supposedly based on a true case, an explorer in the Philippine jungles gets lost after his plane with friends left and is captured by hungry cannibal tribes. He escapes by capturing a lovely tribal girl to find food and shelter if they can avoid the rest of her tribe from having them for dinner.

Exciting and realistic film about survival in the jungle filled with gory violence especially actual animal butchery. Like for example, the infamous Alligator butchering sequence that might turn you green. There's some disturbing moments like a pregnant woman who delivers her child as she throws it into a river where an alligator eats it and of course a chest being ripped open, then filled with hot coals.

Fans of this genre will love this. I guarantee it.",1200182400,4,1040,4.740331491712707
