(6.5) His Double Life (1933) - Roland Young/Lillian Gish/Montagu Love/Lumsden Hare/Lucy Beaumont",1326672000,,1205,5.823863636363637
2650136,4,B000I0QLIC,"HIS DOUBLE LIFE is an utterly charming and gentle sophisticated comedy romance starring Roland Young and the legendary Lillian Gish, the latter in a very rare female lead role in a sound motion picture.

Young stars as legendary British painter Priam Farrell who is a sheepish, anti-social recluse, unseen by even his agent despite his fame and importance. When his devoted valet Henry Leek suddenly takes ill and dies, the authorities presume the valet is in fact Farrell and the timid, colorless Young is thought to be the valet, even by his own cousin who hasn't seen him since childhood!! Young takes this as a chance to escape the bondage of his unwanted fame but unknown to him the valet has been engaged in a correspondence courtship with lovely spinster Lillian Gish.  The only photo of Leek she has is one that also pictures Young so when she meets Young she completely believes he is the valet!!  Meek Roland Young finds warm and gentle Lillian a wonderful companion and they fall in love but she doesn't believe his claim to be the real Priam Farrell so he goes along with the deception even with her.  Eventually they marry but experience financial difficulties which lead Young to anonomyously sell paintings on the side, trouble is they fall into the hands of an art expert who is certain these are works by the ""late"" Priam Farrell.

This is a very gentle comedy played to perfection by two extraordinary talented stars. And how charming to see a classic movie that centers on a lovely romance between two middle-aged players.  This is overwhelmingly Young's picture but the great Gish is wonderful too and has a truly delightful sequence involving tea with two twin priests and a rather  bewildered old gal (Lucy Beaumont) convinced Young is her long-lost husband.  The film print of this Alpha release is verygood but has it's brief bad spots and obvious film repairs like many of their releases.  Still, I was happy to see this endearing little movie.",1236729600,16,1969,4.8017751479289945
2650137,4,B000I0QLIC,"HIS DOUBLE LIFE (1933) s an interesting pre-Code comedy of errors with Roland Young that has several connections to the silent era. Co-star Lillian Gish was a favorite of D.W. Griffith. Third-billed Montagu Love was famous for playing pre-sound villains, but he was also the Roman centurion in Cecil B. DeMille's KING OF KINGS (1927).

Speaking of DeMille, his older brother William is associate director here. This father of Agnes spelled his last name with a small de and a space before Mille. He too was a renowned silent era director and scriptwriter. Prior to both brothers' film careers William wrote stageplays that Cecil acted in.

.
As for the stage, HIS DOUBLE LIFE was adapted from the play ""The Great Adventure"" which was inspired by a novel, ""Buried Alive.""

This is a story of mistaken indentity totally caused by its main character. Priam Farrel, Britain's greatest artist, is an extremely agoraphobic man. Save for gentleman's gentleman Henry Leek (an uncredited Roland Hogue) Farrel's never been seen by a soul, not even the art dealer who sells all his works for phenomenal sums.

Leek has been exchanging correspondence with lady friend Alice Chalice (Gish), a woman he's yet to meet. In his most recent letter, Leek tells Alice what hotel he and his employer will be stopping at in London before continuing on to Farrel's country home. Included is a photo of the two men inscribed ""I'm on the right.""

Leek becomes suddenly ill. Mr. Farrel gives him his dressing gown and lets Leek rest in his upstairs bed. When a doctor arrives and incorrectly assumes that Leek is the famous artist, Farrel lets it stand thinking it a neat way to avoid unwanted attention. But the unexpected happens: Leek's cold is really double pneumonia and he dies during the night.

Now the doctor, and everyone else, including Alice, who finally meets the man she thinks is Leek, is certain that Priam Farrel has died. Because Farrel's will specifies that the bulk of his estate is to pay for construction of a new art museum, his remains are interred in a very regal ceremony at Winchester Cathedral. Only the real Farrel knows that a lowly manservant is resting there under HIS name, and by telling this to others, the faux Henry Leek is dismissed as balmy....

The far inferior sound and picture quality of the Alpha DVD  of ""His Double Life"" makes a fair comparison impossible.  But I would say that in almost all respects H.M. is the better version, particularly the screenplay.  Lillian Gish and Roland Young are wonderful as the leads in H.D.L., and are more believable as a romantic couple than are Monty Woolley and Gracie Fields.  The latter are absolutely charming, and they are ""cozy"" together, but it seems more a marriage of convenience in which she has become his new valet.

The love interest is adorable and the main character is a lovable introvert seen represented more in today's media. His happiness matters by the middle of the film; that's the sign of a good picture.

The downside was the picture and sound quality. It was hard to get through the first fifteen minutes or so, but if you hang in there, it's worth it.",1401926400,3,537,4.414141414141414

2650206,4,B000I0QLIC,"British actor, Roland Young, for most of his career in motion pictures made his hay by playing supporting parts. I first saw him in 1949's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Lover/dp/B00004YS6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Lover</a>&nbsp;in which he plays a serial strangler opposite Bob Hope. He's probably best remembered as ""Cosmo Toppper"" in the 1937 comic fantasy, TOPPER (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Topper-Topper-Returns-Enhanced-Double-Feature/dp/B00008ZZ7B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Topper / Topper Returns (Enhanced Double Feature)</a>), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. 1933's HIS DOUBLE LIFE features Young in the unfamiliar role of leading man. He makes the most of it.

A bit of research - thanks, the Internet - informs that HIS DOUBLE LIFE had an earlier incarnation as a silent feature, 1921's THE GREAT ADVENTURE, with Lionel Barrymore and Doris Rankin. HIS DOUBLE LIFE, in turn, was later remade as 1943's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Holy-Matrimony/dp/B009L4DTA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Holy Matrimony</a>, starring Monty Woolley and Gracie Fields. The plot concerns Priam Farrel (Young), an acclaimed but severely anxious British artist who detests his celebrity status, who dreads hobnobbing in social circles. Farrel is such a notorious recluse that even his agent of 15 years has never met him. When Farrel's valet, Henry Leek (Roland Hogue), takes ill suddenly and expires unexpectedly, a chain of circumstances allows Farrel to swap places with him. So, there's Priam Farrel, well on his way to the peace and anonymity he's craved.

The narrative confides how a twist of fate can bring two lonely, middle-aged people together. I'm glad I stumbled onto this dusty old comedy. HIS DOUBLE LIFE generates an amiable kind of comedy, which makes sense since no one has ever associated Roland Young with the slapstick stuff. This movie is clearly Young's vehicle. And yet you cannot dismiss his leading lady. Silent screen legend Lillian Gish plays Alice, the woman with whom Farrel's valet had been corresponding thru a matrimonial bureau. Alice mistakes Farrel for his valet, they fall in love, and they marry. At some stage Farrel confesses his true identity to Alice. She doesn't believe him, of course. He's such a nervous, meek little guy.

So take note of the Leeks, living out lives of benign domesticity for who knows how many years now. They've subsisted somewhat on Alice's inherited brewery shares, but then comes a time when that financial crutch goes away. To help make ends meet, Farrel begins to paint again. But what happens when an art expert gets his mitts on these new paintings and recognizes them for what they are?

Sorry, I veered away from Lillian Gish. She's my favorite thing in this movie. She sparkles as the sensible Alice, providing the one stabilizing counter to Farrel's big sack of neuroses. At one point, a frazzled Farrel turns to her: ""Oh, Alice, your faculty for remaining calm is amazing!"" To me, the stand-out scene presents Lillian Gish at tea as, with consummate grace and wit, she disarms a potential crisis involving twin priests and their baffled mother come to claim they were Henry Meek's abandoned family. This scene alone urges me to look up Gish's other films, never mind that reading sub-titles can be a hassle. Another memorable - but more somber - sequence has Priam Farrel attending his own funeral at Westminster Abbey and being overcome with emotion. It all ends in farce, with Farrel summoned to court and taking the stand to settle the problem of his true identity and to determine whether he's a forger and a bigamist; I get it that this may be the make or break scene for viewers. Me, I was okay with the courtroom sequence. It evokes a whiff of Ernst Lubitsch in its 1930s-era daffiness and perhaps Busby Berkeley in its staged choreography, but, sadly, it's only a whiff. Mostly, I enjoyed it as a cinematic curio, and for Roland Young's rare leading role, and for Lillian Gish's all-around splendidness. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",1376179200,5,4197,5.482225656877898

I was so caught up that I was horrified for ""Farrel"" when everyone ran him off, thinking he was Farrel's gentleman's gentleman. How he thought he could live on nothing was beyond me. But then, it's a movie. Certainly can't get away with this kind of thing, or at least it would be fairly difficult.

8142882,5,B000I0QLIC,"Having just watched several documentaries on forgers, I found this movie an absolute delight!  Especially the unlearned jury attempting to determine what was real or fake, and the subjectivity of great art and the ""expertise"" of experts.  The acting was lovely, I look forward to seeing the other version ""Holy Matrimony."" It's a film that could be remade at any time and still be entertaining and relevant.

8142883,2,B000I0QLIC,"1943 Holy Matrimony (Gracie Fields, Monty Wolley), a remake, is by far the better version, and it is one of only a scant handful of movies starring Gracie Fields as well (Molly and Me also starring Wooley and a very young Roddy McDowell is the only one I have been able to locate so far).  His Double Life comes across as more of a comedy, Holy Matrimony less so, and the comedic elements in this movie are a little too cringeworthy IMO.  Young's portrayal of the reclusivity of the character, his breakdown at the funeral, and the hearing scene from his POV are so over-the-top that they make the character appear to be some sort of flaming idiot; Wooley's seem right on the money and much more realistic and get the audience believing in the character.  Both Gish and Fields do a credible job in the respective movies, as do the supporting casts, but in the end Holy Matrimony is simply more believable.  It may come down to whether the audience prefers more silliness in a comedic version or more believability in a sometimes funny drama version.",1484784000,,1049,4.593582887700535
