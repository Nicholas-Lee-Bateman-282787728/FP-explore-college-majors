8072490,5,B000A2HA9W,"Apparently these other reviewers didn't realize what they were getting into with this little gem!  My wife and I adore SANTA'S LAND in Cherokee, NC - a time capsule that has literally defied time itself.  A surreal experience that is breath of fresh air to lovers of the strange and bizarre just like this little treasure, CAMPY CHRISTMAS CURIOSITIES by passport video. Even the back cover says it all:
 MACABRE MARIONETTES, STRANGE SANTAS IN STRANGER SITUATIONS, UNSETTLING ELVES, OFFBEAT ANIMATION, LIVE MONKEYS DRESSED AS ST. NICK!  And boy does this compliation deliver!  There's foreign holiday home movies, features from the silent era, early 3 dimensional animated sets and even an appearance by Mr Sandman!  If it's the odd and rare Christmas memories from the early 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s then look no further!  In fact, I wish there were more volumes to be had but I seriously doubt material like this still exists.  I highly recommend this for historic film collectors and lovers of Christmas yore.

While I'm at it, let me also make another recommendation, the 1 DVD/CD disc set of RUDOLPH & FRIENDS CHRISTMAS FUN PACK!  The DVD features 15 strange cartoons, creepy marionettes and even foreign Christmas animation.  Its a great companion to CAMPY CHRISTMAS CURIOSITIES that like us, may become an annual household event.",1482710400,,1332,5.036529680365297
8072491,3,B000A2HA9W,"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman, The Night Before Christmas, and the California Raisins Christmas Special. When most people think of holiday movies, those are just a few examples of what probably comes to mind. Campy Christmas Curiosities seeks to erase those from your memory with a creepy montage of retro holiday movies that once seen, can never be erased from your memory.

Most of the short films are in black and white. Like all holiday movies, they set out to teach disturbing lessons to little boys and girls. For example, theres one of a Santa Claus telling two children about how even monkeys get presents from him every year if they're good. In between awkward glances from the kids staring up at a man who would probably be in an online registry today, it shoots to monkeys being dressed up, shaved by a barber, and even playing in a giant pool.

Apparently kids viewed monkeys as role models in the early nineteenth century.

Another clip on this DVD (which I found in a bin at a gas station) shows kids scurrying off to bed on Christmas Eve, only to be woken up shortly after by a creepy Santa Claus sprinkling powder on their heads. (It was probably LSD.) Like most of the other film clips, they sit on the old mans lap and listen to him talk about how toys are made by underpaid midgets that are forced to work 18-hour days while he sits at his desk and gets diabetes.

By inserting a few vintage home movie clips, Campy Christmas Curiosities reminds adults to keep the spirit alive during the holiday season. Were shown an unknown family enjoying a large meal, followed by grandma giving grandpa a strip tease as the grandkids open their presents. I found it hard to get into the holiday spirit while watching someones drunk relatives circa 1960 grinding up on each other, but thats just me.

So if you have a twisted sense of humor, 70 minutes of free time, some liquor, and-if its legal where you live-some greenery, you should absolutely watch this collection of disturbing Christmas moviesif only to say you survived.",1424649600,,2057,4.65564738292011
8072492,2,B000A2HA9W,"I agree with the reviewer 'MJ' here!  This compilation was really promoted as being something truly odd and bizarre... and really I didn't find anything in the least bit interesting about it, and some segments were just plain boring!... plus at least 3-4 segments can be found on the longer compilation ""Holiday TV Classics"" dvd set.  Unfortunately, not thinking, I didn't look at the reviews for this dvd here, and purchased it from another distributor (one learns from his mistakes!).  Regarding the 'Punch and Judy' movie... gee I found it way less 'violent' than anything kids watch on TV now!",1261958400,,597,4.95
8072493,1,B000A2HA9W,"The reason there are so many of these cheap DVDS with the same shorts over and over again is because it's public domain footage.  Anyone can copy the footage, put it on DVD and sell it.  Here we have such a schmo company not only copying other DVDs, but putting their stupid watermark on all of them.  The picture quality is so bad on everything because they are copies of copies and just thrown on the disc without care.  Their lure here was to not list any of the titles on the DVD case, but show a few photos with misleading text like ""not for the kiddies"" and ""macabre marionettes"" etc. The reason they don't list it on the DVD (they do here on Amazon, thankfully) is because they are the same shorts available elsewhere in better quality.  There is a channel on YouTube called ""XmasFlix"" that has just about every one of these from the original prints in HD.  They should make a DVD for pete's sake.  Anyway, this is the list of what I wasted my money on...

First we have a blurry copy of ""Santa In Animal Land"",  poorly transferred and they even hacked off the end abruptly.  Actually I just checked that xmasflix page and it is in fact cut off compared to theirs.

Next we have the reason most people would buy this DVD and that is for what these dolts call ""Monkeyland Christmas"".  First of all, the reason they named it that is because they hacked off all title and credits, and removed all the audio.  The actual name of the film is ""Santa Claus Story"".  They made it look like it was a silent film with generic Christmas music and intermixing text break aways like ""twas the night before christmas"".  I refer to that xmasflix channel again because they have the full version, unedited, and it is not silent.  This short is great! It's hysterical.  However, whatever they put on this DVD for this film is just unacceptable.  It was misleading to change the title.

Now we have something which does not make this a complete loss.  ""Christmas Toyshop"".  A combination of live action short with children woken up by Santa, and he tells them a story (which is the cartoon part).  There is also some ghostly special effects.  However, all of this is ruined because of that stupid watermark  on the image of ""Campy Christmas Collection"".  It's not even flush in the corner, it's in the main area of the film.  Just so ridiculous and insulting.

The we have inane home movie footage, which could be fun, but it isn't. And since there is nothing on this stupid DVD called ""Pink Girl Christmas"", this must be it as there is a family opening presents and a little girl wearing a pink dress briefly.  The lame footage is dubbed with lamer Christmas music.

Then the brilliant UB Iwerks short of ""Jack Frost"", however this transfer is far from brilliant.  I have seen this on many DVDs and this is by far the worst quality version of this great cartoon.  I'm surprised they didn't remove the audio from this too!

Now we have ""Christmas Rhapsody""  with music by Charles Henry.  This one is actually great too, making the loss slightly less annoying.  A Encyclopedia Britannica short with various Christmas carols, minor narration, and great scenic backgrounds.  However, a bad copy, and that stupid watermark .  This just means I will look for it on a real DVD after I return this.

Howdy Dooody Christmas.  Another one that is all over, however, how they managed to get a typically clear image from TV in such a blurred gritty transfer is beyond me.  The worst copy I have seen.

Santa Claus Punch and Judy... oy... picture is not horrible, but there is better. However, the audio is screwed up as it's not synchronized.  i.e. the mouths don't match the audio. Not such a problem with a puppet, but otherwise, unacceptable.

Night Before Christmas... horrible transfer.. too dark and the watermark is more prevalent with the darkness.  Better brighter and clearer DVDs out there.

Merry Christmas ... basically a montage of christmas scenes and situations... Santa's workshop... singing at the piano... christmas tree etc.  However, poor quality.  Yes, that xmasflix yt channel has the way it should look.

Ok.... ""misc. stange santa footage"" ... i.e. I found a guy in a bad santa suit talking so let's take out the audio and replace it with ""silent night"" ... literally Santa sitting and talking and pointing .... not knowing what he is saying ... and dubbed with a choir singing Silent Night... then quick cut away to Santa opening and closing an over door... the end.... seriously.

A Christmas Fantasy? ... inane footage of two kids just standing there, and a christmas tree with unrelated music overdubbed.  Footage audio removed. Cut to kids fake sleeping. Try to not look at the huge ""campy christmas"" watermark... cut to dolls on a fake skating rink.  the end.  seriously

Now, for some reason, it jumps right into the middle of the cartoon part of ""Christmas Toyshop"" as I spoke of above, and plays out.  Same exact thing.  no idea what this is supposed to be.  Maybe the make of the DVD thought that since the ""christmas fantasy""

Still have no idea what ""pink girl christmas"" is, but we are subjected to dull silent but dubbed home movie footage with a boy in pink.

This DVD is misleading, and so poorly executed. It's insulting.  Please stop making, selling and more importantly buying this DVD.  What a waste of money. Even if were a buck.",1260489600,5,5353,4.619957537154989
8072494,2,B000A2HA9W,"I own at least two dozen Christmas movies and shows and was glad to find something that was completely new to me.  I can't review this production as ""good"" (hence the 2 stars), but I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed its novelty!",1197763200,,230,4.348837209302325
8072495,2,B000A2HA9W,I really wanted this to be the most cracked out video ever. Sadly it's mostly just pretty boring. It certainly has some weird and uncomfortable moments. But you have to sit throug a lot of boring footage. There's really not much payoff.  Except Monkeys dressed as santa. And a really violent rendition of Punch and Judy that just makes you question humanity.,1169078400,3,358,4.774193548387097
8072496,3,B000A2HA9W,"Handmade puppets are the creepiest things on Earth and this X-Mas

DVD is full of em. Most of them have that over-blown dead pan expression sometimes found on the faces of serial killers or deranged clowns. The Santas (Santi/Santis) have that ""Yeah, I'm

crazy...but I'm getting paid to do this."" look. All in all this DVD is the tip of the iceberg of Campy X-Mas Curiosities out there. Most of the images were for kids but what kind of sicko parent would let their kids watch these things without suscumbing

to juvenile depression or fear of X-Mas itself.",1132272000,7,557,4.663265306122449
