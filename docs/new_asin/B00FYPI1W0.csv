Andrews Blu-ray Review: Back before the days of DreamWorks and all the other modern competitors, Disney essentially had the feature film animation market all to itself. Of course, we still got other efforts at times, a niche represented here by Don Bluths 1982 animation The Secret of NIMH.

Lifes not going well for a mild-mannered mouse named Mrs. Brisby [Elizabeth Hartman]. Her husband died recently, her son Timmy [Ian Fried] has pneumonia, and shes about to be forced to move since a tractor will demolish her home. All that, and she has to worry about attacks from Farmer Fitzgibbons [Tom Hatten] nasty cat Dragon, a critter who almost nabs her while she takes medicine to Timmy. A clumsy crow named Jeremy [Dom DeLuise] helps save her, though, and they start an unlikely friendship.

Despite her escape from Dragon, Mrs. Brisby still faces problems due to moving day. Because of his bed-ridden status, she cant move Timmy. She needs to figure out how to keep the tractor from her home, at least until Timmy recovers. A visit with a prophet called the Great Owl [John Carradine] reveals that she needs to consult with a mystical rat named Nicodemus [Derek Jacobi]. The rest of the flick follows Mrs. Brisbys escapades as she tries to save Timmy and she learns the secret possessed by the rats.

Given the very disappointing animation of Disneys late Seventies and early Eighties animated films; one would think competition would do well. That wasn't the case for NIMH, however, as it didn't draw much of an audience back in 1982. Time hasn't treated the film kindly either, as it seems just as bland and forgettable as Disneys efforts in the same era. Thats too bad, as the story presents real promise. With their special powers, the rats of NIMH should be interesting  maybe even fascinating characters. Unfortunately, the focus on Mrs. Brisby places them firmly in the background, so we never get to see much of them.

'The Secret of NIMH' moves quickly and may lose younger viewers. It also features that trademark darker aspects of many Don Bluth movies. 'The Secret of NIMH' isn't afraid of death, violence, or the odd bit of cussing. It's a grown up animated film. Most animated films nowadays won't even touch death for fear that it may scare the younger ones, and if death is ever talked about it's in broad terms. We hardly ever have to watch someone die in an animated film, here they not only die, but they're also involved in vicious sword fights to the death.

See, there's no circumventing human emotion, if by chance animals were able to gain human intellect. With that new intelligence, these animals are suddenly thrust into creating a society with rules. Some of them want to do well; others aspire to gain power through evil ways. That's what's so endearing about 'The Secret of NIMH.' It isn't afraid to discuss the more sinister impulses of humankind. Through these rats, and their actions, we witness everything from greed to compassion. Throw Mrs. Brisby into the mix and we get endless amounts of courage and sacrifice.

If there's one thing about 'The Secret of NIMH' that makes it less than perfect it's the fact that it moves far too fast. Don Bluth packs quite a lot into under 90 minutes, but it would have been nicer to have a longer story that fleshed some of these wonderful characters, like Justin and Nicodemus, out a tad more. I can't help but get choked up at the end each time I watch 'The Secret NIMH,' It's such a simple story, but it makes such a profound statement.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The Secret of NIMH appears in an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 on this Blu-ray Disc. I thought the film looked decent but rarely much better than that. Sharpness usually came across as reasonably concise and distinctive. However, a fair number of scenes looked a bit iffy. Those didn't dominate the movie, but they caused occasional distractions. No signs of jagged edges or moir effects appeared, and I also saw no problems with edge enhancement. Print flaws created concerns, however, grain looked moderately heavy at times, and the image displayed a mix of specks, spots, and marks, which were a bit too noticeable for me and were prominent enough to distract me much of the time and slightly marred my enjoyment and cannot understand why they could not with the modern computer gizmos got rid of this all those of specks, spots, and marks. For the most part, colours came across as reasonably lively and precise. Most of the hues were acceptably vibrant and dynamic. However, some tones appeared bland and murky, so inconsistency occurred; the grain was a factor, as it tended to add murk to the colours. Black levels were nicely deep and rich, but shadows seemed somewhat muddy and excessively heavy. The Secret of NIMH was never a poor image, but it lacked much sparkle and had more than a few problems. Hopefully, some sort of Anniversary edition will get a new re-master, but I'm not holding my breath.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack of The Secret of NIMH seems pretty good, especially the music, as it was composed by the brilliant and impressive Jerry Goldsmith, who sadly is no longer with us. Music demonstrates the greatest expansion, as the score offered general spread to the sides and the rear. Stereo imaging was pretty nice, as the music spread across the channels well. Effects had less to do, but they add some pep and showed decent localisation and movement. Audio quality was pretty good. Speech appeared natural and concise; only a little edginess ever marred the lines, as they usually remained distinctive. Effects appeared reasonably vivid, and they boasted nice bass during louder scenes. Music was also warm and lively. Nothing here dazzled, but the audio was more than adequate for its age. To my surprise, the DTS-HD track offered a good step up over its predecessor DVD 2.0 mix, that was a total mess, but the DTS edition is a lot clearer, better placed and involving. The Blu-rays audio was a definite improvement over its predecessor.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman: I've listened to a few tracks by the Don Bluth and Gary Goldman duo, and the collaborators are always genial and informative, still rightfully excited and proud of their creations. This track, recorded in 2007, is no exception. Don Bluth and Gary Goldman dish about the challenges of making a Disney-sized animated film on an indie-sized budget, and guide us through many of the techniques used to bring the world of NIMH to life.

Special Feature: Secrets Behind the Secret [1982] [480i] [1.37:1] [14:25] A short but detail-packed making-of documentary hosted by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, who guide us through the entire story-to-screen process.

Theatrical Trailer [1982] [480i] [1.37:1] [2.20] This the Original Theatrical Trailer for the animation film The Secret of NIMH.

Finally, it's great to finally start getting some of the Don Bluth animated classics on Blu-ray, but alas, they don't feel like they're looking or sounding the best that they could be. The video here is disappointing to say the least. A fantastically animated film like this deserves to be completely re-mastered and reworked. I'm holding out a small shred of hope that may happen at some point, but this is probably the best us Don Bluth fans are going to get for quite a long time. As much as it pains me to say it but The Secret of NIMH is arguably Don Bluth's best film and it's a must-own for animation fans. It's too bad this Blu-ray release fails to deliver a transfer worthy of the animation film, but despite this, I am so pleased to add this to my Blu-ray Collection, as this classic animation has been a big favourite of mine, especially as it is a classic Don Bluth animation that is just as good as any Walt Disney animation. But if you feel you ought to hold out for a better transfer, it is still great that it has been transfer to the Blu-ray format and despite all the mix of specks, spots, and marks, I am still pleased to own this beautiful animation that will keep all the family entertained for a very long time. Highly Recommended!
