8096295,5,B000C8STP8,"Very educational.  It contained a lot of information, but there's much more that could've been added to it.  I guess there just wasn't enough time to do so.",1378166400,,156,4.535714285714286
8096296,5,B000C8STP8,"I teach geology at a university and this is the best movie I've found on earthquakes. Production values are highest quality, professional level. This is a NOVA production with great footage, editing, writing, narration, historical overview of quakes in California, plus in-depth coverage of the Northridge quake of 1994 (?). Makes you feel like you are right there experiencing the quake and it's aftermath. Very highly recommended.",1179705600,28,432,5.462686567164179
