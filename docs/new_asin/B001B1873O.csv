8281141,1,B001B1873O,"The Alligator People with Swamp Thing and Lake Placid?! What kind of sick mind would do that?! The Alligator People suck real badly, that it doesn't deserve to be a double feature with Swamp Thing and Lake Placid! Sure, Swamp Thing had a few wired things in it, Lake Placid is awesome that I enjoy it. But The Alligator People movie is a load of crap! It's no where of being good like The Mole People! This DVD is nothing more but crappy junk!",1402012800,,443,4.285714285714286
