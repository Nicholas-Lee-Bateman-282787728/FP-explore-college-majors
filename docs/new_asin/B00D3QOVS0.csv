5772866,5,B00D3QOVS0,"I saw this movie a couple of years ago and loved it. The music is wonderful in it. There is so many songs that are so well done. This movie show what these artist when through. They cheated, got arrested, took drugs, got drunk and got beaten up. It showed the hard ships that these performers when through. This is a good movie for everyone to see.",1390953600,,348,4.208955223880597
5772867,5,B00D3QOVS0,"This movie is all about Chess Records - they call it Cadillac Records because the owner - Leonard , would give a new
Cadillac to his recording stars that were making money for him. I suppose he was kind of fair in paying them for their
work and he would take care of all their financial troubles just like a father would. These artists were all drug addicts and
drunks, always on the wrong side of the law. This included Etta James which Beyonc potraite her very well. I love to see
Beyonc singing Etta James.  There's a little bit of exaggeration in the movie, suggesting that Leonard had a fling  with
Etta James but the book by Etta James suggests otherwise. People who, also, knew them said Leonard was twice her
age at the time.  But I enjoyed the music very much.",1370736000,,769,4.363636363636363
