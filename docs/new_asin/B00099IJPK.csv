8324966,1,B00099IJPK,"This dvd was a real disappointment.  I bought it because it is the most recent one on the Pope, hoping that -since it says it is in memory of John Paul II- it will include some new footage.  But the most recent images it has are from 2003.

The buyer be aware that this dvd does not have any footage from his illness, his death, his funeral or any other recent material.  It even lacks any footage from his visit to Cuba.  The interviews are from people without any importance or relevance in his life or papacy.  There is a excess of interviews and very little historical footage.

This dvd includes a totally different program in Spanish, that has more footage, but still very bad interviews and terrible narration.  Plus the Spanish program includes the opposition of Pope John Paul II to the Irak war, something that has been erased from the English one.

Last, the price is to high for a dvd that last less than one hour.

I recommend to buy the A&E Biography of Pope John Paul II, is better in interviews, historical footage and editing.

If I could I will return this dvd and ask for my money back.",1114819200,42,1105,4.394088669950739
