8613008,1,B002RL8P1Q,"Poorest product I ever purchased. DVD inside was labeled ""Stretch Away Basketball Pain"" which alerted me right away that there was a problem. After watching for a few minutes I understood that ""strecthing"" exercises are generic exercises that relate to any sport not a particular sport such as volleyball or basketball, etc. in particular. No individual or group exercies, just computer generated images illustrating the exercise. Nothing at all like typical yoga or aerobics DVD that I desired. I note the seller has other DVD's labeled for different sports which I suspect are all just the same DVD with a different title.",1321488000,,624,5.127450980392157
