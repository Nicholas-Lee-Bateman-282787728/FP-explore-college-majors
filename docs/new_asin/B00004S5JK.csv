1346528,5,B00004S5JK,I'm a fairly good U.S. birder and really enjoyed this video. Didn't mind the silliness at all. Loved seeing all the birds found at each location. Especially enjoyed being able to bird vicariously during the night.,1420416000,,213,4.944444444444445
1346529,2,B00004S5JK,"BORING!  I really like birding, but not if I have to listen to this fella narrating.  I tried to watch it, but had to stop part way in.",1411430400,,135,3.7857142857142856
1346530,5,B00004S5JK,All of the episodes were extremely useful not only for finding good birding but also for identifying what one might see in each location.  Excellent and entertaining if not just a little too silly at times.,1378252800,3,206,4.722222222222222
1346531,5,B00004S5JK,"I am not a devoted birdwatcher at all but I was entertained by these 6 episodes and learned a few things as well.  Production values seem in line with what is on the cable TV stations these days.  The photography is very clear and the sound good but the producers wisely resist the temptation to add a bunch of show off special effects and post production work, leaving the viewer free to focus on the subject matter.  Hey National Geo...take a lesson from these DVDs!

The host is a likeable guy and makes things fun without making me feel like an idiot.",1369785600,2,555,4.411764705882353
1346532,5,B00004S5JK,"This collection of videos was very nice to watch. As a beginner birdwatcher, I was both entertained and informed about a wide range of birds.",1332633600,,141,4.68
1346533,5,B00004S5JK,"Astounding in it's scope as far as variety, knowledge, and quantity of birds. Ken Dial makes things understandable to both the beginner and expert birder.  His theatrics and sense of humor make these videos enjoyable to  even the non-birders among us.",956275200,6,251,5.097560975609756
7921708,5,B00004S5JK,I thoroughly enjoyed this video and wish there were more episodes. We have been to a some of places in the video and we have always wanted to go to Ding Darling.,1482883200,,161,4.0625
7921709,5,B00004S5JK,"This is the best Birding video I have watched in a long time.
This contains a series of shows that is both entertaining and informative.
It is divided into episodes that are easy to watch and return to watch more later.
I would suggest it for anyone and everyone who enjoys nature.
My only complaint is that there are not more episodes to watch.",1463184000,,345,4.40625
7921710,5,B00004S5JK,"Commentary voiceover is clearly spoken and easy on the ear.  As a very amateur birdwatcher, the techniques used by following an expert gave me some ideas for my next trip through the woods and sideroads in my area. The camera action is smooth and professional without the irritating bouncing and abrupt movements one too often sees in this type of video, and the scenery and birds are well worth the visual and auditory armchair trip.  I will be watching this again.",1456704000,,466,4.7407407407407405
