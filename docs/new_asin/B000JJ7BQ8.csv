8150682,5,B000JJ7BQ8,"Patriotism is alive and well as you can see in this video about the elite ceremonial units at the Marine Corps' oldest post at Marine Barracks, Washington, DC. Learn how members of the famous Silent Drill Team are  selected and go behind the scenes to see their unique practice sessions.  Video Librarian Magazine called it ""coloful, exciting, and  patriotic."" You also see the elaborate practices and performances of  the Marine Corps Drum & Bugle Corps. I watched this video with my seven  year old son and used the opportunity to explain the meaning and importance  of patriotism and service to country. I highly recommend this video to  anyone responsible for educating young people and to those who want to  learn just how dedicated the Marines are. Well done!",946425600,4,765,4.921875
