5298666,4,B009AHO0GO,"This is not the greatest version of Beauty & the Beast but my young granddaughter really likes it.  She watched it repeatedly when it was on TV so I thought I would buy it for her.  Fair price, too, to have her sit quietly and look at a video.",1379721600,,243,3.938775510204082
5298667,5,B009AHO0GO,"This film is really funny! Our favorite is the musical number ""More"" where the 3 greedy stepsisters dance around singing that they never have enough.  It is a great lesson for our kids in this age of materialism!  The animation is well done and the story is really funny with three great ghosts, and true love winning out over superficial judgements.  Great lessons for the kids and they love watching it.  Wall to wall classical music and original songs are high quality.
It is not scary which is a big plus in our house.  Our kids love it!",1377648000,2,541,4.479591836734694
5298668,1,B009AHO0GO,"I bought this movie thinking it was the disney version. When I searched for the title this was the movie that came up first. The graphic was so small on the screen that I thought it looked like the disney poster and there was no mention of what company made the film in the brief description. And I decided to buy the movie instead of rent it because of course my daughter would love to see the disney movie over and over again. So when I hit play I was really astonished. This might have been a decent movie, but I'm made I paid money for the non-disney version. I'll be a lot more careful from now on when I purchase movies via amazon.",1375574400,,637,4.145161290322581

If you just look at it for what it is its still fun. Truer to the original tale and still fun especially for little kids. Shorter then the 'disney' version so if your kid is very very young. try this.

5298787,5,B009AHO0GO,"Yesterday, I purchased this thinking that it was the Disney version.  I have never seen the Disney (or any other) version but I wanted to show Beauty and the Beast to my 3-year old twin boys.  After the video started, I quickly realized that it was not the Disney version but it was really good.  My boys loved it.  The music (Tchaikovsky's ballet pieces and songs) was outstanding, and the characters were nicely developed.  The animation was not bad either.  It was not ""over the top"", not too chatty and just perfect for 3-year old kids.  It is completely unfair to give this film one star, which many other reviewers did.  My boys wanted to watch it again today, and I was happy to sit and watch it with them.",1425513600,6,713,4.430769230769231

People  there are many books, movies, soundtracks, and audio books of Beauty and the Beast.  So all those versions have their own take.  I have many versions of Beauty and the Beast in movies, soundtracks, audio-books, books.

8538435,1,B009AHO0GO,"This is a Disney knockoff and it's probably one of the worst.

Okay, the only character to have a name in the entire movie is Beauty. I understand she's one of the main characters but they don't bother to give her father or sisters name. They also have three random ghost characters who I guess are supposed to be like Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts from the Disney version. Guess what? These characters don't have names either! This wouldn't be so annoying if it wasn't for the fact that they were in the movie constantly. They also have to be extremely annoying. They serve zero purpose.

The animation is decent but it also ends up being rather lackluster too. The backgrounds are rather dull. The music is okay but this movie also uses a lot of public domain classical music and it feels rather odd. It's distracting.

The worst part of this is the relationship between Beauty and the Beast does exist. The Beast is a jerk yet Beauty falls for him anyways. There is no build up to their romance and we don't understand why Beauty likes the Beast.

Now I know this is a kid's film but it's not a good one. If you don't want the Disney version, that's fine but you can find better re-tellings of the story. Don't buy this one. Find a better one for your kids to watch",1523318400,,1272,4.4

8538437,5,B009AHO0GO,I love it. Well done. Another nice variation on the fairy tale,1512172800,,62,4.25
8538438,3,B009AHO0GO,lets see here it was ok but I have grown up with the Disney version and I think that if this is a truer version then what is the original version of this this classic story . I think of the Disney version is more likeable because if you watch it before it tells that the Prince was to ego centered and wanted perfection and one day an old lady  came upto the castle that the old lady was wanting to come in to the castle to ask the Prince if she was beautiful and gorgeous but as we know the Prince did not think this is so when she was turned away she put a love spell on him and turn him into a beast and everyone that was in the castle was turned into something  one was a candle  others duster and mop and so on...Which ever one you watch first that is your take on it. I tend to be more on the big budget movies even big budgets movie can flop from time to time same can be said for this one I think if they were to remake this one  maybe it might be better. But I love the Disney version more So I give this 3 stars,1490918400,,1021,3.779342723004695
