2182642,4,B0006FO95G,"I saw this movie at a sneak preview with the local radio station.  I was expecting it to be funny, just based on the trailers that I'd seen, and I wasn't disappointed.  This movie struck me as being a grown up version of the goonies, with 3 childhood friends going on a treasure hunt that they never did while they were kids.  There were a few slow moments, but through most of it, I laughed out loud!",1092182400,12,401,4.181818181818182
2182643,5,B0006FO95G,"Look, I walked into this movie expecting a complete bomb, and I was being more than generous at the time. Having never heard of it before, this ""action-comedy starring that guy from Scooby-Doo and Dr. Evil's son"" seemed less than appealing to me. But once the film started rolling, I was amazed at how hilarious it was. It is a story about four childhood friends who are now in their late 20's. One of them dies and the other three set out on a childhood journey to find the treasure of DB, a man who was lost during a parachute-jump and never returned. On their journey they encounter many obstacles, including a bear, two pot-farmers, tree-hugging hippies and many other hilarities. Although the acting is not top-notch, the comedy is worth the ticket, it is so saturated with jokes that I'm sure that I missed a good third of them.",1089417600,11,834,4.566666666666666

I chose the multi format because for all the previous movies that i have purchased it means DVD and Blu ray but was sadly disappointed with this one because its only blu ray.

2182649,4,B0006FO95G,"This a cool movie that granted isn't that plausible at times, but so what? It's just a let's have fun movie. It's kind of like the Goonies, if we revisted them as guys in their 30's. If you're familiar with Seth Green, Matthew Lillard and Dax Shepard, they again play pretty much the same characters they do in most of their other films.  In this scenario all were tight childhood friends, but they've all moved away from their small town, but have come back because a fourth friend has passed away.  That guy lived life to the full, and had the previous year invited them all to catch up and do a rafting trip where they as kids thought they'd find treasure, but they all had some excuse why they couldn't be bothered.  So the three decide to do it as a tribute to him. Of course nothing goes smoothly and the trio is in peril for their lives, pretty much from as soon as they hit the river.

Besides the three on the cover, there's also other recognisable faces in this, from a couple of rednecks Ethan Suplee best known as Randy in My Name is Earl, and Abraham Benrubi best known as the Eat Now kid in Parker Lewis Can't Lose, who was in ER for a while after that.  Burt Reynolds is also in it.

It's not flawless, I didn't think the bear or the dogs were actually facial expression wise looking like they were attacking , when the plot had them doing so.  Nor are the three main guys necessarily always morally great guys (they left some other characters to be murdered at one stage) but overall this is a pretty cool film.",1499212800,,1527,4.299651567944251

When I put the disc in it pulls up a 13 second commercial about the movie being in HD. Once the commercial is over the screen turns black. And stays like that. It doesn't let you pull up the menu or skip to the next commercial it's just black. They we're nice and sent me another one and the NEW DISC DID THE SAME THING ! And now I can't get a refund OR get a new one. If I return them I have to pay for both ????? This is stupid and DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE !!!!,1466899200,2,590,3.6535433070866143

2182711,3,B0006FO95G,"""Without a Paddle"" (2004) is a comedy/adventure about three old friends who fulfill a childhood pact by venturing into the Northwest wilderness to solve the mystery of D.B. Cooper, an unidentified man who hijacked an airplane in 1971 and parachuted out with a large sum of money. Will they solve the mystery? Will they even get back alive?

I remember seeing the trailer at the time and was really excited about seeing this film because I love lost-in-the-woods type adventures, but I was somewhat disappointed. I've seen it twice since then and liked it better than my first viewing, but it's still far from great. It's basically just a fun adventure flick with various lost-in-the-woods shenanigans.

It starts off pretty good and gets lame in the mid-section, but the final act is decent. I appreciated the camaraderie of the three friends (Seth Green, Matthew Lillard and Dax Shepard), the hip soundtrack, the excellent guest appearance of Burt Reynolds and the awesome New Zealand locations. The two hippie chicks in the woods aren't anything to get too excited about, but that's a matter of taste. It's worth checking out if you like adventure-in-the-woods flicks.

The film runs 95 minutes.

The movie is about 3 friends for have grown apart but reconnect to fulfill a childhood dream.  The storyline is cute.  I purchased this movie after seeing it on DVD because it's one of those movies you could watch time and time again for a good laugh.  It has some great songs in the movie and reminds you of your own childhood when life was much simpler.  I wasn't excepting anything good out of this movie the first time I watched it, but I was happily surprised.  They aren't any sex scenes, just innuendos.  That's most movies these days.  So I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 13 who needs to laugh.  Enjoy!",1424476800,,804,4.162337662337662

The movie is fairly fresh since the stereotypes the writers poke fun at are ignored for the most part by...hollywood cinema.  The themes and plot is positive and refreshing.

2182808,5,B0006FO95G,"Without A Paddle is a comedy film starring Seth Green(Family Guy, Robot Chicken). The film involves three friends who found a treasure map left behind by their late buddy, so they decided to head out to Oregon to find the money. But they quickly encounter illegal marijuana farmers, beautiful but strange hippie chicks and an amorous bear. Burt Reynolds also stars as a crusty mountain man who relucantly befriends the three heroes. My favorite parts of the movie is the guys must huddle together to stay warm and as they start huddling, R. Kelly's Bump and Grind start playing, kind of gives a suggestive humour moment there, and there's a part where Seth Green is ready to give one of the hippie girls a leg massage and she raises her skirt revealing her very hairy leg, that had me laughing hysterically.

2182828,3,B0006FO95G,"Three friends; Tom (Dax Shepard), Jerry (Matthew Lillard), and Dan (Seth Green), come together after the death of one of their closest childhood friends, Billy. Billy had been obsessed with uncovering nearly $200,000 that famed highjacker D.B. Cooper (an actual real life criminal) supposedly hid somewhere in the wood of Oregon.  Partly out of adventure and partly as a final farewell gesture to Billy, the three young men leave for a multi-day canoeing trip down the Colombia River to see if they can find the object (the money) of Billy's obsession.  The river turns out to be the least of the men's worries as they encounter one strange encounter after another: illegal DELIVERANCE-type pot farmers, an angry sheriff, giant black bears, environment-loving tree-living women, and one expert woodsman who looks an awful lot like Burt Reynolds.

When I first watched WITHOUT A PADDLE, I didn't think I was going to like it.  I like Matthew Lillard and Seth Green, but wasn't a big fan of Dax Shepard.  The plot didn't sound all that good to me and I was concerned with some of the content warnings.  Surprisingly, WITHOUT A PADDLE wasn't too bad of a movie.  Yes, there is pot smoking done for comic affect.  Yes, there is sexual innuendo.  Yes, there are a lot of crude jokes.  And yes, once the movie gets started much of it is nonsensical and seems like something out of a Benny Hill sketch or a Monty Python movie.  But, I actually enjoyed the movie.  It made me laugh and after I finished it I realized that I had a good time.

Some of this might be due to the set up of the film.  The introductory backstory about the characters and their friendship growing up does a wonderful job making the audience care about the characters and setting up the rest of the picture.  When the movie turns into a Bizzaro World version of STAND BY ME, things don't seem as insane as they should.  The pacing of the movie also helps.  There are times the film could drag, but it never does.  The characters have a purpose and they will fulfill that purpose even if it kills them.  Once the boys leave for their trip it's one exciting and often humorous event after another.

WITHOUT A PADDLE isn't a movie for children, which is a shame.  If some of the content would have been toned down a bit, it would have been a movie that most family members could enjoy.  Nevertheless, it is a good movie that teenagers on up can enjoy if they just give it a chance.",1169596800,3,2445,4.546910755148741

I love comedies, from the classics (Some Like It Hot) to the greats (Holy Grail) to the dumb-but-funny (Saving Silverman, Zoolander, The Hot Chick). But I don't love this. Not funny. Poorly made. Totally formula.

When the characters are as fake as comic strip characters, you're in trouble. When the the audience can predict everything that happens next, you're in big trouble. And when you're 25 minutes into a 'comedy' and you've laughed only twice, you're in huge trouble.",1159574400,,505,4.929411764705883

After seeing it, I can say that some will like it and some won't. The story is a good setup for the adventure they have, jokes are there, but it kind of gets old by the end of the film. The acting was decent for this genre and the scenery for the film was beautiful. From waterfalls to green forrests, it's definitely something to see. The only problems I had with the film are that the villains are kind of lame, two country boys trying to kill the three because Seth and his friends find out that the country boys are growing Mary Jane (And I don't mean Peter Parker's friend). The other problem was that the ending was predictable. With all of that said, it's not a bad movie.",1144108800,3,790,4.169934640522876

This was fun. Not deep, kinda silly, but I laughed out loud several times, and that is good enough for me.

3 best friends go on a treasure hunt out in the beautiful North West, meeting up with a bear, a couple motley pot growers(Abe Benrubi from ER, and Ethan Suplee, from The Butterfly Effect) and a real mountain man, Burt Reynolds.

The money is what they're after, but they find more. Friendship, life, and true values, amongst other things.

My sweetheart, Norman and I snuggled on the sofa and watched this while eating leftover salmon. Was nice to relax, no swearing or nudity - so it's OK for the kidlets. Probably not wee kids, but, over 10 or 12.

2182865,3,B0006FO95G,"Mix the premise of `City Slickers' with the silliness of any recent Hollywood comedies released for summer season, and then you get `Without a Paddle.' The story is awfully predictable, the gags are not so funny, and most curiously there's no chemistry between three actors (each talented though), but `Without a Paddle' remains a passable comedy throughout thanks to the genuinely likable characters.

`Without a Paddle' is a kind of comedy of which content you can tell by looking at its story, cast, poster, 2 minute trailer, and the title. Matthew Lilard, Seth Green, and Dax Shepard go to the mountains in order to find the treasure (or stolen money) supposedly hidden by a famed thief one D. B. Cooper. There is canoeing, close encountering with a bear, meeting with two hippie women, etc. all indicating nothing original during the course of about 100 minutes. There is even a `Those were the days' section using home video clips trying to give pathos, and the filmmakers are brave enough to even add a `meaning of life' message to the comedy with the appearance of Burt Reynolds, who appears with a thick beard.

For all its uninspired script and direction, the film has good moments due to the cast. Seth Green, who perfectly knows the right timing to be funny, proves again that he can do great comic turn without making it too silly. Lilard (unusually subdued for him) is also good, and so is newcomer Dax Shepard. But for all good works from each of them, the three characters as a whole do not convince me as three old friends since childhood. The story about their friendship falls flat, which only help make the lack of originality in the film's numerous gags - jokes about pot, homosexuality, or toilet humor and so on - more obvious than otherwise.

But I liked the three characters, not because of themselves or what they do, but because of the actors playing them. They and their acting leave no nasty taste in your mouth after watching this comedy, and that is not a bad thing at all. The film somehow refuses to be wild when it should be, and the actors look as if waiting for the cue to be wild, which never comes after all But it is still true that they did professional's jobs, all Green, Lilard, and Shepard, and to watch them is not a bad idea for me. If only director Steven Brill (`Little Nicky' 'Mr. Deeds' and others) had given them a chance to do something different.",1134000000,,2398,4.611241217798595
2182866,1,B0006FO95G,"I'll admit, the way they set the trailors and teasers up for this movie, it seemed like a great thing.  Opening weekend came along, bought my tickets, bought a Dr. Pepper and some candy, sat down, got severly disappointed, me and my girlfriend left wondering if we could ever get that two hours back.

The movie is about 4, well 3 because 1 dies, friends who have this emphatuation with some stolen money that was lost a looooong time ago.

As I stated above, one of the friends dies, and after they mock his death at the funeral they find his stash of goodies that will lead them straight to the lost money.  So, after some bickering, they go out in search of the money.

There are three types of characters, 1)regular joe with relationship problems that ""needs to find himself"", 2)typical ""whitey"" that's scared of everthing he touches, and 3)the ""bad ass"" of the group.  All of which could have made a great movie, but were played so terribly that I found myself hoping they fell of a cliff... or maybe the bear would eat them!!

Anyways, they do a whole bunch of cliche stuff, typical ""college humor"" type things.  Find women, want to sleep with women, woman has hairy legs.  Cop is polite, bad ass is not, cop gets rude, bad ass is.... over doing it.

I can't really find words to describe this movie other than to say ""It was once a shining ball of opportunity, but it got sucked down the toilet with the acting, the scripting, and the money I paid to see it.""

B. Cooper's long lost treasure.  Once in the wilderness, they encounter a ferocious grizzly bear, a couple of tree-hugging (and tree-dwelling) nymphets, and two hillbilly pot farmers who look and act like a couple of leftovers from a touring company of ""Deliverance.""

Dax Shepard, Matthew Lillard and Seth Green play the young men who spend most of their time rescuing one another from death-defying accidents or running for their lives from predatory man and beast - with the occasional time out for big-think observations around the campfire about freedom vs. responsibility, about overcoming fears and about just how much adventure a person should have in his life.  ""Without a Paddle"" feels an awful lot like similar lowbrow comedies from the past, but its overall fast pace and good-natured silliness give it an endearing quality.  The stunt work is impressive and, although the movie is far from being a laugh-riot, the viewer is sure to get a few chuckles watching these city slickers taking on the rigors and trials of the great outdoors.  ""Without a Paddle"" works if you're in the mood for mindless relaxation.",1130630400,,1321,4.986363636363636

I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I'm just saying to understand them you would have had to experience those type of people. Having lived in Oregon for two years with my daughter we got quite a kick out of the movie. Even though the movie was filmed in New Zealand it made you feel like you really were in Oregon.

2182892,3,B0006FO95G,"All too often is there an abundance of serious, straight-faced films that are released at an almost constant pace in theaters. Then every once in a while the proverbial ""ugly duckling""comes around and opens everyones eyes. Without A Paddle is a little of both of those. While it is anything but a monumental smash hit, it opened a lot of peoples eyes and did quite well for what it had to work with. Aside from Seth Green and Matthew Lillard, Without A Paddle really didn't have much going for it. In a nutshell it's basically your typical comedy. This means that it will include some gross-out humor, rednecks, and a huge amount of drug and ""downstairs"" references. Or at least that's what this film brings to the table. Without A Paddle is about four men (Tom, Dan, Billy, and Jerry) who, as children, were very troublesome and adventurous. This led them into their mid-twenties where Billy had to separate from the seemingly inseparable group to pursue other goals in life. What follows is the untimely death of Billy, and what could have been the demise of the rest of the gang. But instead, the remaining three become closer than ever before and, following directions from a map Billy left before he croaked, go on a final adventure. This journey consists of finding the hidden treasure of D.B. Cooper which had eluded the boys since early age. It all begins here as they set off while reminiscing about childhood, Culture Club, and mix tapes.

As for more info on who Tom, Dan, and Jerry are... Dan, played by the awesome Seth Green, was the doctor that was worried and paranoid about being diseased. He also had a lot of phobias, which I found to be comedic considering that he was a doctor and most doctors have very few (if any) fears when it comes to health. Then there was Jerry. Matthew Lillard did a good job as Jerry, in my opinion. Jerry was basically a yuppie-like businessman with an unhappy life. He also had a girlfriend who he was too afraid to propose to. Tom, the third and final character, was played by Dax Shepard. Tom was, overall, a very good liar. He tended to stretch the truth more than was necessary, or he just flat-out lied. For instance, rather than having earned money off of selling prized Harley Davidson motorcycles, in reality he actually sold off several of his friends band t-shirts on eBay. So in short, the brief cast of characters in the flick were interesting enough, even though I would have preferred a bit more depth for each of them. I did like what Seth Green did for his character though. I couldn't have imagined a better actor casted for such a role.

I actually liked Without A Paddle quite a lot for a standard Friday evening comedy. It's distantness and comedy were aimed at a much younger audience that I expected; teenagers will definitely like this one the most. Especially with the repetitive talk of women's ""downstairs"" and several scenes that include Tom, Dan, and Jerry escaping two of the villains in a field of weed. The humor is intended to be immature, but at times it can be very funny. Then again, there are some scenes that either take it too far or just go off the edge with ridiculousness. For example, the part where the three wander into a tree of two ""forest girls"" who appear to be lesbians is a little too much. In my opinion, the first half of the flick was much better than the final half. Actually, the beginning turned out to be very well-scripted and thought out. I liked the inclusion of the mix tapes and vintage posters. The opening childhood scene was neat, especially with the awesome music. If there's one thing that I liked in the movie, it was all of the music. The backgrounds and scenery kind of got tiring and boring after a while. It seemed like the guys fell off nineteen of the same waterfall. There was little to no variety when it came to the setting. I would have liked for the most to take place elsewhere, maybe in, say, the desert. That would have made for some good comedy, but would of been a surefire rip-off of that old Pauly Shore movie. Overall, Without A Paddle is for the younger audience. I wouldn't recommend it to small children for several reasons. One, some of the language is inappropriate. And two, the fact that drugs are in the movie is a no-no. Other than that, if you think your kid is ready for that, then by all means let them watch this. I only recommend Without A Paddle to anyone looking for a couple good, non-serious chuckles. Other than that, this film doesn't really provide much else.",1121472000,,4516,4.553505535055351

However, despite some chuckles and a few laugh out loud moments and some pretty good acting, the movie was just boring.  It had a slow pace to it and some storylines were drawn out way too long for little effect.  I liked the actors, the music, the setting and the story but I was bored with the presentation.  Not sure what could have spiced it up, either.

As for the DVD, there are some nice extras on it, including a making of featurette and a ""video commentary"" where the director and the three main actors are shown in a Picture-In-Picture screen in addition to just commenting on the film.

It's actually a decently-written, sweet, and heart-warming film about friendship and other lessons of life, delivered in a pretty smart way. It's well-paced and has some great characters, especially the two pot-farming baddies, who are hilarious, because of the better-than-average writing you might expect for such a movie.

Ah, yes, the script. I was trying to make a comparison while watching it. I'm sure I'll miss a good example, but here is a list of movies whose writing was far worse: Batman (ALL of 'em). Catwoman. Godzilla. Blade: Trinity. Elektra. Any of the new Star Wars episodes. The Day After Tomorrow. Chronicles of Riddick. Aliens 4. ...

As I was saying, the humor and script were more subtle and funny than, say, your average National Lampoon, though not quite to the level of Clueless, and the characters were endearing enough. More proof that I'm not yet one of the highbrow movie elite, I guess.",1114819200,10,1005,4.970238095238095

Of course, the tree-hugging girls and fat rednecks they meet are the basest of stereotypes, but overall it was actually funny - rather than the disgusting sequence of jokes about bodily functions I expected.

It was a rental, but I will be buying this for my collection for future viewings, even with the obligatory ""I told you so's"" from my husband.

The story of three not-quite-grown men going on a treasure hunt their belated friend had planned for them before his death is original.  It was intersting to see that though all three men matured significantly by the end of the movie, they did so in very different ways.  The scene with the bear (I believe on the DVD it is ""a Cub's Life"") was the funniest scene in the movie.

2182904,4,B0006FO95G,"Without a Paddle really doesn't do much to distinguish itself from other films of its kind, wherein the main characters take off on a comically hairy adventure in order to recapture their youth and end up figuring out the kind of adults they want to be in the process, but it does play out pretty well.  There are laughs to be had throughout the film, the underlying story holds together satisfactorily, the lush wilderness setting makes for a vivid backdrop, and I felt pretty entertained by the time all was said and done.  On the negative side, the film does rely on a number of hackneyed storylines, such as the ubiquitous ignorant locals who chase the main characters all over the woods, and the big life-changing realizations of each character ring a little hollow in the end.

Some people say the film should appeal mainly to teenagers, but I'm not so sure of that.  Those of us who came of age in the 1980s love every chance we get to reminisce about our good old days, and this movie takes us back to those days of Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, 80s music, etc.  Without a Paddle also doesn't descend to the level of crudity that today's teens may have come to expect from their comedies.  Sure, the movie takes the low road every once and again, but it soon works its way back to middle ground - there's basically no nudity, relatively little cursing, and even the human waste product shtick (seemingly required by law in everything coming out of Hollywood these days) is somewhat sanitized here.

I liked the setup of the story, with its link to the mystery of D.B. Cooper.  I know I was fascinated as a kid by the Cooper story, but I doubt that many young people today have ever heard of the guy.  For the record, Cooper stole a bunch of money, made his escape by parachuting out of a plane, and proceeded to vanish into thin air; no one knows what happened to him or to the stolen money.  This is exactly the kind of treasure hunt I dreamed of as a kid, so it makes perfect sense to me that this group of thirty-year-old friends would set out in search of Cooper.  They make the trip in honor of the fourth member of their childhood foursome, after bidding him farewell at a pretty disrespectful funeral.  It's certainly the adventure of a lifetime, complete with a whitewater washout, a very close encounter with a bear, a meeting with two modern-day flower children living high up in a tree, the aforementioned hostile locals, and a very grizzly Burt Reynolds.  You might expect Seth Green to stand out from his fellow actors, but it is really Dax Shepard who supplies most of the comic energy of the film.  Without a Paddle isn't really a cinematic trip you won't to take twice, but it does make for a pretty entertaining ninety-minute diversion from real life.",1113609600,2,2782,4.51593625498008

City Slickers 1 and 2 covered this ground once before, but frankly, I liked Without a Paddle more.  It's sentimental for all the right reasons.  The boys truly love each other and when they become twenty something's, they retain some of their boyish quirks, each with a flaw, the short, picked-on boy grows up to be the short picked on doctor.  You get the idea.

The Cascade Mountains both real and simulated is a beautiful green backdrop to the slapstick antics of angry bears and pot growing dummies.  The tree girls are a breakdown and laugh idea.

But after a starting along this path it veers off into so many different areas that in the end, none of them have enough meat on the bones to fill you up and it becomes a fairly shallow film.  Not bad mind you, but certainly not great either.

Dan (Seth Green), Jerry (Matthew Liiard) and Tom (Dax Shepard) are three boyhood chums, now all in their early 30's who reunited in Oregon for the funeral of their friend Billy.  When they were just kids, they had always planned on taking a trip to search for the legendary lost treasure of D.B. Cooper.  When the trio revisits their old tree house...Incredibly still intact after 20 years, those desires are rekindled, and they decide to honor the memory of their friend by setting out on the journey.

At this point the film is holding true to the funny but fairly sophomoric humor and doesn't work too badly as they have a harrowing encounter with a motherly bear who (stupidly) mistakes Seth Green as her cub.  Then the group take the wrong fork in a river and survive the harsh rapids and our left without their boat or supplies.  This is where the film begins to fall apart.

Wandering the woods they come upon some lights hoping for help only to run into some backwoods Oregon hillbillies who are running a major marijuana growing operation.  On the run from the gun-toting, ATV-driving rednecks, Without a Paddle now wants to become a coming of age film about three aimless thirty-year olds, while also making a stupid comment about preserving the environment as they take refuge in a giant redwood shared by two beautiful, and near-naked hippies.

Without a Paddle ends up being sort of ""Goonies"" for the 2000's although it's not nearly as fun as that film.  Director Steven Brill had shown some ability with previous decent efforts with the Adam Sandler films ""Mr. Deeds"" and ""Little Nicky"" but he falls a bit flat on this one.

2182954,5,B0006FO95G,"I went to see this movie thinking it was going to be funny. I was right! This movie had me laughing all the way through, from the bear attack to the weed farm to the Earth-child tree house, this movie lived up to my expectations and then some.

When their friend Billy dies on one of his many adventures, Jerry, Tom, and Dan go back to Oregon and encounter their old tree house with all their childhood memorabilia. They find a box with relics they put in that was not supposed to be removed until they found DB Cooper's treasure. Supposedly he parachuted into the woods with a bunch of stolen cash but was never seen since. Billy had even marked out the trip on a map and had wanted to go with the guys on a camping trip the previous summer, but none of them could make it. Tom was detained in Mexico. So, to honor their friend, and despite Dan's ""I'm Dr. Mott now!"" objection, the three decide to follow Billy's map and finally search for DB's treasure.

The trip starts out with a pit stop in a very run-down town. Using Dan's satellite cell phone, Jerry runs into some trouble with his girlfriend, who is tired of waiting for him to settle down. Once they barely escape from a shariff with no teeth, it's off into the woods to christen a red canoe, much to a Native American's dismay. ""Thanks for breaking glass where my kids play."" Smoothe, Jerry, whose response was, ""...oh.""

When they finally land for the night, things go fine until Tom decides he wants to fish by ""flashing them"". Dan bets $1000 and his left, well, anyway, he bets he can't do it. The first fish Jerry and Dan forget to catch out of stupidity, but the second was out of fear of the bear that Tom doesn't notice until Jerry starts taking off his shoes.
""You can't outrun that bear.""
""I don't have to outrun the bear. I just have to outrun you."" Dan trips while running and Tom suggests the fetile position. The bear then takes him for a cub and carries him off. ""ABORT THE FETILE POSITION!"" Hey, how many chances do you have to try freshly caught...what was it? A raccoon? Well, that night was spent in a tree and Dan's brand new cell phone becomes a tasty snack.

The next day the bear is scared off by explosion sounds and the trio sees a boat with two ugly rednecks in it throwing grenades into the water. Dan wants to cut through the woods and start out on the other side. When they do, they miss the fork and end up on the wrong side of it. Although Tom made himself out to be a Class-45 river rafter, they don't have much luck and end up sailing over a 100-foot waterfall. Now they don't have a canoe or a map, which the bear had clawed through anyway.

They set off into the woods and come across civilization and Creed wafting through the air. However, when they get close enough, they find the same two rednecks they were trying to avoid earlier talking to beheaded fish. They hide in their shed which is stuffed with packages of grade-A marijuana. One wrong move and dogs Lynyrd and Skynyrd are on their tail. So after setting off the flares that light up the entire marijuana field, which ultimately sets the field on FIRE, Tom, Jerry, and Dano take off. Half-way through, everyone is completely stoned. They manage to escape, though. So...onward into the woods.

Earth-child. No, not just any old hippie. A tree. The soaked guys, after swearing they aren't from the logging company, ""If you're from the logging company you'll have to speak to our lawyers!"", are allowed to come up and meet Flower and Butterfly. Slug (Jerry) and Condor (Dano) are immediately embraced (what was Tom called again?) and they discover just how ""natural"" the two girls really are. They try to radio for help, but the signal is intercepted by the rednecks who are after them. When they try to cut down Earth-child, Tom, Dano, and Jerry make a run for it in nothing but their underwear. (Butterfly and Flower were drying their clothes off, in case you were wondering.) Even though flying bags of, well, (what would you use the ""little tree's room"" for?) are thrown on their heads, the rednecks don't give up on Earth-child until Tom rides off with one of their wheelies and ends up driving it off a cliff. Surviving the drop, Tom, Jerry, and Dano escape into the woods again, and this time, Dano finally gets a kiss farewell. (Flower is the hairy woman of his dreams!)

Now it's dark and cold. Dano is tired and they're in front of a cave. Once you hear the lyrics, ""My mind's telling me no, but my body...my body's tellin me yes"", you know it's going to go a little crazy. Hey, it's cold! And as Tom said, ""This never leaves the cave."" After Jabba leaves his hut because Jerry can't keep his exotic thoughts in his head (poor Dano, it's not his fault), the scary mountain man Del Knox shows up and leads them back to his cabin.

He doesn't kill them, but he does tell them that he was DB Cooper's best friend. He spent 30 years up in those mountains. He couldn't leave. The next morning comes along. Dano wakes up.
Dano: Mmm...bacon.
Del: Squirrel.
Dano: Mmm...squirrel.
The rednecks can't read for anything, but they can track, and sure enough, after Jerry finds the eaten cell phone (does a bear -poop- in the woods?), they catch up to them. Del takes care of them temporarily so Tom, Jerry, and Dano can escape.

The compass isn't working. The iron in the mines is throwing it off. Revelation! If it's throwing their compass off, it must've thrown DB Cooper's compass off! Next thing they know, they've fallen through a mine shaft. And...da da da DA...there they come face-to-face with none other than DB Cooper himself...well, what's left of him. After burning his treasure to stay alive for a few more hours, he froze to death. Their mission complete, they get their relics back (a C3PO collectible, a rookie card, and a rubber -good going Tom-) and decide to place it with DB Cooper and his treasure. Then the rednecks show up...again. Dano slipped through a hole in the shaft to freedom with the help of singing a ""Culture Club"" song. He then knocks the two trouble-makers into the hole with Jerry and Tom. A fight ensues. Dano picks up a grenade that was dropped. The same sheriff from town shows up. Problem solved, right? WRONG!

The rednecks work for the sheriff and all guns are pointed at Jerry, Tom, and Dano. Once Jerry is given possession of the grenade, he gives the three thugs a choice:
Jerry: I've decided my life's worth living. And if you decide that your lives are worth living (actual dialogue may vary), you'll put your guns down.
Sheriff: And if we don't?
Jerry: (pulls grenade) Bye-bye, boys.
The grenade hits a tree and the three thugs are caught under it. Back in town (not the run-down town but Jerry, Tom, and Dano's hometown) the thugs are arrested and Del gives the guys a little surprise: DB's parachute. He has DB's bones in his backpack and plans to see the world.
Del: Maybe even Washington.
Jerry:...wow...one state.
Inside the parachute is Del's share of the treasure: $100,000 I think it was. Jerry doesn't want it. Dano doesn't want it. (Hell, he's ""Dr. Mott"" now!) so Tom, who isn't the Harley salesman he claimed to be, uses it to pay off his debts.

In the end:

Jerry asks his girlfriend to marry him and she says yes.
Dano and Flower share an intimate moment in Earth-child.
Tom confuses a bunch of boyscouts at a camp fire.
The movie ends leaving you with only one burning question:

""What's a 'downstairs'?""

2182955,3,B0006FO95G,"I was very surprised by this film.  It was not this exceptionally funny film that will be remembered forever, nor was it this pre-teen comedy that prided itself on sexual humor and bathroom jokes, but instead a solid comedy about friends and their tribulations in the forest.  The comedy in this film was strong, providing some very funny moments and some humorous lines provided by actors that seemed genuinely interested in making this film.  There seemed to be a strong connection between our three actors as they played off each other exceptionally well.  What really impressed me about this film was not just the sporadic comedy that was top-notch when applied well, but also the story.  You don't see stories like this as often as you would like.  The 80s were classic for bringing a group of actors together to fight the elements of nature, but lately it seems that sex and drugs sell stronger.  While there was plenty of this in Without a Paddle, it wasn't the major theme.  The powers of friendship, the influences that it has on your life, and the effects of maturity when in a hostile environment were all major elements to this film.  It was like The Great Outdoors meets The Goonies created in 2004.  This is not a bad little combination that, despite the enormous pitfalls in the story line, played quite decent.

The actors in this film were not comedy genius', but the did know how to make you laugh and that worked for me.  Seth Green was the standout performer in this film as his character provided some of the wittiest lines as well as hysterical physical humor throughout the film.  Green did a fantastic job with Mott, giving him not only several layers, but also this genuine feel of friendship.  That is what impressed me the most with Seth Green, Matthew Lillard, and Dax Shepard, they seemed genuine in their delivery.  Nothing seemed forced or to controlling with these guys.  Their ability to deliver some very funny lines while trying to keep a jigsaw puzzle of a story together was a great accomplishment.  Without the incredibly perfect casting in this film, I do believe it would not have worked.  Green's delivery, Lillard's emotion, and Shepard's physical humor embodied the core elements of comedy for this film.  They each carried Without a Paddle on their shoulders and with pride.  Also, I have to give credit to the supporting cast as well.  Burt Reynolds did a great job as the little guy that helps this band of yuppies to their final destination, as well as Ethan Suplee and Abraham Benrubi who were perfectly cast as the rednecks of the woods.  While Deliverance was a running gag throughout the film, I thought that these actors created something unique and worthwhile on their own.  The recreated a dying genre of wooded comedy and while they did not create perfection, they did a great job trying.

Sadly, the actors couldn't do everything.  The gaping plot holes created by Fred Wolf and Harris Goldberg were devastating.  It literally ripped this film to shreds.  The ability to get from point A to point B seemed to be a challenge for the writers of this film.  While they were able to pull it off in the end, you could tell that they were having some trouble.  There just seemed to be too many ""What the ..."" combined with ""Whosa what..."" to make the story stand on its own.  With the help of MTV, they were able to cover some up by using songs from the 80s to divert us into a new direction.  For me, it just didn't cut it.  The ending was laughable, and not in the comedy sense, but in the ""the writers had to wrap this up quickly"" sense.  This was my biggest problem with this film was the story.  It felt as if there was too much ground to cover and not enough time to do so.  Maybe it was the final editing, but you finished this film feeling like you missed a big chunk of the action.

Overall, this was a decent little movie that had me laughing at some parts while waiting for others to end.  Seth Green fans will be highly impressed with his role in this film and definitely show that he needs to continue to get more work to improve this great gift.  The comedy delivered by the actors is a great blend of 80s humor without the sex and drug jokes.  I felt I wasn't being demeaned or my intelligence squandered on this film, but instead it kind of made me think of my youth and friends.  The story was, in all honesty, horrible.  I don't think the writers had a good grip on this film and therefore it suffered.  For those interested in seeing this film, I think the acting is worth checking out, but the story could have been tweaked a couple more times.  Not bad, but very far from perfection.

2182956,3,B0006FO95G,"""Without a Paddle"" is a comedy that is unlikely to evoke huge laughs out of anyone over the age of 12. Nevertheless, I found myself enjoying the rather shallow but still entertaining story of three guys who get together after the death of a childhood friend to go on a camping trip planned by said friend, seeking a buried treasure they had always talked about as kids.

Seth Green plays his typical annoying high-strung, socially inept character. Matthew Lillard is a successful businessman trying to decide whether or not he wants to do the whole marriage and family thing with his fed-up girlfriend. Dax Shepherd is a teenage rebel turned adult criminal trying to find his big break.

I would recommend this movie as a rental - it's a fun movie to sit around watching with a few friends. I definitely wouldn't recommend the purchase of the movie without seeing it first, though.",1105747200,,881,4.751633986928105
2182957,3,B0006FO95G,"There is an obvious comparison to be made between ""Without a Paddle"" and ""Deliverance,"" and not just because Burt Reynolds is the best thing in both movies.  Both films are about a group of friends who make a big mistake when they decide to take to a river in canoes and both involve the friends being chased by scary guys with big guns.  However, I think there is a stronger point of comparison to be made between this 2004 comedy and the film ""City Slickers,"" because ""Without a Paddle"" is about friends coming to terms with growing up and living in the real world.  Granted, the trio in this comedy do so when they are about to hit thirty instead of waiting for a mid-life crisis, but where as the ""Deliverance"" gang just wanted to get off of the river and out of the woods alive, the trio in this film have important lessons to learn.

Part of the problem with Steven Brill's film is that the serious elements have trouble neatly meshing with the comedic ones.  You can really tell this when you look at the deleted scenes and see the alternate for the one in which Jerry Conlaine (Matthew Lillard) gets the phone call that his childhood friend Billy has died.  Both of them are serious, but one merely touches on it, simply suggesting the seriousness, while the other (the alternative version) turns it into a fairly serious scene.  For most of the film we keep piling on the comic moments to the point that when it becomes time for the friends to learn the BIG LESSON of their adventure in the woods it seems tacked on rather than being the culmination of wall that has gone on before it.

When Jerry returns home for Billy's funeral he meets up with the rest of his childhood friends, Dan Mott (Seth Green), who has become a doctor, and Tom Marshall (Dax Shepard), the group's obvious loser.  Each of the trio has their own problems: Jerry's girl friend is ready to leave him because of his problems with commitment, Dan pretty much picks up a new phobia each day, and the only time Tom is not lying is when he is merely exaggerating big time.  After the funeral they return to their old tree house where they discover their treasure box from when they were kids together.

It turns out the boys were big fans of D.B. Cooper, the guy who hijacked an airline and jumped out of it somewhere in the Pacific Northwest with a whole bunch of money never to be seen again.  Along with some of the treasures of their childhood the trio discover that Billy had recently put a map into the box.  It seems he had a theory about where Cooper landed and this was the trip he had tried to talk his friends into taking the year before.  Now the trio decided to honor the memory of their friend by going treasure hunting.  Of course, once they get into the woods bad things start happening.

Mother Nature has her say in terms of white water rapids and massive rain showers, but on the really bad side of the ledger the boys have repeated encounters with the unfriendly local sheriff (Ray Baker), a giant brown bear (Bart the Bear), and a pair of pot farmers named Dennis (Abraham Benrubi) and Elwood (Ethan Suplee).  On the good side of the ledger there are a couple of blondes (Rachel Blanchard and Christina Moore) up a tree and the pivotal character played by Burt Reynolds (you might as well be surprised at who he turns out to be, especially since he is not who you think he is going to be given the above).

""Without A Paddle"" is based on a story by Fred Wolf and Harris Goldberg & Tom Nursall, with the screenplay being credited to Jay Leggett and Mitch Rouse.  There are some funny bits here, but most of them are really just attempts to be funny that try way too hard and fall short of the mark.  Green, who is usually a marvel of restraint in his performances, as amply demonstrated on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" has to move too far in the other direction, especially during his encounters with the bear.  Meanwhile, Lillard goes in the other direction, because he is technically the leading man in this film and so he has reigned in his character considerably from what we have seen in the ""Scooby Doo"" movies, and it is Shepard who ends up hitting exactly the right note with his character.  I bet a lot of viewers will be reminded of the guy in the Holiday Express commercials who acts like he knows what he is talking about when he does not, but Shepard pulls it off time and time again.

In the final analysis ""Without a Paddle"" is just another disappointing 2004 comedy.  I would not go so far as to say that if you have seen the trailer you have seen all of the funny moments in the film, but it is certainly heading in that direction.  The performance by Shepard stands out, the interplay between the two drug farmers certainly has its moments, and if you can just pretend when Reynolds shows up that the movie has always been heading towards an ending with serious overtones you can get some enjoyment from what happens to the three guys in the end.

Then again, there is an entire tradition of movie comedies that are improved based on what you drink while watching them.  At least that is what I have heard, lacking any personal frame of reference from which to confirm or invalidate the hypothesis.",1105660800,3,5213,4.437106918238993
2182958,2,B0006FO95G,"In high school the guidance counselor asks every student, ""What do you see yourself doing in 10 years?"" Without a paddle offers such an answer in a broader sense as the film depicts the importance of risk taking in both leisure and professional life. The philosophical portion of the film is rudimentary, as it does not dwell on the mysteries of our existence, but merely states that one must take a chance in order to fully live life.

The story begins with a flashback into the main characters' childhood through something that wants to appear like family video footage. Through archives of four neighborhood kids the audience gets to experience the how recklessly they build tree houses, jumped over streams with BMX bikes, and pretended to be Indiana Jones on dangerous quests. This risk taking seemed to have stayed within the four boys as they graduated high school. Billy, the most prone to take risks, is the first to leave the small town after high school graduation. The three friends later follow Billy's example as they end up in different parts of society.

Years later the three boys have become adults and they all face the age of 30 with some level of anxiety. The once careless youth that faced the world with nonchalant bravery are now forced to deal with the responsibilities of adulthood, as they are doctors, businessmen, and drifting loners. On the day of Jerry Conlaine's (Matthew Lillard) dating anniversary his mom calls with sad news as Billy has passed on. Jerry calls Dan Mott (Seth Green) and Tom Marshall (Dax Shepard) about the sad news and they all participate in their lost friend's funeral.

In reflection of the past, the three friends enter the backyard where their tree house still exists, and they discover a secret treasure map. The map is connected with an incident regarding an old robbery and it appears that Billy had planned a trip for his friends to uncover the treasure. This opportunity makes the three friends once more feel young as they enter the quest for the treasure in the name of Billy. Before they know it they are in too deep for their own good as they enter the dark woods of Oregon through a slow moving river much like that in Deliverance (1972), but it is far from a similar cinematic experience.

Without a Paddle is directed by Steven Brill who also made Mr. Deeds (2002) and Little Nicky (2000), and this time Brill makes an entertaining mix with seriousness and humor. However, comedy is about timing and Without a Paddle seems to be off in its timing. The film has its moments, but some moments are awkward such as when Jerry attempts to untie his gym shoes to outrun a bear. In the version that is more commonly told among friends, the person wears heavy boots and as the boots are too heavy for escaping a bear the person unties them and takes them off. This untying of the shoes is an example of the lack of originality and misses as the timing seemed to be wrong. The film also leans heavily on ""borrowing"" from other films. For example, there is a sequence borrowed from Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983).

There have been other films that have borrowed much from other films such as the hilarious Spaceballs (1987) by Mel Brooks; however, Brooks' film is timely, goofy, and off the wall. Without a Paddle tries to be funny in this way, but never achieves this level of comedy because the timing is off. This generates an awkwardness that appears to stem from Brill's attempts to incorporate serious undertones through existential philosophy, and it completely purges the comedy. Thus, Without a Paddle leaves a similar imprint as guidance counselors leave on many teenagers by asking existential questions in regards to planning. It is relevant, but out of context as most teenagers do not focus on long term planning. Despite the negative aspect of the film there are several moments when the audience will burst out in bellyaching laughter.",1105574400,6,3930,4.739766081871345

2183003,3,B0006FO95G,The movie was dumb/funny. I liked the male bonding jokes and the cannibis growing hillbillies.,1094515200,,94,5.333333333333333
2183004,5,B0006FO95G,"Seth Green and Matthew Lillard are great comedians. Seth Green was always fantastic when he was Scott Evil and so is Matthew Lillard when he plays Shaggy in Scooby-Doo because he manages to capture the exact essence of that character. It's hard to believe that the same person who played Shaggy was also the same psycho killer in SCREAM. I never have heard of Dax Shepard, but I was told he from that show PUNK'D which I saw once but it was pretty funny, so basically a comedy with all 3 of these guys looks promising to be funny.

I knew I had to see this movie when I saw the trailer to this film and was watching all 3 of them huddle together and Dax Shepard going ""This never leaves the cave!"" Summer 2004 came out with many good films, movies like Shrek 2, Spiderman, Dodgeball, I' Robot, Collateral, and this. This sure did make me laugh and now I cannot wait till it comes out on DVD. I was really surprised that many critics had given this movie a lot of bad reviews. I do not know why, there were many parts in the movie that will make anybody laugh and I am not just talking about the part where all 3 of the main characters were huddled together. There was a scene where they were running through a marijuana field and all 3 of them started getting high. That was part was hilarious. Anyway here is the plot.

Dan, Tom, Jerry and Billy are 4 guys who have been friends since they were little kids.  They were always obsessed with a story about a pilot named DB Cooper whose plane crashed and he had $200,000 on him yet only $5,800 was found.  It was always their dream to one day go on an adventure and find that treasure.  However years later, their good friend Billy dies.  At the funeral, Dan (Seth Green), Jerry (Matthew Lillard), and Tom (Dax Shepard) reunite and reminiscence about old times.  Later they all take a visit to their old tree house and discover something interesting.  It turns out that before Billy died, he had done some of his research on Db Cooper and may have found where he actually is and made a map of it.  The 3 of them decide to go on an adventure and find DB cooper's treasure.  However there dream adventure turns into a crazy and zany nightmare.  They find themselves having a run in with a bear and 2 drug dealers (Ethan Suplee and Abraham Benrubi).  They then find themselves running for their lives from the drug dealers who want them dead and they also meet a couple of very attractive tree ladies who have very hairy legs.  Anything that could possibly go wrong goes wrong.

In conclusion, Without a Paddle was a very funny comedy.  It was sweet, some of the  jokes were gross (like the hairy leg chicks), but above all it was hilarious.  I want to see it again.  See this movie.",1094515200,4,2728,4.336614173228346
2183005,4,B0006FO95G,"I love comedy movies that take place in the outdoors.  The Great Outdoors is one of my all-time favorite comedy movies.  So from viewing the previews of this movie, I was immediately intrigued to see this movie and I was not disappointed.

The movie is about a group of childhood friends who are over-run by a fascination for a bank robber's lost treasure.  The four of them make a pact o find this treasure one day.  Well, when one of their friends die in an car accident, the other three, Tom (Dax Sheppard), Jim (Matthew Lillard) and Dan (Seth Green) realize that they are 30 now and that their time is running out to do something great as a group of friends.  They discover that Billy, the friend that died, left them a map, where he believes the treasure is located.  The guys go out to the wilderness and attempt to find this treasure, which results in many comedic situations.

The story line of this movie was pretty good.  It was believable plot, although it got a little far-fetched at some points.  The aspect that made this movie good was the cast's chemistry with eachother.  They seemed to bond really well, and from watching the movie you could believe that these guys would be friends in real life.  Tom and Jim were the laid-back, adventerous personalities and Dan was the ""fear of everything"" and very hesitant member of the group.  They all played their roles very well.  Just about everything that came out of Dax Sheppard was very funny.  Seth Green and Matthew Lillard both have so much comedy potential.

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie.  As stated earlier, the setting of the movie was really good and created the potential for comedy.  If you are looking for a fun movie that contains some adult humor and slapstick humor, then I would definately recommend seeing this movie.",1094169600,,1805,4.640378548895899
2183006,3,B0006FO95G,"When a childhood friend dies, Jerry (Lillard), Dan (Green), and Tom (Shepard) are reunited at the funeral.  While reminiscing about old times, they remember a treasure hunt that they were all going to go on.  Discovering maps and plans in their now-dead friend's treehouse, they decide to embark upon a quest for the treasure in the deep woods.  These city boys are way out of place and soon find themselves facing a bear, and two rednecks that are up to no good.

After seeing this, it seems that they movie is trying to capture the sweetness/grossness of the ""American Pie"" movies.  The problem is that with a PG-13 rating, the grossness does not reach the hilarity that was in ""American Pie"", and the sweetness comes off as cheesy.  These ""serious"" scenes just do not work.  My recommendation is to wait for DVD.  You will get some good laughs out of this movie, bu not enough.",1093824000,,880,4.632258064516129
2183007,4,B0006FO95G,"Hysterical! This movie was funny the whole way through! It starts out with four best friends since childhood, Dan, Jerry, Tom, and Billy. Billy ends up dying early on in the movie, leaving the three now adult friends remembering him. They go through some things they use to do when there were younger. They come upon a box, which in it contains information about a guy who stole some money and a map that marks where the treasure is. So Dan (Seth Green), Jerry (Matthew Lillard), and Tom (Dax Shepard) decide to go on the trip to find the treasure, the trip that they never got to do with Billy. Well, it is harder than it seems. They will have to go through many obstacles if they want to find the treasure. They will have to travel by boat and by land. Things seem to go on their trip that makes it go upside down! I actually thought this was going to be one of those just o.k. movies. I was wrong. It started out funny and I laughed the whole way through. Teenagers will love to this movie! This movie teaches some lessons about friendship and having to work together. A great movie for teens and above to see!!",1093651200,11,1114,4.309523809523809
2183008,2,B0006FO95G,This was an okay movie. It has some fun parts like for instance When they were huddled together with R Kelly playing in the background. Saying this never leaves the cave.

No Oscars were offered, and none were broken during the making of this film.
Probably SHOULD've been sold as a two-fer the price of one deal.
The sequel is, strictly, rainy day entertainment.",1512345600,,266,4.680851063829787
