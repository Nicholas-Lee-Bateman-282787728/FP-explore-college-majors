The attention to detail blows my mind and I can only hope my designs come out half as good as his. After watching this dvds (and the others released by TGW) I can honestly say my techniques has improved vastly. I am great at drawing people but robots, vehicles, and anything mechanical always gave me trouble until I watched these tutorials from Feng.",1242172800,,457,4.654320987654321
8131096,4,B000GETUWE,"This instructional DVD is very inspiring, but since it was recorded with out using camtasia you will not be able to see what button he clicked. This DVD was originally designed to give experienced Designer's an insight as to how to approach Robot design. Most Gnomon DVD's are geared towards a professional audience therefore nearly useless to beginners.",1185062400,2,354,5.120689655172414
8131097,1,B000GETUWE,"I've seen about a dozen of these Gnomon DVDs now, some I checked out of my school and work libraries, and one I bought (The Techniques or Ryan Church). The artists are obviously amazing at their craft, but these DVDs provide very little insight as to any real technique. Each DVD I've seen so far has mundane dialogue giving a general description on how to approach the subject. Very little empahisis is put onto anything specific, and each artist goes by BLINDINGLY fast. The viewer is very hard pressed to keep up, and almost no detail is given on what exactly the artist is doing. It doesn't matter if it's 3D or 2D, you're still going to get lost. To make matters worse, these DVDs are ALL incredibly blurry!! You simply cannot put them into focus, which adds to the overall frustration. You're better off just going on Feng Zhu's website for tutorials, or checking out any of the myriad of websites out there for better instruction. Shame on you Gnomon. Great lineup of artists, bad DVD quality.",1163980800,8,1000,4.623595505617978
