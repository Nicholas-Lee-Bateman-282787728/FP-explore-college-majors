2246316,5,B0007WFUMY,"Accurate ,terse, clear portrayal . Hemingway is shown, all of his worts. Not fawning, not too long,shows Papa at his best and worst. The parts on Spain and the Nobel[meaning the Old Man and the Sea,which rehabilitated his reputation}  are especially well done. Hemingway has fallen out of favor,again. People mistake courage for bluster,show for substance. He was a complex man who wrote the most influential prose of the american century. I obscenity those who criticize him and this show.",1304812800,2,490,5.125
2246317,5,B0007WFUMY,"Produced in 1998 for A&E's ""Biography"" series, ""Ernest Hemingway: Wrestling With Life"" is simply the best documentary ever produced on the Nobel and Pulitzer Prize-winning author.  This 90-minute documentary is narrated by Hemingway's grand daughter, actress Mariel Hemingway, and features insightful comments from Ernest's sons Jack and Gregory.  ""Papa Hemingway"" author A.E. Hotchner and publisher Charles Scribner III also provide illuminating commentary. The documentary takes us from Hemingway's childhood in Oak Park, Illinois to his final, tragic days in Ketchum, Idaho, detailing the triumphs and tragedies of the legendary author's life.  ""Papa"" is not always presented in a flattering light, as Hemingway's infidelities, personality flaws, and struggles with alcohol and depression are all discussed unflinchingly.  Actor Scott Glenn reads from Hemingway's works and letters, and most surprising for a documentary of this nature is composer Frank Becker's memorable and evocative music score for this fine production.

""Ernest Hemingway: Wrestling With Life"" is a triumph and a must-see for those who love this author's work;  his life was just as fascinating.",1245801600,8,1170,5.852941176470588
2246318,4,B0007WFUMY,"As a new teacher looking for material to accompany my lessons, I bought this to show to my 11th grade American Lit students. I ended up returning it only because after renting it from the library, I decided I preferred to own the more recent documentary on Hemingway's life, ""Rivers to the Stream.""

""Wrestling with Life"" is narrated by a very stiff and serious Mariel who looks like she's about 18. It also goes a bit too extensively into his childhood and his antipathy towards his mother. But keep in mind I bought this to view with my 11th graders so I was also watching it through their highly crticial and easily distractable eyes. Had it been the only one available, it would have done the job. But the newer DVD is much richer in my opinion. (I found the negative reviews of ""Rivers to the Stream"" completely unfounded;I had no problem with female narration of his short stories.)",1178928000,11,888,4.584905660377358
2246319,4,B0007WFUMY,"A worthwhile and well constructed precise of Hemingway's life, most valuable for its  insights from Hemingway's sons and archival moving film footage, including some sound bites of Hemingway speaking. The video relies (necessarily) on a fair amount of still photography, much of which will be familar to Hemingway aficionados, nevertheless, the presentation is compelling.",1122854400,24,372,5.888888888888889

8052665,5,B0007WFUMY,"We all know Hemingway as a great writer, but sometimes his greatness seems to overshadow and overpower his human side. For many readers, Hemingway becomes just words on a page. Great words but words nevertheless.

This video does something very different: it shows Hemingway not just as a writer, but as a real person, a human being, with struggles, demons, an adventurous spirit as well as vices and internal turmoil that eventually led to his demise.

A wonderful video! Very much worth your time. My literature students loved it, too. You don't have to be perfect to be great. Highly recommended.",1377388800,2,599,4.920792079207921
8052666,5,B0007WFUMY,"Learned a great deal from this Video. Ernest writes like a man's man, tried to live like one, living with no regrets. This video looks at that life, but also how he cheated on his many wives and his distance relationships with his children. Get this if you want to explore the life of Hemingway...good, bad, warts and all.",1353196800,3,322,4.47457627118644
