5055909,4,B007549XLG,"The problem with a lot of great shows that try to be more than SpongeBob or Flapjack, is that it has no audience. They end up stuck in this void between its targeted audience, and people that don't know how to grow up and move on.

Granted, everyone is entitled to their opinion. But when it becomes clouded by what you loved as a child and not letting something move on in a creative way while still maintaining its core ideology, that's when opinions become questionable at best.

X-Men ran off in the opposite direction of Iron Man and Wolverine, and what I mean by that is that it doesn't suck. The plot is put together well enough that it's easy to follow, but it still has some twist and unexpected turns. It may have been a little out there for people who rarely watch anime, but it still doesn't reach anywhere near far-fetched.

Each of the X-Men represent themselves well here. Cyclops is cocky towards Logan, even though he shouldn't be, and a bit of an emotional wreck. Logan is still the angry little hairy man he always is. Storm is the level headed voice of reason. Beast is the scientific genius we all know and love. Emma is the sensual den mother with very capable psychic abilities. Xavier retains his role as father, mentor, and guide for his students. Hisako is a teenager who is coming into her powers. They all come together nicely, even during the few times the characters clash over certain things.

I hate to dedicate a section of my review to this, but since it seems to be an issue, yes Storm, Emma, and Jean are shapely women. But when have they not been!? Look at the females in the comics and 90's television series. Unless they are teenagers, they are shapely. Actually, Storm has more fabric on in this, than she has had in a while! Why this sort of thing is even an issue, is a little outlandish. The best I can come up with and not offend anyone, is that some people are either too blinded by rage to remember that women tend to be shapely in ALL comics, or that they just lived a sheltered life. I honestly don't know their thought process.

Action wise, the show does a good job. There is just enough action to break up the drama of the show, and when there is action on screen it impresses. The show is wonderfully animated, Madhouse really did some of their best work here. While it is a bit more graphic than shows created for children, it's no more graphic that what you would see in the PG-13 DC releases. If you're familiar with Super-Man: Doomsday, Batman: Gotham Knight, etc, it's on par with those, but with a lot more style. Even when Logan has his Berserker Rage triggered the show doesn't exceed PG-13 status. Though it is the epitome of epicness!

I've gone on long enough, and my apologies for making the review so long. This all wrapped in a nutshell is me saying, have an open mind people. Stop comparing every show that comes out directly with its source material. Source material is merely a road map for new ideas. As long as it is done in a creative way that doesn't throw away everything that made the source material great, diamonds can be formed from coal. This take on The X-Men may not be the best one available, but it is a good show and deserves to be recognized for that. Not bashed because it's not word for word, action for action, what you grew up with.",1334880000,11,3321,4.4094616639477975
5055910,5,B007549XLG,"To start off, I been watching amine types shows/movies for over 30 years. I am not expert, nor am I a writer.

I really enjoy watching the show and the art work that went into the making of the show. If there other seasons to add on to this I be looking forward (But in itself its really impressed me). Its a heck of a lot better then the old cartoon style from the xmen 90's. Art work is really in detail. They did the charters personality well from the comic books, and from their own point of views. Wolverine getting trash here and there was great to watch. As for blood and guts, I give this a Not even a PG-13. People that put this show together shows a lot of promises. Story line flows really well to its own toon.

People have there own ideas and complates about this show. I thought it was a good balance.

Why title getting better: 1.  Beats the 90's Xmen cartoon, not the comic. 2. Depends where show/movie made, they can only go so far because of control rules.",1333411200,8,974,4.192513368983957
5055911,1,B007549XLG,"I was thrilled when I heard an X-Men Anime was coming to America.  I was even more thrilled when I heard it was coming to television, to the channel 'G4'.  I was not able to watch this series on Friday nights, but managed to view the encore on Sunday mornings.

WHAT A LET DOWN!!!

As another Amazon reviewer said, it's like porn without the porn.  I was not coming to watch porn.  I wanted to see X-Men, in action, spliced with the feel and look of Anime inkers.  Let me be clear, this is actually NOT porn.  But the female characters, exps: Storm and Emma Frost, look so rediculous with their G-cup sized breasts your not sure what your watching.  Your are teased every episode.  I don't think I saw one female with proportionly sized boobs.  Felt like I was watching Queen's Blade sometimes.

Action wise this sucked.  This a talking Anime, and I hate animes where everyone justs stands around and chats.

One factor though above all I thought would be stellar, that was Wolverine.  Anime is extremely bloody and violent at times.  I really thought the writers and animators would put his Healing Factor threw the ringer with epic scences of him getting mangled and recovering.  I NEVER saw it.

Truth time:  I hated this series so much I gave up on it.  Could not make it threw the entire series.  From what I've been reading, sounds like I didn't miss anything.

Don't waste your money.  This is NOT epic.  Spend your money on the original 1990's X-Men series now out on DVD.  MUCH better purchase, kind of dated in it's presentation; but still an infinitly better purchase than this ""Anime"".

You have been warned.",1333324800,19,1620,4.557491289198606
5055912,3,B007549XLG,"I am an X-Men fan.

I've been once ever since the Animated Series premiered during the 90's.

Since then, I've collected comics, movies, games and any other items related to the Marvel Heroes.
When I learned an Anime was being made based off the comic, I wasn't sure of what to expect.
I felt, if it was done correctly, it could end up being just as good as the old 90's series was.

After watching all the episodes, I can say that while I was rather disappointed, I don't think it
was bad at all.  The voice acting ranging from Steven Jay Blum to Jennifer Hale is well done,
and the designs look fairly interesting and awesome. This is clearly the best sounding and
best looking X-Men series yet.

The only downside, and the biggest one, is the story.

Without spoiling much, the X-Men are summoned to Japan to investigate the mysterious kidnappings
of mutants there. The story, like a lot of Anime, is slower paced, and takes awhile to really start getting to the point.  Lines are repeated like a broken record, and characters beat you over the head with ideas and thoughts you just heard previously, just in case you weren't paying attention. The main villain was a big surprise, but he's not as mainstream as say, Magneto, so the average viewer may not even grab interest from him. And the newly introduced X-Man, Hisako (Armor), ranges from tolerable to unbearably loud and annoying.  I get that she's supposed to be the rookie member with a cocky attitude (Similar to how she is in the comics) but even Jubilee knew when the time came to get
serious and stop screwing around. Geez.

So, despite the good looking and acting show, your still left with a short, somewhat shallow story that feels as
if it could have been done in 30 or 60 minutes rather than stretched into a full 12 episode Anime.

And yet? Maybe its the fan in me, but I loved ever second of this Anime. The X-Men are, after so long, portrayed
like X-Men. The stakes are high, and the sheer atmosphere pulls you in. Again, it doesn't reach the heights of the
90's series, but I think its unfair to call this series a failure.  If your an X-Men fan, or even if your somewhat curious,
check it out yourself. You may not be disappointed. :)

5056016,2,B007549XLG,"There's a difference between building a story and just being needlessly expository.  I was excited to see this when I saw Warren Ellis wrote the story.  Either he dialed it in or the production company butchered it.

The fights range between chaotic and impossible to follow and are so badly choreographed that it beggars the mind.  People stand around having discussions when they should be kicking ass.  They continue talking when they should be giving chase.  The female characters are weepy and doe-eyed and laughably well-endowed, every one (an anime tradition, I know, on all counts).  The X-Men have long had a tradition of strong female characters and they don't really feel like X-Women in this series.

And why the crap do they keep turning their powers off (Hisako and Emma, I'm looking at you) at random moments during a fight?

Storm is again more underutilized than any other superhero ever in a story where she appears.  She gets her butt kicked way too often and makes awful use of her powers.  Hisako is dumbed down.  A lot.  It's disappointing as a fan.  More Jean.  Yay.  Er...can we let that plot go now?  Finally...Wolverine.  Why?  Always Wolverine.  I'm getting as tired of him as I am of Batman being the go-to focal point of DC, the gravity around which all other elements orbit and are judged in relation to and who can take all challengers.  The X-Men are far more than Wolverine, Professor X, Jean and Scott.

The voice acting runs the range from pretty good to Xavier's godawful performance.  It made me want to stuff lizards in my ears and eat cactus needles.

I'm not sure what Marvel's problem is.  I had hoped this would address some of the shortcomings of their animated features which are an order of magnitude less well-done than their DC counterparts, but so far, no joy.  This is plodding and slow, forcibly talky and the action sequences are disappointing rather than the epic goodness of say, even Justice League Unlimited.

This series features a story about mutant experimentation gone awry and the X-men must solve the case. In the background there is a classic story arc with Cyke and Jean, Professor X is mentally trying to save an important character (to him) revealing his past.

The series started out promising - the idea of The U-Men harvesting mutant organs felt like the creators were taking on a decidedly adult tone, but unfortunately my interest started to wane very quickly. I too agree that this project would have served better as a feature length rather than trying to stretch it to a 12-episode run. For the most part the voice acting worked well (English adaptation) however as usual my favourite X-Man, Storm, was a bastardised version of herself. Gone was the regal African goddess in favour of a two-dimensional stereotypically ""white"" female. Exposition was rampant throughout as characters repeatedly explained their motivations over and over again that it really stifled the story and action. The action was true to the anime style.

They were ok but something was lacking and I'm just not sure what. They were beautiful to look at but I think something int he story got lost in the translation. It just wasn't as good as I had hoped for. The X Men anime was probably the most disappointing of them all. X men is my favorite comic so I had really high hopes. Instead of telling a familiar tale they pulled something unfamiliar out of their butts called the U men.

5056102,5,B007549XLG,"The Japanese animation brings the character of the X-men alive, the story will question the viewers - and lives behind puzzles of what had happen in Japan, the story will slowly reveal in time in the second DVD. If you are an anime fans, you will need to watch every series and moment to fully understand the story behind and it will reveal the 'why and how' in time. Based on the review - "" the action hinges largely around the capture of Hisako Ichiki ( a young Jap girl ) just how is she related? There is new enemies called the ""U-Men"" as part of their plan to create a mutant super-army. Further on, the story goes deeper, with Emma Frost.

Spolier: Take note - in the first movie clip; Jean Grey has perished, and Cyclops last seen Emma Frost in the battle. How does Emma Frost come into the picture? Follow by the Inner Circle's Club and the rise of a mysterious condition affecting mutants across Japan. the X-Men encounter the fanatical anti-mutant group, the U-Men, and discover what was important enough for Xavier to bring them back together. The answer is something that could potentially bridge the gap between mutants and humans, or tear the two species apart forever.

Take note - the  Xmen Series will stretched into a full 12 episode Anime, and after watching the last episode, the second season of X-Men would introduce our favourite old arch enemy 'magnetism' but it remains unreleased at this time. Stay tune.

My summary The action and the characters animation & voice over are very well rendered. I will watch the Wolverine & IronMan in time as well. To all X-men fan, try to watch a glimpse of the clip, it is different from the 90's animated X-men.",1372204800,3,1673,4.566666666666666

In my opinion I think it makes the action sequences all the more great since they are not a constant and brings some realism to a fantasy world. I mean why would they be constantly fighting? They should be solving a mystery having internal conflicts and fighting when attacked by the very people they are trying to foil.

There's even a new character that follows the traditions of Japanese Anime.  Like it's American version of the 90's animated X-Men, you can watch this more than once and get something from each viewing.  This set has  adult themes and would be more appropriate for older fans.  It's more PG than G rated for intensity.

5056170,4,B007549XLG,"So Marvel and Madhouse's team up effort on X-men.

I can say I liked it. But it is definitely far from perfect. The good points however outweigh the bad, even so I will probably dwell more on the ""bad"" parts (Subject to opinion.)

Good: The art. This is good anime design. Where characters are not all effectively carbon copies of each other with a different hairstyle or costume. It falls into the more realistic style, which is something Madhouse tends to lean towards.

Overall plot was one of the better ones, even discounting certain areas where it falls flat. The dialogue heavy scenes were actually the more engaging for me.

They avoided recycling the same story every X-Men show seems to go through. (Though it is touched on at the beginning this is more or less the aftermath of it.)

Voice acting ranges from competent to well Steve Bloom. He's pretty much well mastered that job and none can really complain about his work and be taken seriously.

Wolverine done right.

Now the bad: *Spoilers ahead you be warned.)

Anime ending. Yes sadly we can't escape from the overdone power of friendship and hope ending that plagues anime.

Prof X's logic at the end. I suppose they were trying to show him being a mature responsible man accepting his role in what happened, except... he's totally wrong.  Without going into too much detail he's trying to accept part of the blame for something he was totally deceived about and just learned any details of during the series. I am all for a man owning up to his mistakes, but when the woman involved flat out lies to you, uses tech and other means to hide the child you and she had together from your eyes(and in this case his thoughts.) I don't see him as having any responsibility aside from forgetting to wear a condom 15 years ago.

Any attempt to make the Prof ex lover remotely sympathetic. Sorry Dr Mengel and she are on the same level for crimes against humanity. Her poor me I just want to protect my boy tripe doesn't fly. (at least in the show the X-Men call her out on it over and over.)

Anime mutants. The super mutant freak things that show up look like they belong in Resident Evil, not the X-Men. Seems another overused staple of anime had to be thrown in, where something is forced to change form and comes out as a mass of veins and misplaced tissue, with teeth in spots they just don't belong.

Cyclops. I know he's far from the top favored member of the X-Men, but here they pretty much well reduce him to an emo wreck who can't get his act together. There are a few moments where he pulls his head out of his hind end and does the right thing, but they are pretty much well canceled out by his normal attitude.

Action Scenes.. Yes I went there. I know some reviewers praised the action as excellent that said the plot was weak, but they have it backwards. The plot was well done with some flawed areas, and the action was mediocre with a few stand out good areas.
Most of the action scenes consist of some bad guy showing up. Talking... more talking.. random X-man attacks.. bad guy deflects,(Which the scene is 7 out of ten times a still shot with voice work in it) more talking rinse and repeat until they manage to get the winning shot in. It's your standard anime fight where they talk more smack and take a few passes at each other, instead of actively trying to take their opponent out. On occasion they seem to pull out the budget and actually animate a scene, but the majority of the fights are as described before.

Highly recommended for X-Men/Anime fans.

Just recommended for X-Men fans.

Barely recommended for X-Men fans who are not too fond of anime.

5056202,5,B007549XLG,"If you like anime (like I do) and you love the X-men (that's me too), then you'll really love X-men anime. You also might find yourself wondering, why X-men in anime-style hasn't been done before. Especially, since the emotionalistic themes and fast-paced, dynamic action scenes so common to anime, lend themselves so well to the types of stories and characters we find in the X-men, resulting in a perfect marriage, and the best X-men animated series yet! Now, how do I justify that claim? Well, for starters, this is the best I've ever seen the X-men in animation form, and yes, I have seen all the other animated series (including the original 80s pilot). Second, I thought the characterizations were spot-on, and the plot unfolds like a good detective story, climaxing in one of the most emotional endings to an X-men story since the death of Jean Grey.

Now, I know most of the other reviewers here on amazon give kudos to the animation in the series, but find it flawed in the story-telling. I notice two major objections to the series; one is to the choice of villians (the Inner Circle, U-men), instead of Magneto and the Mutant Brotherhood, and two, is the plot. I find the villain objection problematic give the choice of time and location for the series, this is post-Pheonix saga, Magneto is incarcerated, and the Brotherhood disbanded. Of course, they didn't have to choose that time and location for the series, but its a sensible one. How many times do we have to relive the Sentinels storyline? Everytime a new series gets started? That gets old. Also, the choice of villians works well with the addition of Emma Frost to the X team. Second, the plot is done as a single story-arc that takes place over the entire length of the series, tweleve episodes. This is unusual for an X-men animated series, but it hooked me in for the entire tweleve episodes, so it worked. Most X-men animated series do single episode stories, with a few multi-episode story-arcs, and maybe a weak seasonal arc. There are problems with that approach too, like losing your audience along the way, or over-streaching your seasonal arc. If you missed X-men anime on G4, and are not using Google play, or would like to see this series on a TV screen, instead of a computer console, check out this Dvd! In one word, awesome!",1341273600,,2312,4.708641975308642
5056203,5,B007549XLG,"Just watched the first 5 episodes of the series -- of which I hope they release the second season...SOON! -- and found it an excellent take on the team. No, it didn't use big name villians like Magneto, yet the bad guys are still as nasty. I think the choices made were all good, as it's a slower pace than what was done in the 90's, which was good for the time, but I found it introduced too many characters quickly and the plots developed too fast. This version allows a chance to get to know and to care about the characters. It's paced to allow the development of a deep story, instead of a lot of flash like that of the 90's version. I also HATED Jubilee (water-downed Dazzler wannabe meant to appeal to kids?...FAIL!). The child in this version is well-done, though I still have a problem with seeking to sell it to the younger sect because Anime, to me, is a more adult medium due to the topics/stories covered in the genre, particularly sex and death. American mainstream audiences, in my opinion, aren't really hip to good, thought-provoking animation on par with live-action film. The idea of a ""cartoon"" having people die, swear, or engage in sex is a total no-no. I consider this orders of magnitude better than any other video featuring The X-men.

5056205,4,B007549XLG,"The animation and action sequences are really well done. The voice acting is for the most part appropriate. The overall vibe of this series's is a mixture of Japanese animation, Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men comics and the X-Men movie, particularly after the third one as the story pretty much picks up after the Dark Phoenix's death. A positive is that Cyclops is front and center of the story unlike the movie.
The weak link of this series is essentially the plot and the odd choices of characters used especially for the main antagonist (I'm going to try to be vague to not give away the entire story.) This results in downplaying the power levels of some characters and unnecessary plot holes in the entire story. The pace of this series is kind of dragged on sometimes but is a characteristic of Japanese anime storytelling.
Overall it is definitely fun and I look forward to the second season if it is ever picked up again to watch great animation & action sequences and new interpretations of other known characters. I definitely recommend it!",1339977600,,1052,4.785714285714286
5056206,2,B007549XLG,"This X-Men show takes place right after the X-Men loss Jean Gray. Magneto is locked up and is in prison somewhere, and the other big super villains are no where to been seen or heard of. So, what we get to see are lesser known enemies, the U-Men and the inner circle.

All the better known X-Men are here and this series introduces a new junior X-Men member that I never heard of, but comic fans know her, Hisako Ichiki (Armor). We get to see how and why she joins the X-Men for this show. Also, Emma Forst joins the X-Men as well.

This show started out great. Nice animation, storyline, and characters. Then, the Japanese story telling came in. There are a bunch of filer story that you do not need to know to progress the story, they are just there to drag the story along. Then, what worse is they tend to repeat the same old story that we heard way too much about. This whole series could be cut 1/3, if they just didn't throw in all that slow dragged out story telling.

I like how they draw all the characters and background, but what I didn't like was them having them standing around and doing nothing. The action in this series is ridiculously less than anything I have seen before. In a 20 minute show, you be lucky to see 2 mins of action!!! Heck, in the last few shows, they barely did anything. They stood around telling themselves to wait and stand around watching the enemy's movements. There was 15 seconds of actions before that but was that even worth a buck to see??? I say no.

The Japanese tend to draw really big boobs on females and this show is no different!!! If you like seeing that stuff. Buy, Buy, and Buy Now!!! All the females have really HUGE ONES HERE! The littlest is a D cup that's really saying something. So, when you see the other females, OMG!!!

And for you all you gay guys/females out there, yeah, they draw nice packages on the guys as well. It's not ridiculous sized like the females, but yeah, you can say they got something down there. lol

I like how they try to show more of the variety of characters in the marvel universe at the end, but they didn't do anything with them. All you see is them standing around or a frame shot of them helping other people. It's typical Japanese style animation.

I really wish they would stop holding back all the action and actually draw interesting fight scenes that last longer than a minute or two. It gets really boring just seeing a few people just stand around to the next few people just stand around, to a minute fight, to people just walking slowly around, and so on. Man, that's boring!!!

5056208,5,B007549XLG,"its great series action pg13 rated action packed some adult humor thrown in to series scene wolvierine was about to slash down door cyclops found button to open door wolvie called him smart*$%, they show few other mutans & xmen alike in last episode deadpool, rouge. othres but they don't speak few appeances in few scenes thats it i was very glad the showed other mutants in last episode without them this series would have left me little short deadpool my favorite marvel character with wolvie in marvel universe i was surprised they showed him in last episode for what he is & does in marvel universe.

but if you watch after credits you small scene what to expect if there is to be series 2 and i would i for one like there another xmen series of this set to show more mutants of ones i like and do not like in marvel universe to show some iconic fights with some of certain characters as well will be big hit to season 2 if there is one.

i was dissapointed with first few episodes at first cyclops was acting like wolverine and wolverine was acting like cyclops but with what happedn in first episode of series i can understand direction with wolvie & cyclops personalitys in this series but it that has changed eventually more episodes you watch",1339459200,,1252,4.462882096069869
5056209,2,B007549XLG,"I really wanted to like this series, but just couldn't.  The art is excellent.  The voice over is very well done.  The action, when there is action, is fast and brutal without being violent; meaning it reaches a middle ground that will be suitable but satisfying for a wide audience.  What is wrong then?  The problems are in the pacing and story.  The series really should have been about half the time, as there was a lot of material that could have been cut without hurting the story at all.  There are some sections that just seem to drag and other sections, such as Cyclops mourning, that are repeated far too often.  It does not help that the story is predictable and unoriginal.  There may be some new elements, but any fan of the X-Men will have already seen most of this content in some shape or form.  Overall, there are just too many better ways to spend your time and money to recommend this to anyone but the most diehard of fans (and they will be most familiar with this material).",1338768000,13,995,4.417582417582418
5056210,4,B007549XLG,"I am not a big fan of the X-Men to start off. I mildly enjoy Bryan Singer's lumbering first two films and completely write off Brett Ratner's needless ""X-Men: The Last Stand."" My favorite movies featuring the mutants are ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" and ""X-Men: First Class."" Needless to say, I did not have high expectations going into Marvel Anime's ""X-Men: Animated Series.""

At 287 minutes of material for the TV episodes alone, this 2-disc set is well-worth the money ""X-Men"" enthusiasts will pay to own it. The special features are a great bonus and will thrill those wanting insight into the making of this series. Parents need to keep in mind that this is not the Saturday morning cartoon ""X-Men"" found on Disney XD. The anime ""X-Men: Animated Series"" is geared for an older audience. It's too bad they only released this in a regular DVD format. It would have looked and sounded superb in high definition Blu-ray.",1338595200,,920,4.822784810126582
5056211,4,B007549XLG,"First off, for long time fans of the characters, most of them are written very true to established norms for them.  Cyclops is an angsty jerk, Beast is a kindhearted scientist a Wolverine is a ""loner"" who actually cares more for his friends then he lets on (I think the Japanese have a term for that...).  The women suffer a bit, but for very different reasons.  Storm doesn't get much focus, though she has a bit more attitude in the dub to make up for it.  Then again, I'm a fan for Storm being team leader, so I'm never satisfied by her animated outings.  Emma and Armor get focus, but their characterizations aren't quite true to comics.  Much like in Wolverine and the X-men, Emma wasn't a totally evil, sadistic monster of a woman in her early career, though she does have guilt over her past.  Armor is more young Kitty Pryde, just Japanese and with a new powerset, which is probably going to annoy big fans of hers.  Still, having her fill the traditional ""new girl"" role the way Kitty, Rogue and Jubilee (or even Magma for X-men Legends fans) have in past shows and comics works pretty well, so helps the whole show feel like the X-men should.

Being as it was a collaboration between East and West, it feels quite like the comic.  Designs have classic elements and a bit of black leather which might make some think of Morrison's run or the movies.  The English dub is, in my opinion, superior, bringing back Steve Blum for Wolverine and having a well chosen cast for everyone else.  The language and mannerisms in the English are sure to please fans, due to more regular use of a character's real name, and Wolverine using various established nicknames (such as calling Xavier ""Chuck"").  Being ""one of those people"" I did play the first few episodes with the dub and subtitles on at the same time, so I can say that the same information is presented in both languages, though sometimes the order is changed up a bit for a better flow in the English.  The setting is an established X-men universe, where they have had many hard battles before, and apparently other members currently on the team.  Magneto is mentioned several times, despite not being shown, so it helps it all feel as if you just picked up an issue and started reading an established world.

One warning is that the show doesn't really use the major X-men villains, using a few altered versions of classics with (as far as I know) original creations.  It works out well enough, but it will leave you wanting if you are hoping for Sentinel armies, Magneto welcoming to X-men to die, or other iconic foes.  The fights have moments of great action mixed with some moments where you wish people weren't just standing around waiting their turn.  There are no frantic multilayered fights like the 90's X-men cartoon had, so sadly no real scenes where you'll see much action going on in the background while another battle rages in the fore.  When it's moving though, it's solid.  For those curious, yes, Wolverine gets to slash enemies, and badguys are killed, but the violence never really kicks past a PG-13 level.  Sexuality is also never a big focus.  The women are beautiful and sexy, but nothing is ever done in a fanservicy way, unlike, say, an issue drawn by Jim Lee or something.  I actually only mention it due to reading a review that made it seem as if it was a huge focus of the show, which isn't true.

Biggest worry is that there isn't an announcement for a season 2 yet.  The overall pace was a bit slower then other X-men animated adventures, but certainly fast enough to keep me watching and developed the plot steadily.  The tease of the end credits and some brief cameos and mentions paint a picture of an X-men universe that any fan would be curious to explore.  If you're a fan, young or old, you'll want to see it.",1338422400,2,3808,4.535871156661786
5056242,1,B007549XLG,"Im a HUGE Madhouse fan, but this movie isn't worth purchasing. Mad House's ""A"" team of animators only did the first 3 episodes before the now typical bait and switch happened and the whole thing goes south. The story is ok, typical stuff but if you want the whole package DONT buy this thing.",1337990400,7,292,4.425925925925926

There was one ludicrous sequence where the X-Men retreat to a cabin to shelter from a blizzard! Huh??Storm can control the weather so why didn't she just'zap'it or something! That's probably me just being picky but it bugged me!
Anyway,let's hope the second season continues with the amazing animation,ramps up the plot a bit more & throws in some more familiar/interesting villains from X-Men's history.",1337990400,2,557,4.9361702127659575

Excellent design/art.  Storyline was super, wide display of characters.  Whole DVD centers around one problem, so you don't get parts and pieces missing.  You get the full attention of what was made.  Keep in mind, if you don't like Anime: Inu-Yasha, Gungrave, Full Metal Alchemist, etc you might not like this flavor of X-Men.  Don't compare this to the 90s or Avengers Earth's Mighties Heroes cartoons, it's not...it's anime.

5056247,5,B007549XLG,"The story isn't bad but if the individual is a new comer he or she might find themselve lost due to the series starting off in the middle of the action. Also, the series doesn't take enough time going into the origin of the X-men. Nevertheless, if you're a veteran of the X-men comics and 90s TV show, I believe this is a great addition to the X-men franchise. My only complaint is that it was way too short, and I didn't like the way storm was protrayed. Moreover, I believe the X-men anime had more pros than cons. Don't listen to these people because they are extremely biased. I will give it 4.5 stars out of 5 for the slick animation combined with the different approach that was taken with the X-men anime...Furthermore, if the X-men was your cup of tea, I suggest picking up Iron Man the anime and Woverine when it comes out, although Woverine is one of the weakiest out of the three remakes.",1335916800,,899,4.357142857142857
5056248,3,B007549XLG,"I guess my main issue with this X-men series is the depiction of Storm. A popular and favorite character of the X-men, Storm's character in the anime was considerably underrated. First, I took issue with the fact that her eyes are ""brown"" rather than blue, which should not have been difficult for the writers to adopt. This redesign completely offset the historical appearance of Storm of which most comic readers are familiar. Even the animated version of X-men that originally aired on FOX had this part right. Secondly, Storm is also considered to be a mutant with ""omega-level"" potential, and one of the most powerful mutants in the Marvel Universe. How is it that after every skirmish she is nearly depleted of energy, retreating to hide behind walls to recuperate (see episode ""Armor"")? Seriously, this is a mutant who has taken out a hundred sentinels in a series of lightning strikes without so much as breaking a sweat.

As for the series as a whole, it was okay. The artwork was well done and as another reviewer mentioned, the battle scenes were visually appealing. I'm glad that I have this version in my collection of animated comic series.",1335657600,3,1154,4.828282828282828
5056249,1,B007549XLG,"The X-men anime really did not include anything new or interesting. The plots here have been done repeatedly in the older cartoons and movies.

5056250,4,B007549XLG,The series looks great with the anime treatment.

Although I still think that the original 90's animated series will always be the best, the anime series did well with story and character dynamics.
