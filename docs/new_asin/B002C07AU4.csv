3902518,5,B002C07AU4,"Normally I wait for a few reviews before I buy, but could not wait so I bought this set (I'm not sure the store should have had them out yet). Great prints this time, as good as Restless Gun. Stories are typical westerns and not as mature as Restless Gun. The quality of prints making these very enjoyable to watch. I think one of the best of this age out there. A release this old unfortunately has not the demand to put out a season by season. Being this is about a fourth of the shows a complete series would be about $240. I am a fan of these westerns of the 50's and 60's. The ""best of"" works great for me as long as there is a least 40 shows. But I would have liked to have all of the Restless Gun shows. Riverboat, 6 would have been enough. I'm glad for these releases from Timeless. Beware of any early color, as Laramie is only so-so.",1246665600,43,843,4.053892215568863

3902520,5,B002C07AU4,"Tales of Wells Fargo is an American Western television series that ran from March 18, 1957 to June 2, 1962 on NBC --- Set in the mid-1800s, the series starred Dale Robertson as special agent Jim Hardie, noted at the time as ""the left-handed gun"". The concept of the Wells Fargo series, a company troubleshooter in the American West --- Produced by Revue Productions, the series aired in a half-hour format until its final season when it expanded to an hour --- For its first two years, the show was also in the top ten Nielsen Ratings. During the 1957-58 season, it was ranked No. 3. --- Check out 46 Classic Episodes on 6 DVD Discs with some of the best character actors in the business.

Dale Robertson, the actor who made his name in television Westerns in the 1950s and '60s, was born on July 14, 1923, in Harrah, Oklahoma. After serving in a tank crew and in the combat engineers in North Africa and Europe during World War II, the twice-wounded Robertson started his acting career while still on active duty in the U.S. Army. While stationed at San Luis Obispo, California, had a photograph taken for his mother. A copy of the photo displayed in the photo shop window attracted movie scouts, and the six foot tall, 180-lb. Roberson soon was on his way to Hollywood. Will Rogers Jr., whose father is the most famous son of Oklahoma, told him to avoid formal training and keep his own persona

""Don't ever take a dramatic lesson,"" Rogers told him. ""They will try to put your voice in a dinner jacket, and people like their hominy and grits in everyday clothes."" Robertson took his advice and avoided acting classes.

Robertson was typecast in Western movies and TV shows when the genre was still America's favorite. He headlined two TV series, ""Tales of Wells Fargo"" (1957), in which he played the roving trouble-shooter Jim Hardie, and ""The Iron Horse"" (1966), in which he won a railway in a poker game. He also served as one of the hosts, along with Ronald Reagan, of the syndicated series ""Death Valley Days"" (1952) during the 1960s. Robertson later appeared in the inaugural season of ""Dynasty"" (1981).

Inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1983 --- Robertson is a recipient of the Golden Boot Award in 1985 --- He is retired on a ranch near Oklahoma City, not far from his birthplace of Harrah. (imd.com)

No one pile of horse droppings or the town cleaner with his barrel on wheels and shovel cleaning it up. They all missed that fact. All the bar fights in the street, one guy should have landed in a pile as common sense says, it had to happen. The streets were too clean, even in the big movies not one dropping.

These shows are all black & white but the quality is excellent & the black & white is more open & BRIGHT than todays so-called murky, dark disgusting color. We are certainly living in very dark & dismal times, at least that is what the powers to be want to translate to us. Also, by the way, each episode ENDS with a wonderful & complete story line. It is not a psychological Soap Opera which keeps you hanging from show to show, leaving you completely dissatisfied & wanting more.

3902559,4,B002C07AU4,"I actually bought this dvd for a friend of mine, who had grown up watching this series and I knew it had made a big impression on him. As for myself, I'd never seen the series, but had been a fan of Dale Robertson through his later series, 'The Iron Horse'.
I have to say, I've enjoyed the episodes I've watched so far. They're well made and adequately acted with a more adult content than other half-hour series I've seen from that period. There's also a catchy, rousing theme tune.
The only thing I disliked about the series - and it's to do with personal taste - is that the hero, Jim Hardie acts as narrator in every episode.
However, I'd fully recommend this dvd if you just want a flavour of the series. You won't be disappointed. It might help you make up your mind whether to buy the complete seasons, which, I understand, are also available on dvd.

3902580,5,B002C07AU4,"I recently purchased the ""Tales of Wells Fargo"" dvds, the entire show history from the sixties, starring Dale Robertson.  Dale Robertson is one of the few Western stars of the era who could actually sit a horse.  I loved watching the shows, then and now, to enjoy seeing him on a horse, and moving around horses, becuase it is clear he actually knows something about horses and how to handle them.

One thing I noticed about the series in re-watching it 40 years after the fact, is that the scripts are interjected with morals, and little anecdotes about how truth and justice win out. Even the outlaws were acknowledged for their bonds of keeping their word when it counted. It was interesting to see these shows again, in view of how different television is today.

Dale Robertson is still an all-around good guy in my book. He had great looks and sex appeal, as well as a nice narrating voice, all of which I enjoy just as much today as when the shows were new.",1291420800,12,964,4.491428571428571

Dale Robertson was perfect for the part and his voice over narration at beginning and end of show adds class and substance to the episodes. The man knew how to ride a horse. And a handsome mount they gave him to work with. About half way through the 40 odd episodes and have enjoyed everyone. And is a real kick to see actors performing in these episodes that went on to stardom in later years.

The only gripe I would have is the current $60 price for the boxed set. I bought it at a significant price reduction a few weeks back from Amazon and am well pleased with the value received. However before the temporary, it seems, reduction, I was hesitant to expend the funds and had ""saved for later"" in my cart for several months. Not saying it's not worth the current price, because I think it is, but it was sure a great deal at the lower one.",1280275200,5,990,4.26595744680851

The only problem is 46 episodes of the first five seasons isn't enough, this collection has left me wanting the rest, any chance?",1274486400,5,307,4.482142857142857

3902587,4,B002C07AU4,"Wells Fargo worldwide should have as its crest a picture of Dale Robertson with the stage coach because as far as I'm concerned,Dale is Wells Fargo and most of todays society will associate one with the other. I personally liked the half hour B&W shows better, and I hope the studios put out the entire seasons in chonological order, but overall, this is a nice addition to anyones collection who remembers W.F. from the 50's and 60's.",1270166400,11,435,4.662337662337662
3902588,2,B002C07AU4,"The first 4 years of imaginative and action-packed B&W episodes were much better.  This final color season (expanded from 30 to 60 minutes) was a disappointment.  The combination of a recurring supporting cast (who frequently over-acted), the tiring backdrop of Jim Hardy's ranch & nearby town, and a drawn-out (sometimes silly) story-line resulted in a boring TV experience.  I devoured the B&W boxed set of earlier episodes, but couldn't get past the first two discs here.  Even Dale Robertson (whom I love) couldn't rescue the series.  Sorry, my expectations were much higher.",1268611200,22,579,5.25
3902589,5,B002C07AU4,"The stories from the 1st season of Wells Fargo are great!  The endings are typical of that time period, where Dale Robertson always solves the case and it is done quickly. The dvd's seem to have a loud humming from time to time, but it goes away after 30 seconds. Other than that, these dvd's are worth buying!",1264982400,4,310,4.344827586206897

3902592,2,B002C07AU4,"It is a shame that they spoiled a great western series with this format. The original series was one of the greatest westerns ever produced. The stories from the color season was mixed with things that had no business being in there. All the stories seened to drag on due to the hour format and the larger cast. It would have been better to show the Jim Hardie homelife now and then but not every week. The took the original producer, writers, and directors out of the loop.",1258243200,10,474,4.3977272727272725

3902599,5,B002C07AU4,"At last, the half hour episodes of ""Tales of Wells Fargo"" on DVD. I was really pleased with this box set. The episodes have been remastered in sharp, pristine black and white and comes in attractive packaging with the six discs in seperate compartments (not stacked on top of each other!)This was a superior western, action in every episode, good stories and Dale Robertson's narration often giving interesting historical facts. Jim Hardie (the fastest left handed gun in the west)is a tough character, but also displays humour and compassion. Dale Robertson was well cast and actually sounds like a genuine cowboy. The one thing that puzzles me is the theme music. All these episodes contain the earlier theme, so when was the theme composed by Stanley Wilson and Mort Green introduced to the series? Also was the song version by the Prairie Chiefs ever used in the series? If someone can help with the theme music query please?? Otherwise, ""Tales of Wells Fargo"" is well worth purchasing. You will not be disapointed.",1254009600,10,1019,4.930232558139535
3902600,5,B002C07AU4,Many of the series that we  grew up with  as a child have  an appeal to see again as an adult.  Unfortunately  some memories prove to be better than actually seeing the show again.  I am pleased to say that this is not the case with Tales of Wells Fargo.  Dales acting and the stories tend to be as good as we recall  them.  Timeless Media group has done a good job of restoring this classic western.
