8325483,1,B000NO1ZWK,"I was highly anticipating the arrival of the Pomeranian dvd.  I must say I was very disappointed in the dvd.  The section on the Pomeranian was barely 20 minutes long, and was mainly showing some guy talking about the basics that we already know while shown with a Pomeranian as a prop.  They show a few scenes involving the same dog in each not really illustrating any point.

The so called ""free bonus"" footage of the training was a general training of dogs and was not even useful.  They didn't even show the trainer working with the Pomeranian breed!  The footage showed a long drawn out method of dog training that would confuse any dog, not train it.  Definitely not your traditional way of training a dog.  Utilizing hand signals and spoken commands go together not separately in the training process, and any moron knows that.

The other ""free bonus"" footage shows about 40 minutes or so of a doggie playdate with edited in barks and cheesy music, annoyingly so, and they don't even show the Pomeranian breed.  So totally juvenile.

I DO NOT recommend this for anyone not even complete beginners as this will surely have you end up with a very maladjusted and confused dog.

The BOTTOM LINE:

This is a very amateurish and poor attempt to capture the breed in all its essence.  Don't buy this as it is not worth the money!",1343433600,4,1330,4.580508474576271
