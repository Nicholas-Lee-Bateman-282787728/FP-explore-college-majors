2839833,5,B000QRIKF4,"I saw this Documentary when it originally aired years ago on ABC television. Many of the key figures from General Moore's and Joe Galloway's book and later movie ""We were Soldiers Once and Young"" were captured on film speaking frankly about their harrowing experiences in those terrible battles. The late Jack Smith, an ABC correspondent and veteran of the Landing Zone Albany battle shares his own emotional recollection of a desperate battle followed by a heart rending description of the horrible night on the battlefield that followed, listening to the enemy NVA soldiers moving about the battlefield in the dark, killing his fellow wounded soldiers. It is difficult for anyone who hasn't been in combat to understand what it really is, without the glorification and propaganda and it is documentaries such as this that manage to convey some of what it's really all about. I was very disappointed with the feature film that was made by Mel Gibson. I remember that he pledged to everyone that he would keep the film true to the book and he lied. While it was entertaining and had its moments, even General Moore lamented that his book got the ""Hollywood"" treatment in Gibson's movie. I am happy to see this documentary is available on DVD and will order it and I hope anyone who values the REAL story of these men will take the opportunity to purchase it as well- you won't regret it.",1261267200,5,1387,4.783333333333333
8197116,5,B000QRIKF4,"Excellent copy of this 1994 documentary.  Some of the reviews stated buyers had difficulty playing this produced on demand DVD by Amazon.  Works perfectly in my Blu-Ray player (which also came from Amazon).  I was well pleased with the quality of the video and audio considering how old the original was.  This 1993 ABC Documentary was well done (made in 1993 and first aired in 1994)..  Of course, some of the footage was from battlefield conditions, so it will naturally not be like what is possible in our 21st Century technology.  If you are a history buff, a Vietnam Veteran or just a fan of the recently deceased LTG Hal Moore, this is a must have for your historical collection.",1487635200,,685,4.666666666666667

8197118,5,B000QRIKF4,"Having servwd in Vietnam and having studied many battles we fought there. Nothing can compare with the battles at LZX X RAY
  and the massaacre at LZ ALBANY.  The loss of 305  American soldiers in three days is hard to believe. I did not fight in these particular
battles but my friend Frank who was at Albany, was that horrible day Nov. 17 1965. There has not been a time when we have coffee together.
That  he does not tear at the mere mention of LZ ALBANY.",1453420800,,459,4.2298850574712645

8197122,5,B000QRIKF4,"In this ABC special you actually get to see and hear some of the heroes from the Battle of the Ia Drang Valley battle including Moore and Galloway, the Lost Platoon, and the North Vietnames General.  I saw this special when it originally aired and thought it was a great book-end to the book ""We were Soldiers Once and Young""",1399420800,,325,4.416666666666667
8197123,5,B000QRIKF4,I'd seen this when it originally aired and bought the book We Were Soldiers Once And Young. In this special combatants from both sides revisit the battlefield in friendship. Although it's peaceful the horror of what those men experienced is evident as they walk the area and talk about the battle.,1389916800,,297,4.8431372549019605

8197125,5,B000QRIKF4,"This video is an excellent complement to We Were Soldiers Once and Young, both the book by General@Moore and the film with Mel Gibson.  It gives context to the Ia Drang battle and looks at the activities of some of the survivors on both sides who returned to the area 30 years later.  It contains photos and film taken at the battle of the Ia Drang and footage of American and Vietnamese survivors returning to the Ia Drang 30 years later.

Some of the scenes in the film are quite moving - for example, one man finds a US helmet with a bullet hole through it.  His friend in the battle had recieved a devastating head wound when a round went through his helment.  30 years on, his friend found the remnants of the helmet at the spot where he was hit.  It was a very moving moment, not just for the participant but also probably for viewers as well.

It is very interesting to see how the Vietnamese and US survivors of the battle got on.@It just reinforces the notion that in battle there is no winner or looser, just survivors. This program exemplifies this feeling very well.

I highly recommend this DVD to those with an interest in US and Vietnamese military history.",1288742400,3,1172,4.4186046511627906
