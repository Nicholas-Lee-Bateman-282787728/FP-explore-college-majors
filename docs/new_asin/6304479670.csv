888427,3,6304479670,"While certainly not as good as any of his 50s pictures (or even BLUE HAWAII), DOUBLE TROUBLE is certainly more watchable than TICKLE ME or HARUM SCARUM.
The plot is typical: Elvis falls for two women (that's certainly  been done before), and gets into some sort of conflict. This time it's  trying to save his girlfriend from her Uncle Gerald, who is after her  inheritance.
OK, the plot isn't much, but Elvis looks good in some of the  outfits he wears in this picture. The songs are not much either, especially  the horrid rendition of ""Old MacDonald"". The best songs are  ""Long Legged Girl"" and ""City By Night"".
At least this  is a picture in which I didn't cringe. The dialogue isn't quite as corny as  some of the other pictures, and it doesn't get too boring either.

888428,2,6304479670,"The Rebel-With-A-Heart-of-Gold-Who-Learns-The-Meaning-Of-Love scenario is put aside for a kind of soft spoof of spy pictures, which were very popular in the movies and on TV at that time. The ""European"" setting got  Elvis off the beach and away from the resorts but the script and direction  were basic, to say the least, and the music was uninspired and badly mixed  on record. The movie does have one of Presley's best set of opening  productiom numbers: ""Long Legged Girl.."" and others are rousing  tunes delivered with that Presley panache often missing from his late-'60s  efforts. But about 20 minutes into the picture even the most ardent fan  reaches for a magazine. An interesting sidelight is that his co-star was a  true ""discovery"" - an English teenager making her screen debut  with Elvis Presley! She handles the light-hearted assignment very well  indeed - even the ""Old MacDonald"" sequence which usually is  reprised on documentaries as a typically ludicrous excuse for a soundtrack  album cut.",959731200,2,1010,5.166666666666667

888569,4,6304479670,"A nice change of pace for the typical Elvis Movie. Try's  to update his films by having a London Mod look to it. All the cast looks like they should for 1967, except ELVIS, he stands out so much as the same clothes, hair and songs, while his band members are very current, ie London dialect , Mod clothes. But I liked the change of location and most of the songs. Just a week after he finished this film he went right into Easy Come Easy go, another to bring Elvis CURRENT, only here in the USA, again everybody is ""Hip"" as in 1967, again except Elvis. This story plot falls short of what they did in Double Trouble.

888682,4,6304479670,Sadly a little too late that the people behind Elvis were finally giving him some adult treatment. Also I believe that if Elvis had stood up to the movie brainiacs he could have gotten himself some quality movies to make. They tried with this and you would have thought to give it a lift they would have sent Elvis and cast to Europe instead of filming on the hollywood backlots. Sadly Elvis never realized the power he could have used to make more quality films. A wasted talent brought on by money hungry hanger ons.,1435190400,,518,4.463157894736842

888870,2,6304479670,"You really don't expect a terrific plot in an Elvis film.  Typically the story is innocent, light, and fun fluff, without a hint of impropriety, however that doesn't seem to be the case in Double Trouble (1967), where Presley's love interest is a seventeen years old.  Spoilers follow, so proceed as you will.

Presley is Guy Lambert, a singer in a rock band performing in England.  Unknown to Guy, Jill Conway (Annette Day) the girl he seems most interested in, is just seventeen.  The band is about to head over to Belgium, and Guy is looking to put some moves on Jill before he leaves, but the precocious youngster skips out of his flat, before he can commit any illegal acts.  After having a talk with Jill's uncle Gerald Waverly (John Williams), he discovers that she is just a few days short of her eighteenth birthday.

Jill has marriage on her mind, and boards Guy's ship bound for Belgium.  On the trip smugglers slip some jewels the singer's luggage.  Upon reaching port, Guy and the band head to Bruges to perform in a club.  Predictably, Jill shows up there, and in no time at all is up in Guy's hotel room, spinning stories that her uncle is cruel to her.  Guy agrees to take Jill to Stockholm, while the buffoonish smugglers are hanging around, trying to recover their hidden loot.

While in Antwerp, things take a dark turn.  Apparently Uncle Gerald has squandered away his niece's inheritance, and has sent someone to kill her.  Elvis has to break out his karate moves to defend Jill, as the attempted assassin ends up breaking his neck.  Guy is taken into police custody, where he is questioned by inspector de Groote (Leon Askin, General Burkhalter on Hogan's Heroes), as Gerald Waverly arrives on the scene.  The film's big finale features Guy's escape from the police station, and a lackluster chase through the town.

Elvis Presley met his future wife Priscilla Wagner in 1959 when she was 14, and eventually married her in 1967 about a month after Double Trouble was released.  As Presley had himself been romantically involved with a minor, and was not yet married, his decision to participate in a film that resembles his real life situation is somewhat baffling.  The whole storyline involving a minor would be a little dodgy, even for an actor with no personal baggage, but given his history, Presley's involvement in such a badly written effort, is more than a little strange.

Double Trouble is pretty much just for die hard Elvis fans.  The story is very weak, and the music isn't good either, as the King even sings Old MacDonald on the back of a truck.  Disappointingly, there are only two principal women in the film.  This remains Annette Day's only film, and while she may be handicapped because she is playing a minor, Day doesn't have the qualities you normally find in one of Elvis's leading ladies.  Yvonne Romain, who plays Gerald's girlfriend Claire Dunham, is the only other female with any major screen time.  Double Trouble is also available in a double feature with Spinout (1966) on a flipper disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spinout-Double-Trouble/dp/B0009UZG6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spinout/Double Trouble</a>.",1318204800,,3209,4.998116760828625
888871,2,6304479670,"Although ""Double Trouble"" was made a year before his famous ""NBC Comeback Special"", and there were yet some other bad movies in store for him, before his movie career finally came to an end, this is one perfect example of why his Actor's days were finally numbered.

In a way it revealed itself a blessing, since the plots became carbon copies of each other, in which all he had to do anyway, was to look smart and to sing songs. A thing he could do much better on a live stage.

""Double Trouble"" was a vehicle for the ""King"" for European audiences, just as ""G.I. Blues"" had attempted seven years earlier.
Unfortunately, this effort backfired and the movie had cold receptions in Europe, except maybe in Belgium, where the movie is supposed to take place.

Its plot is a typical cliched slapstick comedy with romance interwoven in it, here and there, just to allow Elvis to do what he was good at.

Banal and shabby, just meant for Elvis fans, it is a very forgettable movie, perhaps to join other bad movies like ""Change of Habit"", ""Harum Scarum"" and
""The Trouble with Girls"".

The transfer of it on DVD on the contrary, is very well done, with a very fine resolution and sharp colors. The sound also has been taken care of, and although conventional, sparkles for its clarity.

Just recommended for die-hard Elvis fans. For the others, I would recommend to stick to his earlier movies, such as ""Wild in the Country"" or ""King Creole"".",1252713600,2,1435,4.5859375

888946,5,6304479670,"This is my favorite Elvis 60's movie... the character is probably the closest Elvis ever played to himself, and he was so huge at this point and hating doing movies so much he didn't care if he came off as a jerk, so it's valuable from that point of view. Also, the go-go stuff is fantastic, a lot of Austin Powers came out of this movie. It moves quick, you never once really think you're in Europe, just great American quickie factory filmaking all around. Did they ever know how to light sets and make color pop! The music rocks, the strings Elvis hated on the blues tune ""There's So Much World To See"" are the best thing about the song, the opening theme is one of the best big band rock themes since ""The Delicate Delinquent"" starring Jerry Lewis, and you know Gillian Anderson's mother had to have seen this movie! And plenty of plot twists and turns which were highly unusual in any Elvis movie. Oh, and who can ever forget Elvis on the back of a fake chicken truck singing ""Old MacDonald"". Yeah, I know the Rolling Stone crowd puked, but that's exactly what made it great, and he and Annette looked like they were really having fun with it.

(As anyone who has actually watched the film would know... why ever would somebody post a review of a movie that they haven't even seen???)

The 'double' of the title is a dual reference to espionage (as in 'double agent') and the fact that the King - as is his won't  (or perhaps being even a little parsimonious by his normal standards!) - is involved throughout the story with two girls and thus, quite literally, has 'double trouble'.

There - just wanted the clear that up!

(By the way, the movie's not that bad.  Even the much derided 'Old Macdonald' scene has the kind of charm that only Elvis could possibly confer on such inherent rubbish.  Personally, as Elvis movies go, I'd give it 8 out of 10 for watchability!)",1187913600,,1110,4.465346534653466

Elvis doesn't sleepwalk through the proceedings, showing his adept flair for comedy. There are a few memorable songs (notably ""Long Legged Girl"") and the supporting cast is quite good.

It has a basically good soundtrack,""Baby,If You'll Give Me All Your Love"",""City By Night"",""Long-legged Girl"",""There's So Much World To See"",""Could I Fall In Love"",""I Love Only One Girl"",and ""Double Trouble"" are all good, with the exception of ""Old MacDonald"". I wouldn't say it was a ""horrid rendition"", but just the fact that this song is sung, period, makes it beyond ridiculous. I like, however, the fairly engaging plot, kind of a spy-spoof at times.

About the latter, the producer made the big mistake of hiring Annette Day to be Elvis's co-star in the film even though she had no acting experience whatever, and never pursued acting after ""Double Trouble,"" which shows since she's just kind of there but adds no sparkle to her role at all.  The movie is supposed to reflect the mod 1960s in Europe, but it doesn't capitalize on that, and the attempts at humor fall flat. There are a few decent songs, mainly ""City by Night"" and ""Long Legged Girl,"" although ""Old MacDonald"" is one of his worst movie songs. ""Double Trouble"" is near the bottom of the barrel of Elvis's films, although it's not quite as bad as ""Kissin' Cousins"" and ""Stay Away Joe,"" both of which manage to be not only bad but also offensive.",1472428800,,902,4.567901234567901
