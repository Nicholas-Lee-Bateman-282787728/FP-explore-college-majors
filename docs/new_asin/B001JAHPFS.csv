3654759,5,B001JAHPFS,"Arthur is so special to me, it came on early in the morning on school days, and I would always rush over and turn on the television, get my food and enjoy such a great show, and then...it was off to school for me. Arthur was a very unique children's show. Not only does it appeal to kids, but also to older men and women. And while Arthur has educational value, there's not too much that the kid would rather be playing outside. Nowadays, it saddens me how strict children's television is, watching these new television show are like being in a classroom but television is supposed to be entertainment. Arthur was so entertaining and has been enjoyed by kids and adults for thirteen years and still is going strong. And that's why I think it needs to be released on DVD. And yes I know there tons of Arthur DVD's, in fact there are over fifty DVD's, but they only have three stories. That's the equivalent of one half hour episode and a half, and they each cost around ten bucks! Now is that cheapskate or what, but alas, I could not wait for season one to be released so I've been buying these overpriced DVD's, but I would recommend to wait. I would like to say there is hope though. Seasons ten and eleven were released on DVD only two years ago.

In my opinion, the first four seasons are the best of Arthur, because of the terrific vocal performances by Michael Yarmush. (The voice of Arthur) He brought so much charm to the character and made him so enjoyable. And that's why Arthur season one should be released...what am I saying. The whole show should be released. Now if by some chance your reading this review you probably already know the plot of the show by now, so I won't get into that. The show came to be by Marc Brown, the creator of Arthur and was originally children's books, (Which I would recommend) and then the books became so popular that Arthur the television series was created. But that's not all; there are also three Arthur CD's and a spinoff ""Postcards from Buster.""

I think in the most recent seasons, the charm Arthur used to have is wearing off. He's started to sound younger and younger, and he sounds like he should be in first grade not third. Also, the jokes are starting to sound a little more childish (I know this is a kids show!) and the humor just hasn't been as...humouras. So after season eight, I quit watching it but it's still the best show out there for children. I think this is a great time for season one to be released, two seasons have already been released and it's been years since the show started. Why not release it on DVD, I mean if ""Sid the Science Kid"" is being released, I think they could take a little bit of time to release one of the most successful children shows of all time. Well, that's about all I have to say, so to wrap things up I'll post season one's episode listings below.
