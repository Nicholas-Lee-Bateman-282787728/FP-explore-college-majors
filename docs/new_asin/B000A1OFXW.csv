2350057,5,B000A1OFXW,THIS IS MY ONE OF MY FAVORITE OF CIRQUE DU SOLEIL!!!!!!!  I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT!  IT'S EXCITING!!!!!!,1247443200,,104,4.421052631578948
2350058,3,B000A1OFXW,"Well, I'm not going to lose my temper, because Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, and has the legal right to express it.
But in the meantime, I would like to retake the above comment regarding the ANNIVERSARY SHOW, performed by Cirque du Soleil (for which I may speak as a Really huge fan - I've seen EVERYTHING, including KOOZA, Wintuk , Zaia and Zed (yes, I've been in Macau and Tokio for this only purpose!) and I'll be in Vegas in October for Criss Angel's Believe...
So, I tend to agree partially to my colleague fan about this show -which I had the joy of watching in Montral, for the Jazz Festival.
The Show
I recently took in a show of ""La Nouba,"" Cirque du Soleil's Orlando show, and it was a reminder of why a live performance is always better than a recorded one. The energy and the excitement of watching people performing with out an editing net is far superior than the canned power of a TV drama. Ironically, sometimes when you film a live show, it's even less engaging than the taped version. Such is the case with ""Midnight Sun.""

As part of the 2004 anniversary celebration for the Montreal Jazz Festival, Cirque du Soleil put together a blowout musical performance with that twist of spectacle that's the trademark of the troupe's shows. Bombastic world music crashes together with acrobats, fire swallowers and numerous dancers to create a kinetic display that's spread across a stage and a lengthy runway that juts out into a teeming crowd in the night of Montreal.

That's bound to sound great to any fan of the Cirque, but this is not the Cirque fans have grown to love. Likely because it's part of the Jazz Festival, this show is focused primarily on the music that is such a big part of the troupe. Sure, there are parts that are familiar, like the silk-scarf acrobats and the loosely constructed storyline that holds things together. But they don't have the level of power and emotion that the other show's hold. Instead, it feels like a concert with some stunts thrown in.
One of the other problems with the show is the size. Something I've noticed in previous shows is the intimate nature of the performance space. In this case, a crowd of over 200,000 people and a ""stage"" as big as three city blocks makes what is otherwise larger than life into something significantly smaller. This especially hurts the way the acrobat's performances are perceived. There's also the matter of the stage, which is so miniscule that the performers can barely move more than a few feet. The German Wheel, which is normally full of momentum and speed, is limited to the precision movements that, while impressive, aren't that exciting.

On the plus side, the music is as good as it's ever been, the costumes are stunning and the stunts that are present are good ones. For a fan of Cirque's music, this is a perfect package, but for the average Cirque fan, it can frankly be a bit boring. It's unfortunate, as I've had nothing but good things to say about their DVDs to this point. In fact, I can't truly say this is a bad DVD, as it may just be a matter of taste. But when you build your reputation with one style and switch to another, you have to expect the fans might feel a bit cheated.
The DVD
The 95-minute show is packaged on one DVD, which comes in a standard keepcase with a two-sided insert that's mainly promotional. The disc opens with a choice of menu language, English or French, leading into an animated anamorphic widescreen main menu that offers a choice to play the show or view the special features. There are 5.1 and 2.0 audio tracks available, but only through your remote, and there are no subtitles or closed captioning. There's not much in terms of dialogue anyway.

The Quality
The anamorphic widescreen video of this show is just about brilliant. That's never been a problem for Cirque DVDs. Despite a setting that's not exactly perfect--at night, outside, in a crowd of 200,000 people--the footage is crisp, with nice color and excellent detail. Considering the amount of action going on in some shots, that it isn't a muddy pixilated mess is an impressive feat. Per my reader, the video is cranking at 9Mbps, which makes me surprised that this isn't listed as a SuperBit title like the recent Cirque releases from Sony.

The audio, presented in Dolby Digital 5.1, is strong and clear, with bass-heavy music that pounds through the speakers. There's nothing in terms of panning or directionality that will make you say ""Ahhh"", but its all well-produced, making for an enjoyable listen, which is the most important thing with a show like this.

The Extras
There are three extras, though one is the now traditional Cirque promo piece that's found on every one of the troupe's DVDs, so it really shouldn't count. The other two are just disappointing. One is the show's encore, a four-minute song that's repetitive and really kind of boring, with the singers just standing at the end of the stage runway. As a side benefit though, you get to see what Cameron Diaz might look like in 15 or so years.

The other bonus is a photo slide show, set to music from the show, that runs just over a minute. The pictures change rapidly, so there's plenty to look at, but the photos aren't of the highest quality. It's going to be of limited interest to most.
The Bottom Line
Those who tune into Cirque du Soleil for its unique blend of art, music and action might find themselves disappointed by ""Midnight Sun."" As part of the Montreal Jazz Festival, this show is focused first on the music, and doesn't push the envelope in terms of the more circus-based portions of the show. Myself, I found it lacking because of that. The DVD presentation is wonderful when it comes to the audio and video, but there are next to no extras to support the main show. Of all the Cirque du Soleil DVDs, this is probably the least purchase worthy that I've seen, though the music is as beautiful as ever.

I'm not so hard on the show producers as my colleague, but I'm afraid I'll have to agree withhim in a final point: this is a DVD for Cirque du Sleil nuts - like me, or him!",1219968000,,6089,4.574702108157654
2350059,3,B000A1OFXW,"Midnight Sun is watchable and even enjoyable if you can fast foward through the boring lackluster dancing and the boring and weird acrylic wall dancing (WHAT IS THAT???). I really gave this a chance because it looked so innovative but after a while it become down right embarrasing.

The aerial acts and wheel balancing were breathtaking and I loved the music and singing.  I suspect that much of the uneveness of this production is that is was a one of a kind performance and not refined for touring.  Some of it had a thrown together atmosphere.  Also, it was certainly much more fun to be there in the audience.

An uneven but interesting show worth a look as long as you are not expecting another Varekai.",1153958400,4,709,4.595238095238095
2350060,3,B000A1OFXW,"This was part of the Montreal Jazz festival. Not much cirque on this dvd, and not one of my favorites, more music but remember this was done outside, and there was not much else you can do at a jazz festival .So if your looking more for cirque get one of the other dvds.",1151452800,3,270,4.018518518518518
2350061,4,B000A1OFXW,"In order to appreciate this DVD, I think you have to see it more as a concert than a typical Cirque performance.  As a live, outdoor concert, it works.  The DVD captures the excitement of the crowd and if you especially enjoy the Euro-music of Cirque, this one's for you.  It is light on acrobatics, but visually interesting, and the music is (overall) great.  It can't compare with Varekai or Allegria; it's not that kind of show.  I don't get the negativity of the other reviews, but we all have our subjective opinions.  I'm glad I got this one.",1151020800,17,548,4.484848484848484
2350062,1,B000A1OFXW,"First of all, I am a huuuuuuge Cirque du Soleil fan.  I have virtually all of the DVDs and several of the soundtracks.  Even my MySpace page is themed after it.  My favorite shows are Alegria, Varekai, Quidam, La Nouba and even Saltimbanco and Dralion were good.  Corte was probably my least favorite... until now that is.  I was very eager to watch this show but oh was I disappointed. :(

One of the reasons I love Cirque du Soleil so much is the lovely music and wonderful artistic displays and costumes.  This show butchered just about everything I thought was so cool about Cirque du Soleil and they managed to pull it off all in one night.  Someone was either high or passed the buck to some other group to put this disastrous piece of show together.  If I were the founder of Cirque du Soleil, I'd take this DVD outa print and spare the embarrassment.

Like the other reviewer, I agree, the performers looked like adults throwing tantrums and the Plexiglas wall was just too much.  Aah the French. ;)  Most of the performers failed to maintain a presence of character.  They simply looked like people performing a bad routine that was thrown together at the last minute and so they were trying hard not to screw it up.  There's very little expression or emotion conveyed through any of their actions or expressions (except to see them out of character and smirking and chatting with each other) and, as a result, you don't buy into the fantasy or emotional experience that Cirque du Soleil is so famous for creating.

Unfortunately, I also hated the music with only a few small exceptions.  The singers were mostly terrible; often off key, and what's with the chick dressed up like Paris Hilton?  Or how `bout ""stick in her hair lady""???  How in the world did she get a singing job in the show?  Wow!  The orchestra was also sub-par on many performances.  The horn section was often out of tune (yes - out of tune) and the band just wasn't together.  I was really disappointed. :(

The good performances were the guy on the German Wheel (from Quidam), The Statue: Vis Versa, which is the muscley couple that contort and balance each other in weird positions (also from Quidam - they were in perfect character), a few of the singers were ok (including Francesca Gagnon), and some of the backup dancers kept in character.  Other than these few exceptions it was lackluster entirely.  Even the lighting, fireworks and smoke was a disappointment in their presentation.  I've seen better open air rock concerts than this and this was supposed to be their 20 year anniversary show.  Sigh.

Parents should note that there's a bit more ""sex appeal"" in this show (nothing extreme at all and no nudity but a little racy - hey, it's French), but there are worse reasons than that to make you want to hide yours and your children's eyes and ears from this awful performance.  I'm sorry to be so negative but the show really bummed me out.  The tango scene near the beginning of the show did not flow.  Uh, you might say it was ""lusty"" but it wasn't passionate or expressive of emotion and it just was some really crappy dancing.  Fortunately, my DVD player has fast forward where you can hear the audio at high speed too (and the pitch doesn't change), so the best part was watching boring performances disappear quickly. ;)

Dare I go on?  Ok, you talked me into it.  They destroyed just about every song they performed except a couple, which were adequate.  Perhaps some of that is due to a limitation of the size of this live performance so I'll give the sound crew their fair share of the blame and just the natural complexity of such a massive coordinated event, but this show just didn't connect like so many of the others.  The song Alegria was decent in this show (and carried some emotion), though not as good as the DVD performance.  Francesca Gagnon (a.k.a. The Singer in White) was lovely on Alegria, but not at her peak here - I still enjoyed her performance though).  Her version of Querer was, unfortunately, not good at all (in my opinion). :(  I would much rather recommend her new solo CD than this DVD any day.

All in all I would not even recommend this show as a rental (even to diehard Cirque fans).  It was not entertaining.  It will not be watched again in my collection. :(  How's that for a review?  I'm just being honest.  Save your money and buy one of the good DVD shows like Alegria, La Nouba, Varekai, or Quidam.  Even the earlier DVD's before the show reached the level of sophistication they are at today are much more enjoyable to watch than this!  Even better, go to a live performance!

1 generous star, and that's only because I love Francesca Gagnon's beautiful voice and there were a couple of fair moments, but over all this is a horrible show - certainly not something you would want to give to a friend to introduce them to Cirque du Soleil.",1149811200,31,4878,4.5326460481099655
2350063,5,B000A1OFXW,I bought this DVD with high expectations and they were met and more. Weather you want to see amazing stunts or hear great music I highly recommend this DVD. Cirque Du Soleil fans new and old will enjoy this DVD.,1144108800,,211,4.3
2350064,1,B000A1OFXW,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!

This show does not even come close to the Cirque standard of performance that I have been witness to in the past. Had this been the first Cirque video that I had seen, I don't think I would have ever watched another. It seemed just thrown together. It didn't flow at all.

The performances were terrible. The dancers looked more like adults throwing tantrums than the lovers I assumed they were supposed to be. One performance looked like someone literally going crazy inside a box slightly larger than a coffin. Another performance was acrobats throwing themselves repeatedly into a plexi glass wall.  I just didn't find them appealing at all.

This video was almost painful to watch. I kept thinking that it just had to get better. It did, about an hour in. And by that point there was only half an hour left.

The music was still good. I think if I keep this video, I will hook up my stereo to the DVD player and turn the TV off. So if you're looking for great background music, this would be a good dvd to buy. If you are looking for a good Cirque show, I would recommend any of their other DVDs.  Either way, I would strongly suggest renting it BEFORE you buy it.",1143849600,3,1188,4.401826484018265
2350065,5,B000A1OFXW,"I enjoyed VAREKAI for its offhandedness, did you know the title means ""Whatever"" in the Romany language, the legendary tongue of the Gypsies?  You can also watch a sort of ""REAL WORLD VAREKAI Also, La Nouba, which was filmed inside, in a theater at Walt Disney World, with a lot of wire work like Hong Kong action movies with Jet Li-only Jet Li fails to make an appearance and it looks sort of Vegasy and schlocky, without the childlike wonder of some previous Cirque du Soleil shows.  Even Alegria was better, the Australian extravaganza that used some optical shtick that made it very different.  On the one hand, the increased used of video projections makes for better TV, and on the other, sometimes it's hard to see what's live and what was added in post-production.  On DVD, you can slow the action to a crawl, and sometimes you see things you weren't supposed to.

I wondered what it would be like to be present at the taping of one of the Cirque de Soleil spectacles that come out every year, so when I heard that they were going to be filming on the streets of Montreal, I packed my travel clothes and bags and headed for the hills-literally, for the beautiful city is ringed with hills and you see the streets jammed pack with tourist types in stupid T-shirts and open mouthed spectators, many of us eating those French fries dipped in vinegar.  Meanwhile the spectacular tightrope stunts and fire walking and acrobats were whizzing about our heads, and the thunderous music that sounds like Vangelis at top volume was echoing in our ears as day turned to night, red streaks in the sky, and a young man edging a chair across a thin rope of steel, instinctively you turned to make sure you were not under him, so precarious was his position.

Cirque Du Soleil is unique in that it is a collaborative effort, without any ""star-making machinery,"" and individual performers are downplayed in favor of anonymous and heavily costumed ensembles.  Even if you could recognize a particular actor (and how could you when they're all in makeup worthy of Kabuki) you might nor recognize him next time around.  Due to this limitation, you don't look forward year to year to seeing your favorites because there aren't any, and due to this also, the shows are pretty short.  MIDNIGHT SUN's total presentation, I imagine, isn't much longer than an hour and half.  But you'll be rubbing your eyes with delight for a long time after.

But it is not from 1988!  It is much more recent than that!  Must be an error on Amazon's part.",1126137600,8,2523,4.62780269058296

The performer on the double wheel is the biggest exception, but even here, the poor videography (despite the obviously high-end camera equipment) of the whole show mars even this high point of the show.  The editing leaves many dull moments and often cuts away from the better performances, breaking any building suspense.  The music is fair.

And of these, not very many were the sort that left you in awe or wonder, thinking ""they must have taken years of practice to get that right!""

A few previous acts are revisited, but in some cases, acts that were graceful and flowing are turned into little more than angry, aerial thrashing.  A good many of the performance arts bits are more remeniscient of the National Endowment for the Arts than of Cirque du Soleil.

I did have to keep in mind that this is a wide-open street performance, so that limits things a lot from the outset.  A typical Cirque is a complete, packaged, immersive environment that surrounds and encompasses an audience; wrapping them warmly in a complete embrace.

This is none of that.  There's no warmth of Alegria.  There's no forboding, somber, darkness of Quidam.  There's no intensity of Varekai.
