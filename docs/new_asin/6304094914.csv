7861123,5,6304094914,"I watched this movie in the late 90's and wanted the DVD. I suspect I am in the minority who believes this is a fun movie that combines action, drama and comedy. I searched for a long time for the DVD and thankfully I at least received an excellent VHS copy. The dialog between Yancy and Matt McCoy is some of the best I have watched in a long time. This movie has a number of twists and turns and tons of action. Great roles by the supporting cast. I love the movie and highly recommend it to anyone looking for about 90 minutes of suspense, action, comedy and beautiful scenery. The score is also very very good.
