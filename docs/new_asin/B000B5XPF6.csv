2402678,5,B000B5XPF6,I was terrified by this movie.  I love horror movies and this one is one of the best that I have seen in a while.  The scenes are ultra frightening and the story is very good.  This movie eclipses many of the big budget films to come out lately.  I have already watched it twice and it is just as scary the second time around.,1129680000,,326,3.9692307692307693
2402679,5,B000B5XPF6,"When I recieved a copy of this movie I was skeptical, I thought that it was going to be a cheesy slasher movie with no plot but it turned out to be nothing of the sort.  Rockville Slayer instead turned out to be a terrifying and intense film.  The plot was deep and the characters kept me involved.  This movie is so much more that a b slasher flick.  I would totally recomend this film to any of my friends.",1129680000,,408,4.0625
2402680,5,B000B5XPF6,I was enough to get an advanced screening of this movie and I loved it.  The story was inventive and had a way better plot than I anticipated.  I found myself both scared and entertained.  This movie holds up to some of the classic horror pictures of all time.  You will not be disappointed.,1129680000,,291,4.333333333333333
2402681,5,B000B5XPF6,"One of the better horror movies that you will see.  There is a clear storyline, scenes that will curdle your blood.  The director, Mr. Selz, makes ingenious usage of an unused Illinois prison to add realism to the movie.  I don't want to give out details-this is a must see for any horror fan.  I look forward to more from this director. His passion for the horror genre shows in every scene and in each and every detail. In each scene you find yourself expecting something sinister to happen and it does. Great Great Flick",1129334400,,523,4.473684210526316
2402682,3,B000B5XPF6,"I had the opportunity to watch The Rockville Slayer before it was released.  If you are expecting this to be a no brainer slasher film you will be let down.  The Rockville Slayer has more to offer.  The film starts out like your typical teen slasher film.  Four high school couples making out in parked cars in a secluded hot spot of a small town.  The guys are on walkie-talkies and have some really funny dialogue between them.  You even get some skin from a nice looking blond cheerleader.  A killer stalks them and from that point on the story goes in a different direction.  There are things from the past that come back and have a connection with the murders.  A goofy named actor, Circus, plays and looks the role of an earlier Anthony Perkins from Psycho.  Everything comes together at the end.  Robert Z'Dar, in my opinion, makes one hell of a twisted statement in this film.  Some of the actors were less seasoned than others and it shows from time to time.  Linnea Quigley's character as Mary Burns, is more than just your typical screaming blonde bimbo.  The dream scenes in the sanitarium really gave me the chills.  You see and hear some eerie things.  Overall, this was a catchy little film that offers something different.  Worth a watch!",1128902400,,1254,4.576576576576577
2402733,1,B000B5XPF6,"Let me see.... Bad Script, Bad acting, bad directing, poor editing, Soundtrack like a bad Japanese Western. So what's to like?? This DVD was an effort to recoup a bad investment..... save your $20 for a REAL Charity !!!",1147737600,2,219,4.641025641025641
2402734,1,B000B5XPF6,"My rating for The Rockville Slayer would have been a 2.5 stars or around there.  I'm farily new to Amazon reviews but even I could tell that most (or all) of the 5 star reviews here are fakes.  There's so much refrence to how great the director or the script is and how great the film is that it's all just got to be done by friends or family or even the director himself.  How dumb does he think we all are?  But anyway, the movie isn't that bad.  It has some good parts and there's even a modicum of suspense here and there.  But beware: the movie breaks down, literally, about 3/4 way into it, the sound goes off and you watch the last part of the movie like a bad Japanese children's monster film with the voices, sounds and lip movements all way off.  Anyone who gave this 5 stars and didn't mention this is a big phoney.  I like Linnea Quigley and Robert Zdar is always creepy.  They aren't great in this avg. film but they always lend a good b movie air to things.",1143676800,6,971,4.122340425531915
2402735,2,B000B5XPF6,"The one aspect of this movie preventing it from being a Dudley Crap recipient is the fact that with a little more budget, this movie could have been a lot more credible. The low budget is so painfully obvious from moment one that it is hard to keep it out of your mind as you watch it. Rockville Slayer has a decent amount of plot and dramatic devices going for it and Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's brother) does an admirable job as the sherriff and keeps the other actors well grounded, but ultimately the film's many plot points come up feeling slight because of the budgetary constraints. The cover artwork and description lead you to believe this is just another slasher kill fest, but that is not the case. Its a decent enough mystery that in spite of its'low budget keeps you somewhat interested throughout. Rockville Slayer is certainly a cut above many other low budget trash horror on the market.

Story:3.5 stars Acting: 3 stars Budget: 1 star. Overall rating: 2.25 stars",1135468800,,979,4.658959537572255
2402736,3,B000B5XPF6,"I love this type of slasher flick: no name-brand actors, no big budget, good acting and an interesting story that is more than T & A being sliced and diced. One has to place more emphasis on the acting, when there are no elaborite scenes and special effects. I counted about three separate stories within the stroy that all seemed to blend with the murder of the young kids in the beginning of the movie. The people in this movie looked normal: NO STUNNING BEAUTIES WITH EXTRA  LARGE BRESTS, NO SEXIEST MAN OF THE YEAR CANDIDATES FOR PEOPLE MAGAZINE, just plain everyday looking people.

The story is one of revenge and a lunatic erasing the past. I really hope there are not kids out there as stupid as the four in the beginning. It was kind of not credible that in the midst of having sex with two beautiful girls, that teen boys would be radioing each other for status reports while bragging about there performance in the last football game. Other than that, the movie was well made, directed and told the story it wanted to tell. The killer with the big face is probably typecast in these types of rolls and continues to do an excellent job. Had the deputy and the detective gotten romantically involved, at the end, this would have made for a better ending. Either he could have stayed or she could have went with him, had the director made thier relationship to blossom more during the movie.

All in all a good movie. I  have paid more fore worse. This one was pretty good.",1132790400,2,1481,4.474074074074074
2402737,1,B000B5XPF6,I would give this movie a 0 if it were my choice. A big fat 0. The reviews before me must be family or have some kind of connection! Bad bad bad the words would come out and you would see their mouths move latter. It was so stupid that I can't believe I got suckered again. Don't waste the time and don't get ripped off like I did...,1132531200,6,333,3.8405797101449277
2402738,5,B000B5XPF6,"this dvd really caught me suprise, when i first popped it in the dvd player i wasn't expected a movie like this. Usually movies with the word ""slasher"" give you just that, but instead this movie entices you in a garden full questions, and you'll be scratching your head through most of it (in a good way). I guess what im trying to say is this movie definately is reserved and paces itself extremely well, so you  aren't bored before the opening credits finish.",1131494400,2,461,4.488095238095238
2402739,5,B000B5XPF6,"The rockville horror is not like your typical slasher flick, it deals alot with psychological issues, and leaves you disturbed by the time the movie is over. I loved the movie personally, and i think this movie would be great for anyone who enjoys thrillers with twists and turns.",1131494400,2,280,4.73469387755102
2402740,5,B000B5XPF6,"making this movie. he could of done alot of things differently, but for this genre i think it matched wonderfully. I thoroughly enjoyed the opening scene with the teenagers making out in the car, which even though may seem cliche, is entirely different once you see it. Dialogue was scripted very well, and i liked the scene locations selected by the producers. I highly recommend the rockville slayer, and would definately see it for a third or a fourth time.",1131408000,2,460,4.7625
2402741,5,B000B5XPF6,"i honestly got this movie because i thought the box art was pretty cool, but after seeign the movie i have to say it was better than i expected. What i liked most was the cinematography as it took an unconventional approach to the horror genre, with precise angles heightening the fear. Overall it was put together well, and i think it will appeal to a large audience of people.",1131408000,,378,4.414285714285715
2402742,5,B000B5XPF6,"and seriously check this movie out. Its an impressive psychological thriller that has rarely been done in hollywood. I really enjoyed the acting of the seasoned actors, and the story was never extremely cheesy. Overall the choreography, artwork, and premise were right on key, and i would highly recommend this to anyone who likes horror flicks.",1131321600,,345,5.178571428571429
2402772,5,B000B5XPF6,"to be honest i really didn't think much of this flick when i first heard bout it. But then i saw the trailer and that really did it for me. Its definately a cross between movies like psycho and identity and really keeps you on your toes throughout the whole movie. Even though its a straight to dvd release, i have to give it up to the film-makers for making an awesome movie, with the tight budget they probably had. 5 stars",1131321600,,425,4.195121951219512
2402773,1,B000B5XPF6,"SPOILER ALERT!: The producers tried to hide the bad reviews this film received under its original title ""Unaware"" by changing the name to ""Rockville Slayer"". A rose by any other name would smell as sweet but a stinker is a stinker no matter what you call it. It's direct to video films like this that have become the new last stomping grounds for ex-stars on their way to retirement. Joe Estevez tries his best and he's the only thing ""Rockville Slayer"" has going for it. Robert Z'Dar looks and acts like he didn't care. At times you'll think he was looking around to make sure the paymaster was on the set. Linnea Quigley was a beautiful starlet in classics like ""Return of the Living Dead"" but those salad days are twenty years gone. Some of the newcomers are attractive but they won't want to include this on their future resumes.

And I've learned from experience with this film company, get ready for the family and friends of the cast and crew and director to start piling on with fake reviews to pump up the films rating. Look especially at all the reviews from ""reviewers"" who are only reviewing this one film (before its release date!) or just reviewing this film and ""Bomb The System"" or one other film...quite a coincidence, is it not?  It's a sorry state, really.  But wait, once they read this expose they will try to get it removed and start adding to their fake review catalog.

The story is really about some psycho who goes around skewering the usual set of cardboard characters in a small town that might have some secrets in its history. When the town's only hope rests on the narrow shoulders of a deputy who looks like he was cast as Barney Fife's twin, and whose played by some guy named, I swear, Circus, I knew there was no hope for either the town or for me. You have a whole cast full of nobodies and suddenly b-movie stock actors Robert Z'Dar and Linnea Quigley show up (and show their age) and you immediately know they have to be the bad guys. They get theirs in a simpleton shootout ending and then Barney Fife drives away and leaves town. One of the Fed cops, Nicky Buehrer, is good looking but she needs a few more acting lessons.",1131148800,15,2162,4.465822784810126
2402774,5,B000B5XPF6,"then watch this movie! This is a very suspenseful and creepy film, with very cool plot twists. Nightmares. Yeah, can you believe it!? If you want a good scare and feed off of it like I do, then get this movie. Seriously.",1130457600,,220,4.261904761904762

2402778,5,B000B5XPF6,I love horror movies and Rockville Slayer is devilishly entertaining.

2402779,5,B000B5XPF6,"this movie was GREAT. watch the trailer if you can, because its the reason why i went to see it in the first place.  its hard to see what the story is from the trailer, but it pans out pretty nicely in the movie.  i don't want to ruin it by saying too much, but somehow the director turned the typical storyline into a quality psychological thriller.",1130112000,,350,4.208955223880597

8082160,2,B000B5XPF6,"I am giving this movie 2 stars because Linnea Quigley is in it. I usually look at a film if she is present. I agree with another reviewer, the script is all over the place. It makes little sense. It could have been far better maybe with a re -write. The music and direction didn't bother me, but the direction was slow because of the poor slow moving script. No director could have made a quality production with what they gave them.  I can only recommend it because it is a penny, plus the postage. If the price went to a dollar, I wouldn't buy it.",1405382400,,549,4.179245283018868
8082161,3,B000B5XPF6,"Two HS football stars Steve (Michael Kessler) and Tim (Mike Markoff) are making out with their cheerleader girlfriends Alison (Megan Lynn Stoudt) and Robin (Holly Ilyne Sari). What dates this movie is that the football stars communicate with each other (they are in separate cars) by walkie-talkie. They all get their throat cut. A woman (Amy Brown) who has escaped from the Clearbrooke Mental Hospital is blamed and subsequently killed.

Our investigator (Nicole Buehrer) who looks like Tina Fey, continues the investigation. As it turns out the town has secrets.

The transfer to DVD was not clean. The sound doesn't line up to the lip movement. The acting was substandard especially the touching scene between Charlie (Circus-Szalewski) and his dad (Bob Farster) as dad confesses Charlie's heritage, explaining his bad dreams. The plot is pushed and doesn't have time to develop, but considering the acting, that may be a good thing.

8082162,1,B000B5XPF6,Quite possibly some of the worst acting and writing I have witnessed. The sad thing is that it seemed as if the actors really thought they were being convincing and true to their craft. I haven't seen so many fake cries or unnatural deliveries of lines in my life. Believe me when I tell you that my friends and I made better movies with more believable characters at the age of 14. Also to note I thought it was just my TV but as other reviews noted the sound quality is horrible as the lines came out like whispers through most of the film. I beg you do not buy this movie. Walk away. It's not even in a category of good bad films where you want to see it just so you can comment on the absurdity of it with others. The only plus for me was that I saw a movie with Joe Estevez in it which can not be said by many others. In all fairness he was probably the most believable in his acting minus his death scene.,1316390400,,911,4.010989010989011
8082163,2,B000B5XPF6,"When buying this DVD, I thought it would be good movie to watch even if it wasn't one of the well known horror movies.  Although it was good than most movies of that are out there of this caliber, but my biggest complaint was the sound quality of the movie.  I like to be able to watch a movie without having to put on Closed Caption to know what's being said at points throughout the movie cause of the low volume.  Other than that it was at least a 2.5 out of 5 for me, though it could've been better executed.",1273536000,2,512,4.0495049504950495
8082164,1,B000B5XPF6,"The Rockville Slayer (Marc Selz, 2004)

The reason I'm not sure if Spiker was the worst movie I saw this week is entirely down to The Rockville Slayer. It might have been slightly, and I do mean slightly, better, but every time I thought there was some minor hope that this movie was going to get (relatively) better, the horrendous acting and terrible special effects, as well as the rootlessness of the final thirty minutes of the movie, pulled it right back down into the muck.

The movie opens with the deaths of three high school students and the mutilation of a fourth. Suspicion for the murders falls on a recently escaped mental patient (Amy Brown, from the wonderfully-named Pot Zombies), but the local sheriff's deputy (Circus-Szalewski--yes, that's his name) and an FBI detective (Nicole Buehrer of the upcoming Trippin') aren't buying into the conventional wisdom.

There's a reason very few people in this movie have extensive acting credits (and those who do are known for acting in terrible movies--Joe Estevez, Robert Z'Dar, Linnea Quigley, and in his first film, Richard Strobel all make appearances here); the acting here is uniformly awful. And for ""awful"", read ""it's the worst acting you've seen in any movie with a budget of more than ten thousand dollars."" Even worse is the script, which allows the bad actors to deliver hackneyed lines. Not only that, but the movie feels like it should have actually been about an hour long; the rest of it seems as if it were tacked on when they realized the movie wasn't quite feature-length. It gets dumb (well, dumber) at that point, and never recovers. It's watchable, in a train-wreck sort of way, but you'll hate yourself in the morning. (half)",1255478400,2,1710,4.869415807560137
