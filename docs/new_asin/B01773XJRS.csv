8738211,4,B01773XJRS,"U-Boats Westward had surprisingly little propaganda. Mostly it is just an action story about submariners in action. It has plenty of exciting scenes. Of course there is the ""war is good"" subtext that you find in many German WW2 films, but they don't talk about Nazi policies, which was nice.

Lots of good footage of genuine u-boats at sea, and interior shots as well.",1535414400,,368,4.75
