8681031,5,B00005YAR0,"I as seem to remember this video tape from Rock Steady and Producer Damien Vivona really put the Casablanca Record and FilmWorks experience  on the map. It's filled with all fantastic and high quality unreleased footage and newsreels, right off the masters narrated by Chuck Ashman. I think they are returning with a all new DVD in 2014 Called Return To ""Inside The Casbah"". I did some research on the internet and I came across the site dedicated to the iconic video cassette @ insidethecasbah.com. So anybody that's in need of their Kiss, Donna Summer, Village People and Parliament fix this is the DVD you need to purchase and check out there website. For everything that ""Inside The Casbah"" has to offer. Thanks D'aveli",1380672000,,723,4.830645161290323
