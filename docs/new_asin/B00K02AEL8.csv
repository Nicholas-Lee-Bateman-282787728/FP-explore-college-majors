8654761,5,B00K02AEL8,This was a great documentary into the lives of 1st year cadets.  I like that it showed what Academy life is like for them and their struggles and successes.  As a parent of a son is will be attending the Academy it was good for us to see what he has ahead of him.,1490572800,,263,3.8518518518518516
8654762,4,B00K02AEL8,This video gives insight into the life of a cadet at USAFA and it is highly recommended.  I think they even show it in the Visitor Gift shop as the school.  Great timely transaction!,1436745600,,182,4.323529411764706
8654763,2,B00K02AEL8,"This is not a documentary.  It's a recruiting video for the Academy.  Do not expect a journalistic take of the USAFA, like you saw in the book ""Absolutely American,"" that discusses the Academy's recent issues with sexual assault or religious freedom.

A little boring.  The cadets followed are not particularly well-spoken or dynamic.  No major story lines.  Lots of talking points.",1436400000,,382,5.180327868852459
8654764,5,B00K02AEL8,Good insight,1435276800,,12,5.5
8654765,5,B00K02AEL8,A very intimate and insightful look into the experience of first year (freshman) cadets at the Air Force Academy. This should be required viewing for everyone thinking about applying - know what you are about to sign up for.  If you think you are up to the challenge - GO FOR IT!,1430352000,,279,4.365384615384615
8654766,5,B00K02AEL8,"If you're thinking of attending USAFA, or are appointed and waiting for basic cadet training, you and your family need to watch this video because it offers a great overview of what to expect.  If you want a better appreciation for what cadets go through in USAFA's rigorous program, this video is for you, too.",1428105600,2,311,4.654545454545454
8654767,5,B00K02AEL8,"Absolutely amazing inside view from the point of view of First Year Cadets (Doolies) at the United States Air Force Academy.  It takes the freshman flight of Tiger 10 Squadron from the day they report for basic training through the graduation parade of the Seniors who trained them.  It clearly shows the professional training administered to those fortunate enough to gain entrance to one of our Nation's top two military academies.  Must see for anyone who wants to become a United States Air Force Officer.  Lets you live the stress, the tears, the defeats and the victories of the future leaders of our Nation's air, space and cyber power.  Learn why stress that would really bother the average person is no big deal for Academy graduates and rolls off their backs.  When the final ""fall out and make corrections"" order is given, sense the joy and the pride when the answer is: ""Sir or Ma'am, there are no more corrections to make.:""  Sponsored by the Boeing Aircraft Corporation and the Air Force Academy Association of Graduates (AKA: The AOG Mafia).",1422662400,4,1056,4.833333333333333
