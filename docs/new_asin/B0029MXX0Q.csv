8357989,4,B0029MXX0Q,"A long time ago, in 1971, Sergio Leone co-wrote a screenplay set during the Mexican Revolution, about a bandit who is thrown into the fray of it and emerges a grand and glorious hero. The film was called 'Giu la Testa', and Leone had written the main character, Juan Miranda, with Eli Wallach in mind. Miranda was even modelled off of Leone and Wallach's beloved creation, Tuco Ramirez from 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. Wallach jumped at the chance of playing Juan, but the studios had a different idea. Rod Steiger was on a contract to do one final movie with United Artists, and 'Giu' la Testa' had to be it. This decision ended the friendship between Leone and Wallach.
However, Wallach made up for it by being cast in this movie, 'Viva la muerte... tua!' He reportedly didn't like the title and so came up with 'Don't Turn the Other Cheek!'
He plays Max Lozoya, a likewise Tuco-ish Mexican bandit who has half of a treasure map tattooed on him, but is in jail and about to be hanged. A Russian conman named Dmitri Orlowsky (Franco Nero, who I don't think is even putting on an accent) tries to break Lozoya out of jail, but fails due to his evil cousin so Lozoya ends up saving him instead, not that he likes him or anything.
He pretends that Lozoya is the revolutionary El Salvador, who had been killed prior to the movie's events, but doesn't fool the tough as nails journalist Mary O'Donnell (Lynn Redgrave), who switches between turning the two in and saving them, and hopes to fuel the fire of the revolution to get a story.
I know it's not the best movie out there, but it has grown on me. Wallach and Nero are dynamic together, and Redgrave is a lot of fun to watch as well.
I love the scene where Lozoya visits his sister and nephew and I feel that it brings an extra layer to his character (which Wallach was a natural at anyway).
It's never going to be as good as other Italian period dramas set in America but it's supported by a strong cast.",1494979200,,1962,4.3780821917808215

It is a much better movie when 17 minutes of the original film was added back in for this edition.  Don't buy the 93 minute edition but this 110  minute one.  It makes a lot of difference.  If you like Eli Wallach & Franco Nero, you will enjoy this movie.",1490832000,,379,4.123287671232877

8357993,4,B0029MXX0Q,"DON'T TURN THE OTHER CHEEK (directed by Duccio Tessari) is an entertaining movie that combines elements from Sergio Leone's THE GOOD, BAD AND THE UGLY with Sergio Corbuuci's two Mexican revolution films, A PROFESSIONAL GUN (THE MERCENARY) and COMPANEROS.  Franco Nero plays a character similar to the roles that he played in Corbucci's two films.  Instead of being a Polish or Swedish arms dealer, he's a Russian swindler this time around. While Nero's character was teamed up with a young Mexican revolutionary in Corbucci's films, his partner is now a Mexican bandit played by El Wallach.  The movie borrows from Wallach's classic portrayal in Leone's film by having the two scoundrels betraying each other in a search for gold.  Complicating their quest is a feisty Irish female revolutionary skilled in fisticuffs.  Played with great panache by Lynn Redgrave, this character is the most original in the movie. Horst Janson (best known for CAPTAIN KRONOS, VAMPIRE HUNTER) plays an enemy from the Russian's past.  Janson's role roughly corresponds to the Jack Palance characters from Corbucci's earlier films.  Although this film is considered a comedy, there is considerable murder and mayhem. The movie takes an unexpected serious turn when two very likable characters are murdered by government troops.

Eduaro Fajardo (the villain from Corbucci's DJANGO) plays an evil general named Huerta. There was a real-life General Huerta in the Mexican revolution, but his fate was quite differnt from the brutal demise of Fajardo's character.

A year on a tomstone indicates that the movie is set in 1912.

The DVD presentation is first-rate with wonderful extras including an interview with Wallach about the 4 spaghetti westerns that he made in the course of his distinguished career.",1246060800,12,1783,5.268551236749117
8357994,3,B0029MXX0Q,"I will admit up front that I am not the biggest fan of spaghetti western comedies. I prefer gritty serious ones but I still find some charm a few of the comedy types including Trinity films and Ben and Charlie.

Franco Nero is a Russian Prince who finds out about the name of a Mexican bandit that knows the location of some gold. He finds the Mexican (played by Eli Wallach, famous for The Good the Bad and the Ugly) in prison he holds the information until Nero gets him out of jail. Along for the ride is a red-headed Irish girl who wants fame on taking pictures of the Mexican revolution.

I decided to buy this because of the all-star cast (and for the fact I collect almost anything released by Wild East entertainment). I mean we have Django and Tuco in the same film! The problem with the film however isn't the cast but the fact that it tries to hard to be funny. Other comedy westerns just let it happen where here the dialogue tries too hard to say ""hey, this is funny....laugh!"". Despite the fact that the film lacks many true laughs shouldn't stop people from seeing this film. It is a nice curiosity piece and it's also great to see Franco Nero and Eli Wallach on screen together. It's too bad the film didn't turn out as good as the Franco Nero / Tomas Milian western Companeros which had some great comedy moments.

The Wild East DVD is great as usual. It's in anamorphic widescreen and for the first time in America we get the full UNCUT version of the film. All previous version released in the U.S. were cut down to 93 minutes. This version contains additional 17 minutes. This uncut footage was never dubbed into English so this footage is presented on the DVD in Italian with English subtitles. A great interview with Eli Wallach on the DVD is worth the purchase alone. Also included are two additional title sequences including the International one with the title Long Live Your Death as well as the American animated title sequence which includes a horse shacking it's behind at the screen (!?!?!).",1243641600,13,2022,4.5040871934604905
