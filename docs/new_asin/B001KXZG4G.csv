3674036,1,B001KXZG4G,"...by putting out your hard-earned shekels for this movie, which smells like something bees make, and IT AIN'T HONEY! I love a good ""bee/spider/snake/any kind of dangerous thing on-the-loose"" type of movie, and usually the tackier the production of the film, the more fun it is. The only deadly thing about this movie, is, how boring it is. A group of 6 cute (naturally) Japanese girls decide to go camping out in the wilderness, on a former ski slope. It's not really the wilderness, but it is at least a two hour walk from where you can leave your car. Why they chose this place, of course, fits into the utter helplessness of their eventual situation. Although one of the girls' fathers is with them to chaperone, SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER!, it really doesn't make any difference because....wait for it... everyone dies in this movie, except one. Between the beginning of the film, and the depressing end, we get 90+ minutes of these girls mourning and whining over the death of their friends, one-by-one. We get these stupid bees stinging the girls for no reason I could see, and half the time you don't even see the girls getting stung-just the aftermath. (swollen appendages, etc.).  I believe watching a film about the drying of paint on a wall would be more exciting. Take it from me -  the director managed to find a way to make a potentially scary/suspenseful/exciting ""horror"" film seem as boring as a PBS fund-raising telethon.",1403740800,,1439,4.798387096774194

3674039,2,B001KXZG4G,"A group of girls go camping out in the wilderness, only to be stung to death -one by one- by KILLER BEES! If you, like me, thought that a movie about killer bees couldn't possibly be boring, then you're in for an unpleasant surprise! Most of the film consists of the girls sitting around in their tents, talking! And talking! Finally, after enough stinging death, the survivors decide to make a run for it, and get themselves lost. Shockingly, bees show up! The girls find shelter, but the bees are buzzing outside! So, the girls sit around talking again. WARNING: This movie contains scenes of such hackneyed CGI, that no human could possibly view it without extracting their own brain! I double-dare anyone to watch this baby sober!

3674043,3,B001KXZG4G,This was a Japanese subtitled movie and kind of silly. I though the special effects were sub par and the acting was poor. The title gave away the plot which took too long to unfold. Not recommended.,1372636800,,198,4.378378378378378
3674044,3,B001KXZG4G,"Killer Bees was a mediocre film, but at least it delivers on a few levels.

The film centers around a group of student campers from the Midoriyama Girl Scout Association.  During the film they hike deep into the forest to go on a camping trip held every year.  This particular year Yoriko's father is the chaperone on the trip.  He is the only adult. Although Miwa, another student, is an expirenced camper and has been on the trip with her father in the past.  The hike is long and it takes the girls two hours to reach their destination, a clearing not far from the forest edge.

During the film Yoriko lets Miwa know that she's embarrassed that her father is on the trip. Miwa sympathizes with Yoriko and tells her that she felt the same way at first when her father was the chaperone. The two girls, along with a third camper Junko, begin to connect and end up becoming the main characters in the film.

Meanwhile another camper Akiko, tells the group that she will make them a special tea from a flower that can be found close to their camp site. As Akiko picks the flower she begins to notice that a bee is buzzing around her.  She retreats from the insect, but it follows her and eventually stings her on the face. Akiko makes it back to the camp but her sting begins to swell. Eventually it's clear that she needs medical attention and Yoriko's father and Akiko's sister leave the group to get her to a doctor. The seperation of the group leaves Miwa in charge.

The girls try in vain to enjoy the rest of the trip. But they are eventually attacked by they bees again. In fact it seems the bees are following them.  After two of the girls and a ranger are killed by the bees, Miwa, Yoriko, and Junko try to make a run for it into the forest. The bees continue to chase them however and Miwa confronts them with fire a couple of times.  Miwa has some success, but the bees seem to have the upper hand. Eventually things come to a conclusion, I won't spoil the ending for you.

Well I would really like to give Killer Bees a higher rating than 3 stars. But that would be over reaching quite a bit.  In fact 3 stars may already be a stretch. The Story is bare bones in general and their is really no explanation given for the bees' behavior.  The description on the DVD box talks about a mutant strain of bees, with a deadly venom that seems to want to hunt humans.  But none of that is explained in the film. The only thing in the film that occurs which seems to trigger the bees' swarming is Akiko going into their territory to pick the flowers. Miwa is a good heroine however, and there is some deeper friendship bonding between her, Junko and Yoriko. The plot however, is hurt by a sluggish pace and a lack of a deeper story.  Basically all we see are the girls running away from the bees and some mournful reactions over the deaths inflicted by the bees. The story does seem to indicate that the bees are hunting for humans in general and that they are a higher evoloved form of bee, but that is never stated.  Only implied.

The bees themselves are CGI in most scenes and are sometimes just toy props. They don't appear realistic in several scenes.  Also the bee attacks were not very graphic. Very PG-13. It was not a big problem for me, but it may be to some viewers who demand a stronger sense of realism in the flims they are watching.

As far as the tech aspects, the film is in Japanese only with English subtitles. No English dub.  No other features appear.

In the end I gave the film 3 stars. This was a V-cineam film and was meant to be a direct to video realease in Japan. I think the main draw to this film are the girls themselves. Several of them are cute, although this is in no way a pink film.  I also like that Switchblade Pictures is releasing movies like this on DVD. Killer Bees is a Sci Fi film by nature and might be comparable to made for TV films on the Sci Fi channel.  I'd say this film won't stand up to most people's standards though. It's not really a horror film. The story is too thin to be considered good Sci Fi, and I wouldn't call it a great man against nature film either.  In the end what Killer Bees has going for it is some mediocre acting along with some fairly attractive girls. If that's enough for you, then you may like this film. If not, don't bother with it. You will likely be disappointed.",1278288000,4,4350,4.263990267639903

I can deal with subs, not a big deal, but the acting and the premise of killer 'bees' aka wasps in the movie, was just really cheesy. Bad acting, the movie has that fluid soap opera effect, and I can't even picture a big budget making this into a higher rating. Maybe 2 for giggles?

Actual Review: This movie is actually about Camping, not Campus'. The first scenes are all the girls piled into a car about to go camping for the Girl Scouts (or some form of girl scouts). The subtitles go super fast here, but NOTHING is important during the car ride, nothing, it's virtually establishing that they are going camping, and establishing that one girl eats a lot (she doesn't).
It's a decent movie, it had some good acting and great locations to film at. I'd like to call it an insect attack film, but it wasn't, it was mostly people yelling and sometimes an insect showing up.
If you like insect related horror films this one is a bit more comedic, not because it's trying to be, but because sometimes the soundtrack is so bad and just doesn't work with the scene at all!.
I did enjoy it, it was very watchable and it had some good scenes and nice characters, but it wasn't a good movie, with the lack of a reason behind certain things, that it failed a bit.",1458172800,,1173,4.3561643835616435
