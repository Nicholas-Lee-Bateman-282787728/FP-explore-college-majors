4217004,5,B003XKQ61G,"I love this combo set it has 5 fireplaces such as classic, beach, modern, castle, and christmas holiday. The audio on the holiday fireplace is ok it plays christmas songs using the xylophone but don't bother listening to the audio for any of the other fireplaces it isn't that good. The video is excellent especially on blu ray it fooled me into thinking I had a real fireplace and it is soooooooo relaxing. The sound is also crystal clear with all the pops and crackles of a real fireplace. If you want some ambience for the holidays or when ever its cold get this combo set. The blu ray version looks more clearer than the dvd and each fireplace loops seamlessly. I'm keeping the bluray and giving the dvd to a friend for the holidays. This disk is the same as hd moods: fire except this one comes with a dvd and its a bit cheaper. If you are worried about picture qualty  don't be, this is the best blu ray ive seen in a while so crisp and sharp.",1291852800,14,949,4.272222222222222
4217005,5,B003XKQ61G,Next best thing to having a real fireplace. It is very pleasant to have on a 50' led TV in blue ray. Very pleasant audio make you think you are sitting near a real fire. Only thing missing is the actual heat. Continuous loop and no annoying water marks from the publisher on the screen. Various fireplace scenes with music or sounds of flame if you prefer.,1420848000,,356,4.3283582089552235
4217006,5,B003XKQ61G,"This ROCKS!  You not only get different Fireplaces, but you also get a CASTLE Fireplace (with scarey music option) for Halloween, and you also get a HOLIDAY Fireplace (with Christmas music if desired).  This is one of the BEST home-DVDs we have purchased...and we just purchased it for Family as Christmas presents.",1419811200,,315,5.038461538461538
4217007,4,B003XKQ61G,"My family has really enjoyed this. The fire looks almost too real on of our tv. I've even found myself stepping closer to it to get some warmth before I remember it's just a tv! This is a really great product, the only down side is that after it runs for about 15 minutes the crackling sound will stop for about 6 minutes. I don't know if it's supposed to do this or not, but it's kind of a bummer. However, that's the only down side I could find. This is definitely worth buying, especially for the price.",1419292800,,506,4.173469387755102
4217008,5,B003XKQ61G,"Very nice, particularly if you compare it to others of the same sort.",1407024000,,69,4.384615384615385
4217009,5,B003XKQ61G,"It's fun for a cold night when you don't have a real fireplace but do have a 70"" LED TV.  Like the sounds too.  Can pick music for crackling fire sounds.",1406937600,,153,3.903225806451613

4217011,5,B003XKQ61G,"Perfect for winter's in Florida when you want the ambiance of a fireplace, but don't have one. Very realistic and looks great on my HD TV.",1397088000,,138,4.346153846153846

4217015,4,B003XKQ61G,"It's a DVD of real logs burning in a fireplace. So it looks realistic and also has some crackling fire noises to accompany the video, though the audio leaves something to be desired (it's inconsistent). Overall, it's an entertaining screen saver on my 50"" TV.",1386979200,,259,4.777777777777778
4217016,4,B003XKQ61G,"I always wanted a fire place but never happened to have one. However when I use this on my 51"" HD TV it provides a real cozy feel of the fire place without a hassle of necessary cleaning, wood or gas expenditure and fire alarm going off occasionally .
One of the best purchases I ever had!:)
I always use the natural sound on it",1374624000,2,328,4.061538461538461

4217021,5,B003XKQ61G,"Ordered this just on impulse one cold, gray, rainy night sitting in our Tacoma kitchen. It is a really fun video to pop in and use as a visible, soft musical background when we're cooking, eating, and entertaining - or just to keep our parrot company when we're gone. A lot of cool variations (I especially like the Christmas and Halloween versions!). Really adds a fun element to the rainy season! Couldn't be happier with an impulse purchase.",1361923200,2,444,4.705128205128205
4217022,5,B003XKQ61G,"We use this on our big flat screen in the living room, on nights when we want to relax, and it's such a great way to relax! No mess of a real fireplace, just pop in the DVD and snooze away.",1359676800,,189,3.6341463414634148
4217023,4,B003XKQ61G,This was purchased on a whim. My review receved four stars because of the music (it can be turned off). There are multiple fireplaces to choose from but the traditional is our favorite. If you have a decent sound system hooked up the crackling of the fire is very realistic. After a new snowfall with everything coated in white we put this in the BluRay player and the effect is almost perfect. Good fun on a cold and stormy night.,1357603200,2,431,4.4
4217024,4,B003XKQ61G,"Still searching for that perfect digital fire.  This one was nice - but we're beginning to think that the problem is with the medium.  What we want is to have:

- the ideal fire visual
- The option to hear the fire itself (and to set the volume of the fire sounds)
- The option to hear music either provided or of our choice (and to be able to set its volume separate from teh fire sound effects volume)

Alas, because this is technically a ""movie"", the mix is fixed.  Yes, we can hear the effects alone, or we can hear music.  In some of the fireplaces in this set (there are multiple), you can also hear a blend of the music and effects.  BUT...

Our gripes include:
1.) Not all fireplaces offer a blend of effects and music  (and why not?  this one really does seem silly)
2.) We can't lower the sound of the music and increase the sound of the fire

But, to be fair, for the second item above, all of the DVD/Blu-Ray fireplace solutions have this same restriction: no ability to set volume on individual tracks.  But, item #1 above should not have been - no reason I can think of why all of the fireplaces do not offer a blend of music and sound effects.",1357171200,4,1158,4.1900452488687785
4217025,4,B003XKQ61G,"Since there is no fireplace in my home, I thought I'd purchase one on Blu-ray. I'm glad I did. Amazon had a great price for this Blu-ray / DVD Combo pack just in time for the holidays. I played the Christmas-themed fireplace throughout December while wrapping gifts and reading to create a cozy atmosphere. Here's a breakdown of the Pros and Cons:

Pros:
Great picture quality from the Blu-ray on my 50"" plasma
The amount of crackling logs was just right for the holiday themed fireplace's soundtrack
4 different fireplace options: Traditional, Beach, Holiday and Castle - you can have a fireplace to go with the seasons and holidays.
Different soundtrack options for each fireplace: Logs crackling + 3 ambient music options
Combo-pack lets you keep the Blu-ray and give the DVD to a friend - a great value

Cons (it's a very minor one):
The holiday themed fireplace isn't a continuous view, at some point it changes to a closer shot of the fireplace. Not really a big deal, though.",1356825600,5,982,4.7368421052631575
4217026,5,B003XKQ61G,I always look for the best scenery Blu-Ray disks but am mostly dispappointed. However this one is really good. There are several different videos to choose and different sounds also.,1356825600,2,182,5.1

4217029,5,B003XKQ61G,I LOVE THIS DVD! VERY RELAXING! KEPT THE BLUE-RAY DVD FOR MY SELF. GAVE REGULAR DVD TO MY IN-LAWS. THEY LOVE IT TO! I LIKE THE DIFFERENT SCENE SETTINGS.,1319587200,4,152,4.275862068965517
4217030,3,B003XKQ61G,"The quality is good, the sound effect as well. However; the size of the log set up that resembles the fire is too small and takes only a small portion of the screen. It would be more realistic if it would take most of the screen.

4217031,5,B003XKQ61G,"I've enjoyed this DVD a good bit since I got it.  I like to read curled up on the sofa on cold winter nights, and this is just the right touch.  The different scenes keep you from getting bored and the music is relaxing.  Perfect for people who don't have a fireplace but like the coziness of a fire.",1295913600,6,300,4.0508474576271185
4217032,5,B003XKQ61G,"Last year we suffered through a pitiful fireplace DVD.  This year it was a pleasure to keep this blu ray on!  It was the perfect complement to the room while we opened Christmas presents and had company over.  The audio options are ""okay"" but we left it on the natural crackling sound, or muted it while Christmas songs were on.  Our favorite Christmas scene was the one with a mantle and hanging stockings!  But for the rest of winter there is a beautiful fire scene without the holiday frills.  The beach one is pretty plain...nothing wrong with that but not very exciting either since you can barely tell it's a beach.  Would have been nice to show some ripples of the ocean behind it maybe...and the last one...is cute...in a gothic sort of way. I can't picture myself using that one unless I had a theme party involving a castle or dungeon.  Hey, everyone's home has a different style and that might be just what you're looking for!  And the picture quality...wow.  I'm really glad I got this shipped just in time for the holidays.",1294185600,10,1036,4.551351351351351
4217033,5,B003XKQ61G,"And on a plasma TV it gets almost as warm...well, of course it doesn't, but the menu system is slick and easy to navigate the scenes and soundtracks. I love these Bluray/DVD combo packs because I can play the video on more than one TV and on ANY player we own. The ""holiday"" one is sort of silly looking as it's the one that's least able to make your TV look like a fireplace. Not sure why the gas fireplace crackles like a wood fire. Beware on plasma TV's the image will retain so be sure to run your brightness low or enable the anti-image retention tools. I have a TCP50G20 THX Panasonic with the fast phosphors so I was a bit disappointed that after 10 minutes of viewing I could clearly see where the fire had been...using the TV's scrolling white bar got rid of it though. Also, haven't watched all of them yet, but Castle and Beach both change angles as to move the flames on the TV to reduce the chance of true burn-in. This company did their homework on this edition and the kids love it! I think we'll probably take a look at buying some of the others as passive entertainment--adds ambiance to the room when we read stories or play boardgames. And in case you have any doubts, this is the one you want for widescreen, 1080p TV's...the image is perfect. The music isn't for everyone however...the coyotes and creaking floor in Castle are too much while the crackling 5.1 is great.",1292889600,6,1390,4.391472868217054
4217034,4,B003XKQ61G,"The disc includes five fireplaces, each running about 10-15 minutes with a minor angle change halfway through. Image is very clear. The fireplace segment called ""Beach"" is a bit of a disappointment because it was shot at night with no backlighting, so there is nothing to indicate a beach -- no sand or surf -- and could just as easily have been called ""Warehouse fire."" The segment titled ""Modern"" is of a gas fireplace, and it's actually quite effective as it is  shot in closeup and fills the 16x9 dimensions of the wide-screen image.

There are multiple audio options for each fireplace, but I recommend sticking with ""natural,"" which is a recording of a popping, crackling fireplace. However, it does not appear to be live sync-sound recorded during the filming because none of the pops or crackles match the image. The other audio options are cheesy new-age synth tracks. The ""Holiday"" fireplace looks great, but it's audio option of Christmas standards is played, again, with a bell setting on a synthesizer or comparable digital device.

Again, the fireplaces themselves look nice in Blu ray, but the audio options are nothing special.",1291939200,25,1143,4.973821989528796

There's music and loud talking going on in the room anyway so the soundtrack of the DVD is irrelevant to me.  Just adds a really nice ambiance to a holiday party to have this going in the corner of the room on the 46"" tv- plays on a loop so I never have to tend to it until all the guests have gone home.",1440547200,,398,3.783132530120482

8408217,5,B003XKQ61G,"I know, a fireplace on a TV...but it's AWESOME. We entertained guests for a Christmas Eve dinner and I popped this on and everyone loved it! The fact that there is an array of different fireplaces and themes makes it all the better. Totally worth it. The only thing I would recommend is if you use the spooky/Halloween themed one is that you play your own music. The crackling fireplace sound effects are great but don't expect high end licensed music which fine. Odds are if you own an HD TV and are putting a fireplace on it, you have some form of radio or MP3 player to play good music.",1428796800,,589,4.315315315315315

It is perfect. This package comes with 2 dvd's. One is Bluray. I was able to put one on in living room the other in our bedroom during the holiday and winter. I liked it so much, I haven't tried the orher setting like the beach fire or others. I highly recommend this product.",1423008000,,449,4.113636363636363
