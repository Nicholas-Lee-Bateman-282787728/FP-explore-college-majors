6508123,4,B00LVZJW4I,One of my guilty pleasure movies. Michael Parks stole the movie for me. Just sorry he wasn't in the whole film. The mans a treasure.,1420329600,2,132,4.32
6508124,1,B00LVZJW4I,Sace your money and just buy the dvd. Very shameful.,1413849600,4,52,4.3
6508145,3,B00LVZJW4I,Movie gets 5 stars. This Blu-ray gets 1 Star cause THERE IS NO CLOSED CAPTIONING. What the hell?,1516579200,,96,4.388888888888889
6508146,5,B00LVZJW4I,A great movie,1514505600,,13,3.6666666666666665
6508147,5,B00LVZJW4I,"Quality B rated movie here. Very ""Tarantino"", so if you are a fan, you must buy this. Robert Rodriguez directed this, so again, this is going to be a wildly different take on a vampire movie. Clooney is impressive. Plus Salma Hayek dancing around in a bikini helps. Came with a digital code/ultraviolent and it worked. Worth a buy if is cheap, which it usually is.",1513555200,2,364,4.53030303030303
6508148,2,B00LVZJW4I,"Blu-ray has main menu and chapter menu. (Background image on main menu reveals plot twist, if you care) There are no subtitles. Single DTS audio stream is adequate, although low on volume, making some dialog difficult to understand. Video transfer is nothing to brag about. An all-around bargain-basement release. I actually like my DVD better. See highdefdigest for the full story.",1510185600,2,382,5.278688524590164
6508149,5,B00LVZJW4I,Love this movie,1507766400,,15,4.333333333333333
6508150,4,B00LVZJW4I,"If you haven't already seen this movie, wtf? See it already. If you have seen it, then you already know that it's good enough to own on Blu Ray. You don't need me to tell you that. Have a good day.",1505520000,,197,3.8292682926829267
6508151,4,B00LVZJW4I,Stupid movie but it was fun to watch. The masks the actors wear look like they came out out of a second rate Halloween Costume Shop.,1497398400,,132,4.115384615384615
6508152,4,B00LVZJW4I,Hayek yeah and Tito and the Tarantulas ain't bad either.,1493942400,,56,4.7

6508155,5,B00LVZJW4I,"Released in late 1996 and directed by Robert Rodriguez from Quentin Tarantinos script, From Dusk Till Dawn is a crime thriller/horror film starring George Clooney and Tarantino as two violent thugs in Texas who take hostage a disillusioned ex-minister (Harvey Keitel) and his son & daughter (Ernest Liu & Juliette Lewis). Hiding in their RV, they escape into Mexico where they stop at a desert strip joint in order to rendezvous with their contact in the morning (Cheech Marin). Unexpectedly, the bar preys upon its patrons.

Mixing ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) with ""The Lost Boys"" (1987) and ""The Evil Dead"" (1981), ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" pulsates with hip energy and flair. Clooney shines in his first feature film as the antagonist-turned-protagonist. Salma Hayek's dance routine is jaw-dropping and iconic. The movie blends weighty spirituality with extreme irreverence, violence, gore and comic booky evil for a highly entertaining flick. Its not scary at all; but its fun and thrilling, with thoughtful dialog.

ADDITIONAL CAST: Tom Savini, Fred Williamson, Danny Trejo, Michael Parks, John Saxon and Kelly Preston.

The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in Barstow, Lancaster and Los Angeles, California; Chihuahua, Mexico; Redmond and Seattle, Washington.

6508157,5,B00LVZJW4I,"It's Twilight for men! This film has the 3 b's blood, boobs and bad language.",1487203200,,77,4.2
6508158,3,B00LVZJW4I,"This is not strictly a Tarantino film - it is a collaboration with his good pal Robert Rodriguez.  Clooney is passable but his character could have been played by any nobody. It was one of the first movies - for that time - with a twist, both horror & action and I'd have paid the price of a ticket just to watch the Salma Hayek dance scene - mesmerizing. If you like the vampire genre this should be in your collection",1485129600,,419,4.172839506172839
6508159,5,B00LVZJW4I,A hoot. Black humor at its best. Salma's dance makes it worth the price.,1481155200,,72,4.214285714285714

6508193,5,B00LVZJW4I,"Hadn't see it for about 10 years, saw the cheap price on the Blue-ray and went for it.  Still enjoyed it, great fun if you like the genre.  Looked very good in blue-ray though not sure it  especially benefits vs. sd since I can't compare.  I may try the TV series sometime just wish Joss Weadon had done it ;) .",1444435200,,311,4.049180327868853
6508194,1,B00LVZJW4I,"I have seen this movie before and liked it but this Blu-ray copy does not have subtitles or special features
so it is less than a rental disk. The sound track is bad so that about half the dialogue is unintelligible
so it is actually worthless without subtitles to read what is being said. I feel like the victim
of fraud rather than a satisfied owner.",1444435200,7,352,4.348484848484849
6508195,5,B00LVZJW4I,"Salma Hayek is one of the most beautiful women in the world. Clearly the best striptease performance in a movie, ever!

Oh and the movie was awesome too. Lots of blood, action, green stuff and an excellent cast!",1444262400,,211,4.552631578947368

6508200,5,B00LVZJW4I,"All my life, I've heard this movie's name and about Salma Hayek's dance scene with the snake, nothing more. I knew I had to see it and it would be definitely more than once. October 31st was the date I first saw this movie and I went in basically blind. I had no idea aside from the aforementioned what was going to happen in this movie...
My jaw dropped. And I couldn't stop thinking about ""why the hell doesn't this movie get the respect it deserves?!"". It is BADASS. Fantastic actors picked for the perfect roles, crazy plot twists, sucker-punch action scenes, authentic set design, music choice, and the best exotic dancing scene of all time... Oh wow.
People like Tarantino and Rodriguez never cease to amaze my senses. I won't spoil anything... Once you watch this movie, you will own it. No! It will own you. Forever.",1426377600,10,824,4.574324324324325

Classic!",1531267200,,33,5.8
8668366,5,B00LVZJW4I,"If you want a bloody, cheesy, Quentin Tarantino movie with lots of gratuitous nudity then this is for you.  I always saw this movie as a goofy thing to watch in the right mood and this was a great cheap way to get it on digital.

This won't win any awards for best of anything except for best weapons.  Sex Machines crotch pistol (that they used in other unrelated movies), and the pump action crossbow are two notable favorites.

If you've got time to kill and want to see some very fake blood and violence then this is your movie.",1529884800,,532,4.29

8668371,5,B00LVZJW4I,"I'm not rating the movie, because we all know it's great. What I'm rating is my purchase of this Blu Ray. I had the movie on DVD, but when I went to play it on my blu-ray player it just looked old and grainy. I was ""blown away"" by both the picture and sound of the blu-ray version. Thanks for a great version of a great movie.",1520899200,,326,3.8805970149253732
