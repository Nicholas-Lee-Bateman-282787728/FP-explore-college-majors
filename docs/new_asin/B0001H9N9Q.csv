8012776,5,B0001H9N9Q,"Every year, the Academy Awards manage to overlook a deserving thespian or too. The hardest working man in show business has never received the accolades he deserves. Of course, I am speaking of Frank Stallone. And not only is this movie his greatest achievement, it is the without a doubt the greatest film of all time. Frank Stallone takes the role of Hack Stone to new heights, displaying a range of emotions not seen until The Rock broke through the cinema wall.
Frank Stallone does not play the part, he IS the part! I was totally convinced that he has had special forces training. You can tell by the fact that he only takes one magazine of ammunition with him, carries no protective armor, no communications gear, and has no coordination whatsoever with the law enforcement people outside, that this man has studied hostage situations. By landing his helicopter directly in front of the building of the terrorists, and not taking any cover or concealment, he manages to throw them off balance. Not only that, but by carrying length of blue rope for no particular reason, Hack manages to play head games with the bad guys. When they see that spool of blue rope, they are so intrigued, that can not logically process what to do. Will he tie us up with the rope? Will he swing down from the ceiling on the rope? Maybe he will lasso some stray cattle. By doing absolutely nothing with the rope, those rascally terrorists are terrified, waiting for the moment when the other shoe drops, and he unravels that rope. The anticipation of the rope is enough to keep anyone on pins and needles.

The supporting cast also deserves some recognition, from police official (Capt. Stills) just days away from retiring, to news reporter with the nasal voice (Tony Motta). I only wish that Capt Stills would have taken the last few days off, because I believe that it is not fair for a man who has faithfully served the citizens of Beverly Hills to lose his pension because of what some terrorists have done. Maybe the Police Union could help him. I digress.

And lets not forget those special effects. I was really convinced that they blew up that car as a diversion. And when those Secret Service agents were killed, let me tell you, I had nightmares for days because it was so realistic. George Lucas can learn a few things from these special effects guys. The chase scene rivaled anything from Bullet or French Connection. They way they kept driving around the same building, no wonder they were able to escape. Perhaps if the Beverly Hills Police Department was able to afford a car a little more reliable than an early 1970's Dodge, then they could have rescued the President's daughter. But then, we wouldn't have a movie then, would we?

Overall, a great movie. A realistic plot, slam bang effects, and the greatest man ever to grace the screen.",1523145600,,2841,4.678
8012777,4,B0001H9N9Q,Worth a watch.  Plenty of 80's era big haired ladies and of course the impatient potty mouthed police captain.  I'm not sure why the hero had a climbing rope but no tactical vest for magazines.  In the 80's they didn't worry about such things like realism.  Why was William Smiths voice dubbed?  The ending was a bit anti-climatic.,1519776000,2,331,4.637931034482759

8012779,1,B0001H9N9Q,"Terrible, just sheer terrible. The guy (who the heck was this actor) tries so hard to look like Sylvester Stallone that by the middle of the movie (cut scenes) he has to o to a shrink to really know who he is. The most pathetic thing is that he is the best actor of this pathetic cast.

The sound is a mess with pops, scratches and issues throughout the whole movie. If you're going to go through the effort of putting this on a DVD, make sure you can hear dialogue before selling the thing! Huge disappointment as I was hoping by getting a proper release would make this be at least a VHS quality experience.",1485734400,,495,4.221052631578948
8012781,4,B0001H9N9Q,"Oh, it met my expectations alright. It was everything I thought it would be. The DVD disc was fine, no scratches or anything and it played perfectly fine.  It was delivered a little sooner than I thought. So as far as Amazon is concerned, they did their job perfectly fine.  Now as far as a review of the film itself, I don't really want to get into it. I'm sure there are plenty of other people out there that can tell you all about it. My only advice is to turn DOWN the volume on your speakers because this movie volume is cranked up a little bit too much. Otherwise, enjoy!",1429747200,2,577,4.1891891891891895

Frank Stallone takes the role of Hack Stone to new heights, displaying a range of emotions not seen until The Rock broke through the cinema wall.

Mr Stallone plays a former Special Forces soldier trying to cope in a complex world not of his choosing. Through a series of catastrophes of world importance, he is thrust in the middle of a battle between good and evil. In order to leverage the release of Middle Eastern terrorists, a band of insurgents capture the President's daughter while shopping in Beverly Hills. Well, terror indeed raises it's ugly head, not only in Beverly Hills, but in a particular industrial park somewhere in the outskirts of LA.

The President faces the largest crisis of his administration. Does he submit to the terrorists demands to release their comrades (being held by Isreal, not the US, but that isn't important right now)? Or does he stare down the terrorists by refusing to negotiate, thereby sacrificing his daughter? He goes with plan C, neither of the above. Plan C? Deploy Hack Stone to infiltrate the terrorists lair and rescue the Presidents daughter.

Frank Stallone does not play the part, he is the part! I was totally convinced that he has had special forces training. You can tell by the fact that he only takes one magazine of ammunition with him, carries no protective armor, no communications gear, and has no coordination whatsoever with the law enforcement people outside, that this man has studied hostage situations.

8012784,5,B0001H9N9Q,Terror in Beverly Hills was really a fun movie! It's old but charming. The intrigue and action is great!!,1245283200,5,105,4.578947368421052
8012785,2,B0001H9N9Q,"When your brother is Sly Stallone, how do you end up in garbage like this????  Saw this one on the late, late, late show while flipping the channels and only caught the tail-end.  Only I couldn't find it on video, now after watching it I can see why!!!  Frank Stallone isn't a bad actor in stuff that I seen him in before, Cameron Mitchell has done a lot of good low and high end movies and he and Frank do their best to save this movie!  I couldn't figure out if Frank was a secret agent or cop and that's the big problem with this low budget film, it tries to cram way too much stuff into the plotline then it had for a budget.  ""Terror in Beverly Hills"" gives the city a bad name!!!",1193788800,,685,4.044444444444444
