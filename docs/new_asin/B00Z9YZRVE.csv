7272351,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"""Return of the King"" is just the most phenomoninal film i have EVER seen. And believe it or not, this film will and DOES appeal to everyone.
For fantasy buffs it provides beautifully crafted worlds and epic battle seqences and the best visual effects since ... um well EVER!
And for non-fantasy buffs, take my word for it, before ""Lord of the Rings"" I absolutely REPPELLED against fantasy. No more! Tolkeins composition is so ingenius, it weaves in feelings and life lessons that beings, mythical or truth, should feel and understand. Such as love, trust, understanding, courage, strength, heartbreak, letting go, sacrafice, loyalty, if you wish for me to continue I would, but i know you get the jist.  Soon middle earth and its inhabitants become so real and attached to you, its as if you really belong to the ""Third Age.""
So whether you've been reading it for 50 years, or meerly HEARD of ""the Lord of the Rings"", mark my words ""The Retutn of the King"" will change you forever. You'll experinence enthralling battle scenes (for those who enjoy a bit - or alot - of manslaughter), you'll feel heart-wrenching emotion (for those who tend to fall apart at a tragic scene), it has upbeat humour here and there (for those who like a little joke) and ofcourse it has beautiful music and quenching cinematography (which SHOULD have been nominated for the oscar)
The acting is amazing! absolutely amazing! if you watch the UMPTEEN interviews with the actors, these people don't just act the character, they BECOME the character. These fictional endeveours became their real-life hurdles, and their tears came honestly at the break of every scene. Acting was sensational from everyone, but I was particuarly enthralled by Elijah Wood (Frodo) and Sean Astin's (Sam) performances, for they were truly the essence of the film. The whole point of the film is the small hope that the smallest creatures of all can overcome the most cruelest evil, and this is how all of Peter Jackson's incredible efforts wrap up and tie in a perfectly tied knot.
The ending will leave you both happy, yet totally heartbroken. People do argue that Jackson made too many endings. I say no! He is merely (and brilliantly) pulling together those small, but lose strings that were seen from the ""Fellowship"" through ""The Two Towers"" and into the third. I believe it also emphasised both Jackson's and Frodo's unwill but fate to let go of their pasts, for all things must come to an end to become memory.
Other ""purists"" as they call them, fume that the movie misses certain parts of the tale. But as annoying as this may seem, you must understand that Jackson made an effort to include as much detail as his heart would spare - for he too, and all the cast and crew were also inpecably close to the books. Yes, it neglects certain areas, but its times like those that you much look beyond the chapters and really capture it on screen - after all, you DO have three-and-a-half hours of it! HAHA!
""The Return of the King"" is a magnificently crafted film which will turn any non-believer into a... well... BELIEVER! music - enchanting. Cinematography - superb. Acting - sensational. Emotion - spine-snapping. Visual effects - so brilliant you barely notice! Endings (all 6) - the BEST.
Winner of 11 academy awards, and of millions of hearts around the world, ""The Return of the King"" will turn anyone into a hobbit. A timeless journey. An unbelievable achievement. Simply the BEST of the BEST!",1078444800,5,3459,4.7842809364548495
7272352,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I just read the review of the fellow who said he just realized that this is all one movie...  Absolutely right.  Truly the greatest novel and the greatest movie of all time.
Yeah.  I'm a fantasy geek.  Get over it.
My wife truly loved Return of the King after just sort of liking the first two movies.  She cried a few times.  Hell, how could you not?
If you don't like fantasy or epics you will not like this movie.  Then again, I don't go and see sappy romances because I know I will not enjoy them.  But if you have an open mind and want to be entertained, this is certainly a great movie even beyond my prejudices in its favor.
Now I'm waiting for them to go back and do the Hobbit...",1078358400,2,688,4.082089552238806
7272353,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" is a fitting conclusion to the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  Directed by Peter Jackson, the story continues the saga of war and heroic quest set in a fantasy world populated by humans, elves, and other species.  Although this is a tale told on an epic scale, it is also rich in intimate character moments and drama.
""Return"" is full of huge battle scenes, amazing fantasy creatures, and breathtaking vistas.  Jackson delivers scenes that are full of visual detail.  Every creative aspect of the film--musical score, costumes, sets, etc.--is meticulously crafted and ultimately melds together as part of a compelling total vision.
The large ensemble cast delivers outstanding performances; director Jackson wisely does not allow the amazing special effects and art direction to overwhelm the fine acting.  The film also maintains an effective balance of multiple story lines.  Although set in a fantasy world, ""Return"" is about themes and values that are relevant in our ""real"" world--loyalty, leadership, courage, and hope.  And in the end it's the moral and emotional vision of the film that really made an impact on me.  With this film, Jackson completes what is truly one of the great trilogies in all of cinematic history.",1078358400,2,1274,5.062200956937799
7272354,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"There has never been, and may never be again, any film, let alone three, to rival The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
Just as everyone in New Zealand must have been thanked at the Academy Awards, so everything possible must have been said about Peter Jackson's work of genius in bringing the cast, crew, effects and all other aspects of the filmmaking process together in total harmony. But I will still add my mite, and say that these three movies are no less than awe-inspiring, and as much for the incredible tale of their making as revealed on the extended DVDs (thank you, thank you, thank you!!) as for the experience of seeing them in the theaters.
Mr. Jackson deserves a special Oscar for bringing these three films to life in an incredibly short time (considering the almost obsessive attention to detail) and in a budget that seemed massive to the studio but in reality was very modest considering the scope of the venture, and no amount of monetary rewards for all concerned could be too great.
A new standard has been set for the art of filmmaking. I hope I see even one more such grand adventure on screen in my lifetime. But I won't hold my breath.
Peter Jackson is truly the Lord of the Rings - and he's certainly much more humble than any previous holder of that title! Long may he reign!
Tialin",1078272000,3,1306,4.514767932489452
7272355,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"If I were called to describe the three chapters of the Lord of the Ring Trilogy in one word, I would probably call The Fellowship of the Ring Serine with it's peaceful shots of the Shire, elf villages, and forests. The Two Towers, I'd call Hectic, with our heroes dashing to and fro trying to accomplish
multiple tasks. As for The Return of the King, that one word that explains it perfectly is: Chaos.
  If asked to explain the plot, I'd simply reply Chaos, pure Chaos, with Aragon, Gimli, and Legolas, along with the Wizard Gandalf preparing, then engaging in multiple battles, with multiple armies, some of whom, aren't even of this earth. Chaos explains the journey of Frodo Baggins, and Sam Gamgee as they seem simply to craw along mountain tops in agony, desperately trying to reach their destination, as every second seems like an eternity. Or as they try to deduce the true motives of the multiple personality impaired Gollum, who makes their journey all the more daunting.
  Chaos explains the cinematography of the film. In the first film, most shots contained the green hue of tree leafs and grass. In the second chapter, the hue was now gray with rock. Now that hue has changed to the blood red of fire and lava. The amazing landscape shots look as though they should be plastered on the ceiling of a Roman Church. That's how good the camera work is in this film. The cinematographer has seemed to transcend film from being merely a bland, uneventful window into a story world, to being an actual art form.
  Chaos explains the attitudes of all the characters, whom through the film seem as though they've been beaten to a bloody pulp, both physically, and mentally. Not to sound mocking, but in every scene in which he is present, Frodo seems as though he is half dead, every word spoken seems painful, every movement seems agonizing. Likewise for Sam, who's always-look-on-the-bright-side attitude is battered throughout the film. The rest of the cast's demeanors are all taunt and intense, obviously because through the course of the movie, they fight at least three major battles.
  And as for the battles, guess what. Chaos also explains them as well. Giant elephants, ghost armies, dragon-like birds, and giant (equipped human intelligence) eagles, not to mention the hob-goblin-like Orcs, all are involved in skirmishes in this movie. All these grandiose spectacles add to all of the battle scenes making them even more (guess what!) chaotic then one would think possible. What more could you possibly want?
  Something I like to ignore in reviews I simply must mention in this one: special effects. As I said, I really don't like to talk about SF because they are used just too much these day, and usually, are not important at all in the movie. But, and this is a big but, this film proves my two beliefs wrong, with a character like Gollum, the SF does become a storyline, and with hard-to-tell effects and blending, ROTK doesn't become over-reliant on effects, making the movie's SF extremely enjoyable.
  The musical score is good to, having several strong and enjoyable main themes, that are delivered at opportune times in the film. Though, as my one criticism of the film, I have to wonder if the score would have been better if, say, John Williams was drafted to do the score instead of Howard Shore...
  But really the best thing about this film, is how all the necessary sections come to together perfectly: acting, story, cinematography, special effects, musical score, and just overall heart and sincerity, make what this movie is; one of the best ever made...
Oh, and just in case you were wondering; yes, The Return of the King does deserve every single one of those eleven Oscars. It should have been twelve even; Why it wasn't nominated for Cinematography, I'll never know.",1078099200,6,3809,4.8131699846860645
7272356,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The Return of the King won Best Picture, and Best Director Peter Jackson.  Effectively ending the accademies (no science fiction or fantasy film shall receive an oscar rule).  You must see this film, I haven't had this much joy watching a movie since I was a young boy and saw Return of the Jedi.  The Films clearly show their debts to the works of tolkien, and steven spielberg and george lucas.  Most people at weta Digital either had been big fans of the original star wars trilogy, or had worked at Industrial Light and Magic.  One of the pruducers at weta digital worked on the special editions.  Steven Speilberg presented the award to Peter Jackson, and most people don't know that both he and his friend george lucas were fans of the books.
The best thing about the film trilogy though is that it could get people to read the books, and it opened (good or bad) new doors for Tolkien Scholarship.",1078012800,4,903,4.54320987654321
7272357,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"What is the true meaning of Frodo's errand? No less than the redemption of humankind.  Indeed, we do live in what is almost the day of the Orc.  Is our world today that much less a hell than the burning plains of Mordor where the all-seeing eye of Sauron ever torments?
Inevitably, the overwhelming threat of doom (which we in fear, and greed, and obsessive heartlessness of a Gollum or any other maker of Evil have created) will have to be faced.  Probably, in this generation or the next, the climactic battle will occur.
For this reason, if not for many others, this film demands to be seen.  Do you share enough in the vision of peace, the humility of the Shire, the courage of Aragon, to allign with the forces of Good?  For not the armies of the dead shall claim this victory, but those of the living.
For over four decades people attempted to covert Tolkien's masterpiece into the great cinema which we all knew it could be.  Peter Jackson et al have done a commendable job with very challenging material and the usual monetary and temporal contraints.",1077840000,6,1059,4.5473684210526315
7272358,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"I initially vowed not to watch this movie. The second had me so offended by everything that Peter Jackson had embellished, and truth to tell, I nearly walked out on the Fellowship of the Ring during the Rivendell sequence. The reason for this is I could give an hour long synopsis of the history and story of Middle-Earth ten years after I was dead, or so it seems, and I have memorized longer passages of the Lord of the Rings than I have of the Bible. (Yes, that is tragic.) That tells you how much of a geek I was.
It should also tell you how much I know of the story, and how important precision is to me, when we are talking of the Lord of the Rings. I hated the whole men-are-weak theme that was in this story from the first of Peter Jackson's films, nor did I care for the manifold other changes that the two movies preceding this one had, and I was, I admit, very angry at the end of the Two Towers, so angry that I decided not to watch this movie, and I will not purchase the Two Towers. After all, I know how the story ends.
This oath to myself, chiefly made to keep me from spending another seven dollars just to get angry, set off a long debate in my mind, a debate that also occurred in my circle of friends and family who have read the books/would be interested in this kind of movie. Their vote was unanimous: see the movie, they said. Yet the debate continued until this very week when I finally relented.
I am glad I did. This was the truest of all three films, and the dialogue was perfect, every signicant line being derived in one fashion or another from the books. The most drastic change from the written work was how the Paths of the Dead sequence was done in the film, and that change was easily forgiven. As I said of the first film, the film was editted for integrity, and this film was more so than the other two combined. Not to say that there were no differences between Peter Jackson's film and the written work, but they were forgivable, and none of the scenes were completely fabricated, or ripped out of the Hobbit, as I felt several scenes were in the second film, or changed excessively, unnecessarily, or counterproductively, as I felt several scenes had been in the first.
The best thing about this production, though, was the goal. For all his embellishments, Peter Jackson did not commit the travesty of trying to do anything different with the ending, nor did he try to add some message to it that was his own and not the intention of Pr. Tolkien. John Huston could not resist doing that with the made for television version released in 1980, and that production was just horrid. This production ended just exactly as it should have, and Peter Jackson's attention to detail was such that the last line of the film was the last line of the book. The entire movie was that true to the story, and Peter Jackson was entirely consistent with how he told it, meaning that he never contradicted himself. Four things only did I note about this production, and only people who have studied this series as much as I have would have even noticed (some of) them. First, the scene inside Mount Doom, once they reached it, was lengthened just a bit for dramatic effect. Secondly, the last time Frodo dons the Ring, he puts it on the wrong finger. Thirdly, the final conversation on Mount Doom's slopes makes no mention of Gollum. Finally, the Elvenship mentioned at the end is called the very last elvenship. Still, none of these detract from the story itself and I only mention them because to me they were incredibly obvious. After the second film, I had passed a death sentence on any possibility of watching the third, but the Lord High Executioner granted a pardon, and was not disappointed. Four and three quarter stars or even four....out of four.",1077840000,7,3780,4.440287769784173

7272406,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"RELEASED 2003 and directed by Peter Jackson, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King adapts the third part of JRR Tolkiens popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth: Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) continue to try to make their way to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Meanwhile Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom), Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen), King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Faramir (David Wenham) join forces to fight Sauron's army at the stone city of Minas Tirith and, later, draw the forces of Modor out as a distraction for Frodo to accomplish his goal. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are on hand as Hobbits Pippin and Merry.

While Im a casual fantasy/adventure fan and have read numerous books of the genre (e.g. Conan, Tarzan, Gor, etc.), Ive never read Tokien, likely because Im not into Hobbits, Elves and Dwarfs. After viewing the three movies, The Lord of the Rings strikes me as a mixture of Robin Hood, Conan and The Wizard of Oz, which all possibly influenced Tolkiens writing of the Rings trilogy in 1937-1949. So, if you think a meshing of Conan the Barbarian (1982) and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991) with The Wizard of Oz (1939) sounds good, then youll probably like these movies more than me.

The Return of the King is just more of the same showcased in the first two movies, but even LONGER. Take the Battle of Minas Tirith, for example. Its basically the same as The Battle at Helms Deep in the previous movie, except with colossal elephant-like creatures and the Army of the Dead. These two battles are similar enough that they couldve been condensed into one conflict. Speaking of the Army of the Dead, this was an interesting new element, as was the horrifying spider-monster that Frodo & Sam face inside the caves.

Like the first two movies, the characters are diverse, the tale is creative, theres a lot of dark action rounded out by softer scenes and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS magnificent. Unfortunately, as with The Two Towers, theres excessive use of CGI (aka CGI porn). If cartoony CGI is your thang then youll likely appreciate this installment more than me.

There are other problems: While the characters are inspired, they're also thin and rather uninteresting, at least for mature people who require more depth to hold their attention. Take Legolas (Bloom), for example; we never get to know him. Or consider Aragorn: Mortensen is perfect as the noble warrior, but in the ENTIRE trilogy he probably only has like two full pages of dialog, maybe three. Also, I found the story generally disengaging. I was never much enthralled by the characters and their pursuits, although devotees of Tolkien might be.

Then there are WAY too many looks of love between characters, particularly Frodo and Sam (I was so happy to see one character get married and have kids, if you catch my drift). Theres also a sense of redundancy, like the aforementioned battles (Helms Deep and Minas Tirith). Or consider the hokey dangling from a cliff by ones fingers: This was already done with Gandalf at the end of the first part and beginning of the next. Did we really need the entire trilogy to come down to this type of eye-rolling clich?

Another problem is the lack of feminine protagonists. Theres Miranda Otto as owyn, Thoden's niece, who becomes infatuated with Aragorn and masquerades as a warrior-ess. Other than that all we have are cameos by Liv Tyler (Arwen), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) and a Hobbits wife. Mythica: A Quest for Heroes (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the creators knew enough to throw in a couple of prominent babes as heroines in the story. So did Conan the Barbarian and Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God (2005). Its not rocket science.

As noted above, the movies needlessly overlong and things couldve been condensed in the trilogy or omitted altogether. When the main storyline ultimately ends at Mount Doom I was thinking there was maybe 12-15 minutes left with half of that time being credits. Nope, there was STILL 30 MINUTES LEFT wherein boring goodbyes and looks of love are tacked on.

Despite these honest quibbles, The Return of the King, and the trilogy in general, was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, particularly those who favor Tolkien, Hobbits, Elves, Gnomes and the like.

THE MOVIE RUNS 3 hours 21 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.

7272432,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Tolkien had been to the wars and had seen battles first-hand. He had heard and seen his fellow soldiers lose heart and fear that hope was lost. In his book, The Hobbit and the three books of the Lord of the Rings, he always assures us that we should always know that hope is right with us, and that we may have to find extraordinary ways to make that hope come true. But we can make that hope come true.

There was more to the story beyond the movie ""The End"". Do find a copy of the actual book, and read further to the last page. I always cry when I come to this part. Yet I know that there is a light of hope shining for each and every one of us, and we must have faith that it will always be there for us.

7272441,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I just saw this film in high definition with subtitles and the ""x-ray"" commentary, and I feel these enhance the experience.  They might make it more mystifying, though, for those who haven't read the book.  Even while greatly enjoying the screen presentation, you can tell that the film might be withholding more than what it is revealing. So I recommend, for a full comprehension of what this is all about, to read the book.  But read the Silmarillion as well - not necessarily the Hobbit, which is really neither here nor there. The Silmarillion goes all the way back to the beginning - and has all the origin stories and drama of the ancestors of the current characters, as well as some of the characters themselves, whose age is in the thousands of years! It explains the ""hierarchy"" of the different types of creatures and their powers, and how they got where they are - creatures such as the Balrog and Shelob, the Wizards, the Elves, the Dwarves, the royal line of men, even the Hobbits themselves. The film puts it all together beautifully, but those who care about it will want more.",1517616000,3,1092,4.647668393782383

Also Sam does not get the opportunity to try out his ring skills.

Mean while back at the ranch. Oops Minas Tirith prepares for a major battle. Aragorn sees dead people. We see a flaming Denethor (John Noble). If they survive the battle then they must prepare to confront Sauron of Mordor to distract him from his real threat (Frodo).

The absents of the scouring of the Shire we still get the feel if not an added extra as the four Hobbits having been places and seeing sights that are unfathomable to the other residents of the Shire look knowingly at each other.

Comments on the four hours and ten minute version suggests that the is quite a bit more footage that is not seen here and may never be. This includes information on many of the characters after the final confrontation.

The profits from the other two and the assured profit of this one probably had a great deal to do with that. The negative thing about that, however, is more and more movies are about the visual and not the story. This one, even with the visual, was indeed about the story. I read the book in college back in the 60's. I know I had visualized the characters and the places as I read. I don't remember them exactly but I cannot believe they were all that different from what I saw on the screen.

There are movies I can and do watch again and again (Casablanca, To Kill a Mockingbird, Red River, several Hitchcock). These three fall into that category.",1474588800,,749,4.2377622377622375

7272681,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"SOOOO GOOOOD! If you have never seen The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, I HIGHLY recommend it. It is an excellent trilogy. I especially love the extended editions. I know they add even more screen time to a daunting trilogy, but they add much more depth to the characters and storylines. If you are not yet ready to tackle the extended editions, start out with the regular versions and if you like those, then watch the extended editions and you will enjoy spotting the extra scenes and getting more back story. Again, I HIGHLY recommend these films. They are timeless and beautiful. (I also recommend the books if you like the films)

Just for reference, the order of the films is as follows:
1. Fellowship of the Rings
2. Twin Towers
3. Return of the King

P.S. These are a million times better than the Hobbit films, if you did not like the Hobbit films, do not let that keep you from these excellent films.",1467763200,8,906,4.484848484848484

7272703,5,B00Z9YZRVE,It was truly great to see how a tiny hope and the actions of the few can be to great effect.  You carry the fates of us all little one and so he does right into the fires of Mount Doom!  This is a great plug for short people.  It seems to be a big American culture thing for short people to want to be tall.  Well I'm tall and the world wasn't made for someone my size.  Sure I can travel faster on foot than a short person but who walks around anymore when they can drive?  Speaking of driving why are all economy cars so small?  I want to save on gas too!  This story is great.  It has a lot of depth.  The characters are fairly well developed if you have followed the story to this movie and you really get a sense for how difficult the journey really is just to drop a piece of gold in volcano.  Okay so the ring is more than just a piece of gold and the volcano is extremely difficult to get to.  This was really well played and well done.  Great job to all the makers.,1464998400,,974,3.883248730964467

I can't even describe it with enough words. I mean, I thought the original exceeded my expectations. This one SMASHED them to pieces and ground them into dust.

From the Path of the Dead, to the extra scenes during the final battle, to the sailing towards the Gray Havens, I could not be more floored by what an amazing job Jackson did with the finale. I don't think I've watched a movie since that's equaled this trilogy.

7272845,1,B00Z9YZRVE,"I really THOUGHT my first criticism, before watching, would have to do with diverging from the book.

While it definitely did, I was wrong.

My FIRST complaint was, while watching all the Minas Tirith parts, I irresistibly started comparing this film to Army of Darkness.

On the one hand, so many Minas Tirith scenes seemed to purposely copy that film beat for beat.  On the other hand, the action - charming and entertaining in Army of Darkness, was boring, mind-numbing, and endless in Return of the King.

One divergence (of MANY) by Jackson was having Gandalf personally micro-manage one particular group of soldiers.  ""Okay now use ARROWS!  But shoot at the trolls!  Okay now fight REALLY hard!""

This was FUNNY in Army of Darkness when Ash does it precisely BECAUSE it is dumb.  Ash is a know-it all boorish man from the future who has no business bossing around a castle full of knights.  So you KNOW he's gotta do it.

Gandalf apparently is taking over running the defense of this ginormous city by yelling the most obvious orders to the few men within direct earshot on one particular section of wall.  And then defending it himself by whacking orcs with his staff - also just on this one particular section of wall.  If Gandalf was CGI-rendered, this would have as little appeal as Yoda with a lightsabre, but it's not far off.

Gee, the men of Gondor have only been waging warfare against Mordor for generations, they wouldn't know ANYTHING about defending a city against Mordor.  Where would they have gotten such experience?  Minas Ithil?  Osgiliath? Cair Andros?  Nope.  They wouldn't lift a finger if Gandalf wasn't yelling at them to do it right over their shoulders.  All these scenes are dumb, annoying, but worst of all, BORING.

Ash and Gandalf are doing essentially the same things in these movies, and for these sections, Army of Darkness blows away Return of the King.  Better scripted action sequences, dialogue, pacing, editing.  All Peter Jackson really had to do was match Lord of the Rings beat for beat.  He doesn't NEED to directly copy or compete with Army of Darkness, he has some fantastic ideas from Tolkien to work with instead.

So we miss the scene with Gandalf stopping the wraith king at the gates.  We have a much worse handled version of Eowyn's fight with the nazgul.  We miss the really great scene after Eomer finds Theoden dead and thinks Eowyn is dead.  We miss the banner of Elendil unfurling on the corsair ships because, well, the Dunadain can't be on the ships.  Because they got written out of Helm's Deep in the last movie.  Nor apparently does Aragorn bring the armies of Lebenin and Belfalas with him.  We miss Faramir's fighting retreat and Dol Amroth's valour.

But we DO get a lot of bloated bad dialogue not written by Tolkien, bloated bad action, and where Tolkien's words are used, they're placed in a less effective point in the story than Tolkien put it and mangled.  And oddly, some of the scenes inside Minas Tirith feel slightly claustrophobic and small for such a gigantic fortress, while the castle from Army of Darkness, despite no CGI being available at the time, feels comparitively spacious and large.

Had Peter Jackson not padded the film with mind-numbingly dumb extra dialogue and action and scenes that were never in the book, he'd have had time for scenes like the conversation at Orthanc and the more interesting and dramatic way they get the Palantir.

And yes, Denethor is a not disgusting and totally unlikeable moron  He is noble, extremely observant, intelligent, and formidible before he breaks under the pressure.  Theoden does not ask why they should help Gondor.  Denethor has already lit the beacon fires long before Gandalf gets to Minas Tirith.  Denethor does not send his son out on a suicide mission, does not have bad table manners, does not weep in public, is not a coward.  Gandalf does not spend a lot of time hitting things with a stick.  Giant elephants were never part of the story.  Aragorn starts the journey from Rivendell with Narsil.  Arawen does not deliver it to him like a sandwich or pizza despite not having any chance of knowing where he would be at this point.  Gandalf does NOT drag pippin back when he offers his service to Denethor, he actually has a speech explaining why he DIDN'T.  Both hobbits aren't given swords in Return of the King because the blades of Westernesse from the barrows were given back to them at Isengard by Aragorn, so Pippin is NOT shoved back by Gandalf and DOES lay his sword at the feet of Denethor, who recognizes what it is.

Just like with The Hobbit, Jackson's changes are nearly endless and pointless.  They don't help the story.  They clearly aren't made to make it a more concisely written story because often the changes make the movie more bloated and whatever savings might possibly were made are erased by all the boring, bloated, non-Tolkien additions.

So my recommendation is watch Army of Darkness instead of this",1447632000,2,4970,4.7555555555555555

The characters have more depth because of the backstories. Many of the plot elements make more sense and take on more meaning because parts that were originally taken out for length are now included with no reduced production quality. The entire film is still flawless. This is a masterpiece.",1445472000,14,457,5.026315789473684
7272867,1,B00Z9YZRVE,"I know people will discount this, but I've got to say it. I know Peter Jackson won awards for these movies. If you take a 5,000 carat almost flawless diamond, and cut it down to a 10 carat flawed diamond, it's still better than all the cruddy 1 carat badly cut diamonds out there and you'll get awards for it.

If you're unfamiliar with the books, this is a ""good movie"". Great cinematography, mostly good acting, a gripping story, the whole nine yards.

If you've read the books, this movie might be a gross disappointment. All the beauty of the dialogue and ideas created by a master storyteller was stripped out, to be replaced with idiotic fight scenes and 4th rate dialogue made up by some schlub with pizza and drool hanging from his beard.

I sat around and rewatched part 3 a few nights ago, and that's what prompted this review. In the books, there's a clear code of honor and truth and nobility among the ""good guys"", which provides a ready contrast with the evil of the bad guys: ""I would not snare even an orc with a falsehood"" says Faramir at one point, while subsequently refusing to use his position of power to seize the ring:

""We are truth-speakers, we men of Gondor. We boast seldom, and then perform, or die in the attempt. ""Not if I found it on the highway would I take it,"" I said. Even if I were such a man as to desire this thing, and even though I knew not clearly what this thing was when I spoke, still I should take those words as a vow, and be held by them.

Contrast this to the movie. Frodo lies when asked about Gollum (""there was no other"", as opposed to ""a chance companion we met on the road, I am not answerable for him""), and Faramir binds him to take him back to Minas Tirith to seize the ring.

If you want entertainment, watch the movie. If you want entertainment and beauty and nobility and hope and fear and triumph, read the books. The worst part is that idiotic (IMO) dialogue and action scenes were substituted for some of the best storytelling ever written in the English language. I realize the books are long, and a truly faithful adaptation is impossible due to time constraints. That doesn't mean you pull out jewels to make room for garbage.

7272901,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"This is NOT the Lord of the Rings, this is a Peter Jackson story and movie.

I grew up on the Lord of the Rings.  I've read it so often that I practically have it memorized.  Jackson's ""adaptation"" of the story in all three of these movies strips the magic and the majesty from the story to fit a commercial plot line.

So very much that was vital to the emotional impact of Tolkien's vision was removed and replaced by pablum.  Too much that was never in the books was added, and all of Jackson's additions detract from the tale.

Every time I see even a short snippet of Jackson's movies, I feel angry.

The CGI is good, so two stars - but only to the programmers.  This is a sad maladaptation of an epic tale and Jackson has no shame.",1440892800,,737,4.177304964539007

If you like movies with a lot of races you got to watch this one this movie shows you a lot of races that are important in this movie not only the protagonist race is doing a good job in the movie but all this is why this movie is perfect for me i think but if you like these types of movie you will say the same thing like me. The plot for this movie is there is one ring that give you power that may let you do incredible things but if that ring went back to sauron it will be a disaster that will let him dominate the world, the heroes of this movie must take the ring to the mountain and drop it in the volcano and this will destroy the evil. There are many interesting things in this movie like wars, blood, love, and dragons who doesn't like dragons. i really recommend this movie for people who like action and interesting things about races and mission you cant fail to achieve and about the fate chose a small person to do an incredible thing. Also this movie teach you an important thing we all need to learn and its the Friendship is more important than anything else, friendship leads you to many different things in this world like successes in your life and enjoy every moment as possible.",1436227200,,1352,4.16412213740458

For those who don't know or care, 'Return of the King' is a great ending to one of the best fantasy epic adaptations of our time.

Would've been more interesting if Captain Jack Sparrow made an appearance. I guess the girl from the Aerosmith videos was cool. Been better if she was naked bit I guess it was OK cause it was PG.

7272970,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"The Return of the King rounds out the Lord of the Rings trilogy in fine fashion, as this movie is a whopping 4+ hours in length (extended version). I give all 3 Lord of the Rings 4 stars. Why? Being brutally honest, I think these movies are too long, allowing the mind to wander, which tells me that I only LIKE the trilogy, rather than LOVE it. Yes, I'm a fan of Tolkien, but these movies can drag, and CGI seems out of place for this type of genre. I think a more raw movie would've resonated better. Yes, this is just one person's opinion. The Return of the King is a good movie, but not one that excites me to the core. Still, I recommend it for its beauty and engaging storyline.",1431475200,,684,4.150375939849624

7273030,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Few movie experiences have been as sublime or heartrending as the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which began with the forming of a Fellowship and grew with the battle against the Two Towers.

And in ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,"" Peter Jackson brings JRR Tolkien's epic fantasy to its powerful, heartbreaking close. While the ending is notoriously gradual to unfold -- not surprising in a story this long and complicated -- it's a glorious experience that can only end in beauty, sorrow and the ultimate battle between good and evil.

Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still following the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the path to Mordor, with Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realizes his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel to get Frodo back.

Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. Not only is the city under siege, but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his one remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the joined forces of Gondor and Rohan will not be enough to stop Sauron unless Frodo destroys the Ring -- and with his mind being worn away by its evil, he might not be able to.

The ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess.

Peter Jackson manages to craft a genuine sense that this is an epic story -- the scope of the story grows even larger when Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith, especially when we see the sweeping grandeur of the signal fires. And of course, he sweeps through a series of increasingly explosive battle scenes (involving oliphaunts, Black Riders and glow-in-the-dark ghosts). Each action scene a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't.

But if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. They cry, they hug, they think about home -- such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into equally rich movie dialogue.

Elijah Wood gives an unparalleled performance as Frodo Baggins. Frodo's gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the ""strong"" unbowed hobbit, rather than the follower (""I can't carry it for you... but I can carry you!""). The final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated.

But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, as both younger hobbits are forced to deal with the horrors of war. Ian McKellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom, and Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto as the despairing Eowyn and David Wenham as the noble, kindly Faramir all give amazing performances. And of course, the titular king is Mortensen's Aragorn, now faced with the ultimate challenges -- and possibly the ultimate sacrifices -- that will decide whether he falls or triumphs over Sauron.

Perhaps the most striking thing about ""Return of the King"" is the final fourth of the film. While the ""multiple endings"" may annoy some viewers, it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden, splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending, Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron.

""Return of the King"" brings the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy to a close, and cements Jackson's reputation as a master filmmaker. With the outstanding cast, beautiful scripting and amazing direction, this is a fitting capstone to the trilogy.",1425945600,,4837,4.931203931203931

7273195,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"Enjoyable conclusion to the saga, although the weary, can't-go-on Frodo character does get a bit tiring. I know the ring is pure evil and all of that, but the long shots of sad, red eyes reflect how I feel on Monday mornings a little too closely. The CGI also seems a bit more noticable with this one, namely the battle sequences, but I guess that's just what you have to do to make a film like this. The final send-off of the characters was a nice touch, with everyone basically coming in to visit the recovering Frodo, slowly, with cheesy grins and a tear or two. A tad maudlin, but it worked. The series was excellent all things considered.",1415664000,,643,4.411764705882353

7273197,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"The concluding volume of Peter Jackson's trilogy clocks in at over three hours (I can only imagine what the ""extended version"" runs!), so if you have wiggly kids in your family, you might want to screen it in two parts.  Most of it is given over to vast set-piece battles, notably the assault on Minas Tirath, the White City, capitol of Gondor, where resurrected wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan), now known as Mithrandir, the White Rider, and hobbit Pippin (Billy Boyd) find themselves facing a massive force of orcs and trolls, their only hope being the Rohirrim, the Riders of Rohan--if they've seen, and respond to, the beacon Pippin surreptitiously lit under the nose of the grieving Steward, Denethor (John Noble).  Meanwhile Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the last heir of the ancient royal house of the realm, elf-archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), accompanying the Riders, turn aside to recruit some very dangerous assistance that may make all the difference, while Pippin's kinsman Merry (Dominic Monaghan) is with King Theoden (Bernard Hill)--and his disguised niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto)--as they race to the battle, and an ever-more-exhausted Frodo (Elijah Wood) and the faithful Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) struggle on through the wastelands of Mordor toward Mount Doom, trying to deal with the continued assaults of the One Ring on Frodo's mind and their schizophrenic guide Gollum/Smeagol (Andy Serkis), whose initial acquisition of the Ring is finally shown in an opening sequence.

The centerpiece of the film is of course the battle for Minas Tirath, followed by an equally desperate demonstration by Aragorn's army before the Black Gate, which they hope will distract Sauron's Eye long enough for Frodo to accomplish his mission.  But besides the land, the Ring, and Gollum, Frodo has another foe to face--a gigantic spider that haunts the tunnels under Sauron's tower.

The highpoint of all this is the fantastic special effects, from the battles with their raging trolls, wonderful war machines, and ""olyphants""--elephant-like creatures about twice the size (and speed) of our own, with four tusks apiece, one set fantastically curved--plus the nine Nazgul on their flying dragons, to the mass army of ghosts recruited by Aragorn, to the seething lava of Mount Doom.  Gandalf, taking over command of the city defenses when Denethor won't, displays a new side of his character--he's an inspiring and clever war leader--while Pippin and Merry each demonstrate a courage about three times their own size.  And Eowyn, facing the Nazgul king chosen by Sauron to lead his armies to war, turns out to play a pivotal role--for ""no man can slay [him],"" but Eowyn is, as she herself observes, ""no man!""  It would have been nice to know why Aragorn finally decided to claim his rightful throne, what happened to Saruman in the end, and what awaits Frodo on the last phase of his journeyings, three years after the great confrontation; perhaps all that is covered in the extended cut.  On the whole, though, this is a thoroughly satisfying ending to the trilogy, and shouldn't disappoint those who've stuck with it.",1415577600,,3145,5.138943248532289

7273247,5,B00Z9YZRVE,my personal opinion is if you have time to watch the LORD OF THE RINGS then you have time to watch the extended edition as well! no excuses! I will never watch the simple editions again. These versions have more of what I consider crucial character development! You just miss out on too much that is necessary to fully grasp what is going on with each character!,1410566400,,362,4.417910447761194

It is even better. More Lord of the Rings is always a yes in my book. Don't  let the 4 hours and 10 minutes scare you away. If you love Lord of the Rings (and buy buying this you probably should be) than it is worth every penny and then some more.,1409788800,,418,3.9761904761904763

7273348,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Intense does not even begin to describe how this final film of the trillogy flows. This was a very good way that the writers wrapped up the trillogy. That said...my only negative is the ending. From the point of Froto waking up from his exhaustive journey to the very last word...was kinda cheesy. The hugging and the crying and the laughing took way too long...I mean we are talking 10 minutes or more, just too long. This chessynous does not however take away fro mthe 5 stars awarded.

There's lots of inconsistencies in this one, and it's mostly because Peter Jackson's chickens are coming home to roost.

Now in all fairness, the description didn't list this. But seriously, I could go pay for the discs, watch the deleted scenes AND rip the discs to my harddrive.
Not a deal. You lose 3 stars for being evil, Amazon and Hollywood.

My boyfriend has never seen them so of course we started watching them. English is not his first language, although he speaks fluently, the ""old English"" accent throws him off so we needed to watch it with subtitles.

I was very disappointed with the subtitles in the Amazon Instant Video. They are not timed at all with the film, for example you would read the lines 5 seconds before the actor would say them. It kind of ruined the movie, and it was a pain in the butt.

I tried using different browsers, restarting the movie, etc but nothing fixed the delay.

So long story short: rent this movie if you don't need subtitles! It was great, crisp picture, very beautiful.

if you DO need subtitles then you're better off finding a different source.",1391472000,,880,4.440993788819876

We loved the ease of renting from Amazon.com directly from our smart TV.  The movie was immediately available for us to watch.  It was very convenient not having to go out to the video store to rent it & then return it....and the best part was the picture was perfect.

7273459,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"For as little as this film has to work with, plot wise, there's really no excuse for how long it clings to the screen. Really, in the grand scheme of things, what does it accomplish? A big battle scene to preserve the sacred city of Gondor, a recruitment drive in the land of the dead to facilitate the former, Frodo and Sam's arrival at Mordor and the big finale at the lava pit. Some exposition can be expected, naturally, and in a few scattered cases it does serve to enrich the extended universe, but for those four primary points to devour over four hours of screen time seems ridiculously excessive.

The wealth of character moments on display in Return of the King are generally well done, but rarely do they feel as essential as they did in previous chapters. With very little exception, the primary cast has already worked through their individual arcs before the title card, so there isn't much meat in that respect.

As with The Two Towers, the fight scenes (scattered liberally throughout) are appropriately epic and pulse-pounding, though these too push the limits in terms of what the viewing audience is willing to let slide. We're already suspending our disbelief a fair distance in regards to the fellowship's universal fighting prowess, but one particular scene with Legolas and an elephant seems more than a bit excessive. In fact, Legolas is granted an especially silly amount of battlefield respect throughout the series.

I could dwell on the negatives all day long - I haven't even touched on the stupid amount of slow motion in the farewell scenes - but at the end of the day, this really isn't a bad film just a madly bloated one. It's thoroughly rewarding to finally conclude our journey with the residents of Middle Earth, and when the plot finally gets around to waving goodbye it's a powerful experience. I just can't help but wonder how much better a slim two-hour cut, trimming off half the body fat of the original, would play to the same material. Oh, and its status as a Best Picture winner? Clearly that was a lifetime achievement award for the trilogy at large, because The King is far and away LOTR's weakest installment.",1388880000,,2158,4.73404255319149
7273460,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I still cannot see how they could cut these scenes from theatrical.  The movie gets so expanded upon with the additional scenes.

I usually do this one when I am taking off my hat) -- on and on!

Despite not having read the books in high school, I found the first three films absolutely riveting and well done.  My husband (who had read the books) also agreed and found the movies, for the most part, closely aligned to the book content.  The latter movies (Hobbit, Des. Smog), however, we both agree, have fallen prey to the Star Wars syndrome -- great effects, overproduced action scenes, sillier characters and dialogue, weaker plot and character development.  As per my husband, he found the more recent films to be quite overstretched  (particularly knowing that there are two more movies still), and the introduction of characters, etc. that were not at all in the book to be too much of a stretch of ""artistic license.""  The kids will definitely love the newer films anyway, and we will most likely see the ensuing out of curiosity but without high hopes.

7273501,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This movie is just badass. From start to finish. By far my favorite film of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy but that's not short changing the first two films which are also awesome. This film wouldn't be as exciting if it wasn't for the first two films so DO NOT skip to this film first without watching Fellowship and Two Towers. This is the climax to one of the greatest Trilogies ever put on film and to watch them out of order would be cinema blasphemy and doing a real disservice to yourself.
I know a lot of people complained that there were ""too many endings"" to this film but an epic of this scope needed closure on multiple levels and you'll get that. Too many times you're left wondering what happened to certain characters or wishing you could have seen a particular scene that is only alluded to by the film makers. You want get that here since every single loose end is tied up.
This film won a best picture Oscar and there's a reason why. The effects on the creatures and the fight scenes are all top notch, the performances from every single actor is outstanding especially Viggo Mortensen and Elijah Wood. It's so rare for the third film in a trilogy to actually deliver in every aspect possible and this film completely does that.
If you love action, adventure or sword & sorcery films then this is for you. If you love movies that feature monsters and creatures getting their asses handed to them by badass human beings then this is definitely for you. There's everything from evil goblins, to giant spiders, to massive trolls and ghosts.

7273528,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"The Return of the King concludes the Lord of the Rings film trilogy. On release it was one of the most-lauded movies of all time, receiving eleven Oscars which tied it with Ben-Hur and Titanic for the record, and becoming the second-highest grossing movie in history. However, critical reappraisals of the film over the past decade have been more mixed.

On the positive side, much of the craftsmanship, attention to detail and acting skills of the first two movies have carried over into this one. The actors all do good work (even if Viggo Mortensen as 'King' Aragorn is distinctly less convincing than his depiction of Strider the Ranger) and are bolstered by the addition of John 'Walter Bishop from Fringe' Noble as Denethor. Denethor isn't very well-written, but Noble gives his heart and soul in the role and manages to sell it, inconsistencies, unconvincing-flaming-death-plunges, warts and all. The effects are impressive, with the miniature work on Minas Tirith and its combination with CGI and physical sets being breathtaking. The CGI for Gollum has been upgraded as well, improving upon the already near-flawless work on the second film. There's some genuine power to iconic scenes from the book as they are realised in the film: the Ride of the Rohirrim is amazing, the battle with Shelob (which could have looked very silly) is extremely well-done, the lighting of the beacons is inspiring and Sean Astin's work as Sam on the slopes of Mount Doom is highly impressive. The decision to cast Andy Serkis as the pre-Ring Gollum is also inspired, and the resulting prequel sequence for the movie is tremendously effective.

But, for all of its high points, the film suffers in several areas. The most notable is pacing. The three-and-a-half hour cinematic cut is simply too long, with too many climaxes. The novel averts this problem by inserting the thematically vital Scouring of the Shire sequence into the midst of the ending, giving the Hobbits a crisis they need to overcome by themselves before matters are fully resolved. The absence of the Scouring, though understandable for time and budgetary reasons, weakens the ending of the story on screen and makes the final sequence of goodbyes and farewells somewhat interminable. Something that should have definitely been cut is the 'dying Arwen' storyline, which is utterly nonsensical, doesn't make any sense and leeches the life out of the film whenever it appears. Whilst it was nice of the film-makers to try to involve Arwen more in the storyline, it is so badly-handled they really shouldn't have bothered. This also leads to the bizarre scene in which Elrond teleports to Rohan (making something of a mockery of the extremely tough journey everyone has endured, if he can just replicate it in a few days with ease) and gives Aragorn his sword, which he could have just done before they left Rivendell as in the book. These problems can be boiled down to the producers not trusting Tolkien and the book and instead inserting lots more fake drama and jeopardy into the storyline in an unnecessary attempt to spice things up when things are tense enough and the stakes high enough already.

Another problem is an overreliance on CGI and effects. The Return of the King features a startling three times as many effects shots as The Fellowship of the Ring and this leads to, at times, the film starting to slide into the Star Wars prequel trilogy problem of things looking too fake and unconvincing. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields is visually impressive and it would be difficult to do it without CGI, but there's too many shots where it's obvious the actors are waving swords in front of greenscreens. This fakery lets down the battle a little, and renders it less impressive overall than the much more tightly-orchestrated Battle of Helm's Deep from the previous film. There's also the decision to use the Army of the Dead to save the day at the Pelennor Fields, which is a cheap and easy way of resolving the situation but also a nonsensical one: in the book the Army can be used once and once only, and vanishes after Aragorn uses it to seize the fleet at Pelargir. In the film it can be used until Aragorn says so, and it's hard to argue with Gimli's suggestion they carry on using it until Sauron is defeated (what's a few more days to an army that's been cursed for a thousand years?). The dumbing-down from the book in an apparent attempt to avoid having to cast Prince Imrahil and use Gondor's actual army is bizarre, as that would not have been particularly time-consuming anyway.

Ultimately, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (***) does not have so many problems that those who loved the first two films will hate this one and some of those problems (the increased use of portentous and pretentious dialogue, for example) are taken straight from the book. But The Return of the King remains the weakest link in the trilogy, where self-indulgence - particularly with regards to length, spectacle and effects - are allowed on a few too many occasions to override the storytelling and characters.

Note on the Extended Edition: As with its predecessors, The Return of the King was re-released a year after its original release with new material added. In this case there is about 45 minutes of new scenes. Some of these scenes are actually very good, with the final confrontation with Saruman being something that should never have been cut out in the first place. However, too many scenes go over information we already know, add little to the narrative and in a few cases are excruciatingly awful. The scene where Aragorn seizes the pirate ships is badly-acted, badly-written and appallingly self-indulgent (the crew of the pirate ship is made up of behind-the-scenes crewmembers). Even Jackson on the commentary admits it isn't every good, which makes it a bit odd that they put it back. The less also said about the 'billion skull rockslide', the better. The biggest problem is that, Saruman scene aside, the Extended Edition does not add anything essential to the film and drags its already overlong run time to well over the four hour mark. Accordingly, the Extended Edition (***) is in this case not the definitive version and should only be watched if you are a completionist.",1378944000,2,6276,4.856209150326797

This, however, would have either added at least an hour to a three hour film, or else might have required a fourth film, as would have happened if they'd included everything they didn't have in the film.  Still, to kind of paraphrase Shakespeare, ""I come to praise this effort, not to bury it!""  The final film is one helluvan action packed flick, and believe thee me, they pulled out all the stops in making the last battle.

Haven't looked at the special features, since I really only cared about the movie.",1370995200,,337,5.222222222222222
7273588,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"I've seen this movie before, but remember almost nothing about it. I re-watched it and concluded that it had similar flaws to Two Towers, but here are some notes.

SPOILERS!

--The film opens with two tards named Smeagol and Deagol. No, I'm not making this up. Deagol finds the ring in the river, then Smeagol kills him for it. I can't help but laugh while writing this. This is hokey stuff.

--Sarumon inexplicably has no power anymore. Well, that's convenient. I guess that powerful wizard wasn't all that powerful after all.

--And speaking of wizards, Gandalf is completely misused. So the scriptwriters (and/or novelist) use a contrived twist to bring him back to life in Two Towers, only to then use him for basic swordsman tasks. Isn't this guy some kind of powerful wizard? Why the hell does he spend almost all of his time riding horses, leading armies, and beating orcs over the head with his staff? Last time I checked, wizards use magic and cast spells. Gandalf is portrayed as a three-trick pony in terms of magic. He can summon eagles, exorcise kings, and make his staff glow. That's about it. If this guy had any real skills, he'd use powerful magic spells during the battles. Apparently, Gandalf is better at using blunt objects. They should have let this guy die in peace during Fellowship.

--This film has the same boring filler material that Two Towers had. Again I ask, what do the characters accomplish during the first two hours of this movie? The humans sit around and prepare for war, which consists of putting on armor and walking or riding around. No battle strategies are discussed whatsoever. Why can't someone write some interesting dialogue for a change? All we get is banal, middling chit chat about honor and the coming fight. It's incredibly tedious stuff.

--Okay, let's take a look at Gollum. Many reviewers (even those who dislike the film) think that he's a well-written character. I disagree. It's rather ironic that his ""good guy"" personality completely disappears early on in the film, which contradicts his persona that was defined in Two Towers. He's just purely evil and manipulative in Return of the King. So I ask, what was the point in giving him a split personality in Two Towers? I'll tell you: it was a cheap gimmick and a lazy way to create a character with fake complexity. Also, at this point I'm frankly getting sick of hearing him say ""precious"" every other sentence. This guy must be one of the most annoying characters ever created.

--Frodo, Sam, and Gollum continue to walk through mostly gray environments, but there is a bit more color in Return of the King when compared to Two Towers. You see, there's a white castle in this one. That's a big step forward for Jackson. Maybe next time he can add a third color to the film's color scheme.

--Liv Tyler still can't act.

--Some super villain called the Witch-king is introduced. Not surprisingly, he barely gets any screen time. He also dies rather easily for being the most powerful of his kind.

--So Aragorn attempts to recruit a ghost army. You'd think that would be difficult, but he waves his special sword around and they immediately follow him. Can't we make this stuff a bit more interesting? Some kind of test, riddle, or obstacle would have made the scene more memorable.

--There's no additional character development for any of the characters in this movie. Even the newer douchebag character named Denethor is wafer thin. There's a scriptwriting contrivance where his son is delivered half-dead but Denethor thinks he's completely dead, so he commits suicide. This despite the fact that he heartlessly sent his son on the suicide mission to begin with. It's kinda stupid, actually.

--The big battle ensues at Minas Tirith. At first it feels impersonal because it involves a lot of stock characters that no one cares about. Also, it's like a rehash of the Helm's Deep battle where hope is almost lost until reinforcements arrive. However, it gets more engaging as it moves along and there are some cool moments, like the giant elephants. Overall, I think it's a good battle.

--We get a memorable moment when Sam fights the giant spider. Definitely one of the best scenes in the film.

--The final hour is both predictable and dull. This film takes forever to end. It's simply not worth slugging through 200 minutes for only a small handful of good moments.

This film won 11 Academy awards. One can only shake their head in disbelief. At heart this is a brainless action movie with thin melodrama masquerading as dramatic depth. Of the numerous awards, Return of the King won for Best Film Editing, which is hilarious.",1370995200,,4644,4.7947434292866085

7273642,5,B00Z9YZRVE,I read the complete works of J.R.R. Tolkein so many times I lost count. Each time I pictured in my mind's eye a very similar version of what Peter Jackson has put on film. I love the way he (for the most part) didn't re-write the story in order to make the movie. Close to the detail that Tolkein placed in his writings.,1363824000,,320,4.095238095238095

7273644,5,B00Z9YZRVE,I have read the books countless times - I do think you need to do them to appreciate the depth of the tale. But still a fabulous movie. - Author Claudia Newcorn,1363737600,,160,4.03125
7273645,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"I'm a guy who watched a 12 French film once. This film, and the whole series, was way too long. This film in particular should have been two hours tops. Yes, the world created by Jackson is amazing and the acting is solid, but as a movie judged by its rhythm and narrative thread, it is clunky and redundant and - frequently - boring.",1363737600,,334,4.234375
7273646,1,B00Z9YZRVE,"IF - If you knew nothing going in the series it is a great way to kill time on a day when all you can do is sit in bed and watch movies. Saw all the shows in the theater originally and can say I've seen the series many times now. Decided to rewatch all 3 after I viewed the Hobbit which I might add was light years better then this.
Good) sets are nicely done, it's pretty to see, Gimli as comedy relief is ok, Eowyn is cute, and did I say the scenery is very nice.
Bad) I personally do not see how any of the supposed fans can rave over this fiasco. Destroyed the books, and ruined what I consider one of the best fantasy tales written. Most -not all but most of the actors stank! Elijah Wood was terrible. Did the actors or for that matter the director even read the series at some point.
Look I don't want to rant completely over the butchery of the proper tale, yet their was no real story here. All the depth and nobility of the characters was horrid. I can truly understand the necessity of cutting aspects out for time but the Director really blew it with what he chose to keep and invent.
Should you watch it - sure - buy it why not - BUT to toss accolades on this junk as Marvelous, Fantastic, true to the story, amazing performances is complete hogwash. My 1 star is for the butchery unequaled since the Dune junk put out.
Do yourself a favor - READ the books, at least you'll have some imagery to go along with it.",1363564800,2,1425,4.0928571428571425

7273674,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This is really the set for an ultimate, hardcore fan. Why? Because we all know these films are long, sometimes painfully so, and this edition adds a good 30 minutes to that already seriously intense running time!
The added footage doesn't inhibit the story, but it doesn't really add a great deal either. It helps to explain small things in the story, but really what it helps to explain are not really any prodding story line questions. More along the lines of, 'oh hey, where did they get that cool bread?'! Now you'll know. Really trivial stuff, but kinda fun if again, you're a hardcore fan.

The extra features are interesting, but after a seemingly endless movie, nobody in our family has even found the will to watch much of it sadly!

The packaging is great and the slipcover sleeve houses a foldout tray that holds three separate dvds. One disc for special features, the other two discs are the feature film. And yep, that was right, the movie won't fit on one single disc. So, you have to stop halfway through and change the disc to continue the film. Thats kind of a drag, but if you're dying for those extra scenes then you just have to deal!

Overall the very beautiful packaging really goes a long way to make up for anything negative about this edition. The discs are held by clear plastic bevels and under the bevels is a gorgeous map of middle earth that spans the three discs. Really lovely. It's an impressive fold out and sure to please any die hard fan of the films and or books!",1361491200,,1500,4.487179487179487

7273690,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The entire movie trilogy was fantastic, but it led up to a rousing finish, and what a finish! This has become one of three gems in my collection. While Jackson may have taken some liberties, I am not such a purist to believe that one must stick to the book like glue in the use of elements in a story. Canon is the blueprint, the basic design, a guideline, yet Jackson took only a few liberties that enhanced the story without stepping out of bounds. Yes, there were ""many endings"" but there were also many lines to tie together before Sam finally got home. And I thought it not too out of bounds for Frodo to fight with Gollum over the Ring, since it had taken possession of him at the very end. i did miss the rooster crowing in the dawn when Gandalf and the Witch King met at the Gate, but the horns made up for that. Shelob was every bit the nightmare that she was in the book, making me jump out of my skin when I first saw her, and she still makes me shudder every time I see her in the picture. All in all, a worthy end to a great collection.",1360713600,2,1049,4.072463768115942

The only Con:  The theatrical version flows better between scenes.  Sometimes the extended edition seems like it just tosses in another scene and maybe they did.

Movie viewing quality: I compared my DVD to the Blu ray.  The blu ray is better, but I wouldn't say it is worth the cost if you already have the extended edition DVD.

7273715,2,B00Z9YZRVE,Not very good quality. Quit half way through. Did get it so cheap. It wasn't worth returning. The sellers service was actually very good though.,1359331200,,144,4.8
7273716,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Whenever I read a book, or several book in a series, I'm usually left a bit wanting when the hit the big screen, because some of the little things just can't be included.

Overall, after breading the books many years ago, it was pleasant to once more 'meet' and enjoy the adventures of the characters so well defined in the books.",1359244800,,330,4.409836065573771
7273717,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"I don't think this is the extended version.  If you look on the image provided of the back of the disc box, you will see at the bottom it says 201 minutes.  My understanding is that the extended version is 250 minutes.  Also, it contains some fairly confusing wording on the back saying that Disc 1 - Blu Ray contains ""Theatrical Trailers, Special Extended DVD Edition Preview and  ...""  well, this is what confused me: is it the extended version or a preview of the extended version?

The amazon description of the product says it contains both the theatrical and extended version on a two sided disc, but I just popped this blu ray back into the player to double check that and it only gave me one play movie option, and since it was the one I watched last night it was not extended.

This is a great movie either way, but I don't think this product delivered what it was supposed to and I feel a little ""cheated"" by some deceptive writing.  Back to the drawing board on the hunt for a blu ray version of Part III.",1359244800,,1016,4.310526315789474

7273722,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Looks great as a set, if you bought the other two, my only complaint is that it doesn't come with the regular version of the movie, only the extended. Maybe I didn't read carefully enough in the description, but that's okay because I wanted the extended anyway! I love that it comes with a little flyer inside that you can send off for a paper sleeve to keep all three movies in, but it expires in 2005 lol. Pretty crazy someone kept this thing sealed in the plastic for that long.

I thought the extra scenes added to the film overall, just as the extra scenes in the first two did. More of Tolkien's book and lore is a good thing as far as I am concerned. The scene with Eowyn and Faramir was nice after seeing her despair about withering into old age alone. Fantastic film overall!",1357603200,,414,4.32051282051282

I had no problems at all with the first two films, but this one refused to come through with acceptable quality no matter how many times I rebooted the router or the Roku. I have never given an item a one star rating, but the quality of this movie at this instance was simply unacceptable; possibly the worst quality I've ever seen on a TV.

Based on the Amazon description common to all three pages, you might think these are extended editions: ""What do you get? Both the theatrical and extended versions of The Return of the King are on one double-sided disc. The versions use seamless branching, meaning that the scenes that are common to both versions are stored on the disc only once. If you choose to watch the extended version, the disc 'branches' out to the added or extended scenes. [...] Bottom line: Do I need this edition? This Limited Edition combination of theatrical and extended versions plus new documentary seems likely to appeal to two camps.""  However, THE INDIVIDUAL BLU-RAYS are NOT EXTENDED EDITIONS.  They contain single-sided blu-rays that only contain the theatrical editions.  The second DVD disc contains documentaries and TV spots.  So, caveat emptor.

I am a fan, but I guess not enough of a diehard to praise the House of Healing scenes.  I did look forward to all, but the House scenes were short segments of actor and the actress looking at each other.  Not much dialogue.  In my opinion, a failure compared to what was expressed in the novel.  Same goes for other extended scenes.

I need the LTR 2, but I am not going to get extended movie for any extra price.

edit :  Got a chance to see Two Towers, extended.  Added scenes blend and contribute to the whole movie better than the Return of the King.  Worth paying for?  IDK.  LOL.",1355011200,,717,4.153284671532846
7273820,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I remember in 2003 when I just was on the edge of my seat waiting for this movie to come out.  Having read the books several years before and having seen the first 2 movies I couldn't wait until this came out.  My high expectations were not let down at all as this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I now watch the extended version, which is about 4 hours long.

This movie consists of the huge battle at Gondor and the final battle fought at the gates of Mordor while the two hobbits Samwise and Frodo make their way across the darkest parts of Mordor to Mount Doom aka Amon Amarth to rid themselves of the ring.  This movie is full of action while the two sides battle.  Gondor seems hopeless as they are being overrun by goblins, orcs, cave trolls.  Will Rohan make it in time to divert the enemy from bringing down Gondor?  The witchking that no man can kill leading the armies against Gondor, how can one that no man can kill be defeated?

One of the advantages of the extended edition is you get to see what becomes of characters such as Eoywn and Faramir which is only hinted to in the theatrical version.  For me this was a very important part because these two characters seem to be ones who have struggled with much suffering throughout the movie.  Oh, speaking of Eoywn, she is told not to go into battle...but...well you know how Eoywn is if you saw The Two Towers.

The story of Gollum, Sam, and Frodo intensifies as Gollum seeks to turn Frodo against Sam hoping to lead Frodo into a trap.  By the time Frodo realizes what is going on, it may be too late.

I could go on about how great this movie is and if you liked the first two, you will not be disappointed with this one.  It is not only action packed but plays well with the characters' inner turmoil such as Faramir continuing to win his father's approval where his father would just as soon have him go out in the battle field and be killed.  There is enough humor in the movie to make a person laugh but it isn't overdone to the point where it takes away from the story.

There are all sorts of meaning that can be made from this movie.  First, those that are opposed to Sauron must overcome their own differences from within in order to truly win.  Rohan doesn't want to come to Gondor's aid because Gondor didn't come to their aid.  Aragorn is struggling to claim a throne that is rightfully his, which he must do in order to give Gondor an advantage against Mordor.  The underlying theme is that people must settle their differences to obtain a higher purpose.  In life people are often divided on what they believe or their world views but these differences need to be set aside in order to improve upon the world we live in.  We need to seek the inner king or queen within us all instead of oppress it.  Only then can we succeed at accomplishing our goals.

The acting in the movie is excellent and very realistic and the graphics are amazing, from the amazing scenery of Gondor to Gollum's facial expressions.  Highly recommended for those who like fantasy and epic movies with a strong meaningful story line.

7273863,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"Even though they've been released several times in different versions and formats, the coming of ""The Hobbit"" has encouraged Warner Bros. to give fans a chance to get the extended editions of all three ""The Lord of the Rings"" films AGAIN in special Blu-ray 5-disc sets. There's no possible way that any stone is left unturned or single piece of behind-the-scenes footage is left unseen after these are delivered.

Each film is over three and a half hours to over four hours long spread out across two discs. Couple those with three discs filled with special features and you have enough ""Lord of the Rings"" to satisfy even the most obsessed Tolkienite or Tolkiendil.

""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy tells the story of the Hobbit Frodo Baggins and his journey to dispose of a powerful ring controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Frodo and eight companions must make their way to the edge of the fiery Mount Doom through deadly trials and tribulations. They meet up with different characters and creatures throughout their long journey.

The best way to describe my feelings about these films is summed up in ""Clerks 2."" There's a lot of walking and then they drop the ring into Mount Doom before walking home again. Alright, I'm partially just kidding. I do like the movies but in no way am I an uber-fan.

Do I think they could've been edited down to a shorter running time even in their theatrical versions? Absolutely! I've never made it through any of the movies in one sitting. Basically, I can only take about an hour and a half to two hours of each film before I have to give myself a mental break. I found the three hour long ""King Kong"" easier to sit through and more entertaining.

My opinion of the films doesn't mean anything in the long run. What matters is that millions of people across the planet absolutely adore ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and just can't get enough of it. The release of the extended editions of the films loaded with bonus material is a present to them.

Each one is presented in pristine high-definition video and audio. The picture is as clean and polished as you've ever seen it. The 6.1 surround mix will fill everyone's home theater system with the sounds of Middle Earth. Every growl of an Orc and whisper of Sauron jumps out of the speakers at the viewer.

There are too many special features to even begin to list. I'll throw out a few to give readers an idea of what to expect. Each volume includes multiple featurettes, documentaries, galleries, maps, and interviews with the cast and crew. As I said above, if there is even one piece of ""making of"" material left I'd be surprised.

""Lord of the Rings"" enthusiasts might be as mad as ""Star Wars"" fans are over the amount of times these movies have been released at first. However after seeing the amount of special features is included in these different five-disc sets, I'm sure they'll get over it. If you're looking for an exhaustive experience as a Tolkienite or Tolkiendil, ""The Lord of the Rings"" Extended Edition 5-Disc Sets are guaranteed to satisfy your cravings.",1346976000,,3069,4.649446494464945

Once I've found 37 hours to have some friends over for a marathon I'll return and give my opinion of the upgraded format. For now this is just a review of the packaging and other things I noticed that might impact someones decision to buy or not.

I ordered these separate extended sets because I had read many reviews for the extended trilogy blu-ray set saying 'the Fellowship' has a green (I think it was green) hue prevalent throughout. I did read one review saying the issue could be resolved with some TV adjustments. Beyond that inconvenience I was hoping two things would be different with these sets: first I thought maybe the green issue would be fixed (I'll let you know if that's the case in my update for 'fellowship'), and second I was thinking maybe a more understandable reason for a re-release would be to make all 5 discs (15 between three films) blu-ray. This is not the case. That was the first thing I checked and all the non-feature discs say DVD, while the two discs for the main feature say blu-ray.

To sum up, I am happy I bought these sets if only for the beautiful cover art on each. If you don't care about the cover art, if you're not worried about having 15 blu-ray discs total, and if the possibility of a green-less 'fellowship' isn't a big deal, then it probably doesn't matter if you buy these sets or the whole trilogy blu-ray set.

I'll update hopefully soon with info on the films themselves.

Update:

So I've finally watched the film since purchasing and I want to give my thoughts as I did with ""Fellowship"". I really can't say much. The movie looks great, but it looked great in 2003 also. I feel like the images are crisper and colors more vivid, but without a side-by-side comparison it's hard to tell. Snobs might complain but they're just wanting to be heard when they do.

Enjoy. :)",1346889600,2,2295,4.502403846153846

The entire Lord of The Rings series and their predecessor,""The Hobbit "" are a must read for every child in your household.

I read them outloud to my kids and we still watch the DVD's together. They have now introduced them to their own children.  This special boxed set is so beautiful. The strange way in which I was led to these wonderful books and the stories of Middle Earth , was that I saw a guy wearing a tee shirt that said ""Frodo Lives"". I asked what it meant and the rest is history. I guess alot of kids in college were wearing these tee shirts in the 70's.",1345334400,,785,4.376712328767123

The two unlikely heroes prevail. The bitter end is a bit ""over the top"" and it should have ended with the the completion of the book. It almost leads one to believe there is another chapter in this saga when there is none to be had. It was a bit of a down-turn to the entire saga and hence the reason for only 4 out of 5 stars.

7273888,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"I'll begin with my thoughts on the movie: it was too long with way too many endings.  I thought the scene between Arwen and Aragorn slobbering all over each other at his coronation was cringe-worthy (I mean honestly... they did everything but dry hump).  the third movie also ignored parts of the book in favor of adding scenes that appeared to be ad hoc with no other purpose than to extend the movie by a good 45 minutes.

Now on to the packaging:  I've watched the DVD's a few times, and some of the little round tab buttons in the package have snapped off, entombing the DVD in the case.  While trying to pry out the DVD for the second half of the movie, it snapped in half!  The packaging otherwise looks slick, but they could have sprung for the extra 5 cents a package to get something more durable and unbreakable than the highly-fracturable plastic they used.",1330041600,,868,4.462025316455696

The story is good as well as most of the action sequences but this one tends to go on and on and the final battle at the black gate of Murdor is a bit anti climatic after all we have seen in the previous films. An example in this film is Frodo's scenes with the spider which seemed to just go on and on taking away from the battle of Gondor.

As always, it has great characters and an amazing plot and scenery.  The cinematics were phenomenal given that it was made 8? years ago.

This is more of a reflection on Tolkein than the movie per se, but I love the strong female characters.  Considering that when he was writing women were still predominantly in traditional roles, I give him a lot of credit for having female characters that actually participate and do something!  I definitely loved the ""show down"" with the Witch King.

I hate lord of the rings, but overall its not that bad. its just a basic struggle between good and evil set in a fantasy medieval relm; Where the main ubjective is to destroy an object that will lead to the weakening or destruction of the ultimate evil. Its a plot used in many stories, but one unique thing that Tolkien does in LotR is that while writting about hte main characters quest to destroy the item he also talkes about other people in the world and their struggle to fight the ultimate evil in their own ways, such as wagging oper war upon it or setting up decoys to help the main characters travel safer. Tolkien has laidened his work with countless allusions and symbolism which allows for a deeper meaning throughout the story and gives backstory to many characters, be they magor, main, or even obscurley minor characters that only say 3 words befor they go riding off to battle and die on the next page.

7273927,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Few movie experiences have been as sublime or heartrending as the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which began with the forming of a Fellowship and grew with the battle against the Two Towers.

And in ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,"" Peter Jackson brings JRR Tolkien's epic fantasy to its powerful, heartbreaking close. While the ending is notoriously gradual to unfold -- not surprising in a story this long and complicated -- it's a glorious experience that can only end in beauty, sorrow and the ultimate battle between good and evil.

Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still following the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the path to Mordor, with Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realizes his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel to get Frodo back.

Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. Not only is the city under siege, but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his one remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the joined forces of Gondor and Rohan will not be enough to stop Sauron unless Frodo destroys the Ring -- and with his mind being worn away by its evil, he might not be able to.

The ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess.

Peter Jackson manages to craft a genuine sense that this is an epic story -- the scope of the story grows even larger when Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith, especially when we see the sweeping grandeur of the signal fires. And of course, he sweeps through a series of increasingly explosive battle scenes (involving oliphaunts, Black Riders and glow-in-the-dark ghosts). Each action scene a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't.

But if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. They cry, they hug, they think about home -- such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into equally rich movie dialogue.

Elijah Wood gives an unparalleled performance as Frodo Baggins. Frodo's gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the ""strong"" unbowed hobbit, rather than the follower (""I can't carry it for you... but I can carry you!""). The final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated.

But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, as both younger hobbits are forced to deal with the horrors of war. Ian McKellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom, and Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto as the despairing Eowyn and David Wenham as the noble, kindly Faramir all give amazing performances. And of course, the titular king is Mortensen's Aragorn, now faced with the ultimate challenges -- and possibly the ultimate sacrifices -- that will decide whether he falls or triumphs over Sauron.

Perhaps the most striking thing about ""Return of the King"" is the final fourth of the film. While the ""multiple endings"" may annoy some viewers, it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden, splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending, Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron.

""Return of the King"" brings the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy to a close, and cements Jackson's reputation as a master filmmaker. With the outstanding cast, beautiful scripting and amazing direction, this is a fitting capstone to the trilogy.",1310601600,14,4837,4.931203931203931
7273928,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Frodo (Elijah Wood), Gollum (Andy Serkis) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) are almost near Mount Doom where they are destined to destroy the one ring. Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) with Aragon (Viggo Morganstein), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (Jonathan Rhys Davis) are heading off to Minas Tirith which is the capital of Gondor to aid the humans who are in war with the Orcs, demons and bad warriors in Mordor who are at war with humans. Merry (Billy Boyd) and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan) both help out with our other heroes to battle against Sauron's minions in the ultimate battle between good and evil, can Aragon become King as he was destined and will there be hope that Frodo successfully destroys the ring or will it take hold of him?

An awesome finale to the groundbreaking Lord of the Rings trilogy, Peter Jackson and company hands down were faithful to Tolkein's book in every way. Co-starring Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm, Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, Cate Blancett, Karl Urban and John Nobel this is a smashing epic 3 hour finale of the trilogy. Ranking up there with 3 hour epics like ""Gone with the wind"", ""Doctor Zhavigo"", ""Ben-Hur"", ""Titanic"" or whatever showing what true cinematic genius this third installment of a major trilogy can stand up to the first two much like ""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade"", ""Return of the Jedi"", ""Toy Story 3"" or whatever third installment. Flawless acting, amazing visual effects by WETA, solid storytelling, multiple endings, emotion, a rousing score by Howard Shore and bloody epic action sequences galore made this a true movie that earned it's cinematic history like the last 2 movies and deservedly earned it's oscar for best picture and 13 awards.

Packed with strong emotional moments as well as visually impressive action sequences, this movie stands out from the pack. People argue that this movie is too long but its so good that i don't think it should matter that its kind of long. Buy it, watch it, enjoy it!!!",1299888000,,339,4.230769230769231
7273934,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"I just don't get how anyone can really deeply invest themselves in a world of imagination with such a somber outlook on what was supposed to be a tale of adventure.  When I read Tolkien's works there was an heir of mythology, adventure, some serious overtones of international conflict in a fantasy world, but nothing profound as such.  And yet the films, and specifically this film, treat Tolkien's tales with a kind of heavy-handedness that I think only holds back a better movie.

Don't get me wrong, it's respectable entertainment, and being a fan of sword play on the screen I truly do enjoy what has been presented.  But I just can't get into a serious vein of ""what if"" kind of mindset.  The kind of framework that a young boy's mind would create is what's needed, but this film doesn't even placate to the inner child, so much as it holds the inner child in an adult esteem.  That is consider the classic ""The Night Before Christmas"" poem.  If we were to bring it to life via a film we would not lose it's heir of whimsy.  We would not alter the mood to cater to the adults who were watching the film, so much as we would create a film that catered to the story, which itself is supposed to be appealing for what it is.

But yet we have a sprawling adventure saga that's been given a tremendous amount of what Woody Allen calls' ""heviosity"".  Everyone is bent on going through deep emotional turmoil to bring about an end to a war that is a little murky regarding its causes and sources of conflict.  Truth be told the causes for the war are supernatural, and we get a hint of that, but more or less we're sold a bill of goods in terms of being presented the reality of the war and how to end it, not so much what caused it in the first place.  Such stories are children's fare, but the film doesn't really cater to children, so much as the adult child.

And I guess that's why I don't get into these films, nor hold them in any real high esteem.  They'e not Kurosawa's ""RAN"" with some fantasy flavoring sprinkled in here and there.  No.  They are truly films meant for a child like mindset, but geared for an adult.  I think of stuff I like, and I do have a number of guilty pleasures that, as an adult, I can enjoy on a child's level.  But films like ""Return of the King"" try to sell us more on the conflict than delving into the human heart by refraining from too much emotional overplay.

The Lord of the Ring's series are big films with lots of artistry, logistics and organizational achievements the likes of which we'll probably never see again, and have not seen since Elizabeth Taylor's ""Cleopatra"".  But for all that, they are, after all, just movies.

Me, I would have preferred something a little less serious but not too light hearted.  I would have preferred goblins as Tolkien described, not overplayed like Jackson's film.  Ditto with all the other creatures and beings populating Tolkien's realm.  But, again, having made those remarks I do have to admit that I enjoy them for what they are, and I can't think of any other film maker with as much energy or passion for the material as someone like a Peter Jackson to bring Tolkien's world to life.

In this regard I will call Pete Jackson the TRUE lord of the rings for our time.",1299801600,,3254,4.392320534223706
7273935,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This movie is no ordinary movie - it is a filmmaking achievement of the highest order.  Even if you don't like fantasy stories (and I'm not a huge fan of the genre), you will be drawn into the story of this film.  Never mind the CGI and special effects - you'll forget that it's fiction, because the human struggles at the center of this story are so real and relevant for all times that you'll be moved, as I was, to tears during this movie.  The story presents the familiar clash of good vs. evil, with kingdoms pitted against one another, striving for power - but the director here is so skilled, that the focus remains on the characters and what drives them.  The choices they make determine the destiny of the world, and ultimately they are the ones who decide whether the world will be engulfed in evil and death, or redeemed through faith and courage.

The central storyline involves the journey of two Hobbits, Frodo and Samwise.  Frodo is tasked with carrying the One Ring, a tool that was forged by a great evil and has only the power to destroy; however, its master will be the ruler of the world, although the world will be engulfed in death and destruction.  No one is able to resist the dangerous power of the One Ring, and therefore Frodo must carry the ring to Mount Doom (an active volcano), where it was forged, and the only place where it can be destroyed.  Frodo's temptation to secure the ring for himself, which is compounded by his physical deterioration, and forced flight from enemies who are seeking the ring for themselves, drive the story.  Frodo's humble friend and servant Samwise accompanies him on the journey.  Sean Astin, the actor who plays Samwise, should have been nominated for the Oscar - he's that good.  We learn by the end of the movie that Samwise has the heart of a lion.  He keeps his master Frodo on task, as any good servant does, but his willingness to risk all to fight for goodness in his small slice of the world, has ramifications for the entire world.

Another character-driven storyline involves Aragorn, the unacknowledged heir to the Kingdom of Gondor.  Aragorn as the rightful heir could command great armies (including a supernatural army) in the fight against evil, but he is hindered by the weight of generational failures.  He will have to make a choice to assume his true identity and risk repeating the failure, or live out his life in anonymity as an unknown warrior.

The director (Peter Jackson) is immensely talented and tells the story in epic fashion, without sacrificing plausibility, or sympathy for the characters.  He puts many of his fellow directors to shame, even the most gifted of his contemporaries (such as Ridley Scott, whose forays into action-and-adventure are top of the line - Alien, Gladiator - but pale in comparison to this film).

The acting is first-rate.  Sean Astin, as Samwise, gives the performance of a lifetime (although you hope he continues to be given blockbuster material in the future).  Viggo Mortensen is perfectly cast as Aragorn, the reluctant King whose ambivalence about his destiny doesn't come off as wishy-washy or cowardly, although it might have in the hands of a lesser actor.  Miranda Otto is very sympathetic as Eowyn, a warrior princess who is the fulfillment of a prophecy in the film.  David Wenham shows his depth as Faramir, the cast-aside younger son of the delusional Steward of Gondor, who sends his own son to certain death on a suicide mission.  Such tangential storylines involving supporting characters make the film come alive, rather than detracting from the story (a tribute to the film's director) and give the uniformly excellent cast robust material to chew on.

I loved this movie.  I'm not a fan of the original material (J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy), which I found to be slow-moving and unfocused.  If you love great filmmaking and love great stories about why it's important to stand up to evil, this rare film is for you.",1299369600,,3976,4.751091703056769

7273951,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The three *The Lord of the Rings* films [all directed by Peter Jackson] have clearly made film history, chiefly due to their marked overall excellence. This film trilogy, shot entirely in New Zealand, is breathtaking at a minimum. Here, I'm reviewing the *Special Extended Edition* [as opposed to the much shorter Theatrical Version] of the third of these films on DVD, *The Return of the King*. It concludes the larger story on all fronts.

I'm sure that the tale is familiar to most who would show an interest in this film but, for the uninitiated, the overall adult fantasy trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien chronicles a group of Middle Earth travelers which include a wizard, two men, a dwarf, an elf, and four hobbits, ergo: ""The Fellowship"". They are set upon this quest because two evil wizards have joined forces in an effort to eventually conquer and enslave all otherwise peaceful cultures of Middle Earth which includes Hobbits, Men, and Elves. At the behest of the pair of dark and nefarious sorcerers are the most dreadful orcs, trolls, wargs, and other heinous minions.

At the outset [in previous films], one of the Hobbits [Frodo Baggins] has inherited a magic ring from an aged relative [Bilbo Baggins, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hobbit-70th-Anniversary-Edition-or-There-and-Back-Again/dp/0261103288/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hobbit: 70th Anniversary Edition: or There and Back Again</a>&nbsp;fame, a fantasy written by Tolkien for young people] and it eventually becomes clear that this is *The One Ring* which exerts full power over all remaining magic rings of power which still exist within Middle Earth. The One Ring was originally crafted by The Dark Lord [Sauron, the more powerful of the two evil wizards] but it was inadvertently lost for many years. As The One Ring [which can render one invisible, with certain negative caveats] ultimately ends up in the hands of Frodo, it becomes his crusade and his burden (along with the rest of The Fellowship) to destroy this ring at Mount Doom, a huge volcano which lies within Sauron's sinister and well-patrolled realm of Mordor.

*The Return of the King* picks up the story after The Fellowship has endured numerous battles and other notable impediments to their objective. At this point, The Fellowship has broken up into multiple segments and all but the Hobbit Frodo and his devoted companion, Sam, band together again in a final effort to divert Sauron's attention from The One Ring so that the two Hobbits can surreptiously enter Mordor and destroy it. Two spectacular battles ensue and the action is non-stop.

The advantage to viewing this edition of the film [as opposed to the theatrical version] is that the story makes a lot more sense, especially to those folks who have not read the books, (now available in a single edition:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-50th-Anniversary-One-Vol-Edition/dp/0618640150/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings: 50th Anniversary, One Vol. Edition</a>.) This DVD is significantly longer than the theatrical version.

The trio of films broke tons of of new ground which was particularly in evidence as the cast and crew made a clean sweep at the Academy Awards for this final entry in the year of its release. The special effects were so sigificantly on the cutting edge of technology [chiefly enhanced by WETA Digital in New Zealand] that each film became superior to its prequel. *The Return of the Kings* stands today as the very hallmark of special effects technology -- it's so superb because all the characters and scenery look so realistic. No detail or necessary expense was spared in the making of this epic film.

Howard Shore continued to write music for this movie which has helped to place it in such high esteem. His filmscore [available in its entirety here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Return-of-the-King-The-Complete-Recordings/dp/B000V6BE6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (The Complete Recordings)</a>], coupled with segments of the soundtracks of the two previous films, are now available as a *Lord of the Rings Concert* such as this one&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Music-from-The-Lord-of-the-Rings-Trilogy/dp/B0002ABTM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Music from The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</a>, these being rendered by various renowned orchestras around the globe. Some arrangements of this music vary, depending upon the conductor and the orchestra. Shore used The London Philharmonic for the movie soundtrack.

This film stands on its own. You could definitely watch and enjoy it without having seen the two previous films. But I would heartily recommend that you do view the other two in the order in which they were released:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Fellowship-of-the-Ring-Platinum-Series-Special-Extended-Edition/dp/B000067DNF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Two-Towers-Platinum-Series-Special-Extended-Edition/dp/B00009TB5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>.

While it was likely that Frodo [Elijah Wood] was the central character in the film, or perhaps even Gandalf the Wizard [Sir Ian McKellan], it is the stellar performance of Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn which eclipses them all. Still, this film is perfectly cast and that was clearly half the battle for Director Peter Jackson.

As with the preceding two Special Extended Edition DVD sets, this boxed set includes two *Appendices* discs [four discs total, two for the film and the two ""making of"" discs] which cover every possible aspect of the making of the movie. They are infinitely well-done and are nearly as compelling as the movie itself.

Do not miss this historic and magnificent film, even if fantasy is not precisely your favorite genre. Highly recommended above all others!

Since blu-ray tech came well after the release of the DVD special extended edition release (250 Min), one would think Peter Jackson would only re-release the superior special extended version in the stead of the theatrical edition? Bottom line, he didn't. So why would Mr. Jackson make this release of the shorter version instead? Well to fool those consumers who would think that the blu-ray would naturally have the extended version. Thus those foolish costumers (my hand risen, as one of them) will end up buying both versions, Theatrical and the more aparently impending to be later re-released Special Extended, separately on blu-ray... pretty ef'ed up, but true.

7273969,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of ""Lord of the Rings"" reaches its pinnacle in ""Return of the King."" The stellar cast, mind-blowing special effects and heartbreaking script are all present in the third movie, which is not only the last of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, but the best -- and it's a shame that this blu-ray only includes the theatrical version.

Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still following the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the path to Mordor, with the increasingly strained Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realizes his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel...

Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. The city is under siege, and the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the dead won't help him if Frodo doesn't destroy the Ring...

The ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess.

Peter Jackson really outdoes himself. You know those battle scenes in ""Two Towers"" and ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" with the swooping camera and thousands of orcs, clashing with men on a gloomy battlefield? In ""Return of the King,"" Jackson surpasses that. There's everything from volcanic eruptions to an invasion of howling ghosts to the attack of the oliphaunts (like elephants, only bigger). Each action scene a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't.

But if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. They cry, they hug, they think about home -- such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into equally rich movie dialogue.

Elijah Wood gives an unparalleled performance as Frodo Baggins. Frodo's gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the ""strong"" hobbit, rather than the follower. The final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated.

But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, and the ""I'm going to take care of you"" scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Mortensen gets more kingly every moment, while Ian McKellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom. Bernard Hill has a quietly moving final scene, while Miranda Otto makes the despairing Eowyn a strong, kick-butt heroine.

And for this blu-ray? For some insane reason, The Powers That Be just WILL NOT release the extended edition of this movie, even after all these years -- meaning that a giant chunk of the narrative is missing. Yes, it's the theatrical release... yet AGAIN. And the extras are from the theatrical version as well: spots, previews, featurettes, trailers, and some documentaries about making the movies.

""Return of the King"" brings the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy to a close, and cements Jackson's reputation as a master filmmaker. But this edition only tells half the story, so you might want to hang tight for the extended blu-ray.",1277596800,4,4332,5.039106145251397

However, as happens so often when trying to take a story of this magnitude and put it on the silver screen, I was afraid that the movie would fall short of the expectation.  I'm happy to say the movie exceeded the expectation.  And while some would say the original was too long, all I could say was give me more.  The extended versions fulfill that request.

If you loved the books and have read them 1,2,10,15,50 times you might have been a bit dissapointed by the theatrical version of the movie where whole parts of the book were ""missing"".
This version however is a full one. Even for those who are not familiar with the books and are only fans of the motion picture this version makes much more sense, fills you up with the details just as the books did.
There are scenes here that for some fans are just crucial to the story... Not mentioning the other DVD's in this set with all the extra features( making of etc).
The only downfall of this DVD set is the fact that the feature itself is placed upon 2 disc, but this is a minor issue that is quickly overcome by the vastness of the story, effects, acting and the lot.
Highly recommended for any true fan of Tolkien and anyone who feels that there is more to LOTR than that what we were shown in the theatres when it came out.
GREAT buy, you won't regret getting it.
Another fantastic thing about it? Its price...
Compare to what it was sold for a few years back( when it originally came out) you save a bit of cash and it is almost impossible to get it elsewhere.

The members of the fellowship in Rohan are warned of the impending attack when Pippin cannot resist looking into Saruman's palantir and is briefly contacted by the dark lord. King Theoden is too proud to send his men to help without being asked, so Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to see that this request is sent. They meet opposition there from Denethor, steward of the city and father of Faramir and the late Boromir. Denethor's family has acted as temporary guardians of Gondor for centuries until a member of the true line of kings returns. This member is none other than Aragorn, who must overcome his own self-doubt before he can take on the role he was destined to fulfill. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam continue to carry the One Ring towards Mordor, guided by Gollum. What they don't know is that Gollum is leading them into a trap so that he can reclaim the Ring for himself. Though Sam suspects his deceit, Frodo is starting to be corrupted by the Ring's power and the mistrust of Sam this causes is fully exploited by Gollum. The only way good can prevail in this contest is if the Ring is destroyed, an event that is becoming harder every minute for Frodo to achieve. The fate of every living creature in Middle Earth will be decided once and for all as the Quest of the Ringbearer reaches its climax.

I find it hard to critique this one as I find no faults with it at all, until we get to the end, where it does drag a little but that's an otherwise small complaint for an otherwise flawless film. Action sequences are the best of the three; the Battle of Pelennor Fields being the highlight and Sam's moment of fighting Shelob as a brilliant moment of the character showing his loyalty to his friend.

NEVER before opened, everything was brand-spankin'-new, no dings, no corners bent and the extended edition of this film is the ONLY way to see this movie. There's a Blu-Ray edition coming out of these movies & I knew that before purchasing this Extended edition of the 3rd installment of the series. However, the blu-rays are the theatrical releases only & the extended edition blu-ray comes out way later, so I opted to purchase this in DVD. This Extended Edition is more thrilling, 50 minutes (almost an entire HOUR)of extra film added to the viewing experience seamlessly integrated into the whole film.....a gazillion hours of extras-bonuses-goodies. An Extended Edition on DVD is far superior than a stinkin' Blu-Ray THEATRICAL release, hands down. Get this extended on DVD to hold you over 'til Blu-Ray Extended Edition packaged with better stuff, then it'll be PERFECT.

7274016,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"When the DVD arrived earlier than expected, I was taken aback. My previous extended edition of ""LotR: Return of the King"" had been a box set with four DVD's (at least before my apartment building burned down). This DVD was a bit thicker than the standard DVD case and only had 2 discs.

I then saw that the movie was on a two-side disc and I was even more skeptical. I was only used to seeing ""classics"" on two-sided DVD's --  you know, the ""classic"" science fiction, horror and action movies you find in the dollar store for $2 each or 3-for-$5.

But, I watched the movie and it was in excellent condition (which was good since it was still in the cellophane wrapping). I did have to flip the DVD over, but that was no big deal because, with the previous boxed set, I had to switch discs anyway.

The DVD arrived in a very timely manner (at about the middle of the 14-day delivery window, not at the proverbial 14th day). So, my fears of inferior service assuaged, I was able to sit back and give a much more level-headed review.

The acting is outstanding and beautiful,as the hopeless mission to Mount Doom and the battle of Minas Tirith are brought near flawlessly from page to screen. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin portray Frodo and Sam with emotion and you feel as if they really are the characters. Another to look out for is Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn,who portrays him with power and presence,and I really was stunned he did not win an Oscar for his performance. The supporting cast is well used,particularly John Noble as the tragic,but deranged,Denethor. The score is sweeping and epic,fitting the battle sequences as well as the Journey to Mount Doom. The added sequences are great,among the best are the Mouth of Sauron sequence,and Saruman's demise. Several scenes are added to the battles and Stairs of Cirith Ungol sequence. I hope that if they re-release this film they will use this extended edition,because I beleive this is the best version of the,in my opinion,best film ever made. Not for nothing did this film win 11 oscars. If you want an epic,complex,extremly moving,powerful study of courage and friendship,love and death,this is the film you want.

At Rohan, Pippin sees in the Palantir that Sauron wants to strike at Minas Tirith. Gandalf and Pippin travel there to warn them.

7274034,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"As the third and final installment in Peter Jackson's directorial magnum opus, The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is a must-have title--if you already own the other two. Like its predecessors, it is a very long film that could easily be shortened by 45 minutes to an hour without losing anything from the plot. Yes, it's a visually stunning interpretation of a classic piece of 20th century literature, and it deserved the 11 Oscars it won, including best picture, but at almost THREE AND A HALF HOURS it's just too darned long. I mean, just how many monster battles does one need to sit through to get the point? If you're totally into that kind of thing, then this is your all-you-can-eat buffet. For me, the best thing about having it on DVD is the pause button, because you can periodically get up to relieve yourself, of fix a snack, or even have a life while watching it. Taking the thing in at a single sitting isn't just a pastime, it's a commitment.

Of course, we haven't even mentioned the second disc containing several hours of bonus features yet. They're great, by the way, and there's a lot of them. One thing that can definitely be said for this package is that if you like the content, you more than get your money's worth.

Amazingly, there is actually an extended version of this film available that has a running time of more than four hours!!! Now that's the epitome overkill, both literally and figuratively.",1219363200,,1437,4.587548638132295
7274035,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Ambitious in vision, epic in scope, and beautiful in execution, Peter Jackson's ""Return of the King"" is a fitting end to his adaptation of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy that is a magnum opus if there ever was one.  Everything that you loved about the first two movies are here--if you didn't love or see the first two, don't bother with this, because it's literally the direct continuation--though things in this one take all of that to the next level.  While the first two movies were entertaining and told great stories, they were largely build-up for the various climaxes that redefine the term ""catharsis"" of this movie.

Jackson does a stellar job in adapting these acclaimed books into what may be the best fantasy trilogy of all time, ending it as nicely as he begun it.  The level of quality remains consistent throughout, and the level of attention given to each battle, each character moment, each bit of score (which, alone, was tragically beautiful), and each special effect is commendable.  Not only did Jackson do a great job of translating the book to work as a film, he also showed a large amount of bravery while doing so.  Many lovers of the book might have been disappointed with how Jackson tampered with the structure of the book (leaving out how Saruman took out The Shire in the book version, as well as restructuring Frodo, Sam, and Gollum's journey, moving the Shelob build-up and conflict to this movie instead of keeping it as a part of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Two-Towers/dp/B00005JKZV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Two Towers</a>, but for me that just showed that he was willing to change a coupe of things to make this the best movie as it could possibly be--and his efforts paid off in large, large ways.

Though I'm giving this movie a 10/10 because it is indeed a classic and deserves full marks, it's not perfect.  No movie is.  I thought that the ending employed too many fade-to-whites and fade outs, which tricked the audience many times over, making them think it was about to end.  If Jackson had just used cuts instead of fades, it would have been fine, but when he faded for the third time and the movie still didn't end, I find that most people who haven't seen it before actually laugh--and that certainly isn't what the end of the movie should do.  The battle scenes are a bit drawn out, especially the scenes before Aragorn and the army of the dead arrive.  Jackson could have achieved a more powerful effect if he trimmed two or three minutes off of the war scenes.

All it all, it's as perfect a fantasy film as there is out there, and highly deserves all the acclaim it's gotten.  ""The Return of the King"" is a fitting end to one of the best stories ever told, and--despite it's length--it has high rewatchability.

There simply isn't enough good things one could say about  Frodo and company, a landmark ending to an unforgettable saga that only gets better with repeated viewings.

7274041,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Fans of film and fantasy have had the pleasure of seeing one of the all time classic tales brought forth from the page to the screen. The story of first Bilbo and then Frodo Baggins has captured the imagination of readers for years now. But the translation to screen was slow in coming. An animated version directed by Ralph Bakshi came out in the seventies and was not adopted by the fans. Until Peter Jackson took the bull by the reigns and turned this unfilmable project into the mega success it was, it looked like all hope was lost.

And now, the final chapter in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy arrives. The wait was more than worth it. The story of a ring of power that had to be destroyed started with THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, where a group of beings from Middle Earth joined together to accomplish this task. THE TWO TOWERS took us further down that same journey, featuring the tremendous battle of Helm's Deep. THE RETURN OF THE KING takes what was best of both previous films and pulls it all together.

The story picks up with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) still making the dangerous trek to Mordor in an attempt to destroy the ring of power and save Middle Earth. Still in their company is Gollum (Andy Sirkis), longing to possess the ring once more and plotting against the pair as they near their destination.

The other members of the Fellowship have now reached the fallen tower of Saruman The White (Christopher Lee) and found Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). In counsel with Theoden (Bernard Hill), Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellan) and Aragorn (Vigo Mortensen) warn of the coming danger. Finding an orb that connects Merry to the evil Sauron, Gandalf and Merry travel to Minas Trith to warn of the danger and organize an army to protect the rest of Middle Earth from the oncoming attacks of Sauron and his legions of orcs. Instead they find the steward of Minas Trith refusing to surrender the throne to the true king, Aragorn.

The rest of the Fellowship wait for a sign from Minas Trith which comes but perhaps too late as the legions of Sauron are upon them. As they prepare for battle, Aragorn leaves them in an attempt to round up more warriors since they are currently outnumbered. The ghosts of fallen defenders of the crown are called upon to pay off the oath they took to do so.

All of the pieces are placed on the board and we watch as the battle of Minas Trith begins. It is an amazing sight to see as creatures that cannot exist ridden by other creatures that cannot be attack. Flying dragons ridden by frightful leaders, orcs in battle gear raging against the walls of Minas Trith and mobile towers set to allow easy access to the walled city are brought forth and made believable.

All the while, Frodo, Sam and Gollum are nearing the dark lands. The treachery of Gollum is seen by Sam but Frodo continues to defend him, putting the trio at peril. It isn't until near the films end that what it intends for Frodo is revealed.

All of these stories meld into one another easily, creating a tale that is not near as complicated to follow as one would think. The storytelling done here makes it seem real, pulls the viewer into the action and makes you care about each and every character. Even side characters are developed enough that you worry about the outcome of each one.

To reveal the end would be more than just offering a spoiler to readers. The fact is that not everyone comes home by films end. Heroes are revealed, romances are fulfilled and the journey DOES end, sad but true. And it does so with style.

While the two previous films have been overlooked at award ceremonies, to do so now would simply be spiteful in the face of its success. This movie delivers what all have waited for and expected.

As I watched form beginning to end, I felt the same feeling that came over me as I watched the earlier films. We live in a world where heroes are torn down on a daily basis. The good deeds done by those we were brought up to respect are overlooked in an effort by one group or another trying to push forth their own agenda by making them look bad. Take Thomas Jefferson for example. All of his accomplishments have been overlooked in favor of his having a slave as a mistress. This is how we treat heroes today.

But not in fiction, or at least some of it. The lessons of life, the unwanted but sometimes unavoidable task at hand of going to battle, sacrificing oneself for the good of the rest, attempting to actually achieve something without the playing field made level, all of these are depicted in this story. Admiration for these characters, people who find their destinies linked, who have to do all that they can to save their way of life, is felt from the first frame to the last.

Epic films of the past have marveled audiences for decades. The chariot race from BEN-HUR, the desert sands from LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, the demolition of the bridge in BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, have been used to mark film history in both quality and esteem. It is time that these films received the recognition that they deserve as well.

In my 50 years on Earth, I have seen tons of movies. Rarely have I had the chance to see a movie, no a series of movies, that have captured my imagination so well. No time have I seen a series of films (including STAR WARS) that have made me long for the next chapter. These movies are made to be seen on a big screen. Thank goodness big screen TVs have arrived in the nick of time.",1205539200,,5500,4.449851042701092
7274042,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Rare is the movie that one can say has everything.  Hollywood used to produce these during the 1960's; classics like Ben-Hur, Cleopatra, Spartacus, and The Ten Commandments.  But even these pale to the 4.5 hour epic that is Return of the King.  The latter has everything; comedy, romance, action, suspense, drama, a great soundtrack, incredible cinematography, unrivaled special effects, a grand cast, and of course; a happy ending.  Unlike other epic movies, this one contains numerous scenes that are of a  climactic quality; whether it be the Ring's destruction; the triumphant charge of the Rohirrim on Pelennor Fields, the lighting of the torches from Gondor to Rohan, or even Faramir's charge at the behest of his father.  The entire movie makes for an incredible emotional roller coaster.  And unlike its two predecessors; this one did get Best Picture, along with 10 other Oscars; all of which were well deserved.

Now that I have heaped the praise, lets point out what could have been improved.  First and foremost; for the length of the movie; it leaves out a lot of important material from the book.  Better for the story and for the critics to include everything from the book, and brake it up into two separate movies.  Conclude the first one with the death of Theoden, and include Sharky's (Saruman) conquest of the shire.

A second letdown was Faramir's defense of Osgiliath during the invasion of Sauron's army.  It was portrayed very poorly.  From the Fellowship of the Ring up to this point, one gets the feeling that Boromir was the swordsman who preferred intimate conflict while Faramir was the archer who'd rather act from afar.  Yet when Faramir prepares his men to repel the Orc amphibious invasion, he has his men take up swords and fight on ground level.  A more appropriate defense would be for the men to take refuge on the rooftops and decimate the invading orcs with arrows; nearly all the Gondorian soldiers had bows and arrows.  They would have lasted a lot longer, and might have even repulsed the invasion.

The third major failing was Aragorn's triumphant entry onto Pelennor Fields with the Army of the Dead.  It seems as if the orcs just line up to be killed by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.  This contrasts greatly with every previous battle scene where the orcs are quite vicious and skilled in combat.

But for all its failings, this is probably the best movie released this decade; and by far the best movie to be directed by a non-American.  My favorite part of this movie was its soundtrack.  It is quite rare for an action movie to have memorable singing parts; this one had two.  The first is by Merry in probably the most haunting scene of the movie.  The second is by Aragorn on his coronation.  Legend has it that both actors came up with the music themselves; a proud achievement for both of them if true.

And it's of tempting to weep as the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy draws to a close, with the ""Return of the King."" Peter Jackson's brilliant adaptation ends the classic fantasy epic with a bang... but then quiets down to let us bid farewell to these lovable characters. Astounding direction, action, and a little pang when it's all over.

Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still following the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the path to Mordor, with the increasingly strained Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realizes his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel on his own.

Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. \Not only is the city under siege, but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his one remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the dead won't help him if Frodo doesn't destroy the Ring -- and its power over him is growing.

The ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess.

And in this movie, Peter Jackson really outdoes himself. You know those battle scenes in ""Two Towers"" and ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" with the swooping camera and thousands of orcs, clashing with men on a gloomy battlefield? In ""Return of the King,"" Jackson surpasses that. There's everything from volcanic eruptions to an invasion of howling ghosts to the attack of the oliphaunts (like elephants, only bigger). Each action scene is a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't.

But if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other, such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into rich movie dialogue.

Elijah Wood gives an unparalleled performance as Frodo Baggins -- it's hard to imagine any young actor in recent memory who has given a performance this wrenching. Frodo's deterioration is horrifying to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the ""strong"" hobbit, demonstrated in a tearjerking scene as they scale Mount Doom.

But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, and the ""I'm going to take care of you"" scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Mortensen and McKellen are astounding as the kingly outcast and the kick-butt wizard, while Miranda Otto, David Wenham and Bernard Hill are brilliant on the sidelines.

Perhaps the most striking thing about ""Return of the King"" is the final fourth of the film. While the ""multiple endings"" may annoy some viewers, it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden, splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending, Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron.

First thing I have to say, yes they left out the Sack of the Shire and much more material, but you know what, this is a 4-hour movie okay, if everybodies demand was met, this film would be six hours. When it comes to the quality of the movie for what it is, it's fantastic, great new sequences, that are great, excpt one......

The only bad sequence in this movie was The Mouth of Sauron, ""The Mouth"" is basically a demented human being whom Sauron has basically posessed and turned into his minion. Now the sketches for this creature (which they show you in the special features) looked great, on screen, they were a mess, so bad in fact that the whole sequence became a comedy. ""The Mouth"", in concept, is a being who is designed to look like an evil priest, he wears a large, veil-like helmet, that makes him look disturbing and sage-like. His mouth is slit open at parts and filled with rotting teeth. Now this sounds fantastic but on screen it's hysterical. His helmet is large and bulky, it looks so big that it appears he might fall off his steed at in moment. But the biggest flaw, was whenever he delivered a line, he tilted his head back and grinned, I don't know what was funny about this, but it was, probably because he through himself into his grin so much, he looked like he was a demented being trying to audition for Barney. If you watch the sequence for yourself, you'll know what I mean.

7274058,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"When I was in eighth grade (and had one of the most excellent English teachers ever), I was commissioned to write a review for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. That was probably one of the most passionate pieces of writing I have ever produced. Seeming that I have recently been playing Lord of the Rings computer games and reading fantasy material, I decided that it was time to return to Middle Earth and write a review for The Return of the King.

 Be forewarned, however. I am far from an experienced film critic, but I am a well-seasoned fanboy-especially for the works of Tolkien. He, along with C.S. Lewis, holds an almost idolatrous place in my heart. This does not make the task of reviewing this film any easier-quite the contrary. If I were writing a review for some dime-a-dozen comedy or drama or chick flick, I would be able to give my opinion easily and straightforwardly. There is no vested emotion in that. But my best friend and I had reserved our seats for this movie weeks in advance, at the first showing, on opening night. I had been visiting theonering.net for years, keeping up with the latest rumors and spoilers. I had posters with Gandalf and Balrogs on my wall, action figures of Aragorn on my dresser. I cannot give an unbiased (or even entirely rational) review of this movie. Just as the creators of this film produced this masterpiece for me, I feel obligated to provide a worthy tribute to their work. You have been warned.

 The Return of the King is the culmination of nearly a decade of work by one of the finest filmmaking teams ever assembled. At the helm was visionary director Peter Jackson, accompanied by screenwriters Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. WETA of New Zealand provided the visual effects under the artistic direction of Richard Taylor, and guided by the highly regarded Alan Lee and John Howe. New Line Cinema provided the financial support for the trilogy, without which this film never would have been produced (at least in the same form). New Line had quite a bit riding on this venture; their fiscal faith was the enabling factor that gave LotR the chance to be made the right way.

By this point-unless you've been living in a hobbit hole-you've probably seen the movie and know the plot. Just to refresh the memory, King revolves around two quests. Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) make their weary trek across Mordor with schizophrenic Gollum (voiced/motion captured by Andy Serkis) to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. Meanwhile, the men of Gondor and Rohan must hold off the armies of Mordor, allowing Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) to take his rightful place as king. The future king rides with elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and comic relief dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) to enlist the help of an undead army. King Theoden of Rohan leads Eomer (Karl Urban), Eowyn (Miranda Otto), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), and legions of cavalry to aid the faltering forces of Denethor (John Noble), steward of Gondor, and his son Faramir (David Wenham). Wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) alternates between directing Gondor defenses and keeping Pippin (Billy Boyd) out of trouble. This convoluted plot will no doubt prove daunting to viewers who have not read the books, but as one has seen the previous two installments in the trilogy, the interweaving storylines are manageable.

 The stellar acting which audiences enjoyed in the first two movies returns in King. As John Rhys-Davies commented in an interview, the casting for these movies was ""spot-on"". There's not a bad performance in the entire bunch, and only by entering the netherworld of nit-pickiness can real criticisms be made. Viggo Mortensen, while aptly portraying the humility and quiet strength that Aragon possesses in the books, never seems to truly step out and become the strong leader we expect him to be. Arwen (Liv Tyler), Aragorn's love interest, decides to give up her elven immortality to be his bride, but that sacrifice doesn't seem to elicit the emotion that such a choice should. Gimli seems to have been reduced from the gruff warrior he was in the first movie to the butt of the movie's jokes, although that probably reflect more on the screenplay than on Rhys-Davies' abilities. The screenplay may also have been a limiting factor in the portrayal of tragic Lord Denethor. John Noble endows the character with a brilliant touch of Shakespearean madness and fallen grace, but in the end simply does not give a convincing cause for his madness. Many people walk away from the movie asking ""what was with that guy that set himself on fire?""

 While it is difficult to find weak points in the performance of the cast, it is easy to pick the standout performances. Gandalf really comes into his own in this movie. When Gandalf the Grey underwent his resurrection in the second movie, I was a little disappointed with the slightly more two-dimensional Gandalf the White which replaced him. In The Fellowship of the Ring, Ian McKellen breathed such life into the wizard, and that life didn't seem to carry over quite as well into The Two Towers. Well, that life is back. Gandalf becomes the embodiment of the forces of good, a light in dark times. He commandeers the defense of Minas Tirith and commands the troops in a way that we wish Aragorn would emulate. He knows what is at stake, and that sense of urgency and importance is clear to the audience through his character. Another outstanding performance, one that surprised me a little, was Sam. The ""fat hobbit"" had done well as Frodo's protective defender figure, but he really comes into his own in King. We see that Sam is as much responsible for the success of the quest as Frodo is. Frodo calls him ""Samwise the Brave"" in Towers, and the hobbit (and actor) live up to that title magnificantly. I felt far more concern for him that I ever did for Frodo while I was watching the film. Andy Serkis builds on the success he had as Gollum in the last film and proves to the world that a computer-animated character can actually be a realistic figure in a film. He becomes a part of the story that Jar-Jar Binks from Star Wars and Dobby from Harry Potter can't even compare with. The animators have a lot to do with that (and we'll get to them in due time) but I believe much of the power of the wretched creature is inspired by Serkis's vocal performance and his work to capture Gollum's style of movement. He is hideous, awful, and worthy of falling into a volcano, but we can't help but feel some pity for the ruined life he has led because of the ring.

 The script and screenplay do a fine job of staying true to the spirit of the books while producing a film that would succeed in its own right. The dialogue is believable, fitting the setting and mood of the film well. While the story does seem to lag a little in the beginning, it picks up and gains epic momentum as it blasts to the mind-blowing conclusion. Obviously the enormous battle scenes are a major part of the film, but they are counterbalanced with quieter moments of character development and some tension-relieving comedy. Some departures from the book I could understand (like leaving out the scouring of the Shire and waiting until now to provide Aragorn with his sword Anduril); some I could not. I share Christopher Lee's outrage at having his last scene as Saruman cut from the theatrical version (although the performance is preserved in the extended edition DVD). Aragorn's actions in the House of Healing were sorely missed. And why in Middle-Earth did they make Barad-dur a lighthouse, complete with Sauron as a giant fiery flashlight on top? Despite these purist gripes, Jackson and company are overall successful in their choices of what to include and what to discard. Tolkien was more linguist than novelist anyways, and his story-no matter how grand-needed some editing to become a workable plot. There's plenty of fanservice in the film anyways, from clever wordplay with Aragorn's name (""Hope"" in Elvish) to the final scene, which is straight from the book. Don't worry though: a non-nerd will still be able to appreciate the excellent story and powerful theatrics.

 The special effects in this movie are, to be succinct, unparalleled. The Star Wars junkies of the world would argue with that, but I challenge them to compare Jar-Jar or (dare I say it?) even Master Yoda to the realistic appearance of Gollum. There's no comparison. I was especially impressed with the buildings and set pieces. WETA designers built scale models of locales like Minas Tirith and Orthanc in order to give the places an added sense of realism that isn't fully achievable with CGI alone. Some of these `miniatures' were dozens of feet tall (earning the name of bigatures from the production staff), and thus the artists were able to put acute details into these models. The effort shows on film. All of the settings (particularly the White City) are outstanding. When CGI was used in the movie, it is mind-blowing. The Battle of Pelennor Fields with its tens of thousands of orcs, trolls, wargs, Rohirrim, dragon-like Fell Beasts, and towering war elephants is too much to take in. The encounter Frodo and Sam have with Shelob shows what live-action acting/CGI monster encounters should be in all movies. That arachnid will give you nightmares. I may have some minor gripes about specific shots (that shot with Smeagol's friend floating through the water made me wince), but it is still my opinion that the special effects of this film have yet to be paralleled-even now in 2006.

 The costumes/props of this production reflect the fetish with detail the miniature designers and CGI artists had. Nothing in this film looks fake - period. That's because the costume designers, blacksmiths, and other artists didn't cut corners. That sword which Elrond gives Aragorn? It's real steel, foraged much like a king's sword would have been in the late Middle Ages. The weapons are intricately inlaid with runes (which actually mean things in the various Elven languages). King Theoden's armor is fully functional, and is inlaid with a golden horse head-inside the breastplate, where no camera will ever see it. Everything from Gandalf's staff to Eoywn's dress looks absolutely gorgeous. Jackson told the team at WETA before they started production that he didn't want fantasy. He wanted history: something that someone might conceivably see in the Smithsonian. That's the feeling you get from looking at the costumes and armor and weapons in this film: each seems to be a product of distinct cultures, developed over hundreds of years. The Gondorians seem almost Roman with their standardized silver armor and stone cities. The Rohirrim are remenicient of the Celts or other Norsemen, having horses integrated into their architecture, clothing, and weapons. The bottom line is that it not only outstanding, but also believable.
With the completion of this trilogy's score, Howard Shore has placed his name up there with the likes of John Williams and other composers of the ages. I am continually impressed with how well the music in these films reflects the drama unfolding onscreen. Just as the arms and armor of the different races have distinct design and ornamentation, the musical motifs of Shore's score make each of the different groups memorable. Rohan's theme is back, with the Hardanger fiddle evoking rustic connotations well suited to the race. Mordor's blaring, tension-drenched theme is just as frightening and just as appropriate as it was in the first two films. Shelob's musical theme, with its high, rapid strings is strongly reminiscent of horror films, and heightens the danger on screen. But what takes the cake is the Gondor theme, at least in my opinion. Its bold brass and excellent crescendos is one of the things that really gives Minas Tirith and the race of men their majesty. This is a worthy foe for the forces of Mordor; the music gives it almost as much grandeur as the special effects.

 I may be biased, but I am not alone in my praise of Return of the King. IGN.com recently placed Lord of the Rings as number three best movie franchise of all time, and Return of the King is widely regarded as the pinnacle of the series, the grand finale of the project. It is by no means perfect, even by the standards of rabid fans, but no one could have asked for more. The Return of the King is a grand tribute to Tolkien, a triumph of fantasy as a genre, and a film that will be enjoyed for generations to come.",1194912000,,12501,4.806976744186047
7274059,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I don't know how else to contact Amazon to correct a huge problem in regard to the LOTR films, but they BADLY need to separate the reviews on the various editions of these films (e.g., the widescreen, the full-screen, and the Special Extended Edition version).

The Special Extended Editions are BY FAR the superior choices for anyone wishing to watch these great films and they're well-worth the money, but a LOT of folks don't know about them. With the additional footage, the movies make infinitely more sense, especially to anyone who has never previously read the Trilogy. All three LOTRs films are available in this format, plus, each film is on two discs, due to the added footage. In addition to that, each one is presented in a nice cardboard case, has an informational booklet included, and offers two ADDITIONAL discs which are ""special features"" sort of information. This is essentially a ""collectors' edition"" but, as I have mentioned, the movie itself (for more casual viewers as well as for fans) greatly benefits from the additional film footage.

So, since once you've reviewed ANY version of LOTRs, one cannot review any other version (Amazon software sees this as a second review of the same product by the same person!), I am placing this information here to the prospective benefit of other Amazon customers (and victims!) *.*

Now, on to the story:

This is the third entry in the film-trilogy of The Lord of Rings. I'm rating each one separately to yield a more honest opinion of the entire series. I'm rating 'The Fellowship of the Ring' 4-stars, 'The Two Towers' 5-stars, and, this one 4-stars.

The film trilogy is a fantasy, fairy-tale sort of movie series, to inform the uninitiated. The first of the three films tells of Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit of the Shire, and his quest, (along with a 'fellowship' of comrades), to save Middle Earth by destroying the ancient Ring of Power, which is in his possession. He can only do this by traveling to the Land of Mordor (a VERY nasty place) and tossing the ring into the fires of Mount Doom, whence the ring was originally forged by an evil wizard, Sauron, (who is still evil and still around, and who is seeking to locate his lost magical Ring of Power, big-time).

In 'The Two Towers', (the second entry of films), we find that Sauron (of Mordor) and another now-evil wizard, Saruman, (of Isengard) have teamed up to fight the remaining non-evil entities in an all-out power-grab for Middle Earth. Mordor and Isengard each boast a huge heavy-metal-type 'tower', hence the movie title.

The fellowship, having gotten split at the end of 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' in 'The Two Towers', runs into all manner of obstacles. Agendas also become mixed and there is much in-fighting amongst the various regional rulers which complicates defeating their common enemies, Sauron and Saruman. As a consequence of all this action, there is a LOT of jumping around in the film from place to place -- BUT, the director pulled off a coup: The story remains coherent, and pretty much stands on its own as a film. I would have thought this impossible and I wondered how they would ever do it successfully. But they did and I'm quite happy about it.

In this final, and third entry, all the marbles are up for grabs. Saruman was defanged in 'The Two Towers', so it's everybody against Sauron and his vast army of super-orcs and similarly nasty creatures. The 'quest' of Frodo Baggins becomes even more difficult as he is constantly plagued with the sabotage of Gollum, a slimy, devious little creature whom has served as his guide to Mordor but who also lusts for the Ring of Power. The movie culminates in a huge battle for Middle Earth at the gates of Mordor.

Now, the CINEMATOGRAPHY in all three of these films will knock you out -- superbly contrived, second to none. The COLOR SATURATION will bowl you over as well. The script and STORYLINE are not at all hokey and come off as quite coherent, which would have been a very difficult task as readers of the book(s) are well-aware.

I much appreciated the fact that the story remains close to the book(s), with few cuts and/or ommissions. Of course, this has made for a lengthy film, but one which will not bore you at all.

One critique of the film is that the same primary theme composition is used for all three films -- man, I got REALLY tired of that filmscore, even though other facets of it are brilliant. It's the up-front french horn one that I'm speaking of.

My final critique is that the director seems to have tired a bit in the final 45 minutes of this final entry and appears to have encountered  difficulty in wrapping up all the loose ends -- the '...and they lived happily ever after' caveat of the ending was a bit TOO happy and cloying to suit me. Whatever.

In the end, this is a very fine film, not necessarily for smaller kids, but A-O-K for teens. A last comment, don't waste time or money watching the FULL-SCREEN edition -- I've watched it that way (all three films) and you lose 2-stars when you do! This one MUST be viewed in widescreen only!",1194220800,3,5079,4.660335195530727
7274060,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"WOW!!!  Great special effects and edge of the seat action, with plot twists, interesting monsters, captivating characters, and some life lessons to boot.

The final episode of this trilogy earned a best picture award, an achievement the first two parts were nominated for but did not win.  The question is whether this was the most worthy, or if it won the award because the other two parts didn't, but either way, the award was deserved.

This picture comes across as one project broken up into three viewable segments, if you consider a 3 (or more) hour movie viewable.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was all filmed at once.  Thus, the flow between the movies are pretty seamless, and not seeming to be separate parts put together as most movie series are.

Vigo Mortenson does an excellent job as does Ian McKellan and John Rhys-Davies, and I enjoyed Kate Blanchett (I believe) as the elf queen and Orlando Bloom.  Personally, though, none compares Sean Astin's portrayal of Frodo's loyal companion, Sam.  There are characters who make you think of other people (though no one thinks they are that character), and there are characters who one can identify with.  The rare blessing is, like Sam, for the character to be one that you not only relate to, but motivates you to be the best you can be.  Sam is that kind of character.  I love the line where he said to Froddo, ""I cannot carry it (the ring), but I can carry you.""  I would love to be the kind of friend and encourager Sam is in this series.",1193356800,,1503,4.563432835820896

7274063,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I don't know what Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens were smoking when they decided to cut out all these extra scenes from the theatrical version, but I'm telling you it was something potent. The theatrical version was far too scattered and jumpy, nothing flowed, and so many important parts from the book were missing. However, the extended version flows SO much better, and some of the best scenes were missing. (And don't use the ""oh then it would be too long"" argument, because if you can't sit down for a good 4 hours for LOTR, you don't deserve to watch it anyways.)

And it should be a crime to tell the tale of Eowyn and not conclude it with her romance with Faramir. At least a misdemeanor. So let me tell you, don't watch the regular ROTK, only the extended, especially if you're a Tolkien fan. The only deleted scene that I'm really glad they deleted was the one with all the skulls falling out..yeah that was dumb.

As for the retelling of ROTK in general: Mostly good, missed ALOT from the book (NEVER replace the book with the movie...NEVER) but understandably could not include everything.  However, they did make some boo-boos. The part where Sam and Frodo's friendship seemed comprised--hi, that went directly against the book and what Tolkien was communicating in their friendship. Quite blasphemous I tell you. Fast-forward that part.

But I still respect the job they did, and although they don't do the book justice, the story is just so good that I had to give it a 5 stars. LOTR is definitely difficult to put onscreen, and I commend the makers.",1190505600,,1560,4.661818181818182

7274065,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"First of all, let me just say how impressed I was with the first two movies in this trilogy. They were outstanding films and deserving of all the awards they received. Perhaps that is one reason I was so disappointed in this movie; it wasn't nearly as interesting as the first two. The main reason can be summed up in my headline here.

Director Peter Jackson made the same mistake he made in the film he did right after this one: ""King Kong,"" where the action was way too much, too the point of ludicrousness and an insult to viewers' intelligence. So was this film, the third in the LOTR series.

It was too much action, so much that after halfway through this 3 hour, 20-minute movie I was numb and could care less what happened from that point. I stuck with it, but, overall, it committed the worst sin of them all for fantasy-adventure movie - it got boring. Too much violence translates into ""boring.""",1189987200,6,907,4.457831325301205

Yes the movie is 4 hours but for people who love movies and love great movies, it shouldnt matter how long a film is. If it was 6 hours, I would still watch it without complain. I cannot gush enough about this movie. Peter Jackson created a masterpiece that noone could possibly match. At least not anytime soon.
His attention to every detail is evident in this movie. The acting is wonderful, I even stopped cringing at Elijah Wood's acting after this film. And I absolutely adore the score to this. I own the soundtrack to all 3 films. I love them all. I don't own many other soundtracks but this is a must for anyone. I could go on and on.",1187740800,2,914,4.414201183431953

7274068,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"God Bless Peter Jackson for delivering this epic film (all 3) to us in the first place.  That must be said first.  But in Return of the King, there is simply some things that must be questioned in the story telling.  I know in a film the story must demand certain things, but that speech Aragorn gave to his men was so utterly stupid and embarrassing, it's hard to give the film anything more than a 3.5.  I mean, sure, William Wallace pulled it off BRILLIANTLY in Brave Heart, but this speech thing just backfired brutally.  He was completely unbelievable.  There was no moment likened to when Mel Gibson said, ""I AM WILLIAM WALLACE, and I see an army of my country men...""

Come ON.  Who thought of this?

Also, why make the oldest wisest creatures in Middle Earth look like a bunch of dumb idiots?  The Ents were powerful and wise in Tolkien's stories.  They CERTAINLY didn't have to be talked into going to war by a little hobbit.  Good lord!  And last but not least, Elrond.  What they heck is that person in the film supposed to be?  Certainly not Elrond, the amazingly wise and brilliant Elrond.  Come ON.  He was manipulating his daughter blatantly.  It was just crazy.

Other than these three seriously horrible things, the film was AMAZING.  My fav out of the 3 was Fellowship.

Again, I don't want to sound ungrateful to Peter Jackson for making these films.  I just wish some parts of the story could have been more true to the characters.

7274082,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I didn't see any of the movies at the theater. I figured I wouldn't like them- overblown Hollywood hype. Now I had read the Hobbit years before and seen the Hobbit carton as a kid, and I like those stories.

When my public library offered the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I checked them out and watched them. I was hooked, so hooked that I bought the movies. However, while watching the ones I bought, I swore something was missing. I did some research and found I had the theatrical release and I had watched the extended release the first time.

So I had to get the extended versions, because after watching those the first time, the theatrical version just didn't seem right.

As for The Return of the King- this movie is probably the most powerful of the three.

Most of the characters have changed, grown and become stronger since the first movie.

Theoden remains a strong character and shows why he is king.

Aragorn has also been a strong character, but here he becomes a leader of men.

Sam. Like Aragorn he becomes stronger.

And Merry and Pippen. They have matured.

Gandalf seems to purposely loose strength as he lets Aragorn get out of his shadow and become King. The old wizard is still as strong as ever, but I think he wanted Aragorn to step up as a leader. I think there is purpose in almost everything Gandalf does.

7274083,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"In a magnificent trilogy of films, this fimnal installment is truly the most magnificent of all.  So much has already been said about it that I won't belabor it except to say that visually, dramatically and musically -perfect.  It is dramatic and moving, just as it ought to be, and in all the right places.  Sam's fight with Shelob is actually scarier than in the book, and the final confrontation between Gollum and Frodo is even better than Tolkien portrayed it, hard as that is to imagine.  If any quibbles can be made, I think the fans universally disliked the elimination of Saruman and Wormtongue so early in the story, and Faramir still comes across as a weak shadow of his older brother.  As for Denethor, the movie never once explains why he is the sort of man he is, driven to despair and despiration because Sauron has been lying to him for years through a second palantir.  The battle for the Shire is absent, but that too was one of the many sacrifices made for dramatic purposes.

To portray the stories exactly as written, even 12 hours is far too short.  A 30-hour mini-series would have been necessary, and that is highly unlikely.

All things taken into consideration, the ""Lord of the Rings"" series is one of the finest movies or series of movies ever made. They have won

the hearts of a generation, they are stories of friendship, hope, love and salvation. They make you laugh, they make you cry and they have won many new readers for Tolkien's epic novel.

For me the viewing experience was always improved in the extended versions so out of curiosity I watched the extended version of Return.

  Return of the King in its extended version is an entirely different film  full of subtlety and explanations that were highlighted or neglected in the shorter release.

7274092,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"It is not the best episode though it is the crowning piece. Not the best because there are by far too many and too long battles which are quite repetitive in effects. But it is an essential episode to understand or extract some meaning in this fantasy. The vanity of the human king is turning criminal since he tries to burn his surviving son, who he does not like, alive. The hobbit Frodo who has been entrusted with the mission of carrying the ring back into the pit of hell is also shown as being vain somewhere in his mission. Vain because he believes he has been entrusted with this mission because he is special, though in fact it is the mission that is going to make him in the future somewhat special. Vain too because he does not understand he cannot succeed alone. And there the help of Sam is dramatically shown as essential to fulfill his mission,  not to betray it, not to let some kind of disgusting being and a giant spider of the deep caves of earth distract him and rob him of the ring, which it actually does, and not to fall into the pit himself along with the underground traitor and the ring. But the lesson is more for us than for the hobbit himself since he does not seem to learn his simple lesson very easily. The main lesson is that a batttle can only be won when everyone, including the dead come up and fight. This inclusion of the dead into the fight makes it slightly spectacular and is an allusion to Jesus and other Saviors who had to go down into the limboes or hell to do some salvaging with Adam and Eve or Euridyce. But the meaning - of the film - comes from some strong imagery used with a fair level of insistance. The world is cut in two. The dark forces of evil on one side to whom the ring has to be returned in order to be destroyed, and all the others representing light. Contrast between light and darkness, between underground traps, caves and tunnels and open air and countryside, between blue sky and very dark grey if not black sky, between the more or less civilized use of fire on the good side and its evil use on the bad side. The final battle is in front of the black gate that looks like a wall that finally crumbles and sinks into the ground at the end like some other wall fell in 1989. That can only be a modern vision since when the books were written the wall in question did not even stand. Since then this image has been turned around since two walls are being built but no longer by the forces of the east or the north, but by the forces of the west, one in Palestine and the other along Mexico's northern border (in that case the north is not supposed to be the bad side, and yet). History is twisty at times. The books were written during the Cold War and they represent this vision of the time of a world cut in two, black and white, etc. This today has changed too and this simple splitting of reality in two does not correspond to reality though it is still very active in the minds of people who still think a lot on an either/or line. So today, what used to be the reflection of cold war fear becomes rather simplistic and we experience everyday how this approach of the world and life leads to catastrophes and other swampy situations. The end of this third episode with the return of peace and quiet turns slightly emotional not to say sentimental or even sentimentalese. Too much crying indeed and too much sadness compensated by the joy of peace, love and a couple of weddings. Altogether it brings the tale to an end but it does not reach the height of the second episode, though we can see some of the inspiration of another recent series in the field of fantasy, Harry Potter who links the modern world with this underground fantasy world like Stephen King in the Dark Tower

Why Amazon has a listing for LOTR under HD-DVD but not Blu-Ray, I cannot comprehend. But hopefully New Line will be sensible enough to release it on the consumers' format of choice- Blu-Ray, that is.

Hopefully when the Blu-Ray version of LOTR comes, it will be given the same kind of royal treatment it got on DVD, and what The Ultimate Matrix Collection got for HD-DVD (and Blu-Ray this fall). Both versions of each film on the same, non-flipper disc would be nice, as would having an in-movie experience, commentarries, and hours of behind-the-scenes footage in HD.

I am NOT a couch potato.

Well, at least it was time well spent. Finally...some movies that really make the grade. I've been hard-pressed to find a good 5-star movie that I haven't seen. And here I've had these two sets of films that have been out there all this time that that for whatever reason I've had an aversion to. Silly me.

The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was movie making at its best. Especially considering that the movie had very high standards to live up to after more than 50 years of building such a loyal, cult following of the classic J.R.R. Tolkien book.

Hobbits, Elves, Men, Dwarves, Wizards, Orcs all co-surviving, albeit without much harmony, in Middle Earth. And all lust for the great Ring of Power made by the Dark Lord Sauron. But only little Frodo Baggins controls its Destiny. Thus is the 9-hour epic saga of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003).

There is a terrific list of A-list actors giving A-list performances. It's a long one: Therefore, most notably you have Elijah Wood as Frodo, Sean Astin as Sam, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Andy Serkis as Gollum (what a performance!), Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom as Legolas Greenleaf and John Rhys-Davies as Gimli. I know. I know....How could I not mention Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler and all the others??? Well, that's the point. The whole cast was awesome. Even the no-names that played Orcs.

Kudos to Director Peter Jackson for going beyond the Hollywood standard of 120 minutes to tell each chapter of the story. Jackson kept a lot of the character development that usually isn't transferred from novel to movie adaptation. And Jackson was a master not just at directing his cast, but at getting the special effects perfect. The Lord of the Rings movie adaptation will be as classic as the novel because of Jackson.

If you somehow missed these movies as I did until recently for whatever crazy reason, I hope that my little review has encouraged you to add them to your cart. As for Harry Potter...well that's another review entirely, of course.

7274105,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"Jackson gave the public what it wanted - battles - even though Tolkien never described Helm's Deep and Pelennor Fields in detail. Jackson ignored much of the deeper side of LOTR for action sequences; however, if he had stuck faithfully to the book, Jackson would never have reaped such profits.

I liked ROTR for its stellar presentation, especially the dead army, but I disliked it for its Hollywood influence. Jackson strikes blows for woman's rights with Eowyn; puts characters in places they never should have been, doing things they never did; too much Christian Right influence in this picture: Godlike Gandalf talks about Heaven, overt contrasts between evil-black and good-white.

ROTR reminded me of Return of the Jedi: It just overflowed too damn much with good feelings and good guy victories. I like a harder edge to my movies.",1167609600,,839,5.028776978417266
7274106,1,B00Z9YZRVE,"Despite its digital cast of millions, Jackson's trilogy actually manages to miniaturize Tolkien's epic tale. Example: the lighting of the war beacons at the beginning of RotK. In the book, they flare from east to west as Gandalf and Pippin ride from west to east.  It conveys the sense of a wider world in which events are unfolding independently of the characters' agency.  In the movie, the beacons flare only because Gandalf sends Pippin climbing up to light the one at Minas Tirith.  And at the other end, who of all the thousands at Theoden's court should notice but our old pal Aragorn! Lucky he was there, or the beacons would have burnt out and nothing would have happened.

These are just two out of dozens of POINTLESS changes that the movie makes in Tolkien's grand design.  No film could have captured it in full, but these clowns have dismantled the Colosseum to build a Wal-Mart.

The hobbits were very good (with the slight exception of Frodo who sometimes gets on my nerves when he disses Sam, his best friend). My two favorite scenes were when Billy Boyd as Pippin sang that song and Legelos finished off that elephant-thing (he is soooo cool). The ending is probably the worst part. It is dragged on WAY too long. What's with Frodo leaving and I don't care who Sam marries. Frankly I don't care that much about the Hobbits at all. They should have just ended it at the scene where Aragorn is crowned king. Otherwise this movie was AWESOME. It's very touching and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

7274109,1,B00Z9YZRVE,"I have read the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and its prequel, The Hobbit, many times.  After watching the Return of the King in the theaters and now on the DVD Platinum version, I am sick to heart that such a moving, dramatic, and inspiring story has been reduced to such trash.  Of course there is no way to faithfully compress the complexity of a deeply thought-out book such as this into a movie, and it is not this failure which leads me to complain.  What saddens me is that the details of the story that could have made great cinema have been altered or cut out, and that the movie resorts to the worst sort of cheap thrills churned out by Hollywood, to take their place.

Let me begin near the ending, with the destruction of the Ring, and the downfall of Sauron.  The entire storyline of a massive trilogy has built up to this point.  Surely, the simple fact of the Ring's destruction would be sufficiently dramatic to deeply move viewers.  It is the culmination of Frodo and Sam's heroic struggle, the passing of darkness from Middle Earth, the destination toward which all the many sub-plots of the story have been bent.  However, in director Peter Jackson's hands, such a perfect dramatic climax is not given the focus it deserves.  Instead, the ultimate moment is drawn-out and cluttered.  Gollum and the invisible Frodo struggle at the edge of the precipice above the river of lava for far too long.  Frodo falls over the edge, and must be rescued by Sam.  As the mountain explodes, Frodo and Sam escape, mere steps ahead of rivers of lava.  The entire land of Mordor is suddenly ripped open by earthquakes which engulf all the bad guys, but leave the army led by Aragorn miraculously unscathed.  By the time all this hubbub is over, the real drama of the moment has been lost.

It would have been excitement enough for me, had the movie simply shown Gollum charging at Frodo, quickly biting off his finger, and falling into the crevasse by the force of his own momentum.  Why did Jackson distract us from reveling in this victory?  Frodo and Sam need not overcome more obstacles at this point, to prove to us their worthiness.  Why throw Frodo over the cliff?  Why have them run from rivers of lava?  These scenes are meaningless--merely opportunities to make the audience gasp once more, and  for the special effects lab to show off its chops.

Well, I have vented enough for now.  Obviously, there are many more points to address, but this review is too long already.  I am deeply disappointed, not only that this beloved story has been mistreated, but also that so many Tolkien fans appear to be unable to distinguish between true drama and shallow melodrama, between real plot development and the instant gratification of impressive special effects.  I hope that someone out there who agrees with me posts a similar review here, because I am feeling alone amidst all this mindless adoration of a truly awful piece of work.",1165536000,17,2938,4.647286821705427
7274110,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Any review of ""Return of the King"" has to start from first principles: First, the books are too long to make into a movie, even a trilogy. Second, not everyone has read the books, or liked what they read. Sad but true. Third, of those who have read and liked the books, only a few of us have them mostly memorized. So any successful film production must take into account that parts of the books must be dropped, that the story has to be interesting and accessible to those who haven't read the trilogy, and that the movies must still honor the trilogy for those who have read - or memorized - Tolkien's life work. Those are the realities; we must judge the movie on those realities.

You can quibble over some very minor details, but Peter Jackson's telling of Return of the King balances these principles masterfully. Compression? Yes, of course. When Aragorn and Legolas lost the horses at the entrance to the Paths of the Dead, how, I asked myself, were they going to cross the hundreds of leagues from Erech to the Anduin? Excision? Yes, of course. The confrontation of Gandalf and Saruman. The confrontation with the Mouth of Saruman. The Houses of Healing. Imrahil. But the book trilogy is just too long to fit into three manageable movies. The absolutely critical scenes are all there. The story line is not lost or compromised. I will never know if it appears choppy to those unfamiliar with the books, but for me the compressions and excisions did not seriously detract.

Jackson also had to find a way to make the movie accessible to those who have never read the books. Those challenges included finding some way of demonstrating the pure evil of the One Ring. Those who have not read or do not remember the books don't know Tolkien's extended descriptions of what Frodo was experiencing. A movie maker's tools for making that introspection into exposition are pretty limited. The opening scene between Deagol and Smeagol brilliantly reminds viewers of the absolutely corrupting influence of the one Ring. Only by watching every character be tempted by the Ring, and watching many of those tempted succumb, can strangers to the Trilogy begin to know what Frodo was experiencing. The books are full of other, equally challenging problems for a scriptwriter and a director. Jackson handles them all quite well.

But Jackson also brought his own talents and imagination to the story. Is there anyone who wasn't transfixed by Jackson's invented sequence of Faramir's doomed charge on Osgiliath while Pippin is made to sing for Denethor? It's the difference between merely filming the book and making a movie. Jackson's additions range from brilliant to interesting; none of them detract from the story.

Finally, Jackson had to preserve the attention and respect of the sizeable minority of us who cherish the books. Speaking for myself, that moment came when Jackson had Aragorn turn to the crowd after his coronation, and recite, in Elvish, the words of Elendil when he came to Middle Earth. No subtitles; no explanation. Obviously, that line was for hard core fans alone. Having Aragron chant the lines was just icing on the cake.

The Extended Edition restores a few pieces of Tolkein's ploting, including a variant ending of the Saruman storyline. The Faramir-Eowyn theme is developed a bit. Everyone's favorite creep, The Mouth of Sauron, makes an appearance. Without taking anything away from these new pieces, it's clear why they didn't make the theatrical cut. They are fun, but not crucial. If anything, their omission demonstrates Peter Jackson's skill.

Brilliant special effects. Superb unity of plot, theme, and character across the three movies - compare Isildur's half smile when he declines to destroy the Ring at Elrond's urging with the look on Frodo's face at the penultimate moment. And the knife's edge balancing of these principles. This is an excellent adaptation, nearly flawless. Highly recommended.",1163635200,4,3933,4.9696048632218845

So, only 4 stars.

If you like action, fantasy, or medieval content, you should own this trilogy.  The effects are seamless, the acting is well done and the story keeps you involved at all times.

Lord of the Rings is quite a concept, originally brought forth by J.R.R. Tolkien decades ago. Unfortunately, his book was 1,137 pages long, which is a daunting read. Thankfully, his book has been brought to the big screen for more of a mainstream approach, and where more people can enjoy it. If nothing else, it is easier to enjoy.

The L.O.T.R. movies are not short by any means, but if the other option is reading over a thousand pages, I choose the movies. Besides, you will probably enjoy yourself so much watching the movies that they will not seem so long.

7274118,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"...I've been seeing a lot of negative reviews for the re-release of these three films on DVD. A lot of them are from people that don't even own them giving them a low rating simply because they are mad they already own the extended cuts, and want the documentaries on the new ones, but don't want to purchase them again. Now I don't blame them. I hate when a DVD is re-released many times over with little or no extras that than its predecessor. I however, disagree that they should be rated low simply because angry consumers that already own the previous versions are mad that they don't want to purchase them again. Now they have the right to be angry, but if you don't own them, you should not review them, let alone rate them the lowest score.

In short, you already know how great these movies are, if you do not already own them all, then they make a great buy. I purchased all three since I only owned the Theatrical Cut of ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" I was watching the extended cut last night and it got me all excited again. The box art is pretty freaking cool too, and the fact that they are not huge like the extended editions was a plus for me. They don't take a lot of room, which is good for me because I have soo many movies that the more space I can save the better.

Two - the documentaries leave much to be desired and don't let it be believed that these documentaries are entirely composed of unreleased footage - there is plenty of 'encore' presentation of the same tired footage (Astin's shard in the foot a prime example). I don't need to see or know that there was a semi-heated discussion regarding the distribution of walkie-talkies during the production. I would much rather have seen more of the stuff while they set up scenes on the mountainside with the fellowship or at Rivendell or....

Still, inspite of this new set containing both the theatrical versions and the extended cuts of the films and also the much hyped Costa Botes documentaries, my advise to anyone buying LOTR for the first time is- DO NOT BUY THIS SET! Spend a little more and you get all the movies in full 6.1 DTS EX glory, alongwith hours of endless in-depth bonus features which probably you'll spend rest of your life watching!!

Please be aware, these new editions DO NOT contain DTS tracks, no commentary tracks by the director, Weta workshop or the cast.

It would have been a better idea had New Line released the documentaries separately without forcing the consumer to buy the films again....And even this is not the end, once the HD format gains a little more acceptance, they'll have another excuse to come up with a new version of the trilogy!

The long build-up of war is amazing; the tension is real, and the individual stories of all the characters are spectacular to follow.  When the battle finally erupts the action is film-making history.  The climatic scenes of the trilogy are spectacular, and the extended scenes cover loose ends, more stunt sequences, and generally enrich the storyline.

Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. \Not only is the city under siege, but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his one remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the dead won't help him if Frodo doesn't destroy the Ring...

The ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess.

Peter Jackson really outdoes himself. You know those battle scenes in ""Two Towers"" and ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" with the swooping camera and thousands of orcs, clashing with men on a gloomy battlefield? In ""Return of the King,"" Jackson surpasses that. There's everything from volcanic eruptions to an invasion of howling ghosts to the attack of the oliphaunts (like elephants, only bigger). Each action scene a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't.

But if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. They cry, they hug, they think about home -- such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into equally rich movie dialogue.

Elijah Wood gives an unparalleled performance as Frodo Baggins. Frodo's gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the ""strong"" hobbit, rather than the follower. The final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated.

But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, and the ""I'm going to take care of you"" scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Mortensen gets more kingly every moment, while Ian McKellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom. Bernard Hill has a quietly moving final scene, while Miranda Otto makes the despairing Eowyn a strong, kick-butt heroine.

Perhaps the most striking thing about ""Return of the King"" is the final fourth of the film. While the ""multiple endings"" may annoy some viewers, it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden, splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending, Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron.

This edition contains both versions of the movie -- the original, shorter theatrical version, and the second extended edition with lots of extra footage. While the first one has nostalgia value, the second is undoubtedly the best. The scenes cause the movie to cleave more closely to the original novel, and even when they deviate -- such as Saruman's dramatic finale -- they add to the flow of the movie. There is also a special documentary filmed behind the scenes, apparently to draw in completists who just need EVERYTHING.

""Return of the King"" brings the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy to a close, and cements Jackson's reputation as a master filmmaker. With the outstanding cast, beautiful scripting and amazing direction, this is the best of the ""Lord"" films -- and that's saying something.",1153353600,12,4830,5.011221945137157
7274126,5,B00Z9YZRVE,I can watch this over and over and over again! It is an excellant movie!! A wonderful end to a great trilogy. Peter Jackson gives all he has to each movie so that they are all just as good if not better than the previous one. AND it goes along with JRR Tolkein's book. Even though there are parts of the book that aren't in the movie what do you expect if he had put it all in there these movies would have been at least 6 hours or more longer than they are I am sure. (I may be exaggerating a tad.) But this one is highly reccomended!!! BUY IT!!!,1152921600,,547,3.936936936936937

7274128,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"Don't get me wrong. I really like the movie. It moved me to tears a couple of times. But... (and you knew I was going to say that, didn't you?) but... WHY is my biggest comment/question.

Why did Jackson include long, drawn-out scenes of events that never happened in the books, yet omit important pieces of the actual plot? Why did he twist characters into unrecognizable simulations of themselves?

Major Spoilers Follow....

==========

Three and a half hours long, yet Jackson can't bother telling you what happens to Saruman? Or even have Wormtongue toss the Palintir out the window? And WHY make Denethor look like ""a spineless fool"" as one reviewer called him - and that comment right there shows that because of Jackson the general public will now never understand that Denethor wasn't a coward. He wasn't even cruel. He was insane - the Palintir that he found and used was twisted by Sauron, and he went insane. But we never see that. Just gross, disgusting table manners, senseless cruelty to Faramir, and complete inability to defend the White City. Unreal. And completely unbelieveable. And then, to turn him into a cartoon-ish fireball plopping off the top of the city? Why, oh why?

And then there were the events at the stairs. Why? Why have Frodo suddenly twisted by Gollum and tell Sam to go home? Because it had ""cinematic value""? As if we needed to have some kind of ""inner bond"" with Frodo and Gollum? Pah-leeze!

And then there was the return to the Shire - peaceful, idyllic, lovely. And apparently in a magical stasis field, completely protected from Saruman's evil. But hey, I suppose I could have lived with that, if Jackson had managed to get the scene at the Grey Havens right. Would it have hurt to even once mention that Frodo and Bilbo and Gandalf and the rest were going to the Undying Lands? And to make it the ""last ship"" leaving Middle Earth was ridiculous - when Tolkein was clear that later Sam, Gimli and Legolas also go to the Undying Lands, after the death of Aragorn, many years later.

Oh, and Arwen - dying if the Ring isn't destroyed? Did we need that? Bad enough the Sword that Was Broken is reforged and brought to Aragorn by Elrond, apparently just so Elrond and Arwen could show up an extra time or two (unlike Saruman!!) but to add in some kind of magical ""link"" with Arwen and the One Ring? Huh? Is she suddenly the heart and soul of Middle Earth, or something? Excuse me? And hey, while we're talking about Arwen - never mind that she never even thought of leaving Middle Earth and taking ship at the Grey Havens, would it have killed Jackson to include the rest of Aragorn and Arwen's children? I mean, as long as they were going to show the son, why not also show the daughters?

And Gandalf - although his little life-after-death speech was rather precious (and not in the book at all!) - why have him lose hope - more than once!?!?! Gandalf did NOT need reassurance from Aragorn to keep on going. At only one moment does he fear Frodo is dead, when the Mouth of Sauron presents the group with Frodo's belongings at the Black Gate (which would have been nice to see!), but it is a brief moment, and Gandalf never actually gives in to despair! Why do that to the character? Does Jackson have some desperate need to ""humanize"" The Enemy of Sauron, the Keeper of the Ring of Fire, sent by the Valar? Apparently so...

And finally, Faramir and Eowyn. Yep, there they are side by side at the end. And how did they meet? Do we assume that it's just an accident of crowd management, or do they like each other? Too bad filmgoers unfamiliar with the books will never know the beauty of Eowyn and Faramir's romance. Ah well...

Like I said - I liked the film. But in the end, it's a Hollywood adaption written by a scriptwriting team that was more concerned with special effects than the story. Jackson may have ""loved"" the books, but he obviously didn't understand Tolkein's underlying messages, which are virtually lost in the big-budget glitz. This story was never about fantasy and folklore, action and adventure - Tolkien himself was clear that it was a ""very Christian, in fact Catholic tale"". Too bad Jackson never seemed to truly understand that.",1151971200,12,4198,4.5927903871829105

Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still following the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the path to Mordor, with the increasingly strained Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realizes his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel...

I also would suggest not allowing a young teen to go through of the bonus sections without a parent.  There's quite a bit of major swearing by cast members, as well as a few other things that compare riding a horse to sex.  Too much.

7274134,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"Do I really need to offer a synopsis of a film that we've all seen? In fact, do you need to read yet another review that holds Jackson's directing and his cast's acting in high regard? No. That's not what I've done here, either.

Instead, I'd like to pay tribute to Tolkien, whose imagination sowed the seed that has grown into the Great Tree of this trilogy and its cultural shade.

(Yes, third time I've used that intro, if you've read my other two extended scenes reviews... so what?)  Artistic license sadly overstepped its bounds in this one.  The elimination of ""The Scourging of the Shire"" drops one of Tolkien's primary themes, and mutes the story's prophetic voice in the age of modernity.  Tolkien was trying to comment on the loss of innocence--his own, and his generation's--and demonstrate that despite that sad loss, hope need not be among the casualties.  We got the hope theme from the film, but the loss of innocence was insufficiently portrayed.  The War of the Ring did not even leave the Shire untouched (read the book--you should have before seeing the film anyway).  And just when a return home looks welcoming, the hobbits find one last chore between them and peace.

Nevertheless, the sheer number of digital effects/sequences, more Smeagol, the glory of Gondor, the horrors of war, the brilliance of the Ride of the Rohirrim (my aging professor quoted a couple of stanzas from Tennyson's ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" from memory, he was so inspired), and the heart-rending theme of loyalty relit make this an inspiring cinematic experience.  Jackson and crew have done the unachievable, and we sit spellbound.

How unachievable is it?  Check out the extra two discs to find out.  Make a day of it.  It's worth it.

Wish you'd left us the retaking of the Shire, Pete.  But I understand your reasons for not doing it.

7274135,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Sometimes, you hear about a movie they're going to make, and you cringe.

You cringe because, you're afraid--you know that things could go horribly, horribly wrong.

I felt that way when I heard that George Lucas was making Episode I. I felt that way when I heard that Tim Burton was going to remake Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. And, I felt that way when I heard that Peter Jackson was going to bring one of my favorite novels to the big screen--J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.

It was pretty much a common agreement among fans--The Lord of the Rings would be impossible to turn into a film (or films) worthy of it. It just couldn't be done.

Peter Jackson proved everyone wrong.

The Lord of the Rings is a perfect spectacle, capturing the essence exactly right. It is sweeping. It is epic. It is personal and touching. It is beautiful. It is frightening. It shows to everyone who'd never be bothered to read such a thing exactly why this story has captivated so many for so long. The casting just could not be better. Ian McKellen owns the role of Gandalf as he seems to own everything he attempts. And Sean Astin as Samwise... well... he's as dynamic and layered as they come. Gollum is, of course, a stunning achievement and wonderfully imagined. The scenes are majestic--the locations, stunning--the score is marvelous. In short, in everything it tries to do, this series of films succeeds and fulfills the promise of one of the best novels of the 20th Century.

Sure, not everything is included. There is no Tom Bombadil. There is no ""scouring of the Shire."" But enough is included to feel fully faithful to the novel and, at the same time, do everything that is required of a movie. Further, it's nice that there are still some surprises for those who decide to read the books because they've loved the movies.

Episode I was okay (though Episode III partially redeemed the effort). Charley and the Chocolate Factory would've probably best have gone unmade, to leave us with the memories of the far superior Gene Wilder. But in The Lord of the Rings, we have a series of films for the ages, well deserving of the accolades, awards and moneys it has received.

Five stars only because that's as high as it goes.",1148256000,3,2236,4.614609571788413
7274136,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The end is near. As the evil Lord Sauron's legions set forth to destroy all of mankind, Aragorn must meet his destiny and make a final stand for the forces of good. With friends Legolas, Gimli, and the great wizard Gandalf at his side, Aragorn will have to reclaim his birthright as King in order to save the people and land that he loves. But it will all be for nothing if Frodo and Sam do not make it to the fires of Mordor to destroy the One Ring of Power! With the untrustworthy Gollum as their guide, anything could happen before they are able to accomplish their goal. And who will survive the great battle? Both Merry and Pippin have been recruited for unlikely military positions, and the beautiful Eowyn is determined to make her stand on the battlefield as well. None of the Fellowship is free of danger in this final, awe-inspiring battle to save Middle Earth from the wicked eye of Sauron and his Ring of Power!

Based on the renowned books by author J. R. R. Tolkien, ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" is the OSCAR WINNING finale of a three-part fantasy epic that is mindblowing to say the least! Director Peter Jackson, surprisingly coming from a no-budget splatter film background, brings the world of Middle Earth to fantastic and astonishing reality! Intense detail in every aspect of the filmmaking process has resulted in a trilogy like no other. It is difficult to single out performances here, for every cast member is perfection. However, much acclaim for this final installment is given to actor Sean Astin in the powerful and emotional role of Samwise Gamgee, best friend of Frodo Baggins. Sean's performance is tremendous and propels the struggle of Frodo and the Ring to an astounding level. Of course, this is not to take away from Elijah Wood's brilliant portrayal of Frodo or Viggo Mortensen's as Aragorn. I'd also like to add that Sarah McLeod, who plays the tiny role of Sam's love-interest, Rosie Cotton, is absolutely adorable; probably my favorite female in the saga. In addition to the outstanding cast and direction, the visual effects are flawless, the music is inspiring, and the settings are incomparable. The great attention to detail results in a medieval world that, fantastic as it is, seems 100% real. The creatures are amazing, the battles are astounding and intense, and at the heart of it all is a message to never give up and never underestimate yourself or others. This is filmmaking at its finest. Can any one film of the trilogy stand alone as a viewing experience? Yes and no. The films are each fantastic and plenty lengthy, though there is never a dull moment, but they are unquestionably all one single story. They must ALL be seen consecutively and in order (though you don't have to watch them all in one day). This Widescreen, 2-disc edition of the DVD presents the film as it was released in theaters, with a beautiful widescreen format and a fine collection of extras that include: 2 ""making-of"" featurettes and a wonderful National Geographic special comparing the Lord of the Rings saga to real world history, 6 short web-featurettes, theatrical trailers and TV spots, a ""supertrailer"" for the entire saga, and a video game preview. No mention of the special ""extended edition"" DVD this time around. That's right, some time after the release of this theatrical edition, extended editions of the already lengthy films were released on DVD. Those must be REALLY long, and they probably have some great extras too; maybe the audio commentaries or production art we don't get here. Regardless, even Peter Jackson refers to the theatrical releases as the ""preferred versions."" So, make your choice. You might even feel like owning both versions. Any way you go, you can't lose; An AMAZING film saga, and this final chapter even won Best Picture at the Academy Awards! A fantasy film won Best Picture!

In the past, there have been animated versions of the Lord of the Rings and the preceding tale by J. R. R. Tolkien, ""The Hobbit."" You may want to discover these for yourself. I can't wholeheartedly recommend them, as I haven't seen them since childhood, and I recall the animation being a bit weak to say the least. Still, it's been a long time, but don't expect them to come anywhere near these versions. Also recommended for ""Lord of the Rings"" fans: The Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, Legend, The Last Unicorn, The Princess Bride, The Sword in the Stone, Excalibur, Dragonslayer, Merlin, the Harry Potter series, the Star Wars saga (still my favorite film series, but I'm a longtime fan), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Willow, Clash of the Titans, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Troy, Kingdom of Heaven, Army of Darkness, Fantasia, Braveheart, the Patriot, and I'm SURE I'm forgetting many more. Also, check out the stars of the Lord of the Rings in some of my all-time favorite films: Sean Astin in ""The Goonies,"" Elijah Wood in ""The Adventures of Huck Finn,"" Christopher Lee in the Hammer Dracula films, Ian McKellen in the X-Men films, John Rhys-Davies in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" and Orlando Bloom in ""Pirates of the Caribbean!""

7274137,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Lord of the Rings [Platinum Series Special Extended Edition] is one DVD release that has four disks that you NEED to own if you are any sort of fan of the trilogy. This already massive story comes with several new scenes as well as extended versions of original scenes that all add up to over 50 minutes of extended footage! This is one moving epic that deserves your attention to own, as the fellowhip prepares for the final battle for the ring and Frodo comes closer to Mount Doom.

The story I am sure you are familiar with. Sam and Frodo with their decietful guide Gollum, near Mount Doom on their quest to destroy the ring. [Or so they are led to believe by Gollum] Meanwhile Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli prepare along with the Kingdom of Rohan and it's king, Theodin, in preparation of the final battle of the one ring as Sauron sends out his massive ork army to destroy Gondor, the last major threat to his dark kingdom.

Several of the all new scenes really brings the scenes of the movie even closer together. For example, there is a short scene with Eowyn and Faramir in which they meet for the first time and talk, and Eowyn falls in love with him. In the original movie you just saw them standing next to each other during the crowning of Aragorn and was just left to assume they were together then.

Another new scene has a brief encounter with the King of the Ringwraiths and Gandalf the White as they meet during the horse chase as Faramir and his men retreat toward Gondor with the Ringwraiths in hot pursuit.

As well as great acting, there is great scenery and action as well. The battle for Gondor now has several new battle scenes in them such as orks storming the city gates and inside the courtyards, as well as more shots of the massive ork army by the black gate when Aragorn, Gandalf, and the others march toward the black gate to distract Sauron long enough for Frodo to slip past on the other side of the gate.

The reason I really loved Lord of the Rings was the scenery shots and there are some different scenes of the forest and the mountain ranges as Pippin lights the signal fires to call for help from Rohan.

There are so many new scenes in here it is impossible to describe them all, but they are worth watching and adding this DVD to your collection. I highly recommend this DVD to you because one day this will be a collectors item and it is truly worth watching just for the new scenes.

Extras include:

Commentary by nearly every actor and actress in the movie, on the moive.

A documentary on how J.R.R. Tolkein's book became a massive motion picture award winning trilogy.

Several documentaries showing you the different places of Middle Earth, and it's inhabitants

Costume designe documentaries

How the film team built Middle Earth

A map that traces the Fellowhip's route through Middle Earth towards Mount Doom and Mordor.

7274139,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Peter Jackson would comment that the term ""director's cut"" would imply that the film you saw in theatres was somehow flawed and not what he had intended. The extended cuts are kind of like alternative versions of the film, a kind of ""if you want, here it is"" kind of version. He prefers the theatrical cut but in case you wanted to see additional stuff, that's available. While the material included is cool and fascinating, there's a reason why it was cut, as this version will show.

Not gonna spend any time with the story aspect since I already covered it in the first DVD release. The new stuff has some new additions, some sorely missed, others thankfully exercised. There is no Scouring of the Shire since I don't think they even filmed it but of the scenes fans wanted to see, all of them are here so no reason to complain. I'll delve into the main additions.

The Voice of Saruman: Saruman stands high atop his tower(which is funny because it's so high and yet people can talk normal voiced at times and he can hear perfectly) and Grima shows up, which doesn't end well for both of them.

The Path of the Dead: Instead of the suspense cut of the original, we see how the Army came to be on our side. It's nice scenes but it does kill the suspense.

The Witch-King of Angmar: Gandalf's brief encounter with the Lord of the Nazgul is featured here.

The Houses of Healing: Disappointing cause it's actually really short, probably about a minute of screen time. It does show Eowyn meeting and then falling in love with Faramir.

The Mouth of Sauron: Instead of 10,000 Orcs appearing, a creature acting like Sauron's agent comes first. He taunts the group only to have Aragorn snap and do some kingly justice to him.

Other scenes are just tiny additions or full scenes but they don't really have much significance. Those 5 are probably the worthwhile additions but most likely for pacing they were exorcised.

The special features are just like the others with no less than 4 commentaries(overkill since the Director/Writer one is probably the best and the Cast is the most fun) and featurettes and documentaries on the costumes, effects, sound and even digital horses.

If you're a Lord of the Rings fan this is obvious. If you were a fan of the film than this is worthwhile too. Keep in mind it is a 4 hour film start to finish in this version so you may want to actually schedule it in.",1144800000,8,2395,4.525462962962963
7274140,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I originally ordered this item on March 12th, 2006.  With the way I keep getting asked to give permission to extend the shipping deadline, I'm thinking I might end up waiting until March 12th, 2007 before it even goes out.

Normally I receive very good, very fast service with amazon.com, and this appears to be the only exception.  And I place the blame squarely on the seller, whom I cannot seem to locate contact information for.

I agreed to plop down the $63.99 price + s/h fir this item.  I think after all the delays I ought to get a significant discount if or when it finally does get shipped out.

Now the film itself is superb, and is an excellent finisher to a lengthy film trilogy.  Being something of a book-to-film purist, I kind of wish Jackson had kept Saruman's and Wormtongue's original fates--in the book, they both die in Hobbiton.  But, Jackson is a master of dramatic/creative license and Christopher Lee's death scene at Isengard in the extended DVD more than makes up for the alteration.  The thing to remember for fans of the movies is, this was always meant to be an epic story; it's supposed to be an all day adventure for filmgoers, when you take in the trilogy as a whole.  I highly recommend scheduling a day off during the week and invite friends over to watch all three extended versions, back to back.  Set up lunch and dinner breaks in between films, as well as bathroom breaks, and enjoy the day's adventure.

All in all, my only real complaint is the hideous delay in shipping.  I should not have to wait a month or more for the iten to ship, and if the seller is wise he'll spot me a nice discount on the original $64 price for the trouble.  That is, of course, assuming the item ships at all; I'm half tempted next time they ask for an extension to just cancel the order. If I didn't want this collector's copy so badly, I would do just that.  I hope the seller reads this.",1144800000,2,1911,4.404558404558404

7274142,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"In the Frighteners special features, Peter Jackson mentions that it was the middle path going from independent films like Heavenly Creatures to effect heavy stuff like Lord of the Rings and King Kong. Which of course makes you think how exactly did he go from low budget gory films to an excellent indie to a good thriller than do these films? He sure matured as a filmmaker really quickly and Return of the King finds him combining everything into one great, but really long film.

Concluding the Lord of the Rings trilogy: we find Sam and Frodo continuing their trek to Mount Doom with Gollum; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli going through an unorthodox method of getting help and the Hobbits being separated on 2 sides of a war. This will culminate in the massive Battle of Pelennor Fields as Frodo tries to destroy the One Ring while braving a massive creature.

One complaint about the film is that it's quite length. It's always funny when people say the film's 3 and a 1/2 hours even though my clock said it was 3:10. I will say though that film does run long in parts, some of which unneedingly. Yeah we should care about the characters but when they go ""this upcoming battle is going to be dangerous"" than somebody else goes ""the next battle will need all the help we can get"" it seems kind of obvious. I have absolutely no issue with the ending actually; it ends the way it ought to. The only thing I didn't like was the fadeouts which made the false endings that much false.

One thing that Jackson LOVES is his wide shots where the camera is extremely far away from the action, showing the scale and scope of the scene such as the big battle scene. Unfortunately it doesn't have the drama that it does when we're on the ground right in the thick of it. When you have 10,000 characters who are no bigger than a fingernail it's not as dramatic but when we go under Mumakils legs and dodging its feet we feel this is an intense battle. The CG is great in parts although the big crowd scenes look slightly too computer-y. Shelob however is marvelously done, looking creepy and menacing. And Gollum, while not a huge improvement, is still great. Not only that, he's in my favorite shot of the entire film: when we follow him alllll the way down when he falls off a cliff.

If you want a nice big of epic fun, I very much recommend Return of the King but be forewarned it's long in parts and the Extended Edition is even moreso although it does have all the special features.

This movie did a great job of tying everything together and unfolidng the rest of this incredible epic.  There were crazy battles, profound moments of humanity, and everything in between. The bad guys were REALLY bad and the good guys were REALLY good which made for some serious tension.  Each character was revealed to their fullest and in most cases you could feel their pain and joy right along with them.

The ending was pretty dramatic with an added twist that you will certainly like and probably not expect.  Alls I can say is that by all means you should see this film to wrap up one of , if not the greatest trilogy ever created.

Oh yeah, Of course there are a FEW tiny things that were not perfect so like a good reviewer I have to spell them out:

- Not enough Good guys get killed off.  Too often, they seem dead or you think that one of them might die.... but they only miraculously get out of trouble or come back to life.

- The ending did drag a bit, especially in the extended version but what the heck.... not a big deal.

I lament that all is made with computor images, and not through stop motion

technique using real models. A computor image can be very realistically

made, but still lacks a certain something, a sense of real

manifested mass and presence. One of the last great stop motion creatures

used on screen was the dragon in the movie Dragonslayer; is was very

advanced and had a computorized mechanism called Go Motion to give it

carefully adjusted movements. Here the computor had, as it should, a

supporting role, instead of totally taking over. It is a pity that this

branch of effects work was abandoned for the less costly CGI. Because the

use of a model gives by itself a sense of presence on the screen, that can't

fully be achieved with the illusion of the computor image. A real model

brings an actuality of sharpness to movements, forms, colors, lights and

shadows. The continuation of the Go Motion technique would have been an

investment for the future, and led to many interesting discoveries

in anatomical and engineering mechanics, developed the knowledge of hard and

elastic complex materials, and would have been a major factor in the

advancement of robotics. Instead the film industry exclusively chose, for

7274148,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I have seen all three of the Extended DVD Editions of Lord of the Rings, and
I can't help but ask the following questions:

How could a film team in New Zeeland, without prior experience of advanced
film making, be able to create the mastodont Lord of the Rings film trilogy?
How could Peter Jackson, who previously had done low budget splatter films
like Bad Taste and Braindead, pull this off? I am baffled.

How could this massive amount of visual material be created and put together
in such a comparably short time? How could it all be coordinated and
harmonized into such a consistent whole? How could the genuine feeling of
culture and history of a whole world be created in that short time? It
doesn't add up. It's not natural. And it doesn't matter that the film crew
in the extra documentary material on the DVDs tell us how dedicated and hard
they worked; it still doesn't add up. I am telling you, it ain't natural.
There must have been some paranormal or magical forces involved in the
making, or perhaps Tolkien's spirit coordinated the work.

How could they find so many actors that fit so perfectly into the roles, and
acted as if they actually were their role characters and not hired actors?
And all integrated with the visual environments and special effects work.
Incomprehensible. Supermundane forces must have played a part .

I can see some minor weak points in the films, but on the whole they stand
as a world on its own, above the reach of criticism. As with the books my
favorite is The Fellowship of the Ring. The Two Towers feels a little like
transportation (I thought the weakest part here was the Ent. He felt
unconvincing and childish with his too obvious human characteristics and
expressions, like an illustration from a children's book. And some of
the orcs look a little too caricaturish with their long noses.)
When reading the books I imagine characters and environments a little
differently, more mundane down to earth, with ordinary persons put in
extraordinary situations, so that there becomes a strong contrast. For
example, the Shire countryside being mellow in tone, to contrast more with
the magic glimmering of the Elven world. In the film, all the main
characters glow with charisma, and everything is really intense, from colors
to acting. But that is alright. It is still very well done. And there is no
definite way, because everyone who reads the books has his or her personal
vision.
The Return of the King has grown upon me, and it is just as great as the
first film, but in a different way; it has grand beauty within the context
of war. Oooh, and that green dress Arwen is wearing at the wedding! A color
from beyond this world!

The Extended Editions have many great scenes added, especially in The Return
of the King. Who can forget the episode with Gandalf and Pipin atop Minas
Tirith, by the white tree, talking of days gone past? Or the Mouth of
Sauron!?

The extra material is very generous. Sometimes a little too generous,
because every magic trick is revealed.  But if you are yourself an artist,
or work with film, it is indispensible information, and very enjoyable to
watch.
Those involved in the films also tell us how difficult it was to break up
when it was all over. I can imagine the making of these films was a burnout
for some, difficult to top off. To them I can say that, the cosmos is
limitless, and there is always some new beauty around the corner.",1142812800,3,3429,4.620689655172414

7274157,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Peter Jackson's interpretation of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy sets a number of high water marks for modern film, and ""The Return of the King"" meets the seemingly impossible feat of surpassing the expectations Jackson set with ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers.""

Tolkien once famously said that he thought that his novels were essentially unfilmable, which is why he let the movie rights go for a pittance (this is one of the stories you learn in one of the excellently informative documentaries about the movie contained on Discs 3 and 4).  Jackson proved the master wrong (to a point), using an unusual combination of fidelity to the original source material as well as taking the story in some new, more cinematic ways.  Those looking for a shot-for-shot retelling of Tolkien's novels will be disappointed, but Tolkien was probably right that as written, his novels were great novels but would be poor screenplays.

Quite simply, Tolkien's world and his story was too vast to be contained in a mere film - that's why you see so many dog-eared copies of his books, worn out by repeat readings.  Jackson came about as close as you could to telling the whole story in his movies, but he realized that changes needed to be made.  In doing so, Jackson still created a rich, vibrant world with sufficient depth and detail that it's worth romping through again and again, and this extended version of the original film allows those of us with a passion for the War of the Ring to roll up our sleeves and dive in once again.

I'll leave it to others to summarize the plot points and excellent ""extras"" and extended/new scenes this 4-disc collection provides.  I'll focus on the reactions that we had when we had a recent party to watch this Extended Edition for the first time:

- Outright cheering when the Riders of Rohan charge the orcs on the Battle of Pellenor Fields, when Pippin lights the beacons to call Rohan to battle, when Legolas single-handedly brings down a Mumakil, and when Eowyn takes out the Witch-King.

- Laughter when Sam takes out an orc ""and that's for my Old Gaffer!"" and when Merry and Pippin get stoned on the ruins of Isengard.

- Gasps in horror as Frodo and Sam battle the monstrous spider Shelob and when Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas walk the Paths of the Dead, and during the debate with the Mouth of Sauron.

- Stark silence broken by sobs when Sam picks up Frodo to carry him on Mount Doom, when Eowyn meets the Theoden for the last time, and of course at the Grey Havens.

- Calls for ""start it again!"" when Sam finally says, ""Well, I'm back.""

- And speculation of Roger Ebert's motives when he gave this movie only three and a half stars, complaining that Jackson's story left genuine human emotion aside in exchange for ""surface and archetype, oddly invoking ""Apocalypse Now"" as an exemplar of the former.  (If anything, ""Return of the King"" is the most focused on emotion and multi-layered conflict of the three films, and by the time Sam returns to Hobbiton to reunite with his family, you feel like you've been through an emotional wringer.  Sure, dedication, hope and despair, and self-sacrifice may not be the most nuanced of emotions, but to criticize this movie for its absence of emotional heft is just plain anti-fantasy snobbery.)

Of all the times I've watched movies with friends and family, I've never seen a stronger, more emotional reaction to a movie (which is saying something, considering we were cramped in a small viewing area for just over 4 hours).  From Howard Shore's original music, to the wonderful artistic renditions of Middle Earth, to the outstanding special effects and the pitch-perfect acting, ""The Return of the King"" is an example of just how darn good movies can be.  My biggest concern is that I'll watch it too much!

I'll only say one thing more about the extras available on this DVD.  One feature talks about the connection between the Academy Award-winning song, ""Into the West,"" sung by Annie Lennox, and a teenage director who grew very close to Peter Jackson's crew before losing a battle with cancer.  If you didn't get misty listening to ""Into the West,"" which is a song about Frodo's journey from the Grey Havens, you will when you connect it to the story of this remarkable young man.

This entire trilogy is a must for the film library, and the extended special editions of the DVDs are excellent versions.",1140393600,,4419,4.717815344603381

This movie is pretty good, when considering the time limitations. They had to take out some of my favorite parts of the book to keep the movie just under forever. I'm still watching this movie, but it must be pretty good, considering that it won every academy award they had in 2004, including best SHORT feature. This movie does an interesting job of incorporating somewhat grotesque images of mouths, or as my esteemed colleague refers to them as ""gross mouth pictures"" I was also able to learn that digital images can be schizophrenic. This story is an adaptation of Wagner's ""Ring Cycle"", which is an adaptation of Nordic mythology, which is an adaptation of fact, so you can say that this movie is based on a true story, although all of the characters do have somewhat odd names. They all live in the middle of the earth, which looks strikingly like New Zealand. The story tells of a ring that a bunch of people want, it doesnt look so great to me, but I'm not a hobbit; they aren't like us. After viewing much of this movie, I have reason to believe that J.R.R. Tolkien was on crack.",1139097600,4,1366,4.374015748031496
7274159,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"A great film, not to be missed. The music is wonderful and the special effects are great. In some respects, the movie is actually better than the book; it gives Arwen a bigger role, and moves the story along faster. The cast is good. Orlando Bloom especially shines as Legolas. In the books Legolas is a surprisingly minor character. Peter Jackson was clearly smart enough to see he had a real find in this actor and gave him extra screen time.

The Lord of the Rings films do a good job of harmless escapism. They also have a more serious message. Tolkien saw firsthand as he was growing up the destruction of the English countryside. This process has now progressed to the point where there is hardly a beautiful and untouched place on the earth, only teeming humanity as our population goes up and up. Is this really what we want? Is it making us happier? Seems more like the sort of plan Saruman or Sauron would have.

The movie does have its faults.  I thought it was very strange that the orcs made a highly disiplined attack on Minas Tirith, while the defense was totally disorganized. Using trebuchets to throw rocks at the attacking orcs from the walls of the city as part of the defense struck me as simply silly.  Maybe I know too much about actual medieval warfare. The whole attack on Minas Tirith seemed a bit over the top to me.  How many hundreds of thousands of attackers do you need to make an assault seem exciting?

As to the extra shots in the DVD, some were good, while with others I tend to agree with the original decision to leave them out. The scene with Sam and Frodo getting mistaken for orcs is so good that I find it hard to believe it wasn't in the original cut.  On the other hand, I thought the death of Saruman was hokey.  The goodbye scene at the Grey Havens, which was way too long even in the original movie, is now even longer here.

The commentaries and documentaries do a lot of fawning over Peter Jackson.  Certainly the guy did brilliantly with these films, but the impression I get is that I'm extremely glad I don't work for him.  He seems like a world-class talent at spending way too much time at obsessing over the trivial, then trying to make up for it at the last moment by working his subordinates beyond the point of exhaustion.",1139011200,,2279,4.41527446300716

7274163,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"OK, call me a book nerd, but I wasn't as impressed as most of the other reviewers with either the theatrical release or extended edition.

Some elements from the book obviously had to be omitted or changed for cinematic reasons.  However, Jackson made many changes for no evident reason which detract from the coherence and internal logic of the original story.

Case in point:  The Ride of the Rohirrim, one of the most dramatic events in the tale.  In Tolkien's account the attack succeeds due to stealth.  The riders arrive silently, orc scouts have been slain or scattered and the Black Captain's attention is focused solely on the city.  Suddenly, Theoden and his men savagely charge into the besieging army.  The orcs are thrown into terror and confusion as 6,000 mounted warriors unexpectedly smash into their ranks.  If, as Jackson depicts it, the orcs had been given time to turn their flank and set their pikes they would have been dining on Rohirrim that night in the halls of Minas Tirith.

The number of other unfortunate departures from Tolkien is too great to usefully mention.  Just a few would include the silly avalanche of skulls in the haunted mountain, the dead king's last minute decision to fulfill his oath to Aragorn (hmm...would that qualify as a death bed conversion?), the laughable confrontation with the corsair ship, Gandalf's totally out of character bludgeoning of Denethor, Sam's swordplay in the tower of Cirith Ungol, the cartoonish scaling of a war mamluk by Legolas.....well, you get the idea.

I don't insist that a movie must slavishly reproduce the book.  But why make changes that diminish the original story rather than improve it?  Perhaps creative people simply can't resist the urge to tinker.

That said, Jackson's trilogy is still a spectacular achievement.  He faithfully adheres to the essence and general story line of the book and successfully creates a convincing Middle Earth.  And in fairness, only the most dedicated of Tolkien fans are likely to quibble over the differences.",1137369600,5,2032,5.017910447761194

Overall, I felt that they could have cut a half hour from the movie and it would have benefited.

However, once I saw the extended version I completely changed my mind!  Suddenly, with the extra scenes all the holes were filled in and the lengthy battles and long goodbyes fit much better in that context.  I could better see how the pieces fit together.  And it was beautiful, a masterpiece!  I've now watched the whole thing over 15 times through.

The fellowship comes back with a heart stopping action adventure film. Frodo continues his quest to destroy the one ring. Darkness reigns upon them as Sauron calls on his army to search for the ring and destroy anything in it's wake. It had a very dramatic ending. When we all think that Golum could still be transformed and turned back to the good side, he is actually the one who can't stand to take the ring away from Frodo's hands and falls to his death in Mordor.

With Gandalf back, Merry and Pippin found, Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli back from their search for the rest, they head for Minas Tirith where the big war is fought. Orcs and orgres emerge from mordor for the fight.

The visual effects together with the soundtrack had a very equal blend. Everything just fitted perfectly like a jigsaw puzzle. The scenery was amazingly spectacular.

I bought all 3 DVDs because of all the popularity it received and I didn't regret a single bit. I'm even happy I didn't watch the movies in the cinema and have to wait every year for a coninuation. Watching all 3 in DVD non-stop is one thing I hardly do but in this case, you just can't stop sometimes.

I also recommend you all to buy the soundtrack. Everything sounds so solemn and uniquely peaceful. You really get to enjoy every bit of this movie and no matter how many times you watch it, you'd never get tired of it.

In contrast to both The Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers extended versions, many of the added scenes could have been left out.  However, this does not detract from the overall quality of the film.",1135900800,,252,4.340425531914893
7274167,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Like most fans, I approached the theatrical release of ""Fellowship"" with apprehension, to say the least. But of course Jackson & co. did an astounding job, and  it was obvious from the beginning that the writers & designers had a great respect and understanding of Tolkien's world. ""Return of the King"" is without a doubt the pinnacle of their supurb work: incredible CGI, exquisit scenes/locations/costumes/props, believable and surprisingly good acting, and one of the best screenplays of all time.

The extended edition adds more of everything we love to the story.  Die-hard fans of Tolkien will love all the extra footage, especially the sideline stories like the House of Healing and the Mouth of Sauron.  People who don't absolutely love LOTR will likely find the over four hours' worth of film exhausting and bombastic, though.  Jackson didn't even shoot ""The Scouring of the Shire,"" so don't expect anything new with the ending. Otherwise, with this longer version, we see just how accurately he created Middle-Earth, and the changes/omissions were minute enough (or logical enough for film adaptation) that Tolkien's world loses none of its splendor.

The two disks of Appendices are such a thrill. They are not a repeat of the material in the Fellowship and Two Towers extended editions. It is amazing how much detail went into these movies, much of which we can never see on screen, and it was fun to go back and look for those details in the movie.",1135814400,2,1461,4.967213114754099

The extended versions are a nice touch, simply because those of us who really enjoyed the films but missed some of the cut moments can enjoy a more complete experience.  The controversial Saruman confrontation is here, although not necessarily done to the liking of the literary fans.  It serves the film, though.  We do see here the houses of the healing, as well as the beginnings of romance between Faramir and Eowyn.  What happens between the paths of the dead and Aragorn's attack at Pelennor Field is fleshed out as well.  The die-hard fans will certainly prefer this version, in spite of, or maybe even because of, its length.  My only complaint: in the appendix of the book, Tolkien gives a timeline of the Fellowship, showing what they did with the rest of their lives.  I would have liked to have seen that included as a narration.  But that minor inadequacy is not enough for me to penalize this excellent final product.

There are very few films that I like well enough to listen to director's commentary, and on a 4 HOUR PLUS movie, one could particularly think that it would be a waste of time.  However, Jackson, Boyens and Walsh manage to provide a briksly paced commentary filled with actual information instead of the usual long silences and pointless narrating at which so many directors excel.

The commentary is also very revealing.  Repeatedly, Jackson and co. mention certain scenes that were cut AND NOT INCLUDED IN THE DVD -- including a scene between Treebeard and Legolas that would have been great to see, since Treebeard is my favorite character from both the books and the movies, and Orlando Bloom is hot.  They make CONTINUOUS references to things that were NOT included -- and worst of all, they keep saying that these things were DELIBERATELY left out, to be included on the 25th Anniversary edition of the movie.

***********WHAT????????***********

This really pisses me off.  I mean, I'm a die-hard.  I own all the extended DVDs AND all the theatrical releases because I wanted every version of every film and every extra there is.  All together that adds up to $200 spent on this trilogy, lining Jackson's pockets.  And now he's baiting us with the fact that he plans to line those pockets even more in 25 years.  I've never heard of anything so greedy and manipulative, and it kills me to think that I spent all that money and STILL don't have everything.

I thought this project was about art and grandeur and wonder, but I was wrong -- it, like everything, is just about money.  Well I'm not buying in 25 years, so they aren't getting any more of mine.  I'm sorry that some of the magic of these movies was spoiled for me by this unwelcome news, but I still can't bring myself to remove more than one star because let's face it: no matter what the motivations for them was, these are great movies.",1134086400,6,1969,4.6502890173410405

Highly recommended, if you are unfamiliar with this trilogy, make sure you start from the first movie ""Fellowship of the ring"", then watch the 2nd movie ""Two towers"" and then this one which concludes the movie trilogy.

One interesting tidbit of information uncovered in special features is that the art department and Weta workshop pressed themselves to meet the tight film deadline because Peter Jackson kept coming up with fresh ideas and concepts.  As marvelous as the theatrical version is, it feels rushed.  To give an idea of the time constraint, Peter did not actually watch the film in its entirety until the world premier in New Zealand.  Further, he went back and shot one final pick-up after a grand sweep at the Academy awards!  (All this is tastefully documented on disk 4.)  Re-editing restored some scenes, expanded others and introduced new ones.  As a result, the destruction of the ring and the subsequent collapse of Barad-dur are visually and emotionally more satisfying in the extended DVD.  They feel operatic.

7274174,1,B00Z9YZRVE,"To be fair, it's only been five years, but we already have a winner. In the winter of 2003, audiences that were left numb and confused by the ending (or lack thereof) of the first installment of the LOTR trilogy two years earlier flocked to the theaters, now fully inculcated into sheeple culture, knowing they would ""like"" this film before they even laid eyes on it. After all, the critics had already unanimously told them that. And fans of the novelized Middle Earth trilogy weren't seeing this film at all-- they were seeing images onscreen that filled in or replaced portions of their own memory of a masterly literary work. With such a powerful emperor, having no clothes no is trick at all.

Yet to the utter shame of the film establishment, this movie truly is the emperor with no clothes. The one-dimensional, caricatured characters, in most cases soulless as they ""come to life"" on screen, the easy maudlin sentimentality, the sickening predictability, and the embarassing self-consciousness of this film have all too often been overlooked by overeager fans. All of this comes on top of two cinematic tools that can only be described as the ultimate embodiment of the worst cliches in hollywood filmmaking that emerged from the blockbuster era of the 1990s: The replacement of art with grandoise special effects, ala Jurassic Park (1993), and the overreliance on a massive battle scene, ala Return of the Jedi (1983) and Braveheart (1995). The thing with cliches is that once created, they tend to crescendo as they are used over and over again, until they finally come into form in one film that so overuses them, in such a hideous way, that they finally begin to fall from favor. And hopefully this is what LOTR: Return of the King has done for these two particular cliches. Yet it's not until you're done watching this giant monstrosity that you realize you haven't seen a masterpiece-- no, you've been knocked over the head with a blunt object so strong, with such unprecedented pretensions at sagadom, that you don't know what hit you.

Hopefully, LOTR:ROTK represents a turning point in Hollywood cinema. Now that Hollywood has finally done the biggest it can possibly do, audiences can no longer be wowed simply by increasing the scale of a film. Hollywood will have to return to making better films. In that case, let's just hope the critics can still tell quality filmmaking from expensive filmmaking.",1132531200,25,2420,4.9
7274175,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I would give this movie 10 stars if i could, but since this is about the Extended Edition, i'd like to say that the extra scenes are great, especially the part with saruman. the end of that scene is almost exactly like the end of the Scouring of the Shire, except that it takes place at orthanc, and Gandalf is there.

That being said, i'd like to mention one part that makes me hate Peter Jackson with a passion for about 3 mintues: Gandalf's confontation with the witch-king of Angmar. For those of you who have seen it, the witch-king intercepts Gandalf, says a few words, erupts his sword into flame, then breaks Gandalf's staff, throwing Gandalf off his horse, onto the ground.

To me, that is a total degradation of Gandalf's character.

1) Gandalf is more powerful than the witch-king, period.

2) Gandalf fought and killed a BALROG (also more powerful than the witch-king) when he was gandalf the GREY. he was sent back as gandalf the WHITE, more powerful than he was.

so why would the witch-king, a MAN with minimal power, be able to  break GANDALF THE WHITE's STAFF, and throw him onto the ground, cowering like a little kid???

and if u watch the regular cut closely, you can see that Jackson was alluding to this part through whole movie. Gandalf explains to Pippin about the Witchking, clearly showing some type of fear. The witch-king also tells Gothmog, when asked about ""the wizard"", ""I will break him"".

If Peter Jackson felt he had to give Gandalf some type of nemesis from Mordor, i'm fine with the witch-king being that character. But I'm not fine with the fact that Jackson made the WitchKing so much more powerful. It just wouldn't happen. If anyone has explanations, please tell....

no wonder that part was cut.",1132358400,11,1736,4.647058823529412
7274176,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"What more could you ask for in a DVD?  The movie itself is amazing and the special features are surprisingly very comprehensive.  Most special features on other DVDs involve nothing but actors saying how ""great the film is"" or how the director is ""such a passionate genius.""  None of that BS is found here, you actually learn about the making of the film.

First off, the movie.  I was blown away when I saw the first edition in theaters, it was trully awesome.  I was a bit hesitant to purchase the Extended Editions of the three films becuase I thought they were long enough already.  Boy was I wrong.  All of them add so much to the story and the characters, it's well worth a purchase even if you have the original versions.  Don't assume that all the scenes added are boring ones, however.  Major action scenes are added (especially for ROTK) and bits and peices are added to the current scenes.  At four hours, the EE of ROTK actually goes by faster than the original because of all the action that was added.  The battle of Minas Tirith (best battle scene ever by far...like holy crap, man) is made better by many added special effects shots.  The best new scene is one in which Gandalf and his band of traveling minstrels (haha) face off against Sauron in the very beggining.  I watched this thinking, why the feck did PJ cut this?  The moral of the story is, get the Extended Editions, for they are far superior.

Now, on to the special features.......Amazing!  They cover everything.  It is quite long, however, so it may take you three to five days to watch depending on your level of geekiness.  My favorite of all the featurettes is the visual effects.  I just find that stuff so interesting.  It talks about the battles, the creatures, the landscapes, and the shear scope of what weta had to do for this film.  I watched the movie, watched the special features, and then watched the movie again with my newfound knowledge of how they made it.  That's how good the special features are, they're inspirational.

In conclusion, this is a must have if you liked the original Return of the King.  This is better.  If you like this one, then I recommend getting the Extended Editions of the other two as well.",1131926400,6,2217,4.5353535353535355

Star ratings mean nothing,not even to the person that sets them.

How can one person determine how good or bad a film is by granting a number of stars to it. The great thing about films is that they mean something different to everybody. Each member of an audience has an opinion.

My relationship with the LOTR trilogy has always been a complicated one. I would be a liar if i said that Tolkiens world

interested me all that much,and an even bigger liar if i said that I was able to keep up with all of it. However i think the beauty of Peter Jacksons films were that everyone was able to appreciate the vastness and complexities of this world created in the books.

There is certainly no doubt in my mind that these films are an extraordinary achievment,whether I connect with them or not.

The final chapter of the trilogy is ,fittingly,the biggest and best,and represents everything that has made these films special to fans. In almost every way,Peter Jackson reinvents the limitations of modern cinema in this film. Consider the excitement and horror the film generates,the world and battles it creates, toppling anything we could ever make up in our head.

Dont forget the drama. The emotional,moving outcomes of these character's fight against this evil of middle earth. No other film has made better use of CGI and natural scenery,delivering a gorgeous spectacle through brilliant cinematography and direction. No other film this century thus far has captured an audiences imagination like this one.

Well guess what? It's called ARTISTIC LICENSE. Some things that work beautifully (and they do, most definitely) in a book just can't happen on the screen. I love LOTR, I'm obsessed with it, I've got the One Ring around my neck right now, I can relate anything to LOTR, etc., but I'm not so uptight as to squash the fun out of anything that isn't purely and completely Tolkien. Such additions to the story as the Drinking Game between Legolas and Gimli are simply amusements which spark wonderful inside jokes.

But now I do have to say some bad things. I was pretty disappointed with the Houses of Healing scenes, they weren't long enough and didn't show much. But the important thing is that they didn't affect the movie overall.
I was also disappointed with the scene at the beginning with Saruman. I loved the fact that most of the dialogue (up to a certain point) was straight from the books, but the way it was acted seemed almost fake. I can see why this scene was originally left out.

Instead, the return to the Shire was twenty more minutes of men getting weepy over each other which was painfully boring after 12 hours of such strained posturing and bluster, and Mr. Jackson's most serious editing error.

The emotional content of the entire work ultimately seemed somewhat unconvincing and contrived. In the end, the movie remains only a good-looking substitute for the rich and highly imaginative books, and Gollum emerges as the most sincere and gripping character of all.",1129507200,3,736,5.125
7274184,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"As an avid reader, I am virtually always terribly disappointed in the movie version of a book I enjoyed.  This is an exception, and since LOTR is up there with favorite books of all time, this was wonderful to experience.

The changes from the book were few and (I felt) warranted.  Taking out the Tom Bombadil part worked for me.  Tom Bombadil is his own story, and LOTR did not suffer from his absence.  The only problem left from taking him out was getting swords to the hobbits.  It was taken care of in a rather clinical way on Weathertop by Strider. Bombadil was ""chaff"" as compared to the rest of the story.  Killing Saruman in The Two Towers removed the necessity for the last part of ROTK, where the hobbits return to see the Shire decimated by him (but it messed up Sam's gift, I could accept that, too, as necessary) and must regain it.  I think that part was depressing, and although it was fine in the book, too much time in the movie would have had to have been devoted to this part, which occurred after the main story was completed.  So I applaud taking that part out.

Arwen's part in saving the injured Frodo from the black riders was added, but since Arwen's part in the books was not extensive, I can appreciate them putting more of Liv Tyler in the movie.

Due to the length of each movie, there simply was not enough time to leave the omitted parts in - the essential parts remained.

Having Eowyn receive Theoden's dying words rather than Merry...minor.

A miraculous rendition of Tolkiens masterpieces!

I have never enjoyed any movies so much.

Some movies get re-made years later.  I think these will not.

The casting was perfect, the acting quite good, the scenery breathtaking, and the story first-rate.  Tolkien would definitely approve!

Sadly the dreadful and almost non-existent villian Sauron ruins any sense of greatness that the film might have had. A pathetic eye on a stick is hardly impressive and the whole notion of the ring being such a threat is laughable. The Lord of the Rings can't compare to modern fantasy, and that's a shame.

 There is also alot of hammy dialogue, with some un-called for sad music that play almost on queue like a soap opera. You can't fault the beautiful CGI or the impressive sets, but it's all so much gloss that fails to cover the hollow heart of the final film.

 Also Gandalf is probably the worst magician in cinema history, even harry potter seems to know more spells than he does. It's almost cringe worthy to watch him posture and grandstand then let off a little puff of magic.

 The ending is dreadfully slow and boring and shows Jackson doesn't know when to quit.

7274192,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I think this is the best of the three installments of Lord of the Rings.  Everything comes to its conclusion in this one, there are great fight scenes and personal scenes as well.

There is even some humor in this one.  One moment had me roaring, regarding the competition between Gimli and Legolas to see which would kill more enemies in battle, when Legolas mounts an attacking giant Oliphaunt and takes it down, killing it, and Gimli sullenly and competitively blurts out ""that counts as only one!"".  It's great comic relief, and of course you have to see it to appreciate it because it isn't funny in the telling.

There is a lot of emotion between the characters.  Sam in particular is very emotional, and his scenes with Frodo are sure to water your eyes.  Sam comes off as a greater hero than Frodo.  Near the end, when all the characters make an appearance at Frodo's bedside in what appears to be a theatrical final bow, Sam's appearance is the final one, the one reserved for the star.

This has to be listed among the greatest movies of all time.  But I refuse to give any movie a rave review without at least mentioning some area for improvement.  I hate rave reviews that have nothing to suggest as an improvement.

One thing I would ask is complete faithfulness to the book.  That wasn't done in this series.  A few changes were made.  I wouldn't have made any.

It's hard for me to come up with anything else.  This is a thoroughly enjoyable film.  I've already said, in my review of Fellowship of the Ring, that the elves are too tall, leaving the dwarves as the only small race, when Tolkien had the elves probably lighter in weight than the dwarves, and only inches taller.  Gimli was supposed to be stronger than Legolas.  The whole size scale was off quite a bit.  Men were supposed to be significantly larger than elves and orcs.

I don't object to the movie leaving out the whole final section about the hobbits returning to the Shire and having to battle Saruman once again.  That would have added a half hour to the film, and it was long enough as is.  But still, it would have been very interesting to see that final chapter, when Merry and the other hobbits became military heroes at home.  It was Merry's only real time to shine, aside from when he helped Eowyn take down the leader of the ringwraiths.

I liked their decision to show Gollum as a young hobbit taking the ring from his brother.  I suppose that was more important than showing the returning hobbits retake the Shire from Saruman.  Still, I'm not totally comfortable with leaving out the military heroism of the hobbits vs. Saruman.

Another thing I'm sorry to have missed is the story of Tom Bombadil, the most interesting character in the book of all the characters who were left out of the movie.  A true film document of LOTR would have to include Tom Bombadil, an unforgettable character.  He's the oldest character in Middle Earth, and the only one who can actually put on the ring of power without disappearing.  The ring has absolutely no influence on him.  He toys with it early in the book.  He's the one character Sauron never could have subdued, even if Sauron regained the ring and took control of Middle Earth.

Now I have to go back and read the books - again.

LOTR was written by an Englishman during the darkest years of the 20th Century, inspired by the rise of our own Sauron, Germany's Hitler.  I wonder if it was of hidden significance that in the final battle scenes the eagles make an appearance and take on the ringwraiths.  I wonder if Tolkien saw, in the eagles, the appearance of the USA to take on Hitler's ringwraiths.

I see Lord of the Rings as a fantasy version of World War Two, and I think Tolkien did too.  That's when it was written.

One last comment.  Frodo failed.  Yet he was still a hero.  I like that.  We all fail.  The fact that Frodo failed to destroy the ring, failed the test that Galadriel and Gandalf passed when they gave up the offer of the ring, really taints him as a hero.  He was a failure.  But still he is appreciated and treated as a hero for the successes he had along the way, despite his ultimate failure when the chips were down.  That's nice to know.  We may mess up in some really big ways, but we can still be appreciated for the things we managed to do right.  It's a comforting thought.  God knows we need someone to cut us some slack in heaven when our lives are reviewed.",1128124800,6,4432,4.44223602484472

7274206,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Someone-and I forget who, but I know it's been said- said that a great movie must have three great scenes and no bad ones. This seems like a fair statement and a good system of measurement to me. That being said, The Return of the King is a great movie. Not because it has three great scenes and no bad ones, but rather because it has about ten great scenes and no bad ones.

  I loved this movie. I can remember back to when I was 16 years old (so long ago :p) sitting in the theater with a few hundred others, watching this movie, soaking it in, and loving every minute of it. I loved it! Loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it. It exceeded my expectations. Heck,it demolished my expectations and built a whole new set. There were so many things that I loved about this film, I can't even go into detail about it, because it would be incredibly boring for you, the person reading this. However, let me say this: The Return of the King is my favorite film.

  Why?

  Because of the emotional punch it has. Because of the depictions of heroism and sacrifice. Because Sam carries Frodo to the top of Mount Doom, and because Merry rides into battle certain he's going to his death. ""Sure"" you say, ""but I've seen dozens of movies like that."" Yeah, and they all come off as incredibly cheesy. But this one doesn't.

  Think about the scene in which King Theoden leads his riders into battle, with them all-bravely and guilessly- shouting ""Death!"" as if it were the greatest honor they could achieve. There's something about that scene, when the music rises, and the men, the niece, and the hobbit, all shout the praises of their battle, that just sends shivers up your spine. And, in my case, tears to your eyes.

  But I can't prove my point by eluding to scenes. I can't prove my point to you at all. Not until you watch it for yourself. I can only encourage you, to plead with you, to watch it. If you haven't seen it, go see it now. If you're a fan of the imagination; of themes of sacrifice, loyalty, bravery, heartbrack, loss, redemption, you will love this movie.

Its the best movie I have  ever seen. Im a BIG fan of the movies and a big fan of the books, and I was very sad to see these movies come to and end. These are movies that inspired me to go to Film School. The 50 mintues of Extra footage in the movies are amazing. I still feel the film is a little short. LOL. I wish it could have been 5 hours long instead of 4 hours and 10 minutes.

I love these new scenes the most

1. The Decline of Gondor - This is a very good scene with Gandalf telling Pippin all about the history of the Gondorians and the White Tree of Gondor, and how the Gondorian Kingdom has declined  since it has been a Kingless country.

2. The Road To Isengard - This is nice little sequence that shows the end of Saruman the White. And the last confrontation between Saruman and the Fellowship is very good.

They Could Have Added More Footage To...

1. The Siege Of Gondor - I feel this battle is still a little short even with the extra footage.

2. Breaking The Gate Of Gondor - It needs more footage.

3. The Witch-Kings Hour - could of had more talking between Gandalf and the Witch-King.

4. The Battle Of Pelennor Fields - This could have had a whole lot more footage...I mean it is suppose to be the Greatest Battle of the 3rd Age

5. Victory At Minas Tirtih - This should of had more footage in it.

6. The Fight outside the Black Gate should have had more footage

7. Return To Edoras - should have had more footage

8. The Return Of the King - could of possibly had a little bit more added to it.

9. I think the should have added more footage to the end of the movie. They should have showed what happened to Legolas and Gimli

BUT OVERALL this is the most amazing movie. The years of work the cast and crew put into these films really payed off. They deserved to win all 11 Oscars.

7274213,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The third Lord of the Rings film is better than the first two, and is a joy to watch.  It somehow manages to avoid the mistakes of the previous two films and, in fact, succeeds despite the errors inherited from the first two that could easily have sunk it.  Peter Jackson's mistake in the Lord of the Rings trilogy was to try to include too much of the books.  In Fellowship, for example, the crossing of the Pass at Carhadras should have been cut.  In Two Towers, the Battle of Helm's Deep, while impressive, does nothing to advance the story.  Because of these slow-downs, something like 1/4 of Two Towers had not been told yet - and they were essential parts of Frodo and Sam's journey into Mordor.

Fortunately, Return of the King is a smooth and simple story.  Only 3 things happen: 1. The Battle of Pelennor Fields, where the men and orcs fight it out for control of Minas Tirith. 2. Aragorn, Eomer, and Gandalf lead an army into Mordor to distract Sauron from ... 3. Sam and Frodo trying to get to Mount Doom to destroy the ring.  There are no side battles.  There are no extraneous dream sequences that don't even appear in the book.  Extra characters are ruthlessly cut.  If Jackson does allow the end to spin out for far too long - the departure of the Elves from Middle Earth is irrelevant to the main story and is probably confusing to the casual viewer - he is still better than Tolkien himself.  Jackson heroically manages to cut most of the last 100 pages of Tolkien's narrative that added little to the main story.

Because the same care and attention to detail is brought to this film that were brought to the first two, and because the script is better, the film transcends its genre into greatness (and was appropriately awarded 11 Academy Awards, only half of which were in technical categories).  The Battle of Pelennor Fields is possibly the single greatest cinematic achievement since the beginning of the CGI era (including Star Wars Ep. III).  Seamlessly combining 150 live horses and riders with 6000 computer-generated ones would be difficult enough, but the addition of the completely computer-generated Oiphants in Sauron's army was a recipe for potential disaster.  Instead, the sequence is exciting, immersing, and even ""realistic."" (I know, as does every calvary rider since Alexander, that real horses won't run over people, but maybe Middle Earth horses behave differently - the sound and visual effects totally sell the realism of the battle.)

Jackson effectively keeps alive the Frodo/Sam storyline, which could have been very dull.  But their personal battles (Sam's with Shelob - one of the leftovers from Two Towers), Frodo's capture by Orcs, Frodo's fight with Gollum) are small and contrast nicely with the big doings of Aragorn's armies.  Through all the action, the humanity of the characters still shines through (as Tolkien would require).  The actors are universally good - inspiring, overawed, and moving as required.  The effects are outstanding, the sound editing seamless, and the musical score very effective (without the cloying melodies that plagued Two Towers).  If the undead Oathbreakers look similar to the Pirates of the Caribbean, it's purely coincidence.

Fans of the book will naturally bemoan some omissions and reinterpretations - especially among fan favourite characters.  Wormtongue's end comes in the first reel, not in the last pages of the book.  The sons of Elrond are absent, as are the Dunedain, as are the Woses (the Wild Men of Rohan).  The entire subplot of ambitious and unscrupulous Hobbits taking over Bag End and Hobbiton was similarly cut.  Gollum's fate is altered (although Jackson is right - the way it's described in the book is unfilmable).  All these changes are necessary - to include them would only have added to the already overlarge cast of characters (it was already difficult enough to keep Faramir and Eomer straight!).  I, for one, have never forgiven Jackson for cutting the Barrow Wights from the first film, but certain sacrifices had to be made, and these cuts are all logical in the final analysis of the film as a stand-alone piece.  Again, Jackson could have cut more - especially the departure of the Elves, as I mentioned above - but overall the excess amounts to little more than 15 minutes out of the 4-hour running time of this special-edition cut.

The extras are, as with the previous two Special Edition DVD's, very thorough and enjoyable to watch.  There is virtually no overlap within the special features for this film, nor between the special features of this film and those previous.  There is some repetition between the special features and the audio commentaries, but you can hardly count that - there are 4 commentaries and the people have to talk about something for the 4 hours!  Certainly, this DVD box set is worth the cost, both for the film itself and the myriad special features.",1123977600,,4906,4.864019253910951
7274214,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"It goes without saying that this movie was fantastic to begin with. The classic Tolkien story brought to life, with great special effects, costumes and filmwork. The Platinum Series Special Edition has a substantial amount of added footage, as well as more than one evening's worth of documentaries and ""behind the scenes"" features by themselves, which are almost all fantastic to see.

Granted, watching an almost FOUR hour film, when all is said and done, is an undertaking in and of itself (which is why I also have the original ""shorter"" version, a mere ...3 hours). So unless you want to invest the time, you may have the stamina to watch this extended version only once.

If you are a die hard LotR fan, you probably already have this anyway. It's well worth buying, as well as the other two films in the trilogy...",1123804800,,821,4.694444444444445
7274215,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"The third and last part of the LOTR Trilogy is the end set of this huge and massive movie divided into 3 sections. I watched all 3 movies in the theater and have only rented the first for home viewing as it is my favorite of the 3. The other two weren't as good for a few reasons of my own if not for some others as well. What I thought funny was that they released each one through a setted time period, each one a year or so apart, even though all 3 were already finished from the beginning from what I heard.

The movie opens up as the continue of the Two Towers(Part 2) where Frodo and Sam(short for Samwise), played by Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, are both being led quite blindly by Gollum(Andy Serkis) into the very intricate lair of Shelob, a monsterous, giant, ancient arachnid-type monster that lurked at the stairways to the firey mountains of Mt. Doom, eating almost anything that might pass along her way, even the orcs(indigestions...use pepto :P ). Of course I'm not here to ruin the movie for those of you that haven't watched it so the rest is for you to find out.

The problem that I saw with this movie, if most of you haven't noticed, is the shallowness of the film. Its depth and heart isn't as strong as the first and in my opinion has lost it since around the period of the second part of this trilogy, the Two Towers. Pictures, sounds, acting, and directing were all good don't get me wrong. The flaw I saw(rhymes) I guess came first from the book itself as this movie was book based. I felt that the movie had good action and once again a whole lot of graphically generated armies of soldiers and orcs and others at war, but what made it demeaning is the thought in my head ""wow...this again?"" In other words, I thought the battle was a cheap way of impressing the audience. It was pretty much the same as the one in the Two Towers in the fact that it showed two massive armies of the so called ""good and bad"" slamming into each other in the havoc of war and bloodlust. After viewing so many films, I'm more impressed by the quality of the fight than the numbers in it. Once again, you see the same kind of fighting technique, Legolas(Orlando Bloom) shooting his arrows at the orcs and Gimli(John Rhys-Davies) chopping away. Its boring after the second or third time around.

Throughout the second part and this, I felt like they were rushing through the movie a little too much. I mean have you seen the whole book? I've read the whole thing and wow is it boring. Its huge, even with 3 hours you cannot possibly fit so much into 3 or so hours. The problem wasn't the one fact that they missed some scenes that the book had but movie didn't, it was the fact that they missed the dramatic moments that made LOTR...LOTR. Movies like this should not be rushed. This was another reason why I didn't like the Two Towers much, but loved the first one. I just didn't feel the same soul in the movie as I once did in the beginning. Again I don't want to ruin the movie, if the others haven't already, so you'll just have to watch to find out what I mean.

The biggest problem I had was the horribly elongated ending. I know its in the book, but wow!! I know I wasn't the only one in the theater that was saying ""END IT ALREADY"" or ""WHY IS IT STILL GOING?"" I was shaking my head slightly throughout the whole period and people were sort of giving each other awkward looks that have a question mark written all over it. They should definately do something about it.

That done, there are a few minor problems, but nothing else to be note-worthy. Most people who start watching LOTR should minus well finish it. This movie isn't the kind of ending I was hoping, but I suppose it was satisfactory in the most part. Watch it anyways. Good day everyone.

7274230,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"I finally watched Return Of The King tonight. I was very let down. I enjoyed the first two Lord Of The Rings films, although I didn't think they were amazing by any means, but still really good films. After having a discussion with some friends last night about film and one of them telling me that Return Of The King was the greatest movie he'd ever seen (in front of the first 2 Godfather films, Shawshank Redemption, and Schindler's List - 4 great films), I decided I would finally watch Return Of The King.

I thought it was merely okay. There were numerous things I didn't like about it:

: The multiple endings - it just kept GOING and GOING. After the climax you don't need a 30-minute resolution. That's overkill and something you learn in any scriptwriting class. My brother told me that they did that because the books follow the same structure. I don't think that iss any reason to put that lengthy of a resolution in the film. If you've read the books, you know what happens after that. If you haven't, then you probably don't care to watch that much aftermath. I thought it was boring and dumb.

: Pippin and Merry, especially Pippin. Jesus, what an annoying person. And why in the hell is a male hobbit named Merry? Every time his name was mentioned I cringed on the inside.

: I thought the dialogue was poor overall.

: Sean Astin isn't a very good actor. I don't think he delivered his lines very well at all.

: The ""well-placed"" / ""tension breaking"" humor. I didn't think it was well-placed, nor did I think it was humorous. In fact, I think a movie like this has no room for little one-liners. It's an adventure/action/fantasty film, not a dramatic comedy.

There were some things I did like, though:

: The battle scenes were very nice and pretty intense (but Ii thought some of the CG camera angle choices were poor).

: The FX/CG were very well-done, but I think the CG was overused. I felt like I was watching a video game demo for about 50% of the film.

Overall, I was disappointed. I can't say I would recommend this film based on the quality alone, but I would have to recommend it to pretty much anyone because the film is technically well-made, and it's one of those films that you kinda have to have an opinion on to be taken seriously in a film discussion. But, it is possibly the most overrated film I've ever seen.",1121040000,2,2348,4.426914153132251
7274231,5,B00Z9YZRVE,Loved every minute of this set.  Especially the off camera scenes.  They were outstanding.,1120694400,6,90,5.357142857142857
7274232,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the greatest of the great and is the most spectacular project ever made into a motion picture. To see the entire four hours plus that this portion of the LOTR extended series supplies is time well spent.

Again, this is not just another great movie. It is visually stunning and well crafted, but it is also a thinking person's movie.

Upon looking at the extended version, one might come to view the story in more highly metaphoric terms, especially in a day and age where the attainment of a goal is often difficult and the guidelines for achievement are increasingly called into question. In other words, one might come to ask, ""In order to arrive to the solution, is there a 'My Precious!' in my life that I must give up, even if it is beautiful, and if so, what or where is the path to my Mordor that must be undertaken? And who would be the Sauron in this case?""

Those questions could possibly have been asked after watching Fellowship and Two Towers, but Return of the King sheds a whole new light on the subject matter. Like the theatrical release from the year before, it is, indeed, a crowned jewel.

Five unanimous stars for this masterpiece.",1119916800,11,1202,4.474885844748859
7274233,1,B00Z9YZRVE,"Craptacular and boring. The cinematography and special effects are well done but the story is dullsville. And what is up with everyone who is claiming that 'Rudy' is such a great actor? All he did was act tired - WOW give him the Oscar now.

I have no idea why these films or books are so popular... are people that disillusioned with life that they need hobbits and dragons to make themselves feel good? I don't care that it took 25 years or whatever to make these films and Peter Jackson is regarded as a genius. This film is boring and lame - just like the first two movies. And it's also non-sensical, case in point: the flying dragon things and the super tough mean guy were supposedly the toughest, meanest things in the whole world. Well some chick kills the dragon in like 2 seconds and the tough guy in like 3 seconds. WHY? The movie doesn't explain at all how the good guys are suddenly all-powerful and can't be defeated.

U have an extended cut with lot's of extra scenes, and the appandices tell you everything and i mean everything!!! From how the swords were made to how billy kissed 5 guys on the set :) lol

The feeling i got from watching all of this is wow!! I felt i was in the movie, really in it! Checking out all the art departments, weaponry take sword lessons, simply put amazing!!!

There are also other small extras like docu's that were made as inspiration by others which really bring a tear to ur eye.

7274235,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of ""Lord of the Rings"" reaches its pinnacle in ""Return of the King."" The stellar cast, mind-blowing special effects and heartbreaking script are all present in the third movie, which is not only the last of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, but the best.

Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still following the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the path to Mordor, with the increasingly strained Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realizes his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel...

Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. \Not only is the city under siege, but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his one remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the dead won't help him if Frodo doesn't destroy the Ring...

The ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess.

Peter Jackson really outdoes himself. You know those battle scenes in ""Two Towers"" and ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" with the swooping camera and thousands of orcs, clashing with men on a gloomy battlefield? In ""Return of the King,"" Jackson surpasses that. There's everything from volcanic eruptions to an invasion of howling ghosts to the attack of the oliphaunts (like elephants, only bigger). Each action scene a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't.

But if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. They cry, they hug, they think about home -- such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into equally rich movie dialogue.

Elijah Wood gives an unparalleled performance as Frodo Baggins. Frodo's gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the ""strong"" hobbit, rather than the follower. The final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated.

But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, and the ""I'm going to take care of you"" scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Mortensen gets more kingly every moment, while Ian McKellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom. Bernard Hill has a quietly moving final scene, while Miranda Otto makes the despairing Eowyn a strong, kick-butt heroine.

Perhaps the most striking thing about ""Return of the King"" is the final fourth of the film. While the ""multiple endings"" may annoy some viewers, it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden, splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending, Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron.

""Return of the King"" brings the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy to a close, and cements Jackson's reputation as a master filmmaker. With the outstanding cast, beautiful scripting and amazing direction, this is the best of the ""Lord"" films -- and that's saying something.",1118620800,6,4301,5.021037868162693
7274236,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"I may be the odd one out, but I liked the theatrical version somewhat better. Despite choppy edits in the TE, it wasn't as rushed or harried as this Extended Edition felt. The editing here in the EE is still less than good, compared to the first two EE versions, whose flow created a glorious literary feeling. ROTK-EE chops and jerks from scene to scene and dialogue flow stutters, painfully pointing out that many more scenes in between are absent. It seems the more they added back in, the more we noticed what was still missing.
Instead of a smooth transition and easy flow (like the very nearly flawless FOTR:EE), the scene transitions moved lightning fast - jump jump jump - with no thought given to the poor audience trying to soak up the vast amounts of information and action being chucked our way (wait, please, PJ!! let me revel in that moment!).

While still undoubtedly the finest treatment of Tolkien's masterpiece, Jackson gives us both an achingly gorgeous creation, unfortunately mixed with a few frustrating deviations.
 The wonderful Healing scenes were ""blink- oops you missed them"" fast and the  development of the beautiful, pure and innocent relationship between Faramir & Eowyn cut short, if not cut off (though the feeling of innocence remains). The healing of Eowyn - cut to exactly 1:30 minutes. The healing of Faramir? Non-existent. And the ad nauseam additional scenes of Gollum could easily have been left out. The whole ""Smeagol lied!"" bit made me want to puke. By the time they reached Mt. Doom I'd so had it with Gollum I could have killed myself. PJ really over emphasized his character and it seemed like he was rubbing it in our faces at this point.
 It's a dream come true to see the novel realized, and many of the added scenes were glorious, don't get me wrong, but it certainly felt like PJ just THREW in the other scenes (some, badly-chosen) to satisfy his eager audience in order to call it an ""Extended Edition"".
Some were downright amazing: the resolution of Saruman - With the hectic and sometimes tedious pace of the battle scenes to follow this confrontation is actually a nice breather! Merry's monologue to Eowyn was very lovely. I really love the little touches like these that PJ added back in. I loved the addition of Eomer finding his sister on the battlefield along with the transition into the Houses of Healing when we see Aragorn healing Eowyn, but again, it was cut down too much.
The problem of omitting the majority of Eowyn & Faramir's relationship is that it makes the whole building up of Eowyn & Aragorn utterly useless. If you're not going to have a resolution to previous areas of the plot, don't over-emphasize it in the first place.
 To leave out the resolution of these ""other"" characters cuts into the dignity of PJ's hard work. I was angry to get more Gollum and more of ""Gandalf explains to Aragorn what to do"" and less of these ""minor character"" development scenes. Peter Jackson in adapting, of course, had to change many points of view to better develop his characters for those unfamiliar with the books, but he seems to have tried too hard to TELL, instead of show. Things were spelled out and dumbed down a little too much, creating too much unnecessary repetition. Things weren't as bad here as they were in TTT:EE (""Sauron is using his puppet Saruman to destroy Middle Earth"" or the like, was said no less than THREE times!).
Also, cutting into the dignity of the film is humor applied at inappropriate places, such as Gimli continuously being the butt of jokes. It seems that Jackson had nothing better to do with this character - and especially Legolas's - and changed their relationship entirely, giving them a more ""modern"", bantering relationship. When watching some of Gimli's scenes, I was pained that PJ wrote such things into his script. A little more restraint would have been better, and turning to his original source a wise idea, instead of creating something new to ""please the audience"". The comic relief against the background of the horror of battle is placed by Tolkien in the two young Hobbits, and there it should remain!
Other lackluster points include blase Legolas stunts, the over-dramatising of Aragorn's destiny (just get on with it!), and the lack of explaining Denethor's madness (a 30-second explanation is so easy: show him whipping out a Palantir, explains the ""I have seen much"" hint and boom!, madness explained away and potentially forgiven). Otherwise, he's just another bastard who favors his older son, dignity compromised. His character is still great, but the Palantir ought to have been included here.
Scenes like ""The Last Debate"" also still continued to slightly disappoint - the lack of other peoples contributing to the final decision to march upon the Black Gate really left me wanting, and really missing Imrahil! He also could have easily been placed into the story and explained in 30 seconds, and his importance created in one line ""this is Faramir's uncle"" generating an ""Ooh! we like Faramir. I bet his uncle is just as spiffy!"" audience response. And, oh, dear LORD, Legolas' ""a diversion"" takes the cake as far as utterly stupid dialogue goes. Oh well.
With the Mouth of Sauron: yes, we all felt like doing that to the MoS, but his trap was so sneaky and dastardly in the book, I was sorry to lose it. It seemed like a cop out.
And WHAT happened to the horses at the Black Gate? PJ's ""additions"" ruined the continuity! He had a wee bit too much fun romping around in Middle Earth and forgot to fix the things he messed with. Makes the fact that ""this is a movie"" all too clear, unfortunately, and sometimes, you really just want to soak in the fantasy!

I still felt like I had ADHD by the time the movie ended. Of course, this doesn't mean that I wasn't bawling like a baby by the end of it, crying because it's over, crying because this film was amazingly glorious, despite its flaws. Good job, overall, Peter Jackson! Whew. What a ride it's been, eh?

Stick around for the hours of extras. They do great justice to PJ's film. The pieces on adapatation & creation, and the bio bit about Tolkien's life particularly are fabulous.",1118534400,13,6163,4.7381174277726

7274239,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"`The Return of the King' is the third movie of the three-volume novel, `Lord of the Rings' by philologist J. R. R. Tolkien. This fiction is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as `Ben-Hur' and `Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script. For starters, `Lord of the Rings' has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid 1950s to the present, while I suspect practically no one reads Lew Wallace's `Ben-Hur' any more and few people have recently read Margaret Mitchell's `Gone With the Wind'. Another `Lord of the Rings' offspring is the whole `Dungeons and Dragons' role playing games phenomenon. This game originally appeared a few years after the second blooming of `Lord of the Rings' popularity in 1965, when the books were published in paperback by Houghton Mifflin in response to a pirated copy published by Ace. This is when I first became enraptured by the stories of Middle Earth.

It is impossible to speak of any one of the three movies as part of a trilogy of three independent works related by common characters, location, and history. `The Lord of the Rings' is a single novel which was serialized in three volumes published over two and a half years in the mid 1950's. When the three titles are published in a single volume, it is not hard to see that the work is really not much longer than `Gone With the Wind' and it is certainly shorter than some notable novels such as `Atlas Shrugged'. One virtue we did get from the division into three titles by Tolkien is that Peter Jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to 10 hours of viewing time.

Like the movie version of `The Fellowship of the Ring', the `Return of the King' movie leaves off some important chapters. And, unlike the Tom Bombadil / Barrow Wight episodes in the first volume, the deleted `Scouring of the Shire' chapter in `Return of the King' created what was virtually the only real criticism of the movie, because the drama of `the scouring' was left out of the events between the celebrations in Gondor over the defeat of Sauron and the departures at the Gray Havens. So, we get a half-hour of celebrating and saying good-bye. Not too much in relation to the previous nine and a half hours, but a bit tedious in the context of a three hour movie. So, for the three of you who are reading the books for the first time, you have a great `lost' event to look forward to in reading `The Fellowship of the King'. As with the earlier two movies, Jackson has actually improved on virtually every scene he has touched. One of the very best scenes from `Lionheart' is Wallace's exhortation to his troops before their most important battle. Jackson has two such scenes in this movie, and each is both more powerful than anything Tolkien put into words and that Mel Gibson put onto the screen.

One of the easily most important parts of the `Return of the King' book is the very long historical appendix which lays out the major events of the first three ages of Middle Earth. One of the most satisfying aspects of both `The Lord of the Rings' movie and book is the sense of the great depth of history. The appendices show that the history of the One Ring just scratches the surface, as Isildur wrested the ring from Sauron (see the opening scene of `Fellowship of the Rings') at the beginning of the Third Age. There are two earlier ages of Middle Earth from the time of the birth of the elves to the end of the first war with Sauron. It is a knowledge of this history which tells us why a ranger from the distant north is an heir to the throne of Gondor and why Denethor, the Steward cannot be King. One thing which amazes me is that no movie reviewer has noted the fact that Arwen and Aragorn are very, very, very distantly removed cousins, since it is quite possible that Elrond was the brother of Aragorn's great,....great grandfather. This is because Elrond and brother Elros Tar-Minyatar were given the choice of immortality as a half-elf or very long life and a homestead on the island of Numenor, removed from the sorrows of Middle Earth. Elrond chose immortality and `exile' to Middle Earth'. Elros chose long life on the Eden-like island. Another thing which seems to have escaped comment is the notion that kingship and right to rule can only pass from parent to child. It is amazing how quietly people accepted this undemocratic notion, although it would have been entirely logical to a mid-20th century Englishman.

This appendix contains a great many other bits of miscellany. The most important for the movie is the story of the love between Arwen and Aragorn, which is not in the main narrative.

This history is easily one of the most elaborate fictional histories created to date. Other fantasy histories such as Robert E. Heinlein's future history (in which he predicts the turmoil of the 1960's with amazing accuracy) is tiny in comparison.

Truly great ending to the greatest fantasy cinema, ever. One of my favorite questions about movie fantasy is musing over what was the second greatest cinematic fantasy after `The Wizard of Oz'. This great ten-hour movie makes that question an almost trivial query about third place.",1115942400,,5354,4.618697478991597
7274240,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I saw Return of the King on opening night and I was blown away by it.  Once again Peter Jackson perfectly captured the spirit of JRR Tolkien's epic trilogy.  The atypical beginning, featuring the origin of Gollum set a very in-depth tone for the movie.  As Frodo and Sam move closer and closer to the fulfillment of the Quest, their friends move to battle the armies of Mordor in the city of Minas Tirith.  As with the other two films in this trilogy, there are moments of great action, high adventure, stunning emotion, fine humor and pure movie magic.  THe lighting of the beacon's is one such moment.  As the theme for Gondor blares, the camera follows the fire as it warns across the country to the kingdom of Rohan.  Merry and Pippin once again add in a more mature humor, while the actors once again give masterful performances.  The battle of Peleanor fields is a great scene filled with fantastic images and high emotion, while it is balanced by a small intimate scene where Gandalf describes the undying realms to Pippin when it appears that they are going to die.  The only problem I really had with the theatrical release was that the palantir in Minas Tirith was overlooked and I felt it would be better if Gollum simply fell over the edge as in the book and not struggle with Frodo.  The ending leaves out scenes from the book where the Shire has to be freed, but the movie does not feel it's loss, and the bittersweet ending is beautiful.  There will never again be movies such as these and I'm glad I was able to witness their brilliance on the theater screen and the dvd releases.",1115510400,2,1596,4.4878892733564015

I first read Lord of the Rings when I was 14 and re-read it every year until I was about 30.  Took a break and then started reading it aloud to my children as a bedtime story.  The movie is so much like the book has been in my mind.

The music fits perfectly.

Now, I'm referring in general to the entire trilogy of movies.  But this last one, the Return of the King, is particularly beautiful and moving.

And as for the model of Minas Tirith, I keep mine on my dresser where I keep my bracelet with elvish engraving.

I could find no fault with anything.  Eowyn in the movie is a little prettier than Eowyn as I imagined her, but that's okay.  Every other character looked as I have imagined for the past almost 40 years.  What a superb accomplishment!  Every actor was fantastic.  Oh, those oliphants!!

Frodo and Sam, well, Elijah Wood was born to play Frodo and Sean Astin, who could do Sam better?

The hobbit hold where Bilbo lives, just like I envisioned.

Although I recognize your right to your opinion, your criticisms of this film echo the criticisms that Tolkien absorbed from the literary guardians of academe in his own time. Witness his professed disdain for the false intellectualism of allegory. He recognized the most important thing about creative writing: to entertain. The same holds for Peter Jackson's achievement in this film. Few authors in modern history held their audience with such rapt attention and provided them with such joy, as did Tolkien, and again, Jackson has enjoyed accomplishment at a similar level with his film. While it is easy for all of us to find niggles we might have done differently, it's hard to imagine anyone having tackled a project of this impossible enormity with any closer proximity to perfection. The achievment nearly defies comprehension. Sorry to gush, but I've seen a lot of movies over lo these many decades, and I studied film in college too, so ""I know what I'm talking about.""

The End is sooooo beautifully filmed! The emotions are at the most highest level! Yes I do want to thank Peter Jackson for this TERRIFIC achievment!",1114300800,7,1103,4.5

Peter Jackson made such a wonderful effort in making the deleted scenes a completely new movie in of themselves, that the new version came out even more epic and exciting than what we originally watched.

Tons of extras, over 3 hours of behind-the-scene features.  The only problem is I think many of the best stories were in the first two sets.  Also the people in the commentaries seem very tired.  Which, is understandable - it seems the closer they got to their deadlines for the third film the more work was placed on them!  That is amazing in itself.  But the fact that they produced such a wonderful piece of art while under such pressure is a sign on just how great the crew was (and still is).

The set get five points because of the blood, sweat and work put into it.  A perfect ending to a great epic.",1113436800,6,744,4.37956204379562
7274249,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"First and foremost, no one has done this before. No one has done this type of movie this well before. So thats five stars from me off the bat. The creatures were incredibly detailed and thats one of the most important of factors when tackling a fantasy film. But darn Peter, darn darn darn, there are things that really annoyed me...

1) There were tons of zoom in close-ups, which would be very
  irritating if one were looking for them. They couldve been
  shot in different ways so easily, but whats done is done.

2) Close-ups were bad enough, but you had to make Billy Boyd be
  the one to say that something cool is going to happen at this
  moment of the movie, and say it in a real high soprana voice?
  ""The trees, the trees! Weeeee! "" ""The eagles, the eagles!
  Weeeee!""

3) The close-up of Cate Blanchett when she boards the ship, why
  was that added in???? Man, why did you let her give that ""hee
  hee Ive got something good to put in your stockings this
  holiday"" smile????? That was just, just, shes beautiful but
  no, never do that again!

4) It was wrong to give John Rhys-Davies 2 voices. Yes he is
  highly talented, but it was so noticible to me. And tree
  beards voice was a tad rip off of Morla from NeverEnding
  Story don't you agree?

5) You should have let Andy Serkis do a ""normal"" voice,
  instead of retaining the Gollum voice for Smeagol. If you
  somehow had inserted a glimpse of Smeagols childhood where
  he inhaled helium so much one day that he got stuck like
  that for the rest of his life, then it would be ok. But,
  alas, no. You showed the whole transformation sequence, the
  voice shouldve been transforming too.

6) Ok this is the worst edition to the extended version of ROTK.
  At hells gate, the horsed representative of Sauron...That
  mouth was just ridiculous. The character, was just stupid.
  No wonder his head was chopped off, he was just so annoying
  as the intimidation he wished he wouldve had on other
  people in the movie. At every, single, area, of that scene,
  was a turn of his head, cut back to a hobbit, a turn of
  the creatures head and stupid grunt, cut back to good team
  member, etc. you know? Poor and weak scene. Stupid character.

Peter Jackson, you are incredible for doing this and I still watch your DVDs (extended) on occasion. But if you make another, if any director who is shivering in their boots to do a fantasy cuz they might not live up to the greatness of LOTR, please, PLEASE just heed my warnings posted here. Thank you :)

PS- those directors shouldnt shiver, but get the balls to do their own realistic quality of a creature or landscape. But now, it has to be equal to or greater than LOTRs set design/art/ makeup people.",1113264000,5,2719,4.391480730223123
7274250,5,B00Z9YZRVE,I've watched the extended version almost every month and still it doesn't ceases to amaze me! In fact I got all the extended LOTR but the first two doesn't even comes close to the Return of the King partly because as we all have been informed director Peter Jackson didn't just incorporated additional scenes and material to it but approached it as if he was creating the movie all over again.,1113177600,2,393,4.549295774647887

7274252,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Those little creatures with the little furry feet save the day in this final film of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  This movie was my favorite of the three, The Two Towers my least favorite, The Fellowship of the Ring my second favorite.  (The timing of the release of The Two Towers kind of gave me the creeps).  This film was meant to be the grand finale, and Peter Jackson, the Academy winner in 2003, pulled it off.  The supplemental dvd explains a little about the behind the scenes work that went on and explains how faithfully Peter Jackson tried to create the story as the book describes it.  I read the entire trilogy as a child when I was 10 or so years old, (a long time ago)!  Haven't read it since, yet as I watched the whole series, I began to remember how I had pictured the story in my mind as I had read it decades ago and began to recall (vaguely) what I had read.  I think that's a testimony, to me at least, of Jackson's work.  (I don't recall the Aragorn/Arwen love story at all; I think Jackson just threw that whole thing in the trilogy to spice things up a bit!)  As much as I love watching Orlando and Viggo, this movie to me was a movie about hobbit heroism, and I loved watching the close friendship that had to develop between the hobbit foursome during this perilous quest especially in this last film.  None of the actors got any awards for this movie, yet nearly all the behind the scenes crew did.  Jackson did a spectacular job all around, and was very careful in picking a cast that would work well together during the 3-4 years it took to complete the Trilogy filming.  The Lord of the Rings was written by J. R. R. Tolkien, published in 1954.  What I loved about reading the trilogy, was how Tolkien portrayed good and evil throughout the work.  The story, yes, and especially in The Return of the King, is about the battle between good and evil, the hobbits, the elves, and humans versus Sauron and his evil band, yet there is evil within the heart of everyone as Frodo (Elijah Wood) must grapple with the ring's power to stir up this covetous/idolatrous character flaw within us all.  It's no wonder that Tolkien was raised christian, and this constant inner battle is analogous to the working of the Holy Spirit, the process of sanctification, within those who have given their lives to Christ.  I was on the edge of my seat during the final battle scene, nearly moved to tears.  My favorite scene was the one where Pippin (Billy Boyd) sings a song a capella whilst the battle rages.  No one ever mentions that scene or his singing, but I was really moved by it.  So many of the actors were not top billing in any movies before The Lord of the Rings, but they all performed so well.  Would that these furry-feeted people really existed, would that the world resembled the hobbits' shire.",1113091200,2,2827,4.410404624277457
7274253,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The final and last installement to this epic adventure that Peter Jackson had the good grace to make. Like the two proceeding it, Return of the King has awesome battles, wonderful music, and the end to an evil nemesis that plagued Middle Earth for so long.

Return of the King made me wish that it was not the ending, but rather the beginning, its just so darn cool. Its not everyone that can make three movies so wonderful without losing focus on what the books where about. But Peter Jackson is definatly a master of the cinema. If you already haven't seen this movie in theaters, don't delay any longer and try to watch this on DVD. Although I gurantee that the experience will not be the same.",1112745600,4,697,4.4453125

Doesn't get any better than that. and all of them are over 2 1/2 hours. PERFECT JUST PERFECT. I have completely fallen in love with this story. Sure i hear people complain that it didn't follow the true story acuratly but come on guys, it is a translation from book to film just be glad that it came out as good as it did, it could have came out just horrible but PETER JACKSON DID THE ABSOLUTE BEST JOB HE COULD HAVE DONE WITH THE STORY. I think that the movie did some things better than the book and the book did many things better than the film. I still think that the book is better than the film but for a film it is the best movie i have ever seen period, OR WILL PROBABLY EVER SEE FOR A LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG TIME.

7274255,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"There are several categories of people who will view this DVD.  A group that will hate all the battles, the kind of heroic / fantasy / mythic dialogue, and find all the CGI distracting.  On the other extreme another group will hate the idea of any version of ""Lord of the Rings"" in a movie.  A larger middle group will be made of folks who love the books, have never read the books, don't care about the books, but will enjoy the sweep and amazing scale of this movie.

I fall into the category of one who loved the books when I was a young man, but am not too upset about the compromises that have to be made to make them into a movie.  Given the constraints of time (even in the extended edition), choices have to be made.  I think the moviemakers have been very generous and that Peter Jackson has held the whole production to a high vision of the work.  The technical achievements in this movie are stunning.  How much they succeeded is a matter of taste.  Apparently most people feel this was a terrific movie and a terrific trilogy.  It is light years beyond all the other previous and partial attempts.

Frankly, for me, it is the story of Sam that is the real beauty of the story.  Frodo is almost trapped in being a hero because the story requires it.  But Sam has to choose to stay with Frodo and do the things he does.  Sean Astin is superb in the role.  I don't want to take anything away from any of the other actors.  Really, I think they are all very fine.  It is just my affection for the role of Sam from the time I read the books and the way Mr. Astin brought him to life in the film that have just a bit of a special glow.

Some prefer the theatrical releases and some hate the extended releases.  I love the extended releases because it is such a huge story that I enjoy the luxury of all the extra scenes.

The DVD extras are amazing in themselves.  We get to see hours and hours on how the story was put together, the special effects, the acting, the dramatic choices in the ordering and telling of the story, the music, the sound, the everything.  There is also a nice piece on an amazingly talented 16 year old filmmaker from New Zealand named Cameron Duncan who became involved in PSA the filmmakers were trying to do.

Unfortunately, this very talented young man was struck down by cancer despite a valiant fight.  The DVD has a few of his small films.  They are quite remarkable.  Cameron was the inspiration to the song used for the Grey Havens sequence that Annie Lennox sang.

I think this movie is a tremendous achievement and wish my father, who also loved the story, could have lived to see it.  He would have loved it even more than I.",1112140800,7,2669,4.273453093812376

Allthough there are are some god new scenes in here.  They did something they did not do with the firs 2 special editions. Unlike the first 2 not all the scenes from the theatherical version were left on the dvd.

Some of the scenes like the scene with Elaron and  Aragon in the camp at night when Aragon reaciecvs the reforged sword that was used by Isilador in the great battle was cut out.

Another scene that was cut out that I considered vitially important is the scene when Golloum frames Sam and he and Frodo briefly turns on him.

Other than some of the scenes from the theatherical and widescream missing it was perfect.  If you are a extreme Tolkien fame I recomend you she the other two extend version and the original animated  version of return of the  king.

7274257,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"I could accept the minor changes in the previous movies to exaggerate the importance of Arwen.  But in ""Return of the King,"" Gandalf's role became laughable.  He is riddled with doubt and insecurity - the director claims this was necessary to bring out the importance of Aragorn's role - but then, Aragorn's role wasn't developed all that well, either.

The sappiness of Arwen fading, nearing death, with her survival linked to the defeat of Sauron... It's like they're trying the ""I do believe in fairies (clap, clap, clap)"" ploy from Peter Pan to emotionally involve you.  It just doesn't belong in the movie.

""The Lord of the Rings"" books were a strong enough series, and the characters were so well developed that you feel you know them.  The first two movies of the series were very true to the books.  They should have kept this same strategy for the final movie, and left the characters as Mr. Tolkien intended them to be.",1111536000,8,930,4.703703703703703
7274258,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"In that last installment of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings saga, director Peter Jackson has crafted a cinematic masterpiece that makes for a triumphant end to a legendary film series.

  Every aspect of the series has improved but it improves in a way that doesn't upstage the first two films. The story has gradually become more compelling in part because the audience doesn't have to deal with ""to be continued"". Also the special effect have reached a critical mass that will amaze anyone especially in the epic battle sequenc of Minas Tirith. Each of the characters have also reached a deeper level of depth. Even the usually bumbling Pippin and Merry mature as the evil force of Sauron draws near.

  Overall this film will find its place in our history as being one of the greatest film epics of all time. It is a movie that doesn't reflect the times we are living in now, but instead reminds us of the smaller things in life, despite the grand scope of the film. I think that this movie should be viewed by everyone, but mostly those who have already seen the first two films. I enjoyed it without watching The Fellowship of the Ring or The Two Towers but looking back I wish I had seen the first installments prior to going to the theatre.

7274265,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The extended edition of The Return of the King does as its predecessors and gives a new level of flow to an already wonderful movie.  The Return of the King is a masterpiece in adapted storyline writing.  Since it is adapted, it has its shortcomings when compared to J.R.R. Tolkien's grand epic.  Nevertheless, it is important to bear in mind that this work is primarily an adaptation according to the minds of Peter Jackson et al.

Firstly, I would like to address the issues that are often expressed by fans about the changes made by Jackson.  They are indeed more evident in the extended edition (by its temporally longer nature).  Indeed, I must admit that it disappoints me that the writers thought their own ideas were more suitable than those of J.R.R. Tolkien.  Nevertheless, since this is their adaptation and they are movie writers, they made the choices they deemed necessary to convey the story to the movie-going public.  Since they didn't destroy huge portions of the story, I will let it be even though I do not believe that they needed to change all that they did.

With that having been said, this massive project is one of the most emotionally stirring movies that I have ever seen.  It is a testimony to the work done by the entire cast and crew that I was nearly in tears not only when the Hobbits are honored in the end by Aragorn but even when the Rohirrim rode into battle.  Watching the movie is more like experiencing one long chill of anticipation and awe, even though I have read The Lord of the Rings multiple times.

Because of the added footage, the movie flows better than the original theatrical version.  Surprisingly enough, the near four-and-a-half hours of footage seem no longer than the original three-and-a-half.  Furthermore, the Extended Edition offers the same caliber of special features that were part of the first two Extended Editions for Lord of the Rings.  These documentaries are grand expositions of the work done by the phenomenal crew and cast as they worked to realize this dream.

I indeed suggest this movie for all who have experienced the first two installments of The Lord of the Rings.  For those who have not done such, I suggest seeing them all because they are truly the movie masterpieces of our time.  The Return of the King is the gem in the crown for the work done by all involved with the Lord of the Rings project.",1110585600,2,2382,4.657894736842105

7274268,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"As with the first two extended cut DVDs, Peter Jackson and company have outdone themselves in packing the discs with plenty of behind the scenes extras and new scenes, some of which generated much hand-wringing from the Middle Earth fanbase over whether or not they would be included or not. One scene was the Saruman death scene at Orthanc. This is found here and is played out quite nicely.
Another scene is the Houses Of Healing and the subsequent connection between Eowyn and Faramir. This too is found here and is acted marvelously.
One scene not found here that irked me -- and many fans -- was the lack of explanation concerning Denathor's madness. Alas, all we get is a very ambiguous reference when Aragorn reveals himself to Sauron as the King when he finds the Palantir wrapped in Denathor's robes. But the way it is shot you never know if its actually Denathor's pelantir or if its the one Pippin looked into at the beginning of the film. Denathor was a more sympathetic character in the book and comes across as a simple madman here.
The extra scenes are wonderful but really add nothing to the plot. Some though, I have to say, are pointless. I never thought I would say this but it is true -- most notably the scenes when Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are on the Paths of the Dead -- having the dead army reject their offer to fight and having all of the corny skulls go rumbling all around them... then to have the army change its mind... really, why??

Many of us have seen the LOTR movies, and I write now not to sway or enthuse on that front, but simply to say: watch the DVD appendices, especially the final appendix disk on Return of the King. It is sheer magic, and stands alone as a wonderful piece of documentary production. If you have a soft spot for LORT, you WILL love it. If you are interested in the art and craft of movies, you WILL play it at least 3 times. If you even work in any sort of project-based field, you WILL see yourself (or your dreams) on-screen.

It presents an amazing insight into what it was like working on such a unique endeavour. The commitment and passion shine through, but also you see what went into to building such a team. It didn't come from no-where, and I came away with a new appreciation for Peter Jackson's leadership, putting him in the Dunlap/Turner/Gates/Clinton league of you ask me and a generation above and beyond the likes of Lucas, Scorcese et al [the old guard].

There are some amazingly touching moments revealed, such as the hakka performed by the stunt crew in honour of the ""two kings"" and as a farewell to Viggo - truely he had become their ""king"".

Merry wishes to fight in war, but the men of Rohan don't want him as a burden to carry through war. Elrond gives Aragorn the blade that was once broke, but is now restored and tells him that the only way to win the war is with the help of ghost men that hide in the mountains. Only the king of Gondor can control them, in Return of the King Aragorn finally accepts his fate as the King of Men He along with Legolas, and Gimli go into the mountains and the cave that hold the dead army. This scene has the best special effects out of the whole movie.

Gollum tries and successfully comes between Sam and Frodo. Gollum leads Frodo and Sam up the secret stairs and tricks Frodo into believing Sam at the last of their food supplize, Frodo bids Sam to leave and he does. Gollum continues to lead Frodo up the stairs and they reach a dark tunnel filled with spiderwebs. Frodo realizes that Gollum has tricked him, but not soon enough. A giant spider attacks Frodo, he remembers that he has a special light that was given to him by Lady Galadriel. He uses it against the spider, and it seems to work.. The spider goes and hides and Frodo stays to regain strength, but he lengered to long in the spiders layer. The spider stabs Frodo and paralyizes him, then covers him in its web.

Sam ignores Frodo's request and comes back to Frodo's aid at his time of need.  He scares off orc's and attacks the spider until it leaves. Frodo fears that the orc's have taken the ring but come to realizes that Sam took it while he was paralyized. Sam gave Frodo the ring back and they continued to the fires Mordor. They dress up as orc's and get to the outer rim of the tower of Mordor. Something outside gets the orc's attention along as the great eye's attention, it's a distraction created by Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf, Gimli, Merry, Pippin, and a living army of men. They go to fight the orc's and give Sam and Frodo the chance to destroy the one ring.

Frodo is to week to continue, Sam realizes he can't carry the ring, but he picks up Frodo and starts to carry him. They are attacked by Gullom who is still trying to take the rin from Frodo. While Sam and Gollum continue to fight Frodo finds the currage to take the ring to fires of Mordor. The men recieve help from large eagles, who fight the nazgul in mid air while men attack the orc's on land. Sam meets Frodo in the mountain and bids Frodo to distroy the ring. The Ring seems to have to much control over Frodo and he keeps it. Frodo puts the ring on and starts to leave the mountain, but is attacked by Gollum. They fight, and Gollum bites the finger that has the Ring off Frodo but its not over, Frodo pushes Gollum with the ring into the fires of Mordor. Gollum and the Ring and everything evil are finally destroyed.

The tower of Mordor falls and fire spreeds and burns. Sam hurr's Frodo out of the mountain and onto a high rock excaping the lava or ""fire"".  Once the ring is distroyed Frodo starts to remember his life in the Shire. Sam remembers his crush on Rosie, and says he wanted to marry her.  Frodo and Sam fear it's the end for them, only to see  Gandalf come to their aid with a giant egal. The Egal picks Frodo and Sam up with their feet and fly them to safer grounds. Frodow then wakes back in Rivendell with the sun on his face and the sound of calming birds near by. He realizes he's still alive and see's Gandalf for the first time since he fell in the Misty Mountains. He then is happily reunited with Merry Pippin, Gimli, Legolas, Aragorn, and Sam.

Next you're taken back to the white city of Gondor. To the crowing of Lord Aragorn, the king of all men. He is crowned by Gandalf the white in front of the city of Gondor. Aragorn sings a song in elvish, and walks up to meet Legolas and group evles. He sees Arwen and Elrond. Arwen walks up to him and he gives her a kiss. Together Lord Aragorn and Lady Arwen walk up to the hobbits who bow to them. Aragorn tells the hobbits that they boy to no one and the city of Gondor all bows to the hobbits.

Frodo ends Bilbo's story of their and Back again that was started in the Fellowship of the Ring. The hobbits finally return to the shire. They try to pick up their normal lives again but find it difficult. Sam finally gets the courage to ask Rosie to marry him. They show the wedding of Rosie and Sam. Frodo can't settle back into his own life and realizes he must leave the Shire again. They take Bilbo head to the harbor to the last ship to leave middle earth. No one expects that Frodo is going to leave with them until he takes his place besides the elves. He asks Sam to completely finish the story. The end by showing Sam returning home to Rosie and his kids.

This maybe a long movie, yes but if you've seen the other two movies it's well worth the time! I give it an A along with the other two versions of the Lord of the Rings. I hope sometime soon I can see the extended version of Return of the King.",1109980800,2,5162,4.203030303030303
7274272,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"I'm just so sorry to say this to fans, but I have to as currently I just read through all 3 books. The biggest distingulishment between the 2 mediums is, in simple words, the books are fun, the movies are boring. I will say it in another simple way, the books, amoung many other books in the same genre, it still stay both original and fun to read. The movies, however, compare to its type in movie market, way way way boring, to name a few in the market, ""Willow"", ""Robin Hood-Prince of theives"", ""Harry Potter"". I put most of the blame to this man who won the academy award, Mr. Peter Jackson. Dun get me wrong, the art department whom took the jobs for this movie done their job to make it unpossibly being better at this time around. But the core man who handle the main flow and the cut of the movie, is a main flaw under my witness. Jackson has just so little talent to be a director to handle this project, he has also no prevision of what this movie ""should"" turn out to be, I have no wonder some people would call this series of movie ""documentary style"", as beyond to be called a documentary of an epic novel, it has absolutly no style, the man is apparently randomly accepting whatever materials that come to his hands, a director without inspiration muscle got lost in teh big forrest of different possibilities and he simply just roll dice for it as his solution, I watched the ""making of"" discs, that's exactly what he looks like his doing there.  May be people who support the books simply want no more but a clone version of book to be seen on big theaters, but I plead that thought, I love the books yet I plead becasue as I myself a definite lovers of movie magic who have seen so many great movies in the past, this movie just deliver so little, its dullness draw my patience in theater that I have to sustain so hard to sit through the whole movie, but then it was successful, supported by blinded fans whom driven by a genius writer who existed before my time, and Jackson took the credit without practicing very talent of his own. Every great movie makers in the past who's works are targeting to young audience brought their uniqueness to has a form of their movie style, to name a few - Speilberg, James Cameron, Scott Brothers. I'm more than in full confidence if this movie is handle by Speilberg, it would 10 times more fun yet stay original than the current dull version, James Cameron would make it entertaining but a little over the top of being cool for this movie, Scott Brothers would make the war goes beyond any of us can imagine but then the movie will become more or less a purely man's sport game, which will be a little weird. There are also many directors' name that well worth to mention to handle the job rather Jackson, here's a list of few - Danny Boyle, Cameron Crowe, Hiyao Miyazaki. The Art in these films are great, the core motion and story flow is bad, period.",1109808000,6,2910,4.349264705882353
7274273,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"Maybe the Real State Agencies of the Shire have very good prices and Sam does not have to worry about buying a round house,otherwise I cannot understand why Sam did not throw Frodo into the Mountain of Destiny....and get Rosie to live as kings at Frodo's.

7274274,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"In one of the special features, Tom Shippey shares his thoughts on Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, and the movies. Mr. Shippey wrote ""J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century"" and ""The Road To Middle Earth."" In the interviews for the special feature, Mr. Shippey said he thought that there were now two equal ways to access Tolkien's work: through the books, and through the movies.

I agree with Mr. Shippey. I read the books for the first time in 1977 at the age of 16; I read them several times more over the years. I read them out loud to my daughter as she grew up. The end of The Return of the King has always moved me deeply, especially the sense of loss as the hobbits return to Hobbiton, and for Frodo especially, it isn't the same as when he left. The scene at the Grey Havens has always moved me to tears. The movie did just the same, and in the same way as the book.

As in the first two movies, Peter Jackson has stayed close to the spirit and the letter of Tolkien's written work. I reread ""The Grey Havens"" last night, and some of the most important dialogue is taken directly from Tolkien himself. The special feature interviews relating to Tolkien himself are a such a nice addition - focusing on the man who made these movies possible.

Again, too, I am moved by Peter Jackson's own passion and devotion to the story. The degree of detail and care is evident in stray shots and trivial costume matters - which are clearly not trivial to all who were involved in creating these films.

Return of the King continues the excellence and passion of Jackson's work in the previous films, and stays true to Tolkien's work.",1108944000,9,1630,4.40531561461794
7274275,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Before I go into more details let me first say this:

if you are a Tolkien purist and you didn't like the theatrical edition of The return of the king and you hope this extended edition will ""fix"" it, you'll be quite disappointed. Alltough this movie re-inserts many scenes cut from the book, gives us more depht and insight to character motivation and has a more even pacing, it doesn't ""fix"" anything but rather expands on what was allready there.

However, if you, like me, loved the original edition, you'll certainly love this version even more (and yes, I've read the book).

Most of the new scenes aren't vital, but still add more depht and background into the story. The pacing is slowed down a bit, so the viewer has actually some time to breathe between all the intense epic battles.

I'll mention the things I found worth noting below (skip it if you don't like spoilers or long reads).

The voice of Saruman - yes it's back. In the original movie Isengard is dealt with in only a few minutes. Now there's a quite long confrontation with the now defeated Saruman. It's a great scene that both gives resolution to an important character, explains how the palantir got in the water and foreshadows what's to come in the next 4 hours. I'm glad Jackson didn't go for another wizard fight (save for one fireball) but focusses on the dialogue instead - indeed lots of Tolkiens original dialogue made the cut. Even the way Saruman dies is quite true to the book, alltough it happens at Isengard instead of the Shire now. Great addition.

The next part of the movie is a bit of silence before the storm and feels like a transition between The two towers and Return of the king, both tying up the loose ends of TTT and foreshadowing what's going to happen in the last chapter.

Gandalf arrival at Minas Tirith is where The Return of the king really starts (of course all 3 parts are basically 1 very long movie, but still). And from there, the movie is pure gold.

All the extra Minas Tirth footage sure is welcome. It gives us more background about the city and the characters Faramir and Denethor get some more attention. While Denethor still is torn by despair and grief from the start (we never see his noble side - no pun intended) we get more insight into his motives. Same goes for Faramir - there's a great scene between him and Pippin, which makes his suicide charge even more moving. The battle for Minas Tirith has only a few extra footage, but still remains one of the most spectactular battles ever seen on screen.

Something that really improved is the whole ""paths of the dead"" section. There's more build-up, and it's made very clear that the dead aren't very reliable allies that will do everything Aragorn wants them to do. He should be glad that they finally decided to help him out in the first place (so that's why the army of death can't be used at the black gates!). It ends perfectly with the king of the dead saying ""we fight!""(what should have been left out tough is the scene where the corsairs get whiped out, it's a useless scene and only spoils the surprise later on).

Another major improvement is the part between Pellenor and the final climax at the black gate/mount doom. Thanks to a few small scenes, the ""victory"" at Pellenor feels a lot more bittersweet now. Pippin looking for Merry at the battlefield between all the corpses and destruction is expanded and really moving now. The houses of healing is a much needed breather between all the intense fighting.

The journey trough Mordor of Frodo and Sam is also improved and expanded. There's a nice scene where they are mistaken for orcs and have to march with them towards the black gates (and finally escape after a while).

The Mouth of Sauron is also back in (quite creepy scene). This all provides more and better build-up to the final climax, which remains utterly breathtaking.

To sum it up: the extended edition of The Return of the king improves on an allready awesome film so I highly recommend it. If you didn't like the original version tough, this film likely won't change your mind.",1108944000,9,4087,4.582191780821918
7274276,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Two things. First, I'm just doing this one review to cover the entire trilogy, because it's all a single entity as far as I'm concerned. And I'm doing it for the extended versions because that's what I bought. I knew that's what I wanted and I just endured the extra wait until the extended version of each segment was released. Second, I'm endlessly amused by people who quibble that Jackson didn't remain faithful to the books, line for line. I mean, c'mon, they're translating from one medium to another. It's amazing that they did as well as they did. Did they take some liberties? Of course. Did some elements get left out? Of course, but what we got is remarkably true to the books. I applaud Peter Jackson and the rest of the people involved for bringing this tale to the screen. They did a magnificent job. I never expected to see these books done anywhere near this well.

The movies, themselves? They're beautiful. The faithfulness, the attention to detail, the gorgeous scenery, the drama, the touches of humor (very much ala Tolkien), the sound, the special effects, the acting...  This movie deserved all the academy awards it got. In fact, they could have given each film the award for best picture in it's year and it would have suited me just fine.

I recently sat down on a Saturday with my brothers and watched all three extended versions in sequence on a big screen TV (one brother has the whole set-up: big screen, surround sound, etc.). WOW! We started just after noon and ended around 2:30 the following morning. That includes brief breaks between discs and an hour for dinner between TTT and ROTK. It was a lot of movie and I'll not try something like that again soon, but it was a terrific experience. I had hobbits and other denizens of Middle Earth in my dreams for the next two or three nights, but I'm definitely not complaining.

Not everyone will love these, of course. You can't please all of the people all the time (to re-work an old bit of wisdom), but the almost universal acclaim says a lot. This is classic literature brilliantly realized on the screen. I'm happy to own these DVDs (and I haven't ever viewed most of the extensive special features yet). If you're one of those who hasn't seen them yet...well, what are you waiting for? Don't just take my word for it, there are an overwhelming number of other 5-star reviews here. Go for it. The LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy gets my very highest recommendation (both books and movies).",1108857600,,2469,4.617312072892939
7274277,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"All three Lord of the Rings movies were released with extra footage on the Extended Edition DVDs, but I think Return of the King benefited most.

The extended scenes for the most part, are nice to have because they further flesh out the characters (such as the house of healing-Eowyn meeting Faramir).  Some, I'm quite puzzled as to why they were not included in the theatrical release, since they are quite good, and would have helped make the movie better, such as Gandalf's meeting with the Witch King.  Others were a bit silly, such as the drinking contest scene; don't get me wrong, it's quite funny, especially Gimli's nutty remark, but kind of superflous.  Instead, I don't understand why Peter Jackson didn't use that scene to follow the books little game between Eomer and Gimli, regarding Gimli's claim that Eomer admit Lady Galadriel was the most beautiful female he's ever seen or he'll cut off his head; for those who've never read the books, it ends when Eomer finally sees Galadriel at the end of the book, but tells Gimli to cut his head off becasue he cannot say it. Gimli asks why, and Eomer answers that he thinks Arwen is the most beautiful.  Gimli concedes, saying that Eomer has chosen the night, while he prefers the day- an allegory to the ladies' respective hair color.

The extras were pretty interesting too.  Many documentaries about the filming, cast accounts, and other tidbits about what went on behind the scenes.  It was especiall nice to see what happened with the horses, and it did give me a warm fuzzy when I heard about Vigo's kind gesture to one of the horse rider doubles.

It was amazing to think that Peter Jackson was still working on the film only a few weeks before it was released worldwide.  One of the documentaries really shows the pressure many of the people working on this film felt; they were even a bit harsh with each other at some points :0

It was also a nice surprise to find out that the actor playing Pippin (hopefully I'm not getting my hobbits mixed up) wrote and actually sang the song in the Steward of Gondor's hall.

If you are like me, and has collected all the extended edition versions of this trilogy (those nifty fake book covers make them so nice), you'll find that inside, there is a coupon with an offer for a case cover for all 3 extended edition films.

7274281,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I have been a LOTR fan for over twenty years, and I absolutely love these movies, and of the three my favourite is ROTK.

I was always looking forward to this one the most because it has my favourite scenes in it... 'The Choices of Master Samwise', 'The Grey Havens', the Mount Doom scenes, (I guess I should just say all the Frodo and Sam scenes) all of which were done superbly, although I have to admit that I was hoping for more of the 'The Choices of Master Samwise' in the EE, I know there is a little more but still, this in no way takes away from how truly superb this movie is.

I just love every single little bit of it, especially the Frodo and Sam parts, which were done exceedingly well. Can I just say that I think Sean Astin and Elijah Wood are amazing, their performances are truly outstanding. Elijah is Frodo, I just can't see Elijah in there at all, he does it so well, that I just can't distinguish between his Frodo and the one in the Book, which for me is phenomenal as Frodo has been my favourite character (bar none) for all of those twenty years.

Anyway, all  I can say is having waited for this movie for so long I was in no way disappointed, this movie (FOTR, TTT and ROTK) will always be my favourite movie, I love it so much, I can't even begin to tell you how much.",1108598400,,1296,4.151394422310757

7274283,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This extended edition of 'Return of the King' has an extra 48 minutes added and they have been so skilfully inserted you would think they had always been there.

A welcome extra is the scene where Sauraman is confronted by the fellowship and, although defiant to the last, is finally defeated once and for all, it ties up what was a loose end in the theatrical version. The drinking competition between Gimli and Legolas is really amusing and both actors make their roles so believable throughout. The little 'asides' they make to each other give some comic relief to what could so easily have become a dark and bleak film.

Sure, the films are not identical to the books, but Peter Jackson has produced a masterpiece of a trilogy and has introduced a lot of people to the books who may not otherwise have read them. Purists may not be happy but the majority of LOTR fans will love this extended version. The collector's edition also has a polystone 'Minas Tirith' keepsake box and an additional DVD of Howard Shore's LOTR symphony. This collector's edition is well worth spending your pennies on and highly recommended a brilliant finale to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.",1108166400,8,1172,4.712195121951219
7274284,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"In itself; the trilogy represents a massive amount of work by anyone who wishes to undertake it.  By this I mean that if you are reading it, studying it, using it as a basis for another story, or adapting it onto film, the work ahead of you is immense.  There is so much to sift through, so much to discard and not discard, and at times the material is so dense you can almost feel the words pushing against you.

That Peter Jackson finished this film epic in less than ten years is quite remarkable.  He's taken the elemental plot-lines, scattered them and then reordered them.  He's gone through the essential ""cinematic"" elements in the books and filmed them with great care.  Some would say he's done a tremendous service not only to Lord of the Rings, but to Tolkien, and reviving an area of literature long since overlooked.

""Return of the King"" marks the last chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  In this film we see Frodo finally make it to Mount Doom; and although he does not truly complete his quest, his actions are natural and truthful.  Having him simply walk up to the edge, look balefully over the lava and toss the ring in would have simply been too, well, lame.  Tolkien felt this, so he wrote a different kind of resolution, one that tied up more than one loose end.  The film keeps to this faithfully.  This film is also where Aragorn and his retinue make haste to Minas Tirith to repel the forces of Sauron.  His actions here have great meaning as to the kind of king he will become later on.

I do take issue with a few things.  The most important is that the Scouring of the Shire was left unfilmed.  This is a brilliant and uplifting chapter in the novel; one that shows just how far the hobbits have come since they left the Shire, and justifies their changed selves in the face of a changeless culture they are a part of.  It shows how they re-emerged and blossomed into the strong Shirelings they are compared to the others around them.  Instead the film opts to show that old hobbit scowling at them as they ride back decked out in Gondor regalia.  This hardly does the book justice; also another shaky aspect is the way Saruman's death is handled.  In the film, it comes much too early, and in such a fashion that cries out ""Hollywood!"" that for a moment the screen reeks.

Also uncomfortable in this movie is Viggo Mortensen as he becomes king.  The man never looked kingly to me, I'm sorry.  I thought they would do something special with his appearance, perhaps give him the short hair and goatee of Theoden?  Or perhaps make him seem more of a proud, wisened figure?  Instead, he looks totally out of his element in the crown and the neatly-trimmed beard; and perhaps it's the way he's standing?  Perhaps he is meant to seem awkward in that position; but the book present Aragorn as seeming kingly and noble even before his crowning, and the film version doesn't transmit that.

Be warned too; this edition is long.  Three bottles of wine long.  By the time you're done watching your eyeballs will hurt and you'll be completely smashed.

But all the hype you've heard is true, and the film is brilliant from head to toe.  So there should be no hesitation with this one (I still prefer the first film though!)",1108080000,9,3248,4.4727891156462585

7274286,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I attended the theatrical release of *Return of the King* on December 17th, 2003, queuing in line for two hours and waiting another hour once seated in the auditorium. The energy of the room seethed with barely retrained anticipation, a tangible excitement, along with perhaps a trace of nervousness - Jackson was 2 for 3, but *King* was the watershed: the one film where all of LotR's themes, character arcs, plot development and essential tension would find climatic resolution...or else fail, either spectacularly or disastrously, rendering all that before a wasted effort.  I personally had no doubts as to Jackson and co.'s abilities, and the film more than exceeded my expectations, capping the cinematic momentum of its two predecessors and paying satisfactory adaptation to the book(s) upon which it was based.  And yet, a feeling of incompletion haunted my euphoria, a sentiment very much similar to my reaction to the theatrical version of *The Two Towers*.  The special effects blew me away, the acting more than once tugged a tear from my eyes, yet in the end I knew what I had witnessed was a truncated version of *Return of the King*, with a rumored hour of footage left on the editing floor.  The cuts were dramatic - Saruman, the Witch-King/Gandalf confrontation - and, in some places, disconcertingly obvious, the rough transitions and haphazard pacing occasionally jerking me from the spell of the film.  I consoled myself that an Extended Edition would eventually `complete' the movie I had just witnessed, filling in the blank spaces and producing a much ~smoother~ viewing experience.  Such had been the case with *The Two Towers*, another film that suffered in its condensed version and subsequently became a masterpiece upon the Extended release.

It is my firm belief that Peter Jackson as his illustrious associates (all several thousand of them) filmed these movies to *be* a 12 hour cinematic cycle, and the demands of the in-theater attention span (and New Line's profit margin) forced into necessity the widespread and sometimes arbitrary editing process.  The films themselves, when compared side by side, are testament enough; and the voluminous evidence as to the trials and tribulations of paring this four hour epic down to size, by way of the documentaries featured on this edition, set this impression in stone.  Like many others, I have no desire whatsoever to re-visit the theatrical releases, the Extended being the true completed rendition of *LotR*.

The additional material of *Return of the King* tends to focus on small, intimate character moments, increasing the weight and depth of the story as a whole; and in the subtle lengthening of individual scenes, turning chopped cliff-notes *LotR* into a fully realized creative scope.  And what scope this is! It's easy to see why *Return of the King* amassed the box office returns and awards that it did - the film elevates all that brought forth previously, and enhances it tenfold.  The battles are bigger and incredibly intense, with much more at stake; the emotional denouement of Frodo and Sam's journey, from the pastoral Shire to the hellish pits of Mt. Doom, is devastating.  It helps that every aspect of the filmmaking process was taken up a notch post-production. Return of the King has the best special effects of the three movies (the best I've ~ever~ seen, to be honest), the grandest and most resonant score courtesy of Howard Shore, and an overall confidence/mastery of cinematography and scale that, on a purely aesthetic level, make *Return of the King* an artistic wet-dream, breathtakingly beautiful to an astonishing degree.  And now with the original editing restored and the drama allowed its maximum impact, this film has become cinematic near-perfection, the crown jewel of Jackson's masterpiece.

That said, *Return of the King* does have its share of minor flaws that even the Extended cut was unable to overcome.  The opening flashback fishing scene with Smeagol and Deagol struck me as overtly goofy, especially in lue of its homicidal conclusion.  The Armies of the Dead, when viewed afar, look rather fake, the only real CGI mishap.  Denathor's character remains sadly underdeveloped, his madness via palantir-corruption strangely excised.  And the much-hyped Witch-King/Gandalf fight comes in far too abruptly and, though I'm no purist, violates the original text.  But these are minor when compared to the Lighting of the Beacons...Minas Tirith, in all its [miniature] glory...the Houses of Healing...the Ride of the Rohirrim...the entire Oliphaunt confrontation...the cataclysmic choice at Mt. Doom. At last, at long last, a fantasy world has come to life on the silver screen: a mythos has been made real.

The effort involved to make it feel as real as possible is chronicled and concluded on the two Appendices discs; and, more than before, the toll it took to produce these movies, and the exactitude of craft Weta achieved, is presented with painstaking detail.  Although early reports about *RotK* were positive - Jackson constantly stating that it was the easiest and most fun to make - the Appendices reveal that this was an affirmation-faade: *RotK* more than doubled the number of effects shots of the first two movies combined, and proved a nightmare for Jackson and Jamie Selkirk to (not quite) successfully edit into a cohesive whole.  Particularly revealing is a section where one of the peak effects shots, that of the Oliphants colliding, was rejected due to cinematography issues: the staff went back and composed the shots in a 48 hour stretch, on the very threshold of the deadline.  Amazing stuff! It's rewarding to see these artisans go up and beyond anything they thought they were capable of, and in turn fashion some of the best work in cinematic history.

Filming *The Lord of the Rings* was once considered impossible by conventional standards; but with the right amount of passion, dedication and love for the source material, a little team from New Zealand surmounted all odds and produced a stunning success.

I LOVE THE FIRST MOVIE. the EE is near flawless film making. So how can you go from that to this silly, overly self-important, deliberately manipulative story telling. WHA' HAPPENED? I'll tell you what. the director got caught up in his own hype. Christopher Lee had every right to be annoyed and at least this version fixes that. the story is more fleshed out, as it is with all three EE's, but it still doesn't fix the fundamental floors of a film with far too many endings, a magic user who does barely anything magical, and characters that have been given the hollywood treatment (the rot started with the 2nd flick).  once the new smell wears off this one many will see it for what it really is: overly long and boring.",1107561600,5,972,4.311475409836065
7274289,1,B00Z9YZRVE,"Tolkien was not keen on seeing his works on film. Indeed most of his friends were vehemently against it, especially C.S. Lewis. Out of respect for the author, any true admirer of Tolkien should not support any movie made from any of his works.

Tolkien himself said:

""In human art Fantasy is a thing best left to words, to true literature...visible presentation...silliness or morbidity are frequent results"" (""Essays"" 68)

In this case silliness is definitely the result. This film has terrible special effects that look as fake as they are, the acting leaves a great deal to be desired and the characters are miscast and cartoonized.

In the extended edition many hoped it would be 'fixed' but even duct tape couldn't fix this disaster, if you buy this it would be a better investment to flush your money down the nearest drain. Go buy the book.",1107561600,12,848,4.787671232876712

One alternate ending found on the appendicies (which disk it was on fails my memory) is worth a look, even though it's shown in storyboard format. An added extra are the two ""easter eggs""; one hidden on each disk. Though I won't say what they are here, they are really funny.

7274292,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"No one ever before the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy durst to do as Peter Jackson with his trilogy: to create a whole new edition of the film to be released exclusively on DVD.

Something similar has been done before with `Criterion' or `Director's cut'  editions, but this as a new project is something to admire. Jackson's love for both the original books and filmmaking can be seen here.

First of all, 50 minutes added of film sound definitely attractive if you have seen the previous films extended, most of the extra  scenes are extracted directly from the books, highlights to see in this new edition:

- The voice of Saruman. This sequence will show you the final fate of our beloved white wizard.

- Cross-roads of the Fallen King. A beautiful sequence directly from the original book.

- The Wizard's pupil. There's more on Denethor than meets the eye.

- Peregrin of the tower guard. Another one from the book.

- The Corsairs of Umbar. Check out Peter Jackson's cameo here... with the whole production team!

- The Witch King's hour. Originally seen in the trailer for the movie, the confrontation between Gandalf and the Witch King is here!

- The Houses of the Healing. Featuring a song by Liv Tyler, beautiful.

- Aragorn masters the Palantir. He shows to Sauron himself!

- In the company of Orcs. Frodo and Sam march in Orc lines just as they do in book 3!

- The Mouth of Sauron. The evil character who greets the Fellowship at the Black gates.

And of course there are new scenes that represent minor changes but that add more depth to every single character in the film.

The extra material as usual is the most comprehensive documentary I have ever seen in DVD history (think about it, 6 discs full of additional material), including some abandoned and actually filmed concepts featuring Aragorn fighting Sauron himself!

One recommendation though, if you haven't bought this 4 disc set, go for the special edition set that includes a miniature of Minas Tirith beautifully crafted by Weta Designers and a bonus DVD featuring excerpts from Howard Shore's live presentations of the film's music. The two extras are worth the $20 difference.",1107561600,4,2161,4.750670241286863

All the same it was an excellent film that on its own, and with its two earlier films will take a long time to top.

All of the special features are not rehashing the special features of the other two extended version DVDs, but show new details of the filming and post production.  One of my favorites was the Oscar night scenes and the elation of the cast and crew.  Another favorite was the good-bye scenes for all the major cast members as they filmed their last pick-up scenes, especially Elijah Wood's.

The new scenes are great, adding yet more of Tolkien's words and story to the already brilliant film.  I loved the additional scene of Faramir and Eowyn connecting--two characters who had been through great personal loss and emotional pain, finding a soulmate in the other--which was a favorite part of the book for me.  I also liked the Saruman scenes eventhough that was not like the book.

I found this movie to be unbearably boring. I actually had to fast-forward through parts of it, it was so slow. I sometimes wonder if people fall into the trap of thinking this is a brilliant movie because of the PR behind it. Oscar? I must be really missing something here.

It was a few big boring fight scenes strung together with slow dialogue, weak plot lines and great visuals. I can only watch a sword battle so many times - they really aren't all that many variations.

7274298,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I confess...of the three Lord of the Rings films, The Two Towers is my hands-down favorite. But Return of the King is a worthy second place in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. This is the extended edition. While it's fun to see the extra stuff, the theatrical release of this film is better paced and more watchable. I find that some places of this EE get bogged down with too much detail, particularly when it comes to the endless scenes with Gollum, easily my least favorite character in the triology. And we really didn't need more of Denathor...the stuff we already had was too ""over the top"" for my tastes.

While I appreciated the extra scenes in the Paths of the Dead, I liked the theatrical release better from the standpoint that we don't learn that the dead have joined the battle until the critical moment. Revealing it too soon as is done in the EE ruins that later moment when the armies of the dead coming crashing down on Pelannor Fields.

Easily the most enjoyable moment in ROTK-EE is the Gimle and Legolas drinking scene with a bemused Eomer looking on. Fun stuff!

Disappointments? Well I guess I read too many spoilers because I was truly sad that the wedding of Faramir and Eowyn was not included after I had read that it had been filmed. I also wanted some new stuff at the end of the film...why not show Legolas and Gimle starting out on their adventures? It wouldn't have taken a lot of screen time and we know from the ""making of"" features that it was filmed.

Overall this is a product that every true LOTR fan must own. But I think over the long haul, it's the theaterical release that will bear the repeated viewing in my house.",1106870400,2,1654,4.448844884488449
7274299,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I should start here by saying that I have read the Lord of the Rings many times and am deeply immersed in its lore.  Peter Jackson's movies are far from perfect adaptations of the books, but they gain a lot of points for the respect and passion for the source material that is present in every frame.  Peter, Phillipa, Fran and their disciples took this franchise very seriously and it shows.  That being said I will proceed with your regularly scheduled review. I feel that there are really 3 different reviews to be made here; first of the movie itself, second of the extended footage in the Platinum edition and last of the many documentaries present in the appendices.

The Return of the King is both the most spectacular and most flawed film of the trilogy.  The documentaries reveal that the final days of the production and scoring were more than a little rushed as the movie hurtled towards completion.  Perhaps for this reason the balance sometimes seems off, and huge action set pieces often dominate important turning points.  <SPOILER> This was particularly evident in the Battle of Pellenor Fields, where Eowyn and Merry's confrontation with the Lord of the Nazgul was largely upstaged by Army of the Dead (who only battled the corsairs in the books) and by Legolas' acrobatics with Mamukin (barely mentioned in an aside in the books).  This annoyed me, but overall did not diminish my love for the movie and what it did accomplish<End SPOILER>.  There was also a conscious decision by the filmmaker to exaggerate some the character traits of some characters to make explicit what Tolkien left implicit.  Denethor was the major victim of this, his madness and despair overwhelming the strength and intelligence.  Frodo and Aragorn are also somewhat less strong and decisive than they could have been, but this does serve to place them on a more human and approachable scale.  But overall the film is far greater than the some of its flaws; it is sumptuously beautiful, vastly exciting and finally emotionally evocative.  Particular note should also be made of Bernard Hill's spectacular performance as Theoden.

The extended features are a bit of mixed bag.  The scenes at the beginning with Saruman are absolutely essential and powerful (and frankly I don't understand why they were left out of the theatrical release).  The extra time spent with Frodo and Sam in Mordor was also pretty well spent.  Other sequences, like a drinking match between Legolas and Gimli, and some silly Gimli moments on the Path's of the Dead seem strangely out of place and disturb the flow of the movie.  There are also some extra scenes for the battle of Pellenor Fields, some of which was good, but the overall effect once again moved the emphasis of the battle away from Rohan to Aragorn, Gimli and particularly Legolas.  In the final analysis the extended version is pretty much a wash and not notably better or worse than the theatrical cut.

The documentaries present in the appendices are generally fabulous, if you have the time and patience to make your way through them.  I was also surprisingly moved by the short films by a young New Zealand film-maker than were included as part of Fran Walsh's inspiration for writing the song Into the West.  More than anything the documentaries reveal what an epic, labor of love this whole project was and how engaged everyone involved became by the end.  They made me love and appreciate the film all the more, rather than taking away its magic.",1106784000,4,3490,4.838383838383838
7274300,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Most DVD extra feature are boring.  The LOTR trilogy is a HUGE exception to this.  Two entire discs are devoted to special features going into great detail on how the movies were created.  Another thing I love about this trilogy that differs from other DVD special features is the fact that the 'deleted scenes' are put into the movie where they should be, not as separate tracks in the special features section.

7274302,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"More preaching to the choir, but Peter Jackson has done what none of us ever thought possible with the entire trilogy. When I read it in the '70's, I naively looked forward to a movie version, not realizing what an undertaking that would be. CGI technology really made the movie possible and DVD's allowed Jackson to cater to all of us geeks by offering expanded versions that most mainstream movie-goers would not be able to sit through.

We all knew story lines would be trimmed, so it is amazing how faithful Jackson remained to Tolkien's books, given that limitation. And however you imagined Minas Tirith (or Two Tower's Helm's Deep), the filmed battle scenes rank among the best action sequences ever conceived.

If I had a disappointment, it was the Crack of Doom scene. Since first reading the book, I always thought the sight of Gollum dancing at the edge of the cliff with Frodo's finger STILL in the ring as an incredible image. I felt a little cheated when Gollum took the finger out of the ring; Tolkien's written version had an element of horror that added volumes to the evil power associated with the ring.

But I always thought THAT was really the book's climax. All of the closure after that, even the Scouring of the Shire, were the very definition of anti-climatic. Jackson certainly cut wisely by condensing that part of the book.

But I also know he is more attuned to this material than any of us could ever hope. Whatever pre-conceived notions we brought to this movie, Peter Jackson and his crew were true believers and they made this classic accessible to millions who would never think of reading such voluminous books.

Jackson's cinematic achievement is to movies what Tolkien's work was to literature. If that seems hyperbole, remember that Tolkien accomplished his books by himself, while Jackson had help from thousands of cast and crew members. But strictly from an artistic level, all 3 Lord of the Rings films will likely be in the low numbers of any future AFI Top 100 list.

Add on the extras in the DVD's, well, if you're reading this review you probably already have this set.",1106697600,5,2115,4.733695652173913
7274303,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"I was not impressed by Jacksons treatment of the series, i expected far more value for what Tolkiens script had to offer. My main gripe lay with the acting, i thought the acting of nearly all the characters lacked Gravitas. Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, Eowyn, Theoden were all boring in the film yet interesting in the book. The only exceptions were Ian Mckellan as Gandalf, The guy who did Gollum, Christopher Lee as Saruman (perfectly cast - acting with his eyes), Hugo Weaving as Elrond and the guy who played The Steward of Gondor. Then there is the issue of Jacksons judgement. The friendly rivalry between Legolas and Gimli for example was just a side issue yet in film 2 it was blown up into a big issue, perhaps Jackson was trying to be too completist, and a little more selectivity would have been in order, it made those characters look thin and childish. Another huge gripe is the Hollywoodisation of the film, i know the huge battle scene is important but in this film it is given the central role even over Frodo's Quest (which is central in the book). The battle scene was boring, you can only see orc creatures with bad make-up being slaughtered like children by long haired men with swords a limited number of times before it becomes tedious. Hollywood figured...'lets give them huge cgi madness, it will look good in the trailer'. The central plot of the third film should have been Frodo's slow succumbing to the power of the ring, this would have required a much better actor than the guy who played Frodo here, it would have required a deep ability to portray madness and personality change.

Tolkien's book extremely well written and atmospheric but it is far from perfect, it almost seemed as though he wrote it with Hollywood in mind given it's slightly saccharine ending. I felt little emotion watching this film yet great emotion reading the book, something has been lost in the translation....",1106611200,4,1915,4.733532934131737

7274305,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"There's absolutely no need to shower more praise on this extended masterpiece; it's fully as rich a filmgoing experience as is possible, given the limitations of Tolkein's material (some of which, I say much to the horror of the purists, Jackson improves upon).

  I easily give it the best rating ever for a fantasy adventure, BUT I and everyone else who saw the theatrical release waited far too long to see the complete story.  Christopher Lee's final scene as Saruman, which stunningly wraps up both the wizard's and Wormtongue's plotlines, is thrilling, shocking, excitingly filmed and utterly crucial to the plot and film.  In addition to wrapping up these narrative threads, the sequence even throws in a bit of ""Scouring of the Shire"", and actually does Tolkien one better, I think (I never liked Saruman's reduction to 'Sharkey', an ordinary thug, or his prosaic death in the original book).

  Everything else, even the attachment between Eowym and Faramir, the breaking of Gandalf's staff and the Mouth of Sauron, could legitimately be considered non-crucial, although I'm glad to finally have them, especially the latter; I relish how Aragorn ""concludes negotiations"".

  Besides feeling cheated, Lee must feel a sense of deja vu: in the last days of Hammer, he filmed ""To the Devil a Daughter"" (a much less successful adaptation of Dennis Wheatley than the far superior ""Devil Rides Out"")--and his entire death scene as the Satanist was cut!  Was Jackson feeling nostalgic for movies such as this, that don't even give their bad guys a proper comeuppance?

  Whatever.  Mr. Lee, you're the best ever, whether in black cape, white robe or British tweeds, and I'm delighted there is a yet another revival of your film work.  Had it not been for Peter Jackson's lapse in judgment in the final theatrical cut, we'd have had it sooner.  Jackson deserves every buck his trilogy made, and every award it ever won, but if he ever puts Mr. Lee in a film again, I hope he'll give the devil his due.",1106524800,4,2001,4.887240356083086
7274306,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I haven't read all of the previous reviews, so I don't know if anyone has commented on this.  Jackson's error in making it appear as if the eagles could take out the Nazgul raises a critical problem: If I'm not mistaken, in the book's description of the battle before the Black Gates, even though the eagles came to attack the armies of Sauron, they didn't attack the Nazgul's winged ""steeds.""  Tolkien was careful to cover all of his bases concerning Sauron's defenses, and with good reason:  If it was possible to disable the Nazgul en masse, there would be nothing preventing Frodo from merely riding to Mt. Doom on the back of an eagle, depositing the ring into the Cracks of Doom, and being home by teatime.  The whole story would have been over in the space of one chapter, and there'd be nothing particularly dramatic about LOTR.",1106524800,2,836,4.628378378378378

7274308,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The question of whether to buy or rent a film is based on whether or not you will want to see it more than three or four times asides from the opportunities you will have to see it on regular TV in the years to come.

This is why getting the Platinum Series makes a lot more sense than the regular version, because of all of the additional features, footage, etc. You know you are purchasing something that network tv won't be able to replicate.

But the real reason that you want to own this is that it is an artistic achievement, regardless of the story, the sheer visual splendor is entrancing.

That being said, there are some cavils with the production:

-- hair care was idiosyncratic and left a lot to be desired

-- Aragorn was played a little more soft than he really is

-- The editing of the Pippin story in Minas Tirith was a little bit of a disappointment

-- The lack of the ""cleansing of the Shire"" has a lot of the purists upset

All of the artistic choices that Jackson made were very understandable, and if you go back and re-read the originals, you can see that in some ways, he streamlined the plot very effectively.  People talk about the multiple endings as affecting their enjoyment, but Jackson actually cut down the number of loose ends that had to be managed.  There could have been 2 or 3 more endings if he'd chosen to have them.

7274310,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"I'll give this one three stars-- mainly because of the inexplicable divergences from the book.

WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD

1) The encounter with the mouth of Sauron.  Aragon doesn't kill the Mouth of Sauron in the books.  I can think of no reason why he should do so in the movie.  It was a pointless hollywood-isation of the original material.

2) The Drinking game.  Couldn't they have come up with a better way to illustrate the friendship between Gimli and Legolas than to stage a drinking game in which Legolas utters the anachronism ""Game over?""

3) Denethor:  In the books, he was strong willed, perhaps even a little pig-headed.  He was mad with grief and despair.  In the movie, he's more blood-thirsty, and the reason for his despair (he has a palantir stone in the books, which he used to view only what Sauron wanted him to see) is ignored completely.

4) Faramir:  In the books, he is stronger of will and nobler than Boromir.  He turns Frodo loose without bringing them to town.  In the movie, he drags Frodo and Sam out of their way to Gondor, only realizing his error once the Nazgul arrive and he is scared into letting Frodo go.  The character is substantially weakened, in my opinion.

5) The dismissal of Sam.  Sam and Frodo entered Shelob's lair together.  There was no intrigue by Gollum to get Frodo to send Sam away in the book.  And everything we learn of Sam's character in the movie says that he would never have simply left Frodo, even if Frodo demanded it.

Aside from these changes, the movie holds up well.  It's not the rollercoaster that it was in theaters, for which I am grateful.  The Extended edition makes vast improvements over the Theatrical release, but it remains the weakest movie of the series.

This is not to say that the movie is on down there with Godfather III and Return of the Jedi in terms of disappointment.  Make no mistake:  This is still a great movie.  It is but nit-picking to assert otherwise.

7274312,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"Make no mistake, I think with the first two films Peter Jackson pretty much buried the term 'unfilmable book'. They were two brilliant films and surpassed my expectations. It was with a real sense of excitement that I sat down in a cinema to watch this the third and final instalment, and in a nutshell it was a let down.

The issue that makes Return Of The King go wrong is its editing. To cut out the crucial character of Saruman and the role that he plays througout this part of the book and right at the end is probably the most glaring.

I would have like to have seen on screen the battle for The Black Ships Of Umbar but it is not there.

Another cut is the confrontation between Gandalf and The Witch King at the Great Gate of Gondor. In the book, this was one of the crucial elements of the battle of The Pelennor Fields and its exclusion badly detracts from the menace of the Witch King.

Also missing is the showdown at the Gates of Baradur between Gandalf and the Lieutenant Of The Tower which is a crucial lead in to the battle that follows almost immediately afterwards.

The ending itself is changed from that of the book so that instead of the enormous black, lightening crowned figure of Sauron filling the sky, we have the Eye in the Tower only collapsing in on itself which is frankly an anti climax.

On a more positive note, the Battle Of The Pelennor Fields is superb with the various armies, The Nazgul dive bombing the city, and The Mumakil crushing all before them.

Equally The Army Of The Dead is superbly realised, as is the walk into their mountain city beforehand.

Also the restoration of some of the cut scenes is also apparently in the extended version which I have still not seen yet, such was my disappointment with the theatrical release cut....

To sum up though this could of and should have been a much better film, it does not compare with the book or the first two films that have gone before.

Sorry Peter but it really does not hack it. When it comes time to film The Hobbit, please, please leave the scissors at home!",1105920000,2,2061,4.3858267716535435
7274313,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"In considering movies like this, one really has to look at them from two different persepectives: as a movie in and of itself, and seperately as an adaptation of the original book. Simply as a movie, Return of the King, even in its rather rushed theatrical version, is a spectacular film, easily five stars, and the extended edition neatly plugs several holes in the storyline, such as the fate of Saruman.

As an adaptation of the book, however, it's a mixed bag at best, although I'd say you have to give it four stars just for not being a muddled disaster, which it easily could have been. Being a long-time fan of Tolkien, not only as an entertaining story-teller, but also as a formidable master of the English language, I came into all three films from the point of view of comparing them to the original books. The various changes in the first two movies are jolting at times, but are understandable as being necessary to condense the story and make certain aspects of it easier to understand for a more casual audience. However, the changes in the Return of the King really baffle me, since they seem thrown in for no apparent reason and do little to improve the story. (Like the weird lighting shifts at the Battle of the Pelenor Fields or the changed dialogue in Eowyn's confrontation with the Witch-King.) Some of it seems less thought out alteration than just general sloppiness on the part of the director and the crew. Having characters talk about how dark it is when it's clearly as bright as mid-day on the screen makes it harder to take them seriously, in my opinion. I also find the portrayal of Gimli to be incredibly irritating. John-Rhys Davies does an excellent job with the role, bringing the character wonderfully to life, but the script he's given turns the serious character of Gimli into a bufoon. Dwarves as comic relief is an unfortunate aspect of contemporary fantasy literature which Jackson has grafted onto Tolkien's work, dumbing down what was originally a serious story-arc about the relationship between Dwarves and Elves and the overcoming of mistrust between very different peoples. Inexplicable little things like this make this my least favorite of the three films by a rather wide margin.

Those complaints aside, the movie does do a number of things remarkably well. The portrayal of Minas Tirith is amazing, and looks just right. Likewise, the troubled relationship of Faramir and Denethor is done masterfully, now that it's been fleshed out in the Extended Edition. I would have liked to see more explanation of Denethor's madness (as per the book), but the overall story doesn't suffer much from its lack. Gollum looks great (It's really hard to believe he's done in CG), and his whole story line is well-done on screen. I know some were upset by the absense of the Scouring of the Shire bit, but that whole sequence would have added another 30-60 minutes onto an already lengthy film. Most people simply wouldn't sit through all that. (Honestly, I don't even think I would, and I've read the trilogy about eight times.) Otherwise, the Extended Edition greatly enhances the story (I think these additions were the most meaningful of the three films.) Saruman's final scene, Gandalf's confrontation with the Witch-King, the Houses of Healing, and the Mouth of Sauron all get thrown in. Saruman's scene is my personal favorite, even though it is shortened and altered from the book version. I must admit to being somewhat disapointed with Gandalf's scene, which is one of my favorites in the entire trilogy, but at least it made it in. I couldn't believe it was left out of the theatrical version, since it is a rather important moment in the story, not to mention a very dramatic one.

In any case, while Return of the King is still my least favorite of the three, this version is far better than the theatrical in just about every way.",1105833600,6,3880,4.7880597014925375

My recomdendation is get all three of the extended versions over the movie versions because there is more footage and is also more complete as well over the movie versions because the movie versions are not so complete as all and you miss out out on allot of things compared to the extended versions and the extended versions are really the way to go.

***SPOILERS***
the corsairs and the mountain of skulls
***SPOILERS END***

and many of Denethor's added bits are hard to watch due to the actor's overuse of the 'quivering face technique'. But overall, the new scenes substantially improve on the theatrical release by adding some scenes inspired by the book in addition to many character moments.

The extras are laid out almost identically to both previous extended sets. They continue to be very in-depth and are more personal this time since this is the last behind-the-scenes hurrah for the cast/crew to say goodbye. The documentary on the post-production process shows how much labor of love and endurance went into this  often painful enterprise. The same goes for the people who made this DVD by repeating the process of adding new special effects, sounds, music, color grading and editing skill for the ~50 minutes of bonus footage. Not to mention getting the actors to once again loop dialogue for all of it, a necessary improvement over the bonus scenes in FOTR-extended where they used the scratchy dialogue recorded on set.

Looking back on the finished movies, Fellowship of the Ring in either version is, to me, still the best of the three with less dependence on spectacle and a melancholy, austere storybook feel that's missing in the others. In any case, my thanks go out to Peter Jackson & company. These are the only movies that I felt I got more than my money's worth, both in the theater and at home.",1105833600,4,1613,4.872262773722627

The Return Of The King Special Extended Edition

The third installment of the best movie ever made, Peter Jackson's epic motion picture The Lord Of The Rings; the brilliant theatrical cut is now enhanced with the supernatural 50-minute long extended cut.

To begin with, no words can describe the magnificence, fantasy, greatness of this movie.

The movie begins with a bit more intense scene between Dagol and Smagol; then we move to the more anticipated spectacular scene, the confrontation with Saruman and here we see how Saruman and Grima met their end.

More scenes were added to Edoras like woyn's dream. Minas Tirith's scenes is extended including brand new sequences, also, the tombs of the stewards scenes are extended.

Aragorn takes the paths of the dead and a huge avalanche of skulls falls towards him.

""You will not enter Gondor"", Aragorn says to the Corsairs' chieftain.

Extended scenes of the paths of the dead are just cool.

At last we see Gandalf confronts The Witch King. alas, the Witch King strikes Gandalf down but fortunately, he didn't die.

More Extended Scenes at the siege of Minas Tirith ad the battle of the Pelennor Fields were added.

""My Master Sauron the Great bids thee welcome"", The Mouth of Sauron at the Black Gates is a must see scene.

The Appendices are very good like the previous four parts, it continues the story of film making and share with the audience whish is really cool.

Special Features (Audio Commentaries) are good though I didn't hear them completely, they worth hearing especially the Director-Writers one.

7274321,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The first thing that comes to mind is WOW!!!!  I was enthralled for the whole four+ hours.

I will concentrate this review on the differences between this edition and the theatre version.  The new and extended scenes are definately aimed for those of us who wanted a movie version that is truer to the books.  The only complaint I have is the way in which the fate of Sauruman was portrayed.  It is not the same as in the books and I don't see why it couldn't have been done that way.  On to the good... I love the extra scene with Aragorn barterring with the Mouth of Sauron at the gates of Mordor.  That scene is worth the price of the Extended Edition.  The scene with the Witch King and Gandalf is also fantastic.  The added scenes of the development of the romance between Faramir and Eowyn allows for some closure to both charater's lives after the final battle.  I had doubts when I heard of the inclusion of scenes having Frodo and Sam dressed like and marching with orcs, but is worked out great.

The added and extended scenes are put in seamlessly.  You never feel like you are watching anything just for the sake adding in extra scenes.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the threatrical version and to anyone wishing for more elements from the books to be included in the movie.",1105401600,,1296,4.417721518987341

7274323,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"With 50 minutes of film that was not in the theatrical release of Return of the King, this director's cut should satisfy just about everyone.  Two important scenes, the murder of Saruman by Grima Wormtongue and the healing of Eowyn by Aragon, eliminate the gaps.  In addition, the meeting between Eowyn and Faramir actually takes place so we are not wondering why they are together at the coronation of Aragon and a tense scene where Frodo and Sam (dressed in armor as Orcs) are almost discovered by the enemy.  There are smaller restored scenes that, in retrospect, help to explain some details.  For example, why does Gandalf appear without his staff during the battle of Plennor Fields?  Because the Witch King appeared and shattered it!  This is not an essential scene but it adds detail.  Many battle scenes were included and gave the puffy-faced Orc commander who declares ""the time of the Orc has come"" some additional exposure, and we know who ends up killing him.

The Return of the King now runs to 4 hours and 10 minutes - unmanageable for movie theaters but perfect for home viewing.  If this film had been released 40 years or more ago the footage would have been lost.  The footage cut from Lawrence of Arabia was eventually restored but whatever happened to the film culled from Gone With The Wind?  So it is good to be having Peter Jackson's final cut of Return of the King even if you can't watch it all in one sitting.",1105315200,5,1436,4.6141732283464565

OTOH, if you want to see Gandalf embarassed even more, buy this version, because here, he has his staff broken by the Lord of the Nazgul.  Yikes.

As for the commentary tracks, if your movie is good, why need a commentary track?",1105315200,5,480,4.546511627906977
7274326,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"One of my favorite writers, who recently ended his own magnum opus, says that ""Ending is just another word for goodbye."" And so it is with the final release of the Extended Edition of ""Return of the King"" -- a bittersweet parting of ways at the end of a long journey.

Once again, as with the previous Extended Edition releases of ""Fellowship"" and ""Two Towers,"" the Extended Edition DVD of ""Return of the King"" gives audiences more to enjoy, not just in terms of the film itself, but with hours and hours of extras to give the viewer a rich and full experience with both the film and the phenomenon of ""Lord of the Rings.""

The film itself has about 50 minutes of footage not seen in the theatrical film, from small additions to scenes we saw in the theatre to entirely new scenes, all integrated seamlessly with  special effects and even new score elements created just for the extended DVD. Most prevalent amongst the new footage is the final confrontation with Saruman at Isengard, the Mouth of Sauron at the Black Gate of Mordor, and extra scenes with Aragorn and the Army of the Dead. All are handled masterfully, with the Mouth of Sauron scene perhaps adding the most complexity to what happens afterwards; this scene in particular really amplifies the emotional resonance of the final stand of the armies of the West at the gate of Mordor. The new footage overall serves to further steep the audience in the world of Tolkien, and deepen the emotional involvement viewers have with the characters and the story. The theatrical release did a fine job of immersing the audience already; this version only enhances and expands upon that.

The extras all maintain the standard already established in previous Extended Editions.  The commentary tracks are all enjoyable, with the cast commentary being perhaps the most all-out fun, less academic and more like a bunch of old college buddies getting together to relive to old days. Be sure to also find the Easter Egg on Disc One, which provides another glimpse into the camaraderie of the actors as a small prank played on one from another. The Appendices on Discs 3 and 4 give the devotee a veritable feast of production information and insights into the process of making the films, and the tension of finishing the last film on time in ""The End of All Things."" The best moments in the extras, however, are seeing the cast relive the World Premiere of the film in New Zealand, winning the Oscars, and shooting the final scenes for the extended edition in ""The Passing of an Age,"" and a surprisingly touching documentary about a young New Zealand filmmaker, Cameron Duncan, whose courage and dedication became the inspiration for the film's final song, ""Into the West.""

For the Gift Set extras, the Minas Tirith sculpture is intricate and beautiful, but what really sold me on getting the Gift Set rather than the less expensive one was the extra DVD: ""Creating the Lord of the Rings Symphony.""  The music of ""Lord of the Rings"" has been a huge part of what makes the films so wonderful to me, and my wife and I were privileged to see Howard Shore conduct the Lord of the Rings Symphony live in Seattle last summer, so when I saw that the Gift Set came with a DVD summarizing that experience, I knew I had to have it. Though the DVD is an abbreviation of the actual live symphony experience -- it's a little less than an hour long, versus about two hours for the actual syphony performance -- it's well worth seeing and really does a fine job of recreating the live feel, with some good commentary from Howard Shore to move it along. Whether you saw the Symphony and would like to relive the experience, or missed out and want an idea of what it was like, the ""Creating the Lord of the Rings Symphony"" DVD with the Gift Set is excellent.

Setting our feet on the path one last time, Peter Jackson has given us a new version of ""Return of the King"" to treasure, with new footage, new music, new extras, and all his heart as a filmmaker. The ""Return of the King"" Extended Edition is a fitting end to one of the greatest and most revolutionary masterpieces of filmmaking art to come along in a long time. The extra features will provide hours of enjoyment, and the film itself can be watched again and again, only enriching the story with each viewing.

But this is the end...this shall not happen again, in the same way. Time to say thank you to Peter Jackson and all of those who made ""Lord of the Rings"" such a magical experience. And so I say goodbye, here at the end.

Viggo Mortensen leads a cast of highly talented and unusual actors and actresses that include Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davies, and Elijah Wood. The movie begins with the story of Smeagol's finding of the One Ring, and his descent into darkness and despair, turning into the hideous Gollum.

We are then transported to the time the main story takes place, and we see Gollum leading Frodo and Sam on their treacherous journey in Mordor to destroy the One Ring. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, and the unforgettable Gimli are searching for the lost Merry and Pippin, who are recovering from a victory over the evil Saruman. This is avery beautiful movie, with awe-inspiring scenes involving Galdalf riding over the meadows of Middle-earth with his staff shining across the skies like a beacon of light. Viggo Mortensen does a beautiful job of the star Aragorn is trying to find his destiny, which we all know lies as King of Gondor.

The battle scenes are amazing. Peter Jackson did an amazing job of pulling it all together for this awe-inspiring three-and-a-half-hour movie. It is truly deserving of all 11 of its Academy Awards.

NOTE TO PARENTS: This is a very, very violent movie. Much of the movie is intense battle sequences featuring thousands of warriors marching at each other, and although it is not espescially graphic,(except for one scene with the Nazgul) you might want to think twice about this movie for kids under 12.",1105228800,4,1517,4.9411764705882355

As it is, the movie without these scenes seemed choppy and incomplete.

This new extended version makes for a much more satisfying viewing experience.  I especially enjoyed the extra scenes with Sarauman and Eowyn.

This series is a masterpiece, a monumental achievment.  J.R.R. Tolkien took a lifetime to write ""The Lord of The Rings.""

However, to my great pleasure, I discovered that one of the added scenes in this extended Platinum Edition adds greater tension to this film, renewing my love for this amazing work of art. Let me add that there are aspects of this film that improve through watching the film with the director/writer commentary on. I found myself being less disappointed about the content left out of the movie from the book and more moved by the story and especially the longer-than-expected ending. Ultimately, this third installation of the movie trumps the first two, which is saying a lot. After reading the book, and having watched this final extended edition, I am certain that I will never forget these characters. My appreciation for the story increased greatly by being able to experience the original movie and extended edition, and be a part of the obvious love for the story that the artists who put this movie together have for it. I can't recommend the extended editions enough and particularly loved this one.

It's hard to imagine a better treatment of a better story.

Peter Jackson finishes with the same respect for the original that was evident in the beginning.  In spite of changes required for film continuity (and most importantly, changes made for certain movie audience expectations) nearly every fan of Tolkien will appreciate the director's efforts.

In the story of the One Ring and the campaign to destroy it, there are strong emotions:  friendship, devotion, duty, love.  Tolkien evoked these feelings in the reader in words, painting scenes and creating characters on the printed page.  These scenes and characters live as powerfully on the screen, brought to life by a cast and a land equal to the task.

In the extended DVD version, several questions are answered and some events are fuller because of the fifty minutes of additional material not included in the theater version.  One of these is a short scene with Eowyn and Faramir that should never have been left out.

In the commentary section, cast members discuss some of these and how they felt about their exclusion.  The documentaries, interviews, and other special material add to the experience, but are extensive enough for a separate night of viewing.",1104883200,2,1331,4.95045045045045

While it was somewhat painful to wait for the Platinum edition of Return of the King, it was certainly worth it.  With an additional hour of material it further fleshes out the material and for the most part enhances the theatrical release. The culmination of the Ring saga is stunning in its scope; I can honestly say that this is the best 11+ hour film I have seen.  Everything about it works wonderfully, the cast and the story, the scoring, sound, effects, all combine for a lasting effect.  The extras on the DVDs round out the story with the frenzied race to the finish and the eventual Oscar sweep.  I originally felt that the final assault on Minis Tiris paled a bit compared to the raw savagery of the Helms Deep battle, but watching it repeatedly on DVD, it has won me over, there is so much to see, additional viewings are required.  I'm constantly amazed at how much richer the tableau, acting, effects mixture, music, and sound is in this trilogy vs Star Wars.  It's been quite an amazing journey and new accolades escape me, suffice to say it will likely be a while before something as epic as the Rings movies comes along again.  Highly recommended.",1104883200,3,1221,4.54337899543379
7274344,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"I did not seek out this movie, because I never could get into D&D

costume flicks. I suppose that the closest I came to being a potential reveller in these movies is that I am a fan of Ronnie James Dio's album ""Slaying the Dragon,"" but that really is quite a stretch.

First of all, the cinematography is gorgeous: Lots of light streaming in nooks and crannies and crevices. A lot of muted tones of pewter, forest green and cobalt blue -- it made me wonder why Peter Jackson didn't have it filmed in black and white; would have made more sense, but most people have an irrational aversion to black and white, particularly those who are epic movie fans.

The costumes and sets were very good and very believeable, as were the special effects. Lots of Indiana Jones stuff, but without Indiana Jones.

Mostly, though, my chief complaint is with the script and the acting. I'm sure glad that there was one reviewer here to tell me that this was about good and evil. I sort of got that from Elijah Wood running aroud everywhere toting this gold ring which has supernatural, but very unlucky powers. He really wants to get rid of it bad, sort of like a Medieval ""Talking Tina"" doll.

There's only one way to totally get rid of it, though, and that's why what otherwise would have been a half-hour ""Twilight Zone"" episode has been turned into a mini-series Renaissance faire that's longer than Wagner's (coincidentally) Ring cycle.

Actually, this plot would have been better as a Star Trek episode. After an hour of the ring causing Tribbles in the cargo hold and invading Klingons, Jim Kirk could have soliloquy'd:

""Got....to....get....rid...of...ring,"" whereupon Spock would have replied, ""Captain, the logical course of action is to send it back to the jeweler, and get a refund. It's still under warranty.""

However, this collection of celluloid deals with nerds before the

advent of daily bathing, though I often wonder, ""did this  fellowship of crusaders get their perfect 21st century teeth because the ring comes with a comprehensive dental plan?""

The main weakness of this movie is the acting. Sure, Sir Lord Knight Ian MacKellen gives a believeable performance as the Old Guy in the Witch's Hat. The rest of the movie, however, consists of a bunch of pretty fair haired lads and lasses who impart inscrutable piffle to each other in the form of deeply profound sounding monologues, delivered in a deeply anesthetizing monotone.  Everything is so gosh darned deep and weighty, but when these folks lock their glassy Jim Jones Unification Church

eyes, we in the audience are sure to know: ""Ah ha! Here comes another clue! Now we can get out our Little Orphan Bilbo decoder rings to try and figure out just what in Hades they're talking about!""

Now, this may be my fault. When I was in high school, I scoffed at the D&D playing, ""Chronicles of Narnia"" reading, Hobbit horse nerds. I was a more socially well-adjusted nerd, belonging to the far more sensible backgammon club and into new wave music like Devo and Duran Duran. So, I can't exactly relate to all this knights of the ringtable esoterica. So, if you're inclined to be one who's into this sort of thing, I'm sure it will have you on the edge of your seat, comparing the movie to the book.

But, for the unconverted, I really wish that the actors had been primed for these pictures by being forced to watch movies by Errol Flynn, Charlton Heston, Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles, to see how to breathe some life into their anemic performances. My God, it was as though the whole cast somnambulated their way through the script on Prozac. Heston wouldn't have done it that way. Oh, no: He would have had a ""damn it all to hell, you damn dirty apes are all made out of soylent green!"" moment or two.

Orson Welles would have waddled through the enchanted forest, drawling in Southern dialect some about how the corrupt ring could be bribed, and the dashing Olivier and Flynn would have swashbuckled away the dragons and flying monkeys from Wizard of Oz without even getting a run in their tights.

But, that would have been seen in this sophisticated era as less

profound and more entertaining. Entertaining don't get Oscars nowadays.

When -- after what had seemed almost an eternity -- I told my cousin ""I can't believe I sat through the WHOLE trilogy!"" -- he thereupon informed me I had only seen just ONE of the films. I passed on seeing the other two, fearing the strain on my faculties, and not having enough toothpicks to hold up my eyelids to keep me awake.

Instead, I did something far more exciting and less time-consuming: Counting every single blad of grass in my front yard with a magnifying glass and an abacus.",1104883200,5,4692,4.6918392204628505
7274345,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Once again, the Expanded Edition is quite superior to the theatrical version of the film.  It's hard to believe that they could improve something already so wonderful.  For the few extra dollars it takes to get this version of the film, there is enough material on these DVDs to keep you in front of your TV for two weeks trying to watch it all.  As a fan of the other LOTR:EEs, there was no way that I could pass this up!

There are mild spoilers ahead; so, if you haven't read the books or seen the film, skip these next three paragraphs.  As far as the extra scenes added to the film, I feel it was a little bit of a mixed bag.  Some of the additions I thoroughly enjoyed.  The extra scenes with the Path of the Dead, Gandalf versus the Witch King, and expansion of Eowyn's character were highly enjoyable.  Aragorn looking into the Palantir was a welcome addition.  Also, I thought The Mouth of Sauron was wonderfully creepy.  He looked like something out of a Clive Barker film.

Unfortunately, out of the three movies, this is the only time that a few of the extra scenes have disappointed me.  I don't know why, but the Death of Saruman and the Hobbits marching with the orcs fell a little flat with me.  I suspect it is because I am used to watching the theatrical version of the film, and those scenes will sit better after a few more viewings.  I found most the Gimli additions to be disappointing.  All the scenes added with his character reduced him to comic relief and, in my opinion, did not serve the story very well.

Gothmog still does not work for me, though his extended scenes make him a bit more intimidating.  Still, his weird mushroom head looks completely out of place from the other orcs, and his voice is like Dr. Claw from the old Inspector Gadget cartoons.  I am not one of those people who complain when a movie does not follow the book, but I think the filmmakers missed a big chance with the Houses of Healing.  There was incredible potential to add some drama or romance, and the scenes felt very rushed.  The movie is already so long, but another four or five minutes to play out Eowyn and Faramir's relationship would have been nice.  My complaints are very minor, and the things that bother me are just nit-picking, and do not detract from the enjoyment of the film as a whole.

Besides, after watching the two ""making of"" DVD's, there is no way to avoid appreciating the amount of work that went into these movies.  Seeing the incredible attention paid to detail on things that will be on screen less than a second (if at all) is amazing.  The first disc starts off by exploring the history of Tolkien, how the ""Silmarillion"" came about, and how it is connected to the rest of the series.  Any LOTR fan who hasn't read that book is really missing out on a wonderful story full of background information!  The documentaries continue from the first few discs, going into the work of WETA, the costume designers, and the set builders.  One of my favorite behind the scene's bit was about the horse training for the film.  I had never considered the incredible amount of work involved in training all of the horses to perform spot-on in the movie, and my respect for the filmmakers increased yet again.

The second disc has a ""wrapping up"" feel to it.  It goes into a very moving look at the final days of shooting the film, then adding the digital and sound effects, composing the music, and finally the premier of the film.  One of the most incredible moments is when Peter Jackson was filming the last pick-up shot of the movie.  He didn't want to say ""cut"", because that would be one of the final steps in the production of these movies, and he would have to leave this wonderful world.  Many fans can relate to that moment, knowing as this final DVD ends, there will be nothing more to come from this imaginative world that Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens passionately adapted from Tolkien's creation.  Counltess members of the cast and crew gave up several years of their lives to dedicate themselves to a wonderful work of art that they can be proud of, and will be remembered for a long time.",1104883200,2,4147,4.478029294274301

Thankfully, i tried out two towers and it brought back my faith that these could be good movies. My only knock on this movie was-for the love of God, cut the last 30 minutes. It was like a relative who stays too long at a Christmas party-sure you were happy to see them earlier in the night, but now its late and its time for them to go. The last 30 minutes offered nothing except a complete waste of my time.

7274349,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I purposely skipped the theatrical release knowing the Extended Edition (not necessarily Peter's absolute cinematic preference) would eventually hit the store shelves. I've seen the previous two EEs and both are world class DVD entertainment, so the RotK EE would have to bottom out hardcore for me not to feel gypped. I'm proud to say it is all the DVD I was anticipating.

The screenplay is all that I could expect given the film medium and artistic licenses. It's been mentioned ad nausea how Pete, Fran and Philipa (along with cast input) could interpret Tolkien's book and RotK is another admirable example when it's done right. The new or extended scenes flesh out the story better than if not included. Like the previous installments.

The video is sharp and should come as no surprise given the source technology responsible for its production. To try to find any more fault with as compared to FotR or the TT would be an exercise in futility. For that matter, the audio is blessedly awesome. It's demo reference perfect. And for those with DTS 6.1 home theatres, strap on your Frodo bib and smile ear to ear.

The concept of the two supplementary discs is prettyy much on par with the other two movies. In a nutshell, a (more than) thorough look at the total production of t he movie. It will take some viewers more than one or two sittings to digest the info. the DVD-ROM content is also fairly much on par with the other two.

The four seperate commentary track choices are once again worthy of one's time if willing. All you could wanna know from the different aspaects of the making of RotK. If there is one tiny annoyance, it's Dominic and Billy's slapstick routine. By the third installment, it gets tactless. Their humor was fun and timely at first with FotR, but they get just a little too comfy with the microphone, I realize four hours is a long time to listen to actors' memories. But their attempts at levity begin to cheapen what all have accomplished with the Trilogy. And I hope that's not forgotten all too quickly by today's fans.

But enough of that. For even around 30 bucks, the DVD is definitely worth it. They did not skimp out and again I thank New LIne Cinema for having the financial confidence in the Lord of the Rings. For Peter's vision and drive and imagination wouldn't mean squat if he didn't have the backing necessary to realize it. Buy. Now. Frodo lives. Just not at....",1104796800,7,2413,4.628504672897196

7274351,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this movie. It is quite possibly my favorite movie ever. Its great characters, story, special effects, and very good devotion to J.R.R. Tolkien's book make it very well worthy of your 4 hours' time.

  The theatrical version, which I only saw once (in the theater), was perfect and well worthy of its 11 Academy Awards. The extended edition improves on perfection with its flawless new and extended scenes, making the movie much more entertaining and understandable.

  The new scenes not only tie up loose ends, but they also spice up the story and make it more entertaining and exciting. The Voice of Saruman is one of the best new scenes, and I really don't know why it wasn't in the theatrical version. In the Company of Orcs is one of my favorites as well, showing much more of Frodo and Sam's difficulties in getting to the Cracks of Doom. The Mouth of Sauron was a very nice addition also. Eowyn's Dream is probably the least necessary of all the new scenes, as it doesn't convey anything of great importance to the audience, but it's not out of place or anything. The new scenes, for the most part, are pure pefection.

  The extended scenes give you more story, more special effects, and (this is my personal favorite) more fighting. All the extended scenes are excellent.

  The only thing that I am sad about that has to do with this film is that we've reached the journey's end to The Lord of the Rings. This movie is the crown jewel of the trilogy, the epic finish to Peter Jackson's near-perfect interpretation of J.R.R. Tolkien's perfect books.

  This version of the story really is a continuation of the dream begun by Tolkien and made visible for the ages by Peter Jackson and company.  If a single scene captures the essence of this entire trilogy it's not one of the great battles or one of the great speeches.  Rather it is that of Gandalf and the eagles appearing like a trio of angels to save Sam and Frodo.  The music with that visual chokes me up every time.
  The fellowship of the film has done us all a wonderful favor.  Now if only Peter can be persuaded to direct and star in The Hobbit.  Mark Addy would be my second choice to play Bilbo.",1104624000,,901,4.01123595505618

Do not expect a very different movie - it was not meant to be very different.  The extended version fills in gaps in the storyline, adds depth to characters and has longer and more graphic battle scenes.

However, the addition of the Gandalf/Saruman, Gandalf/Witch King, and Mouth of Sauron scenes both wrap up loose ends and add new meaning to the entire film.  Unlike the other two films, after watching the extended edition, it is almost impossible to watch the theatrical version of ROTK now.

When I was a kid, I'd rent videos and watch certain scenes over and over. Scenes with science fiction or fantasy characters so convincing that I'd have to dissect each shot meticulously.  The ED-209 scene from Robocop or the Darkness scene with Tim Curry from Legend both being examples where a blend of brilliantly scripted dialogue and great characterisation combined with beautifully executed special effects created emotive and convincing characters.

The LOTR trilogy is littered with such magic but the platinum extended edition of Return of the King has a new character in a new scene that had me repeatedly watching frame by frame over and over just like back in the top-loader VCR days.

The new scene with ""The Mouth of Sauron"" makes this box set worth the price alone. A tense, brilliantly scripted bit of dialogue with a great performance by Bruce Spence, bundled into one of the best pieces of film character design and subtle use of digital effects on ""The Mouth"" itself helps this version of the film shine.

I'm grateful that Jackman opted to include more footage of Eowyn's life and struggles.  You see her battling the Orc lieutenant, meeting Faromir, and showing her character in various ways.

In general, I believe the added scenes helped a great deal to illustrate the story more, but were not quite necessary for a theatre presentation.  The whole story is more than four hours long and will take several viewings to fully comprehend everything that's going on and what's been added.

7274366,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"This review presumes that the reader has seen the theatrical version of the Return of the King.  That movie as a whole was excellent, well-deserving of its critical and commercial success and 5 stars.  This review looks at the narrower question of how the extended and new scenes add to the original.

One of the flaws with the theatrical release was that, in order to trim the running time for audiences, scenes were removed that moved the plot forward in minor ways.  As a result, the finished product was a bit choppy.  The DVD corrects that in several key areas.

New scenes that work:

Why was the palantir sitting in the ruins of Orthanc? Explained

Why are Frodo and Sam in orc armor in one scene, out of it the next?  There is now the scene (directly from the book) ""In the Company of Orcs""

How do Faramir and Eowyn go from near death to in love?  The scene from ""The Houses of Healing"" is included.

Missed the Mouth of Sauron?  Well he's here, and this was one of the places where Jackson's departure from a literal retelling of the book worked best.  I still can't believe that this scene was cut.

New scenes that add little:

In some of the scenes that differ from the book, I prefer the book version, but recognize that the DVD version probably works at least as well.  Aragorn's use of the palantir falls into that category.  Sadly, the (continuing) omission of the Scouring of the Shire probably does as well.

New scenes that detract:

The extended scenes from the Paths of the Dead are unnecessary.  The theatrical version had a better impact.  The new scenes create repetitive plot elements and veer into Indiana Jones territory.  And finally, readers will be happy to learn that the goodbye scene at the end has NOT been extended.

Technical:

I recommend having the remote control handy, or permission to have the house shaking during the battle scenes.  The range of volume from battle to dialogue is very broad.  be prepared to either listen closely or annoy the neighbors.

So overall, the DVD provides a clear upgrade over the theatrical version.  Compared to the quality of the added/extended scenes in other films, this is far superior.  I would also rate it slightly better than the improvements in the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers.  A must-have for any true fan.",1104364800,5,2305,4.631188118811881

That was the reason the end scenes that seemed so long in the cinema now look just about right. What was worth 11 Oscars is now bigger and improved: once you see it you will not want to go back to the truncated version. I was lucky enough to see the Extended Editions of the first two films on a movie theatre also (they ran here before Return of the King opened), I just hope I get to see this one too.",1104364800,3,758,4.421428571428572

As a ""Tolkien purist,"" however, I was disappointed at seeing the way-too-early and totally different demise of Saruman. That signalled what I had feared most -- no Scouring of the Shire, where Saruman is supposed to get his just desserts.

You are missing almost 2/3 of the movie in fullscreen format.

7274370,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"I won't ever forgive Peter Jackson for this.  The overweight bespectacled New Zealander had extremely humble beginnings making nasty little black comedy horror films on shoestring budgets in New Zealand.  In their own way, they were wonderful.  Then, Jackson started to deviate towards what he considered serious filmmaking, and made a bloated ass of himself.  He capped off this depressing downward trajectory by assembling a huge cast and crew to attack and bastardize a beloved fantasy classic.  Today, Jackson can be spotted with an enormous gut, thick glasses and unkempt facial hair rhapsodizing about himself and what a genius he is.

Lord of the Rings could have been made into a cinematic fantasy classic almost worthy of Tolkien if, say, Terry Gilliam had been the director.  Unfortunately Jackson, a small-scale filmmaker taking on a very large-scale project, decided to cast a bunch of nobodies and some annoying B actors in the movies, make everything digitized and unconvinving, add unwanted and failed comic relief, add unwanted and failed sentimentality, and egotistically delete important parts of the trilogy to make room for scenes he pulled out of his bulbous posterior.

With each successive movie in the trilogy things became sloppier and sillier and more redundant.  By the third movie, just about everything looked like it came out of a slick video game - it all culminates in a really poorly edited 'battle' in which some computerized armies are projected around a miniature city and lots of antics with digitized elephants, trolls, battering rams, orcs, elves, ghosts and John Rhys-Davies ensue, all of which are devoid of tension, excitement, or conviction.  As if Jackson hadn't punished my poor soul enough, he tacked on a syrupy half-hour epilogue with hobbits bouncing around on beds and Ian Holm in lame old man makeup.  I hang my head and weep.  Please, Mr. Jackson, can't we have some more cheap, gory zombie flicks?

7274371,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"When I first saw this movie in theaters, I was impressed. There was a little bit of everything; romance between Aragon and Arwen, tons of bloody action, and an excellent plot (perhaps that's because I read the book, though). After watching the DVD, my opinions have only been enhanced. Many of the new scenes really do add that extra layer of depth I wanted, although I was dissapointed at the Mouth of Sauron scene, where (SPOILER!) Aragorn kills the Mouth of Sauron  (END SPOILER). That scene seemed to detract from the overall kingly impression I had of Aragorn, but it is a small trifle in such a great film.

The disks have excellent video quality, and the sound is, once again, superb. The 3rd and 4th disks have some very engrossing documentaries which really add some light to how the movie was made, and the sheer manpower that took to make it.

Overall, 5 Stars, because I was totally enthralled with it.

And in response to a previous reviewer, Gollum was entirely CG, so I fail to see how a ""zipper"" could be showing during costume changes. Most likely you mistook it for Gollum's spiney backbone.",1104278400,4,1109,4.642857142857143

They progresively got better... at times in the first one I got bored, but the second was way better, and now the Return of the King? AMAZING.  I only give it 4 stars because it was hard to follow at times, I expect it would have been easier to understand had I read the books.  Overall, one of the best movies I have ever seen.",1104278400,,504,3.9603960396039604
7274373,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Like the previous two extended versions this adds scenes and story that would have made the movie too long for the average film watcher but were sorely missed by fans of the novels.

You get to see Gandalf's confrontation with Saruman at the tower of Orthanc, but you don not see Saruman in his cloak of all colors. You get to see Aragorn confront Sauron through the Palantir of Orthanc and his confrontation and slaying of the Mouth of Sauron before the black Gate.

They have also extended many of the previous scenes including the journey through the Path of the Dead and you get to see the romance of Eowyn and Faramir.

The only major disappointment for me is that there is still no cleansing of the Shire. I understand why it wasn't done, but I am still greatly saddened.

The other bonus discs are also up to their usuall excellence. While they would not be my reason for ever buying a special DVD, it is interesting seeing how they brought Tolkein's dream to life.",1104278400,2,972,4.505681818181818

Once again Peter Jackson amazes audiences with breathtaking special effects and stunning scenery. He also repeats his formula for the preceding two films, that of including only those parts of the story that he either feels he cannot get away with ditching, or that will provide him with the excuse for his visual triumphs.

Jackson's version of Tolkien's story is a wonderful film, but anyone who wanted to know what all the fuss was about would come away from this disappointed. It would be fair to say that LOTR has not been filmed at all.",1104278400,11,646,4.863636363636363

The biggest letdown is Gollum. In this movie, they have changed the costume of the actor, so that you often can see the zipper of the outfit, this is very distracting.

The movie is OK for late nights when you have absolutely nothing else to do, but I have to give it a one star rating. Sorry.",1104192000,7,595,4.2105263157894735

Every frame of this movie feels not only like a work of cinematic art, it serves to move the story forward at a pace respective of the material yet urging, coaxing it forward so that its more than four hour length never once feels weighty or bloated.

Jackson seems well at home with his cast and the performances from every character - major and minor - ring with a dramatic truth so that they seemingly leap directly from Tolkien's pages.  With its potent mixes of adventure, fantasy, friendship and fear no emotion is spared or goes unchecked:  there are moments of pulse pounding terror, great comic relief, heartwarming as well as moments guaranteed to produce tears.  Return of the King brilliantly brings Tolkien's trilogy full circle and I cannot imagine a more satisfying evening of movie magic.",1104192000,7,952,4.881987577639752
7274379,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Return of the King is by far the best of the three movies in this trilogy -- hands down!  There are moments of true drama in this film that really tug at the emotions of the viewer:  the troubled relationship between Faramir and his father; the unrequited love of Eowyn for Aragorn; the reluctant warrior Theoden; the interaction between Gandalf and Pip; the sadness of Gollum; and of course, the heroic friendship between Sam and Frodo (which packs the most emtional impact in the entire movie).  This movie deserved every Academy Award it received, and Sean Astin deserved one for his portrayal of Sam.  Peter Jackson has done a wonderful job with this trilogy and I have no doubt these three films will have the staying power of the first Star War trilogy, and last for decades to come.  A note on the additional scenes:  I didn't really feel like they added much this time around.  With the other films, Jackson added new material that better explained events in the respective films, but with this movie they just seemed like nothing more than ""extras"" or ""deleted scenes"" you find on most DVDs.  They didn't take away from the overall film, but they added very little.  Regardless, this special addition is a must-have for any Tolkien fan, any fan of the Lord of the Rings.  I'm almost sad to see it come to end -- nor more LOTR films at the theatre each December; no more LOTR DVDs in the Christmas stocking. :(",1104192000,3,1418,4.591269841269841
7274380,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"I just got back from seeing RoTK today. I went with two friends (they say it last night at a sneak peek but this was my first viewing of it). The film is a major epic and highly memorable but it suffers from some major flaws. It glosses over the conclusion of Battle of Isengard, doesn't bother to explain the Palantir, contains some dry/poor acting and lines (mainly poor jokes revolving around Gimli and Legolas that do not get pulled off well), and the ending is highly inappropriate and disappointing in conjunction with the film.

The ending is great but not at the end of THIS film. The film contains one of the best battle scenes I've ever seen, akin to that from [i]Spartacus[/i], bringing viewers to an emotional high with adrenaline pumping but then goes into a ""where are they now?"" series of subdued scenes mainly with an orchestral (albeit incredible orchestral) piece serving as the main auditory feature excepting the last scenes in which some dialogue is jutted forth. Jackson attempted to utilize some of the novel's closure but it turned out to be poorly done/placed in this film.

On a more positive note, the film flowed incredibly well and had some of the best special effects I've seen recently in a film that has an overall solid performance (I'm thinking a 6 out of 10). I'd definately see it again in the hopes that it grows on me.",1104105600,,1356,4.622406639004149
7274381,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"No, This is simply put the greatest cinematic achievement ever undertaken. The only downside to these great films is that to truly experience the wonder you cannot take them separately, instead you must experience them as a whole. A daunting proposition, given the running time which , with the occasional break for sustenance might cost you 15 or so hours.

But those 15 hours would be the best 15 hours of your life. In all my 600 DVD collection, the three extended versions of LOTR are the most treasured, occupy the top shelf of the first DVD rack. There's a reason for that. Best experienced in DTS with a high end sound system. No need to review the content, as by now unless you are an isolated amazonian tribe in Brazil you have already read the accounts of these films.

One comment I must make, I don't get too emotional very often from film moments, but the moment where Aragorn , after being crowned King of all Men, tells Frodo and his hobbit companions that they bow to no one chokes me up, and Ive seen it 3 times already. That moment crystalizes the entire 3 film package for me, all the emotions I feel when watching the films come to a head at that moment. Its the single most spectacular, emotional, meaningful moment in any film of any genre I have ever experienced. Thank you Peter Jackson and thank you LOTR cast.

If by some reason you have been living under a rock, DO NOT PASS GO, DO NOT COLLECT $200, DO ORDER THIS DVD IMMEDIATELY.

7274382,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The mind can only absorb what the rear end can endure.  And at four hours, I could barely endure this film.  But in DVD form, pauses and stop makes all the extended versions of the LOTR trilogy bearable.  This is a good thing, since the LOTR trilogy is the greatest cinematic achievement ever.  Return of the King, the final chapter of this Tolkein tale, is as epic as Tolkien's vision.  In the history of film, few movies can approach LOTR; Metropolis maybe, Matrix no, Star Wars can't.  Nothing in Science Fiction or fantasy can compare.  This movie is a must have, especially in its extended form.

The extended versions of the LOTR films are far more entertaining than the theatrical productions.  It seems the first scenes that Peter Jackson cut from the theatrical runs were comedic relief.  In all the films, ROTK included, there is more laughter, more lighthearted scenes.  Also, the extended versions are great for those of us who haven't read the trilogy of Mr. Tolkien's.  In ROTK we find out what happens to that evil white wizard, what happens to Gandalf's staff, and we see many of the details that help include us into the Middle Earth world that the bookworms take for granted.  So at four hours, it's more of a pleasure.  See this film.",1104105600,4,1253,4.662100456621005
7274383,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"The 4-CD, Special Extended DVD Edition of RotK is available! No one will say you don't get a lot for your money. You can start watching it in high school and finish in old age. You pay only pennies per minute. But is it worth watching, even at so economical a rate?

 Some of it certainly is. Do not miss ""Home of the Horse Lords,"" one of the many appendices. This half-hour vignette is about the horses (and owners) who participated in LOTR. ""Home of the Horse Lords"" is charming, funny, moving, and interesting. And from these characteristics we can infer that Peter Jackson had nothing to do with it.

 The 76 scenes of the main feature (including 24 extended and 12 new ones) enshrine forever the Great Director's inability to tell drama from cheap sensationalism, his love of tawdry glitter, his littleness. Letting that man get his hands on Tolkien's trilogy was like putting a Stradivarius into the clutches of a destructive child.

 One could write a book on how bad it all is. Here I will just give one example: Watch scene 64, the Mouth of Sauron; then read pp. 182-185 of Volume III. I cannot believe that anybody who does this could possibly fail to see how low, how plebeian, how stupid,is the film when compared to Tolkien's moving and dramatic scene--a scene that could easily have been in the film, had it been directed by a man of taste.

 The Great Director found his true field when he made his horror films. That sort of thing is the limit of his abilities. It was a ghastly error to turn him loose on a piece of great literature. All the splendid work of the talented folks in New Zealand--the Weta Workshop, the costumers and armorers, the miniature- and set-builders, the dedicated extras--was in the end brought to grief because the director was a (very) overgrown adolescent whose talent was so very, very limited.

 What a pity. Now it may be decades before someone does it right.",1104105600,10,1906,4.595870206489676
7274384,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"As with so many other Tolkein fans out there, I've been anxiously awaiting this release and was finally treated to it after receiving it as a holiday gift.  By way of background, when I initially saw Return of the King in the movie theater (2 or 3 times), I thoroughly enjoyed it but was somewhat disappointed.  Generally, I felt that the filmmakers made certain decisions as to content (i.e., what to include and what not to include) that I would not have made.  Of course, the thing to realize is that the films are derivative of the original books and given the volume of material included in Tolkein's masterwork, it is impossible to include everything in the films.  Nonetheless, I could tell that there were several scenes in the theatrical version which would be expanded in the Platinum Series.

While the extended edition of Return of the King does not include ""everything I would liked to have seen,"" it adds so much flavor to an already brilliant film.  For anyone who loves Tolkein or anyone who never read Tolkein but loved the movies, this (and each of the extended editions) are must-haves.  My favorite added/extended scenes are:  (i) the additional details concerning the many battle scenes; (ii) the Mouth of Sauron scene; and, (iii) the scenes w/ Frodo and Sam in Cirith Ungol and Mordor. I was somewhat disappointed with the scene in which ""Aragorn Masters the Palantir"" (started out well but the ending was not in keeping with the character of soon-to-be King Elessar).  Likewise, ""the Voice of Saruman"" scene fails to included Gandalf's warning re: the pursuasiveness of the wizard's voice).  The ""Hour of the Witch King"" also left something to be desired although I loved the courage and bravery of Shadowfax).  Also, it would have been very useful to the plot had the filmmakers included a scene with Denethor using the Palantir of Minas Tirith -- it would give newcomers to Tolkein a better understanding of what drove the Steward to madness.  Finally, it would also have been fun to see a scene at Cirith Ungol where Sam breaks the ""Will of the Watchers.""

I know I'm a harsh critic because I love the books so much but, all in all, this was a wonderful adaptation.  Beautifully done.  Waiting anxiously for Peter Jackson and crew to get working on the Hobbit.",1104105600,11,2286,4.766497461928934
7274385,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I waited with great trepidation three years ago when The Fellowship of the Ring was released.  I had read The Lord of the Rings over a dozen times (once a year since I was in middle school) and was convinced that it could never be successfully adapted for film - especially as a live action movie.  I had seen Bakshi's disaster, so plodding and uninteresting that I could not bear it more than once.  I had seen the Rankin/Bass version of The Hobbit and The Return of the King.  All of these tellings had me thoroughly convinced that I would not ever see a strong adaption for Tolkien's works on the silver screen - yet I yearned for one.  There's something innately satisfying about books being made into film if done well, but there was a creeping doubt in my heart about any adaptation.  An even greater when arose when someone I never heard of began making the movies.  Couldn't they have gotten Spielburg or someone with a solid Hollywood track record.  Happily, I was very wrong in this instance.  Peter Jackson is the only one who could have done it.

So, here at last is the Extended Edition of Return of the King.  Taken in as a whole, the film is magnificent on it's own - but as a piece of the puzzle it is all the more extraordinary.  The Lord of the Rings is the greatest accomplishment in cinematic history.  With the three films, Jackson has managed to do what many thought impossible: successfully translate the greatest book of the 20th Century to screen.  From the casting, to the effects, to the script, to the selection of the composer (Howard Shore's scores are brilliant - all the more so because he's not attempting to be John Williams) everything is amazing.

The extended cut of RotK adds quite a bit of depth and changes the pacing.  True, some tension is taken away by adding more to the Paths of the Dead but we also get some added excitement and tension during that phase.  We see more of Denethor and Faramir's tale.  We see the sadness of Eowyn.  We see Saruman's arrogance and Wormtongue's hatred of him.  I certainly prefer the extended cut - especially because it allows you to stay in middle earth for an extra fifty minutes, though sadness still grips you at the Grey Havens, as it should.

The extras here are up to par with the other sets.  Hours and hours of info on Tolkien, on making the films, on wrapping them up, and the story about the inspiration to the beautiful song that closes out the film, ""Into the West"".  A touching story about a young film maker who's life is taken by cancer.  You can see PJ tearing up towards the end, and that really says it all.

It took great heart to make this movie (I'm talking about all three partitions in one).  Thank you to PJ, Fran, and everyone at New Line who stepped out with the cash at the beginning.  You have been rewarded for your faith - as has the rest of the movie watching world.  Most of all, however, Professor Tolkien must be thanked for his great contribution to literature and imagination.  He was a wonderful writer who, I think, never understood it when his works became so popular.  His understanding of the world played a huge part.

So, in conclusion, buy this DVD.  You already know whether you like Lord of the Rings or not.  If you're here, you likely do - so buy it if you haven't already!",1104105600,8,3300,4.437603993344426

(I.e., not in the book). The most important loose end, the Three Rings, is left almost as afterthought and even then it wasn't gotten right.

There's no doubt that these are all incredible films and they have been my happiness for three years--I'm sorry to see them end.  That being said, I have to say that, for the most part, I consider the theatrical version of ROTK somewhat superior to the Extended Edition--something I never would have heard myself saying about FOTR and TTT.  Oh well...no matter, really, it's a joy to have the additonal material; a joy to see some of the other possiblities for certain scenes...and a few of the new scenes are truly worthwhile  (my personal favorite is the chance to see Christopher Lee and Brad Dourif one more time in ""The Voice of Sauroman"" which is a scene very faithful to the spirit of Sauroman's death in the book).  The wonderful thing is, you'll always have the choice between the EE and the Theatrical version.

7274393,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Already impressed by the theatrical cut of this film, I was most intrigued when I heard that the Extended Edition of the film was coming. My favorite film last year was the Return of the King, and I was most pleased when it swept the Oscars last year. This cut of the film is, in my opinion, downright better than the version that had swept both the cinemas and Oscars this year. The scenes make it less of a conclusion to a single, 12-hour film which the theatrical cut was and more of a film which acts as both a conclusion to a trilogy and a very good film in its own right. The extra scenes make for a much more filling cinematic experience, letting this film stand on its own. Much-needed comic relief comes in the form of a drinking game at Edoras in the beginning, and more wisecracks by Pippin at Minas Tirith. The Saruman scene is by far the best added scene, adding both drama and entertainment to an already great film. It also provides as foreshadowing for the rest of the film. Some may complain about the subtlety and the short length of the Gandalf/Witch-King confrontation, but I personally thought it was fine. I also enjoyed the Aragorn/Sauron confrontation within the Palantr. Overall I'd say that this is probably the best DVD in 2004 (With the exception of the long-awaited Star Wars trilogy, of course). I did not even mention the extras and special features, which are warmly welcomed after the sub par extras of the first edition of The Return of the King.

The violent demise of Saruman and Grima Wormtongue.  A jarring exchange at the Black Gate with the ""Mouth of Sauron"" (oh, for a good dentist).  Brief, fleeting glimpses at the blossoming romance of Eowyn and Faramir.  Frodo and Samwise, clad in Orc garb and deep within the festering bowels of Mordor, suddenly absorbed into a most dysfunctional brigade.

And those are just for starters.

The extended version of THE RETURN OF THE KING wonderfully and successfully enhances, augments, and improves the Academy Award-winning theatrical release; its special features and enticing appendices make watching this stuff an absolutely unforgettable experience.  As examples:  We learn why the ""Scourging of the Shire"" was not included; how Tolkien himself was influenced by the wanton carnage of World War I; the overwhelming emotions of the actors as they concluded their roles after more than four furious years of filmmaking--heck, we even get to watch a gigantic prosthetic oliphant get made and then transported, piece by piece, via dozens of trucks, to some windblown pasture, where it becomes the world's largest movie prop.

No wonder I haven't showered in days.

This extended version is the granddaddy of its two predecessors--a shining triumph of entertainment guaranteed to enchant and delight.  Pay close attention to the actors' voice-overs of the extended film; you will laugh, giggle, chuckle (what a witty group they are)--but you will learn, and absorb, a ming-boggling amount of information.  Most highly recommended.

7274396,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"As a confirmed Tolkienite, I rate this movie Very High!

Although the extended version is quite lengthy, the scenes that Mr. Jackson re-introduced into the theatrical release are key and essential to the understanding of the movie and complement and don't detract from this masterful piece of work one bit.

Although some of the scenes are not verbatim from the book, they take the spirit and meaning and mold it into something that I believe J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud to call his own.

This is a must-have for anyone that wants to purchase the Return of the King Volume.

Oh, the statue of Minas Tirith is incredible! A very nice edition to my collection!!!",1104019200,3,662,4.730434782608696
7274397,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Peter Jackson's ambitious and successful adaptation of JRR Tolkien's classic novel gets a whopping 50 extra minutes as well as the plethora of commentaries and features that graced the previous two extended editions of the trilogy as well.  With it, the cinematic saga is concluded-at least until (both fingers crossed) Jackson gets a chance to make ""The Hobbit.""  The longer version is superior, in my opinion.  The cuts were no doubt necessary for the success of the theatrical version, but it's nice to be able to immerse oneself in a more complete and complex retelling of the saga.  A prime example is Christopher Lee's final scene as the evil Saruman.  Perhaps it's not essential to the telling of the story, but it features very good work by a veteran actor and helps us to understand how the Palantir got into the hands of our heroes.  The ""Lord of the Rings"" films are difficult to beat for sheer entertainment and spectacle, and the extended DVD sets are worthy items./",1103932800,,979,4.7976190476190474

7274399,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"The movie was, for most folks, a fun watch.  I was too irate to enjoy it the first time I watched it in the theater.  I settled down a little the second time, but was still disappointed.  I had a small hope the extended edition would redeem it, but no luck. The main reason is that the major problems with Jackson's third movie were not subtractions (which even extreme purists like me can forgive, because you can't tell the whole story in 9 hours) but additions, which served no purpose and detracted from Tolkien's tone and purpose.

The Fellowship of the Ring was a very good movie and a very good adaptation, all things considered.  The Two Towers departed in a number of more substantial ways, sacrificing story for foolish notions about what audiences will pay for (instead of realizing that a great story doesn't need to be embellished) and setting the stage for a major decline in the Return of the King.  The writing on this gets 2 stars, because I'm in a generous mood.

The visual effects, in the theatrical and extended versions, were fantastic, but less so in Return of the King than in the previous two movies.  The Mumakil are not quite up to par, nor are the dead.  The antics of Legolas in particular are more farcical and less well-done than the in the previous movies (I thought riding a shield down the stairs at Helm's deep was excessive, but slinging around on a Mumak?--come on, it looked as realistic as the scenes from Disney's Tarzan swinging and sliding on vines). 4 Stars for the effects -- very good, but not up to par with the previous 2 movies.

Some of the extended material seemed OK, but none was essential at all and none redeemed the butchering the story underwent at the hands of some apparently very poor writers. Often the extended scenes were butchered as well.  An example would be the Witch King shattering Gandalf's staff during their showdown -- entirely uncalled for, and ignoring Tolkien's portrayal of the White Wizard.  Some were only so-so, like the scene with Saruman -- not anywhere near as good as the corresponding scenes in the book, but not horrible.

On the other hand, the charge of the Rohirrim at the Pelennor, and the wave of riders crashing into the Orcish lines, was worth the price of the set by itself - still not as powerful as the book, but really really good nonetheless -- good enough to give me goosebumps each time I see it.

Whether you you have read the books or not, I would recommend seeing this, but if you enjoyed the books, you will almost certainly be disappointed with many aspects of this movie.",1103932800,9,2576,4.571739130434783
7274400,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"So much has been said and written about Jackson's LOTR that I want to keep my contribution brief and clear.

1) All in all I have greatly enjoyed the three films, and, while  I'm aware that, as with any work of art, LOTR cannot conform 100% to the individual viewer's taste, I found only minor causes for criticism-- except one: The killing of the Mouth of Sauron by Aragorn. In my opinion this one brief moment badly harms, almost ruins the credibility of the whole trilogy. With one swift stroke, the king-to-be here loses his dignity, moral integrity, and sense of justice, the most important attributes of a ruler. If only for a moment, he gollum-like displays his cowardly and inhumane lower self and (in my opinion) forfeits his right to wear the crown of Gondor. There was no need for this scene-- it is contrary to the spirit of all the rest of the movies (and the books). On first watching the extended version it shocked me so much that I had difficulty savouring the ending. Okay, it's only a movie, but ... what a pity. :-(

2) My second remark concerns the bonus material, which (like with the other two dvds) conveys the exceptional commitment and cooperation of both cast and crew and the wonderful spirit Peter Jackson was able to generate and maintain among the team for so long. On watching and listening to all the enthusiastic interviews and moving footage witnessing people's dedication and friendship, I can't help hoping that this same collective, positive energy will also inspire other groups working on more serious issues such as famine, AIDS, climate change, or deforestation. The LOTR project is the living example of what true commitment can achieve; that lesson in itself is extremely precioussss! :-)",1103932800,4,1732,4.805369127516778
7274401,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"There is one HUGE message that is carried over to yours truly in this DVD set - particularly on the Appendices on discs 3 and 4 - What am I going to do with MY life? I so am overwhelmed by the sheer dedication put into the making of this epic, that it moves me to ponder what I can do, what good thing could I leave this world before I pass on?

What's not to love about this work of art and its backstory?

From the way Viggo Mortensen completely immerses himself in his role by bonding with his co-actor horse in real life and making that extra effort to enhance the friendship and love with his co-stars, to the way the fans in New Zealand (and around the world for that matter) made so much effort to celebrate the Premiere... From the moralistic storyline of compassion, friendship, dedication and honour in the script itself to the inclusion of an inspiring homage to a young moviemaker in New Zealand who died of cancer (whose story inspired the film's end theme song, 'Into The West')... every single thing in this DVD is inspiring and entertaining. It sets the bar to the highest possible level, and no matter what I do in my lifetime, no matter what field of work I am in, I would want to do the job as well as Peter Jackson and his team did for Lord of The Rings.

I am in awe of the people who made these films. Their story runs parallel to the movie itself, and their journey is in itself a wonderful tale.

As for the extended movie itself, I have to say that it certainly makes The Return Of The King more complete. Because of the added scenes, you get to see what happened to Saruman (Jackson and co's take on it, that is, modified from the original book but in keeping with the important bits), you get the whole 'theme' of the returning of the days of the King even more enhanced, and of course you get a really cool and wicked new character - the Mouth of Sauron (eventhough the scene wasn't as long as I had hoped.... picky picky!)

Writing reviews for this product in order for people to buy it is probably redundant... because it's such a ""must-have"" item, especially if you're an owner of a DVD player or a fan of fantasy, and further glorifying Tolkien and Peter Jackson and his crew is also probably redundant because they did after all win all those Academy Awards for the film, BUT as a scholar of the arts myself I just have to express my deepest respect and admiration for them.",1103932800,2,2407,4.304635761589404

The scene were Aragorn masters the palantir is okay but not too great. Yet again Peter Jackson added another scene with Arwen in the palantir but that's not a big deal.  The other scene where the Witch King breaks Gandalf's staff is kind of annoying----- that never happened in the book---- but again, it is still an okay scene.  The battle sequences were added to with lots of fighting goodness, and the Houses of Healing are a great addition too.  This is only some of the new stuff, but the rest is of the movie is great.

7274404,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Well, we waited long enough, and now we have the last ""Extended Edition"". Seeing that there are already 300+ reviews on this so far, I'm not sure what I can add, but here goes.

First of all, if you already like the movie, then you will like this edition too. There are a couple of head-scratching moments when scenes are changed from day to night, and this is problematic, because such moments really remove the viewer from the ""film experience"", that is, you start watching whats happening in the film instead of being immersed in it.

I'm not going to go into any ""This actor is great, this actor is terrible"" commentary. I assume people are capable of forming their own opinions!

The picture quality is superb, up to the quality of the previous volumes. This is quite an accomplishment, considering that there is even MORE material than on the previous two extended editions!

4 hours and 10 minutes is a LOT of movie. Good grief.

The sound quality is superb. If you are so lucky as to have a DTS 6.1 receiver that uses the discrete back channel, there's lot to show off with.

I can live with a lot of revisions to the story, I don't mind the loss of Tom Bombadil and others, but losing the scouring of the Shire is just too much. The added scene with Saruman and Wormtongue was implausible, without motivation, and really useless, IMO. It did not improve the film for me. (For those of you who haven't read the books and who wonder why there is so much whining about this, it's because the scouring of the Shire is the wonderful ending, where the four hobbits show how much their travels have changed them.)

The added scenes with the dead army were great. Best added scenes yet.

The special features are always well done and tasteful. Whoever is editing these together has watched the Star Wars dvds and realized that calling the director a genius every 5 seconds is no way to make a documentary. Rather, the focus is on the hard work and dedication of all the people involved.

I'll say it again - why bother putting art and photo galleries on a dvd? Who can actually see any details?

Packaging is nice and sturdy, and the disc holders have improved.

All in all, a package that will not disappoint. If you enjoyed these movies, then you pretty much need this. If you haven't seen any of them, you probably should rent them first.",1103846400,4,2342,4.5
7274405,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"Pros-

Saruman and Gandalf scene at beginning was excellent and worth the price alone.

The Mouth of Sauron was interesting and I highly anticipated this scene, but, as said in the extras, it is impossible to duplicate the tension of the book in this scene because in the book you don't know what has happened to Frodo yet.

The earthquake of skulls in the Paths of the Dead was stunning (but possibly slightly over the top when they envelope the trio).

Surprisingly, no extra endings.

Cons -

It seems to me that some of the sequences of battle scenes were changed. The battle doesn't flow as well, especially at the end when it is drawn out so that Gothmog is fighting Eowyn and then Aragorn walks by and kills him. Somewhat anticlimactic for Eowyn to fight Gothmog after she killed the Witch King, but I am nitpicking.",1103760000,2,823,4.5646258503401365
7274406,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The Mouth of Sauron scared the heck out of me...literally! Possibly tegh creepiest thing ever to captured on film!

7274407,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"Evaluating the three films of the ""Lord of the Rings"" presents the reviewer with a bit of a conundrum.  By what standard should they be judged?  To hold them to the standard of the text would be absurd because it is simply impossible to reduce it to nine, or even twelve hours of film.  However, with such a beloved classic, one does have the right to expect a certain adherence to the spirit of the work, something which was superbly captured in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"".  Unfortunately, ""Return of the King"" drifts further and further from the themes of Tolkien's works, and while it is still an excellent film, it doesn't quite live up to the expectations set by the first two films in the trilogy.

Nonetheless, the film has more to commend it than not, so I will begin with the positives.  First, one cannot discuss these films without considering the visual effects, and once again, ""Return of the King"" leaves the viewer with jaws agape.  From enormous Mumakil to breathtaking battle scenes involving tens of thousands of characters, the movie is a visual triumph.  At the same time, though, Jackson has once again wisely subverted visual elements into a more personal story, thereby avoiding the empty-headedness that often plagues special effects extravaganzas.

In particular, his portrayal of Theoden and Eowyn is masterful.  Every one of their scenes is dripping with Tolkien's language and themes, and  both Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto provide scene stealing performances.  Hill, with his portrayal of a king tormented frailty and loss captures a Theoden that is almost Shakespearean in his bearing.  Likewise, Otto becomes Eowyn as she seeks to subsume her unrequited love for Aragorn in death on the battlefield.  Eowyn's showdown the Witch King is perhaps the best scene of all three films, with Otto absolutely pouring herself out onto the screen.

Other highlights include the portrayal of Frodo and Sam's brutal passage of the Plains of Gorgoroth and their ascent of Mount Doom.  Grace through suffering was a critical element in Tolkien's work, and Jackson clearly appreciated this as he wrings brilliant performances from Elijah Wood and Sean Astin.  Finally, the strained and warped relationship between Denethor and Faramir is nicely captured, and well framed within the context of the larger story.

Finally, the coronation scene, while not entirely true to the book, is Tolkien-esque in every way.  Aragorn's simple, yet powerful tribute to the hobbits captures in everyway the ancient nobility of his line even as it speaks to Tolkien's view of the hidden greatness of the common man.

Alas, as I have indicated, all of these elements, as well as a superb ensemble cast, are rather let down by critical misunderstandings of Tolkien's work and themes.  First and foremost among these is the arrival of the Army of the Dead at the Battle of Pelennor Fields.  Readers of the novels will note that they only travel with Aragorn to the mouth of the Anduin where they capture the Corsairs of Umbar.  At that time Aragorn holds their debt fulfilled and travels north with Gondorian soldiers and volunteers.  Thus he has relieved the pressure on Gondor with, but not eliminated it.  By moving the Army of the Dead to Gondor, and making them invincible, Jackson has rendered the sacrifice of the Gondorians and the Rohirrim for naught.  Theoden in particular could have just sat tight for a few more hours, menacing Sauron's flank and waiting for the ghosts.  As I have said, Theoden and Eowyn tower in this movie, but their performance at Pelennor Fields is somewhat diluted by the eventual arrival of an invincible army.

That's the primary flaw on the theatrical cut, but there are many more in the extended and new scenes.  Most glaring is Aragorn's disgusting decapitation of the Mouth of Sauron which completely debases his character and is at polar opposites with the intent of the scene as written by Tolkien.  Likewise, the final scenes with Saruman are so out of character that Jackson was wise to cut them, and there is no real gain from their presence in this edition.  Finally, the drinking contest between Gimli and Legolas, in spite of offering some funny one liners, ultimately degrades both characters.  Gimli in particular, who had been effectively used as a sincere by light-hearted character is transformed into a buffoon.

There are a few nice additions, most of which are in the form of extended shots of various battles.  Of particular note is the showdown between Gandalf and the Witch King, a critical scene in the book and one which Jackson has captured quite nicely.  Also, the blossoming of Faramir's relationship with Eowyn in the House of Healing is a little brief, but still a well shot piece of exposition that fleshs out the film for people unfamiliar with the book.

The extras are, as with the prior two releases, superb.  The format is the same: documentary, adaptation, visual effects, etc. so I won't dwell on them at length.  However, one particular piece is worth noting, the half hour or so devoted to the training of the horses used in the film offers and interesting glimpse into an element of film-making that often goes overlooked.  Sure to be a delight for horse lovers, it is likewise fascinating for animal lovers in general.

Ultimately, ""The Return of a King"" is a good movie, and nothing I said in this review should detract from that.  Given the scope of the novels, and the time constraints, Jackson produced a powerful film that was entirely deserving of the awards lavished upon it.  Nonetheless, critical changes to the work, particularly in the extended edition, somewhat diminish this film when compared to its two predecessors.  Thus, when judged by his own tremendously high standard, Jackson fell a little short, but I still look forward to the day we hear he is going to direct ""The Hobbit"".

7274408,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"OK, so the story isn't all as the book tells it.  It is still a very good story in it's own right, and adding the extra only enhances the experience.

One can go on about the story, the characters, etc., but I wanted to focus on THIS release.  I love the movie.  I think it is one of the great epic films of all time.  I find it uses technology and the skills of many arts to tell a story so that they never seem to take it over.  It is in that aspect that I wanted to mention what I found to be a flaw in this release.

<Possible Spoiler Warning>

A brave captain heads back out to confront the Orc army on a suicide mission.  The Steward of the Throne of Gondor has dinner, and asks his new ""Guard of the Citidel"" to sing him a song.  As the song begins, (at least on the DTS 6.1 soundtrack) a high piched artifact can be heard that was noticable enough to pull me out of the film and look for something wrong.

<End Spoiler Warning>

With the exception of the disk switch (I wish there was a DVD standard to automatically swap disks on DVD changers) no other part of the film ever caused me to be distracted.  The sound in question is on the high end of the audible range and may not be noticable on all but the finest equipment or by those with a more restricted range of hearing.  Certainly it does not cause any major problem, it is simply an annoying noise that I found broke the immersion of the moment.

I also found that I needed to boost the rear center channel a little, but that could have been more to the fact that there is very little 6 channel source out there and I might not have had it well balanced to begin with.  This was not something I found in watching the film, but in using a selected scene before I settled in just to verify the sound settings were balanced.  This is more of a personal choice than a technical one.  To be honest I don't remember any spectacular rear center moment, which is exactly what you expect as it should just enhance the show before you, not having you look all over the room.

Peter, go through your soundtrack with a better ear.  One such audio glitch really does have an impact when it pulls the audience out of what is otherwise a very dramatic and emotional moment in the film.",1103673600,2,2236,4.143851508120649

These new scenes really make it a completely different movie than the theatrical version, providing greater depth and detail to existing storylines, as well as wrapping up loose ends.  Among the scenes added back in are:

1) the Final fate of Saruman and Grima Wormtongue.  Many were upset that this was left out of the theatrical version but it's worth the wait.

2) The Witch-King confronts Gandalf...short but powerful scene

3) Aragorn confronts Sauron through the Palantir...again a short but powerful scene.

4) The Fellowship is confronted by the Mouth of Sauron before the Black Gate.  Great scene and while some disgree with Jackson diverting from the source material, I think it worked well.

5) the budding romance between Faramir and Eeowyn.

6) Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli encounter the Corsairs of Umbar and we see how they got aboard their ships.

And there's much more such as extended scenes of orcs and Urak Hai's fighting amongst themselves in the tower of Cirith Ungol, more from the Battle of the Pellennor Fields, and more in the city of the Dead.

Tolkien purists tend to get up in arms about changes but I think Jackson has done a great job in balancing things that needed to be changed for dramatic purposes but still staying faithful to the source material.

No...there was no ""Scouring of the Shire"" but we did get a glimpse of this when Frodo peered into Galadriels mirror in ""Fellowship""  Even with each movie running 3 1/2 to 4 plus hours you simply could NOT included everything and certain things had to be streamlined.  Comparing it to Star Wars is utter nonsense as the Rings trilogy did a far better job of maintaining continuity and character development.

Return of the King does justice to Faramir, in particular, who came off like a bit of a jerk in The Two Towers.  His interaction with his father Denethor was the most tragic part of the movie.

Along with the extended edition you get FOUR different commentary tracks although I admit to have never listened to more than two.  You get a number of documetaries and featurettes with over 7 hours of material.

Everything from the building of the huge sets and ""Big-atures"" to designing the props, costumes, finding locations, special effects, music, training the horses, etc....

There are interactive maps to follow the path of the various characters, abandoned film concepts, huge design and still galleries, and much more.  This is a set, like the ones that came before, that will keep you busy for days going through all the goodies.

7274411,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"I don't think this extended edition adds much to the theatrical version; certainly it is not as big an improvement as the extended editions of the first two films.  It does make it...longer.

From every technical angle, the entire series is a wonder.  What has bothered me increasingly, ever since FotR, is Jackson's laziness in screenplay and script.  He and his co-directors/writers increasingly substituted their own dialog and story ideas, which are only one step above the leaden drivel found in the Star Wars films, for Tolkien's beautiful prose and plot.  With effort, they could have produced a great film which didn't require inflicting such indignities on Tolkien's opus.

When I saw there was a Corsairs of Umbar scene, I prayed Jackson had removed the excruciating and senseless scene where the Army of Dead annihilates the whole attacking force at Minas Tirith (making the valor of everyone else, from the Rohirrim, to the defenders of the city, and Aragorn himself, pointless).  No such luck.

I hoped the EE would include the powerful and beautiful scenes in the Houses of Healing (first with Aragorn as a healer, then between Faramir and Eowyn).  Instead we get a throwaway of Aragorn daubing Eowyn's brow, and one line of dialog between Faramir and Eowyn.  More screen time is devoted to the offensive and idiotic ""drinking game"" between Legolas and Gimli than to these two scenes combined.

We see Aragorn beheading the Mouth of Sauron during a parley, when the scene as written by Tolkien (with the Mouth of Sauron revealing his inner cowardice and Aragorn displaying his nobility) was far, far better.

And of course, with the omission of the Scouring of the Shire (which was never even filmed), Jackson manages to completely miss the point of the entire trilogy.

There are a few good new scenes.  The conclusion of the Saruman plotline, despite (again) violating Tolkien's vision, was better than I expected.  The scenes between Pippin and Faramir, and Faramir and Denethor (with a cameo by the ghost of Boromir) were good.  The additional Paths of the Dead footage was welcome, until it degenerated into self-parody with the avalanche of more skulls than the entire population of Middle Earth.

As the editorial review noted, Jackson made the right cuts (but not the right script/screenplay decisions) in the theatrical version, so there is little here that truly adds to it.

Sadly, short of major reworking to cleanse the screenplay of Jackson's ""improvements"", and additional filming, his effort will never be a faithful and satisfying telling of the most popular tale of the 20th century, despite the great casting, costuming, props, special effects, cinematography, and everything else.",1103673600,16,2714,5.101809954751131
7274412,1,B00Z9YZRVE,"Peter Jackson knows nothing about J.R.R.

I shudder to think that these movies will be, for many people, ""The Lord of the Rings,"" while Tolkien's wonderful books lie forgotten, replaced by celluloid trash.

As their own story, Jackson's films are certainly well made, but not one of them is deserving of the title ""The Lord of the Rings,"" so unfaithful are they to the trilogy.  For the love of all that is holy, read the books and forget about Jackson's terrible retelling.",1103587200,17,626,5.178217821782178
7274413,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"As far as ROTK and the series goes, Jackson did all right. I generally agree with most of the points made in the positive reviews, and even a few of the negative ones to some degree. And I could have done without the Legolas ""eXtreme"" skate-rail grind on the shield scene, and I think there were a few too many shots of grime-covered orcs and Uruk-Hai snarling (do they snarl 24/7?). And certainly, Saruman and Wormtongue were poorly portrayed. However, Elijah and Sean nailed their characters (no pun intended relating to the homoerotic relationship between Sam and Frodo) as best as anyone could have hoped, McKellan was perfect, and the production values soared like deus ex machina eagles. ;-)

It's not perfect, but as a whole a respectable adaptation. I left feeling more impressed with the visuals than any psychological gravitas (say, the way Apocalypse Now left me emotionally drained) but it's hard not to recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Tolkein and the fantasy genre. It's an epic popcorn series that goes several layers deeper than any Schwarzenegger fare could have hoped.

However, what irks me isn't the flaws of the trilogy. It's the marketing types who you KNOW will soon create several ""new editions"" of the entire trilogy year after year to bait purists into shilling out more cash for what they essentially already have. I predict by Xmas 2005, there will be an all-encompassing edition of all three films in one collector's set, and--mark my words--it'll have a few more extras to entice reselling the same product again to the same people. Wonder where those shire scouring scenes went? Just wait... And then comes the DivX version. and then the Superbit version. And then the Enhanced Superbit version. And then the Hi-Def version. And then the Hi-Def Collector's Edition. And then the 10th Anniversary Edition, signed by Peter Jackson, and including yet more scenes that weren't added to the previous 9 editions, plus a nude picture of Liv Tyler for fanboys. And... ad nauseum. Grr. Sure, caveat emptor and all, but one has to acknowledge the continuing rampant greed and lack of ethos.

So I say screw the evil marketing types. Don't buy the DVDs. Rent the latest version X from NetFlix.",1103587200,,2221,4.901595744680851
7274414,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Forgive my my lack of spelling ability when it comes to the character's names!

The Return of the King extended version lives up to the hype beautifully.  It's true that none of the extra footage is needed, the theatrical cut tells the story perfectly.  This version gives Lord of the Rings junkies more of a fix, and at just over four hours, it's a heck of a fix.

The new scenes are all great and well done.  The confrontation with Saruman, though not totally faithful to the book, still embodies the spirit of the all the characters involved save Frodo and Sam who were present at his demise in the book.  Peter Jackson's love of gore has a slight influence in his death, something you'll have to see.  The additional scenes in the house of healing added depth to Eowyn, making use of an underused character and actress in my opinion.  Faramir and Denethor have more scenes including one with Sean Bean which shows the depths of Denethor's madness as well as the heartfelt tragedy of his late remembrance of his love for his other son, Faramir.  Merry and Pippin get a few more lines to deliver in true Hobbit fashion, but also we get to see more of their heroic deeds that earn them so much respect from the rest of Middle Earth.  Gandalf's confrontation with the Witch King is good, though it seems to start a bit forced compared to the other scene additions.  Still, it's a good scene.  Theoden, another character that was underused, benefits some from the additions as does Eomer.  Aragorn probably has the most new scenes, including an addition to the confrontation with the King of the Dead and the attack on the Corsairs.  He also gets a scene with the Palantir and confronts Sauron directly.  The scene at the Black Gate with the Mouth of Sauron is great, and how it ends probably would've have audiences cheering had it been included in the theatrical release.  Finally, Sam and Frodo and Smeagol get a few new additions, though not many since most of the story was focused on them anyway.  The escaping the troop of marching Orcs was added, which provides a slight moment of comic relief to a very demanding ending to the movie.

In addition to adding new scenes, the movie has many scenes that are extended.  The Ride of the Rohirrim during the battle of the Pelanor fields is extended slightly to show even more footage of this amazing scene, probably one of the best horse charges ever filmed.  The battle scenes aren't the only ones that get extra footage and they are numerous and spread out through the film.  No changes were made to the ending of the film, which I have to admit, I would've liked to see them add the extra bits about what happened to rest of the fellowship.  The Scouring of the Shire is also missing, which I find a blessing considering after three and a half hours of intense drama and action, more would just be too much.

Many note the great battle scenes or the amazing special effects as the greatest achievement to these movies.  But their true greatness lies in their ability to capture the true spirit of the story.  They may not follow the book perfectly, but there's no mistaking that the message they pass along is contained within the pages of the book.  The acting is superb in all of the scenes.  The visual quality was improved from the theatrical DVD release (notice how the blacks actually look black instead of dark gray?) and the audio options increase.  The documentaries are great though the best one is probably the one focusing on the Rohirrim.  It shows the filming with the horses, which to Tolkien were very much characters in the book, and a very humorous look at the fake horse (a 40 gal barrel) used for close ups of the actors.

Overall a must have for Lord of the Rings fans.  Casual fans of the trilogy will be fine with the original version, but there is no way anyone who likes these movies can go without seeing this version.  A true classic of our time.",1103587200,11,3927,4.534090909090909

If you are one of the few who couldn't stand to sit through the theatrical cut for its length, this is not for you. If how long a movie runs isn't that important, read on. As the extra scenes have already been pointed out and dissected by many others, let me just say that many scenes really weren't that vital to the story, but helped it tremendously. The scene at Isengard with Saruman and Wormtongue alone is worth getting this set for. The new and enhanced scenes add depth and development to several charactors, and help explain a few scenes from the theatrical cut that didn't make too much sense at the time. As for leaving some things out or unfilmed, (the scouring of the shire, for example)this is Peter Jackson's adaptation, and his call to edit or film as he wished. I believe he did a top-notch job with extremely difficult source material, and was richly deserving of the accolades that came his way as a result. The film was deeply moving, dark, and terrifying. Happy in completion of the quest, melancholy at the cost of victory. To me, a favorite scene is near the end, with the four hobbits back home, at the inn. Sharing mugs of beer, looking at all the gaiety about them, unable to join it, due to the fact they themselves are forever changed. When viewed in sequence with the other extended cut films in the trilogy, The Return of the King is extremely emotional, thrilling, and heart rending.

7274420,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"first off, this is a great dsc, but....

I liked the EE of FOTR and TTT much better than the theatrical editions. The other EE's were made in away that improved pacing and filled out the story. ROTK just dosent have that quality as much. It feels forced in places, and some new scenes just don't do much for the story and/or are just in for comic relief- blowing out the ghost hands like candles after they appear to be pulling legolas down to the ground? come on! It also comes off as just too long- and I love long movies! The other EEs did not come off as longer, just better. That is lacking here. Some of the new scenes interefere with the pacing, such as the new battle scenes, i liked the theatrical version better.

that said- there are some major improvments:

voice of saruman scene was a great improvment. true, he didn't die in that manner in the books, but with the scouring of the shire scenes not in the movie, saruman didn't need to survive till the end, and that was a good way to close his a wormtongue's story.

the added dialoge at the paths of the dead and the taking of the corsair ships were  great additions,

as was the mouth of sauron. CREEPY!! some people have said it was unneeded b/c we the viewers knew frodo was still alive, but its not about the viewer- its about adding doubt to the minds of aragon and friends and the effect the mouth's claims have on them. they don't know he is alive. This is a attempt by suaron to fill them with doubt and despair, and our knowledege that frodo is alive is irrelevant.

one final gripe- eowyn goes from talking to theoden just before he dies and looking pretty much fine (all things considered)  to half dead on the ground when found by eomer. Way to much of a jump, I thought i'd missed something. If you are not well versed on the books this is confusing, as the scene presupposes that that the knows that she eventually goes to the houses of healing.

overall I'd reccomend ROTK EE, it's just not as good as the other EE s, but still agreat way to kill 4 hours.",1103500800,4,2035,4.278645833333333

7274422,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"a few spoilers so beware if you haven't seen it yet. Also, beware of serious geekness committed by yours truly...

I saw the ROTK EE with a couple buddies last Friday. 50 minutes of extra footage. Unlike the first two movies most of the extra footage here were in very small almost not noticeable increments.

There were a couple larger scenes. The most prominent was the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf and company. This was pretty good. They basically threw in what happened at the Scouring at this scene.  I was glad to see the plot with Saruman get finished but I didn't like the way they ended it.

Added in also was footage of Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas in the Halls of the Dead. Instead of the scene ending with Aragorn asking the allegiance of the Undead, it continues on with the Undead initially rejecting Aragorns plea and then accepting it about 3 minutes later after Peter Jackson pulls out an Indiana Jones type scene.

Other tidbits were just more humor scenes. Totally not needed and I think it kinda butchers the story. Any fan who has read the books know the seriousness of what was happening. Trial came first, joy came at the end.

Really, only a couple of the scenes added in were faithful to the books....the love between Faramir and Eowyn, the troubled relationship between Faramir and Denethor and then Aragorn confronting Sauron with the Palantir.

The Mouth of Sauron was ok too but even that bugged me because after Aragorn kills the Mouth and the new footage goes back to the original footage, you no longer see the body of the Mouth. BAD EDITING!

Oh, and the standoff between the Witch King and Gandalf was horrendous. They didn't even make it somewhat of a battle. You telling me that one of the great Maia (Gandalf) couldn't stand for more than a couple seconds against one of Saurons spawn when in ""The Hobbit"" Gandalf was able to stand against Sauron himself? Please...

All in all....I am pretty disappointed. I think this movie was the best of the trilogy but I prefer the other two extended editions. I will still end up buying it just because I have the first two and I want to complete the collection. But if I watch ROTK again it will probably be the theatrical release.",1103500800,23,2220,4.614213197969543

7274424,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"As almost everyone knows, TROK is the best of the three movies. Gut-wrenching and suspenseful, even if you have read the books, it takes the viewer on a trip beyond imagination. It is a classic book filmed almost perfectly by Peter Jackson and company.

The extended version does have some issues though. A lot of the new and extended scenes on disk 1 seem to for the first time have a ""filler"" feel to them. The ""Voice of Saruman"" scene is the first of the new scenes and is needed. Although it is not accurate to the books version of the end of Saruman (there is NO way the correct way could have been done without adding another 30 to 45 minutes to the end of the film) it is adequate. The absense of Saruman in the theatrical release version was always a problem to me. But other new scenes, like ""Eowyn's Dream"" really do not seem to have the purpose of expanding the story. Another new scene, ""Sam's Warning"" where Sam threatens Gollum (for probably the 5th time) just supports the already known fact that Sam does not trust Gollum. But the expanded scene, ""The Paths of the Dead"" was a wonderful addition, well worth the watch.

Disk 2 made up for any issue I had with disk 1. The first scene is brand new and shows how Aragorn captures the Corsair's ships. ""Merry's Simple Courage"" is a nice, touching new scene. And the MUCH expanded battle scenes of ""The Battle of the Pelennor Fields"" & ""Victory at Minas Tirith"" are absolutely brilliant.

One of the best part of this version is the expanded roles of Merry & Pippen. In the books both characters were heros in their own right. In the theatrical version you only se a little of that. In the Extended releases you get to see many more heroic deeds from these two.

The Lords of the Rings series has been a joy to watch for the past three years. As the books were favorites of mine since I first read them back in the 70's I had been worried about how this would play out on the screen. I shouldn't have been. Consider these masterpieces, well worth the time investment.

All the added and extended scenes were very good, but when it came right down to it, Jackson failed to include The Scouring of the Shire. Of all of the scenes that should have been added, this was it. It is important to know that the Shire had changed, and the returning hobbits had to correct the changes that occured. From my point of view, this single exclusion ruined this cut. It was the one scene that I looked forward to seeing the most, but it was not there. Despite thsi disappointment, you should not turn your back on this edition, because it is very good, I'm just really picky. Picky enough where I could write a fifty page paper to Peter Jackson on how he screwed up, but that is another tale. Definetely buy this, it's worth every penny.",1103414400,2,932,4.271186440677966

I loved most of the additions added back into the EE, but some of them left me wanting different things.  I would've rather have seen what happened to Legolas and Gimli after the Ring was destroyed rather than see the two in a drinking game.

I'm sure every fan has a list of things they wish would've been included in the films that wasn't.  I know I do.  However, I still think the movie is an excellent addition to the trilogy, and I'm looking forward to when I have the time to have a marathon.

The extras are top notch!  The care that the cast and crew had with these movies is evident as you watch the hours of additional material.  Some of the information isn't brand new, but there is a lot of great stuff.  One thing that I found particularly moving were the last days of the cast members and the documentary about the young man with cancer.

As a sucker for commentary, I loved PJ, Fran, and Phillipa's track.  They're all very funny...I especially enjoyed with PJ shooshes Fran about a ""crack of doom"" comment.  Also, the cast commentary is enjoyable as well.  I could listen to just a Billy Boyd/Dominac Mognahan track and be content.  Sean Astin and Elijah Wood are a little sickening sweet though.

7274429,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"Unfortunately--and despite all the hype, before and after the movie's release--the theatrical release of ""Return of the King"" is the weakest of Peter Jackson's three ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. As beautiful as the pictures are, as obviously dedicated as the films' crew was to making a great film, ""ROTK"" is a jagged, uneven effort that would have greatly benefited from an extra six months to a year of post-production and reflection.

""ROTK"" suffers terribly from sloppy editing and screenwriting. The script has to carry an uneccessary load of narrative invented by Jackson and his scriptwriters, slowing down the first half of the movie and leading to the slapdash construction of the second half. You can quote me box office and Oscar wins all day long, but Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens blunder badly every time they step away from Tolkien's plot and into their own ill-conceived storylines. It's a telling point that ""ROTK"" is at its best when adhering to the original story, and at its ponderous, eye-rolling worst when Walsh and Boyens' freshman-year-screenwriting-course rules are invoked.

Jackson's decision to cut out ""the Scouring of the Shire,"" while possibly a narrative neccessity due to the extreme length of the film, fatally dilutes the impact of the last half hour. The oft-criticized five endings would have had a real punch if we'd been able to see the hobbits' shock and pain at the sight of their own homeland laid to waste. Pity that Jackson chose to jettison this critical final segment of Tolkien's plot; without it, Jackson's ending is simply repetitive and dull.

Look, this isn't a terrible movie. There are some genuinely exiting and moving sections, notably the first half of the Battle of the Pellenor Fields, and any scene featuring Gandalf or Andy Serkis' marvelous Gollum. Unfortunately, the spectacular eye-candy and some nice performances from Ian McKellan, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are often overshadowed by the gross overacting of Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, and a generally weak effort from Viggo Mortensen in the title role.

Pity. There's so much good here. The ""look"" is just right, and the resources were in place to do things the right way. Sadly, in the end, Jackson and company should have taken more time to edit the film (why lock yourself in to the one-a-year cycle, once the first movie was a huge hit?) and trusted Tolkien, rather than themselves, to tell the story properly.

NOTE:  The just-released extended DVD version is a considerable improvement, particularly in the pacing of the second half of the film.  This in no way excuses Jackson's dumb script decisions in this and the other two movies--which were both also much improved in their DVD incarnations.",1103414400,3,2735,5.037610619469026

Of all three films (all of which I would rate 5 star), ""Return of the King"" is the one most enhanced by the extended and extra scenes. The overall flow of the story is improved, rather than hampered, and the details added can't help but delight almost all Tolkien fans everywhere.

I could go on and on about each scene, but I would hate to spoil anything, especially if anyone was disappointed by specific scenes not included in the theatrical release. No, not everything is there, but the extra features are absolutely a treat.

Aside from the continuing high quality of the production, the two DVDs of documentary included continue the story of the making of the films and bring them to a very heartfelt conclusion. There is enough here to make any viewer feel as if they were right there as the films were being made.

Time after time, the cast and crew show what love and craft went into this production. Though not all Tolkien fans will agree with the decisions made by Peter Jackson, an examination of the documentaries at least explains why the decisions were made. Personally, I agree with almost everything Jackson did.

Not to be missed is the biography of Cameron Duncan, who was the inspiration for the song ""Into the West"", featured at the end of the film.

The extended release transforms ""Return of the King"" from merely an excellent film to an absolutely mind blowing experience.

7274432,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"The first thing I can say about this extended edition of Return of the King, is that it fits more easily with TTT extended edition. The scenes with Saruman and the more detailed look into the fates of Theoden and Eowyn complete their stories more fully.

In fact Eowyn becomes an even stronger character here.

The scene where Eomer finds her lifeless body is chilling and heartbreaking. I just wish they had followed the book more closely and allowed Theoden an honorable burial.

I welcome the lengthier dialogue, which reads more like Tolkien.  Saruman's speech reveals his reasoning for

attacking the world of men. He's arrogant and feels his knowledge gives him power over their fate.

On the other hand,  the extended cut feels too long and many of the newly included scenes seem gratuitous. Do we need to know that Pippin's armor once belonged to Faramir? Jackson seems to be explaining many things we took for granted in the film version. Like the army of the dead. You know they agreed to Aragorns offer, when they all show up at Pellenor Field.  Showing their ghostly attack earlier in the film dilutes that great shot of Aragorn leaping from the black ship, thousands of ghostly green soldier following his lead. It's hard to feel anything when the Mouth of Sauron shows up with bad news about Frodo. We already know he is alive.

And to you who think negative reviewers are ""picky"" about missing ""details"" from the book then first let me say that ignoring ""the ending itself""(!) on such a mighty book - that's the main proof of that you probably haven't opened Tolkiens' work - and that Jackson has missed a big point! The fate and will of Saruman.

Haven't you ever read a book you almost couldn't get enough of, then rented the movie - and got disappointed? Why should this movie be so different? People have a right to have expectations, and certainly so when the cast, producers - the theme of the movie itself - claims it to be put to life in the spirit of this great author. This is the spirit of America and Hollywood, and I wonder if the Australian director here has lived a bit too long over there - I wonder if a worthy filming of the book requires an english director with the same resources as Mr. Jackson were given.

I trusted the extended version to be more detailed, or at least faithful to Tolkien - it's not. It opens with the ""The voice of Saruman"" (And what was it that was so special about his voice, Mr. Jackson??) - my first reaction was ""Not this too!""

Not many of the 48 minutes informs the essential of the story, but the movie managed to do some things right as Frodo and Sam enters Mordor there at the end, a few minutes here were actually rather good. But why these many unaccurate, unnecessary changes? This becomes irritating when you know what really happened in the ""real"" story, it's as simple as that.

""The Mouth of Sauron"" scene is magnificient as well.  Those two new clips greatly enhanced the film but the taking over of the corsair ships is another essential addition (although Boyens and Jackson in their commentary disagreed).  As for the documentaries, the first one with the LOTR scholars was exceptional but, by now, I'm rather bored all of the multivarient production features.

7274436,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I admit that I've been a GREAT fan of the Tolkien trilogy since I first read them (in the 1960's), and that I love director Peter Jackson's visionary interpretation, but I'm not going to attempt to analyze the longer (and superior) version of ""The Return of the King"", here...what truly makes the Extended Edition absolutely ESSENTIAL for ANY film fan are the 2 discs of additional features!

If you really love filmmaking, in all of it's many aspects, you will NEVER find a more comprehensive 'primer' of the creation of a film classic! Beginning with the WWI experiences of J.R.R. Tolkien, which, combined with his love of the heroic prose epics of Great Britain and Scandinavia, and an amazing talent to create languages, led to his writing what he considered an ""unfilmable"" classic trilogy, the viewer is taken on a journey as magical and fascinating as the final chapter, itself.

Jumping from Tolkien's source material to Peter Jackson's daunting task of not only completing the trilogy, but making the final part the greatest of the three films, we visit each area of production, with step-by-step documentary 'chapters' of how the finished film was achieved. While a 'nuts and bolts' technical overview has been done as an 'additional feature' for many DVDs, I've never seen a version more comprehensive and entertaining, because Jackson produced it, himself, and set the chapters into a timeline (from pre-production to premiere), that captures the tension and excitement of a film so large in scope and production that the final FX shots and music were not inserted until less than a week before ""Return"" premiered, world-wide!

Fascinating stories and secrets are shared, by cast and crew...You finally meet one of the 'little people' who played a Hobbit for the long shots of the trilogy; Christopher Lee's controversial 'disappearance' from the final theatrical cut is explained; you get to see 'unused' subplots that were actually filmed (including a thankfully discarded sword battle finale between Aragorn and Sauron); in a very funny sequence, you see Jackson and many production heads, in full make-up, doing 'cameos' as Corsair pirates during a battle!

There is much, much, more, and every chapter, from FX to Costume, from Sound Design to Music, are each given loving attention, and are all terrific, and great fun.

As a climax, viewers are treated to the premieres in Wellington, and around the world, and get front-row seats for both the Oscars and the post-Oscar party...then get to see Jackson return to the studio to add even MORE footage to the 'Best Picture' winner, for this extended edition!

See why I consider this version ESSENTIAL? To my knowledge, there has never been so much fabulous material offered in ANY 'Special Edition' DVD!

This IS a 'MUST' for ANY film fan's collection!",1103414400,8,2818,5.060344827586207
7274437,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"well, it seems that you who read the ending of LOTR as an allegory didn't pay much attention to J.R.R. Tolkien's own introduction in which he denounces his work as an allegory. Such nitpicking on a remarkable achievement in film, storytelling, set design and ensemble acting is in my mind unfair and elitist. No film-to-book adapation is ever perfect, and people need to get used to that fact. Peter Jackson accomplished something insurmountable with grace, style, and flair...that achievment should not be ignored or cheapened by pseudo-intellectual hogwash.",1103328000,8,559,5.363636363636363
7274438,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition Collector's Gift Set) is a must have for all LOTR fans.

This edition has well over 50-minutes of extended scenes that are worth watching.  I really enjoy the highly-detailed bust of Minas Tirith that came with the box because it is well-designed and very detailed.  I think the Minas Tirith bust goes well with the two Argonath that came with The Fellowship of the Ring Platinum Edition.  Another of my favorites from the collection is the Howard Shore Symphony DVD exclusive that shows the music performed live in a symphony.  Yet another good addition to my LOTR soundtrack collection.

Extended scenes that I like are the last confrontation with Saruman and more story-telling of Faramir and Denethor.  The battle sequence is somewhat longer because more uncut scenes were added, and they really enhance the battle at Pelenor Fields.  I love it.

Those who complained about the movie does not know what Hollywood and Movie-making is all about.  Peter Jackson did an outstanding job at directing the movie in every aspect.  He did many alterations to the scene and events from the book, but it was appropriate for the flow of the movie.  I believe Peter did a wonderful job at keeping up with Tolkein's work.

I myself have read Tolkein's LOTR trilogy, and I have to agree that it surpasses Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy by far.  Still, I believe movies are just movies and must take in consideration that the purpose of movies is for entertainment.",1103328000,,1540,4.82824427480916
7274439,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"So much of what is good with this movie, and what some felt was wrong with it, has already been said. I won't comment much on that. I know that some people were outraged we didn't have the scourging of the Shire, which is in the novel. I missed it too, but have to say, it would have been such a ""let down"" theatrically. Imagine, we have just had our guts wrenched out of us, nearly fearing the loss of all hope as Frodo puts on the ring, and finally the battle is won, evil has been vanquished. Even in the book, after all the heavy stuff of war before it, the scourging of the Shire seemed, well, just too much of a ""good thing"" when all the real battle was over, and the threat to middle-earth destroyed. We know that Saruman had no power anymore, and he would be defeated. The fact he went and enslaved some Hobbits to appease his ego was completely out of place, and it made the very long summing up of a great story too long. Destroying Saruman as he was destroyed and where he was destroyed made perfect theatrical sense. His power was over, his threat destroyed. That last little bit in the Shire, as in the book, would not have changed a thing in regards to him. However, it would have made a huge difference in regards to the movie. Like I said, we have been wrenched in two, emotionally, as the various characters face their nearly overwhelming battles that are at times almost hopeless and unwinnable. We have seen Frodo fail, really, and be overcome by the power of the ring (it is really Gollum's greed for ""the Precious"" that finally destroys the ring, Frodo has given in and if Gollum had not bitten off his finger and fallen over the edge and died with the ring, Sauran would have won, and middle earth would have been destroyed). And finally, because of all things combined, we see the destruction of evil and victory for middle earth. The real important battle, the cause of the entire story to begin with has actually ended. The rest of the movie and the book is a summing up of things. I was actually disappointed when I read the book as a kid to see we had another battle to win to free the Shire; wasn't evil conquered once and for all, and now we have two caricatures holding on to their evil with no power whatever to sustain them tormenting the shire and we have to overpower them all over again. The events pass quickly in the book and are forgotten. However, the destruction of Frodo as a person, a person unlike Sam who is able to reintegrate himself into his former world, is most telling and sad. Here we see a man who after all he finally overcame, even when in the end it was almost impossible for him to overcome what he did, couldn't find the strength within to face life and go on. The movie portrays that somewhat (though by no means as it is portrayed in the book; in the book, the Hobbits in the Shire sing the praises of Sam and the others as true heros, while to them Frodo becomes too distant, too depressing to be understood, and even though he had the greatest of the great deeds to accomplish, the hardest of all tests and challenges to overcome, no one seems to even see much importance in him at all; also, he cannot relate to his former life, his former hobbit values, you could say, he has been forever changed, and life as it was can never be his again -- a common result of war for many soldiers). We have seen Frodo changing throughout the entire trilogy and the ring possessing him. It really wins, after all, even if it is destroyed, for the damage it does, the evil with which it infects all those who possess it also infected Frodo, and he is never freed from that. To me, it was far more important to express these feelings, for we saw them before our eyes, and resolve them, than to once again have us see another battle (and in the extended version, we are witness to many, many battles, an additional one would not enhance our experience much). As we see, as in the book, the only resolution for Frodo is to leave middle earth and the Shire. He leaves with Bilbo and with all those who are not of men. Sam returns, though very sad, to the Shire and to his new and wonderfully fulfilling life. The quest didn't destroy him, even if his brief moment carrying the ring had its affects. Frodo, on the other hand was changed completely.

The wonderful thing about the books is they reflect on so many different issues while telling a very long involved and moving story. It is more than a kid's ""war-time fairytale"" even if the author considered it nothing more than a child's book. The Hobbit is such a work, Lord of the Rings is not. Through the entire movie series, Jackson has thrown us deep into the horrors, the fears, the despair, and the triumphs of the characters. Once we have sighed with them the sighs of relief for all is now safe and the evil is destroyed, to force us to endure another battle (and one as unthreatening as the scourging of the Shire really is) would destroy the feelings and the emotional release we so deeply need.

So many have commented on the fact that the ending after the end of the wars seemed just ""slow"" and unnecessary. If that is what you feel, then I can guarantee you after watching the incredible victory that is achieved, to see the Scourging of the Shire would have been even more of a let down, for it would make no sense at all; why another battle when the war was won.

There are many parts of the movie that are not faithful to the details of the book, but the feel of the book is well represented. Some have complained that it would have been impossible for the Witch King to destroy Gandolf's staff, and in the explanations they give that is quite true, but it is there to let us know just how powerful the evil has become. It is not Gandolf's staff that is the source of his power anyway, and besides, from that point on (even in the book) we see no evidence of his great ""wizardry"" anyway. However, it is so necessary that we the viewer understand just how powerful Sauran has become. His evil has invaded the entire world, and excepting a few who battle against him, most all the world is rushing to his support. The scene could have been done better, that is true, and there could have been more clarity in explaining what was happening, but in the end, we get the message: evil is stronger now than ever, and the battle against it will be impossible to win if Frodo should fail, not even the power of the most powerful wizard of all could save middle-earth. It was important that this message, and the feelings of hopeless despair it would bring be set in our minds so that we are in despair as we watch the battle that would come and fear, as our lead characters fear, wondering if Frodo will be successful (and there are moments that it is most powerfully presented in the movie that one can tell the characters actually get a sense all is lost, the battle is over and middle earth will be no more; then we notice the eye change its focus, and all switches raising our expectations and our hopes).

I agree that the house of healing was not well represented, and the reason the various characters were there is not made clear. However, the fact we even have what we have in such a long movie is wonderful. At least we now know how various people meet, and that Arogorn is not only a wonderful Ranger, Friend, part of the Fellowship, but a real King who is there for the serving of his people. Even getting that tiny bit is well worth it.

Overall, I loved this movie, as I have done all the extended versions (I never watch the theatrical releases anymore, as once I saw the extended versions I simply didn't enjoy them). I think this is an unbelievable movie accomplishment, one that we are not likely to see again in the future or for a very long time. And as for a movie version of the Hobbit, well, why bother. So many things in the Hobbit (which is where the story of the ring and the hobbits begins) are changed so drastically by the time of Lord of the Rings, the contradictions would leave us wanting or disappointed. Should anyone want another Tolken book to make a movie of, the Simarillion would be a far better choice.

I recommend this movie to everyone. It is long, but very satisfying. It is a super ending to a most difficult and ""impossible to adapt"" book, and I am sure the best we will ever have, for as it stands, it is the best version that has ever been presented ever.",1103328000,6,8406,4.340750158931977

(not in any particular order...)

1)  Beginning scene with Saruman- good addition, but unfortunately marred by the very fake looking fireball.

2)  I liked the extra scene of Gothmog's death- he was a bit too important of a character to have dismissed his death so lightly.

3) Eomer's bawling scene with Eowyn- fantastic!

4) A few more shots of Gamling, but I don't think we ever find out how he dies? if he even does.

5) The much hyped House of Healing is too hyped; there's not enough of an interaction between Faramir and Eowyn to justify their strong love for each other in my opinion.

6) The secret hidden cameo of Peter Jackson as a pirate getting killed by Legolas' errant arrow is farkin' hilarious.  Abosolutely a hoot!

7) Aragorn's killing of the Mouth of Sauron did seem a bit strange- uh, weren't they discussing under a truce flag?  Just a bit of movie trivia here, but the Mouth was played by Bruce Hopkins, the same actor who played the Trainman in the Matrix:Revolutions.  Interesting, both characters had bad teeth...

8) Was the witch king really more powerful than Gandalf the WHITE?

9) Enjoyed the additional combat footage; e.g. the orcs initially faily to break through the gates of Minas Tirith, and needing to bring up Grond.  Also liked the sweeping wide shots of the siege towers attacking the walls.  And, the orcs' attacking Osgiliath is clarified a bit more as well.

7274444,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"I was extremely excited about this release for well over a year.

I thoroughly enjoyed the theatrical release, loose threads and all.  I was glad to see those threads tied together and fleshed out in the extended versions.

However, for the ROTK extended edition, the addition of most of the new material is extraneous and in some ways damaging to the flow of the film.  (Fran Walsh eludes to as much in the commentary).

A few examples:

The addition of the ""house of healing"" storyline is far too minimal.  It's certainly a nod to us who enjoyed the books, but does not work in context of the film as it is presented.

The blooming tree in Gondor lessens the dramatic tension in the film and fore-shadows, too soon, the outcome of the siege.

Eowyn, gets an extra scene with Merry, which while interesting, leaves one wondering why someone failed to mention to the king that his niece was riding with them disguised as a man.  This gaffe weakens her scenes later on, especially when she is ""discovered"" laying injured on the battle field.

It is extra material like this, while enjoyable to watch, that left me feeling like I wish I could create my own edit of the film.

Some of it was great and sorely missed, most left me thinking that they went too far.  Good but not as great as the previous 2 extended films.",1103241600,17,1316,4.5021097046413505

I've been very pleased with all the extended editions thus far, but this one just made Return of the King my indisputable favorite of the series. As much as I enjoyed the theatrical version, I felt that after the battle of the Pelennor Fields the movie lost its pace and rushed through the final sequences just to cover the remaining bulk of the story. (Similar to how the theatrical version of Fellowship felt after losing Gandalf in the mines of Moria.) Fret not! All has been remedied.

Enough has been said about the inclusion of Saruman's demise and I agree with the sentiments that it really sets up the emotions of the film. I understand the reasons for why it was not included, but still it was a pity that it did not make the original cut. Great stuff.

However, hat's off to this new final act. An extended Cirith Ungol sequence, Aragorn's confrontation with Sauron in the Palantir, Frodo and Sam getting caught up in the orc army and last but certainly not least- the encounter with the Mouth of Sauron (talk about creepy!!) add much needed tension and drama. The growth of Aragorn from ranger to king was also far more palpable and satisfying as his additional scenes provide more depth and insight into his character.

Alas, there certainly are some scenes that were very loosely adapted from Tolkien's original text and may get a few people in an uproar, but I resigned myself to those kinds of changes ever since the day Aragorn went over that cliff. I've come to realize that these films are a labour of love and are the only movie adaptation of its kind that I will likely ever get to see in my lifetime.

I love the scenes added that are closer to the book such as the houses of healing and the prose from Legolas before the paths of the dead which closely mirror Tolkein's writing.  But I have to say some of the new scenes are cringe-worthy, mainly having to do with Gimli.  I just loved Gimli in the books, his person was one of bravery and honor, and much pride.  I am so upset that Jackson has relegated him to almost constant silly comic relief.  Jackson assumes that his audience can't handle the dread, despair, and fear that Tolkien instilled in his fellowship in the books.  Yes they still had hope, but they struggled with fear and doubt knowing what awaited them. SPOILERS AHEAD!!

  In the books as Gimli went into the paths of the dead he was struck with such fear (and of course it was total darkness in the cave, I understand this would not relate to film) that he was crawling on his hands and knees in absolute terror, yet he wen't in because in the end he was honorable and brave and a true friend of the fellowship.  This scene in the books was so terrifying, yet in the film Jackson mainly makes it a comedy.  Gimli blowing at the spirits as if they are candles is such a lame way to film this scene.  His tap dance on the skulls is ridiculous. The drinking game was another scene where I was sitting there saying ""you have to be kidding me, this is not lord of the rings.  Gimli passes gas, goes cross-eyed and falls out of his bench backwards as his feet sprawl in the air----what?  This is not the Gimli I know. I can handle a few off key laughs as much as the next person, I just can't stand this slapstick routine that insults our intelligence(not to mention poor Gimli's mangled character in these films).

  I wish I could delete the forced comedy in these movies myself.  Jackson still did a great job with the trilogy, because the scenes that are good (most of them) are so very very good as to cover a multitude of ones that are not.  And did you notice that the most beautiful scenes and the most beautiful dialog are straight from Tolkien's book.  Peter Jackson is great with action and emotion, but the comedy schtick has got to go.  Like I said I can understand some comedy and laughs in a time of peril if it is used in context of the characters trying to alleviate their fears, but some of these scenes are just too silly and take you out of the moments that Tolkien implied for you to feel.

Even still four stars because the strong points of these films are very strong.  I love these films, but I love more what they could have been had they not strayed from the formula laid down by Tolkien.",1103241600,4,2732,4.272373540856031

High points:

Low point: Gimli farts.

I'm writing this review mainly to address a point discussed in someone else's review.  I haven't listened to the commentary yet, so maybe this gets discussed there, but here goes.

It's extremely clear from the book that the reason Merry's sword harmed the Witch-King was because it was a blade forged by the Dunedain specifically to fight the Witch-King in Angmar.  Since FOTR skips the incident with the Barrow-wights, the hobbits don't get these weapons.  Instead Merry and Pippin get ""elven daggers"".  I don't think these two weapon types are in any way equivalent.

But here's my big question ( and I'm sure this has all been hashed out already in some forum ):

Shouldn't we assume, when Merry and Pippin are captured by the orcs in Parth Galen, that their weapons are taken from them? Why would Merry in ROTK still have any weapon obtained in FOTR?

In fact I really don't know how Tolkien would explain this.

Here's me rationalizing: maybe the swords were recovered by Aragorn & Co. after the orc party was killed, and returned to the hobbits at Isengard?

In any event it seems that Merry's sword in the FILM version of ROTK is given to him by the Rohirrim, and is probably not magical or special in any way.  So why should it have harmed the Witch-King?

7274458,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"For anyone that read the trilogy, we know what was missing. In Return of the King the major glaring anomolies were the halls of healing and the scouring of the shire, marking the death of Sauraman.  All I can say, is Peter Jackson fulfills my needs in this extended version.  While not the same as the book these key scenes are handled very well.  The extended edition is like watching an entirely new movie than the theatrical version.  I am very, very satisfied at the outcome of this trilogy, not many other directors can get such praise.",1103155200,3,541,4.546391752577319
7274459,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The Extended Version of The Return of the King, like the Extended Versions of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, is far superior to the theatrical release.  Much of what was trimmed out to make the movie an acceptable length for theaters was not, strictly speaking, necessary to the story line, but having it included in this version makes Jackson's masterpiece a close (but still only close) approximation of J.R.R. Tolkien's own vision.

Early in the Extended Version comes the first thrill, the restoration of the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf at Orthanc.  What in the theatrical version seemed brief to the point of irrelevance is now restored.  Saruman gives a chilling warning to the Wizard, Elf, Dwarf, Hobbits and Men who have brought about his defeat that their triumph will not last long, thus setting an appropriate tone for the tension which will pervade this film.

Most of the rest of the additional material merely fills in some blank spots here and there and adds additional depth to the characters.  I am particularly fond of a conversation between Eowyn and Merry on the nature of friendship, courage, and honor.  There are also some beautiful scenes of the Houses of Healing, where Eowyn and Faramir meet and fall in love.  The additional material shot on the Paths of the Dead and in the Tower of Cirith Ungol also flesh out the story and resolve some questions. (And give Peter Jackson a chance for a cameo.) I was also glad to see the King recrowned at the Crossroads. Most of all, I am happy that the Mouth of Sauron finally made it into the film.  He ought to win an award, perhaps for Most Sarcastic Villain or possibly for Nastiest Looking Teeth!

Fans of the movie who have watched every teaser and every preview shot for four or five years now will be pleased to see some old favorites finally made it into the film in this version:  Gandalf and the Witch-king, Aragorn's vision of a dying Arwen, Eomer sobbing over Eowyn on the battlefield, and Merry offering his sword to Theoden.

The new material ends after the Mount Doom/Black Gate sequences, which makes for a certain amount of disappointment.  I would have liked to have seen the White Tree in full bloom rather than just its blossoms flying in the wind at the Coronation (although we do get to see one bloom on the tree earlier in the film).  I would also have enjoyed seeing the Bearers of the Three Rings more clearly identified, so that those who have not read the books will understand who they are and why they are leaving Middle earth.  But even in an Extended Edition everything cannot be included, and this version has far more of Tolkien's words and spirit than the theatrical release.  This 35 year Tolkien fan (since the age of 12)can find much to admire and some things to love, with comparatively little to regret, in this Lord of the Rings as envisioned by Peter Jackson.

The additional material in the third and fourth DVDs deal with the process of filming the movies. There is a huge amount of information here which will take me many weeks, if not months, to absorb.  I have seen and already enjoyed a Middle earth Atlas and a short segment identifying regions in New Zealand which were used for filming.  Its also interesting to see some discarded concepts, like the storyboards detailing a final battle in which Sauron himself was supposed to fight Aragorn.  And the polystone sculpture of Minas Tirith will be a worthy companion for The Fellowship's Argonath bookends and The Two Towers' Gollum statuette.  The White Tower rises to a sharp point that could almost be used as a bill spike, and don't overlook the hidden compartment in the base with the nice depiction of the White Tree. Finally, there is an extra DVD covering Howard Shore's score, with excerpts from concert productions of The Lord of the Rings symphony.  This extra material complements the movie and adds an extra touch of delight to what is already a happy creation.",1103155200,4,3968,4.712011577424023
7274460,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I was one of the early critics of ROTK because the film seemed disjointed in the theater-although I still generally liked the movie then.  However after watching the extended editon everything makes so much more sense.  I mean some serious scenes were cut out of the theatrical production-my new personal favorite of the new scenes takes place initially at the gates of mordor when Aragorn, and company ride up to call out Sauron.

If you do buy this DVD, and you should, be prepared to spend about 5hrs with this one(including a couple of short breaks).  Very very long, but well worth it because it got almost everything from the original Tolkien novel here.  This film is a winner on so many levels for the breadth of detail Peter Jackson incorporates into this film.

If $30 is not an issue, definitely trade-up to this one-even if you own the original version of ROTK-you won't regret it.",1103155200,5,893,4.6923076923076925
7274461,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I remember how much I laughed at the awful quality of the animated renderings of the novels done in the 1970s and the early 1980s. The animations were outright ludicrous and the hobbit characters looked almost like a cross between humans and oranges or grapefruits plus the wizards Gandalf and Saruman both looked like bad Santa Claus cartoon outtakes.

It's 180 degrees different on the Peter Jackson renditions of the movies. The theatrical edition of ""Return of The King"" is the apex of the most glorious cinematic era in modern history. The movie which concluded the epic Lord Of The Rings saga that spanned three films and nine hours long total made me cry like no other movie in my life. Not even ""Titanic"" made me shed tears at the end like ROTK did and ""Return of The King"" is arguably the greatest movie of the 21st century and all three films are absolutely timeless. Peter Jackson has without a doubt created the greatest movie saga of all time and successfully adapted what was the previously labeled `inadaptable' novel of J. R. R. Tolkien's ""Lord of The Rings"" novel trilogy. While I've only read parts of each book from the ""Fellowship"", to the ""Two Towers"", and finally the ""Return of The King"", I am absolutely stunned at how Peter Jackson who I previously never heard of before actually did it. As I watched all three movies together, I would say that Tolkien is smiling from heaven wherever he is. Please note though that this review may contain some spoilers so beware.

Picking right up where the middle part ""The Two Towers"" left off, Frodo Baggins along with his lifelong friend and acquaintance Samwise Gamgee are moving ever closer to Mordor with the help of Gollum. The evil power of the Ring is taking even stronger hold on Frodo as he approaches the slopes of Mt. Doom in order to cast the Ring back to the place where it was forged to destroy it and Sauron forever. Meanwhile the kingdom of Gondor and it's capital of Minas Tirith once a great civilization has been falling into ruin and is falling even further into a desperate state under the leadership of the Steward Denethor whose madness has weakened the morale of the soldiers who defend it from enemy forces. Denethor, weakened and aged by the use of the palantir, has been falling further and further into madness and despair but things take a turn for the worse when Minas Tirith comes under assault from a massive army of over a quarter million orcs and enforced by large towers of orc armies moved by trolls and an army of Haradrim on Oliphaunts (Giant elephants). Can Aragorn, who is destined to be the new king of Gondor, save Gondor and return it to it's former glory? Can Frodo withstand the dangerous dark powers of the ring and trust Gollum? The stakes are extremely high and the odds are strongly against the forces of good. Its dark times for all of Middle Earth and it's fate lies by a thread in an increasingly weakened Frodo Baggins.

 The CGI, the costumes, the visual effects and the immense scope of this film are so incredible that I could never find the proper words to explain how great they are. My favorite CGI effects are the long distance shots of the Rohirrim as they charge through the 250,000+ strong Orc Army in front of Minas Tirith, the amazingly detailed CGI rendering of Smeagol/Gollum as well as the shot of the Beacons being lit amidst the cloud-shrouded mountains with the dramatic music as well accompanying it. Ironically enough while the whole movie is astronomically great, the scenes involving Frodo, Sam and Gollum are surprisingly my least favorite up until towards the last hour of the movie. My favorite scenes almost always involved the former members of the Fellowship that fought in Helm's Deep and Pelennor Fields. I don't know why but it is so for me. Shelob was amazingly done and looked almost real in the the way she moved and attacked Frodo and fought against Samwise Gamgee. Her movements almost looked like real life spider footage.

 The movie edition that was seen in theatres is the longest of the three at 3 hours and 20 minutes long! However that's not even close to how long the ""Extended Edition"" is. Although I thought that it would be over five hours long, the extended cut is a full 50 minutes longer than the theatrical cut and the ultimate length of ""Return of The King"" in it's full glory is a whopping 4 hours and 11 minutes long! This is perhaps the longest movie I know of. The only other movie that I think comes close to this long is ""Gone With The Wind"" another timeless classic. What's perhaps the most suprising of the extended edition of this is that unlike the previous two chapters in this saga which merely tacked on unreleased footage, some footage on ROTK is actually replaced with different sequences and some scenes have almost radically different dialog especially when Gandalf along with the main characters who arrive in the flooded Isengard after the Battle of Helm's Deep. The confrontation with the defeated Saruman is perhaps the most surprising part of this extended cut of this film. The ""Voice of Saruman"" scene is absolutely awesome and without a doubt my favorite extra footage on here. Why they did not include this on the regular edition I don't know because it would've been a grand experience to see this on the big screen in the first place when it opened on December 17, 2003. Cutting Christopher Lee's part in this movie to me was an abomination even if the movie was already over 200 minutes long without him involved.

 Unfortunately however, the ""Scouring of The Shire"" was never filmed for the movie editions and to me it is somewhat of a disappointment to me even though I was always doubtful of it ever being included in the film but then again the ending as a whole was among the most powerful endings ever. The biggest surprise and while not as angry as some feel was where Gandalf's staff was actually broken by the Witch-King of Agmar. I know little about how Tolkien wrote out the confrontation between the two but Gandalf is far more powerful than the Witch-King ever was. Gandalf was from a powerful race of wizards called the Maiar while the Witch-King was just a member of the race of men who while more powerful was once good but then was corrupted and brought under the control of Sauron's will and that's what transformed him into the evil being he became towards the end. One of my favorite new scenes while brief was the Mouth of Sauron. While I never had a very clear image of what he looked like, Peter Jackson and the crew created an awesome rendition of him and featured actor Bruce Spence (The guy who played the Trainman in ""Matrix Revolutions).

 The latter two discs are among my favorite bonus features of all three ""Extended Edition"" movies in their expanded sets. My favorite is the third disc in which one actually goes behind the scenes and seeing the mammoth tasks that were accomplished in building the many sets that many scenes were filmed on. Man Oh Man! The sets are absolutely eye-opening and I almost though that Jackson was almost completely nuts when it came to making the many models, miniatures, and sets for the many scenes throughout the movie. It's outright outrageous but great. In fact out of all of the three movies, the ""Appendices"" DVD is just about as great as the movie itself. I'm not putting down the previous two but the ""Appendices"" DVDs on the third LOTR movie are the best out of all of them.

 The ""Gift Set"" edition comes with a fifth DVD as well featuring footage of the orchestra and Howard Shore directing the musical score. While not necessarily a treasure, the ""Gift Set"" is a great buy for the amazingly detailed Statue of the city of Minas Tirith. I don't know about you but I think that it's awesome and far more appealing than the statues of Gollum or the pointing statues from the ""Fellowship"" gift set.

 ""The Lord Of The Rings"" set a high standard in filmmaking that I doubt will be surpassed in our lifetimes, if ever and to see Peter Jackson actually succeed in creating these movies is unbelievable. Thank you Peter for these amazing movies. How you did I may never know but I can safely say that you've changed the lives of so many in such great ways.

 Don't necessarily throw out the regular editions of ""Return of The King"" because it is great in it's own way but the ""Extended Edition"" is perhaps the best DVD set you might find your self ever purchasing. I guarantee it. And so an epic sage comes to a glorious end. I guess it's time to say farewell to an era in movie history. :( :)",1103155200,9,8558,4.6056430446194225
7274462,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"Yes, this was indeed the best movie of the three in it's theatrical version and worthy of the accolades. Yes, Peter Jackson took source material that most people thought was unfilmable and created a (most likely) timeless classic. And like many I awaited with some anticipation the extended version, not for the ""extras"" regarding filming, editing etc (do people really have time to watch all that stuff? Geez, time to unplug a little) but for Jackson to work the same magic he did with the other extended versions.

Well, this time the results were more mixed than previously due to two scenes. One, the meeting between the witch king and Gandalf. It was enthralling to see the flaming sword, but breaking Gandalf's staff?? C'mon. I'm no Tolkien scholar (I've read the book a couple times) and realize why they did it from a film making perspective but... no way.

Second, and far worse is the Houses of Healing. One of the best parts of the book. A gentle coda between the Battle and the final march to the gates. I was looking forward to seeing it. And what do we get?? A Hallmark special. A sappy song with Aragorn applying some washcloth to Eowyn. I almost grabbed the disc and used it as a coaster. What about Merry? He looked half dead after Pippin dug him out from under a couple of orc carcasses and then he's jaunting off with the rest 5 minutes later.

Otherwise, excellent. Extended version of Fellowship is still the best.",1103155200,5,1435,4.6196078431372545
7274463,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This past week, I had the rare privilege of watching the Lord of the Rings with someone who had never seen it.  He is a friend of my youngest brother (17 years old, in High School), and I figured that if he was watching these films for the first time, he might as well watch the extended editions.

He saw Fellowship 2 weekends ago and loved it.  Then he saw the Two Towers last Saturday, and was very eager to see the final chapter.  Incidentally, the last extended edition was out this past Tuesday, and yesterday, my brother, this friend and I sat for the Return of the King and watched it from beginning to end, integrated scenes and all.

To be able to see the expressions of shock, wonder, suprise, and conviction as someone watches the Lord of the Rings movies for the first time; the feelings of cinematic release that I myself went through when I was introduced to these films, is quite hard to put in words.  Let's just say another fan has been added to the list.

Just as magical was being able to suprise and shock my younger brother and his friends even more with the enriched history and sheer emotion of the books; describing the last chapter in the ""Two Towers"", and how intense 'The Choices of Master Samwise' is as you read it, and how you do not want to stop reading the rest of the story until the very cracks of Mount Doom have come and gone; seeing their eyes widen and their curiousity abound as I explain the history behind some of the amazing detail that has been included in these films, like Shelob's mother (Ungolianth), or Erendil's light; the saga of the Valar and the Silmarillon, and Morgorth and his many Balrogs.

The best part of this experience in Middle Earth is more personal.  Last night my younger brother and his friend asked why, once the climax had passed, there was a need to show so much of the aftermath.  I realised then that while it took courage for Frodo and the fellowship to fight their battles and face their fears, especially with almost no hope; once the worst arrived, and the sacrifices were made, a new courage was needed, to face life after 'The End of All things', and to continue to live it.  I told them about the casualties of war, and how so many soldiers who have served and suffered, return home, only to find their lives can no longer be the same.  Many do not know how to go on living a normal life after experiencing the horror and pain that comes from war.  It takes courage to keep on living, to find happiness that brings peace.

For me, this movie shows what courage is like - it shows the many forms of courage.  Not 6 months ago, my other, older brother (27 years old, graphic designer) died very suddenly, and tragically.  One moment very close, the next, ripped out of my life; once living and breathing, funny and God fearing, my mentor - my friend; now, only memories - many, many good, some sad, all, usually painful.  It takes courage to persevere past the pain of losing a loved one, and struggling, fighting to find meaning, happiness, and faith in life - happiness that will bring peace.

These movies are much more than entertainment or great cinema, they are instruments of hope, spanning the spectrum of life's deepest sorrows, and most meaningful truths.  They are a treasure, truly, truly dear and precious to me.

For that, I am thankful.",1103155200,46,3328,4.478476821192053

7274468,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This is in response to the reviewer who believes that the Witch King had the power to break Gandalf's staff. I'm siding with the reviewer who said it was ""profane"" and impossible.

In Unfinished Tales Manwe asks Olorin (Gandalf) to be the third messenger to Middle Earth, as an answer to the reawakening of Sauron. Olorin was noted for being the wisest of all the Maiar, and he remarked that he was ""too weak for such a task, and that he feared Sauron."" Manwe said, essentially, that was all the more reason he should go. (Like the man who says he has not what it takes to be King - all the more reason for him to be King.) Most readers believe that Gandalf's fear of Sauron was tied into Sauron's relentless malice, not that Sauron was so much stronger than he. That his ""fear"" was the fear of wisdom, not of cowardice.

Two pages later Tolkien writes, ""To the defeat of Sauron would [Manwe] not then send some...mighty spirit of the angelic people, one coeval and equal, doubtless, with Sauron in their beginnings, but not more? Olorin was his name.""

Gandalf and Sauron shared the same beginnings, are from the same race, and are, as Tolkien notes, conteporaries and equals. When Gandalf slew the Balrog of Moria (also a member of the Maiar, twisted by Morgoth as was Sauron), he was, as the other reviewer noted, cleansed and sent back greater than he was. So much stronger that even Saruman's considerable strength (Saruman was also one of the Maiar, and the first chosen as ""messenger"" to Middle Earth upon the reawakening of Sauron.

Now, the Witch King is not infused with Sauron's power. That is a direct misinterpretation of the character of the Witch King and the source of their power. All of the Nazgul were men of Numenor - and the men of Numenor were mightier than ""regular"" men. Sauron wooed them with rings of power, and brought them under his control.

They derived much of their power from the rings they carried, not from Sauron - and this includes the Witch King.

What must be remembered is that Gandalf himself - although it is not mentioned in the movie - bears one of the elven rings, Narya the Great, the Ring of Fire. Given that Gandalf bears a far greater ring than the Witch King, is of a greater ""race"", and has been cleansed and strengthened when he was already Sauron's near-equal, it is impossible to imagine that a mere human could have broken his staff.",1103068800,11,2388,4.554778554778554
7274469,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"While good, not substantially better then the theatrical version.  I'm sorry to say that I was quite disappointed after anticipating the extended version for so long.  My problem is that, by and large, the extra scenes did not add to the movie as I had expected and hoped.  There were a few scenes that did add to the movie (though I won't mention them and be a spoiler for those waiting to get this in their Christmas stocking), and even though the drinking contest between Gilmi and Legolas was amusing, it really didn't add anything.  My main problem was I was expecting (maybe unreasonably) so much more from the scenes involving the House of Healing, and the blooming of the relationship of Faramir and Eowin.  It seemed to me, that these scenes didn't total more then five or six minutes and were so incomplete that Jackson could just have well left them out all together.

I thought that the extended versions of both The Fellowship and The Two Towers were substantially better then the theatrical versions, but, for some reason, the extended version of Return of The King simply does not do that much for me (even though RoTK was my favorite episode of the trilogy).  It seemed that Jackson just wanted to add more footage to increase length and wasn't concerned with what he added.  It seemed to me that they were getting tired of the project and just wanted to be done with it as soon as possible.

Sorry to sound negative.  I loved the trilogy and think that overall Jackson did a phenomenal job of all three movies.  I just think they really dropped the ball on the extended version of RoTK.",1103068800,11,1603,4.589473684210526

PERIOD!

First off, the film were adapted from the best fantasy literature has to offer, Tolkien's LOTR trilogy!  No other fantasy movie to my recollection boasts such strong source material.  Second, and this may anger some LOTR purists, but I feel the movies were faithful to the spirit of Tolkien, if not always to the letter of Tolkien.  Let's face it, you couldn't take LOTR and make a movie without some alterations.  The written word flows much differently than a live movie.  Frankly, I wouldn't want to sit through a completely faithful rendition of Tolkein; it'd be waaaay too long and too slow in many parts.  Third, this series of movies took special FX to a whole new level!  The battle sequences were--in a word--AWESOME!

The amazing thing of it all is the three theatrical releases totaled 9 hours and 20 minutes, and it still seemed too short!  Take into account the nearly extra 2 hours of material in the extended editions, and there was still stuff that had to be cut out.  It pains me to read some of the reviews or talk to some of my Tolkien purist friends and hear them complain.  I don't envy Peter Jackson's position in this.  He was in the unenviable position of taking one of the most loved books of all time and making it into a movie; knowing ahead of time that picky purists would complain.  In all honesty, I think after watching all three movies that Peter Jackson managed to capture the main story line extremely well.  A person who never heard of Tolkien before (like my kids) could watch the movies and enjoy them immensely.  As a side-note, think of the interest Jackosn's films have generated in Tolkien's books.  People who have never read the books are reading them.

7274474,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Virtually all of the extended and new scenes added depth, meaning, and fluidity to the film, which the theatrical release lacked. I saw the theatrical release with a person who had never read the books, and much confused him. For example, what happened to Saruman? Where did he go? When asked, ""What of the White Wizard,"" why did the Witch King of Angmar reply, ""I will break him,"" only to have nothing come of it. For myself, I wondered why the scene with the Mouth of Sauron had been deleted, and very much wanted to see it.

The two questions my friends posed were answered. There's so much to comment on here that it would be impossible to touch on everything with any depth, so I'm going to pick the three additional scenes noted above and focus on them.

First, some comments on the film itself. As with the previous two movies, I was disappointed with the theatrical release, mainly because of the removal of the scenes I will discuss later, but also because the film lacked a coherent fluidity. Even so, I was left breathless at the accomplishments of Jackson and his team. The special effects were and are the finest I've ever seen. Just as I felt that I was deep within a mountain while the Fellowship was in the Mines of Moria, so also I felt that I was immersed within a battle to save Minas Tirith. The construction of that city, and its destruction, was beautifully done. The confrontation with the dead was appropriately eerie, and the effects surrounding that scene tremendous. There isn't enough to say about the ingenious special effects, nor the manner in which the battle scenes played out, and how all of the characters interacted with each other.

But the story lacked. Saruman cannot simply disappear without explanation, especially when he is such a central character to the story. I believe that the exclusion of ""The Voice of Saruman"" from the theatrical release was Jackson's second biggest mistake (I'll get to the biggest in a moment). The scene itself was curiously crafted. Saruman spoke to them from the top of the five hundred foot tower of Orthanc, and it's difficult to believe that conversations without multiple utterances of ""what?"" could have occurred. In the book, Saruman and Grima were much lower. That is, though, a minor point, and we can allow for the suspension of disbelief.

There was one surprise in the scene: Saruman, angered by Gandalf's softly spoken urges to join with them, sent a blast of fire from his staff that engulfed Gandalf in flames, and when the flames die out Gandalf still sat astride Shadowfax, and he and his steed are untouched. Saruman, for the first time in the film, shows a decided lack of confidence, if not panic. That did not happen in the book, and as somewhat of a purist, I was taken aback. Then I realized that it was an appropriate representation of Gandalf's ascension, his apotheosis. Then Gandalf spoke the words I had been longing to hear since the theatrical release of The Two Towers: ""Saruman, your staff is broken"". It's breaking was such a welcome sight. That Saruman then slaps down Grima in an expression of almost helpless rage, and Grima in turn chooses that moment to stab Saruman in the back, sending him plunging to his death in a most horrific fashion, was appropriate, as The Scouring of the Shire was not going to be part of the film. This was a most satisfying scene.

Far less satisfying was ""The Witch Kings Hour"". Something obscene and profane happened within this scene; something impossible within the context of the universe that Tolkien created. I can imagine him revolving in his grave like a turbine. When the Witch King swooped down into Minas Tirith to confront Gandalf, I expected something similar to the scene described above. I expected a physical confrontation, although it did not exist in the book, and for the Witch King to be harmed, to an extent. Instead, the Witch King broke Gandalf's staff and Gandalf was thrown from his horse. Jackson, as a rabid fan of Tolkien's work, and surrounded by others who were also rabid fans, should have known better.

Laugh if you will, but I almost shut the movie off at that point, so great was my  frustration. It's one thing to alter events to try and broaden the appeal of a movie (e.g., the inclusion of Arwen), one thing again to include things that didn't happen in the book to offer some form of structural symbolism (e.g., Gandalf being engulfed in flame), but it's another thing entirely to have something happen that could not *possibly* have happened. The Witch King of Angmar was no feeble opponent, to be certain, but he was only a man. Gandalf was not only of the race of the Maiar (within Tolkien's mythos, I analogize the Maiar to angels), he had also been reborn, sent back to Middle Earth cleansed and ""greater"". No man, regardless of his form, regardless of any ring he may wear, regardless of the power that runs within him, *could have possibly broken Gandalf's staff*. It disgusted me, as it should every fan of The Lord of the Rings. It was impossible, and entirely unforgivable.

More satisfying was ""The Mouth of Sauron"". Aragorn, Gandalf and others approached the Black Gates and demanded that Sauron come forth. Instead, Sauron sent his Lieutenant, who sought to chide the group with insults from a mouth in dire need of a dentist with a good saw and grinder, and with Frodo's garments. Although it didn't happen in the book, Aragorn tired of his babbling and chopped off his head. Jolly good fun that was.

Regardless of my disgust with the ""The Witch King of Angmar"", this still stands as one of the most remarkable accomplishments in cinematic history, and the result for this fan of Tolkien's work was immense satisfaction. Kudos, Mr. Jackson.",1103068800,8,5734,4.726
7274475,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Yes, the trilogy is beautiful, awe-inspiring, magnificent, etc.

BUT...there are two areas in which I found both the theatrical and EE deficient.

First:  You remember in ""Fellowship"", Frodo puts on the ring three times, and Peter takes us all three times into the shadowy world that results.  Killer stuff.  Ever since ""Fellowship"" I'd been waiting for what would happen when Frodo puts on the ring at the brink of Mt. Doom.  It could have been incredible--Frodo's heightened sense of Sauron, and edits back and forth between Gollum's weird fight-with-thin-air, and Frodo's perception of the fight from inside the wraith-world.  But all we got from the theatrical was Gollum bouncing around in the air.  I held out some hopes this would be improved in the EE, but it wasn't. Opportunity lost.

Second:  A semi-glaring plot defect in the theatrical was the omission of Denethor's palantir--the reason why he was such a deluded, depressed mess.  Surely this would be corrected in the EE, I thought.  But again, no.  The palantir Aragorn uses towards the end MIGHT have been Denethor's, but might also have been the one Gandalf confiscated from Orthanc.  It's not really clear.  Either way, Peter's omission left Denethor's character motivation unclear.  My wife, who never waded through the book, said, ""Well, I assumed he was just kind of crazy.""

Anyway--those are my gripes.  Probably small in the grand scheme of things.  For the remaining 99.9% of the movie, Hail Peter!  Your incredible work will stand for a lifetime.",1103068800,5,1523,5.064516129032258
7274476,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed all three in the series and I own all three extended versions.  ROtK's ext version, like the previous two, includes fantastic footage.  It gives me new respect for Peter Jackson and his difficult decisons.

Many extended movies and director's cuts contain scenes that are absolute crap and deserve to be omitted.  These three are special because extra scenes improve the quality & continuity of the film.

If I could order a dream version of these films, though, I think I would remove all the scenes with Frodo & Sam from the second and third movies.  You need those scenes for the plot, and they were admirably acted, but I will use the mighty Skip button on them on future viewings.  This is not anyone's fault - in reading the books, I was always ready to get away from Frodo & Sam.

All in all, though, this was a landmark trilogy.  In movie-dome, it strikes me as StarWars 2000.  It is a trilogy beyond what people have seen before.",1103068800,,959,4.555555555555555
7274477,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I had been so looking forward to this extended edition because a lot of scenes I was hoping to see in the theatrical release were cut out.  While ROTK was a very good movie, it seemed choppy at times.  The extended edition removes the choppiness and flows like a movie should.  I have to admit I was intially disappointed in the highly-hyped 'confrontation of Saruman and Gandalf'.  I kept hearing it was a 7-minute battle.  No, it's a 6 minute dialogue between Saruman, Grima, Theoden, and Gandalf with less than 30 seconds of actual 'battle scenes'.  While I very much understood why Peter Jackson decided to not include the burning of the Shire sequence, I was very happy to know that Saruman's death stayed true to the books - even if it occurred in the wrong place.

All the extra scenes in this movie are not really necessary, but they sure add a lot to the experience.  I was very pleased how many more battle scenes were added, especially the ones with Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas - who were very much robbed of scenes in the theatrical release.  The new Paths of the Dead scenes were very well done, as was the Mouth of Sauron sequence.  I enjoyed Gandalf and the Witch King sequence, and it was nice to know that Theoden and his riders actually saved Gandalf's life during the fight.  Sam and Frodo have a few new scenes, but most of the new scenes contained all the other characters - good to see Merry with more scenes added.

In conclusion, this DVD made me really LOVE this movie.  I couldn't stay that before this edition.  I liked the movie, but it was my least favorite of the three.  Now, I can say this movie is just as good if not better than the other two.  This extended edition certainly does not disappoint at all... unless you fell victim of all the 'Saruman-Gandalf battle' hype that I did.  I give very high marks to Peter Jackson for making these movies without going overboard on effects.  It was a great story to tell and these are my favorite movies of all-time and favorite trilogy of all-time.",1103068800,7,2026,4.4890710382513666

7274481,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"There really isn't anything else I can about the Peter Jackson's movie THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING that hasn't been said before. The movie is the 3rd part of the most ambitious cinematic gamble in movie history which not only payed off, but payed off big time.  This 4 DVD box set comes in a nifty blue-colored case and concludes the story that began with THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. Like it's predecessors, it's chock full of extras and includes almost an hour's worth of extra footage that wasn't seen in the original theatrical release. The set is worth purchasing for those scenes alone. Unlike some of the stuff that was originally cut in the 1st two films, much of the extra footage here are things that compliment the story, but aren't necessary to the action. However, the one scene I wish they would have kept in the original edition was that of the Fall of Saruman--it's the only scene that really should have been included, especially seeing how THE TWO TOWERS ended. Whatever the case, you can watch both versions yourself with this box set and decide on your own. Besides the extra footage there's enough special features (not including all the commentaries) to keep a person busy for at least two or three days straight. If you've purchased the first two special editions you can add this one to your collection and basically own your own private film school--outside of the technical things film school teaches you and a few contacts you might make, these DVDs provide everyone who wants it an education equivalant to what film school provides. With THE LORD OF THE RINGS Peter Jackson has done what very few directors are able to do: change the way Hollywood makes movies. However, Peter Jackson also changed the way that Hollywood looks at DVDs and illustrated the potential this particular form of media has.  He is the King of the DVDs and it's so good to watch his triumphant return in its full glory.",1102982400,5,1962,4.651296829971182
7274482,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"How do you take something that is utterly amazing and make it better?  Well, Peter Jackson and his talented crew have further improved the Return of the King.  The loving attention to detail and the professionalism in this new version is amazing.

  The extended version is truly a new movie.  It follows the book much more closely and the time sequence of the battles coordinates better with all the things going on in the background. The extended version allows the actors to better develop their characters.  The extra features are also well worth the price of the DVD. There were only one or two short shots that could have been left out, but there are so many new shots that improve the overall effect, it is truly amazing.

  Since this is just a DVD version that would probably sell a lot of copies no matter what they put out, they didn't need to put so much effort into it.  But each department has come up with such amazing attention to detail and completed everything so well that it is like getting an entirely new movie.  The score, the special effects, the acting, the editing: all the departments have done a top notch job.

  I was a little sad in thinking that last year was the final chapter in Lord of the Rings, little did I know that Peter Jackson and all the myriad of people working on the LOTR series had a Christmas present coming for the world in 2004: the extended version of The Return of the King.",1102982400,3,1426,4.4517374517374515
7274483,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Star Wars has it's time and place...and sadly, it is the 70's and 80's, and in the 90's...the language, dimensions and magic fell flat as it became clear Lucas never grew up while locked in his ""castle"" over on Skywalker Ranch. Juxtaposed with that fallen star, is Peter Jacskon, a man who takes into his grubby, stubby little hands, that torch, and leaps to far new heights. And, we, the viewer, are led to the final tale that swept the Academy Awards for 11 golden men. The filmworld was silenced and trampled by this masterpiece of modern cinema...the melding of special effects, acting, high drama and powerful storytelling, and that was just to muzzle Michael Moore! ;)

The modern myth...which is why I bring Star Wars into this little online review, because Lucas was a prime example in our late 20th century....was originally delivered far better by Tolkien during the dark days of a world at war and industrialization invading as a Brave New World came clear...and Tolkein wrote, with deep passion and love, a cautinary tale of power, atavism and imperialism railing against the common folk, who must forge old alliances to meet and triumph over the dark forces at work. Tolkein was a deeply relgious man, and his true faith was his trust in the good heart of man, or more aptly, hobbits. And through Hobbits, and their sincere and open humanity, would be the very fulcrum to meet and defeat the forces of evil.

Peter Jackson uses the final film to paint the widest and most colorful brushstrokes of his great triptych. There is great unease and impending malice from the very beginning of the film, as he weaves Tolkein's characters to the final showdown that doesn't take place so much on the battlefield, but in Mordor, in it's very bowels...the future rests on two hobbits who face the biggest evil of them all, who Sauron truly represents...the evil of themselves/ourselves.

With 50 more minutes and bountiful features galore, Return of the King is more than just the final chapter of a glorious 3 movie run that made us ALL children again in awe...but a start of a true melding of special effects/technology and the craft of filmaking/storytelling and acting...creating a masterpiece that has made an indelible mark upon film, the modern myth...besides my wallet, this holiday season.",1102982400,5,2301,4.879795396419437

The Saruman death scene (best new scene), Gandalf vs. The Witch King, and the Mouth of Sauron are the scenes that really stand out, but even the tiny ones (Houses of Healing) make this film closer to the book. This is not only my favorite of the three films, it contains the most ""precious"" added footage too.

It rounded out the story a bit more and I hardly even noticed the 4 hours it took to get from start to finish.

The Appendices are, as with the first two movies, wonderfully informative. Not only do they include some of the more technical information on how scenes were created and such, but they include personal experiences and stories from the cast and crew that make you actually feel the bond they shared while filming these three movies.

7274487,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I approached this extended edition of Return of the King with more enthusiasm than the other two extended editions because of the information that 50 minutes were added to the film!  This was more than a fan of the books and films could have hoped for.  There is so much added in the extra footage that sets the mood for the film much more concretely right from the get go, that I was completely enthralled all over again like I was when I saw the film in theaters.  I think that there is no one who will dislike the additions; they are extremely well incorporated into the flow of the film.  What follows is a review of the extended cut of Return of the King (the first two dvd's).  I have not watched the appendices but am sure they are phenomenal as well.

Now for some spoilers.  Smeagol and Deagols sequence is a bit longer and more intense, The Saruman sequence is worth seeing, because we did not really get closure to his storyline in the theatrical cut...  It is good to see Christopher Lee as Saruman and Brad Douriff as Grima Wormtongue one more time... It makes sense that Lee was upset that his part in the third film was cut for the theaters, it is a great final scene for the character, and is integrated here.

We get extra details about the decline of Gondor, well worth it..  We also get more Palantir scenes (one extended with Pippin, and a brand new sequence with Aragorn).  There is a scene with the Witch King and Gandalf that just blew me away, as well as The Mouth of Sauron at the gates of Mordor, a tense moment in the books, and here reinserted for fans...  There is an extra scene with the Dead army.  In addition, there is some extra development of the romance that Faramir and Eowyn will share (like the books) which was only shown in one scene in theaters at the end when the two appear together in frame. We even get a very small Boromir cameo!!!

The extended sequences are integrated so well it is hard to see when the theatrical version ends and the extra footage begins.  But that is besides the point, this is a reworked version, and includes the theatrical version and 50 minutes of new footage for a total running time of over four hours! Even new music has been integrated!!!  Now we all can go and watch the three extended cuts as one long film and enjoy the experience all over again... Peter Jackson has outdone himself again.

I have heard several people make this claim and then give specific examples of how the movie doesn't follow the exact events or some of the main characters do things differently or have been moved.  You can definately see some interpretation of the story That's plot not ""spirit"".

Things were definitely changed throughout the series, characters left out, some fleshed out more, events moved to other ""books"" or changed, dialogue put in the mouths of other characters.  Watch some of the excellent commentaries included in the extended version DVD's and you will even get to hear some of the reasons behind these choices.

This is simply the best DVD series ever made for a book translated into film.  You don't have to agree with the choices Peter Jackson and his writers made, but you do at least get to hear about those choices from them in their commentaries.  Nearly an hour of extra footage is included in this beast of a movie- complete with integrated musical score.  This was a labor of love, no one can refute that.

7274490,1,B00Z9YZRVE,"When I first went to see ""Return of the King"", I eventually gave up and walked out of the theater two hours into the movie. Last week I finally had to see the final hour and a half, just to satisfy my curiosity (mostly just to finally see Gollum suffer a well-deserved death) and rented the DVD. Then I remembered why I was so frustrated and impatient in the theater the first time. This is the most overblown, bloated, and exagerated hogwash I've ever been coerced into sitting through in my entire life. It makes the mediocre ""Titanic"" seem like an artistic masterpiece. It could almost inspire me to see second-class trash like ""Bad Santa"", although ""Return of the King"" is far more tortuous because of its incredible never-ending length. Sitting through an afternoon tea at the Plaza Hotel with Margaret Thatcher and John McCain would be easier than enduring this. And if I have to see bulbuous-eyed Frodo forgive that green double-crossing midget ring-lover Gollum one more time, before he vanishes into the boiling lava (finally--a merciful death for moviegoers if there ever was one) or watch another hammy gaze or hammy expression of the immensely hammy and cheesy Viggo Mortensen, I just might throw up. It's amazing the depths that standards have sunk to when this pathetic trash melodrama is given eleven Academy Awards! Ben-Hur deserved it, but never this crap. If you want to see what a great movie can be, rent the DVD of Gone With the Wind or Chinatown or The Black Stallion or The Magnificent Ambersons. If it weren't such a travesty, the fact that this film is hyped as ""a great epic"" would be just a joke. The heights to which ""Return of the King"" is exalted prove that the incompetence and greed of today's Hollywood is matched only by the base stupidity and low standards of today's mass film audiences.

7274491,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I bought this package three days ago. I've had a bit of time on my hands and watched it pretty constantly. I STILL HAVE NOT SEEN EVERYTHING. Be warned, this is huge.

Like the previous two extended editions,the ROTK offers a plethora of genuinely fascinating documentaries. The extended movie itself seemed to be a much better version. You would have to be a true hardcore fan to watch it all in a single sitting (I managed about three) but it is more gripping, more suspenseful and more entertaining than the already marvellous theatrical cut.

You can understand Jackson's cutting of some scenes. The theatrical edition obviously achieved it's purpose, and you know while watching some of the deleted scenes that they simply would not have worked in the commercial cinema. But to be able to spread out, and take the time to fully appreciate the story, is a symbol of Jackson's perfect balance between the commercial needs of cinema and to demonstrate a genuine heart to what he calls 'the biggest home movie ever.'

The documentaries do their best to please, but obviously to see all of them you will need to consider yourself quite a big fan. To me, at least, they all seemed to be very interesting. I was genuinely surprised. Who knew that a 30-minute documentary on all the horses would actually be very funny? It is, trust me.

The best documentary by far is to be found on the last disc. The almost feature-length 'Cameras in Middle-Earth' explores the actors constructions of their scenes. This, to me, was the most interesting.

The true miracle of these documentaries is that you feel like an observer into a family album. Obviously, the ending of the appendicies, and therefore the LOTR films forever, is quite emotional. Grab a hanky.

I am no big fan of the original books, so I can't really comment on the adaptation. But I will say that the extended movie cut does seem like a more Tolkien version of events. However, the movies should never be seen as an attempt at Tolkien. It is an interpretation of Tolkien, and one that has done it's best to capture the spirit and essence of the books. I think it improved upon the story.

Overall, buy this. It's excellent, wonderful and marvellous. Even if you don't consider yourself a huge fan, if you have a spare couple of days and you watch this, you'll probably end up being one.

This film, in time, I'm sure will be considered a masterpiece of cinema. An absolute must-have. A relic of modern movie history.",1102723200,,2471,4.690531177829099

7274494,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Much has been, and undoubtedly will be, said about Peter Jackson's remarkable trilogy of films based on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. What this extended dvd does, as the other volumes in this series also did, is to show just how much love and care went into the making of this film.

The exhaustive special features cover every single aspect of production and what always makes it great is that when something is mentioned we cut to footage of it actually happening. If a particular drawing is highlighted during an interview, the picture appears. This shows how keen Jackson was to let people know how it all came together. The fact that 99% of the cast and crew contribute to this dvd by way of commentary and/or interviews proves that this was indeed a happy location.

Fans of the series will not wait for any reviews, they will buy it anyway, and they will not be disappointed. The new footage is interesting, if not entirely necessary. I particularly liked the Sauruman sequence, the extended paths of the dead sequence, the drinking contest between Gimli and Legolas and Mouth of Sauron sequence.

The sound and picture are both superb and will definately give your widescreen tv and surround system a decent working over.

7274495,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Making a decent film version of LotR has always been considered nearly impossible, yet somehow Peter Jackson pulled it off. In spite of the need to eliminate parts of the book for the sake of the cinematic medium, much of the emotional power and magic of Tolkien's storytelling remain. While the scenes of Frodo struggling up Mt. Doom may seem a bit long and probably could have been a bit more effective if a bit shorter, otherwise, this is an exciting film with real character development and strong emotional content. Don't let complaints about ""numerous endings"" throw you off; the final scenes of the film do their best to wrap up all the open storylines much in the same way that Professor Tolkien did in his book, and it's very satisfying to watch. Keep a box of tissues next to you if you're the emotional type.

My one complaint about this film was that of all the scenes from the LotR book to omit, how could you cut the scene where the two most powerful antagonists, Gandalf and the Witch King, face each other? This is a key moment in the story both dramatically and as an exciting piece of action, and I've never been able to understand the editorial decision to cut that scene, but thankfully, that footage, which appeared in pre-release trailers yet was cut from the theatrical film, is restored. Also appearing in the extended DVD version are the many moments with Christopher Lee as Saruman that were cut from the theatrical release.

I'm anxiously looking forward to this extended DVD version of the film, more so even than I was the theatrical release a year ago.

I read the books after the movie version The Two Towers because I couldn't wait for the Return of the King. The book is wonderful of course, and I was imagining each shot on the screen as I read. But that created the problem when I saw Return of the King, I was unconsciously comparing the movie to the book. Yes some stories were cut and lines were switched, but most importantly I was just waiting to see what I already know is going to happen. I think I understand a little bit about the disappointment of expectation when juggling between the book and film, or one's own imagination and someone else's vision.

Yet from all that I saw in the theater, DVD, as well as magazine and online reviews, I'm convinced that Peter Jackson and Co. have made these films with love, respect, dignity, superb creativity and skills. There are so much attention to detail, think about casting, costume, weapons and make ups, not to mention cinematography, scores, FX and acting. Perhaps I'm just a kid at heart, but I was, and still am, moved when Frodo volunteer to take the ring to Mordor, terrified at Helm's Deep and touched again when all bowed down to the hobbits...now if that's cheesy so be it, I ENJOYED every minute of it!

I have watched the films over and over again (Fotr is still my favorite) and have not lose one bit of excitement but have actually discover something new each time.

The LOTR Trilogy represents a monumental effort by thousands of people over 5 years, because after all, filmmaking is a COLLABORATIVE process.  The Return of the King was my favorite of the three.

Peter Jackson should have more footage of the Elven goddess, Lady Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) in THE RETURN OF THE KING Extended Edition. All we see or hear of her beautiful radiance is of helping Frodo in Shelob's lair, and later at the Grey Havens, ready to vacate Middle-earth forever.

Galadriel did not break her solemn promise of bidding Aragorn farewell, as depicted in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING Extended Edition. She should have made a cameo appearance at Aragorn's coronation in Minas Tirith.

As an Elf, and as a Ringbearer, the strong and wise Galadriel is the best character in the whole trilogy. This is because she is as old as the First Age, and came from Valinor. She should not only be advising the Fellowship and prophesizing Frodo's quest, but kicking ass with her Ring of Power also.

So, please, Peter Jackson. Reconsider and put more Galadriel in a future THE RETURN OF THE KING release!

First off, the new scenes (like the other two but more so with the first) improve the film. It is easy to see that for the most part time was the reason for deletion. The final confrontation of Saruman was wonderful. As was Aragorn talking to the Eye before the battle, a scene with Aragorn and group taking the ships (and killing Peter Jackson) was silly and didn't need to be included, as well as take away from the impact of seeing the dead in action later. All in all the new scenes are wonderful and the film is better for it. I will go so far as to say that all three could be a bit longer adding scenes that were shot that include more details from the books. What one should understand that just because there were three books, doesn't mean to say that there should be 3 films, one can't simply have a neat package of 3 if there's more to tell.

My precious..

Finally.. finally..  THE most awaited Dvd in history is there. (that sounds a bit thick i know, but hey, it's the thruth)

The EE versions of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy are SO MUCH better then the original widescreen we all saw in the cinema.
It makes everything better, storywise, humor, character developement, and the whole story more coherent and finished.

There are no mere (like on most Dvd's) some  : here are a few deleted scenes we never finished, have a look at it.
These scenes are beautiful intregrated in the whole story and make it much more richer. And more logical (Gandalf now meeting the WitchKing of Angmar after the Lord Of The Nazgul said in the theatrical version that he was 'going to break him'  but never met him / confronted Gandalf ..(and with Ian McKellens supurb portrayel of Gandalf, that's always a treat)
Well..  he does now! In all it's excellent beauty.
And the Mouth Of Sauron scene.  Great stuff!!

And i'm not even speaking about the tons of tons of excellent extra's on disks 3 and 4.
I can't wait for Smeagul/Gollums audio commentary. Must be hilarious ;)

Behold this Masterpiece.. it's Brillaint! In all it's essence. And then some..
I've seen many, many movies (and books) in my life..  but nothing compares to the sheer excellence of this trilogy.

7274505,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Quite simply the three LOTR films are the finest films ever made.

  Thats a bold statement to make,and before I saw the first one I was lukewarm on the whole Tolkien concept...just buy the three extended versions and you`ll see why a cynic such as myself was swept away by the sheer quality and attention to detail of the movies.

  From Tolkein`s horrific experiences with the Lancashire Fusiliers in the trenches of the first world war to the growing threat of fascism in the 1930s to the  brink of the unthinkable ( ie a Nazi Germany in control of most of the civilized world )it is all in these films through the loss of innocence and the absolute neccesity of going to war. From the Hobbits,who represent innocence,to the Kingdom of Gondor,that represents a war-weary nation such as Britain in the between war years,Tolkein has written a story that mirrors the European experience ( and that of the United States )in the darkest days of the 20th Century.

  I exhort you to buy these films. They are the finest...and amongst the most relevant...ever made.

  As a postscript I advise the extended versions as there is so much quality stuff that did not make it onto the originals you have to see.",1102464000,,1202,4.639810426540285
7274506,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"One mark of an important film is often the discussion it engenders, and the divisions it creates.  Clearly Jackson's take on LOTR has at least achieved that, and probably a good deal more.

That being said, I'm more of a purist (where movies from novels are concerned) than a consumer that eagerly awaits each new Hollywood offering regardless of its on-paper appeal.  I found the last installment the most accessible of the three, but we have to remember that Hollywood and its followers believe in the dollar first, and truth somewhere thereafter.  Concessions will be made (and sold, LOL).

If you can take that, you can accept the film for what it is: an interpretation; impressive in its creation, but not necessarily as faithful as some of us had hoped.

For the purist-bashers, I would remind you that it's unlikely that any of the writers associated with the trilogy will ever have the cajones to create a written work that stands the test of time as Tolkien did. But it's hard not to embellish a classic given the opportunity, no?

Film makers that adapt novels have a two-edged sword with which to play: it's relatively easy to determine if the work the film is based on can appeal to an audience; it's a much trickier task to decide how to make it a success on-screen.  Count me in the camp of abridging content rather than inventing it, but what's done is done.

There's an old joke about about Cecil B. deMille, something to the effect of ""what I would do if I were God"", connected with his version of the Ten Commandments.  I can't remember at the moment how it goes however.  It's a bit apropos to the film version of LOTR in some ways.",1102464000,2,1651,4.562711864406779
7274507,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This really is the DVD to ""Rule Them All"".

  While it is true that these movies are not completely accurate to J.R.R. Tolkien's mighty work, I do believe that Peter Jackson did a wonderful and superb job coverting this epic tale to the completely different fantasy arena of Films. The imagination of the mind is completely different from the reality of sight, and so, though the movies are different, they are amazing!

  I love how they incorporated so much of the Tolkien's wonderful books into this masterpiece of film, all the flavor, the languages, as much as they could cram in, and how wonderfully it all turned out. I have watched these movies progress from start to finish. These Special Extended Editions are the complete results of their efforts. The Return of the King is the Triumphant Finish. How wonderful it has all been, and how sad that it has come at last to the ""End of All Things"".

 The Extended Editions bring the movies to their fulness, as they always should have been. I applaud!!!

  It has been a long, hard wait for this movie, but I am sure that it will be worth it all.

  There are, admittedly, differences that I did not like, but I am not going to let those worry me.

We've see it in Star Wars and the Matrix, the failure of the closing chapter to set one imagination on fire, and to some degree I think it can be said the same for Return of the King. But in comparison to SW or MR, we see a closing chapter that continues the quality of the first two installments, and although the wow factor diminishes, the quality does not.",1102464000,5,826,4.37012987012987
7274509,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I'm going to start this review by saying that I never read the Lord of the Rings as a kid (I was preferential to the Dragonlance novels) and my experience reading the Hobbit gave me the impression that Tolkien was an over-wordy image relater, not a storyteller.  However, when I finally did read the books, I realized was that Tolkien's challenge was that he not only had to tell you the story, but he also had to explain the setting for you in detail because he was, in essence, starting a genre of writing.  Let's face it, bookstores didn't have science fiction/fantasy sections when he wrote these books 50 years ago, they have them now as a result of his creations.  Now, back to the movie review.

Much like Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, Return of the King is an adaptation of Tolkien's works.  If these movies were made in strict adherence to the original novels, then each would have been a tedious, 10 hour-long musical - something Hollywood never would have green-lighted in a million years.  Peter Jackson and Barrie Osborne should be commended for taking the whole of Tolkien's story, including the details in the supplemental works, and using it to create a story that flows with characters who invoke a cathartic response from the audience.

Speaking of the audience, I'd like to point out a significant but often overlooked fact to all of the Tolkien purists out there: a distinct majority of the people who paid to see these movies never read the Lord of the Rings books and don't care that Tom Bombadil and the Scouring the Shire were omitted or that elves arrived to fight the battle at Helm's Deep instead of at Minas Tirith.  As Jackson was spending someone else's money making these films, he needed to deliver a finished product that would produce some sort of return on investment.  Thus, we have the versions which were released in the theaters.

And while those films were good enough for the mass audience (Return of the King did happen to win this little award for Best Picture), I would urge everyone and anyone to purchase the extended editions of the films, especially anyone who, like myself, walked out of the theaters after Fellowship of the Ring or the Two Towers shaking their head and muttering obscenities at Jackson and Osborne due to the ""liberties taken with the story"".  The additional footage (almost an hour and half over all three films) will restore your faith in the filmmakers by adding a depth and detail to the stories that, for whatever reason, the theatrical releases could not.",1102464000,,2541,4.713318284424379

7274512,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Strictly adapting JRR Tolkiens work into a film would have been at once impossible and at best irritating to watch. The books are an achievement in literature, in creation of language and world building. That said, something was missing from the books, characters. Those who say the characters in the film do not match the book are shallow on several levels.

First, the Books have no characters, just names and positions in life.

Second, the Appendixes and related stories and writings that influenced the screenplays.

Third, what you think are characters in the book are your perception of the characters Tolkien wrote, Tolkien did little to nothing in character development.

What Peter Jackson did here is nothing short of amazing. He took a long, complicated, stilted text written in the most bland prose -- don't get me wrong I've read the books several times and love them -- but Tolkien was a world builder and a linguist, not a story teller. What he did here was create a grand mythology, not a great adventure or a grand opus.

Now, onto the film.

On a grand scale this film blows every other epic out of the water. Who cares how faithful it is to the book, it's exciting, intelligent, emotional, spellbinding, brilliant and I would kill for a HDTV to view it on for the full 12 hrs.

From the first moment to the last this is a thrilling, enthralling masterpiece made more exciting by the excised footage that shows the final confrontation with Saruman, the voice of Sauron and the romance of Faramir and Eowyn there's a more personal and deeper level to this version.

The 2 extra discs are almost as good as the movies. Oh yeah, after you watch the movies a few times, watch the cast commentary. That stuff is the best.

7274514,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"It's not about ""purism."" It's about consumerism and a culture brought to its intellectual knees.

People who have never read the books (or who don't read books, like Dubbya, our idiot king by another title) will probably enjoy this extended version of Return Of The King. Its original eloquence and grandeur has been sufficiently reduced and elsewise dumbed down so as to accommodate the average modern viewing audience (read: generic McPeople: average reading skills/mental level of about 8th grade development).

However, those who have an appreciation for good storytelling set to film will find Peter Jackson's LOTR Return Of The King to be lackluster and disjointed at best - but certainly an extended special effects extravaganza to be sure. This is what happens when a gaggle of irredeemably mediocre screen writers and other sundry simpletons get their intellectually challenged and rather unwashed hands onto a work of genius. They find the bigness of such works offensive, so they have to reduce it down to their own toady perspective. And thus we have Peter Jackson's masterpiece of plebianity, The Return Of The King, Extended Edition.

Remember, for a film about a story of the length and complexity as such LOTR Return Of The King is to be successful, or more precisely, for it to be popular (consult Roget's Thesaurus regarding synonyms of the word ""populace"" and ""popular""), inexorably required it to be presented in a butchered form; substituting special effects and poorly written, incongruent scenes, each snatched wholesale from the thin air betwixt the educationally impoverished ears of Jackson's maladroit staff of mudlarkean screenwriters. Elsewise the sad fact of the matter is that without the shamelessly stultifying advertising assault to promote this low browed adaptation of Tolkein's works, the legions of American consumers would not so sheepishly flock forth to gleefully view/purchase something so sloppily slapped together as Peter Jackson's mass mediafied magnum opus, the parody known as The Return Of The King.

You wanna make something like Tolkien's works ""accessable?"" You also want to make sure it is a money-making powerhouse? That's simple: Just let some Hollywood morons loose to vulgarize it, and you've got yourself a winner!

Thus, in all honesty maybe it would be more appropriate to rename the film. It should be called ""The Return Of The King, For Dummies.""",1102377600,10,2408,5.276762402088773
7274515,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"The whole story for me begins and ends with the metamorphasis of the hobbits.  That being said, how does Peter Jackson decide to leave out the scene where the hobbits return to the shire and have to defeat Sauraman and Wormtail.  I thought that was a huge mistake when I heard they were leaving that part out of the trilogy.  Other than that it was a good transformation into a long trilogy.",1102377600,9,391,4.402777777777778
7274516,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Like all Tolkien fans, I had once been afraid of this. I had been afraid that our beloved books would be taken by a talentless, indifferent hand and thrown into the horrendous money-making machine. I had been afraid they'd be ground mercilessly and without any consideration for J.R.R. Tolkien's work or for its fans, ground into pieces of overbudgeted FX with not much else left to the eye and to the mind.

What we got instead was nothing short of a masterpiece. Hype? Sure, there's been some hype. But The Lord Of The Rings has rendered the word hype obsolete. It takes that hype and smashes it against a wall of pure brilliance. The final installment is a glorious ending to a trilogy that decades down the road, I have no doubt, will be hailed as one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema. Had I written the review right after seeing it, it would've probably consisted of one word. WHOA. But I'm OK now. I'm fine. I've taken my Advil, drank my three cups of coffee, got good five hours of sleep. I'm OK now. I can finally sit down and write a coherent review.

On the other hand, do I dare? What can you say about a movie which is, for the lack of a better word, perfect? I know, I know. Of course, no movie is perfect. But this one is as damn well close to perfect as it gets. I've been literally put under a spell, very similar to the one that had seized my mind 18 years ago when I first read the books. Flaws and lowdowns? Sure, there are some, but only if you choose to be a grumpy purist who refuses to get it through his head that literature and cinema are two very different media and therefore cannot be the same, will never be the same. This is as great an adaptation as there will ever be. Call me when you make a movie one-tenth this good.

In my eyes, the films are in some ways better than the books. I find it extremely annoying that Tolkien's work is being idealized by his fans. He was but a man and he, too, made mistakes. His books, as detailed and amazing as they are, still aren't perfect. There are characters who do nothing but sit around, scenes the very presence of which is meaningless or at the very least questionable. Think Arwen, think Tom Bombadil... who, while making a part of the story cool and magical, bears next to no impact on the story as a whole (of course, ""true Tolkien fans"" will probably have my head if they read this, but oh well). But above all, it makes my blood boil when I hear things like ""a true visualization of Tolkien's Middle-earth it is not"" (sic. Rogert Ebert). With all due respect, who in the world do you think you are to decide what a ""true visualization of Tolkien's world"" is? No one but Tolkien himself can give us the true visualization of his world, and he's been dead for decades.

Peter Jackson & Co had a task in front of them akin to dragging a cross to the top of Golgotha, in metaphorical terms. And, by all that's sacred, I cannot see how a filmmaker could succeed more in such a task. It is no small feat to accomplish what they have accomplished. Not only have they succeeded, they have exceeded all my expectations. You can see and feel with every shot that this is a labor of love. That goes for everything and everyone in the movie. Cinematographically, it's amazing. The FX were just enough and never cheesy or unnecessary. The score moves you deeply - even the normally annoying Enya did not bother me this time. The acting was splendid, and the cast was simply perfect. I grew up with the characters in my heart, and now they finally have faces. I mean, how many times do you actually read a book, imagine the characters, and then see the movie and realize that the characters look eerily close to what you've imagined them to look like?

I could go further into details about this particular installment, but I don't think Amazon supports reviews that long. I will simply say that I have never been one of those never-happy purists who nitpick even on the quantity of leaves on trees in Rivendell. I believe these movies should be seen for what they are, not for what they are not. Don't sit there and compare it to the book, or complain how something was added or taken away. Know this: if you want to see Tolkien's Middle Earth, you never will. Only Tolkien himself could give you his Middle Earth, and he's long gone. Look at these films from an overall point of view and try to see that it is simply impossible to film such a leviathan in a way that will make everyone happy. And for what it is, this trilogy is a rare gem. It combines end-of-your-seat action with heartbreaking drama, and brings intensity on both visual and emotional levels, which few films have accomplished so far. For me personally, it was also a memorable experience because I got to share it with a hundreds of moviegoers who sat in the theater with me for three years in a row. We watched in silence, lest we miss anything. We wowed at the sight of the dark, vast Moria, the surreal beauty of Rivendell, the fiery grandeur of Mt. Doom. We laughed at the hobbits' painfully sweet naivet. We clapped at the grand finale. We couldn't hold back tears in the last few minutes before the credits rolled. We were there, with them, sharing this timeless tale of friendship, destiny, love, the loss of innocence and the reign of good vs. evil. Sounds trite, I know. But this is probably one story where it's not.

Your mileage may vary.",1102377600,97,5402,4.397
7274517,1,B00Z9YZRVE,"A word of advice to those of you who have been waiting for the extended release, hoping it would clear up some of the missing information.  Know how sadly dissapointed you may be.  I was able to watch a rip of the extended version and I'm glad I did before I ordered it!  Unlike the first two where the extended version added some much needed scenes to fill gaps in the story, this version adds things that never even happened.  In a degree that was shocking and upsetting to me even thought I would not consider my self a Tolkein Purist.  I would have rather not had an extended version and I am sorry but the Scouring of the Shire was a damn important part!  I was okay with it not being in there but instead we get some made up crap, that never happened to Sauraman.  I will be ordering the theatrical release of this movie, at least it is not as far from the book as this version.  If I want the real story I will just pull out my books for a re-read!",1102377600,13,955,4.096774193548387
7274518,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Deserved winner of the Oscar for best picture?  Well, no.  But it's a great film, that stands head and shoulders above the others for what it does.

One gripe that purists all have is that - well - the series of films isn't really the Lord of the Rings, the book.  The characters aren't the characters - Gimli is more flippant, Aragorn more showy, Faramir is less noble, and...well, the list really does go on.  It's a gripe I share, and I do wish that they hadn't been changed.  But the story itself is retained pretty well, mostly, and the general 'feel' of the whole thing - the world itself, which Tolkien loved and detailed with care above and beyond any of his characters - is quite superb throughout.

There are other changes; here and there, you'll see something that didn't happen in the book, or something changed for dramatic effect.  But to the average filmgoer, they simply won't know - these things damage the film as an adaptation of the book, but they certainly don't damage the film as a film.  In fact, quite the reverse - they make the film more energetic, more immediate and more watchable, which is why these changes were made.

A book is not a film, nor a film a book - and the two could never perfectly mirror each other.  What has happened here is that a great story, in a great world, written with slow detail, has inspired a great story, in a great world, written up as a faster, more immediate film.

It's not the book - and people who've seen the film should probably read the books too.  But it's a great film.",1102291200,25,1539,4.395759717314488
7274519,1,B00Z9YZRVE,"While it is easy to admire the scope and effort behind Peter Jackson's TLOTR series, anyone who thinks Jackson was true to Tolkien's masterwork is fooling themselves. There is next to no scene which doesn't either have the wrong characters speaking the wrong lines (ie. as per the book -thus destroying any character development that Tolkien intended) or else an 'introduced' bit of dialogue from the screenwriters themselves which only served to reinforce their new version of the characters. Personally, I love Tolkien's work, and am constantly offended by critics and reviewers alike who think using the same title and character names (but not much more) from the book is some proof that the contents of the books were respected. They were not. So when Galadriel speaks in the first film (FOTR) with lines which came from Treebeard, and when Gandalf 'disposseses' King Theoden of Saruman (?!) (in TTT ) and when Gimli notes that the Army of the Dead 'would come in handy', all my pleasure at these films whithers and dies. Call it as it is, a big effort but a poor effort at bringing an epic to the screen. One might say that by pumping the film full of effects and reducing the dialogue to either simplistic obvious kitsch or cheesy American one liners, Peter Jackson has reduced an epic tale to a disposable 'film of the week'. Well done (sarcasm). As for the Oscar for Best Screen Adaption - give me a break. It couldn't be any worse.",1102291200,24,1440,4.718253968253968

Peter Jackson has really made a master piece with this movie. And I think that any Tolkien purist out there who complains about this movie needs to shut up. You should be happy that he has made one of the best and closest adaptaions we will ever have to these books. Some of the things that he took out of the movie he took out because the movies would be too long and they weren't even important to the plot.

7274521,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"First off, too many people are complaining about the adaptation of the book to the big screen.  What I say to these self-righteous folks is: it 's an adaptation, Peter Jackson preserved every ounce of integrity tackling this hugh project, and sure, a few characters were left out, I've read the books several times too, but you can't perfectly reproduce a set of books like this to the big screen.  It just doesn't happen.  What Peter Jackson did do, was adapt the greatest fantasy story to the big screen very accurately, and I think Tolkien would be proud.

  I have nothing against purists, but come on, be realistic.  These movies were not made for YOU personally, P. Jackson made these films for the masses, while trying not to compromise anything he didn't have to for the sake of time, money, etc.  Even Tolkien historians who had apprehensions about the films before production are agreeing that Peter Jackson did an excellent job of reproducing these stories on the big screen.

  Having said that, the movie is amazing in its scope, power, sense of connection with the characters, and amazing Computer Graphics.  Also, just look at the detail that went into making every single costume and piece of clothing, armor, weapons, jewelry, etc.  It's just awe-inspiring.  Just watch the extras to see exactly how much went into the making of this film.  This really is my new favorite movie ever.",1102291200,4,1400,4.823529411764706

7274523,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Being a big fan of Tolkein's epic story, I was disappointed with the final chapter in Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, THE RETURN OF THE KING. Slow pacing, unnecessary waffling in Rohan, and the complete loss of several great villains, namely Christopher Lee's Saruman, Brad Dourif's Wormtounge and The Mouth Of Sauron (Bruce Spence). When watching ROTK, I could pinpoint the exact moment where Jackson had become a complete sell out. All through FELLOWSHIP and TWO TOWERS the evil istari Saruman has been the main villain, primarily because P.J wanted a more substantial bad guy than a flaming eye. It's like the old saying: ""Every great hero needs a villain"". But for all the great cinematic battles that Saruman unleashes, his character has to come to a spectacular end. The aforementioned point of complete botch-up is where Gandalf, Theoden et all ride to Isengard for no other reason than to pick up a palantri that has little to do with the story. No evil wizard, nothing. Booo! And how unsporting to axe a great villain without even informing Mr. Lee. Now, one could understand that this would be caused as a result of the running time being too long, but then if that's the case, why not shorten the snooze-inducing lighting of the beacons, or axe long sappy hobbit wafflings. Now this would be slightly more acceptable if the main Orc guy leading the hosts of Mordor had a good role, however his fight with Aragorn, which would have been really neat, was unceremoniously ripped from the film. Not to mention the Gandalf and Witch-King fight that never happens in the movie, leaving the Witch King talking to the main orc, who says: ""What of the wizard?"" The Witch King says: ""I will break him!"" Or not.

Now, that's not to say that the movie is without spectacle, indeed the arrival of the Oliphants and some impressive Pellenor Fields fighting is fantastic cinema. And of course Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Bernard Hill etc are all excellent, but the film had an unfinished feel to it. Which of course brings us to the EXTENDED DVD version. Now I can throw the old cinema release DVD away, watch this version with all the mentioned scenes reinstated, and be satisfied.

Someone at NL or AOL thought a final  one-to-one battle would rack up more bucks according to traditional hollywood formula. The LOTR fllms are in a class by themselves , possibly the greatest cinematic achievement of film ever. Luckily, Peter Jackson had enough clout by then to reject the idea based on the grounds that the idea had leaked and millions of book fans had protested on the internet. What hasn't been said enough, and most people realize by now even though many other fans of other genre's(Matrix Revolutions, Star wars prequels) who refused acknowlegment of LOTR's gold standard among all films, is that these films are simply among the best ever filmed of all time, not to mention a truly faithful adaptation of the epitome and progenitor of fantasy literature and LOTR is considered literature even to the point there are Cliff's Notes(cheat notes for high school) for the LOTR books.",1102204800,11,1257,4.929245283018868

Peter Jackson far exceeded  my expectations.

I LOVE LORD OF THE RINGS!!!!!! And to all those so-called ""purists"" that like to knit pick the movie I have a few things to say: (1)Tom Bombadil sucked and I'm GLAD he's gone, (2) the 2 part set up of Two Towers in the book sucked and I'm glad Peter Jackson interlaced the 2 parts together for better effect, (3) Gollum looked very ""computer-y"" yes but I know you wouldn't prefer a little person in a rubber suit, and (4) I'm very happy about the massive amount of singing in the book by the hobbits that was eliminated from the film.

The only thing I agree with with the ""purists"" is in the scene with Saruman at the end that is missing in the film when he goes to the Shire at the end.  I'm praying with the rest of my fellow LOTR geeks that it will be in the extended edition.  I have to say that there are exactly TWO movies based on books that are better than the book, and the rest of them are the other way around.  The first is American Psycho.  The second, as much as I love the books, is Lord of the Rings. Jackson just did too good a job.  And out of the three, I believe Return of the King is the best and one of the greatest movies of all time.

Of course this is far more Tolkien's genius than Jackson's...in his focus on characters over plot and his obsessive/compulsive attention to detail, this is a masterpiece.  I thought the Matrix series would be this generations ""Star Wars"" at first.  I was WAAAY off.  ""Lord of the Rings"" takes that mantle and goes several feet beyond (and I'm an original ""Star Wars"" lover from hell...the FIRST 3 from the 70's/80's only of course and only the NON-SPECIAL EDITION versions.)

7274533,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I have seen comments where people are wondering where the full screen version of this movie is. Whether there is one or not of these 3 films, why would anyone watch anything but the Widescreen Version? The Widescreen version of this (or any other movie) is much better than the full screen versions. You get to see the entire picture as it was intended and as seen in the theater. Full screen is cutting out 1/3 to sometimes 1/2 of the full picture! Are the screens in the theater square as is your television? No, they are rectangular, as is the Widescreen version. Many people believe that the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen is cutting out the top and bottom of the picture. So untrue! Another term for Full Screen is ""Pan and Scan"". That means they take one scene and scan it from side to side so you can see what is going on, but only when the scene calls for a certain section of the full picture. Choose any movie you want and watch the full screen and widescreen versions and really look at them. View the top and bottom and sides of the full picture and you will see what you are truly missing. I tried to watch Fellowship in full screen on Starz once, and only once. I couldn't even get to the point past the fireworks at the party because there was so much of the full picture missing. It's a shame. Those of you that are die-hard Full Screen - Pan and Scan addicts, please give the Widescreen versions a try. If you watch them with an open mind and not freak out because of the black bars, you will have a much more enjoyable movie experience! That goes for almost any movie where you have the choice! If your argument is that your tv is too small - it's not an HD tv or something - the size of the tv isn't what is important - it's whether or not you are seeing the entire picture. I watched FOTR and TT on a 13 inch tv once in widescreen and I loved every minute of it! Granted my big living room tv is better, but even on a tiny tv, full screen just wouldn't cut it!

I want to tell those who have only seen the films - look beyond and explore the rest of the writings of J.R.R.

But these films (and ROTK in particular, since it omits much more than the others) are Peter Jackson's interpretation of Tolkein's books. If you believe that this film is SO lacking due to the missing storylines/climaxes that are present in the book, don't watch it! I would think that such avid readers (who love and appreciate the BOOKS as Tolkein's masterwork) would be intelligent enough to view the films as totally seperate entities from the books, and appreciate the FILMS as Peter Jackson's masterwork.",1101254400,11,648,4.954128440366972

There was only maybe 2 major changes that I saw. When I read the book I didn't have conflicting images in my head of what the actors looked like and what I saw the chars looked liked.

Although a true blue fan of the Tolkein books, I can understand the need to omit parts of the book when making a film.  In the first two films Jackson made up for that with wonderful character development.

It's always been my favorite fantasy book and I re-read it every few years.  I did think that the long ending didn't fit a movie very well, there were several points towards the end where the credits could have started rolling and it would have been OK... but it kept going.....just like this review.

7274552,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"How do I love this movie, let me count the ways! I wish I was a more articulate person so I could more adequately express the genius of this movie, but I'm not so here goes my best shot:

Two Towers was a bit of a let-down (not huge, but slightly) after the very moving Fellowship of the Rings. I heard through cast interviews that the third movie would be the best, but was skeptical at the scenes of what looked like basically a mideval battle with not much fantasy weaved in. But the movie took my breath away. It was so moving, so heart-pumping. Tolkien was a genius with character development, especially with Frodo heading toward demise but still struggling to maintain some sense of right and wrong. With Aragorn, the reluctant king realizing what he has to do by taking the throne, with the self-sacrifice of King Theoden, with the courage of Merry and Pippin, and of course, the unrelenting loyalty Sam showed by picking up his best friend and carrying him up the side of the mountain. Looking back, Sam had been probably the strongest character through the first two movies, but in the third he really broke through and stole the show and moved audiences to tears with his display of friendship.

Some say the movie carried on too far but it was not long enough in my opinion which is why I am so thrilled for the extended edition to come out. The last time I saw the movie was in April and I vowed not to watch it again until the extended version came out so as not to see it too much and take away some of the magic. So now I am obviously bursting with anticipation. It is my favorite movie and I'm pretty sure the extended edition will only make it better. I can't wait for December 14!

The Return of the King was a grand adventure! The acting, fx, and sound were just spectacular! The battles were well done. I can not say enough about how good a job Peter Jackson did.",1100822400,7,409,3.9156626506024095
7274555,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Peter Jackson's Epic (and I do mean Epic in every sense of the word) is brought to a close in this third installment of the series.  The movies closing is more then just an ending, it displays the changes that take place in the lives of these people who have fought so hard to save the world as they know it.

As in the two towers, this movie picks up where the last one left off.  And again, the pace moves swiftly.  Urgency is key, events are taking place that can destroy the human race.  The ring that must be destroyed is still in the hands of Frodo, who is constantly being manipulated by the insane Gollum, desperate and obsessed with reclaiming the ring.  His treacherousness is beyond compare.  It's very clear he is carefully plotting the demise of the two Hobbits he is guiding.  The movie offers more depth to his background as well, showing the reason why Frodo, seemingly against better judgment, attempts to appeal to his former personality.

The Human armies move again to the Palace city of Minas Tirith, where the final battle takes place.  Here the battle is led by Gandalph, highlighted by the skills of Aragorn and Legalos, as well as a huge army of humans and ghosts showing up at just the right time.

Return of the King takes a few more liberties with the original story but still does not disappoint.  The movie is technically splendid.  It's obvious that this movie could not have been done on the same scale until now, when the technology was up to date.  The entry of a ghost army and the creatures and orcs that make up the villain hordes are overwhelming but believable.

The ending is bittersweet, showing how some of these characters must go back to their previous existence, and finding it a strange feeling considering what they had been through.  Although a little long, it is faithful to the ending in the novel and makes sense considering the long journey we have taken with these characters.",1100822400,16,1929,4.580174927113703

7274557,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The extended DVD of ""Return of the King"" is filled with many new and extended scenes that will please fans who love Tolkien's original story.  The July 26, 2004 San Diego Comic Convention featured a preview of many scenes, some introduced by Peter Jackson himself.  (Some of these scenes were recently featured in the sneak preview trailer at Lord of the Rings.net, although now it seems to have been removed).  In reference to a couple of reviews on the board here -- if you're waiting anxiously for the Scouring of the Shire, don't hold your breath.  That segment was NEVER filmed by Jackson, therefore it will NOT be included in the extended edition DVD.  But there ARE plenty of great scenes to be included:

  We hear Christopher Lee's booming voice echoed over a dark screen that lightened to reveal Saruman on top of Orthanc. He warns our heroes of something festering in the heart of Middle-earth and that they will all die.

  We see Frodo and Sam in their Orc disguises joining the column of Orcs as they march out of Mordor.

  There are numerous shots of the Houses of Healing with Faramir, Eowyn, and Merry all seen.

  A lot more looks to be added to the siege of Minas Tirith, as there was a bunch of new battle footage.

  Frodo and Sam venture into the Crossroads and a few clips from that section were included.

  The Mouth of Sauron is featured pretty heavily. If you've played EA's Return of the King video game you'll recognize the scene. The Mouth of Sauron rides out of the Black Gate and presents Frodo's mithril coat to the Fellowship.

  Aragorn reveals himself to Sauron by approaching the Palantir in Minas Tirith and wields Anduril to show that the Heir of Elendil was alive.

  We get to see more of Saruman later in the preview when he knocks Wormtongue down and also fires a giant fireball from his staff that engulfs Gandalf on Shadowfax.

  There's more of Frodo and Sam in Mordor after they join the column of Orcs and before they discard their disguises. In one scene, Sam looks to the dark sky of Mordor and tells Frodo that he can see light as one little star can be seen glimmering through the clouds.

  And yes, we will finally get to see Gandalf facing down the Witch King. It happens exactly as we've seen, but when Gandalf holds up his staff the Witch King pulls out his sword and holds it to the sky where it spouts flames. As he brings it down, the air around the burning sword is distorted.

That was just the preview. New Line treated fans to three full clips, with the third introduced by Peter Jackson himself:

  There was a nice scene of Pippin and Faramir in Gondor where Faramir explains to the Hobbit how the small Gondorian armor he was wearing belonged to a young son of the Steward when he was a kid. Faramir further explains how Boromir was always the soldier and he wasn't.

  A scene that takes place about five days after they were healed by Aragorn features Faramir and Eowyn on a balcony at the Houses of Healing where Eowyn falls for Faramir.

  The Paths of the Dead is extended from where it ends in the theatrical cut. After Aragorn poses his offer, the dead laugh and go back into the walls. A massive earthquake starts, and the Three Hunters must escape an avalanche of millions of skulls.

  Described, but not shown, another scene expanded in this edition is the scene where Pippin finds Merry on the battlefield. Now, Pippin searches the field for an entire day after everyone else has gone back into the city. He finally locates Merry at night in the new version of the scene.

7274558,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"While it's too early to say that The Return of the King is the greatest film ever made, it would definitely be one of the great films to come out of Hollywood for a long time. It is undeniable that the Peter Jackson trilogy of Lord of the Rings is indeed groundbreaking in ambition and achievement that it is spawning copies from otherwise great directors (Troy, Alexander the Great...) which would probably not measure up to Jackson's work.

To his credit, Jackson succeeded in mostly avoiding the cliche and most of his scenes work beautifully and don't come off as fake. Some of the acting, however, does. But I probably notice this because I've seen the films countless times.

One strange thing for me is that a moving scene in the movie, one that has Aragorn crowned king of Gondor followed by the crowd bowing to the lowly hobbits, is oddly remisnicent of the Emperor of China, also followed by the crowd, bowing to a lowly subject who saves the kingdom in Disney's Mulan.

This extended edition, as in the extended editions of the previous installments, is for fans of the book and the movies for a couple of reasons. One, I can't see a casual viewer able to take hours and hours of trivia about the making of the movie. Second, some visual effects in the new and extended scenes are not as polished as those from the theatrical version, a flaw that is easily overlooked by adoring fans.

Nonetheless, the extended edition is a wonderful companion to the theatrical version, adding background info, clarifying an outcome and basically building a stronger connection to the Tolkien text.

Though I classify myself as one adoring fan, one thing I would complain about is the over-the-top commercialization that mines fans and audiences to their last cents. Releasing an extended edition is one thing, releasing ""official toys"", trading cards, Making-the-Gollum-statue DVD and the rest of the exclusive paraphernalia is quite another.",1100563200,7,1939,4.88145896656535

This will restore the fan faithful's respect and admiration for the achievement of Peter Jackson's telling of this wonderful story.

Regardless of this one dissapointment, the theatrical release version was a well told story packed into a 'brief' 3 1/2 hours ;-)

I just loved the return of the king. I am a true and very pleased fan with Peter Jackson's Trilogy, especially The Return of the king. The Plot is that The final battle for middle earth is about to begin and The battle takes place in the fields of the pelennor and The black gates of Mordor. This movie was a great experience, everything was just perfect as it was! Mostly nothing was wrong with it! The script was beautiful, The Lord of the rings trilogy was written by J.R.R Tolkein, a fantastic story writer and the script for the actual movie was supurb! It flowed so well with the sorroundings and it was easy to understand and comprehend and still get the emotion with it. The battle scenes were THE BEST! I just loved every minute of it. The special effects were so real and so exciting! So action packed ( though sometimes it can go allitle far but we still enjoy it....). I have been a Enormous fan for The score music for the return of the king and the music fitted so well, there was a mixture of slow but beautiful and heroic and energetic which, with the film made your back tingle in happiness :).

The acting was what made the film connect with so many people. It was realistic, not corny. Their eyes, their facial expression, I could feel their emotion, therefore, I cried like a baby 4 times and other people cried too in the cinema. When I was in the theaters, people were so engaged with the film, they started to Cheer. Some people would think this would be annoying BUT! bevause we now it is so good.. why not join them???

Emotion, music acting and realism, story are the key things that all directors should take account for... The return of the king has done all of this and this is ultimatly one of the most perfect epic films ever made. I just loved this film. fabulous.

THE EXTENDED EDITION IS A MUST HAVE! SO MANY FEATURES = SO MANY HOURS OF LORD OF THE RINGS FUN! ARGH!!!! THIS IS SO GREAT! Ive read the book ( oike many other fans) and I based on many previews and deleted scenes from the book, you can tell that this is gonna be great man!)There are many things that P.J left out in Return of the king and waiting for the extended edition is something I cannot wait sitting still.

Overall, I have said it before, FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The battle scenes and the special effects were great to say the least and even that is an enormous understatement. What was best about this movie was the almost overpowering emotions that came across such as courage, sacrifice and friendship. No one who watches this movie will come away untouched by it. Especially if you are a Tolkien fan then you know what I mean.

If you are trying to decide between the extended versions versus the theatrical release versions, let me offer you this advice:

1.  Get a very comfortable couch or lounger.

2.  Get a really large bowl of popcorn and a large container of your favorite beverage.

3.  Pay the extra money and get the Extended Versions of all three movies.

I used to read the Trilogy every summer as a camp counselor (with no TV to watch it was a great way to fall asleep after a long day).  While I thoroughly enjoyed the theatrical releases, I always felt a bit, well, cheated.  There were so many scenes I thought crucial to the storyline that just had to be cut from the theatrical release to make it more time palatable.  However, I was greatly encouraged to see the extended versions picking up so many of these ""key"" scenes. I can hardly wait to see what the extra 50 minutes will include.  I felt that the final installment of the Trilogy unncessarily truncated (look it up) and felt that the Shire deserved a better ""wrap up"".  Also the extended version will also help shed light on the final character dispositions.

If you don't own any of the extended versions, get them now.  You won't be disappointed!",1100044800,13,1354,4.533057851239669

One thing Peter Jackson does is when he makes a Special Edition DVD he goes all out and that's what has me so excited about this movie.

50 minutes of footage will be added to the movie. I can tell you from my experience with the first two special editions is that the footage will be great. It always adds more to the movie and explains a little more of Tolkiens books. It will make the movie four hours long, but who cares. It will be some of the best four hours of your cinematic life everytime you watch it.

The Howard Shore score also has me excited. This guy is an excellent composer. He is no John Williams or James Horner, but he is quickly apporaching there status.

I love the extras that Jackson puts with these Special Editions. The first two had over four hours of extras talking about the movies and there makings and it's incredible how these were put together. I look forward to watching all the Appendices on Return of the King and seeing how one of the greatest special effect movies ever made was made.

The interviews with all the actors are always great on these DVDs. These guys became these characters and like family to each other. It's great hearing there stories and the love that they had for each other and for the project.

For the Tolkien purists out there who seem to get a thrill out of carping about how Peter Jackson didn't do this, that or the other thing, take a deep breath and relax. Jackson filmed the movies so that they would appeal to a wide audience and not just to Tolkien enthusiasts. The movies turned on a whole new generation to Tolkien's works. I had never read LOTR until after seeing Fellowship in the theaters. After seeing the film, I bought the books and tore through them in a few weeks. I doubt I am the only one who had this experience.

Yes there is stuff I wish Jackson had included in the films. But that doesn't mean his adaptation of the books is an insult to Tolkien's writing abilities or storytelling genius.

If the Tolkien purists hate Jackson's version so much, then why not take up a collection and make your own LOTR films?

As for me, I will gladly fork over money to see this extended version of the film. And I will say a little prayer every night before going to bed that Jackson brings The Hobbit to the big screen and then does a film on all that happens in the Appendicies of ROTK.",1099440000,23,1194,4.293333333333333
7274576,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The movie series directed by Peter Jackson adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien's story ""The Lord Of The Rings"" is indeed an excellent one.

  To address some points of earlier reviewers, essential information and details of the book were left out of the films because they were essential to the book, not the film.  Remember that this is a Hollywood adaptation.  New Line Cinema still had to make money on this film and to produce it meant cutting a great deal of material from the original story.  I forgive Peter Jackson in that regard.

  While Elijah wood had not read the complete story of the LOTR before performing in it on camera, he did have excellent coaching on how to perform the role of Frodo.  With the likes of Rhys-Davies, McKellen and Holm there to help him, Mr. Wood did quite an excellent job.

  One must understand about what Tolkien wrote.  He was a man fascinated by languages, histories, mythologies and folklore and that is what he wrote about.  The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings, were just small stories or tales that took place in a fictional place for which he created an entire history and legend.  The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings are indeed just the tip of the iceberg.  Without these small stories, Tolkien's history would be limited to his childrens' bookshelves.  These stories helped bring to life a world of infinite wonder and creativity.  Likewise, without adapting the movies to fit the parameters of an epic motion picture, it would not sell, and it would not accomplish anything.

  I did not read any of Tolkien's work before I saw the first two installments of the LOTR.  It speaks volumes about the exceptional job of Peter Jackson and his crew that I saw his films and proceeded to not just read this story in its original form, but swim deep into the ocean that is Tolkien's work.  No matter how many times I read the LOTR, I will always envision in my mind Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Elrond and all the other characters as they were portrayed on screen by this excellent group of talented actors.

  I own the Extended Editions of the first two films and recommend them highly.  The added scenes do not drag the movie down or add meaningless menousia like some other movies do when extended versions are relesed.  Also, the commentaries are very nice to listen to.  You can learn a lot about the movies and filmaking by listening to them.  I especially like the design team commentary, their input is very helpful for a Tolkien fan.  While I highly recommend the movies, particularly in this special extended edition, I recommend the books, one hundred times moreover.",1099353600,,2608,4.663736263736264

I saw the second one in the theatres, in was boiling hot, my Uncle was snorting continuously, the chairs were uncomfortable and the movie was just good enough, but not great enough to beat all the other unpleasentaries surrounding me. So, I come into this movie thinking it will just be like the rest of them, man, was I wrong. This is by far the best of three and the only one I would praise out of this trilogy. The ending is sad, yet happy and The WitchKing is the best bad guy yet. Plus, he can't help but love good old Gandolf. He makes his appearences in this movie much more notable then the first two, and even Frodo managed to get on my good side. This movie is terrific and if I were to go back and watch the first two now, I think it would be much more delightful and interesting. It's just a shame that they couldn't have made the first one like this because then I would have been fascinated from the beginning... and this is a great series to get in to because they have so much from this series. Overall, it's packed with excitement, good acting and a strong plot that builds throughout the trilogy. There is nothing more that I liked about this trilogy then the plot, the acting was always shaky in the first two, but they pull out of shaky and go to great in this one.

The whole move was played out on a large scale. The sheer hopelessness of the mission had you on the edge of your seat the whole time. You would say to yourself..""that's it, they are all going to die, they are not going to make it out of this one,"" then some twist of events would give you hope again.

7274584,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I was a big fan of Lord of The Rings back when more than half of the fans today didn't really know about this 3 years ago. I bought the first and second DVD and couldn't wait to see the third and final movie. This truly is one of the greatest trilogies ever made, and believe me, if you like action and adventure, with romance and powerful performances mixed in, then you will like this.

Where to begin? The movie is the longest one of the three, about 3 hours and 20 minutes, and even though I got a little restless the last half hour in the theatre, I really liked it.

Viggo Mortenson is one of the best as Aragorn, the heir to the throne of the kingdom of men. He and Gandalf the white, lead their friends in a desperate fight against an army of 600,000 orks or more. While I enjoyed the action sequences as much as anyone else, it was the scenery that got my attention.

I am truly amazed at how beautiful New Zealand is, and I loved the scene where the signal torches were lit to warn of the beginning of the war. It was great to the see the mountains and the fog mix together. I loved the idea of showing us the torches like that, very beautiful.

Meanwhile the two Hobbits, Sam and Frodo, and their evil guide Gollum, are trying to find a new way into Mordor, the land where the evil lord Sauron lives in. I was pretty impressed by the City of the Dead, but when the shriek appeared as the king of the Ringwraiths flew into view, it was a little too loud for me in the audience. I also noticed some kids crying as the movie continued.

As the two armies prepare to march into battle, Gandalf manages to show us again what he can do, despite the fact that his beard is about 6 feet long, yet he does manage to save several men as they try to escape flying dragon-like creatures.

Also when the son of the former king of men, who wasn't technically the king, decides to show his father he can actually be as good as a son as the king doesn't think he is leads a suicide attack on ork controlled territory was a moving scene. One of the other hobbits sang a song as the men rode into battle. Very moving to see what the son would try to do to impress his father.

Now as for the action scenes go, I think if you saw Troy, then you will know what the battle scenes were like, although these are 10 times better. Kind of like Braveheart at the beginning but again, much better. Aeowyn, the niece of the king of Rohan, another kingdom of men, tries to fight but is told she cant because she is a woman, but before you blow your top let me just say she also is the one who kills the big bad dude of the Ringwraiths with the great line, ""I am no man!"" [Hint: the bad guy said no man could kill him]

Now for the ending, it was like it could end at several different places, as the screen went dark multiple times. Once when Frodo and Sam are on a a rock surrounded by lava, and again when all the members of the fellowship reunite.

And lets not forget the great scene where everyone bows down to the hobbits at the end of the book. Remember, there were several hard times when the Hobbits managed to pull through and keep hope alive. A very moving scene and the hobbits deserved it in my opinion.

The second disk doesn't have a lot of extras which is a real surprise. However it does have the great segment from the Director, Peter Jackson's point of view. I also liked how several of the settings or characters were given sort segments that explained in more detail what they were, even though some of them are only a few minutes long.

It also has a National Geographic Special, which shows us the making of the lord of the rings as well. and it even comes with the making of the several series of the lord of the rings game for playstation and x box. I own one myself, its pretty fun to watch.

Now even though the extras are okay, it is the stories themselves that will become classics. This is truly a great film and should be viewed by anyone who has read any of the books, although the movies don't follow the books exactly!",1098316800,5,4034,4.157692307692308
7274585,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"As usual, the scenery was gorgeous, esp. the mountainous areas, but the characters were shallow and much of the acting was either mediocre or hollow.  The film was still was also very male-dominated.

It was mostly hyped-up, medieval battle after battle with the same tripe on horses and bows and arrows in this film that advertised itself as a fantasy film. But there is really little fantasy or magic at all and the plot is shallow and lacks the depth and emotion that the Harry Potter films have.

The closer Frodo gets to Mordor, the more he becomes a complete dodo, esp. over the ring.  I had to laugh out loud when Frodo keeps Sam from getting on Gullom, who is after the ring.

Sam is one character who improved over the first two films; the actor did a better job this time around with Sam and Sam showed some promise here; after Frodo hurts his feelings so nastily and acts stupid, Sam courageously comes to Frodo's rescue when Gullom tricks Frodo into a trap.

Throughout the film, Sam also tries to warn Frodo that Gullom is up to no good and is trying to deceive both of them, but Frodo, who is also exploiting Gullom, just coolly brushes Sam's fears off. Frodo was also very insensitive and showed a lack of loyalty in allowing Gullom to mock Sam and badmouth him.

I felt so sorry for poor Sam when Frodo turns on him and sends Sam away in tears and it's revealed that Frodo has just been using Sam all along.  Frodo should be thanking his lucky stars that he has Sam for a friend; few friends would come to aid the way Sam did. I get the feeling Frodo doesn't fully appreciate Sam's friendship.

Gullom was funny in many parts; his self-mumblings made me laugh; other times, he was downright mean, esp. to Sam and I'd have been irritated enough to tell him to get lost.  Gullom is the brains of the threesome and knows that Frodo is using him and resents it, but realized that Frodo isn't too bright, so he devises his trap after Frodo falls for his lies about Sam.  In that way, Gullom uses Frodo and Sam, although Frodo is too dull to realize it.

I also laughed at some of the scenes with Gandalf, Merry, and Pippin; poor Pippin rather naively looked thru Gandalf's ball and gets into trouble with Gandalf, who, despite his ""wizardly"" demeaner of being a ""gentle"" old man, really doesn't have much patience with the hobbits and isn't as deep or caring as Hogwart's Dumbledore is.

If anything, I watched this one for a lot of laughs and spoof ideas, despite the film's attempt at being a serious war film.  It's good fodder for comedians and spoofs.",1098316800,2,2567,4.457264957264957

Profundity is not the province of cgi geeks, though, is it?",1098316800,27,541,4.587628865979381
7274587,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The Return Of The King is the final part to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It perfectly completes the trilogy of which the three films rank amongst the finest achievements in film history. The film follows Frodo (Elijah Wood) and his trusty companion Sam (Sean Astin) through their ascent of Mount Doom to destroy the ring. Meanwhile their friends face a final battle against Sauron's forces to defend Minas Tirith. Aragon (Viggo Mortensen) must face his true calling as the King of men and Legalos (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are by his side to fight the Orc forces. The battle scene is a visual masterpiece worthy of true epic stature. Andy Serkis who brilliantly voices the creature Gollum gets some real face time in the beginning of the film as we see the origins of Gollum. Ian McKellan is the films steady presence as Gandlaf and Liv Tyler and Miranda Otto bring beauty and strength to their roles of Arwen & Eowyn respectively. The film has so many intricacies and brilliant performances that they are impossible to detail. Behind all the amazing performances is the best performance of them all, director Peter Jackson's. Mr. Jackson's work is as good as any director's work in history and when you take all three films as a whole, it probably is the greatest work any director has ever achieved. The Return of the Kings was a big success Oscar night, sweeping all eleven categories it was nominated in including Best Picture and Director and tied Ben-Hur & Titanic for most Oscars for one film. With the six awards the first two installments received, it is far and away the most honored film franchise in history.  The first two extended editions were tremendous and I have no doubt that the final extended edition will be their equal.",1098316800,11,1763,4.761437908496732
7274588,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Peter Jackson proved me wrong when I said, like many people, that Lord of the Rings would be a bust: Spielberg-adventure at best, Lucas-disaster at worst. Had I known Tolkien's classic was in the hands of the guy who directed Heavenly Creatures, I would have been more optimistic. As it turns out, my expectations were completely overturned. In some ways the films are actually better than the books, especially in terms of emotional power. Competent actors, amazing cinematography, and a brilliant music score combine to offer us Middle-Earth as we'd never imagined it.

Fellowship of the Ring is the most polished film, with its elegant episodic pacing. We start in the idyllic world of the hobbits and flee with Ringwraiths hot on our heels; we rest in Elrond's sanctuary and plunge into Moria; we come out grieving and console ourselves in Galadriel's safe (yet unsettling) dream-wood, and then wind up surrounded by Uruk-hai. This is a quintessential fantasy road-journey containing three episodes within an episode, each beginning in a haven and followed by a dark journey. The pacing is flawless, and the plot unfolds to a perfect beat.

Two Towers is the ambiguous film. It's excellent (or at least the extended version is) but structured in a way that the hobbits become sidelined by the Rohan story. As they are the soul of Tolkien's epic, we feel slightly nonplussed at their consignment to B-storylines. Ironically, the film is a showcase for cgi characters Gollum and Treebeard, who manage to steal the show from within these storylines.

Return of the King is the most dramatic film, tragic on almost a biblical level, and certainly the most satisfying. I can understand why Elijah Wood calls it ""better than one and two combined"". It centers on the hopeless mission to Mount Doom, which, as every fan knows, is the heart of the story. Around this we're bombarded by apocalyptic chaos and destruction on the Pelennor Fields, followed by Aragorn's hopeless march on the Black Gate. We finish at the Grey Havens, the best ending in literary and cinematic history, which encapsulates all of Tolkien's themes: courage, friendship, suffering, and passing on. It just doesn't get better than this.

Peter Jackson deserves more accolades than I'm capable of heaping to the point of overkill. Minor quibbles aside, the extended versions of these films are masterpieces to be treasured as much as the books. Tolkien's classic may be pure, but the movie's cinematography takes us where even the written word cannot go. Tolkien's writing is irreplaceable, but Howard Shore's music taps deeper into Middle-Earth's soul. The text is sacred, but the scriptwriters changed it anyway so that it could actually work on screen. The entire project has been too good to be true, and I'm still in awe of it.",1098230400,525,2800,5.01505376344086
7274589,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I've been reading Tolkien's books since I was a little GIRL of 10 or 11 and wanting there to be movies since I first read the Hobbit. I personally think the movies are great. While I was disapointed in not seeing Bombadil and the final ending being different, I wasn't so dissapointed in it that it affected how much I loved the movies. I thought the final was great, the parts of the movie that I had always had the most trouble visualizing (the battles) I now have visuals for, and the parts that I didn't (the scenery and cities), was confirmed. Jackson did a great job following Tolken's descriptions. As for ""Eman"" (is that a change of He-Man? everyone who has seen those cartoons should have no doubt of the, um, orientation, of that character)the only thing I will say is, obviously he didn't have the intelegence to read the books.

7274590,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"After  being a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings books for the last 10 years (keeping in mind that I am only 20), these movies have continued my love for both Tolkein and Peter Jackson (if anyone out there has not seen the Frighteners, Heavenly Creatures or Dead Alive, I would highly recommend them). Maybe it is just pride for my country, being a kiwi myself, or a love for cinema, but seeing these films in the cinema completely blew me away, and each year left me waiting with baited breath for the next. Unfortunately, the trilogy has ended, but we still have the extended DVD to look forward to, and if the two previous ones are anything to go by (and I firmly believe that they are), this one will be even better.

Now, onto the unfortunate topic of EMAN, after reading the reviews on the first page, I was unable to understand the fuss that everyone was making, so I sought out his review.

Shocking though it may be to you, not all LOTR fans are male, and not all of us only watch it for the gorgeous men (though they are wonderful, and they can act).  Did it ever occur to you that in an epic adventure of this sort, there is not much room for romance and women, but they do play a role in all that is happening. It is todays society that prevents men from forming the close, loving friendships that women are renowned for. Why go on about masculinity? Why not just accept these relationships for what they are?

In an entire list of reviews, almost all have given glowing comments, in my opinion, EMAN just wanted to create some controversy. Maybe his life is so small that he has to get his childish kicks somehow, and this is one of those ways. Perhaps he reads all of this, and the reaction from everyone else makes him feel needed. How about we all just let this poor, lonely man alone, and stop giving him what he craves, the attention of total strangers over the internet.

LOTR1 and LOTR2 both have the same release system and after every cinema release it was been announced very clearly that they would first release a theatrical version and then later an extended edition and a limited edition with some gadgets. This is really no news under the sun.

However, I considered the ending of LOTR3 just boring. Whereas Tolkien managed to keep his book interesting, the movie really should end after the scene in which Sam and Frodo are rescued by the birds. From that moment on, the movie is nothing but an everlasting serie of happy endings, one more boring and predictable than the other.

I really hope that the extra 50 minutes put a few twists in the series of endings but I am not really expecting this. I will nevertheless buy the EE (and I also rate LOTR3 with 5 stars) because the title deserves it.

But the way they are marketing them is not. If Jackson really cared about less than money, would he release the ""Special"" Editions, only to have previews for the ""Platinum Extended"" versions on the Special Editions?!

It's like saying, ""Thanks for buying this movie, and here's a preview of the real good edition that you were too stupid to wait around for.""

I knew about the extended editions ahead of time so I waited. I know many people who DIDN'T. They ended up paying $20, then another $30 at retail price -- $50 just for one movie that is re-released!

Sure, lots of movies are re-released (T2, Total Recall, Dirty Dancing, Showgirls, etc.) but usually it's after a lengthy period of times, and it updates the content in a very good way.

Lord of the Rings Extended Edition DVDs come out mere months after the ""Special"" Editions -- for TT and FotR it was from August to late November!

I don't know, I just think that they shouldn't have released ""Special"" Editions -- instead of wasting minimum amount of time on the (crappy) Special Editions why not just invest that time into the Extended Editions and stop trying to rip consumers off?

7274605,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"RETURN OF THE KING finishes the stunning trilogy of Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS. In this tale, Frodo & Sam continue on to foreboding Mordor while the rest of the Fellowship fights the massive armies being sent out by Sauron, the dark lord.
From the movie, it would appear Jackson & creative team take some liberties with Denethor (i.e. he was controversial and stuffy but in the movie he's just an idiot), as well as leaving out the Scouring of the Shire (i.e. not enough time and anti-climatic, they say in the extended DVD of Fellowship) and what is happening over the rest of Middle Earth (i.e. in the trilogy the other areas of good are under attack, so, it's not like the other elves, dwarves and humans are sitting back).

The final film has the usual elements we have grown to love:

(1) snappy, funny replies from Gimli;
(2) the usual competitive streak between Gimli and Legolas, which includes one part where Legolas drops an elephant and Gimli says, ""That only counts as one!""
(3) Sam being the heart of the film. In fact, he steals some of the best lines. Look for one of my favorites in the orc tower as he says, ""And that's for me old gaffer!"";
(4) Pippin getting into trouble;
(5) even more epic scope battles than in TWO TOWERS (yes, even with the extended version);
(6) Aragorn using his leadership to create strengh in the ranks of men . .. Gandalf helps a lot, too;
(7) Gandalf using his powers to ward off evil, including the Nazgul (i.e. the flying dragons);
(8) lots and lots of evil things;
(9) a chance to finally see Mordor and the evil which rests within, including the creepy, slimy and chilling Shelob, a giant spider that looks too real;
(10) the final erosion of Gollum's mental abilities, including a flashback to how he found the ring and slew his brother for it;
(11) a stand off between Eowyn and the Witch King;
(12) The charge of Rohan in Gondor, where they decimate orc ranks but then have to deal with massive elephant legions;
(13) the lighting of the fires, which goes off all over Middle Earth, it seems, to call Gondor's allies to aid, as waves of orcs and other baddies arrive.; and
(14) The bittersweet ending and the sailing of the last White Ship, which includes Frodo, who realizes that the ring has taken its toll on his personage and that he can't go back home again. He is emotionally scarred and after four years in the Shire he leaves on the White Ship with Gandalf, Elrond & Galadriel.

The talk around Hollywood is that this film will not only be nominated for best film with the Academys but will also win. Golden Globes has given it several awards already, too.

For those who have gotten nostalgiac that the series has ended, cheer up. Peter Jackson has expressed a keen interest in doing THE HOBBIT. That said, with all the money Hollywood made, I'm feeling they're going to try and also do something with THE SILMARALLION, assuming the Tolkien estate doesn't put up a huge fight, that is.

Overall, a great epic conclusion to the trilogy. Look to the DVD to fill in rushed or missing slots.

Purists of the novels will have their gripes; everyone else will love it.",1097193600,35,3124,4.530141843971631
7274606,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Alas, all good things must come to an end, and on December 14, the last milestone in a four-year-long (or decade-long, depending on who you ask) odyssey will be passed.  The release of the extended edition of ROTK is arguably the most anticipated DVD event of the whole year, and with good reason.  I'm assuming that everyone who is interested this early has read about the extra goodies we can expect from Jackson and Co.  Things like the Mouth of Sauron, the orc-march with Sam and Frodo, and (my personal favorite) the blossoming relationship between Eowyn and Faramir, not to mention a whole host of others.  I guess the Extended Editions prove the exception to the rule that less is more.  50 extra minutes is a long time, even compared with the original hefty running time of 3 1/2 hours.  I'm heartily anticipating the numbing my rear is going to receive.

When you think about it, The Lord of the Rings should never have happened.  At least, not in this day and age.  We're talking about an unknown director, with no previous experience in epic filmaking, a special effects workhouse in *New Zealand*, of all places, and a smallish production company that really couldn't afford to make a gamble of this magnitude and expect to recover if they lost.  Still, Jackson certainly made sure they got their money's worth, even before the movies became hits.  He made three movies, each over 3 hours long, with copious special effects and a huge cast, for $300 million.  Titanic, a single movie, while admittedly a very ambitious one, had a price tag of about $400 million.  I have no idea how Jackson did it, and I don't need to know.  Even if he never makes another movie as good as LOTR (God forbid!), he will go down in filmaking history as the man who was able to translate an untranslateable classic to the big screen, and still do it justice.  How many ""serious"" directors can claim that feat, even with less ambitious books?

Now, for those who claim LOTR is a lesson for our time, you may very well be right.  Then again, you might not.  Either way, it really doesn't matter.  We all see what we want to see, but I think I'll trust the author's view in this case.  Tolkien was famously contemptuous of allegory, and the least we can do for him is to honor his request that the books (and the movies) be read and seen for themselves, without bringing our own prejudices and justifications into it, at least not on purpose.

So, here's to the final leg of the journey.  The most awe-inspiring visual representation that will ever be seen of one of the world's greatest books will be complete in just over two months.  Mark your calenders, folks!  I myself plan to be first in line at the video store that day...",1097107200,72,2719,4.558762886597938
7274607,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of ""Lord of the Rings"" reaches its pinnacle in ""Return of the King."" The stellar cast, mind-blowing special effects and heartbreaking script are all present in the third movie, which is not only the last of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, but the best.

Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still following the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the path to Mordor, with the increasingly strained Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realizes his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel...

Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. \Not only is the city under siege, but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his one remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the dead won't help him if Frodo doesn't destroy the Ring...

The ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess.

Peter Jackson really outdoes himself. You know those battle scenes in ""Two Towers"" and ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" with the swooping camera and thousands of orcs, clashing with men on a gloomy battlefield? In ""Return of the King,"" Jackson surpasses that. There's everything from volcanic eruptions to an invasion of howling ghosts to the attack of the oliphaunts (like elephants, only bigger). Each action scene a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't.

But if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. They cry, they hug, they think about home -- such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into equally rich movie dialogue.

Elijah Wood gives an unparalleled performance as Frodo Baggins. Frodo's gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the ""strong"" hobbit, rather than the follower. The final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated.

But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, and the ""I'm going to take care of you"" scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Mortensen gets more kingly every moment, while Ian McKellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom. Bernard Hill has a quietly moving final scene, while Miranda Otto makes the despairing Eowyn a strong, kick-butt heroine.

Perhaps the most striking thing about ""Return of the King"" is the final fourth of the film. While the ""multiple endings"" may annoy some viewers, it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden, splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending, Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron.

""Return of the King"" brings the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy to a close, and cements Jackson's reputation as a master filmmaker. With the outstanding cast, beautiful scripting and amazing direction, this is the best of the ""Lord"" films -- and that's saying something.",1096934400,55,4301,5.021037868162693
7274608,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"It seemed almost like a tradition each Holiday break to go and see the Lord of the Rings movies in theatres. Now that the trilogy is over with, Peter Jackson definitely needs to direct the re-make of the Hobbit.

  The Return of the King, in my opinion was the best. Unlike the first two, the movie was not drawn together by broad lengthed battle scenes. I also liked how this movie actually contain all the elements a good movie would, comedy (the laughing in bed scene, or the Sam and Frodo posse, and even Gandalf-pure comic relief), romance (though somehow not deep romance, but its there),characters overcoming their obstacles to mature their position, a plot that was straightforward and not cut out, random people with problems, drawn out death scenes, and trying to build from the novel with the creativity of the director. Though there were plenty of scenes missing from the book.

  So in this version I hope it includes the Battle of Baywater (or when the Hobbits get home, and see it taken over by ruffians and Saruman), or the scene where Aragorn rescues injured patients with a magical herb. But I'll have to see how it goes.",1096848000,15,1139,4.67
7274609,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"First of all, this movie is based on a book.  It is not THE book.  Comparisons between the two may hold some value but the movie should not be based solely on them.  Everyone has an idea of what should be or shouldn't be in this movie and yet, did you make the movie?  No.  This was Jackson's love and his task.  Very few, if any, would dare to take on the job of making this movie or the first two for that matter.  So, thank you Peter Jackson for bringing these books to the screen.

Another thing is, we are all rating an item that none of us have seen yet.  But, if it has the same result as the first two extended editions, this release will be superb.  The scenes that are to be added back in, should add alot to the film for fans.

The Return Of The King was an excellent movie, especially if you never read the book.  But even for those of us that have, if you can remember that cinema and novels differ in many ways, you should be able to enjoy the film.

The one thing that really comes across in this movie is this.  No matter who you are, how big or small you are, or where you are from or where you are going, you CAN make a difference.  It also reinforces the thought that good, in the end, will always defeat evil.

One other thought, and that has to do with the ending, or ENDINGS, as some of you feel.  The Lord of the Rings is one big 9+ hour movie.  Where does the beginning end and the middle start?  For me, it is at the meeting at the house of Elrond where the fellowship is formed.  Some might feel that it is when Frodo and Sam leave the Shire.  I won't disagree with those of you who feel that way.

Something to consider, the meeting at the house of Elrond is some hour and 25 minutes into The Fellowship of the Ring.  When Frodo and Sam leave the Shire, is some 35 minutes into the film.  And yet, Peter Jackson was to wrap up a 9+ hour movie in five or ten minutes.  It doesn't make any sense to me.  How can you wrap up a 9+ hour movie with just a thought, or an afterthought.  For most of the trilogy, the one thought was to destroy the ring.  In the end, you not only see the ring destroyed, you see the hobbits back home, with life moving on, except for Frodo.  You get to see peace again in Middle Earth.  It needed to be that long to end it properly.  That is my thought on the ending.

No matter what, give this extended cut a try.  You may like it, you may hate it, but judge it for yourself, and keep an open mind.",1096848000,36,2451,3.9671457905544147
7274610,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"I have read many reviews criticizing Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Lord of the Rings on the basis of this was left out of the book, and this was left out, etc. I'm not a purist, and any intellegent person will have to acknowledge there is no way to get the entirety, precision and beauty of the entire book onscreen. Jackson deserves praise and applause on this account, that he did a stupendous job, particularly with Fellowship.

Return of the King however lacks not only the details, but the spirit of Tolkein's work. It is one thing to alter something for the sake of cinematic adaptation, but it is quite another to change things that bring no cinematic value to the picture, and in fact take away from the story, such as the expansion of Arwen's character into a role that is non-existant in the book. Particularly devistating is the scene where Frodo tells Sam to leave. This is a dramatic departure from the story, which provides no cinematic value. Frodo would NEVER send Sam away, and Sam would never leave! I cringe whenever the part comes up.

The battle scenes are also too long, without enough substance, and the Elephants are strangely remeniscient of the walkers in Empire Strikes back. (It should be also noted that George Lucas was on the set giving advice to Jackson. Considering the fate of Star Wars, it is no suprise to see a lessening quality in Return of the King). In addition, the way Tolkein had it written in the book was far better, and easily adaptable to cinema. Instead Jackson cut the knights of Dol Amroth, who leave the gates of Minas Tirith as soon as Rohan comes to join the battle, as well as the battles with the armies of Haradrim on foot. He departs from the fact that no enemy ever set foot in Minas Tirith except the Witchking, and cut a dramatically stunning face-off between Gandalf and the Witchking, which is interupted by Rohan's coming. Instead this was replaced with endless fighting within Gondor's gates which just gets boring. All of these things rather than enhancing cinematic value, took away from the story, producing long battle scenes with little plot, drama or substance, other than the fact that the good guys will eventually win somehow.

Thus as a whole, the cinematic quality of the movie was low, in comparison with the Fellowship which is stupendous. Yet the whole substance wasn't lost, thus I give 2 stars.",1096848000,46,2378,4.697841726618705

There are several climax points in the book, and for anyone who wanted to get this right, they really needed to spend more time with each individual character climax, instead of an overall climax.  Many partings became too many partings.  Vigo Mortensen hums a short verse to something Jackson threw together 5 minutes before production.  It really needed more time in the oven...

7274615,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Though it is totally coincidental that these films were produced during the past 3 years,  they have provided an interesting parallel of events and mood of the world populace..

It's written many times that J.R.R. Tolkien did not intend any allegory or analogy to be made between his books and real life.  But, I see real comparisons to current events with those within the story.

Try now to decide whether I'm illustrating 'the real' or 'the written'...

A power (in the East) which had been reduce some time ago (by allied forces) rises again.  The victors of the previous conflict are now divided, and some refuse to assist and even provide aid to the enemy.  Except for the people of the westernmost land (in this earth) and several 'more eastern' lands of people (with English accents), the only other 'race' to see the danger is that of a 'northeastern' group (usually living a cold, industrialized existence).  Though most of the people of the 'westernmost land' are under the belief that they shouldn't get involved with the troubles of the 'outside world', and foolishly state 'keep your nose out of trouble, and no trouble will come to you', some realize that no one is safe in the end, and that evil spreads to every far land in time.  They send a contingent representing their peoples into the land to once again destroy the evil (first thru mountainous areas, then thru a vast wasteland),  experience battles and loss along the way.

I can't continue, since the ""real world's"" conflict is not yet over (especially the part where I am crowned king, and get a nice wifey...).  Though the 'two towers' have already been destroyed (coincidentally, the foundation remains intact),  I'm hoping that the exclusion of the 'scouring of the shire' is also reflected in the 'real world'.  The lesson that there is always 'an enemy within' ready to ruin our world was not shown,  but can be seen everyday (even within this discussion list).

But, the most important similarity between the films, and current events, is the loss of our 'once great' ideals,  and willingness to protect our land and freedoms (I'm not referring to recent laws which supposedly take away freedom, but only the criminals are complaining), and above all, the willingness to sacrifice one's own comfort, or even one's own life to protect this land and life of freedom for others....  For me, the most emotional parts of the film, are those where the characters show their resign to carry on, though wavering at times, and face incredible odds and torment to get the job done...

The people who had those virtues are now all but gone (the blood of Numenor is all but lost),  and what we're left with are hollow creatures who see only as far as themselves, and are ripe for destruction...

7274616,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I am absolutely thrilled that The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King Extended Edition will be released soon.  I've noticed that some of the other reviewers have been complaining about various ""shortcomings"" of the intended release.  I am not one of those malcontents.  This entire trilogy of films has been a godsend to the millions of fans of J.R.R. Tolkien.  Peter Jackson has been true to the spirit of the books, and he has poured himself into creating a masterpiece of an epic story for the screen (he and hundreds of others, that is).

Both my wife and I have tremendously enjoyed viewing each of the Extended Editions as they've become available.  It's almost like eating a favorite meal and finding that an even better spice or other ingredient has been added to improve the overall experience.  Each Extended Edition has added more backstory details and enriched the already fabulous tapestry that has been created in the films.

As for all the hoopla about the Scouring of the Shire not being in the Extended Edition, some people need to understand that Peter Jackson was restricted by a budget within which he had to produce all three movies (remember, folks, that all three films were made at the same time, so he couldn't ask for more money on the basis of the first film's success).  Therefore, he (and the writers) had to make some decisions about what to leave out.  The Scouring of the Shire IS an important element, but it does not diminish the characters of the hobbits because it is missing from the film.  They still proved that, in the end, everything depended upon the little people--the powerful leaders certainly had major roles to play, but it was the small folk who ultimately overcame.  Anyone who sees the movie should arrive at that conclusion.

I applaud Mr. Jackson and the rest of the talented individuals who labored to produce this magical masterpiece.  Know that it will have a place of pride in my DVD collection alongside all the other original releases and extended editions that already reside there.  Now, Peter Jackson, let's get busy on The Hobbit!!  :)",1096761600,18,2099,4.772853185595568
7274617,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"P. Runyan is absolutely correct that this chapter is the real climax of the novels:  the whole point of LOTR is that it's fundamentally a story told by and through the eyes of the Hobbits (identified with Tolkien's English countrymen but really symbolizing the average person everywhere).  It's all well and good that the great heroes of the world -- Gandalf, Aragorn, Elrond -- can win mighty battles; but the important thing is that the real heroes are the common folk... Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry, and in the Hobbit, Bilbo.  Tolkien understood that the real victory is that the Hobbits learn that their destiny is in their own hands, which the Scouring of the Shire chapter makes crystal clear.

Alas, P. Runyan (and I) are destined for disappointment, as Peter Jackson stated in an interview that he did not even film that section.  It seems that he never understood the point of it; he thought it a huge ANTI-climax, because he just never got it.

So it's very unlikely to be in the Platinum Edition, as that would require reconstructing the Shire sets (rebuilding an entire village) and going back into principle photography just for the DVD, which all the die-hard LOTR fans will buy anyway even without the scouring.

If it's there, I'll be utterly shocked and delighted.  But don't hold your breath!

7274618,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Really, there's no word matching up with this magnificent ending edition of the LOTR trilogy.

The director Mr. Peter Jackson has already showed us those wonderful bonus tracks in the theater version of ROTK dvd, which contained the process of moviemaking, interviews with actors and actresses, fansite featurettes, and national geography feature. And I find that it was just exciting to watch, and 'cherish' the LOTR dvd at home, even though I've watched ROTK in theater for 5 times. (In fact, to many LOTR fans, no matter when we watch those LOTR movies again and again, the movies come as just new ones. Like, you haven't seen those before)

Now it's time to have the final conlcusion of the great trilogy, thanks to the extended dvd edition. Moreover, from this collector's gift set, you'll be fully satisfied with meeting Minas Tirith (although it's miniature size) and bonus DVD of the LOTR symphony. You might know that Howard Shore's music was one of the main factors that drew this trilogy to the winner of 11 Academy awards.

If you are a real LOTR fanatic, it's not a choice;it's a must!",1096675200,8,1098,4.798941798941799

However, after I saw the movie I read the final book and there was 100 extra pages AFTER the ring was destroyed.  My favorite part of the book trilogy was without a doubt the Battle of Bywater.  It showed how much the Hobbits had changed and how bad ass they had become.  So if the extended version does not include the Battle of Bywater I will be very disappointed.  In my mind that was almost as crucial a part of the story as the ring being destroyed.",1096588800,18,626,4.299145299145299
7274620,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"In the winter of 2001 history was made in movie history; the Fellowship of the Ring was released to the world. Loved by fans of the trilogy by JRR Tolkien and adored by even those whom had not read it. The following year the Two Towers hit the box office and was a bigger hit then the first film. After the final chapter to the trilogy was released in 2003 it won a top record of 11 Academy Awards. Now the 4-disc DVD set to the biggest movie on the century is soon to be released. With 50 extra minutes of uncut footage taken out of the theatrical release and hours of bonus features. I won't be surprised if this DVD set breaks the record for most bought within the first day. I recommend this movie to any who has seen the first two, and if you haven't it would be wise to.",1096588800,9,776,4.078431372549019
7274621,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Earlier this year, on Oscar weekend in Hollywood, where I attended the INTO THE WEST party, a large-screen television had been set up so all the party-goers could watch the Oscars, in between oogling at the Tolkien art show with originals by Tim Kirk. As THE RETURN OF THE KING won in every notable category -- an historic 11 Oscars -- it was clear that this film delivered, as director Peter Jackson promlsed, the emotional payoffs set up in the first two films.

Not content to rest on his laurels, Jackson, who has said repeatedly that he's not a fan of director's cuts, affirmed his great interest in extended DVD sets, because it allowed him to offer an expanded version and the back-story as well. For most, the expanded version is enough; the back-story material is there if you want it.

As with the gift editions of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and THE TWO TOWERS, Jackson has put a lot of thought in assembling this final piece in his film trilogy. Certainly the extended DVD is reason enough to buy the film, but the gift set is for those Tolkien fans who want more -- much more; if you don't find it under the Christmas tree, buy this set for yourself because it's money well spent.

Beyond the two discs, with multiple commentaries, that comprise the extended DVD itself, the discs three and four comprise the back-story and supplemental material, as was the case with FELLOWSHIP and TWO TOWERS. In addition to the four discs, there's a bonus disc focusing on Howard Shore and his magnificent soundtrack; and, appropriately, the Minas Tirith sculpture (with hollow base, for keepsakes) by Sideshow-Weta is the ideal choice. (Among Tolkien collectibles, the Sideshow line stands alone in terms of quality and value. No question, Sideshow's line of LOTR sculptures, busts, and helms are accurate reproductions, beautifully sculpted, carefully painted, and are welcome additions to any Tolkien fan's collection.) Included only in the gift set, a coupon that allows you to buy the companion sculpture by Sideshow-Weta, Minas Morgul.

As far as DVD sets go, the LOTR extended sets have raised the bar in terms of customer expectations. Woe be to the film company that produces a DVD with no imagination, for the fans will notice. New Line Cinema and Weta teamed up to produce DVD sets that, with extended footage, deepen and enrich the viewing experience. (If you want to be overwhelmed, see this film on a 42-inch plasma television screen.)

At the San Diego Comicon, where Sideshow-Weta premiered the Minas Tirith statue for this gift set, and where New Line Cinema offered a preview of the additional footage, the fans responded very enthusiastically. I will not spoil your enjoyment of the new footage, but suffice it to say that it does does indeed deepen and enrich a film masterwork.

The passion and the attention to detail that has been lavished by New Line Cinema, Sideshow, and Weta have combined to give the Tolkien film fan the final piece, as it were, in the impressive edifice Jackson constructed.

There is no question that if you saw THE RETURN OF THE KING that you should buy the extended version on DVD; the only question that should be answered is simply this: Which edition? For my money, THIS is the edition of choice; and for your money, buy this edition, as you will have no regrets.

October 2004 marks the 50th anniversary of the publication of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING in the U.S., from Houghton Mifflin. Next year will see the continued celebration worldwide, as new editions of Tolkien's classics find their way to bookshelves everywhere. But, unlike the various book editions, there are only two editions of the Extended DVD of THE RETURN OF THE KING. Buy whatever you budget can afford, but do not miss the crown jewel of Jackson's triumphant film adaptations.",1096588800,14,3799,4.824884792626728

Some of the new scenes will include Aragorn confronting Sauron with the palantir, The Mouth of Sauron making an appearence, The houses of Healing and the meeting of EOwyn and Faramir and Gandalf battling the witch king of Angmar.

One word: Incredible!

If you love LOTR and specially ROTK you NEED this DVD Gif set.

The DVD Gift Set features the entire four-disc Special Extended Edition contained in an elaborate box with art conceived and designed solely for this package by famed J.R.R. Tolkien illustrator Alan Lee.

The artists at Weta workshop(the same of the movies!!!) offer their most intricately detailed DVD exclusive yet: a sculpture of Minas Tirith-the seven-tiered City of Kings and capital of Gondor.

The five-inch sculpture has Jackson's signature silkscreen-branded onto the bottom. The base of the Minas Tirith sculpture is positioned atop a keepsake box containing a fabric-lined tray inside of which is an embossment of the White Tree of Gondor, symbol of Gondor's rule and the emblem on its flag.

You love the music of the movies?? This  Gift Set will also contain a fifth DVD titled, Howard Shore: Creating The Lord of The Rings Symphony - A Composers Journey Through Middle-earth. This 52-minute bonus DVD includes excerpts of live concert footage of The Lord of the Rings Symphony recorded with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra.

7274627,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"You can probably guess from the title that this review is probably the most un-helpful nonsense ever written. You have been warned.

I was residing in England when rotk came out. I don't know what it was like for you guys in America but boy were we brainwashed. You couldn't go anywhere without some advertisement for the movie hitting you in the face. I'm a student and my only means of travel is by big double-decker busses. But I wasn't even safe at a bus stop since nearly every bus had a huge lotr poster covering its side. Amusingly enough is was of Sam passionately clutching Frodo in his arms. Is it me or do those two hobbits have the hots for each other?

I saw tfotr in Tenerife, Spanish dub. Me and my friend Sam (seriously I have four friends all called Sam) decided to check it out. We had no idea what it was about, plus it started five minutes before anyone was in the theatre so we all missed the beginning explanation. Anyway sam and me tried our best. An hour and a half later the bell rang for half time (yeah this old Spanish cinema gives you a 5 minute break half way through to stock up on munchies, go to the bathroom, phone a friend etc.) Anyway me and Sam were kind of worried since the film should of ended by now. We came on foot at ten o-clock at night, so we were starting to get apprehensive. Plus the temperature had dropped rapidly and you don't get heating in Tenerife. The little five year olds (you don't get ratings either) were bored and had starting running up and down the isles. The film finally resumed. After we had stopped laughing at the very humorous death of Boromeir (pincushion) we were completely floored by the lovely display of affection between Frodo and Sam. The ending confirmed it for us

`I'm glad you're with me Sam', croons Frodo as Sam gazes dreamily at him, while the panpipes from titanic got into full swing.
As I walked home at half past one in the morning terrified for my safety and hastily looking for sex maniacs I vowed to see the rest.

Right so any way I'm in Leeds staring at this huge poster on this huge bus and I decided Id have to go. The Two Towers had already provided me with more meaningful glances and romantic dialogue between the two of them.

English cinemas in Leeds are much grander then that of Tenerife and we all piled in. There wasn't a seat empty. We all arrived an hour early to get seats so everyone chatted to pass the time. When the lights finally dimmed I was more then ready for the film to begin...only to be bombarded by half an hour of advertisements for other films. By the time trotk started I had drunk my whole large coke. Not a good idea. These grandiose cinemas don't have quaint little breaks for people to relieve themselves. I ran out and just found my way back through enormous sea of people in time the see Gandalf the white. My god I was nearly blinded. Is this guy in cahoots with Daz washing powder? You'd think after all that horse riding he'd be a little dirty but this guy is practically glowing with freshly washed, line-dried radiance. This film has some seriously funny quirks that aren't supposed to be there. Like how can Eowyn chop off that dragons head in two swipes? What the hell? Superwoman is that you? Orlando Bloom should just remain the silent pretty one because he can't act to save his life. Aragon's accent goes from american to english and back like no bodies business. I think the joking around with Gimli has gone far enough, did he have a point in this movie other then comic relief. Merry and Pippin did much better in this. They seem to like each other pretty, ahem, much as well.

Pippin: `I knew you'd find me! Are you going to leave me again?
Merry: `No Merry...I'm going to take care of you'

Everybody:AWWWWWWWWWW!!!!

And then we come to the loony steward. Wow does this guy have some issues. Like a few sandwiches short of a picnic. He seems to be quite resistant to fire too, since he ran all that way to throw himself off the highest point of minas tirith. Should be called suicide ledge, its perfect. Anyway onto Frodo and Sam. Sam's been drugging Frodo's water (what else would explain all that swaying) in order to have his way with him. I have never seen so many `almost' kiss scenes in my life.  Can Frodo's eyes bulge out any more? I mean he looked like flick from A Bug's Life. Then when they're on that conveniently placed rock surrounded by lava Sam brings up Rosie for no reason what so ever. Frodo is undeterred and goes for it and the scene respectively pans to black. I would have been satisfied with that ending I really would. In fact I was just so happy it was over. I thought I might have contracted deep vein thrombosis from sitting there so long. But no sooner had i emitted my sigh of relief when back comes the picture and we were presented with another 4 endings. I won't mention the slow mo hobbit romp on the bed ending.
Finally Sam marries Rosie for no obvious reason, and Frodo is so hurt he leaves. But before he says his final farewell he kisses Sam on the...forehead and explains that he can't be torn in two (between Frodo and Rosie) forever.
When I came out of the cinema I realised I had been sat there for 5 hours. I could hardly walk. Dont get me wrong this is a good film, but it strings you along. If they were not going to be together at the end, why all those hints that there's somthing going on?. It annoyed me. Its as if it was done purly for scandal and fanfiction writers, who are having a wale of a time.

7274630,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"First off, those of you saying this is a kid's movie . . .o please . . . .as many people think, LOTR is not a cutesy little fairy tale about a fantastic (meaning something in a fantasy) hero who saves the day.  LOTR is a war movie.  If you bothered watching any of the interviews, they will say that Tolkien wrote these books based on his experiences in WWII.  He hated war.  Saruman is a fantastic version of Hitler.  The power of the ring if often discussed.  The ring itself has no power . . . the power of the ring is the FEAR it creates . . .""a nameless fear"" (quote from the movie).  Tolkien wrote the books as though it were history.  Peter Jackson does a wonderful job of creating this ""realism.""  Honestly, I watch other movies now (such as Spiderman) and don't enjoy them near as much because of the lack of realism.  Frodo is no Hercules.  His strong friendship with Sam and his pitty for Gollum alone save him.  The civilizations in Middle Earth are based on old European civilizations.  Rohan, for example, is based on the Anglo-Saxon society.  All the names relating to Rohan contain a prefix meaning ""horses.""  You can find that out reading the Appendixes.  The Appendixes also make this story seem so real.  Any facts you need to know about the history of Middle Earth can be found in it.  Very rarely will you find something like this in a fictional book.  Only non-fiction history books are that organized.  Tolkien set a new standard for books.  At the time this was written, nothing like LOTR was around.  It was originally supposed to be in one-volume.  Tolkien much disliked the idea of splitting up the books, but at that time, paper was very expensive and the book would be too highly priced to get many sales, so his publishers agreed to split the book.  It took a while for LOTR to catch on, but eventually, people all around the world began reading it and it became the trilogy it is today.",1095724800,5,1917,4.426934097421204

7274634,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"long before Return Of The King was released in theaters in December 2003, i tried endlessly to imagine what it would look like onscreen. and my interpretations were nothing compared to the final outcome. this is by far the most emotional film i have ever seen, more so than the previous LOTR films combined, which i admit shedding a few tears at. but watching ROTK, i cried full on buckets. while most people marvel at the grand scale of Minas Tirth or the mass destruction at Pelennor Fields, i feel most in touch with the power of human, er...hobbit emotion. Sam's undying devotion for his master Frodo is more powerful to me than the Ring itself. even after Frodo sends him packing, Sam's not about to abandon his best friend. no way will he allow Frodo to become dinner for the ravenous Shelob. and he's sure as hell not going to permit the Orcs to have their way with him. and he's definitely not going to stand for Frodo claiming the Ring at the foot of the Crack Of Doom. it's truly a shame that Sean Astin wasn't nominated for an Oscar. he truly deserved it, as did many of the actors/actresses in the film. in fact, i'm fairly certain i cried for the last 90 minutes of the film (and that also includes the closing credits featuring Annie Lennox's haunting voice).

generally in films, it's the larger and more noticeable scenes that stand out in the audience's mind. for me, it was the simple opening sequence- where the young Smeagol is introduced in the flesh, unaware that he is about to embark on the ultimate trip to Hell with no return ticket. to me, witnessing his most unfortunate downward spiral is the most shocking and remarkable film clip i've ever seen. for years, i despised Gollum for my own personal reasons. but seeing him come to life onscreen made me feel sympathy for him, especially when it came to presenting him in his previous incarnation, which clearly demonstrates that no one is perfect. but one thing is for certain- the last chapter of the LOTR films is more perfect than i could have ever imagined.",1094774400,,2038,4.5683060109289615

7274637,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The LOTR trilogy of films is a beautiful, perfect set that will live on forever in homes and in 'favorite movie' lists. Each one simply got better and better until we reached the glorious Return of the King. Very long film? Oh, yes. It doesn't feel like three hours, but it approximately is, and though you'll need to set aside lots of time and be prepared to watch for quite a while, you'll want it to go on at the end. Indeed, there are many points near the end when it feels as though the movie's over, yet it goes on. However, the story is so lengthy, intricate, and amazing, that it would be impossible to do it otherwise. Everything needs to be wrapped up for everyone; a drawn-out conclusion is not only necessary, but for those who truly appreciate brilliant movies, heartily welcome. In fact, the ending of this movie is one of the biggest tear-jerkers I can think of.

Excellent special effects and long action sequences do not detract from the magic of the books; they only enhance it. The object of these movies was to translate the books to the screen in the best way possible, and without distorting them gruesomely. In this the moviemakers, ALL of them, cast and crew, have succeeded most admirably. As Peter Jackson reminds us time and again in the special features, the effects could easily have overwhelmed the story. Thanks to him, they did not.

Every last character and second of these movies gripped me and made me into an instant LOTR fan; I read the books only after seeing these excellent movies. It's a magnificently told fantasy story for everyone--children, parents, and others. Such a marvelous achievement is very, very difficult not to adore. Watching the LOTR movies is a thrill from beginning to end. No conclusion could have been better than the Return of the King. This is another rare example of moviemaking at its very best. And to add, the DVD is BRILLIANT as well; no audio commentary, sadly, but enough documentation, music videos, etc., to keep one entertained for a very, very long time. The interviews with the cast and crew are INCREDIBLY insightful; it's unbelievable how much more there is to know about the movie! Its making seems to have been an adventure in itself.

Very few tales can compare to the majesty and splendor of LOTR, and it could not possibly have been made into a better film series. See them sometime in your life.",1093996800,,2379,4.65952380952381

Not only was much of the original material overlooked, but new material was added that did nothing to enhance the story. Did Peter Jackson think that no one would come see the movie if there was no romance? Romance was added and at the most inappropriate moments. Characters died that never did, true heroism was turned into cloying, wistful looks and less than heroic speech. Worst of all was the return of Sam and Frodo to the untouched Shire.  Tolkien was making a huge point by having them return to a Shire that was being ravaged and ripped apart. It would seem that no one connected with these movies bothered to read or understand Tolkien's work.

Granted, the movies are much better than the books, as Tolkein was a linguist not a novelist, he didn't know how to write fiction and compelling sequences.  All I'm asking for is a little sense from you people.  Grown, (hopefully) mature human beings.  I mean, come on. That scene where Legolas takes out the oliphant ( not an elephant, mind you ) is totally absurd and ridiculous.  If you like that, you might as well start worshipping the Wachoski bros who gave you such beautiful and also such mindless action scenes as are featured in the second and third Matrix installments.  The time spent on Legolas, and also on the stupid carry-over joke of Gimli and Legolas's body count competition from The Two Towers could have been spent on more interesting things, such as the conflict between Gandalf and the crazed steward, or detailing some of the amusing incidents from the book where Samwise and Frodo take on orc clothing and start a mini battle of their own between to different factions of orcs.  And, lest I forget, how could you insane ninnies ignore the horrible editing in the last 10 minutes of the film?  You must be descended from ostriches and love to hide your heads in the sand when you see crap like that in something you want so desperately to love...I mean, the first hideously, perversely long fade to black as Frodo and Sam are about to be overtaken by lava...the second repetitive, onerous long fade to black after you think most of the loose narratives are tied up...the fade to white...AND STILL THE MOVIE GOES ON!!! To cap it off, we need to have yet another End-of-the-movie-Speech by Mr. Samwise Gamgee!  It's useless.  The whole affair makes any decent bipedal hominid with opposable thumbs and a fair sized frontal cortex want to sign off on the human species as a whole and let the rest of you wights stumble about in mud and your own feccal matter till Sol goes supernova in a few billion...Oh yes, one more thing.  The Lord of the Rings is not a trilogy.  A trilogy is a group of three INDEPENDENT works, related by theme, characters, subject matter, etc.  You can look it up.  The key word being independent: I dare anyone one of you to honestly believe that you can read any of the three books and NOT NEED to read any of the others to complete the story line. (I double dare you to do that with The Two Towers.)  The Lord of the Rings is one work, which just happens to have three freaking parts.  The same goes double for the movies: One work, three parts.  Much like the Holy Trinity, if any of you yahoos might know what that is.",1093824000,8,2650,4.50836820083682

Nothing topped this in my mind, though Kill Bill Vol 1 came a little bit close...but still, this movie is a masterpiece, along with the other 2. Peter Jackson has outdone himself and he won't quit...The Hobbit would so kick ass if he does it. This chroniclizes up to the end where Frodo not throws, but pushes Gollum off the side into the fires of Mount Doom. With special effects that are simply amazing and more powerful and exceptional acting from the last. Viggo should be a king damnit..he would make a great leader as well. Ian McKellan is simply brilliant as Gandalf...Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are wonderful as Frodo and Sam..Orlando Bloom and John Ryhes Davies do the best at Gimli and Legolas and who can forget Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan as Pippin and Merry. If your not a fan of this stuff, why watch it? What's the point? I am glad it won 11 oscars with Best Picture but come on damnit, where are the nominees for acting? The award ceremony's are a joke.

One thing I didn't like was that the battles seemed a bit rushed. For example, in Two Towers, The Battle of Helm's Deep really seemed like a HUGE battle and it really sort of, put you there if you know what I mean. It was very well done and I loved all aspects of that battle, the preparing, the elves, the men thinking that they will not live out the night. It's all good. But in the Battle of Minas Tirith, it didn't show much of that emotion. I mean, the armies just... came...

7274643,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The best was definitely saved for last, as the Return of the King ends the great Tolkien trilogy in grand and spectacular fashion.  In this installment, Frodo (Elijah Wood) is continuing his journey to Mordor to destroy the One Ring of Power in the lava fields of Mt. Doom.  Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), heir to the kingdom of Men endures a tremendous battle at Minas Tirith with the help of his loyal friends Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and, of course, Gandalf (Ian McKellen).

Frodo and Sam must also survive the deceptions of Gollum (Andy Serkis), who is trying to steal the ring for himself.

After watching the first two installments of the trilogy, I have been eagerly anticipating the release of The Return of the King, and the wait was well worth it.  The special effects in this movie are simply unbelievable.  The battle scenes at Minas Tirith surpass those of Helm's Deep in The Two Towers, and the new creatures are really cool.

I'm truly sorry to see this wonderful trilogy come to an end.  As a fantasy movie and book fan, I can only hope that another series of movies will come along that are as good as this series is.  Needless to say, I give this movie, and the whole series, my highest recommendation.  The acting and special effects are superb, and the action is non-stop.

7274645,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I mean no disrespect, but I feel I must set the records straight. Mr. Sypolt from Pennsylvania, I believe, is sorely mistaken in regards to the spelling of Saruman and his ultimate fate. The movie and book made no mention of him being turned into an orc. In fact, it didn't mention any specifics as to his whereabouts after his escape(sorry for spoiling part of the book) until the end of the third book-not mentioned in the movie-in which case he was still definitely not an orc. Please do not inform people on subjects which you yourself are not so well informed. Try going to the book section on this site for the three-in-one Lord of the Rings trilogy for a very reasonable price.

  The third installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is, In my opinion the best for any action fan like myself. While some are entirely correct in saying that the plot of the movie and book are only loosely connected, and the movie fails to reproduce the same feeling the book offered, I believe it is the best possible rendition of this story that can still satisfy such a large audience.

  Every actor, even the local New Zealander playing Eomer, delivered a top notch performance. So much so, that I could not find anything in the acting that took away from the overall milieu the film offered.

  If you want to watch this movie I suggest first clearing your schedule for 3 and a half hours or so, unplug the phone, shut the blinds, and get a nice bowl of caramel popcorn(all optional, naturally) and immerse yourself in this incredible cinematic work of art.",1093046400,2,1554,4.541218637992832

That said, these movies were bad, though skillfully made, I suppose, in their own way, and somehow strangely watchable, for a few minutes a time, at least until the cheesiness factor overwhelms and you're forced to change the channel.  Hard to sit down and watch each film in one sitting (especially the super-extended director's editions, which I am proud to say I don't own and will never go out of my way to watch), seeing as how they suck and all.",1092873600,3,697,4.642276422764228
7274647,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"Because of my high expectations after reading the book, well, I wish I hadn't red the book first. I saw the previous two LOTR before I started on the book, and they really thrilled me, both being great adventure-movies, the best I'd ever seen since Indiana Jones (if I am allowed to compare them) - I've noticed afterwards Mr. Jackson has been far from faithful to the book on all three movies, but his version of ""The Fellowship..."" I can swallow - mostly he has picked out the essential of the story in the first book, and I have actually nothing against the relationship he has ""made up"" between Arwen and Aragorn (the book gives you a hint - you can read about the origin and fate of their love in one the chapters that follows after the end of ""The Return...""). I find this movie the best of the three. Five stars.

""Two Towers"" has several lacks, and especially the ""wolf-attack""-scene has irritated a friend of mine and me over and over again. What's the point?? There's PLENTY of action in the book of the ""Two Towers"" - and Aragorn falling off the cliff with, in my opinion, one of those dumb-looking wolves is only for the frustration and embarrasment to all those who have red the book - I don't get it... Thank God Mr. Jackson didn't bring Arwen to Helms' Deep(!) like he actually had planned. Thank God!

There are plenty of other lacks in this one already. BUT, other than that, all in all, I find it as a mighty movie. I don't mean to say it is bad, not at all, but it could have been a lot better I personally think - and I find some of Mr. Jacksons' changes from the original story very unnecessary. 3 stars.

""The Return Of The King"" - this one we had all been looking forwards to for a LONG time - the opening scene with the story behind Gollum is a masterpiece, well done Mr. Jackson, it's poetic and actually rather frightning (the actor behind Gollum is great). Then, the first time I saw it, it was all downhills -I don't know where to begin, but the pictures the book had left in my head didn't fit with what was going on on the screen. It was supposed to be dark, not rainy grey sky - that's not the most important thing I realize, but the movie turned out to be another epic-adventure-war-drama - missing the essential nerve of the book - for me it became too much effects - there were mighty scenes here no doubt, but... Minas Tirith, vow! But I was actually left with the impression that Mr. Jackson & co had been in a hurry at the end. She-La was creepy, but it could have been done creepier like in the book where Frodo AND(!) Sam tumbles around in the smelly darkness feeling evil eyes set on them, watching their every move, when suddenly ATTACK! But the main lack of them all, Sarumann - I can't understand how they could ""forget"" him, I know the extended version is yet to come, but this was a tragedy even for the theatrical version. He's one of the main characters in the book, especially in the end of ""The Return..."" - and I fear the extended version won't be adding the final chapter (the great ending) - in that case I find it impossible to forgive. The eye of Sauron when Frodo and Sam stumbles against Mount Doom looks pathetic, it looks just like a lighcaster at a prisontower - and I'm not the first to've noticed that.

I've seen the movie six times or so now, it was better the second time after my big disappointment. I know I'm being negative against this great triology of an epic-adventure story told on screen. And that many will probably disagree with me, but in the end all that this is, just entertainment. And these movies function extremely well in that way - good acting, great filming and camera-work, nearly perfect locations for the the world and creatures of Middle Earth - it's just that for a movie supposed to be so true to the spirit of this famous book and to Tolkien I think when we reach to the end of it, I at least, it's not as true to the book as it should have been, a little too much hollywood sometimes.

Its amazing, how one man, one mind can produce such a wonderful,

rich, detailed and marvelous world like he did. Its truly amazing. I will never be able to comprehend how he did it, much like peter jackson. I cant believe what masterpiece's some people can make in this world, its simply beautiful and brilliant. We have only God to thank for that, who gives these wonderful gifts and talents to us, and obviously he was with Tolkien while he wrote these books (he was a big Catholic or something i believe, lol), and with peter as well. GREAT JOB ALL OF YOU!!!!!I LOVE YOU ALL FOR MAKING THESE BOOKS AND FILMS!!!lol.

Really though, I wish i could go to Middle Earth, of which I know many of you also would love to live there in Hobbiton, and The Shire. Ever since I saw the Shire in 'Fellowship', i just wanted to live there, with Sam, Merry, and Pippin (though i don't know if I would see Frodo there, because he would be in the Grey Havens most likely) and all those cute Hobbit girls, lol. It makes me sad at times, seeing our world and how screwed up it can be at times, but as long as we're in Middle Earth in our hearts, we will always be there. And hey!, i got my Extended Editions and Books, so i can go there whenever i want!!lol, but truly, i believe that our earth isn't so far from Middle Earth, and I think many people will agree with that (Hitler as Sauron, or even Bin Laden, and the Orcs are the Mindless, Moralless Terrorists whom if I were Aragorn would swipe them off this Planet!!) But for me, i will always live in Middle earth, and i believe that out of every Race in Middle Earth, I am a hobbit, a little bit of all four of the Hobbits we know (wink), and i cannot wait till the Extended Edition for The Return Of The King comes out, and from what i hear, a nice Collectors Edition with a Minas Tirith Collectible sounds great!! But now I wish i got the other Collectibles' Versions, like the Fellowship one with Falls Of Rarous stone kings collectibles, but not so much the Gollum one for The Two Towers, hes just way to creepy for my taste. I mean, hes an amazing creature on film, but in reality, man hes just CREEPY!!lol. But anyway, brilliant movie, amazing book, and I will always treasure them and keep them close to my heart. I recommend The Extended Edition for this Final Installment for the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, even when its not out yet! but see, its THAT good. The last two Extended Editions did not dissapoint me, and this one will be definetly be the Crown Jewel of my Collection. What I REALLY hope for is the scene where Sarumans Staff is broken. OOO I can see it now, just like in the book, when Gandlaf puts up his hand and using his mind strength in what will hopefully be a powerful moment, He says 'Saruman, your Staff is broken"", and then a powerful 'CRACK!' and Saruman screaming and stuff.

7274651,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"A lot could have gone wrong with the making the Lord of the Rings trilogy and impressively very little actually did.  Along the same lines, nothing could have been more difficult to make than a finale that out did its predecessors. The Return of the King manages just this feat; it matches the first film [Fellowship of the Ring] and actually surpasses the Two Towers.

This 3 1/2 hour epic saga starts at where the Two Towers left off.  Frodo and his loyal sidekick Sam follow their dark mission Mordor to destroy the ring or perish.  Along the way theyve picked up Smeagol (Gollum played by Andy Serkis in an amazing performance) who commits his evil mischief.

The other members of the fellowship gather around Gandalf and the future king of Gondor, Aragon in preparation for battle against Mordors evil legions. As with the first two films the rendering of Middle Earth is astonishing.  The care and detail given to characters, costume and sets is apparent throughout.

Tolkeins Lord of the Rings trilogy is a wonderful epic for our time. A deeply religious Roman Catholic who felt himself out of place in the 20th century, Tolkien Middle Earth is a place of good versus evil. Unlike cold modernity, Tolkien made it a place where spirit, brotherhood and determination could overcome adversity.

In the end Jackson does a superb job bringing the trilogy to a climax. There are small quibbles to be sure (for example there is no love story in the written story, minor characters are missing, etc.) but Jackson keeps a fairly steady hand on Tolkeins vision.  Perhaps those of us who grew up reading Lord of the Rings feel a different affinity to it than most but whatever the reason I think Jacksons epic is superb and this, the finale is truly excellent storytelling and mythmaking.",1092355200,2,1784,4.766233766233766

 It is about the resilience of human spirit. It is about us and our desire to survive against all odds. It is about our iron will and our capability to unite and fight against common enemy who threatens our kind.
 This is why Lord of the Rings has struck a chord with all those who dare to plunge into its dark depths and evil plots.
 If Tolkein's book was grand with graphic details about massive orc armies threatning the middle earth, Peter Jackson's movie is well, ""grander"".
 Director Peter Jackson brings to life what all of us could only imagine. True, some things are not exactly as they are in the book, but the changes are apt and in many cases necessary. For example, do you really want to hear all the songs Merry and Pippin sing in the books? I was relieved I didn't have to.
  The movie begins where the last one left off, Gollums treachery and Froddo's encounter with Shelob. The book had this covered in Two Towers itself but the movie carries it beautifully in the Return of the King.
 The only other deviation worth mentioning is towards the end when triumphant Froddo returns to the Shire and finds Saruman and Wormtongue bullying the Hobbits. This part was not shown at all.
 Apart from that each and every detail of the book, from elf world to city of minas tirith has been beautifully recreated. The green ghost army of mountain men and humungous Oliphaunts add to the magnificience of the story line. If you take a deep breath your heart will start pounding as men struggle against all odds to beat Sauron's orcs.
Aragorn and Arwen's fairy tale love, Gimli and Legolas' friendly, almost playfull rivalry and Froddo and Samwise Gamgee's deep bond of friendship bursts forth in a thousand colors and leaves you wondering how the director managed to do it all in such vivid details while maintaining the flow of the book and coherency of the plot.
 My favourity scenes include battle for Minas Tirith and owyn's valor as she slices dragon's neck and then kills Nazgul. My wife's include love scenes between Arwen and Aragorn adorned with beautiful, almost delicate elf words.

7274660,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"BRAVO and thank you Peter Jackson's for your absolutely awesome adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's epic ""Lord of the Ring Trilogy!"" I read these extraordinary books back in the 1960s, and never thought their amazing fantasy characters and complex story could be brought to life. You seem to have pulled off a cinematic miracle with ""The Fellowship of the Rings"" and ""The Two Towers,"" and your concluding piece, ""The Return of the King"" is near perfection. It is truly a jewel. For almost 3 years we have been waiting for the conclusion, the resolution to the saga. I got chills watching the movie - it is that vivid an experience. These three films are destined to become beloved classics, in the public's Movie Hall of Fame, if they are not already.

 The intrepid hobbits, Frodo, (Elijah Wood), Sam, (Sean Astin), and the creature Gollum, (Andy Serkis), are on the final leg of their mission to destroy the Ring in Mount Doom. Frodo is exhausted and the Ring continues to sap him of his strength with every footstep. Meanwhile, Gandalf the Wizard, (Ian McKellan), Aragorn the ranger, (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the elf, (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli the dwarf, (John Rhys-Davies), reunite with their hobbit friends Pippin, (Billy Boyd) and Merry, (Dominic Monaghan), in the wake of the battle of Isengard. Director Jackson tracks Frodo and his two companions through the terrible dangers and betrayals which confront them in Morder. At the same Gandalf and Pippin ride to the city of Minas Tirith to warn them against coming invasion. And Aragorn makes ready to lead his people against the forces of evil, and to announce himself as Isildur's heir, the returned King of Gondor.

 The Battle of the Pelennor Fields is one of the most exciting moments in my personal movie history. I felt like I was in the midst of the battle and actually got an adrenaline rush. The film moves at such a rapid pace that I totally lost track of time. Jackson has saved some of the film trilogy's best moments for last. The Siege of Minas Tirith and the Battle of the Pelennor Fields are super superb, edge-of your seat excellent movie moments. Frodo's triumph and the return of the king, the coronation, are, for me, the crowning glory.

 Elijah Wood no longer shines as Frodo. He is a thin, waif-like, shadow of the cheerful hobbit he once was. The boy has become a man who shoulders burdens most men could not bear. Wood's change is palpable and his acting wonderful. Sean Astin's affable Sam has become Frodo's fierce protector, ready to kill to defend his companion against the treacherous Gollum, and the darkness of Mordor. Viggo Mortensen plays Aragorn with the nobility and courage befitting a king. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies provide needed comic relief from all the intense action. Miranda Otto's Eowen is beautiful, and as fierce a soldier as any man on the battlefield. All in all, the acting is magnificent - a real achievement. However, this is ensemble acting at its best. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Finally, all the characters from the earlier films reunite ar the end for a last good-bye.

 I highly recommend ""The Return of the King' and the entire trilogy. I plan to rent all three over the next rainy weekend.

7274663,1,B00Z9YZRVE,"Having immensely enjoyed the first 2 movies of the trilogy, I never expected Return of the King to be such an absolute disaster. Jackson took a masterpiece and destroyed it in every conceivable way, from the way he perverted the storyline, to the insipid script, the horrible acting, the lack of dramatic buildup and the surprisingly weak special effects. From the beginning, with the very unrealistic-looking scene of Smeagol being towed along by a fish, it was obvious that Jackson dropped the ball. Having no choice but to see the whole movie, I watched as he completely cut out one of the most dramatic and significant scenes in the whole story-the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf- and then gave incredibly short shrift to the meeting of the Ents, Gandalf, Theoden, etc. and the finding of the Palantir. The movie also featured some really bizarre plot and character changes: Theoden's initial refusal to aid Gondor, Denethor's complete character transmogrification from a wise, but despairing king into a barbaric fool, the silly decision to shove the Arwen character down out throats in every other scene, the asinine plot innovation of having Frodo and Sam feud, etc. Then there were scenes which just were laughably bad. The lighting of the signal fires was very unrealistic. The attack on Minas Tirith was nowhere near as impressive as the Battle of Helm's Deep in Two Towers. The Army of the Dead looked like something from Ghostbusters or Pirates of the Caribbean. And the final assault on Mordor was pitiful and undramatic, with a rather comical Eye of Sauron looking on. I could go on and on. This movie reeked, in every way and Tolkien fans should not reward Peter Jackson by buying this movie, especially since that con man is only going to come out with an extended version later on in the summer.",1091059200,25,1823,4.902912621359223

7274668,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Return of the King is quite possibly one of the greatest movies of all time.

Let me begin, by saying that I am a HUGE Tolkien fan, and have read almost all of his works on Middle Earth.  And, I know that there are some Tolkien purists who do not approve of some of the changes Peter Jackson made, but, these are the same people that complain about the length of the movie...well, if all the story/dialogues were left in the film, each part of the trilogy would be 6+ hours and probably would just be better left as a novel.  It's enjoyable reading every little thing in the Tolkien books, but, I don't think watching two people sit and talk for 3 hours straight on the silver screen would be the same enjoyment.

Peter Jackson did an amazing job of capturing the spirit of the books.  With an amazing array or special effects, incredibly moving performances, and an outstanding recreation of Middle Earth, Jackson's Return of the King is the final tale of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and delivers a knockout.  Though there are some changes within the tale, what remains is the best for the big screen and brings the viewer into the Middle Earth world.

The sound and picture quality of RotK are a step above almost any other movie out today.  The special features are a bit lacking, but are good for a viewer who is unfamiliar with some of the Middle Earth material.

Overall, this is a movie that shouldnt be left out of anyone's collection.",1090627200,15,1446,4.467680608365019

Jackson's LOTR trilogy while still an adaptation of the classic book is still a landmark in cinematic history for all time. The sheer energy , love, and masterful film craftsmanship including director-writer-producer Peter Jackson's input will never be equalled. The 1-star reviews are from teenager Matrix despondents who think the Matrix leather-clad style is somehow representative of ""reality"" in the world.

7274671,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"While ""Return of the King"" certainly holds up the fine cinematic craftsmanship of the first two movies, this installment feels incredibly contrite in comparison. Part of this probably comes from the fact that Jackson left so much of the books to be told in the movie. In the effort to fit everything in, many characters, which had been painstakingly developed over the first two movies, become charicatures of themselves. This holds especially true for Aragorn, who has miraculously morphed from ranger running from his past to fearless leader and king. Saurman, who was an important part of the first two movies, isn't even seen in the theatrical release. It is this kind of thing that makes the movie frustrating. Furthermore, the first two movies did not sacrafice character development for the sake of the effects, but that feels like it's happened in this installment.

 Overall, the movie is satisfying, but not nearly at the level of the first movie -- and certainly NOT worthy of the 11 oscars it won over more deserving contenders (e.g., Lost In Translation).

 As for the DVD, picture and sound quality are top notch, but features are thin.

 Perhaps the forthcoming extended release DVD will allow fans to realize this film for what it could have been.",1090454400,3,1263,4.933962264150943
7274672,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"?The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King? - though, in my view, not quite as compelling as the monumental ?The Two Towers? that directly preceded it - is, nevertheless, a worthy conclusion to this one-of-a-kind cinematic achievement.  In the final installment of the trilogy, the hobbit Frodo, his loyal companion, Sam, and the nefarious cretin Gollum, are still heading toward Mount Doom to destroy the ring which threatens to hold the world in its diabolical grasp.  Meanwhile a whole host of other characters do further battle with the forces of evil massing to take over Middle-Earth.

Under Peter Jackson?s skillful directorial guidance, never have the resources of cinema ? cinematography, art direction, matte design, special effects ? been marshaled with more effectiveness in bringing a fantasy world to vivid life.  As with ?The Two Towers,? the eyes pop and the jaw drops at the sheer magnificence of the spectacle taking place on screen.  The seemingly endless vistas, sweeping camera movements, ferocious battle sequences and one truly terrifying giant spider offer some of the most visually astonishing moments in motion picture history.  It will be a long time before we encounter a film project of this size and scope again.

What struck me most while watching ?The Return of the King? was how Tolkien had created a view of the Middle Ages as it might have been had Christianity never existed ? a view that film, by its intrinsically visual nature, only enhances.  As the camera scans the horizon, we are struck by the fact that there are no cathedrals, no country churches, no spires dominating the landscape.  In a similar way, there are no clergy present, no Christian symbols such as crosses or rosary beads, no sacred artwork ? all visuals that define our image of the Middle Ages.  Instead of priests there are wizards and elves; instead of crucifixes, we find magic rings and New Age medallions.  ?The Return of the King? allows us to re-imagine a period in history, bereft of the single most dominating influence that came to define that era.  It?s still the classic battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil that have defined human history - but as filtered through Tolkien?s Teutonic imagination and vision, that conflict becomes the stuff of mythology and legend.

In the mass of special effects, it?s easy to overlook the fine performances of Elijah Woods as Frodo, Sean Astin as Sam, and Andy Serkis as Gollum, who together provide the heart and soul needed to keep this sprawling epic tale life-sized and moving.

If truth be told, impressive as this film undoubtedly is, a certain ? perhaps inevitable - fatigue factor does creep in during portions of this third installment.  Perhaps the elements that seemed so fresh in ?The Two Towers? ? the epic battle scenes, on a scale far grander than any we had ever before encountered, or the schizophrenic conflict between good and evil being waged inside Gollum?s twisted psyche ? seem like just more of the same here.  Unlike the second part, ?The Return of the King? provides little that is new to take us to that higher level we keep hoping for and expecting.

That being said, I must also add that the emotional impact of the final moments is simply overwhelming, as the characters we have come to know and love over the course of the tale engage in the most moving scenes of leave-taking and parting since ?The Wizard of Oz? and ?E.T.?  There are some who have balked at the sentimental nature of these moments, calling them anticlimactic and self-indulgent, yet after having invested so much time getting to know these characters and sharing in their adventure, the audience has earned the right to a bit of over-the-top sentiment, and I see no reason to criticize the filmmakers for pulling out all the emotional stops here.  If anything, these scenes demonstrate the intense bond Jackson and his crew have forged with their legions of loyal, appreciative fans.

There?s no doubt about it, taken as a whole, this nine-hour-plus saga of ?The Lord of the Rings? is one of the great epic experiences of our time.",1090368000,,4113,4.856938483547926
7274673,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"Peter Jackson and Co. have done some very nice work, and The Return of the King is a treat to watch. The New Zealand landscapes, in particular, are spectacular; the images of signal fires on the mountains between Rohan and Gondor are wonderful to see. Of course the costumes and other accoutrements of the dwellers in Middle Earth are handsome as well. Unfortunately, the dialogue doesn't live up to the visuals; PJ and Co. should have stuck to Tokien's words instead of reinterpreting them. The CG battles become a little repetitive and tedious; some characters, like Legolas the elf, are given even less to say than Clint Eastwood in the days of his wild west sagas. Elijah Wood's woefully pained and anxious expression remained constant from the beginning of the film until the destruction of the Ring. The writers' transformation of Denethor was particularly dreadful; instead of the strong but flawed individual created by Tokien we are given a raving, dribbling lunatic. However, all flaws aside, this is high entertainment, and a good way to spend a rainy afternoon.",1090368000,,1073,5.0

Although I loved the movie, I did have one complaint: the whole Saruman plotline is wrapped up in a really odd way.  (Peter Jackson promises that this will be rectified in the extended version.)  The extras on this DVD aren't anything special, but I don't buy DVDs for the extras.

7274677,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"It is impossible to fairly credit the genius and masterpiece that this movie is in a few short words. Each movie in my opinion, has been better than the last, making for an epic third movie.
To begin with, the acting. People have said that the acting in each of the three movies has never been exceptionall, hence only one Oscar nomination to an actor/actress out of all three movies, (That was Ian McKellan FOTR.) However in this third installment there are several actors who must be recognized for their achievments, namely Sean Astin as Sam, and again Ian McKellan as Gandalf. Sam's incredible acting with his relationship with Frodo draws sympathy and emotion from me every time I see the movie. And Gandalf, with his several stirring speeches, both mostly to Pipin, are a a great acting performance worthy of recognition. Honorable mention must also go to Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Bernard Hill, who plays Theoden extremely well.
Next a look at the visual aspect of the movie. In a sense of the natural beauty of the film, it is incredible. All three films incorporate a level of beauty and grandeur hard to find in many films. New Zealands fresh and exotic landscapes are always present throught the film, and can often take ones breath away. One scene in particular is that of the lighting of the beacons, as Peter Jackson takes the viewer on a spectacular ride over snowy mountains and sweeping valleys. The shot itself is not only a testiment to the amazing cinemetography and editing of the movie, but also the amazing beauty of New Zealand that is presented through the entire film.
However as with the first two movies, The Return of the King's visual aspect relies not only on New Zelands beauty and Peter Jackson's camera moves, but also upon the amazing digital and visual effects that are integrated seamlessly throughout the movie. The Weta Digital visual effects team that brought to life such creatures as Gollem and Treebeard, have created the benchmark by which all visual effects will likely be judged from here on. Their ability to make a digital thing like Gollem who exists in a computer resonate emotion and feeling is a work of true genius. The visual effects shine not only in the obvious areas such as Gollum, but in the subtle effects that can barely be noticed; shadows formed by digital creatures that aren't there, lighting effects that create a mood in the scene that is otherwise non-existent. All of these things have been worked together so will with the real-time footage and acting, that you end up never knowing what is real and what is digital.
Everytime I watch the movie, I never am bored. Peter Jackson has made a perfect blend of drama, emotion, action, even some humor and romance, that the movie never grows old. Scenes such as Faramir's ride towards Osgiliath and death, the charge of the Rohiram upon Pelennor fields, the last battle in front of the Black gate, while Frodo and Sam struggle up Mount Doom, just to name a few, are beautifully done and are implanted in my mind forever.
The Lord of the Rings trilogy, which ended with this rousing finale, has created a pop culture phenomenon that will no doubt last for many years to come. If you haven't seen by all means must buy or rent this DVD. If you have, then I suggest the same thing, buy it. You won't be sorry you did.",1090195200,4,3333,4.679727427597956

7274680,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The only author to captivate me more or as much as Frank Herbert is that great modern creator of mythos, J.R.R. Tolkein.  When I want science fiction that reads almost like Shakespeare, I turn to Herbert's Dune series.  When I want the legends of noble Kings and elves, I turn to the great Tolkein.
I am very picky about the art of the motion picture.  I am even more ridiculous in my standards in seeing a great work of literature adapted to the big screen.  I am usually completely let down by how often Hollywood displays its talent for butchering even the most straightforward of classics.
I was surprised.  Not only is this a great film on its own, it makes up for the sludge that was Peter Jackson's ""Two Towers.""  It is obvious in viewing this that Jackson stepped up the standards for his actors and for himself.  Unlike the modern Lucas films, Jackson seems to be able to learn from his mistakes.  Every slight mis-step found in the earlier Tolkein films is fixed here.  And it makes for grand viewing.
Thank you Peter Jackson.  You have delivered the goods this time and I am appreciative.  Amongst the mire of modern film, you have turned out something with impressive scenery and a royal nobility.  Thanks again.",1090022400,,1224,4.589861751152074

I have loved JRR Tolkien's, ""The Lord of the Rings"" since my early adulthood (from the early '80s), and Peter Jackson's big screen translation is the one I've been waiting for for more than twenty years. I saw ROTK more than a dozen times at the theatre, and each time I was moved to tears, it was just so beautifully done! My favorite scenes include: Gandalf and Pippin riding Shadowfax to the top of Minas Tirith - the Howard Shore score, for which I can't praise enough in this review, perfectly matched my growing sense of amazement at seeing just how BIG the city really was, and how high up it got - simply majestic; one of my most favorite scenes was the one where Pippin lit the first beacon of Gondor, and watching, stunned, as the incredible score, combined with the amazing aerial cinematography, swept me up and made my spirit soar as the call for aid travelled hundreds of miles through the night across the mountaintops! The hopelessness, sorrow, and unjustified doom in the faces of the women as they threw flowers before Faramir's path through the city before he and his men set out to attempt an utterly futile retake of Osgiliath. When Theoden rode before his men, clanging his sword against theirs and their berserker cry of ""DEATH!"" before charging into certain doom - just thinking about it makes my eyes water! Sam's heroic climb, carrying Frodo up Mt. Doom; the expressions on Gandalf's, Aragorn's, and Merry's faces as they watch Barad-dur fall and Mt. Doom explode; the deep sense of acknowledgment as Aragorn, Arwen, and the peoples of Gondor, Rivendell, and Rohan bow to the Hobbits at Aragorn's coronation; and the deep-felt sense of loss - for an end to the beauty the elves brought to Middle-earth, and for the final ending of the Fellowship, as the last ship left the shores of Middle-earth to take all the Ring Bearers (except one - Sam, who bore the One Ring for a little while) to The Deathless Lands, never to return.
I am truly puzzled by anyone who found this film boring (???), childish (???!!!), or anything other than an instant classic and a masterpiece that will light the world's screens for decades and longer. It would be interesting to know just what kind of movies *they* liked! ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" or ""2 Fast 2 Furious,"" perhaps. I enjoy a wide range of films, from Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, to To Kill A Mockingbird, Whale Rider, Casablanca, and even Fried Green Tomatoes - but ROTK (and FOTR and TTT) are in a class by themselves. See them. Buy them. And get as much of the collectible merchandise as possible! It's an investment in the future, I'm tellin' ya!  ;-)",1089936000,2,2691,4.629707112970712
7274682,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"I was impressed with the first two Movies especially the first and the second.  However, this one shifted between scenes with the development with the Kings return and final battle for middle earth and Frodo's problems with getting the ring to its final resting place.
This movie was also a lot 'darker' than the previous two.
The battle scene for this movie was extreme, a little too contrived, yet with 'magic' what do you expect.  I was very surprised how this image seemed a little like Star Wars in reverse.  The groups fighting each other good versus evil were somewhat switched.  For instance, all of the people on the good side were basically white (did anyone see people of color in this movie?)
Also, the creatures and humans combined to attack the city for it's final demise seemed like those fighting with the Jedi, mostly strange looking creatures.  Of course that is only a thought. Gandalf seemed a lot like Obiwan and Frodo fighting the evil of the ring seemed a little like Luke fighting the evil side of the force.
For those who read the Bible, you may get a hint of some 'Biblical themes.'  For instance the whole world gathers together to fight at the return of the king for the final battle of good and evil.  Sounds a little like the book of Revelation.  As well there is an army of dead souls for lack of a better name who come in and win the day as the city is attacked.  In Revelation, the King of kings, returns with 10s of thousands of angels to fight the final battle.
Interesting that Tolkien was a friend and contemporary of CS Lewis. His themes were a story to empasize good against evil and the overall struggle that leads to goods triumph.

""Use made-up languages and subtitles to hide how boring the dialogue would be in English"", Tolkien was a great studier of languages, and used his knowledge to compose 3 languages for the books, I find Elvish to be a beautiful language.

Create a love story out of thin air. Every moment of alleged suspense with another character and his army showing up out of nowhere and saving the day.
""The Lord of the Rings trilogy"" will have you pounded to your seat not for it's cinematic value but a tool for not taking any bathroom breaks. Because any bathroom breaks for an ""epic"" like this is sacrilage.
Peter Jackson, terrible schlock flimmaker turned Oscar winner out of nowhere may've crafted an overrated trilogy that passed under the radar of mediocrity and dared to be classic. Other trilogies or quadrilogies like ""Star Wars"", ""Indiana Jones"", ""Alien"", and even ""The Terminator"" and ""The Matrix"" have exhibited maker's creativity, ideals, conviction, and tribute to other films of past generations while each created cultural phenomenons.
""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy doesn't have any of it, it's nothing more than a blockbuster melodrama. Like J.K.K. Tolkien and George Lucas of right now, Peter Jackson indulges in a fabricated success that proves he thinks he's invincible. He is a filmmaker who hasn't improved and nurtured his skills through his cult and blockbuster days unlike Sam Raimi, James Cameron, and even John Carpenter. The Oscar for best director is a good debatable shield but ""Citizen Kane"" wasn't awarded the best movie of the year.
Flamer Kopf: Note that the title for the review is ""Review from a negative point of view"". As in a reverse psychology for a positive review. But since you got all sentimental, let me clarify. First of all, in my review I never attacked LOTR for being a greater success than The Matrix trilogies. I never really compared anything much about the success of the flim to the others. Second, I never nagged on about the trilogy getting that much Oscars. One the joke of the reverse review was ""terrible schlock filmmaker turned Oscar winner out of nowhere"" and used that as an insult throughout.

I and many other people thought from certain cues that the film ended in three different places, and that's where the length bothered me.

7274689,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Director Peter Jackson's final installment titled Return Of The
King will go down in cinematic history as not only the best one
in the glorious Lord Of The Rings trilogy, but it will be remem-
bered by critics and audiences as one of the greatest screen epics for the ages that achieved an impossible task. Director
Peter Jackson more than achieves the task of expertly crafting
J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings trilogy into an adaptable film series, he also creates one of the best screen epics of all
time. The story continues with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Samwise
Gamgee (Sean Astin) on their quest to Mordor to destroy the one
Ring that when anyone hangs onto it for a long time, they end up
getting addicted to it's power. Helping them is the distrustful
Gollum (Voiced by Andy Serkis, who just like in the last adventure Two Towers, creates a two dimensional CGI character).
Gollum (A.K.A. Smeagol) feels betrayed by Frodo, whom he calls
Master, so he goes back to his old ways by joining forces with
his alter ego Gollum to get rid of Frodo and Samwise. Meanwhile,
other members of the broken Fellowship, Aragorn (Viggo Morten-
sen), elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-
Davies), and white wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) regroup with
two other members of the Fellowship, the two hobbits Pippin
(Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan) to join forces as they
in seperate elements of the story fight in the battle at Minas
Tirith, which would lead up eventually to the last stand of
Sauron and his orcs, who are the demonish team he is leading.
Just like it's first two predecessors Fellowship Of The Ring, and The Two Towers, Return Of The King is not just a fantasy, it
is an epic with a great amount of substance and a great amount
of scale. Another similarity is the three hour and a half running time seems to fly by as viewers become intrigued by the
this beautiful and sweeping adventure. Unlike the last two Mat-
rix films which ended with a bore, this trilogy not only ends
with a bang, but director Peter Jackson, aside from delivering
throughly exciting action sequences, which are in two words
fantastic and phenominal, he also gives us a fascinating and
engrossing human story about friendship: how friendship reunited
Frodo and Samwise to complete their journey to destroy the ring.
Another element was at the beginning of the climactic battle
when Gimli said I never thought I would die with an elf and Legolas said what about a friend and Gimli implied that he is
happy to be friends with an elf. The third one is when Pippin and Merry reunite at the end of the major battle involving the
death of the Nasguil. They depicted that to show how to some
extent the whole war they are battling in Middle Earth is reuni-
ting everybody to form into one whole fellowship together and win the war that is so overwhelming to the inhabitants of Middle
Earth. Family: Faramir (David Wenham) gets betrayed by his
greedy father Denethor (John Noble), who always thought his older brother Boramir (Sean Bean, who died in Fellowship Of The
Ring) was the favorite. Another one is when Eowyn (Miranda Otto)
promises to take care of her uncle Theoden (Bernard Hill) but he
says that he is dying and implies to take on his legacy. Courage: When every warrior in Middle Earth gathers together to
fight the final battle.
Another one of my favorite action fantasy epics. This one just
like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Almost Famous, Band Of Bro-
thers, the previous LOTR films, Master And Commander, and Lost
In Translation delivers what it promises. This movie won all the
eleven oscars it was nominated for, and richly or should I say
more than deserved them all. It richly and more than deserved it's best picture oscar also. Peter Jackson wows us with exper-
tly choreographed and throughly awesome action sequences that rank up with the last two Lord Of The RIngs films, Saving Private Ryan, the films of Akira Kurosawa, and BRaveheart. It also contains a richly detailed plot that was sadly missing from
most action films of the 1980's and the 1990's. The cast is out-
standing: Viggo Mortensen brings heroism to his role of Aragorn,
Orlando Bloom makes the most of his supporting role as Legolas,
John Rhys-Davies provides the comic relief as Gimli, as does Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan as Pippin and Merry. Miranda Otto shines with her poignant performance as Eowyn and best of all, she even gets to fight during a battle. ELijah Wood and Sean Astin bring a considerable amount of humanity and heroism to their roles, just like Tobey Maguire did with his Peter Par-
ker role in Sam Raimi's Spider Man. Ian McKellen plays Gandolf
with enthusiasm like usual and Cate Blanchett's wonderful perf-
ormance as Galadriel represents a beautiful angel from heaven.
Special mention must also go to Australian actor Hugo Weaving,
who is just awesome as Elrond that he even tops his second and
third best performance's, which was his performance in Proof and his awesome role as bad guy Agent Smith in The Matrix. Another one is Liv Tyler, who is just beautiful and gorgeous as
Elrond's daughter Arwen. Again just like Cate Blanchett's Gala-
driel, she closely resembles a beautiful angel from heaven.
All in all, a milestone of cinema and a tour de force from start
to finish. I am a big fan of action movies and Peter Jackson
joins up there in the ranks with legendary action directors: Akira Kurosawa, Sam Peckinpah, John Woo, James Cameron, and
Steven Spielberg.

7274690,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"This is a well-constructed film that does its best to hold true to the spirit of the novels.  Producing a film that follows the written word exactly would have been impossible.  Therefore, Peter Jackson et al. have succeeded in making the best film adaptation of the revered series that we will see in our lifetimes.
The scenery is gorgeous and the acting is solid.  I have to give special kudos to Sean Astin (Samwise Gamgee).  He will not win any awards, but he truly brought Samwise to life.
The film's only drawback is the long ending.  The goal was obviously to stick close to the book.  However, it seems that the editors would have done well to make an earlier end and leave some other important footage in the final theatrical release, e.g. at least some sighting of Saruman.
However, the epic stands completed, and perhaps the most deservingly successful epic of our time.  Should any of Tolkien's other work be brought to the silver screen, I hope that it is as tasteful and worthwhile as these three films.
Note that very few people found the negative reviews helpful, relative to the overwhelmingly positive response.  Note also that this phenomenon occurs irrespective of how many times the same person posted a negative review and irrespective of how many non-creative modifiers (e.g. ""festering"") and masked obscenities  have been used.
If you believe in sitting down and being entertained by the art of film, this movie is worth buying.  If you have read the book and have been too skeptical to get to the theater, this one is worth your time.  If only twelve-year-olds like this movie, then twelve-year-olds are a lot smarter than many ""viewers"" estimate.",1089331200,3,1672,4.831578947368421
7274691,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"""Return of the King"" has to be viewed for what it is: one-third of a grand epic that stretches across vast panoramas of space and time. I've never read the Tolkien books, but to me the final installment of this epic film trilogy pulls the whole story together and makes it work better than any of the three segments does on its own.

I like this movie a lot, and will watch it again, but I do think it would have worked better if it had ended with the crowning of Aragorn and his speech to the assembled multitude. The 15-20 minutes after that seemed anti-climactic, and left me wondering: ""Why DID Frodo sail off with the Elves?""

 I suppose diehard Tolkien fans would have screamed and moaned if the movie had ended earlier, but I thought it made the whole thing a wee bit too long and didn't add to the story. Heck, they could have put the last scenes on the ""extra features"" disc, for those who wanted to see them.

That said, I still give this movie 4 stars, and would urge people to see the whole trilogy for maximum understanding and enjoyment!",1089244800,,1051,4.346938775510204

Several people I know who had not read the books could not follow the screenplay at all.  Upon further reflection, I realized that although the action scenes were Epic and overwhelming in their intensity, they did nothing to allow you to glimpse into these characters as they were created in Tolkein's books nor did the dialogue allow you to follow the plot as it advanced.  There was not a failure in the epic quality -- there was a failure of genuineness -- if it had hit the mark -- even those who had not read the books would have understood and been able to follow the movies.",1089244800,9,688,4.317829457364341

7274695,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Like Peter Jackson (or whoever it was) said, ""In this film, every character has to face their ultimate challenge."" This is very true. Aragorn has to learn that he must take responcibilities as a king, Frodo must destory the 'One Ring' before it destorys him. It's all a very high special effects film, but lucky for Peter, it didn't go too far. This movie will capture your imagination and make you wonder if there really was a middle earth, if there really was 'one ring to rule them all', if there were really orcs and wizards and...well you get the picture.
  The story continues as Frodo and his companion Sam travel to Mt. Doom to destory the One Ring that has started to unfold an undestoryable evil. I don't know if most people realize it, but Sam was actually the one thing keeping Frodo from turning back. And without Sam, Frodo wouldn't have made it anywhere with just Gollum. Speaking of which, Gollum (as you know) has a split personality. One side is the kind, 'mustn't hurt master' Smeagol. The other half is the 'precious' side other known as Gollum. But since everyone...especially Frodo, knows the power of the ring, it takes over Gollum and makes him...well...Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimili, Gandalf, and all the other important/half important people must defend the city of Minas Tirith. Reason being is because...well you watch it for yourself and see why. At first, I didn't really know why either, but that's why I watched the movie again.
  The one thing I didn't really appreciate that well is that Gimili and Legolas and Eyown's (or however you spell it) brother (whatever his name is) don't have much of a say in anything...especially Gimili. If you watched the first and second LOTRs, you would notice that they all each talk about the same as the main characters (Aragorn, Gandalf, King Theoden). But in the third one, they really don't talk at all. Mainly because it's centered on the main people in the movie, Aragorn, Gandalf, Frodo and somewhat Sam. But the special effects, the tearjerking scenes, and the breathtaking music really make up for it, to me at least. I don't think any other director, other than Peter Jackson, could have captured such a famous, epic book into an epic, 12 Academy Award winning movie. You should listen to the critics on this movie, it's a must see..if you haven't already seen it.

P>S>If you've seen the movie...listen up, because if you haven't seen it, you won't understand what I am about to say/type/whatever. I didn't notice this at first but when I did, I was surprised. Well, in the beginning of the film, when Merry and Pippin are singing their little drunken heads off, watch the guy that gets the drink spilled on. If you'll look at him and some old lady a couple of people to his right...or left, you'll see that they're not really looking at Pippin and Merry. Which means that Pippin and his drunk friend aren't really there. I guess it was computerized so they would look short. Probably a green screen.
  Second, and last, of all, when Aragorn and King Theoden and everyone else reach that camp place in the film with that mountain with those green, dead guys, watch how Argorn looks into the cave. As you can tell, he is looking (or at least thinks he's seeing) somthing. I looked too but didn't see anything...that is until I bought the movie. If you look really close while is shows the cave and the movie is playing, you'll see the leader of the green ghosts that Aragorn comes across when they enter the cave thing. Here's another way to do it: Right before Gimili comes along and tells Aragorn, ""Let's find some food."" (when the camera is on the cave entrance for the last time at the last second or whatever), pause the movie to where it still shows the screen. Now look closly and you might see it a little better. Or you can just put that scene in slow motion to see if you can see the ghost...wow that was confusing.
  If you already knew about this, then congrats, you knew something I didn't know about the movie. But if you didn't know it until now, then I guess I helped you out now didn't I?",1088899200,,4163,4.446920052424639
7274696,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"This is a very good movie, one that reflects Tolkien's book with great accuracy, but I cannot help compare it with the other two episodes and come to the conclusion that ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"" were better productions. I think that the Oscar won for Best Picture was an award given more based on the merits of the whole production than on those of just the movie itself. Even though I have the extended DVDs for the first two movies in the series, and enjoyed the long versions, in the case of ""The Return of the King"" I found even the regular version to be overextended at some points. This happened to me mostly in the parts dealing with Frodo's and Sam's journey to Mordor.
The movie starts presenting the story of how Smeagol came across the ring and lost his mind becoming Gollum. He then lost the ring when Bilbo stole it from him. This story is briefly described in ""The Lord of the Rings"", but for those of you who want to know the details, ""The Hobbit"" is your book. Now Gollum is guiding Frodo and Sam to Mordor and is having an internal fight with his Gollum personality, trying to decide whether to help the hobbits or misguide them and try to steal the ring from them.
The rest of the group is in Isengard, where Sarunam has been beaten and has remained trapped in his tower. Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the rest of the fellowship are celebrating but worried about the lack of news from Frodo. But they also have to face a pressing issue, Sauron is moving his army to destroy Minas Tirith, and their only hope is to get the King to summon the different races of Gondor and defend the main city in that area.
Except for the criticism mentioned above, I enjoyed the movie a lot. The magnitude of this production is breathtaking, and every little detail is considered and taken care of. The whole crew does an amazing job in terms of acting. I have enjoyed the performances of Elijah Wood for quite some time now, and he did not disappoint me in this case either. I also have to give excellent marks on the depiction of two of my favorite characters in the story, Legolas and Gimli, which are shown and act just as I imagined them.",1088812800,,2176,4.401985111662531
7274697,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"I planned to write a philippic showing why this film is even worse than the first two, but I don't have to. Others have done it, and done it very well. I invite you to consult the admirable 2-star reviews by Micah Sisk (June 18) and bobsacamento (May 21). They speak truth.
I will instead devote a few lines to observations on some of the more absurd contents of the pile of tripe that is ""Return of the King"".
The film won many Oscars, but it should receive more. Among them:
(1) For Best Horizontal Acting: Frodo Baggins. As I remarked in my review of The Two Towers, Frodo's specialties are falling down and opening his eyes very wide. While nothing in ROTk quite equals his famous belly-flop/fainting fit into the Dead Marshes, the cumulative effect of his tumbles and stumbles and moonlike eyes is quite good here. His apotheosis is the scene where he is wrapped in a spidery cocoon. Though he be silent and albino, his horizontality and huge eyes excite our admiration. (And here too we see how the Great Director improves on the mere author: Tolkien's Frodo grows constantly in heroism and leadership. Jackson's Frodo gets better and better at falling down.)
(2) For Military Tactics: Theoden. Faced with huge mumakil (elephants), against which cavalry is useless but bows are useful, the King of Rohan orders his exhausted riders into a nice tight formation--presumably so they will be easier for the mumakil to step on--and charges, while his horse archers have no time to help. But I must admit that Faramir could also compete for this award, since he uses cavalry to charge a pile of rubble impervious to horsemen and defended by archers. (Rohan and Gondor badly need Jeb Stuart or Marshal Murat.)
(3) For Plagiarism: Peter Jackson. I suggested in my review of The Fellowship that the movie PJ really wanted to make was Braveheart, and ROTk strengthens that belief. For instance, the scene where Aragorn exhorts his men to fight has already been done by William Wallace in the Mel Gibson film. The chief difference is that what Wallce says is inspiring, whereas Aragorn's words are drivel. (One could also point out that Mel Gibson actually looks and acts like a heroic leader, while what's-his-name in ROTk has so little charisma that you wonder if anyone (other than girls in their early teens) would follow him out of a burning building, let alone into a battle.)
(4) For Comedy: Denethor. This is a surprise. I assumed that Gimli would clinch it after his side-splitting antics in Atrocities I and II. But no--PJ made Denethor a real hoot. He hides in his palace peeking out the window at the city he purports to command, he stuffs himself with goodies while his son is leading that idiotic cavalry charge, he douses himself with quarts of oil, and then he entertains us with the Ritual Fire Dance. When the Human Fireball catapulted off the table, out the door, through the city, and launched himself into space, I nearly died laughing. (Denethor also threatened to eclipse Frodo by falling down so nicely when Gandalf beat him up, a scene made even more believable by the Guards of the Citadel standing there doing nothing while the White Bully is whacking their liege lord with a stick. Then everyone obeys Gandalf without hesitation. Well done, PJ.)
Finally, I want to condemn PJ's inability to avoid excess. No Hollywood hype, no opportunity to paint the lily, is neglected. For instance, it is not enough that Gollum get the ring by biting off Frodo's finger, then fall into the Cracks of Doom. Oh no. It was enough for Tolkien, but not for the Great Director. Instead, let's have Gollum get the ring after a big fight, then have Frodo get it back after ANOTHER big fight where he knocks Gollum into the abyss. (This misses the whole point about Gollum's very existence, by the way--but what point does PJ not miss in all three books?) THEN we'll have Frodo hanging by his fingernails, to be rescued by Sam. Can't PJ see how idiotically and absurdly excessive this is?
Well, all right. PJ masssacred Tolkien--possibly because, as Messrs. Sisk and bobsacamento suggest, he wasn't smart enough to understand the books. I nonetheless want to close on an upbeat note. Certainly PJ has done three things that are positive and good:
First, he had Aragorn wash his hair before the coronation. Finally! (It would have been embarrassing to watch the crown just slide off....)
Second, he has aided the prosperity of his homeland. New Zealand can be grateful to its native son. Tourism will flourish even more than before. Kiwis can show LOTR Pilgrims their beautiful country, and proudly point out all the spots where PJ ruined Tolkien's book.
Finally, Peter Jackson has proved, decisively, the superiority of the pen to the camera. The greatness of J.R.R. Tolkien's accomplishment is made clear by comparing what was done by the quiet scholar, in his spare time, with a pen, with what was done by the egomaniacal film-maker, professionally, with millions of dollars and thousands of assistants. The books will still stand as a monument to imagination and inspiration when the Great Director's meretricious travesty has been forgotten amidst the next wave of even-wider Wide Screens, even-specialer Special Effects, and even-dumber Dumb Dialogue.

7274698,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I never really got into the LOTR movies up until about 6 months ago when my girlfriend and a bunch of friends and people I know constantly insisted that it was such a great movie that I finally decided to watch the first two that were out on DVD. After the first one I found a new respect for a genre I grew out of (or thought I grew out of) in middle school, and couldn't wait to see the next one. After seeing The Two Towers I was hooked and started preaching the movies to people who hadn't seen it. I compared Two Towers to the powerfulness of Braveheart. I believe the movies have an underlying message that is very strong that anyone can relate to. The plan was to see the first two on DVD a.s.a.p and to see Return of the King in theatres before it was too late. So I went and saw it the last month it was out in mainstream theatres (and was still sold out!)and was amazed. The trilogy not only had unbelievably deep music, great characters that get built up nicely and you feel as if you know them personally (despite what a few other reviewers who apparently weren't paying attention due to their short attention spans have said)UNBELIEVABLE ACTING from great actors, great special effects and a great plot that has worked great in each of the movies. My hat is off to Peter Jackson for a great translation of the books and to New Zealand for providing and amazing backdrop for these movies to take place. If you have seen the movies and didn't like them; see them again. If you haven't seen the movies due to it seeming a little too nerdy, go give these movies a chance.

7274702,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"I have to totally agree with other reviewers who criticize this movie for its length.  The fact is, even though our kids would love this move if it were FIVE hours long, three+ hours is too long for a parent to sit through a children's movie.  I don't mind spending time with my kids, in fact we've spent longher than this playing leggos many times.  But watching aliens and wizards and pixies mincing around flogging eachother with rubber swords is a totally passive, non-interactive activity, and it's unreasonable to expect parents to be willing to do it for more than an hour and a half, two hours tops.
But I am giving it three stars because I sort of enjoyed it.  Part of me likes the whole dungeons and dtragons motif, probably the same part that still likes to play leggos!  I don't need every movie I see to be Schindler's List.  I'll go see a Finding Nemo, a Toy Story, or even a Lord of the Rings as a treat to my kids.

7274707,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"For those of you who read my reviews, for the last two years I have reviewed the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies once the DVD cames out so I could review both. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" came out earlier than the others, maybe because it won Best Picture at the Oscars this year, but I am still going to review both the movie and the DVD. I could start off by saying this is one of the greatest movies of all time, and it is the best of the three. The DVD is loaded with special features, but it could have more, and the features were not satisfying. The movie is visually stunning, filled with special effects, but some of the dialouge is corny, and certain speeches could drag on for a while. The musical score isn't genius, and didn't earn the Oscar for it three years in a row, but it does have a good theme, played during the battle sequences. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" is a great finale for a trilogy that started with a little dull, but ended grand.
The movie starts off with Smeagol, a hobbit, whose discovering of a very powerful ring, caused him to turn into a creature named Gollum, who has a good side and a bad side, both telling him to do different things. Gollum is helping the hobbits Frodo and Sam to destroy the ring many years later, by bringing it to Mount Doom where it was made. Frodo intends on destroying it, but Gollum has plans of death. Meanwhile, other hobbit Pippin has found something that makes Sauron think he is in possession of the ring, causing the wizard Gandalf to bring him to safty. They go to Gondor where Gandalf learns about Frodo's quest and how he isn't dead. Orcs under control of the Dark Lord are coming to destroy the city, and warrior Aragorn, elf Legolas, and dwarf Gimli set out to get the dead to help the people. King Theodon goes to Gondor with an army, and orders his neice Eowyn to stay behind. She dresses up as a man, and takes Pippin's friend Merry to fight in the battle. Finally, Aragorn's true love Arwin, who is an elf, wants to be a mortal instead of the ability to be immortal, so she could be with Aragorn. The war is only in the beginning of the end, and the fight begins.
""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" did not deserve the Oscar for Best Picture, a statue that should have gone to ""Mystic River,"" but it was a great movie to watch visually, but the acting and the dialouge is nothing to rave about. It won a total of 11 awards, but it doesn't mean that it earned them all.
The DVD is pretty good. It has alot of stuff, but the good in dept making of stuff is going to be on the December release of the extended version, with about 45 minutes of scenes not in the theatre release inserted into the movie, with a new score. The DVD has three ""in-dept"" making ofs called ""A Director's Vision,"" ""A Filmmakers Journey"" and a National Geographic special about the movie. It has featurettes that first made an appearence on the ""Lord of the Rings"" website, only six of them on this DVD. It has the trailer and television commericals. Finally, it has a look at the ""Lord of the Rings"" video game, which is coming soon.
This is the longest of the movies, at a total of 200 minutes, which is a little over three hours. People say that movies like ""Troy"" and ""The Passion of The Christ"" are violent, and those are only Rated R. This is rated PG-13, and it is the most violent PG-13 movie I have ever seen, even more violent than ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.""
To end my final review on the ""Lord of the Rings"" DVD's, I have to say that as one big movie, it is a masterpiece. I was not a fan of the first movie, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" only giving it four stars. The final two were great, at five stars, and these movies cannot be remade, because they are one of a kind. The special effects are a wonderm and no trilogy of movies can compare to this. Not ""The Matrix"" movies, and not even the ""Austin Powers"" movies. This is a great movie, and if they ever re-release it, go see it because it is better in the theatres.
ENJOY!
Rated PG-13 for intense epic battle sequences and frightening images.",1088035200,4,4146,4.236111111111111
7274708,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"My personal favourite was Two Towers (the second one).  At first I thought The Return Of The King was less than perfect - certain aspects about the ending sort of drove me nuts, fading in and out and such, but once I watched it again and knew that was coming, the story itself was more easily digested.
I'm 27, and not sure why anyone would assume this to be a child's movie.  Personally, I don't think a child of 8 or 9 should watch something like this unless they're particularly mature.  The movie has its share of violence for one, and for another, there's a lot more to the story than just dwarves and elves running around smacking rubber-masked creatures.  Fantasy and Sci-Fi movies are an excellent escape from the mundane for both young and not-as-young alike (assuming they're into that sort of thing).  And, despite all the makeup and screaming, many of them actually have moral and/or spiritual teachings in them.  The LOTR trilogy is one outstanding piece of work.  John Jackson gets my applause for bringing to the big screen one of the greatest stories ever written.  The ability to hold such a story together for nine hours is admirable to me, and even better was the fact that it was humourous, gross, loud, soft, tender, sad and thought-provoking all in one set of movies.",1087948800,2,1289,4.647577092511013
7274709,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"Like the other movies in this series this suffers chiefly from being too long. The entire saga, whilst taken from three fairly long books, has been transferred to the screen in a fashion that just does not require this amount of time. For example, how in a movie that lasts over 3 hours do we manage to completely avoid seeing Christopher Lee's Saruman? Instead we get a tree dictating what happened and are rewarded for this cut with a truly dull end sequence that just drags on and on. They couldn't give two minutes to Saruman?
Unlike the previous two movies there are moments of genuine excitement in this one, as if sitting through the first six hours allowed them to ground all the elements well enough to actually get on with telling the tale. The CGI feels less intrusive and the acting is largely good.
Unfortunately, the grand combat sequences are plagued with acts of strategic stupidity never before seen on film. Why do Faromir and cohorts wait for half the invading orc army to pass them thus being trapped in the middle? Why charge a herd of oliphants? Hoping to scare them were they? Why not circle around them and attack from behind? You've got horses, it won't take too long. And what on middle-earth suggested to Aragorn that taking all his bests fighters to be surrounded by an orc army was a good plan? Ok, he's intending to create a diversion but why not keep a few choice fighters back if you have no intention of nor chance of winning this particular fight? What are you going to do if your diversion is wasted? I guess in middle earth no one had heard of Thermopylae. At least the Spartan diversion allowed the bulk of the Greek army to escape to fight another day. Aragorn's diversion is forcing a conclusion now. I think I'd be on that 'second' last (as in last for the second time) elf ship out with a king like that.
However forgiving I am about these sequences, and they are fun if illogical, ultimately the lack of a real villain is telling. I'm afraid I just can't get that enthused about an enemy with less presence than an anorexic troll with a magpie complex. The spider is far and away the best 'baddie' in the show. Evil lighthouses just don't work.",1087948800,3,2186,4.508816120906801
7274710,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I feel that J.R.R. Tolkien would have been immensly impressed with Peter Jackson's brilliant adaptaion of the entire trilogy. Having read the books many times, I found myself feeling that Peter Jackson read my mind, and created the Middle Earth which I have always imagined.
 Given the complexity of the material, and the expectations of Tolkien's fans, The Return of The King, in conjunction with the preceeding two films, is quite simply the most masterful screen adaptation of a work of literature yet seen.",1087862400,4,510,5.071428571428571

7274713,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"(originally written Dec 18, 2003)
Last night I was witness to one of the greatest feats in motion picture history. The Lord Of The Rings:The Return of The King is perhaps one of the greatest films ever made, and is in fact the best film of the last fifteen to twenty years.
Peter Jackson and crew deserve every accolade that is being thrown upon them. If he does not win best director at this year's Oscars, the Academy should be disbanded.
The final chapter of the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, ""Return Of The King"" follows our heroes as they continue on their separate journeys in the quest to save Middle Earth. Frodo and Sam continue to press on into Mordor in an effort to destroy the ""One Ring."" Gandalf heads to the white city of Minas Tirith, with Pippen in tow, to warn the steward of Gondor of an impending orc attack on the city. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Merry, join the forces of King Theoden of Rohan in preparations for the coming war to save Gondor.
The genius of the film is not only apparent in the special effects and amazing battle sequences, but - in an even more profound manner - in the ever present themes of human existance that are woven into the film. Courage, despair, ever-lasting love, unrequited love, joy, honor, duty, reponsibility, determination, hope, sorrow, fear, pain, rejection, deception, greed, friendship; little moments featuring quiet exchanges between characters coupled with triumphant overcoming of incredible odds.
All of these are on display, and more often than not, I felt the emotions right along with the characters. It's one thing for my girlfriend to become uncomfortable while watching a sitcom character go through a sticky situation, it's quite another for me to be brought to tears while watching what is ostensibly an fantasy-action film.
But, then, that's just it; ""Return Of The King"" is more than just another fantasy film, it is the ultimate allegory for life itself. To do the best with the time we're given, however trying they might be. To accept our responsibilites, however daunting or scary they might be. To fight oppression in whichever form it takes. To celebrate the things that matter most in this life. And having the wisdom to figure out exactly what those things are.
If you haven't yet seen this film, then stop reading, and head to the theater immediately. We've been quite fortunate these past several Christmases, enjoying an annual gift from our friends in New Zealand. I for one will miss the family tradition that has sprung up over the last three years. It will most likely be some time before another film requires the amount of pre-planning among my family members that ""Return Of The King,"" and it's predecessors, ""The Fellowship Of The Ring,"" and ""The Two Towers"" had made necessary.
All hail ""The Return Of The King,"" a reminder (as well as the justification) of why we all go to the movies in the first place.",1087603200,8,2912,4.779761904761905
7274714,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"I would like to ask director Peter Jackson one specific question: ""What ever--in your wildest dreams--made you believe YOU could tell this story better than J. R. R. Tolkien?"" I'd like to hear his answer because, despite my initial good rating of Fellowship of the Ring, by the time I finished watching all three films, I became completely convinced that Jackson has no clue why Tolkien's masterpiece works. He simply has no concept of the underlying forms and devises that make this enduring tale so alive, so vital and so meaningful. For Jackson, lacking this basic conceptual understanding, has re-written the great masterpiece as nothing more than a gung-ho, action-packed, Thrills-Spills-N-Chills romantic adventure that would more happily fit between the covers of a gaudy graphic novel than those of a work of renowned literature. He gives us the fundamental look of Middle Earth. He gives us cool computer graphics and the amazing elf-dude surfing down stairs on a shield and surfing up the side of an elephant the size of Chartres Cathedral. He even gives us the raw skeleton of the original story's plot . . . But where is the rich emotional content? Where is the complexity and subtlety of plot and character? Where is the character development? Where is the mystery, the charm, the poetry, the music or the sense of rich history so vital to making this world seem real? It's missing. All of it is missing.
And what we're left with is a soulless bunch of good ol' fun--a roller coaster ride with heroes dropping off cliffs only to emerge unscathed a few scenes later; precarious collapsing bridges; narrow escapes from certain doom, and a bunch of ""Phew! That was close!"" clich movie moments. Yee-ha. It's fun cinema if you're not interested in anything else. I mean if you'd really rather watch Indiana Jones than The Seven Samurai, then hooray for Peter Jackson. But, and this is the shame of it, the film could have passed beyond just plain fun, and perhaps even into the realm of the sublime, if some of Tolkien's charm and wonder had been allowed to percolate through the adrenaline pumped extravaganzas Jackson gives us.
When a film is translated to screen there is always discussion about how much of a debt the director owes to the author of the work he is interpreting. In general it seems to be agreed by movie critics that the end justifies the means. If you make a good movie then the amount of mucking around with the source material is, well, immaterial. But how much of this should we really accept? There are some really incredible films we can look to for an answer. Take Throne of Blood by Kurosawa for example. I can think of no film that deviates more from its source material and yet stays so unerringly true to the original's spirit and intent An adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth, Throne of Blood is very possibly the best adaptation of The Scottish Play ever filmed. That, even though it is set in medieval Japan--that's right, it's a samurai film. And though a lot of the dialog is directly adapted from the play, it is in no way filmed in Shakespeare's stylistic verse--the very language so revered by we Westerners is missing. It is, however, unerringly faithful to the original's intense psychological content and to its characters in terms of their development, motivations and personalities, all of which Jackson is equally unfaithful too in his Lord of the Rings trilogy.
And perhaps we should demand higher standards for screen adaptations of literary classics. Would you accept a film adaptation of Dickens's A Christmas Carol wherein the pre-haunting Scrooge is portrayed as not such a bad guy after all? Maybe he tosses the paupers singing Christmas carols a few coins instead of brusquely shoving them into the street with a harsh ""Be off with you!"" And then maybe during his haunting we can see all kinds of great special effects and watch Scrooge very nearly get killed by the ghosts, but he escapes by the skin of his teeth only to be confronted by the next set of action-packed ghoulish adventures. Wouldn't that be cool? Or would it simply be crap because we've changed a story to appeal to a ""wider"" movie audience, a story that needed no change in the first place?
Look, a novel is a story. It relies on plot, character development, setting, language, emotional content and action to get its point across. So does cinema. There is no logical reason why a film cannot tell the same tale as a book. Any director who cannot do this either doesn't understand the original material or believes they can tell the tale better than the original author can. Or, I suppose they could also just want to leech off the fame of the source material, having no convincing tale to tell of their own. I further suppose that most directors translating books into film suffer from a combination of all of these, Jackson being no exception. If he had paid half as much attention to the story and character details as he did to the props, maybe we would have seen a film more worthy of bearing Tolkien's name. But, no, Jackson insists on giving us this testosterone-driven, quick-edit eye candy at the expense of any real content. And in so doing, Jackson is quite evidently milking the fame of Tolkien's work for as much fame and moolah as he can by jolting the pleasure centers of the un-read, cartoon-nurtured public's brains with syrupy romance, cliched serial-style cliff hangers and pubescent melodrama.
I read an interview of Peter Jackson in which he declared that the theatrical releases of LOTR are the ""definitive cuts"" and that he considers the special addition DVDs with additional scenes to be ""novelties for fans of the book."" Yeah, I thought so. Jackson has relegated Tolkien's source material to the status of novelty.",1087516800,18,5769,4.804828973843058
7274715,3,B00Z9YZRVE,At least this one had some entertainment value and good pacing except the dreadful 1/2 hour long epilogue (most of the theatre walked out 10 mins into that fiasco). Gollum was good again. Some good battles. Still way too sappy and hollywood folmulaeic. At least this one ended the damn  movies. Give me Krull anyday.,1087430400,,316,4.745454545454545

7274718,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The Return Of The King is the final part to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  It perfectly completes the trilogy of which the three films rank amongst the finest achievements in film history.  The film follows Frodo (Elijah Wood) and his trusty companion Sam (Sean Astin) through their ascent of Mount Doom to destroy the ring.  Meanwhile their friends face a final battle against Sauron's forces to defend Minas Tirith.  Aragon (Viggo Mortensen) must face his true calling as the King of men and Legalos (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are by his side to fight the Orc forces.  The battle scene is a visual masterpiece worthy of true epic stature.  Andy Serkis who brilliantly voices the creature Gollum gets some real face time in the beginning of the film as we see the origins of Gollum.  Ian McKellan is the films steady presence as Gandlaf and Liv Tyler and Miranda Otto bring beauty and strength to their roles of Arwen & Eowyn respectively.  The film has so many intricacies and brilliant performances that they are impossible to detail.  Behind all the amazing performances is the best performance of them all, director Peter Jackson's.  Mr. Jackson's work is as good as any director's work in history and when you take all three films as a whole, it probably is the greatest work any director has ever achieved.  The Return of the Kings was a big success Oscar night, sweeping all eleven categories it was nominated in including Best Picture and Director and tied Ben-Hur & Titanic for most Oscars for one film.  With the six awards the first two installments received, it is far and away the most honored film franchise in history.",1087344000,2,1653,4.76140350877193
7274719,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I am not going into a detailed description of this movie as I fell most will have seen it.  But, I was totally immersed in it and felt it one of the best pictures I have seen.  The acting was above great, the action supurb, and Jackson's directing beyond anything done by others.  This is a wonderful ending to the best series of movies ever made.  I read ""poohs"" at the special effects from National Geographic, but I found it vastly interesting and had enough sense to know that it was opinions of various historians and it just added to it all for me.  Well worth any money spent, I am waiting for the DVD extended version coming out later in the year...my gift to myself.",1087257600,,675,4.325396825396825
7274720,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Living overseas, I missed the big screen showing of Return of the King. The wait for the DVD was well worth it. Just as they did in the first two films, the producers, directors, cast, and crew did a fantastic job of bringing Return of the King from book to film.",1087171200,,263,4.176470588235294
7274721,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This was simply a great movie. I can watch parts of it again and again.
Acting: The acting was great. I cannot say anymore save to elaborate. In particular, Sean Astin's performance as he weeps over a ""dead"" Frodo was amazing; it made me cry, which is something i have never done in a movie. ""Don't go where I can't follow . . ."" Viggo Mortensen was, as always, great - ""I bid you STAND, MEN OF THE WEST!"" - and Ian McKellen gave life to the role of Gandalf, Elijah Wood to Frodo, and the rest of the cast. Orlando Bloom, whom I thought for a long time was a stupid chick magnet, is actually a fair actor.
Storyline: The plot is rushed at places, but that can be excused. I, for one, am willing to overlook the numerous plot changes when I step back and look at the big picture - only by changing the plot in places can a director successfully bring a long, complex book like ROTK to the screen. There were a few truly great lines: ""Go now and die in whatever way seems best to you!"", ""You will not touch him again!"", ""I go to my fathers, in whose mighty presence I shall know no shame"", ""There is no veil between me and wheel of fire!"" and ""Then let us be rid of it!"", and my favorite: ""That STILL only counts as one!""
Special effects: Mumakil. Need I say more? Seriously, though, the special effects were incredible. I cannot find anything that compares with the charging mumakil (oliphaunts), the brief fight scene between the Nazgul and the eagles, and the spectacular ride of the Rohirrim. Oh, and the Dead at the Pelennor fields. Another scene worthy of an Oscar alone was the lighting of the beacons. Ahh, the mountain views . . .
There are parts in this movie that made me want to scream in pure joy. The ride of the Rohirrim (""Forth Eorlingaaaaaas!""), with its great music and great dialogue, and its sense of triumph, was one of those parts. Then came the mumak attack, which blew my mind. Sam's timely arrival in Shelob's lair was yet another of those scenes.
As I said, there are more than a few changes fromt he book. Most of these were for the sake of time, and a few, like the parting of Sam and Frodo, were perhaps a little ill-advised but easily dwarfed by the otherwise great elements of the movie.
Some people don't like this movie. I can see why some fantasy-hater might not think it deserved all its Academy Awards (I'm not saying this hypothetical fantasy hater doesn't need to get a life), but they should at least appreciate the epic-ness, the fine score, and the wonderful acting.
One last thought: This is a movie that has great special effects, but it all is a backdrop for the human story that rumbles on throughout the trilogy. As I said, sometimes the plot is rushed, but one can only hope the extended version will straighten out the wrinkles and make this grand, wonderful, beautiful movie into what it could easily be.
Another final thought (this will be the last one): At first I thought the deletion of the Scouring of the Shire scene was a good thing, since that part seemed to just drag on the ending. But now I think about it, and it had some symbolism and themes that are not so easily thrown away. The movie works fine wihtout that scene, but if the extended DVD added it, I won't complain.",1087084800,4,3230,4.376039933444259

7274725,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"The virtues of this part of the trilogy are the same as the virtues of the first two parts. Superb acting, visuals, and of course Tolkien's story.
However, this last effort had too much action for action's sake. This left less time for in-depth dialogue. The interaction between characters was left to the minimum, lowest common denominator stuff. It is in this film especially that a bigger dose of Tolkien's wordiness would have been welcome. Less action, more talk. I suppose Jackson was unable to resist the temptation to try to compete in spectacle and unrestrained busy-ness with other contemporary action films. Pity. LOTR is so much more than that. Or it should be.
Also, the emotional peak of the film is the coronation of the king, and particularly his showing honor to the four hobbits. The two epilogues following this were not necessary. The ending therefore is strung-out to no good purpose.
These flaws could be fixed in the directors cut, but I doubt they will be. If Return of the King could be made more like Fellowship of the Ring, then this trilogy would be an unqualified success, and I would pronounce it the greatest epic film ever made. But they dropped the ball at the last. I think it was fatigue on Jackson's part. He lost sight of what he'd done in the first two that made them so magical.
Still, a trilogy must have an ending, even if it is somewhat flawed. I will wait with faint hope for the director's cut.",1086998400,3,1438,4.62109375
7274726,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"There has been much criticism about ""gratuitous"" use of CGI in the trilogy, apparently without understanding that its use created creatures and locations that simply don't exist in the real world. Smeagol/Gollum is the best rendered animated character in movie history; but it wouldn't matter if Antony Sirkis didn't give the animated image its physicality and personality. Smeagol/Gollum works, because Sirkis gives a brilliant performance expressing the character's fractured personality. There is no way the animators, or Peter Jackson, should be slammed for creating something never seen before in movies. Another brilliant use of CGI comes just after Faramir and his men try in vain to outrun the Nazgul: After Gandalf chases the Nazgul away the camera turns with a jerky motion to follow Gandalf on horseback, as if the cameraman was also on horseback, and we see Minas Tirith in the distance, across the plain. What impresses me is that the realism in the camera movement gives the impression that Minas Tirith is really in the distance, when in actual fact it has been created by special effects artists. The shot made me feel as if I was there on the plain with the other riders feeling the urgency of the situation. This was a CGI enhanced shot that was brilliantly conceived and executed to convey realism.
 However, none of the CGI elements would be worth a pixel if the actors didn't give humane, believable performances. For example, the Faramir-Denethor subplot, and the animosity between Sam and Gollum are wonderfully acted, and reveal the emotional core of the movie, which for me is love expressed as loyalty. Each of the performers does an excellent job of conveying the emotional centre of the character they play; and each character expresses their commitment to the concept of ""good"" or ""evil"" through their emotional connection to other particular characters. The CGI does not drown the emotional core of the movie, because the characters are so skillfully and emotionally portrayed. The entire trilogy is technically dazzling; but the story is driven by a wonderful ensemble acting performance.",1086912000,5,2119,5.159883720930233
7274727,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This film merits all the superlatives; 5 stars are frankly not enough. This edition of the DVD is probably going to be surpassed by the extended edition due at year's end, but by all means go for this DVD if you must have ROTK now; the sound, film quality and extras are outstanding quality and will keep you quite happy till Christmas, yess my preciouss.
The only quibble I might offer over Peter Jackson's choice not to film one ending from the book: the Scouring of the Shire, a rather bitter chapter in which the hobbits return to the Shire to find that Saruman had taken over, polluted and trashed the country, and that Merry and Pippin and Sam had to lead a revolution and fight the last battle of the War of the Rings in the Shire itself. Given that Prof. Tolkien hated what industrialization had done to the green England of his youth, it's worth re-reading this story, if only to appreciate that his environmentalism was strong even before there was such a word. Moral: if you don't have the Lord of the Rings book in your collection, get it. Prof. Tolkien left us a rich epic, and there was only so much Mr. Jackson could put on 11 hours of film.
But this is a minor footnote. I had wondered if the cinema would ever do Prof. Tolkien justice, and I must say that Peter Jackson has done so. Even in the Professor's mighty company, Mr. Jackson will not now be ashamed.

7274728,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"What can I say about Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy? The major reviews of ""The Return of the King"" all share a common feature: they seem to be pushing the boundaries of the English language to express what Jackson has achieved. It's as if they don't have words big or lavish enough to capture what he has done here. Words like ""monumental,"" ""colossal,"" and phrases like ""the film event of the millennium"" and ""a triumph, on par with 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Gone with the Wind'"" come from the pens of critics who do not hand out such praises lightly. I couldn't agree more.
Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings had a powerful effect on me when I first read it, and it remains my favorite book of all time (apart from the Bible). It was with trepidation that many fans of the book awaited Jackson's film version, but his translation of the 20th century's most popular book onto celluloid is, well, monumental. Just as there are few words to express the achievement, there are no words to express the horror that could have ensued had some other Hollywood directors managed to get the rights to these films.
I followed the production from the beginning on various websites, and it's almost sad now that the whole thing is finished. Jackson's vision of Tolkien isn't perfect by any means, and it is colored by his own perspective on the story, but it remains, nonetheless, the film event of the millennium. Tolkien-heads like me couldn't be happier about it.",1086825600,4,1462,4.648648648648648
7274729,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"some of the best action ever. there is also good music and a lot of extras, though many are not very interesting. The ending took too long but still left one of the most important parts out and sometimes the dialog got kind of geeky.",1086825600,,233,4.2
7274730,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"There has been much criticism about ""gratuitous"" use of CGI in the trilogy, apparently without understanding that its use created creatures and locations that simply don't exist in the real world. Smeagol/Gollum is the best rendered animated character in movie history; but it wouldn't matter if Antony Sirkis didn't give the animated image its physicality and personality. Smeagol/Gollum works, because Sirkis gives a brilliant performance expressing the character's fractured personality. There is no way the animators, or Peter Jackson,  should be slammed for creating something never seen before in movies. Another brilliant use of CGI comes just after Faramir and his men try in vain to outrun the Nazgul: After Gandalf chases the Nazgul away the camera turns with a jerky motion to follow Gandalf on horseback, as if the cameraman was also on horseback, and we see Minas Tirith in the distance, across the plain. What impresses me is that the realism in the camera momement gives the impression that Minas Tirith is really in the distance, when in actual fact it has been created by special effects artists. The shot made me feel as if I was there on the plain with the other riders feeling the urgency of the situation. This was a CGI enhanced shot that was brilliantly conceived and executed to convey realism.
  However, none of the CGI elements would be worth a pixel if the actors didn't give humane, believable performances. For example, the Faramir-Denethor subplot, and the animosity between Sam and Gollum are wonderfully acted, and reveal the emotional core of the movie, which for me is love expressed as loyalty. Each of the performers does an excellent job of conveying the emotional centre of the character they play; and each character expresses their commitment to the concept of ""good"" or ""evil"" through their emotional connection to other particular characters. The CGI does not drown the emotional core of the movie, because the characters are so skillfully and emotionally  portrayed. The entire trilogy is technically dazzling; but the story is driven by a wonderful ensemble acting performance.",1086825600,,2122,5.159883720930233

One a huge screen, there is so much action to swallow it's nearly impossible to digest it all. Those screeching flying Nazgul dinosaurs, ouchhhh!  While watching it for the first time at home, I saw things I don't remember from my theatre experience.  The small screen actually shows the eye things from a different perspective.  You are able to take in the entire screen at once.  I am not going to say it's like watching a different movie, but the same movie with subtle differences.

The third movie was an absolute let down. Why go to the effort of making this amazing book into an amazing movie only to re-write it and edit out parts that are essential to the core chemistry of the books. We live in a world of avant-twits. Peter Jackson should be ashamed to take something this great and re-constitute so he could sell it to all the freaks to lazy to read the book.,1086739200,11,560,4.242990654205608
7274734,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This third and final installment to Peter Jackson's cinematic interpretation of the Lord of the Rings is a triumph for all involved despite its flaws.  As Frodo, Sam, and Gollum approach Mordor in the attempt to destroy the ring, the kingdoms of man face brutal attacks that must be defended against all odds.  Especially compared to the second film, ""The Two Towers,"" the action is well-balanced and tightly portrayed, with only a few scenes lasting too long.  As with the others, the cinematography is captivating and even breath-taking at times.  The computer graphics are, except in one or two cases, successfully integrated, with the Orc army a phenomenal achievement with its individualized ""actors.""
Many of the movie's difficulties derive from the translation of the book to film.  The complicated nature of the story line and cast of characters cannot be easily shown with visuals, even three and a half hours of them, resulting in some confusing scenes and relationships especially for those unfamiliar with the books.  The biggest, and only inexcusable, flaw for me was directorial.  Jackson chooses an overly sentimental tone to ""end"" the film - four or five times.  The music gets jacked up, the camera shows tight close-ups of supposedly meaningful expressions, the screen fades out, and, oops, here comes another scene that goes through the same throes of sentimentality.  The result is akin to a symphony that sounds its big, ending notes, only to then return to the less dramatic middle of the movement.  These false endings get downright annoying, and the Hollywood-type treatment mars this otherwise spectacular film.
I still give this film five stars because of the remarkable achievement of bringing this story to dramatic life.  ""The Return of the King"" is the best of the trilogy with its nearly perfect balance of action and set-up, and with the ensemble acting really hitting its stride.  Do not see this film without having seen the others, as none stands well on its own.  This riveting epic will undoubtedly become a film classic.  Buy the DVD.",1086739200,5,2072,5.055882352941176

7274739,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The third installment of perhaps the greatest film trilogy of all-time, Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King draws the epic journey of the One Ring to highly-anticipated end.
 Director Peter Jackson displays his finest work to date, as the film flawlessly weaves in and out of different sub-plots while balancing action with dialogue to perfection. Jackson also takes his boldest stab at adapting the LOTR series by straying away from the novel's plot and dialogue more than the other two books. Jackson even took the liberty of adding a different beginning and end to the film.
 Viggo Mortensen stars as the Northern Ranger Aragorn, whose return to native Gondor is highlighted in the film's title. Although ROTK sets the stage for Mortensen's standout performance, he fails at times to be more eminent than the scenery. When he voices his climactic speech prior to the culminating battle of the movie, one becomes reminiscent of Mel Gibson's riveting performance in Braveheart. Unfortunately, Mortensen comes nowhere near to matching the Aussie star's electrifying deliverance.
 One of the better performances of the film, however, comes from Sean Astin, who plays Frodo's companion, Samwise Gamgee. Like Mortensen, Astin's character receives a lot more focus in ROTK, but he comes off leaving a lasting impression on the audience. Astin convincingly embodies the courageous and caring attributes of Gamgee so well, that the audience is able to connect with his character the most.
 While the acting had its ups and downs, the special effects were all around spectacular. The Battle of Pelennor Fields was a true visual achievement, as the armies of Rohan, Mordor, and the Dead clashed in one of the greatest battle sequences ever put on film. The special effects crew also did exceptional work in one particular scene, in which Aragorn summons the dead warriors of Gondor to fight for him. The phantasms of the cursed men were generated with such eerie detail that it intensified the atmosphere with haunting suspense. This suspense, however, was exceeded by the still uncertain fate of the ring.
  By the time of the film culminates, viewers are left with some sense of fulfillment, whether it be by viewing high intensity action sequences or finally knowing how the epic ends.  Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King fittingly caps off the extraordinary saga that has drawn more attention to the classic novels than Tolkien himself would have ever imagined. If you take away all the publicity, all the awards, all the money; and all the recognition the LOTR films have attained, you're still left with an appropriate tribute to Tolkien's legacy.",1086480000,,2658,5.068649885583524

7274744,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Okay, so I started reading JR Tolkein when I was 14, and have read the LOTR trilogy at least 20 times since (I'm 42 now).  I also managed to force my way through The Silmarillion once, The Hobbit a couple of times (my 12yo son is reading it now), but the various other short stories didn't engage me at all.  So .. I have to admit that, although I have loved the series, I am deeply disappointed at how much has been left out/changed etc.  Even little things that made me just say ""why oh why?"" like the struggle between Frodo and Gollum at the end of the movie.  That is just incorrect.  I don't have the book here with me, but I clearly recall that Gollum bit Frodo's finger, off, danced around crying ""my precious, my precious"", lost his balance, then plunged into the depths of Mount Doom.  What dramatic purpose did it serve for Frodo to struggle with Gollum?  Similarly, why was Arwen far too visible in The Fellowship .. and pretty much disappeared for the rest of the movie.  I won't go into how wrong it was to put her in the role of rescuing Frodo from the Ringwraiths!  Gosh, it makes me wish that I had millions and millions of dollars and could make about 5 movies - and include Tom Bombadill, and Glorfindel, and the VERY important scene between Gandalf and Saruman where Gandalf breaks Saruman's staff of council, showing that he has lost his power and Gandalf has taken his place.  The thing with the Palantir was just thrown in so messily - and having Treebeard say ""There is a wizard to deal with here"" and then ... wot, no confrontation!?  That was just plain weird.  Even my husband, who hasn't read the books, felt that something went astray there.  I also deeply regret that the Scouring of the Shires disappeared.  That was vitally important.  It truly evidenced how much changed the four Hobbits were by their journeying, and how they had matured and grown.  Their final confrontation with Saruman was excellent in the book .. entirely missing in the movie.  Ah well.  Still, beautiful scenery, good acting (although was I alone in being a little tired of Elijah Wood's ""constipated"" expression), fabulous sets and battles, and pretty good subtitles too.",1086307200,5,2178,4.583979328165374

7274746,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Return of the King is the final chapter of the Lord of the Ring trilogy which I think is the best of three movies. This movie is way too intense so that three and half hour is not enough. Peter Jackson is 100% loyality to the book, but I think there is something ""miss"" in the movie and the book. The end is too dramatic, because the fellowship only has one loss (Boromir). The other eight are survive. I always wonder why make the Fellowship of the Ring movie is so successful. The one main reason is when Gandalf falls into the shawdow and Boromir's death scene. Everybody can feel the emotion and grief in it. And that's make me wonder what if Merry's sacrifice at the Battle of the Pelennor Field? Pippen's sacrifice for save Gandalf or Aragon at battle of Blackgate? And even Frodo falls into the Mount Doom with Gullom?(because I don't believe you can grip something when you fight someone and falls). Then let Sam survive. Really, the end of the LOTR book is too perfect for 50's to 80's, but it looks too dramatic at modern day.
  For these of us who had read the LOTR books know that Sauron has 500,000 strong army, but men (Gonder and Rohan) only have less than 40,000 army. So when they have confrontation, you can't have all 6 main characters (Gandalf, Aragon, Gimli, Legolas, Pippen, Merry) survive from all three tough battle like siege of Gondor, Pelennor Field and Blackgate. Because people will not feel how tough and how important these battles are for main characters only if minor soliders died.

The director smoothly transitioned us back and forth between Frodo and Samwise's incredible trek to destroy the ring at Mount Doom and the fight of Arogorn for his throne and the destruction of Sauron. The battle scenes were unbelievable. The special effects were great. The number and types of creatures filled one with awe.

The softer ending with Sam's writing the final chapter of ""There and Back Again"" made it a little easier to come to the final conclusion that we all hate to see.

Thank goodness the Extended DVD will totally satisfy all us fans. However, even though I like 'all the endings' after seeing it over 5 times, I would rather have seen those cut out for the theatrical release and stick in the fight between Gandalf and Saruman as well as the Witch King confronting Gandalf and breaking his staff (which will be included in the Extended Version).
Anyway, I have to be honest, even though I enjoyed the movie the first time, I was a little disappointed in it because my expections were so high. However, now that I have watched it over 5 times, I totally understand now why it swept the Oscars and I now love this movie very much, but it's still my least favorite of the three. I can probably speculate that the extended version will raise my opinion of this movie considerably (as the other two films extended editions did).
I won't bother to recount the story because there are hundreds of descriptions already posted here. This movie was epic and grand, special effects were decent - but they did not overshadow the story (Hint! Hint! to George Lucas). My most favorite moments were Gandalf's ride to Minas Tirith, Lighting of the Beacons, the ""Oscar Moment"" of Faramir riding to his death as Pippin sings an incredible ditty to Denethor as he ravages cherry tomatoes like some starved beast. The beginning scenes of Frodo entering Shelob's lair was very well filmed, the comedy between Gandalf and Pippin was refreshing, the Witch-King's defeat by Merry and Eowyn was very good, the 'bull-dozer' charge of the Rohirim was phenominal. The Nazgul on the fell beasts grabbing men and throwing them to their death was horrifying. I guess I could go on, but those are my favorite moments. My main complaint was that the ""King"" and his friends Legolas and Gimli were very robbed of scenes. I know there are extended scenes of these 3 in the mountain caves of the dead, and I've heard that Aragorn will confront the Mouth of Sauron at the Black Gates in the EE.
So, basically, Yes, this is a very good movie, but more so than the other two films, I think this one has to be watched several times to really appreciate its greatness. I've read some very ridiculous criticisms of this movie here, like ""LOTR is a rip-off of ""Star Wars""... haha... HELLO!!! LOTR was written over 40 years ago - if anything was ripped off, it was Star Wars ripping off LOTR!!

However, now that I have watched it over 5 times, I totally understand now why it swept the Oscars and I now love this movie very much, but it's still my least favorite of the three.  I can probably speculate that the extended version will raise my opinion of this movie considerably (as the other two films extended editions did).
I won't bother to recount the story because there are hundreds of descriptions already posted here.  This movie was epic and grand, special effects were decent - but they did not overshadow the story (Hint! Hint! to George Lucas).  My most favorite moments were Gandalf's ride to Minas Tirith, Lighting of the Beacons, the ""Oscar Moment"" of Faramir riding to his death as Pippin sings an incredible ditty to Denethor as he ravages cherry tomatoes like some starved beast.  The beginning scenes of Frodo entering Shelob's lair was very well filmed, the comedy between Gandalf and Pippin was refreshing, the Witch-King's defeat by Merry and Eowyn was very good, the 'bull-dozer' charge of the Rohirim was phenominal.  The Nazgul on the fell beasts grabbing men and throwing them to their death was horrifying.  I guess I could go on, but those are my favorite moments.  My main complaint was that the ""King"" and his friends Legolas and Gimli were very robbed of scenes.  I know there are extended scenes of these 3 in the mountain caves of the dead, and I've heard that Aragorn will confront the Mouth of Sauron at the Black Gates in the EE.
So, basically, Yes, this is a very good movie, but more so than the other two films, I think this one has to be watched several times to really appreciate its greatness.  I've read some very ridiculous criticisms of this movie here, like ""LOTR is a rip-off of ""Star Wars""... haha... HELLO!!!  LOTR was written over 40 years ago - if anything was ripped off, it was Star Wars ripping off LOTR!!  I wish people would know what they are talking about before they make idiots of themselves!!",1086134400,,2694,4.608786610878661

While I don't think that the movies are completely as good as most will say, they are not nearly as bad as others will claim.  This is one of the greatest fantasy films of all time, in my opinion.  I liked this third installment just as good as the other 2.  The only things I didn't like were that the ending keeps dragging on and on for awhile, and, the evil wizard, Saramourn (if spelled correctly), is nowhere in the movie.
I don't know what one reviewer who calls himself IK was thinking when he watched the film.  The Return Of The King is not animated.

You can't seem to let it go. Peter Jackson did it again!!! I had no doubt this one would be great, but never did I think that I would like it better than the other two. If you have not seen it, you should. No matter how many times you see it it will almost always have the same effect on you. I've seen it five times and have not gotten bord yet.

7274758,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The third and final part of the trilogy, Peter Jackson and the cast didn't disappoint. Will Frodo be able to overcome all the challenges in his way and destroy the ring? Will Aragorn take his seat on the throne? Will Middle Earth survive, or will Sauron get the ring and take over?
My only qualm is that I'll be forced (by my addiction to the movie and everything LOTR!) to buy the extended version once it comes out. If you can wait a few more months, I'd recommend it! The ""extras"" on this DVD will be nothing compared to what you'll get on the extended version (if the two past movies serve as any example).",1086048000,2,610,4.3130434782608695
7274759,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"I'm glad I didn't spend the $ and 201 minutes of my life to see this painfully ponderous tome in the theatre. As it is, I resent the rental fee but I asked for it. This could have been good at a two hour running time. Do the film makers think we have bladders of iron? It is troubling that Frodo's journal has blank pages for Sam to fill; please no mas!",1086048000,4,353,3.9166666666666665
7274760,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"While many people stated this has been their favorite of the trilogy, I admit I loved them all equaly. Personaly, I think that they are all way beyond most movies that are released nowadays.
I'm sure you can find recaps / favorite scenes / best lines in other reviews, so I'll skip them. The 2 things that had bothered me in the movie are:
1) Some loose threads. While the fates of many of the characters (Sam, Frodo, Aragorn & Arwen, Gandalf, Galadriel, Celeborn & Lord Elrond)  were closed very nicely, some others were simply not given. Nothing was told of the future of the kingdom of Rohan - was it merged into a united men kingom with Rohan? If not - was Eomer the new king? What about the fates of Eowyn and Faramir? (even though I understand this might be added in the extended version of the movie). Also - the future of Merry, Pippin, & especially - of Legolas and Gimli - was missing. Has
Legolas gone to the Gray Havens? What had happened to his friendship with Gimli?
2) The only horrible part of this movie - the 'special features'. Not only do they cover the whole three movies (so they contain stuff that most people who watched the previous movies already know) - many of them were recycled. The first 2 features, for instance, contain a lot of the same interviews...
The acting was superb (as usual) - especially Sean Astin & Andy Serkis (who finally had a chance to act as himself!). Even the Arwen inserts weren't that bad this time.",1085961600,3,1453,4.441947565543071
7274761,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"For me, this is the best of the three movies.  It brings everything together and is the climax of the story.  The battles are absolutely breathtaking visually and do have touches of humor to break the relentless fury of the battles.  For example, after Legolas has done an amazing attack on one of the marauding giant elephants with the dozens of soldiers riding it with a 10.0 dismount, Gimli says, ""It still only counts as ONE!"" and off they go to more fighting.
When I read the book I was most touched by the scene where Frodo and Sam and just about finished on the slopes of Mount Doom and Sam says, ""I may not be able to carry the ring for you, Mr. Frodo, but I can carry you!""  He rousts his last reserves of strength and carries Frodo to their fate.  The movie was just as I had imagined it and I wish Sean Astin would have won every acting award for his portrayal of my favorite character in the trilogy.
The entire trilogy is a gift to all of us.  Yes, the books should be read and there is more there than in any movie could ever portray.  However, this is such a spectacular achievement that people will be enjoying it for generations.",1085961600,3,1146,4.277777777777778
7274762,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"", starring Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortenson, and others, is the final chapter of this trilogy.  Most trilogies begin falling in quality after the second or third edition.  This trilogy stays on top through every edition.  This edition won an amazing four Golden Globes and a record-tying eleven Oscars(clean sweap in both ceremonies), both including Best Picture and Best Director.  ""Ben-Hur"" (1959) and ""Titanic"" (1997) are the only other films to win eleven.  Like ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"", this honors the book version, written by JRR Tolkins, delightfully.  This also is one of the greatest action and fantasy films created in many years.  Such quality proves that the eight years spent on production and the two years spent on filming were spent wisely.  Since release, it's become the second highest grossing film worldwide with more than $1 billion in the Box Office, only exceeded by ""Titanic"".
""The Return of the King"" explores the further threat of the end of peaceful civilization.  Frodo's ring takes over him more, the wars become more grand, Aragon's fight for the throne grows more crutial, and the odds of survival become slimmer.  The spectacular chain of events keep audiences interested and amazed in every moment.  Director Peter Jackson leads the cast and crew to accomplish this masterpiece, which keeps audiences intact until the end.  The action scenes become more intense throughout the film.  Frodo's duty of destroying the ring grows more crutial, which grows more difficult because of Gollum's yearning for the ring.  However, the dramatic and the emotional theme never fades.  The characters' emotions are always expressed to the fullest as they should.  Therefore, this is more than an action/fantasy film.
The score, written by Howard Shore, blends perfectly with the events.  The fight scenes become more intense, and the dramatic vibes become more emotional.  While some songs are used for all three editions, the new ones are great editions to the trilogy.  Certain symphonies will become as well-known as the ""Star Wars"" or the ""ET: The Extra Terrestrial"" theme in the following years.  ""Into the West"" is a great ballad to end the movie, which is played in the end credits.  Annie Lennox sings it beautifully and emotionally.  It wonderfully commemorates and gives more closure to this film and trilogy.
The visionaries offer a more grand viewing experience.  The spectacular background is nothing like most other films.  The amazing hard work spent on the graphics and the millions spent on it paid off greatly.  Many filmmakes considered such perfection impossible before the film was released.  Regardless, it never distracts from the storyline's emotional aspect.  The costumes and the make-up wonderfully blend with the old-time theme.  The characters' physical features are realistic-looking.  The evil citizens become more scary-looking thanks to the artists.
The actors express the emotional aspects wonderfully.  Sean Astin performs at his career best in this film as Sam, who determinely supports Frodo through the journey.  Ian McKellen's Oscar-nominated role for ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" as Gandolf is to be highly noted, though slightly less demanding on this edition.  Elijah Wood expresses Frodo's struggles wonderfully.  As Frodo's well-being becomes increasingly in jeopardy, Wood accomplishes the process in every step.  All other actors add their own unique sense of being in the film.  Hobbits keep their cheerful and unique personalities, the fighters grow more determined, the evil grow more evil, and the stubborn become unforgettable thanks to the individual actors.
""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" is a great film to end this trilogy.  This is bound to be a classic in the following years as it will continue pleasing audiences.  Those interested in this film must watch the other two editions in order before watching this one.  Otherwise, the chain of events will be confusing.

There were very crucial parts left out and I'm not sure how the biggest one can be put back in for the extended version. I hate being a spoiler so I won't get more specific.

7274764,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"While the film speaks for itself, the thing I wanted to point out was the DVD.  The extra features are REALLY thin.  The meat of it being 2 documentaries that I had already seen on cable.
At this point, I would be inclined to just rent this edition and save my money for the extended edition that's coming out before Christmas.

7274765,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy will become a classic because director/writer, etc. Peter Jackson had a vision, stuck to it, and gave us three masterpieces of cinematic excellence.  Taking such a complex book as Tolkien's series was no easy task and in spite of many obstacles, Jackson delivered a trio of unbelievably well made adventures.
In this final chapter, Jackson's vision is beautifully realized with outstanding cinematography and editing; superb special effects and a wonderful cast of actors who were wrongfully ignored by Oscar for three years.
In this installment, Sean Astin becomes the ""soul"" of the movie, as he is willing to do anything to enable Frodo (the underrated Elijah Wood) dispose of the ring.  Andy Sartis' Gollum is another epic piece of animation, effects and vocal talent, not to mention the way in which Sartis' physical presence was utilized in the making of Gollum.  Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill are superb as the king and his daughter; David Wenham, Karl Urban, Billy Boyd (who comes to true maturation in this film), Dominic Monaghan, John Rhys-Davies, and of course the incomparable Ian McKellen finally gets the screen time he deserves and uses it well.
The battle scenes; the giant spider (probably the best ever captured on film); Howard Shore's magnificent score; the stunning visuals; the sets; the costumes.  This is what movie-making is all about.
Whether you're a true Tolkien fanatic or just an average viewer like myself, you cannot deny the power and splendor of this magnificent achievement in film-making.
Congratulations to Jackson and all for their 11 Oscars!",1085961600,7,1610,5.133587786259542
7274766,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I truly loved the movie - the music, the scenes, the feeling in the performances. It was a great ending to the trilogy. However, I bought the DVD hoping to see a preview of the special extended edition and got very disappointed when I found it didn't have one. Does anybody know whether there is really going to be one? In particular, if there is an extended edition, does anybody know whether PJ has written a scene where you can see even a sign that Faramir and owyn are going to fall in love as it happens in the book? I just feel that owyn and Faramir were such great characters that they deserved a little bit more happiness.",1085875200,2,630,4.302521008403361
7274767,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I don't think anyone can say enough about how great this movie was.  I think that the three LoR movies might even surpass the Star Wars Triology as the greatest Movie Triology ever.  My only complaint was the the Scouring of the Shire was not placed in the movies because it gives a little purpose to both Merry and Pippin at the end.  But outside of that the movie was wonderfully done.  The last few final scenes were powerful.  As for the technical stuff, the widescreen ofcourse is the way to go, the audio is great especially heard with surround sound.  The video quality sharp and crisp.  The disc is loaded with speical features.  I waited and got the Triology as one set and of course I have the extended versions as well, which I think are much better then these versions.  I would recommand getting this video but if you don't have all three then pay the extra money and get the triology set.",1085875200,,902,4.418181818181818
7274768,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"I have been a Tolkien and Lord of the Rings buff since I first read it over 30 years ago. My countless readings of it have naturally shaped my judgement of the movie, which was really done well.

Saddest was the fact that much of the detail was cut -- something which cannot be avoided considering the time factor -- but major things like Ghan-Buri-Ghan, the Houses of Healing, and (one of my favorites) the Scouring of the Shire are completely left out. That leaves the fate of Saruman and Wormtongue up in the air. (You'll find out if you see the extended version, but, sadly, it's completely different from the book.)

I also felt that the relationship between Frodo and Smeagol was exaggerated a bit too much while Frodo was meaner to Sam. (He doesn't tell him to go home in the book.) Also, the action and fighting was well and complete while the lighter, humorous portions were cut way down if not deleted altogether.

As a Lord of the Rings purist, I could go on and on, but I will end by saying that the movie is a great version of one of the greatest classic fantasies. However, if you really want to savor true Tolkien at his storytelling best, read the books. And for the best, roundest understanding of it all, take my advice: start with The Hobbit, then read The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.",1085875200,,1302,4.439330543933054
7274769,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Admittedly, I wasn't really into that whole ""Lord of the Rings"" hype at first. J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" was one of my favorite childhood books, and though I haven't read the ""LOTR"" trilogy, after watching Peter Jackson's (""Bad Taste"", ""The Frighteners"") first installment, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", I was mildly disappointed. I felt that the film, despite boasting some great performances, and spectacular special effects and cinematography, was a little too self-indulgent and grim.  In addition, I thought that the pace was lethargic - the film had too many `helicopter' shots of the main characters striding towards their destination. Since two more chapters were yet to come, I felt that the film should have had more than just numerous close-ups of weepy Elijah Wood's mug to compensate for the awareness that the goal would not be reached until the third part of the trilogy.  After all, this was supposed to be a grand fantasy for kids, and Peter Jackson failed to supplement the intermittent grandeur of impressive visual effects and mildly riveting suspense with the spine-tingling awe of, say, Wolfgang Petersen's ""NeverEnding Story"", or Bob Zemeckis' ""Back to the Future"" trilogy. ""Fellowship of the Ring"" was all impressive production value and epic scale, but no zest.
 ""The Two Towers"", the second installment, further disheartened me - I considered its structure messy, its pace even more languid than in the previous chapter. The constant identical close-ups of Elijah Woods expressing distress annoyed me doubly, as did Elrond, played by Hugo Weaving in 'Agent Smith' mode. The talking trees kept my attention for a while, but then their mumbling, interweaved with gorgeous shots of the protagonists walking through snowy mountains and endless plains, soothed me to sleep. I did wake up to watch Arwen (Liv Tyler, unnaturally gorgeous with elf-ears); I was enthralled by Gollum (the subsequent media dissection of the character, how it was made, and the actor Andy Serkis diminished some of Gollum's wondrous appeal); I enjoyed Ian McKellen's wizard Gandalf (who, I think, kept truest to Tolkien's magical spirit); and the final battle was startling in its scale. Still, I walked out of the theater somewhat confused: why wouldn't Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin) just fly one of those long-necked dragons all that way to the ring, instead of conquering monsters in caves and all that stuff? And what's all the rage about Orlando Bloom's Legolas, who comes off as a sissy with his elfish ears and long shampooed blonde hair?
 With the third chapter, ""The Return of the King"", Peter Jackson manages to validate his commitment and affection for the saga, if not the preposterous publicity his films have triggered (one could get a specially designed ""Lord of the Rings"" Harley Davidson bike - what association does a motorcycle have with J.R.R. Tolkien?!) After watching the final episode of the saga, I recognized and grew to appreciate the fact that essentially, the director kept true to his vision throughout, handled a hell of a yarn, and ended it with a blast. The virtuosity of Peter Jackson's grip becomes most apparent in ""The Return of the King"" - the film made me temporarily forget how much I criticized the first two installments.
 Frodo and Sam continue their quest, as the film opens with a little prehistory of Gollum, revealing his origins. Back in the present, the little bastard cunningly attempts to grasp hold of ""the precious"". In the meantime, the power of the ring is taking hold of Frodo, who struggles to resist its evil, abandoning loyal Sam in the process. This is soon followed by a giant spider scene, which I feared, having just suffered through two painfully tiring hours of watching hundreds of CGI ""Eight Legged Freaks"". However, I found myself on the edge of my seat at the sight of unconscious Frodo getting tangled up in sticky web, as Sam hurries to his rescue.  More than that, I remained on the edge of my seat almost until the end, as opposed to slouching back all the way through the first two chapters. The reason for that is: ""The Return of the King"" works as a separate film, with freshness introduced to the material. Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) asking the ghost army for help is a brilliant scene that leads to a stunning pay-off. Aragorn's romance with Arwen also feels fresh - it lacks the sentimentality of their previous encounters. Legolas proves he's not a sissy in a jaw-dropping confrontation with a giant elephant (the elf literally SURFES on top of the creature, killing off the enemy in the process, as well as slaughtering the mammoth, and it all looks real.) The battle goes on forever, and is executed flawlessly - it is almost impossible to tell where the CGI is, and when an army crashes through the combating legion, the thunderous power of it all will take your breath away.
 In ""The Return of the King"", Peter Jackson has taken the best elements of the two previous chapters - the action, the effects, the cinematography, Ian McKellen - and elaborated them into unreserved sumptuousness. The exhilaration and the palpable enthusiasm of the director overshadow small inconsistencies reminiscent of the preceding chapters, such as some stretched-out parts, a lengthy triple-ending which is just about groan-inducing, and, of course, the frustrating determination to win 'Best Puppy Eyes' contest on Elijah Woods' part - kid's acting range is clearly limited. Sam's the one we're rooting for from beginning to end, but annoyingly, Frodo gets all the credit. In actuality, director Peter Jackson and his team of filmmakers deserve all the credit, for making the last installment of the saga the most faithful to the spirit of J.R.R. Tolkien, or so I feel, even though my judgment is solely based on my memories of ""The Hobbit"". True aficionados of the writer might enjoy all three of the chapters, but in my opinion, only ""The Return of the King"" is the inspired cinematic masterpiece.",1085875200,2,5965,5.001007049345418
7274770,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Yes, I know I'm, breaking tradition and writing a review that is destined to be one of hundreds of 5 star reviews, which in all probability will not be widely read but write I must.
For those of you who have skipped the first two movies (I can't imagine who hasn't seen the first two) and figured you'd catch up on the finale, do yourself a favor and rent or buy (you may as well buy because you'll buy eventually), ""The Fellowship of the Rings"" and ""The Two Towers"", for you will surely be lost if you don't.
Lord of the Rings
The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a classic Good versus Evil saga. The Dark Lord Sauron, a maleficent creature, who was once thought to have been destroyed, resurrects himself in the temporary form of an evil eye and rebuilds a malevolent empire consisting of various kinds of evil creatures and ultimately plans to unleash them on his neighbors. Purpose? The annihilation of humanity. To this end, he is assisted by the mighty Wizard Saruman, who once was a force for good but because he believes Sauron cannot be stopped throws his lot in with his evil, once enemy.
This evil is countered by many heroes, some who give their lives fighting Sauron's hordes. The story revolves around a lost ring, one of several, but the most powerful, which was created by Sauron to conquer and enslave humanity in Middle Earth.
""One ring to rule them all, One ring to find them. One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them""
I must stop and explain here that humanity in Middle Earth consists of Man, the immortal Elves, Dwarves and Hobbits (diminutive manlike creatures with rather large feet). They are confronted by evil creatures which include Orcs, Trolls, Uruk-hai (vicious Orclike creatures made from mud), Ringwraiths (once human kings, now all powerful Sauron lieutenants) and various and assorted other creatures, the likes of which you have never seen.
The Return Of The King
There is so much to tell here I don't know where to begin. Gollum plots to lead Frodo and Sam into a trap with Shelob, a giant man eating spider. Sams hears parts of the plan as Gollum talks to his wicked other self and confronts Gollum who twists things around on Sam and makes Frodo believe he is the danger.
Gandalf finds out that Sauron plans to attack the Gandor, fortress city of Minas Tirinth and hurrys to warn the Royal Steward, who is insane and grief stricken and will not undertake the defense of the city. Finally Gandalf usurps his authority and starts to organize a defense.
In the meantime, with Pippens help and without the Stewards knowlege, Gandalf manages to light bonfire beacons and send word to Rohan of Gondor's plight and Rohan's King Theoden rounds up his army. Aragon is with Theoden and together they realize that Rohan's six thousand men at arms will be pitifully small against the combined might of Sauron's dark armies.
Enter Elond, known to some as agent Smith but thats another story, who hands Aragon the rebuilt sword that destroyed Sauron two thousand years ago and implores him to take his rightful title as King Of Gondor. Yes, Aragon, our hero, is a descendant of the Kings of Gondor.
If things are getting complicated, stand by. Elond strongly suggests that the only hope to defeat Sauron's army is to go into a haunted mountain, into the Paths of the Dead and get the spectres to honor a pledge they broke in antiquity.
Gollum springs his trap on Frodo and he's cocooned by Shelob but Sam, who had been sent away saves Frodo but before he could free Frodo, Sam has to hide from approaching Orcs.
Will Aragon recruit his mystery army? Will Sam free Frodo? Will their Quest succeed? I invite you to see the movie.
Conclusion
The actors were great. After three movies you really get to appreciate these guys and gals. Despite the morose subject matter, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan tended to lighten things up with comedic antics and tongue in cheek humor. Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen had the parts of a lifetime and they ran with it. And for me, a great part of the movie was Sean Astin's portrayal of Sam. I am disappointed that at least one of them was not up for an Oscar but you know the Acadamy.
Do I recommend this movie? If I've yet to make that clear, let me say this. I know this movie is not for everybody and you know who you are. For the others this and the two predecessors, each individually and collectively are the real greatest movie and story ever told.",1085788800,,4461,4.584480600750939

This movie is wonderful and entertaining. The visual aspects of the movie are incredible, the battle scenes are beautifully choreographed. Jackson hit the mark with this movie, although certain aspects of the movie are undermined - ghosts from the Paths of the Dead, Green?! - running time - a massive 3 and 1/2 hours.

Tolkien. A story of the fight to bring down Sauron and again have a time of peace without war or anything else.

7274776,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"When one talks of the all time great movies, the Godfather Trilogy (well actually the first two), Schindlers List, Saving Private Ryan comes to mind.  Now, add to that list the Lord of the Rings Movies by Peter Jackson.  In fact it would be rude, nay, disrespectful to Prof Tolkien,if the entire three movie were not taken as one long 11 hour epic and judged based on that alone.
Return of the King (ROTK)continues the story immediately where the last movie left off about two little Hobbits' quest to destroy the evil One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor.  In the meantime, the humans are preparing for round two of the obsession by the evil Sauron to wipe them off the face of (Middle) Earth.  if the battle at Helms Deep at the end of movie two set the future standard for battle sequences in film, the battle at Palennor Fields completely blows it away and redefines the mark.  To many fans, this theatrical release is but an extended trailer for the inevitable [back aching] that is the Extended Edition that is slated at Christmas time.  But this release is no slouch either clocking in at an incredible 200 minutes long.
Video Quality:
I have to admit at being worried that some compromises in quality had to be sacrificed to fit the entire movie on only one disc.  However, the transfer was absolutely pristine and simply puts some of the other movie transfers at half the length to shame.  Incredible.  All said, there was some blurring in the fast moving battle-scenes but you'd have to be a pick-wit to notice.  Reference quality.
Sound Quality:
Like the previous two releases, the movie comes with Dolby Digital-EX surround and it absolutely rocks, my movie room was a earthquake zone when the movie was over.  Lots of low frequency rumble will have your neighbours keeping 911 busy.  All in an excellent sound field and sound transfer.  It remains to be seen if the DTS version in the extended edition can top this excellent offering.
The Extras:
I have to admit that I was a little disappointed at the offering in disc two where the extras are housed.  The extras contained two documentaries which only newbies will really get excited about and a national Geographic special comparing LOTR characters and situations to real life events and characters like William Wallace and Benjamin Franklin etc.  Missable.  There are a few web featurettes and an introduction to the coming video strategy game by EA.  Perhaps the BIGGEST disappointement is the absence of the music video of the Oscar winning song ""Into The West"" by annie Lennox.  How hard can it be to put in a simple music video to complete the offering.  If I were rating the extras I would definitely give it a 2 out of 10.  Having the music video could have redeemed the lacklustre offering.  But considering that I am getting my hands on the DVD two months early, its a small price to pay, although I feel that they should have put in the music video.

7274777,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The end of this film-- after all the fighting, the sacrifices of choice and hope and life itself-- is unspeakably sad, for two of literature's (and cinema's) greatest friends, Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee, are separated: the scene is meant to be a joyous one but it is hard not to share Sam's feelings, or his tears. It is, after all, not just the end of a magnificent friendship, but the end, finally, of the greatest motion-picture trilogy of all time.
Although it is ""the end of all things,"" as Frodo calls the grim conclusion of his Ring-quest, Return of the King begins, oddly, and endearingly, with the beginning-- the violent seizure of the Ring of Power by Smeagol (Andy Serkis, who has also provided the voice of Gollum for the trilogy), a Stoor who is forced to flee into the Misty Mountains with the Ring-- and the blood of his cousin, Deagol, on his hands. He devolves before our eyes, with his ""precious,"" the Ring, his only remaining possession. It is a stark sequence that nicely sets the desolate tone for the film-- indeed, all the characters must wrestle with their idea of what is ""precious,"" and the journeys they will undertake to have it.
Fathers grieve lost sons; lovers grieve the miles between them; kings mourn nations lost, and on the brink of destruction. This theme-- the loss of ""precious,"" whoever or whatever it may be-- underlines the entire saga, and gives a certain poignancy to the struggles of the Smeagol personality trapped in the murderous form of the creature called Gollum, whose treachery in pursuit of the Ring reaches chilling proportions in the closing minutes of the film. Truly this is Gollum's film; for all the awards the film rightly received, one was overlooked: Best Supporting Actor for Andy Serkis, who did more with his voice and 3-5 minutes of screen time, than many actors manage to accomplish in dozens of films, or entire careers.
The doomed King of Rohan, Theoden (Bernard Hill, and excellent throughout), offers a rousing speech about the ending of an era and the imminence of death, and death stalks heavily through the film: it has been called the darkest chapter of the trilogy, and fairly so. The characters killed, maimed, or psychologically ruined by the events of the last hour of the film, are so many, that it is easier to count those not affected, on some level, by all that has gone before. This film more than makes up for the rather light, almost frivolous tone of Fellowship of the Ring.
There are omissions, of course: Where is Saruman (Christopher Lee)? He is mentioned, briefly, but never seen. And where are Gimli and Legolas when the elves take their leave at the end of the story? And what of the role of Grima (Brad Dourif), who has a major part is resolving the ""Scouring of the Shire""-- scenes never shown, or even alluded to, in the theatrical version of the film. I suspect at least some of these questions will be addressed with the extended-version DVD release later on this year. I hope so.
The theatrical-release DVD contains a few making-of specials, a well-done mega-trailer covering the entire trilogy, but, sadly, none of the looked-for previews of the next film in the series: this is it....until, at least, Jackson announces the filming of The Hobbit.
In the Academy Award-winning closing theme (sung beautifully by Annie Lennox), we are asked, ""Why do you weep?"" Because the long and wonderful journey has come to an end. But as it the bards of old wrote, in that plaintive old song sung by Bilbo Baggins for many years, ""The Road goes ever on and on""-- and what a journey it has been.",1085702400,,3583,4.716108452950558

7274779,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"With Peter Jackson's final installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, he has more than crushed the concerns that the ""Return of the King"" would be subject to the same trilogy/sequel woes as ""The Matrix"" or ""Star Wars."" Jackson truly saved his best work for last, and even long-time readers of Tolkien's series (which I am) will have very little to complain about. In ""Return of the King"" he gave us the most spectacular battle scene ever filmed, industry-changing special effects, a true adaptation that rarely deviated from the source (and when it did deviate it generally helped the story), and fine direction, getting brilliant performances out of every cast member fortunate enough to be involved with this masterpiece.
The standout in this movie is Sean Astin as Sam Gamgee. Jackson has an intimate understanding of Tolkien's story, and expertly let's it blossom over three movies until we gradually realize, as we did in the books, that this is Sam's story and Sam's quest more than it is Frodo's. ""I may not be able to carry it for you, Mr. Frodo. But I can carry you,"" a teary-eyed Sam pronounces near the film's end. This is one of the better moments in the history of movie-making. Astin's performance is flawless throughout this three and a half hour epic, but somehow seems to get even better as it goes on.
I felt ""Return of the King"" was far superior to ""The Two Towers"" in many respects. ""The Two Towers"" often felt disjointed and never really found its groove. Just as you were getting into the battle scenes, you were suddenly with Treebeard in dead silence, moving at a snail's pace through the forest. Jackson was able to interweave the many storylines of ROTK seamlessly, masterfully leading us to the next logical place, making the audience feel as though that's where the story *should* go, not question why it *did* go there.
ROTK will probably not please everyone. Fans of Orlando Bloom will be disappointed that he is not featured, getting very little screen time. Those who criticized Jackson for using Gimli only as comic relief in ""The Two Towers"" won't find any comfort in ROTK. He probably has only one or two lines that aren't meant to inspire laughter. However, for what it's worth, I found him very funny and overall there is a much greater humor presence in ROTK than any of the other movies. Then there's the beginning, which I will agree is very slow. Unlike the testosterone-injected opening of ""The Two Towers,"" ROTK starts with a character exposition of Smeagol. I think the opening would've benefited from some more intense action.
Devotees to Tolkien will surely have their pick of plots that Jackson altered, added or omitted, but I don't think they'll have much of a leg to stand on. The major changes from the books were first, the timing of the stories. The ending of ""The Two Towers"" novel actually occurs in the middle of ROTK, but this is just a function of how he chose to tell it- it doesn't necessarily alter the story, just what events appear under what title. Second, he added a conflict between Sam and Frodo, where Gollum is corrupting Frodo to turn against Sam. This however, adds a great deal of dramatic tension to the plot and doesn't change any of the character intent of Tolkien. It only magnified tensions that were already there between the two Hobbits. Then there was the scene with Shelob (the spider), which was slightly altered. In the novel Sam (and the reader) didn't find out until much later that Frodo wasn't dead but only paralyzed. Again, this didn't bother me and I'm willing to give Jackson these liberties as long as it helps his story along, not to mention the spider scene was so bone-chilling that I barely noticed any changes. Lastly though - and here I might find some merit of the critics - is the issue of Aragorn and the Palantir (the glass ball with the eye of Sauron). In the novel, Aragorn makes the decision to look into the ball deliberately in order to deceive Sauron and draw his attention from Frodo. This was very important to his character and led to him coming to terms with who he was as the King of Gondor. This was omitted almost entirely from the movie, with only a casual reference made by Gandalf. It certainly wasn't something that hurt the movie for me, and though I don't fully understand why Jackson chose this, he's more than earned the benefit of the doubt.
The DVD is predictably impoverished, and I'd expect there to be at least two more packages where this is availeble. One will be the extended special features edition, and the next will be the Trilogy. If you can hold off from buying, it may be worth it, but remember that they usually structure the special features so that you'll get bonuses in this version that you won't get in others.
ROTK has laugh out loud comedy, some of the most courageous acts we've seen on film, and action and effects beyond my ability to describe. What more could we possibly ask for?

7274781,1,B00Z9YZRVE,"Having seen the first two movies on DVD, I have to say that watching the third film in the series, the Return of the King, was probably the most baffling and dissapointing experience in all my years of watching film.
First off, whatever contract negotiations that were involved in making the third film animated were just completely wrong headed.  The animated characters look nothing like thier real life counterparts, and Aragorn gets far less screen time then the title would suggest.  Even so, it would have been nice to have the original stars (Ellijah Wood, Ian Mckellen, et al) at least lend thier voices to the characters.  One can only surmise that the Producers of these films thought that audiences would be so wrapped up in the story that they wouldn't care if the final installment was mailed to people on cocktail napkins.
And there is also so much that has not paid off in this third installment, not the least of which is:  Where is Arwen?
I put the third movie next to the others in my collection, but somehow it doesn't seem to fit.  Maybe I have to watch it a few times more.",1085702400,6,1094,4.561224489795919
7274782,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is very similar to Star Wars, thirty years later. Both boast great action scenes and amazing special effects. Viggo Mortenson is like Harrison Ford: both small-time actors who became big during and after their huge movies.
This is a great movie and at three and a half hours long is never boring. The characters are so developed and likeable (and the bad ones so hateable) you will find yourself cheering the entire way through. For people young and old, this a the perfect family movie or a great date movie. Peter Jackson does a wonderful job at taking the story from the book, but shortening it so it is not fourty hours long. Like what was mentioned above, this movie has great special effects. I will not spoil the movie so I will end in saying BUY THIS MOVIE!",1085702400,,795,4.489655172413793
7274783,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Since Jaws, some of the best movies ever made have combined spectacular special effects with heartfelt, personal moments. The closer these two elements come together, the better the film is. In Return of the King, you can see actors and special effects blend perfectly. Take, for example, Eowyn fighting the Witch-King of Angmar. She looks terrified but defiant, shaken one moment and able to deliver a killing blow in the next. But it's all faked --- she was attacking open air when her parts were filmed. The slithery Fell Beast and Witch-King were added digitally. We all know it's faked, but the moment is absolutely convincing.
The rest of the movie has the same feel. Are the landscapes real,  or digital? It doesn't matter. The actors draw you in and make it all seem real --- and the special effects artists have given every weapon, battlement, and creature a historical authenticity.
The best parts of the movie are saved for the end. The One Ring has to be destroyed in a way that is epic but intimate. Frodo's struggle leads to a surprise twist, and Gollum becomes far more important to the fate of Middle Earth than anyone imagined. The epilogue scenes are beautifully-filmed, drawing the whole saga to a close perfectly. If you missed this movie at the theater, you should check out the DVD. It's worth watching over and over to catch every detail..",1085702400,,1362,4.771186440677966
7274784,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Simply put the greatest movie ever made, for the greatest story every told - and that means better than the usual classics such as the Homer (not Homer Simpson for the illiterate), Tolstoy, Shakespeare, Dickens, Goethe and other long dead authors. Better than the Matrix, better than Star Wars, better than Titanic or Spiderman, The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Metropolis or Finding Nemo or Gone with the Wind or any other movie I have ever seen, which includes virtually all of the AFI top 100 films list.
Movie making history has been made with this epic production.
Yes there will be those who did not like this movie, usually those who have not bothered to use their brains and actually read it and are to quote ""regular cinemophiles"". Tolkien himself accepted that many would find his novel boorish and to all those who quible and complain or did not like, you are entitled to your opinion and as the professor said,  I (and he) will probably detest the things you find enjoyable. Each to his own!
For those who have read the novels, and the true Tolkien afficionados, the changes may be irritating but certainly reasonable bearing in mind this is a completely different medium to a novel. I believe most fans (which spans the gamut from teenagers, to doctors and scientists, churchmen and regular people, educated people, stupid and smart in varying degrees, religious or agnostic), will agree that the spirit of Tolkien lives on.
Special effects are part of the story, not the story, the battles do not detract from the individual storyline. Courage and fortitude shine through, characaters show their frailty, they are scared, and desperate but they find it within themselves to go on. Despite knowing the novel intimately, I was captivated and felt every moment as if it was the first time.
The themes are all there, beautifully portrayed by a cast that cared about their work as art and not just a quick job to the pay the bill. If you don't find yourself moved, it shows you are one of those that Tolkien referred to above.
Those who criticise the endings, show the lack of appreciation of Tolkien's depth. To gain a victory some people pay a price and can never regain their former lives. Simple victories are what the massess want, more poignant moments are far from the usual Hollywood fare or mass market paperback.  Frodo paid for the victory, he can never be wholly healed of the scars. Sam's family is what they all fought for, the little people who as Frodo said ""all the stupid little hobbits.. but I love the Shire.. "" (a quote from the novel). They did not embark on this quest for personal power or fame, but for a higher ideal.
The endings are perfect, as moving and bitter sweet as the novel.
Soundtrack is stirring, complementing the movie superbly.
Many spine tingling scenes abound: the last ride of Rohirrim, the pass of Cirith Ungol, Shelob's lair, Farimirs pain and courage, Frodo and Sam's struggles, the ring that eventually overcomes Frodo, Gollum's glee at getting his precious, sweeping shots of Minas Tirith and the battle of the Pelennor fields.
Peter Jakson, the whole NZ crew and New Line cinema deserve a standing ovation for their vision in bringing the most popular story of at least the 20th Century if not all time, to the screen and in going the extra distance to make it nearly perfect.
The othe Oscar Nominations for best movie are no where near as good, a well deserved victory for deep and moving stories.
Hints of the special edition abound, scenes to come probably include Merry's pledge to King Theoden, Eomers anguish at his sister's apparent demise, the  Mouth of Sauron and probably a lot more.

Favorite scene; the spine tingling prelude to King Theoden's last ride. "" Death!"" they scream and then they thundered forward to ""meet the doom of our time""",1085616000,9,3805,4.760606060606061
7274785,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Peter Jackson's awe inspiring adaptation of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to a close with the Return of the King.  Picking up where Two Towers left off, ROTK up's the ante for everything set in the previous two films; ranging from the ultra epic battle scenes (the battle of Helm's Deep from Two Towers is nothing compared to the warfare here), superb makeup and special effects, and amazing acting from everyone involved.  Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are close to concluding their quest to destroy the ring in the fiery depths of Mount Doom, while they are led by the deceitful Gollum (Andy Serkis) who has plans of his own.  Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson) accepts his role in the kingdom of men while he, Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Gandalf (Ian McKellan) endure the never ending onsalught of dark lord Sauron's forces.  Undoubtadly the best film in the Lord of the Rings film series, director/producer/co-screenwriter Peter Jackson and his crew have crafted something truly special here.  ROTK deservedly won every Oscar it was nominated for (including Best Picture and Best Director), and the surprising and amazing emotional depth from the actors (Astin and McKellan especially) has to be seen to be believed.  Roles of returning cast members, including Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Bernard Hill, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Hugo Weaving, Miranda Otto, David Wenham, and Karl Urban, are more limited here, but their performances, along with the screenwriting of Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens, are to be comended.  All in all, ROTK solidifies the prediction made before the first film was released: this will be and is a film series that will be cherished for generations to come.",1085616000,5,1741,5.109154929577465
7274786,1,B00Z9YZRVE,"First, I'll start by saying that this review is not for fans of the original books by Tolkien. They will approach these movies in a different way than the rest of us, regular cinephiles or moviegoers, who didn't read those. I mean, for them is a whole other experience, since they are already familiar with the plot and characters and situations, so they will like the movies or not on their own.
I will address, as I said before, the rest of us. I had seen the two previous installments and liked them both in some ways. I even tried to watch The Two Towers one second time and found it a bit tiresome. But, that was me.
And then... this one. When I got to the theatre and the movie started to go, I found myself less and less interested in the characters and situations, and by half the movie, the trilogy's visual atmosphere had already worn out. For starters, this movie is almost the same as the previous one: one Frodo complaining all the way about the ring, one loyal Sam, one treacherous Gollum. But also, one good vs evil epical battle that seems impossible to win firsthand, one heroe against incredible odds, and one beautiful Liv Tyler that you don't really quite get why is she in the movie for.
You seen it before, all of this, now, this 3 hour elephant will give you all of this, all over again with one inmensely boring epilogue, which got even fans of the films to say that it should have ended quite earlier.
Scale does not always work for the best. This is not a great epic film, and frankly, after this one I finally turned the whole trilogy down. I am almost sure, that, like those Matrix movies (which are far worse than these, I'll reckon) LOTR won't pass the test of time like the Star Wars originals did, or other great epic films.
Once again, for the Tolkien fan, this does not apply, I can basically understand their rejoice in movies they have been imagining for years, and I respect that. But for the casual viewer, beware, there is nothing you haven't seen before (except for that horrible ending, that is).",1085616000,15,2037,4.434666666666667
7274787,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I am glad to see I am not the only person who finds the closing of the series of LOTR makes me extremely sad. I remember how excited I was four years ago when browsing on the web I found out that the LOTR was being made. I was fearful of what would be done to this classic book, as all the movies to this point were atrocious. But after I saw the first film in this series I relaxed, and went with the flow.
I beg to differ with some who felt the length and the multiple endings of this film were too much. Read your Tolkien. He also had multiple endings. When you have so many important characters, Tolkien knew there had to be an explanation for what happened to them after the quest had been fulfilled. He could not drop it at the place where the Ring and Gollum fell into the fire. Jackson may have made a mistake on editing as per having the screen go completely dark, but otherwise I felt this part of the series to be as strong as the first film, and complete.
Lovers of Tolkien will complain that Jackson changed the story slightly. I think Tolkien would have approved of most of the changes. A king has to have a queen, and in many ways, the books were lacking in female presence. Jackson and his co-workers made up for that lack of presence, and I found it in keeping with Tolkien's mythology. Our world has changed. Though women did not participate in WWI (during Tolkien's time in battle), they were present during WWII, during Vietnam, and they are participators in current wars, for good or for evil. Strong women as presented in Jackson masterpiece are a part of our world, and fight alongside our men to preserve our freedoms and our homes, their homes. That needs to be recognized.
I am waiting for the extended version of this movie to come out and then will buy all three extended versions together and give our current DVDs to my kids. The series, the three movies deserved recognition at the Oscars for doing something that had never been done before...making a classic tale, a long one, into a masterpiece by shooting three movies at the same time. My kudos to all the great actors and actresses involved, and to Jackson for not destroying my favorite book!

the only complains would be the ending or should i say endings.  but i can live with it (but i really desire that at least they should have taken off the ending with Sam and his children.... not only did that like...ruin it for me but Sam was not even the main character...it should not have ended with him... I have nothing against Sam he is one of my favorite characters...but to have him in the end...) for the extended edition (which i can imagine will be very long) they should TAke away that ending instead of extending
now on to the dvd extras
There is a Trailer in the dvd for all 3 movies...it like shows all  3 movies in 6 minutes...it is great...
but other than that... the extras were not too good and they did not have a preview of the extended edition of ROTK
Recommend it to add to the collection

7274789,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"It is interesting to me how a review could contain the ideas that this movie doesn't contain good special effects, and that there is ""hope that no one buys this movie"". First, the special effects in the movie are astounding, yet not overwhelming. Realism is key here, and the movie accomplishes this without question. Second, the ""hope"" that no one purchases this movie just speaks of bias. Anyone worth their salt would give opinion and allow others to form their own by viewing this movie. Unlike perhaps the Matrix series, in which the latter two movies are mere shadows of the first, this concludes the series with consistency and, again, accuracy to the tale.
That being said, I agree with other viewers that this is a fitting and incredible end to our journey through an intense and accurate depiction of the books through film. I await the extended version eagerly.",1085616000,2,872,4.82
7274790,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"This film did not deserve the ""Best Picture"" oscar and was by far the weakest of the three films.  The ending was horrible and all I can say is get a better editor.  The ghost scenes from Pirates of the Caribbean were far superior to the ones in this film.  By the end of the film you wish Frodo could have fallen to his death along with Gollum.  He tried to do too much in this film and the true trophy of this entire series was by far The Two Towers.",1085616000,6,452,3.934065934065934
7274791,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I remember watching some of Peter Jacksons previous movies, Bad Taste, Dead Alive, and Meet the Feebles.  When I heard that he was helming this very ambitious project I was a bit suprised and worried.  But when I saw the final project of Fellowship of the Ring I was pleasantly suprised.  I was a big fan of the books and despite the minor changes, he hit it right on.
This was an excellent retelling of the Return of the King, one of the slower moving of the three books.  There were changes and omissions, some of which I hear are going to be on the special edition of the dvd, this is the desperate to have it version.
High Points
Smeagol/Gollums history, an interesting way to start the movie.
Shilob, the spider woman, not what I envisioned, but it was a creepy ass scene none the less.
The depiction of Minas Tirith, I liked the Greek Roman style they used.  I may be wrong on that since the history of architecture isn't one of my specialties.
The battle of Minas Tirith, I know it is CGI, but that is the biggest cavalry charge I have ever seen in a movie.  It was also nice to finally see what the olyphants were going to do in battle.
The breakdown of Sam, Frodo, and Gollumn.
The madness in the Regent of Minas Tirith.
There isn't much else that I can say that will sway opinions one way or another.  Just see this movie, the only acceptable reason to wait would be for the special edition.",1085616000,,1401,4.304182509505703

7274793,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"What can I say? Whether you're a die hard LOTR fan, or just like the series, it's a must have. While some people are holding out for the Extended Edition, I like to have the theatrical release as well.
The cinematography is excellent, with vast, sweeping panoramas; the battle scenes are truly epic (and even somewhat humerous at times); and the music matches perfectly. But, I think the 11 Academy Awards speak for themselves...
And since there doesn't seem to be any difference between getting the three movies individually instead of the boxed set, why not pick one up today?",1085529600,,578,4.79
7274794,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I just bought the movie yesterday. And, I must say that it has stayed in my five-player DVD on constant repeat. I just can't get enough!
First of all, let me say that the storyline and premise of this epic adventure is wonderful. It far surpasses many other movies of it's type. It definitely deserves the 11 academy awards it recieved, and the adulation from the fans world-wide.
The story picks off were The Two Towers left off. Frodo and Sam are still struggling to make it to Mordor. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolos are trying to do all they can to stem the tide of Sauron. Man (Aragorn), Elf (Legolas), and Dwarf (Gimli), and their united fellowship is all that has stemmed the tide thus far. But, in this movie every element of thier friendship is tested. The absolute coming of war, the strain of sustaining strength against the coming wave, and the test of love. Yet, the three friends remain true to one another and their fellowship. Especially, the friendship between the Dwarf and the Elf are wonderful for all of 'movie-going man' to see.
Ultimately, the story ends with this latest saga and although many claim the end of the movie to be too long and overdrawn. You would be intrisically lost did you not truly discover the destiny of all our heroes. I personally think that Tolkien would turn over in his grave were it not represented.
If you don't own the epics...""The Fellowship of the Ring"", ""The Two Towers"", and ""The Return of the King""...I suggestion you purchase them immediately. For kids, adults, and elderly folk they are three movies worth seeing. And, for me, ""The Return of the King"" represents the best of the installment.
Happy watching! And, let's get the Extended Edition out on DVD ASAP!!!!!!!!!!",1085529600,,1724,4.711920529801325
7274795,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This movie was glorious in so many ways.  The soundtrack was absolutely delightful and the beauty of new Zealand added greatly to the tone of the movie.  Another movie that follows the text with 100% accuracy is the AE version of Pride and Prejudice.  THe movie is six hours long but worth every minute.  To get to the point, long movies may seem like a waste of time, but trust me, this one is worth it.",1085529600,,404,4.276315789473684

7274797,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"MOVIE: The closing chapter to Peter Jackson's epic fantasy tale based on the famous book finally hits DVD. This best picture winner is the definition of epic. What really makes the film so enjoyable is not the intense battles or the amazing special effects, but the characters. We have watched these characters grow from the first film all the way to this. If the characters didn't work then the film would have been a failure. What Lord Of The Rings has going for it is that, yes it's a fictional tale between good and evil, but it relates to real world events both historic and modern. One other observation that I had is how similar this film resembles a game of chess. You've got the Orcs as the pawns, the Trolls and towers as the rooks, the Oliphants as the knights, the queen can bee seen as the witch king, and the king as Sauran. Then we have similar resemblances on the good side. Even in one scene Gandalf says,""the board is set, the pieces are moving"". The movie is the greatest fantasy epic ever made and an excellent closure to the trilogy. This will become a classic and is a masterpiece. I find it amazing how Peter Jackson came from doing bad horror films into something like this.
VIDEO: Absolutely perfect, a flawless 2.35:1 widescreen presentation.
AUDIO: A Dolby EX 5.1 mix that is just as amazing as the other films. The technical quality is consistent on all three theatrical editions of the film.
PACKAGING / EXTRAS: This comes in a blue colored Armaray case. The first movie's color theme was green, the second was red, and the third blue. The extras are almost identical to the other two theatrical sets. You have some specials from different tv stations, the typical ""making of"", in depth featurettes, trailers, the near 7 minute long trailer for the entire series as a whole, a look at the EA games of the series, and your lordoftherings.net featurettes. As you know, the real meat is going to be in the extended edition this fall. A must have set that keeps the consistency of the series on DVD.
Movie Score: (5 Stars / 5 Stars)
DVD Score: (9 / 10)",1085529600,,2077,4.541333333333333
7274798,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"It feels almost redundant to review ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King."" How much promotion does this DVD need? The movie earned $1.1 billion worldwide in its initial release, the second highest-grossing film in history. It nabbed eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Critics raved about it. Audiences staggered out of the film in stunned amazement. Certainly, there are people didn't like it. Some viewers simply aren't interested in fantasy, and a small minority of J.R.R. Tolkien fans objected to the changes made to the original novel (I belong to the majority that believes the movies, despite alterations, remain extremely faithful to the source book). However, no film in my recent memory has garnered such strong love and adulation as ""The Return of the King."" It has become the great epic film event of its time, the same way that ""Star Wars"" was over thirty years ago. All effects films will now be measured against it. If you've seen it, chances are you loved or at least liked it and will want this DVD. If you haven't seen it, no time like the present...you'll have to see it eventually!
For the buyer, however, a note of caution: an expanded special edition DVD set will hit shelves later this year. As with the releases of the previous installments in the trilogy, this second set will contain a longer version of the film (four hours in length) with two discs loaded with extras that total in excess of seven hours, plus four feature-length commentaries!
By comparison, the DVD offered here is far slimmer: only two discs long, with `basic' extras and the theatrical version of the film (a bit over three hours). The documentaries are promotional pieces from TV, and don't have a lot of info in them because they were released before the film and kept many parts of it secret. (The National Geographic Special has already been available separately on DVD). The short featurettes are adequate and only whet your appetite for the expanded DVD release; there's not much hard data here. The inevitable ad for the videogame hardly counts as an `extra'. The six-minute ""Super Trailer"" for all three films is a pretty nice feature, however.
For a casual viewer, this DVD should satisfy them. People who really loved the film might want to wait a few months and get the expanded edition instead. Tolkien lunatics like myself should get both. (I want to be able to watch the two different cuts separately, and if I don't have time to sit with friends and watch the four-hour version, we can watch the slimmer theatrical cut.) Whether you buy this DVD or the later one depends on how important ""The Return of the King"" is to you personally.
The final third of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy of movies exceeded all expectations. Jackson took the most epic portion of the novel, with the final showdown between Sauron's forces of Mordor and the Men of Gondor, and Frodo and Sam closing in on the completion of their quest, and fashioned a film both magnificent in scope -- surpassing not only the previous two films but every film ever made -- and with deep emotions and wonderful characters. It's an astonishing feat that the biggest of the three films is the most touching and ""human."" Frodo's struggle against the Ring as he closes in on Mt. Doom unbearable torment, and his companion Sam (Sean Astin, in a role that should have received a Supporting Actor nomination) shows the greatest bravery and dedication of any character in the story. Every character gets his or her chance to shine, whether in a dramatic scene or a battle sequence.
And the battles...nothing like them has ever been shown before. The initial strike on Minas Tirith, with catapult rocks decimating entire columns of orcs and flying Nazgul making vertigo-inducing dives onto the city, steals away one's breath. The climatic clash before Minas Tirith, with the Rohirrim battling a brigade of mumakil (titanic elephants), is the most sweeping battle scene ever put on screen. The technical effects are the best in cinema history, and they are all put in service of the story instead of existing to wow audiences, as happens in most popcorn summer flicks. The meld of drama, character, and technical achievement in ""The Return of the King"" is seamless; I doubt we will see the like of it again -- at least during the next decade.
The most common complaint about the film is that it has ""too many endings."" I don't understand this criticism at all. After three full movies with these characters, it would be a cheat to abandon them without giving each one a special farewell. It would also let down the epic story, for this is a great tale that requires a large deal of wrapping up for it to work. For Tolkien fans, indeed, the ending feels too quick! (A major portion of the end of the novel, ""The Scouring of the Shire"" was not filmed because it would have dragged the ending on too long.) It's rare for a film today to let its characters stretch and resolve their stories correctly, and I commend Jackson for not cutting ""The Lord of the Rings"" short at the end in a hurry to `get it over with.' Savor this film to the end...it's a remarkable achievement.
It's with some sadness that I face this DVD release, for it means that ""The Lord of the Rings"" movie trilogy is over, and there will be no highly anticipated, thrilling release coming this December. But I have the movie in my hands now, mine forever to cherish and re-watch whenever I want to relive the stunning experience. No DVD owner should be without this cornerstone of epic cinema -- in one edition or another.",1085529600,6,5575,4.713114754098361
7274799,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"While we all wait for the Extended Version to be released in the late fall/early winter, this dvd is what we manage for the time being.
I don't think I need to get into too much details about the movie since it's touched the hearts of millions of viewers and won numerous, well-deserved awards including best picture.
However, unlike the previous dvd releases, this one is lacking in content.  The featurettes are very short and don't really give any insight on anything we don't already know.  The two in-depth documentaries aren't any different from one another.  They both cover the same topics and show the same interviews.  The National Geographic documentary is interesting though isn't anything worth remembering a few years down the road.
There are no music videos (probably didn't bother making one) or previews on the extended edition coming soon (disappointment).  And of course, you get the EA Games ads and trailers.
Still, like I said before, this DVD will do for now until the Extended Edition is released!  Unless you're a real die-hard fan, can't wait for the extended edition of the movies, and want every single release, go ahead and buy this.",1085529600,3,1162,4.903061224489796
7274800,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"I won't review the film itself, since bazillions have already done so and if you're reading this you've probably seen the film and are considering whether to buy *this* DVD. :-)
First, let me say that I own both the theatrical and extended DVD versions of Fellowship and Two Towers, and I fully intend to get the extended Return of the King when it comes out. There is no question in my mind about the tremendous cinematic achievement these films represent.
If you are the type who loves both the theatrical versions and extended versions of the films, then get this DVD.
If you're the type who has to own absolutely every little bit of LOTR film memorabilia, then get this DVD.
If you are the type who really gets off on lots of cool DVD extras, then this release may disappoint you.
Of the three full-length TV documentaries included, the first two are essentially the same, with the same interviews, the same stock footage, even the same narrator. They were produced by the same company, Arden, to air on different TV channels, but they are essentially the same show.
Then there's the National Geographic ""Beyond the Movie"" documentary... Oy. Don't get me wrong; I've been a NG reader since small kid days. Maybe that's why I found this program so disappointing. An earlier NG special about LOTR examined the mythological and literary roots of Tolkien's world, a subject so rich in linguistic, historical, and literary material that it easily deserved more than the survey-class approach Nat'l Geo gave it. This later NG documentary, on the other hand, really stretches to draw parallels between Tolkien's archetypes and historical figures such as Benjamin Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt. It just smacks of someone's cheesy marketing idea to cash in on the LOTR craze and yet still deliver something of educational value. It's nowhere near Nat'l Geo's usual standard.
The rest of the DVD extras are trailers and featurettes from the film's official website. Interesting and cool, but not new. And do we really need to see another ad for Electronic Arts, I ask you?
In summary, the movie itself is worth 5 stars, but I'm giving the DVD just 4 because the extras are ho-hum. On to the Extended Edition! :-)",1085529600,,2208,4.828496042216359
7274801,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The film, of course, is magnificent. Featuring the denouement of all that has come before, with great actors to play the parts, gorgeous visuals to enchant us, fantastic special effects, and a glorious score throughout the film, ""Return of the King"" represents over 3 hours of cinematic genius. It is a nearly-perfect conclusion to the story that was begun in ""Fellowship of the Ring"" and continued in ""The Two Towers."" This should not be a surprise to anyone.
The DVD presentation of ""Return of the King"" is of consistently high-quality with the previous two Theatrical version DVD releases. The colors and picture are crisp, and the sound is clear. The Special Features on Disc 2 are well-made and have at least a few moments which should delight most viewers (watch close for Gandalf saying ""Bollocks!"" in a featured outtake). The National Geographic special included on Disc 2 was a pretty interesting examination of how characters and events in ""Lord of the Rings"" mirror historical events and personages, such as William Wallace and Theodore Roosevelt. The two ""Making Of"" features are both good, but they have quite a bit of overlapped material. The featurettes are interesting but not particularly deep.
The film itself is simply a masterpiece, and worth buying this DVD just by itself. The Special Features are just gravy, really.
And now, finally, I can watch the whole thing, from beginning to end, in a nine-hour marathon!
Of course, I fully expect that the Extended Edition DVD to be released late 2004 will be an improvement upon this film, but for now, this version is more than good enough, and I'll be watching it at least a few more times. It's just too good!",1085529600,,1677,4.887719298245614
7274802,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Being a ""Lord of the Rings"" (LotR) die-hard, I was really concerned that the ending of ""Return of the King"" (RotK) would not be like the book where Sam comes home and says ""Well, I'm back."" Well, the movie was true to the book. For first-time viewers, the ending of the movie is kinda like three endings, but it was necessary for those of us who love these books.
Having read the books 9 times and read just about every other book on Tolkien and listened to all the radio plays, my expectations were very high for Peter Jackson's trilogy. He did not disappoint. After the first one, I knew we were (finally) in for a real treat. The last one is at least as good as the others. I saw this 5 times in the theaters (the first hour six times, but the IMAX version was too loud for my son). The transfer to DVD is very good and is good for any library.",1085529600,,847,4.13939393939394
7274803,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"The Return of the King marks the end to the best trilogy ever made. Peter Jackson and his team got it right with the first two films, and they outdid themselves by combining the best elements of those films, multiplying them by 50, and putting them into this film for an incredible climactic ending to the trilogy. The story is the most emotional and human of the three films (although ""Fellowship"" comes close). The special effects and action sequences are the best in not only all three of these films, but of all time.
What can I say about the DVD? Well first, the quality is absolutely stunning for the film. The picture is nice and crisp, with every color being as vibrant as it should be. The sound is once again in 5.1 Surround, so we get an awesome experience during the action sequences. Nothing was sacrificed in the quality of the film.
I didn't give this DVD 5 stars simply because while the movie itself is a 5 star film, the special features aren't as good as the features on the theatrical version DVDs of the first two films, and those weren't even that great. They like to save all the good extra features for the extended cut DVD sets that come out during the holidays. Even so, the theatrical version DVDs of films 1 and 2 still had some special features that this one does not, and these specific features are what I looked forward to the most with these releases. With this DVD, there's no preview of it's corresponding extended cut coming out in December like there was for the first two films. And there's no Annie Lennox music video. The theatrical releases of the first two films on DVD had both previews of their extended cuts as well as a music video for the main theme song. This one does not. Plus, while the National Geographic documentary is informative and interesting, it was released as a single DVD when the film came out in theaters. So if you already bought that, then it's inclusion on this DVD isn't anything special.
I did enjoy the first two documentaries on this DVD, although both repeat some of the same interviews and such. But there were things there that I've never seen before, and they were interesting.
So if you only want to buy a Return of the King DVD with tons of unique special features, wait for the extended cut that comes out during the holiday season. You'll get an hour extra of footage added back into the film, plus two whole discs of special features. But, if you're like me, needing something to hold you over until the extended edition release, go ahead and cough up the $20 (or less) cost for this release if you plan to watch it again and again so that December doesn't seem that far away. :)",1085529600,,2659,4.473251028806584
7274804,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Return of the King hits you on more emotional levels than either of the first two films.  The viewer is intensely drawn into to the characters of Frodo, Sam, Merry & Pippin.  This movie belongs to the Hobbits!
Naturally, Jackson has included everyone yet it seems the 'minor' characters own this tale.
Eowyn (Miranda Otto) is not only breathtaking but finally shows off her inner courage.  Theoden (Bernard Hill) is splendid, more animated, more a part of Tolkien's world in ROTK than in 'Two Towers'.  Gimli (John Rys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) are two major figures who while they share Aragorn's intense journey of self-discovery 'don't' figure much in the film.
Viggo Mortenson is even more credible as a man on the verge of greatness.  He has found his comfort level in this conclusion of the trilogy and does it with a soft-spoken style and intelligence.
Yet, primarily, ROTK is an emotional film about friendship and relationships.  Sean Astin (Sam) and Ejiah Wood's (Frodo) bond reaches a height most of us could only dream of.  Astin is fantastic, as he suffers along with Frodo. And Gollum reaches new heights of treachery as he guides the two Hobbits to Mt. Doom.
I cried in the theater and I sniffled at home with these characters so brought to life by Jackson's wonderful direction.
This is a movie for the ages.  The viewer can 'almost' forget the special effects for the trust, friendship and yes, fellowship that abounds in Return of the King.",1085443200,,1468,4.844
7274805,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I've read through several of the reviews and noticed some horrible mis-ratings of the movie.
This is a truly unjust action.
The movie is an epic that stretches across genre and demographic limits.  It applies to everyone today, from the mugger on the street to the preacher in the church.  The basic elements here are friendship and Good vs. Evil.  When you see the inserted scene of Sam and Frodo parting ways, you can not honestly say it did not jerk a little tear.  The only friendship that is truly held close together the whole movie broken up by corruption and greed.
Also with the Good vs. Evil, this is the main plot of the movie.  Sauron's dark forces wanting to destroy everything in Middle-Earth and turn it all into darkness versus the free people of Middle-Earth.  It is a clash of the armies of Darkness against the army of the ""Light"" so-to-speak.
Also to those that are bashing such areas as the ghost and the ending.
The ghost were once a powerful army led by Isildur, but they ran out on him and for that he cursed them to never rest until they fulfill their promise to help Gondor.  Aragorn purposesly goes into the Paths of the Dead to begin to reclaim who he is and to let the ghost fulfill their promise and be set free.
The ending was there for a reason.  People wanted a happy ending,  that's obvious.  Several people I have talked to consider this a sad ending.  While it is in some aspects, it's not in others.  Yes, Sam loses his best friend in the world and the Elves all leave Middle-Earth because the magic begins to fade.  Yet through all this you see Samwise happy with his wife and Bilbo gets to see a place untouched by time before he dies.
Just watch the movie carefully and you will come out changed.",1085443200,,1736,4.4043887147335425

I was at the local 24 hr retailer at the stroke of midnight to get my copy...and I stayed up until 3 am watching the best scenes.  One thing I did notice was that I picked up on a LOT more stuff going on while watching the DVD as opposed to seeing it in the theater.  There is so much action going on, that it is impossible to see everything on the big screen.  I was highly impressed at the quality of the picture on the DVD....and there seemed to be no defects.  All of the actors are wonderful....and I am especially getting a good appreciation for Viggo Mortensen and Orlando Bloom!  :)  I am sorry...I still like the baddies though....Sauron is the absolute best!  I am really looking forward to the extended edition DVD when the Mouth of Sauron shows up to fight Aragorn at the beginning of the last climactic battle at the gates of Mordor.  The Mouth of Sauron was left out of the theatrical version, and you can tell when watching it.  So, it will be great to see that battle...and the battles between Saruman and Gandalf (the infamous deleted scene)...and the battle between the Witch King and Gandalf where he will lose his staff.

It was the shining performance of this film. This movie is the most emotionally moving part of the trilogy.

Basically it picks up from ""Two Towers"" where you find Frodo and Sam getting closer to Mt Doom to finally destroy the ring of power and rid middle earth of evil. Elijah and Sean do a great job in taking us with them on their journey. i felt like i was the 4th person there thats how perfect the acting was. But i strongly suggest if you haven't seen the first 2 then don't watch this 1 because you won't have a clue on whats going on.
so definately worth owing in any DVD library even if its not the extended version.",1085443200,,836,4.166666666666667

The battle scenes was already done in the second movie.  There isn't a lot of character development at all.  Did anyone notice that none of the main characters ever got hurt?  Not even a scratch in all the battle scenes?  To my mind, this movie cannot stand on its own without the first two movies.  A movie that is the best movie of all time should be able to do so.  This wasn't the best movie of the year.  That honor and the oscar should have gone to Mystic River.  If memory serves me right, it also won an oscar for best editing.  If this is right, then that is a laugh.  Check the ever ending ending as an example why I say this.  Star Wars 4 should have been the first special effects movie to win the best picture oscar.

7274813,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"""The Return Of The King"" is the perfect ending to the most outstanding movie trilogy EVER made. ""Return"" picks up right where ""Two Towers"" leaves off (as did part 2 leave off perfectly from part 1). Frodo's journey to Middle-Earth concludes where he must destroy the Ring of Power. The Tolkien classic stays true to the story and director Peter Jackson paints the silver screen as if he's Rembrandt himself. The entire cast is back... Elijah Wood (as the Hobbit Frodo), Sean Astin (as Frodo's trusted friend Sam), Viggo Mortensen (as the destined king Aragorn), Orlando Bloom (as the elf archer Legolas), Ian McKellon (as wizard Gandalf), and Gollum/Smeagol (the computer animated schizo tour guide leading Frodo & Sam to Mordor). ""Return Of The King"" is a huge movie of epic proportions. Huge sets, incredible scenery, amazing costumes, a huge cast, and huge computers holding huge amounts of memory for all those eye popping computer-generated effects. The battle scenes are some of their fiercest I've ever seen... and the Dark Lord Sauron and the grunts that make up his army are what some people's nightmares are made of. This movie is about friendship, trust and inner strength... and about three-and-a-half hours long. The 2nd disc features 2 documentaries, a ""making of"" special, a ""National Geographic"" special, a ""Quest Fulfilled"" commentary from Peter Jackson, and an incredible trilogy ""supertrailer"". Easily the best movie of 2003 (earning 11 Oscar nominations and winning 11 Oscars)... and hands down the best trilogy ever put to film (the complete trilogy earned a record 30 Oscar nominations). Fact: ""The Return Of The King"" brought in two hundred and fifty million ($$) on it's first weekend of release. Awesome movie and a MUST HAVE for any DVD library.",1085443200,,1771,5.0893470790378

Theres no point in even reviewing this film, its an above average beautifully crafted piece of cinema that concludes one of the greatest stories of all time. But THIS dvd release? The sound and picture quality are about as good as can get, but the extra features are pretty useless. Infact the first two documentaries ""The Quest Fulfilled: A Director's Vision"" and ""A Filmmaker's Journey: Making The Return of The King"" use so many of the same images and snipets of interviews that they are almost identicle. They even have the same basic structure.
It all depends on how much your into the trilogy, if you enjoyed the movie and want to own it, theres nothing wrong with this release, if your LOVED the trilogy then rent this one, watch the feature and the extras and wait for the extended edition, that will be the version worth owning.",1085443200,4,883,4.594936708860759
7274815,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"In scale, ambition and extensive use of the latest CGI digital effects, director, Peter Jackson's ""The Return of the King"" effectively brings to a close his awe-inspiring adaptation of J.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings.""  Tying up the loose ends: Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) prepare for their massive battle at Minas Tirith; Frodo's (Elijah Wood) mission to Mordor grows more dark and sinister as he nears the molten lava of Mount Doom; Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) confronts Gollum in the most compelling and subtly nuanced digital manipulation. There are a couple of curiosities, including the inexplicable absence of Saruman (Christopher Lee) who will appear in the extended version DVD at a later date, and the reduction of several roles that were previously rather weighty, to mere cameo status.  Jackson had a lot of ground to cover in this final installment and his editorial acumen was working overtime. The film is slick and polished, masterfully told and faithful to Tolkien's vision.  Still, ""The Return of the King"" does tend to suffer from too many endings in its attempt to be loyally inclusive to all of the characters.
THE TRANSFER: Stunning. No less was to be expected and no less is offered in this beautifully rendered picture. Truly, there is nothing to complain about in this anamorphically enhanced presentation. Colors are stylized, bold, rich and vibrant. Contrast and shadow delineation is nicely rendered. Blacks are deep, rich and solid with an incredible amount of fine detail present, even during the darkest scenes and battle sequences.  The audio is 5.1 and extremely powerful. The rich musical score sweeps across all audio channels with an enveloping presence. Dialogue is very dimensional.
EXTRAS: As with the previous two films, this one comes with a host of extra features, including three substantial documentaries (the National Geographic one being the best) and six extremely short ""featurettes"" which  play more like extended trailers for the film.
BOTTOM LINE: Is this the BEST PICTURE of last year? Arguably, yes. It certainly is a fitting conclusion to the trilogy and an exceptional DVD presentation for your home theater. Add this one to your collection today.",1085443200,,2284,5.2465753424657535
7274816,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Acclaimed director Peter Jackson closes the final chapter to his award-winning fantasy epic with the astonishing blockbuster ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"". As Sauron's ring poisons Frodo's (Elijah Wood) soul, Sam (Sean Astin) aids his cursed friend against the many dangers of the dark land of Mordor, but the devilish Gollum plots against them to steal back his precious ring. With their fate in the hands of their two hobbit friends, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) unite the armies of Middle Earth against the fearsome legions of the Dark Lord. ""The Return of the King"" is a spectacular edge-of-your-seat masterpiece from the creative minds of Peter Jackson and his top-notch crew. This exciting fantasy spectacle features a powerful and moving story, memorable characters, a rich music score and strong emotional subplots. Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin and Ian McKellen deliver some fine performances. Its thrilling action sequences and amazing special effects are incredibly breathtaking. The gripping battle of Gondor is a remarkable heart-pounding visual achievement to behold.

7274818,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I have read the trilogy twice, and I saw this film in the theater three times, each instance surrounded by moviegoers completely enamored with everything in this film.  There was communal laughter and even applause.  So I pose the question again: How could anyone give this film less than 5 stars?  This is what all films should aspire to be: extraodinary filmmaking with incredible entertainment value.  I knew, after so much that was in the book ""The Two Towers"" was saved for the finale, that the third film was going to be amazing!  The cast received the Screen Actors Guild award for outstanding performance as a whole, and in the end the film won all 11 Oscars in which it was nominated.  After ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" lost both Best Picture and Best Director(blasphemy!!!), and ""The Two Towers"" was also passed over, it was genuinely surprising to see ""The Return of the King"" showered with Oscars.  As a film on its own, ""The Return of the King"" is the closest to a flawless film since ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in 1962.  There has not been a film series like this, affecting viewers on a cultural level, since the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy.  The visual effects in this film, in particular, are huge.  This film is a benchmark for all future CGI effects.  In a theater setting(first time viewers must see this on a large-screen television) the visual effects are overwhelming.  There was another surprise in the third film that was absent from the first two films: singing.  In the books there is poetry and song throughout and it was a welcome and excellent addition to the epic grandeur of the film.  Without a doubt, this is a 5 star film.  Those who disagree should be subjected to psychoanalysis due to obvious insanity.",1085356800,4,1736,4.701986754966887

7274820,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"One of the best movies of this era easily. If you have been reading other reviews then the upsides are almost a given: astounding CGI, huge battle scenes, amazing portrayal of Gollum and Shelob, truly emotional endings etc... But just for my take on these things here we go.
Many have said that the CGI in these movies is just annoying,obvious, or ugly. I whole heartedly disagree with this claim because in my opinion CGI is the only way to realize tolkiens words on scree. Tolkien describes hundreds of thousands of orcs attacking minas tirith, how in the world could that be done practically? Hire the entire population of wellington, NZ? Probably not. Also, shelob looks magnificent and would not look so realitic if she was rubber or a puppey. Gollum continues to amaze me now with even more facial structure and small detatails not seen in TTT that truly add to his believabilty and make him just another actor. Serkis conveys great emotion and character in Gollum in the film making him one of my faveorite characters.
As for the emotion of the film it is really amazing. I am not an outwardly emotional person but i had tears in my eyes during sam and frodos scenes in Minas Morgul and Mount Doom.
Now then, after reading some of the bad reviews of this title i just want to interject some thought on the ""bad"" things about this movie.
First of all Saruman being cut is not necassarily smart but if you want to see him then rent the extended cut coming out at the end of this year. He was obviosly not impotrtant to this part of the story. Infact in the books he tries to persuade people to join him but gandalf breaks his staff and wormtongue throws the palentir which is the only part of this scene which changes the story in any way. Therefore it was not a hard scene to cut.
Also the houses of healing must be on the extended cut as well and unless you care a lot about seeing another reasons Aragorn is the rightful king they arn't needed by the non tolkien enthusiest.
As to people who complain about how easily the orcs were defeated with the coming of the Army of the Dead, it was made a necassary change from the books by the screenwriters. First of all, in the book there was an Army but they only conquered the ports where the Black Ships of Umbar were in order to allow Aragorn and co with i belive at least a thousand new troops recruited from surrounding villages to take said ships to the battle. However tolkien had a bit less Orcs at the battle allowing this small troop to being the reason for Saurons defeat. Jackson upped the number a bit meaning he needed the army of the dead to win the battle. These are the reasons (pretty resonable reason in my opinion) for the triumph of the Army of the dead.
I only list these faults becuase i wanted to explain to people who are angered by them why they shouldn't be.
Anyway brief summary of what to expect from the movie: Aragorn Legolas, Gandalf and Gimli must travel to Minas Tirith stronghold of men to prepare for battle against Sauron. While this is happening Frodo Sam and Gollum travel through Minas morgul on their way to try to destroy the one ring of power and bring down the evil in Middle-earth.
The theatrical DVD is not the definitive version but if you are like me you will buy it anyway just for the small amount of behind the scenes stuff and the movie itself to own it for four months before buying the EE in November with at least 10 hrs of behind the seens
So all in all wonderful movie mostly true to the books and amazing visual effects. BUY IT",1085356800,6,3537,4.3932926829268295
7274821,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This is the greatest movie ever made in my opinion.  To see these books come to life was indeed a small miracle to me.  Peter Jackson knows how to bring out the best in his actors.  If you are afraid to delve too deeply into the books or don't have the time.  Watch the movies, but make sure you get the extended versions and watch them at least three times to get the full impact of middle earth.  Then read read read the books.

I was skeptical about seeing the Lord of the Rings trilogy at first because I heard it was about ""Dungeons and Dragons"". Well, if this is D & D, sign me up. This is, without a doubt, the most intriguing and fantastic movie and series I have ever seen. I have watched the first two films as Platinum edition series on DVD over 50 times already and I will continue to watch them for some time to come. I have more than 100 DVDs and I always come back to LOTR DVDs every time. After watching them I can't even imagine watching anything else. I never thought I would enjoy this type of movie, but the overall development and production of these films is an absolute masterpiece. Peter Jackson is a genius.

7274823,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"I can accept a movie treatment compressing a book's dialog or leaving out scenes to make a story watchable in under three hours.  We've all got to go the bathroom eventually, after all.  What I can't understand is why Peter Jackson would actually *add* scenes and new fluff dialog to this already interminably long movie.  We get scenes of Liv Tyler as Arwen emoting with her father Elrond, Gollum successfully driving a wedge between Frodo and Sam (Say it isn't so!), Aragorn et al. in a battle of words with the spirits of the mountains and on and on.  And pretty much all the scenes from Tolkien's wonderful original are padded with useless new dialog.
Someone out there is bound to say, ""Jackson was just developing characters!  He was exploring with them in new directions!""  In many other movies, I could accept this.  But if you are going to ""explore"" and ""develop"" the work of an author like Tolkien, you should ask yourself a couple of questions.  Like, ""Do I feel lucky?""  But, more importantly, ""Can my writers really write like Tolkien?""  The dialog from the new scene with Arwen and Elrond sounded like it was written for ""The Young and the Elvish,"" and the spot with Frodo and Sam breaking up was straight out of ""As Middle Earth Turns.""  I almost expected Frodo to snarl, ""If I can't have the ring, no one can!""  The scene with Aragorn and the mountain spirits put more corn on the screen than you can find in the entire state of Iowa.
The mountain spirits scene was dreadful in pretty much all other aspects as well.  It looked just like Disney's Haunted Mansion.  (I don't mean the movie.  I mean the ride in Orlando.)  And Jackson's ""exploration"" of Aragorn's character here is inexcusable.  Tolkien's Aragorn had some trepidation about the task to which he was called, but he faced it through and through with manly courage.  If Jackson's Aragorn had waffled any more, we would have had to douse the screen with maple syrup.  Why Jackson gave this role to Viggo Mortensen instead of  Woody Allen is beyond me.
The real crime here is that, to make room for this fluff, Jackson had to leave out some of Tolkien's most powerful scenes.  Gone is the final meeting of Gandalf and Saruman at Isengard.  I figured Jackson would put that in as an excuse for more sceptre-fu like we saw in the first movie.  Gone also is Gandalf confronting the Nazgul at the gate of Gondor.  Given the apparent appetite of Jackson or his FX crew for ""over the top"", I thought they would be like kids in a candy store here.  Maybe it was the PC reflex that led Jackson to give this scene to Eowyn the maid of Rohan.  The dialog between her and the Nazgul is truly Shakespearean:
Nazgul: ""Do not come between a Nazgul and his prey!  No man can kill me!""
Eowyn: ""But I am no *man*.""
(Cue music: Helen Reddy's  ""I Am Woman.  Here Me Roar."")
Missed most of all, the scouring of the Shire is completely gone.  I know this scene would be a little slow for the typical targeted audience of big budget cinema, i.e. over caffienated teeny boppers, but it was integral to Tolkien's story of a world where magic was disappearing and men (and Hobbits) would have to learn to live by their wits and their courage.
But back to the Nazgul, his helmet looked like something Sauron had jury-rigged to pick up illegal satellite TV.  And his dialog, whether with Eowyn or with the Orcs under his command, was just stock action-movie bad-guy lines.  (""I will break him!"") But the real problem was that he just shouldn't have been given lines to say, or any close-ups either.  Tolkien showed us the forces of evil almost always, to borrow a theological term, ""from below.""  We hardly ever saw them ""in themselves"" but only as they were perceived by the frightened soldiers and hobbits.  This left them shrouded in a dark cloud of mystery that made them all the more terrifying.  The film's close-ups of the Nazgul and the orcs and so on exchanges the fear that can be generated by the imagination for cheap thrills at how great the movie's FX crew and costumers were.
I have to hand it to Jackson, I was really surprised that he actually tried to give the movie's ending some of the same melancholy that we get in Tolkien's original.  But, as with pretty much all the other scenes in the movie, it would have been so much more effective without the bad soap opera poetics that the writers felt compelled to add.
There was one shaft of sunlight piercing the Mordorean darkness of this film: Sean Astin's Samwise Gamgee.  Astin finally hits his stride in this last of the three LOTR movies.  His portrayal of the simple, tough, goodhearted hobbit called to do things he knows are beyond him is in perfect tune with the Sam Gamgee Tolkien gave us.  The Samwise he delivers really is the one that Tolkien created.  I have to wonder if Jackson was furious with him.
I have to give this crime of cinema at least one star for Sean Astin.  It gets a second star because, since it ends pretty much the way Tolkien's book ended, and since there are no reports of Jackson giving into the pecuniary temptation to create a sequel, it implictly promises to be the last movie in this horrible series.  (Please!  Leave The Silmarillion alone!)  The cloud of Mordor is dispersed.  The suffering has ended.  I just wish the Age of Men were dawning in big budget cinema, an age where writers and directors would have to rely on attracting audiences with emotion and imagination, instead of grabbing fast bucks from teeny boppers with FX magic.",1085097600,11,5496,4.561224489795919
7274824,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I just loved the return of the king. I am a true and very pleased fan with Peter Jackson's Trilogy, especially The Return of the king. The Plot is that The final battle for middle earth is about to begin and The battle takes place in the fields of the pelennor and The black gates of Mordor. This movie was a great experience, everything was just perfect as it was! Mostly nothing was wrong with it! The script was beautiful, The Lord of the rings trilogy was written by J.R.R Tolkein, a fantastic story writer and the script for the actual movie was supurb! It flowed so well with the sorroundings and it was easy to understand and comprehend and still get the emotion with it. The battle scenes were THE BEST! I just loved every minute of it. The special effects were so real and so exciting! So action packed ( though sometimes it can go allitle far but we still enjoy it....). I have been a Enormous fan for The score music for the return of the king and the music fitted so well, there was a mixture of slow but beautiful and heroic and energetic which, with the film made your back tingle in happiness :).
The acting was what made the film connect with so many people. It was realistic, not corny. Their eyes, their facial expression, I could feel their emotion, therefore, I cried like a baby 4 times and other people cried too in the cinema. When I was in the theaters, people were so engaged with the film, they started to Cheer. Some people would think this would be annoying BUT! bevause we now it is so good.. why not join them???
Emotion, music acting and realism, story are the key things that all directors should take account for... The return of the king has done all of this and this is ultimatly one of the most perfect epic films ever made. I just loved this film. fabulous.
The dvd is not worth getting unless you want just the theatrical stuff and don't bother with the extras. There are many things that P.J left out in Return of the king and waiting for the extended edition is something I cannot wait sitting still.
Overall, I have said it before, FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The flow of the film is boring without coming to a peak as the fellowship of the ring and two towers. In the fellowship of the ring, we got the set up of fellowship and fighting in the forest. it is good beginning showing the introduction to the whole story with great entertainment. For two towers, we saw a great battle to defense the castle. These are peaks in the films. But what we have in three? a more big castle and more oracle and men fighted and died.

  Since bringing these well loved books by JRR Tolkien to the screen was such a difficult process, it is understandable why it has gotten mixed reviews.  Jackson had to meet the expectations of Tolkien fans all over the world while still making a film viewable for those of us who aren't obssessed with Lord Of The RIngs.

When I viewed it on January 29, it was my second time seeing the movie in theatres. This story is about survival, friendship, good, and evil. This story takes place in Middle Earth. It is about the adventure of a hobbit named Frodo and his best friend Sam, who is also a hobbit, who are trying to get to Mount Doom to destroy an evil ring. This is the third and last movie in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. The special effects are amazing like all of the other movies. Even though it is a very long movie, it went past very fast. I was totally glued to the screen the whole time. Some little children might be scared of the violence, but I think it is really up to the parent to decide whether or not to take their child to this movie. I don't want to say much more because I want you to check out the movie for yourself. This movie without a doubt deserves five stars. There were absolutely no flaws during the whole movie. I hope everyone checks this movie out and enjoys it as much as I did.",1084838400,3,1100,4.0504587155963305
7274831,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The Lord of the Rings, probably the greatest movie in 40 years, original work of JRR Tolkien, movie version by Peter Jackson, is completed in this final movie. The Elven civilization stands on the brink of destruction. While immortal beings they suffer from the ""world weariness"" and the only thing sustaining them and their works are the Three Rings of Power. But the Three are bound up with the power of the One. If Sauron gets his Ring back, then the Three will become corrupted and the last defenses will fall. But if they succeed, and the One Ring destroyed, the Three will die too. The Elves are doomed either way, but they fight on. Their only real hope is to evacuate back to Heaven in the True West.
While the Elves hold Sauron back on the magic/psychic plane, it falls on the last cultural offspring of Elven-teaching, the human empire of Gondor, to hold Mordor and the hordes of the east back militarily. The Gondorian Empire, once the most powerful force on Earth has decayed over the millennia to a kind of proud, venerable, but increasingly impotent Byzantium. If Gondor falls, so falls the World.
But Sauron has already beaten the forces of good all the way back to the heartland and the ancient capital, Minas Tirith the White City! There, the High Kings of old ruled. But the old royal line passed away a thousand years ago and Gondor has since been under the control of the Ruling Stewards, who are none too keen on giving up the throne for the ""last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship."" That means Aragorn, last survivor of the old royal bloodline of Numenor, and heir to the crown.
Since the Elves are doomed to depart the world whether the war is won or lost it is vital that Minas Tirith survive and hold back the tide, not only for the sake of the Free Peoples of the world and because it is the last bastion of law and order, of art, skill and technology, but more importantly Gondor will be the last civilization to be taught the ""true"" religion, the perception of the Blessed Realm in the Uttermost West. In fact the White Tree of Gondor is a sapling of the original Silver Tree of Heaven...and the last physical link to the divine.
Knowing the history increases the beauty and potency of the films...to know what is REALLY at stake: the loss of the wisdom and awareness of heaven, the threat of the establishment of a demonic empire.
As Denethor, Ruling Steward of Gondor, prepares for the war that will almost certainly end his nation, our heros return from victory over the fallen Wizard Saruman. As they and the people of Rohan rest and ready for the next stage of the war Pippin sneaks a look at the recovered Palantir of Isengard and comes face to face with the utter horror of Sauron, who had corrupted the seeing-stone network long ago. Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to assist and give warning while Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas help King Theoden muster the full strength of Rohan to ride to the defense of the White City.
Gandalf and Pippin come to the capital and find Denethor in a kind of proud despair. Grief from the loss of his eldest son, Boromir, and knowledge from the Palantir of the White Tower about the awesome power of Sauron and the horror facing the certain doom of his civilization and all it's works was driving him to madness. Gandalf is forced to gradually assume command of the defense of the City.
Frodo, Gollum, and Sam (who is the true hero of the tale) continue to make their way into Mordor. They face the rocky mountains of Mordor, horror of Minas Morgul, the treachery of Gollum, and the dreadfulness of Shelob before they finally enter the Black Land. Their final enemies on the trek to Mount Doom are deadly thirst and hunger and the sleepless watch of the Lidless Eye of Sauron.
The forces of Evil have come to the City. The Great Gates of Gondor are broken and enemies poor under the archway that no enemy had ever passed before. Hope is lost...
But there are forces at work besides the will of Evil. And they have not totally forgotten or abandoned the World...and that is an encouraging thought.
Nothing can prepare you for the climax and the bittersweet epilogue...",1084838400,7,4151,4.550802139037433

I must say, the performances of each and every one of the actors and actresses were woeful, and truly disturbing, in the least. How this truly awful film came to win so many Academy Awards (TM) remains but a cryptic occurence in a world copious with hate. The excessive length induced a severe bowel movement, which eventually forced me to miss the last hour and tweleve minutes in the cinema loo.

7274834,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"Like abstract art, The Return of the King, I found, was the most pyschological of the triology.  Very intellectual yet subtle and moving, too. It focused more on ""what if"" scenarios, cleverly portrayed by a remarkably seasoned cast.  By ""what if"" I mean you imagine what could happen.  What could happen if Gollum succeeded in his plan? If Rohan fell? If the elves left, forever?  If Frodo failed?  If the steward of Gondor got the ring?
The movie, while lengthy, also had a certain aspect of quiet about it.  The fairtale-ness of the Twin Towers and the missionary aspect of the Fellowship of the Ring shift to a more thoughtful sense of duty, of honor, of setting things back to the right path.  I found a lot of dignity in Frodo and Sam's quest to climb Mt. Doom.  Gollum's tortured existence is more clearly defined; pity is more easily attributed to him as he plots to break Frodo's and Sam's relationship and prey on Frodo's vulnerabilities.  Gondor's steward is beautifully portrayed as the utterly unfair, ambitious and elegant madman.
While the ending was predictable (even for those who have not read the book) there is quiet power to this movie.  The fellowship still exists.  The mission is accomplished.  Love reunites; peace is reassembled; calm and order reign freely.
I highly recommend this movie.  The cast is noble.  The dialogue more serious.  The consequences of failure more concrete.  Like poetry, the movie makes you think and pleasantly lingers in your thoughts as it teaches.  Kudos on a job well done.",1084752000,7,1528,4.837837837837838
7274835,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The wait is finally over as the closing chapter in this masterful Trilogy from Peter Jackson makes its DVD release, and boy was it worth it.
For those who didn't see the movie on the big screen, this will be worth waiting for, and the 11 Oscars that were bestowed on it were more than well deserved, although I felt this was a reflection on the entire trilogy as a whole, and not just this last installment.
I'm not one for plot spoiling so enough to add that Sam & Frodo continue there quest with Gollum in tow, whilst Aragorn tries to fulfill his destiny amidst an epic battle, and the culmination of the story from the last two movies is beautifully woven together. Maligned by some for being a little protracted toward the end, and running over 3hrs and 15 minutes this is certainly filmed on an epic scale. Some criticism from purists with regard to the transition from page to screen, were I feel also a little misplaced as this will surely become known as the definitive version of a great work of literature, and is in it's own right cinematic history at over 4 years in the making.
This film (like the two that preceded it) has everything: - love, action, adventure, emotion, sadness and the list goes on. Superbly acted, directed, and written, I cannot recommend this film enough. Those who enjoyed the other movies will feel more than a little sadness at the end of this trilogy, which although it seemed frustrating at having to wait a year for each installment to come along, has left us without anything to seemingly look forward too. Some excellent DVD extra's on disc two, including the promotion of the extended version later this year round out the disc set well, and this will certainly be a worthy addition to any collection. Enjoy",1084406400,2,1751,4.579617834394904
7274836,2,B00Z9YZRVE,"I should probably begin this review with a confession: I've only seen this movie once, several months ago, upon it's initial release.  Why would this matter, you ask.  Well, I went only after reading numerous reviews placing this film among the greatest cinematic achievements of all-time, and my expectations were naturally sky high.  So, I suppose that it was all too inevitable that I would wind up disappointed.  The problem is, I actually liked the first two films and felt this, it's concluding chapter, was a real letdown.
Now, I understand that it's unfair to hold the movie's failure to live up to my expectations against it, but that's the reality of the situation.  All I had heard for months leading up to ""Return's"" release was how awe-inspiring the final battle scene was going to be, and how it would blow away everything that we've seen in the previous two movies.  But when I actually saw it, I found myself asking, ""Was that it?""  And that's a question that you're libel to be asking yourself quite often as the movie seems to end about a half dozen different times.
What the film does have going for it is that it's almost three and a half hours long, but doesn't feel a minute over two.  Now, that's quite a feat in it of itself and would normally be enough to earn this film a three star review on the basis of that fact alone.
But getting back to the movie itself, I should probably mention what a phenomenal performance is given by Sean Astin, arguably the best of his career.  Much of the final film is placed on his shoulders, and he ably carries the weight of an epic, a feat I would have never imagined him capable of just a few years ago.  And at the end of the day it's he, Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis who are the ones primary responsible for giving these three movies their most important ingredient: humanity.",1084320000,4,1841,4.501501501501502

7274838,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"This is easily the 'best' of Peter Jackson's tacky and over-produced trilogy. The characters come off as less dimwitted than in 'Fellowship Of The Ring' and there is far less deviation from the book, the plot of which works just fine, as in 'The Two Towers'.
However, once again Jackson, Ms. Jackson & Ms. Boyens contrive to jettison beautiful dialogue penned by Tolkien & to replace it with Hollywood rubbish. For instance, in Tolkien, upon King Theoden's death:
MERRY
Forgive me lord, if I have broken your command, and yet have done no more in your service than to weep at your parting.
THEODEN
It is forgiven. Great heart will not be denied. Live now in blessedness and when you sit in peace with your pipe, think of me.
In the movie it is Eowyn, Theoden's niece, who recieves his death words, which are taken verbatim from 'Return of the Jedi' for some unfathomable reason. Merry and Pippen trade Hollywood dialogue: ""I knew you'd find me!"" etc...
Elsewhere: the ghostly warriors summoned by Aragorn look like escapees from the Haunted Mansion in Disneyland; King Denethor is turned into a pathetic whining pansy; one anonymous CGI battle is followed by another until you can hardly stand it anymore; Gimli is reduced to a comic afterthought; the last hour is almost entirely shot in slow motion; every inch of film is underscored by heavyhanded music etc...
Having said the above, this is the most involving of the three films, despite its apalling and unnecessary 3 1/2 hour length.
Peter Jackson is a hack - a hack of near unlimited energy and creative resources. He has stretched the dollar farther than it has ever gone before in cinema history and I suppose he deserves every dime and accolade he's recieved for completing this unlikey pop-culture watermark. However, he'll not be remembered for subtlety or insight, two things which Tolkien possessed in spades.",1084147200,45,1873,4.87460815047022
7274839,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"NOTE: SEE OTHER 2 MOVIES IN ORDER BEFORE SEEING THIS ONE!!!!!The greatest movie trilogy of all time comes to an end in this spectacular movie.  I gave this movie 5 stars for a reason.  Years ago I heard everyone talking about this new movie coming out called the Lord of the Rings.  Personally I had never heard of the movie or even the books.  Before I went to the first movie, I read the first book.  After I saw the movie, I immediately read the 2nd and 3rd books.  These movies are powerful and exciting.  During half of this movie my mouth was hanging wide open.  I couldn't help it!  I tried eatcing popcorn and my jaw wouldn't shut to chew it.  I couldn't even drink my pop.  I was shocked and amazed at how many actors that I had never heard of could make a powerful book into an awesome movie.  The only actor in this movie I had ever heard of was Ian Mckellen and his appearance in X-Men.  But did that make a difference?  Heck no.  Let me get to what the movie is actually about.
This movie starts out with a part that is actually written in the Fellowship of the Ring.  It was never put in until now.  At the very beginning it tells how Gollum came to be.  Then it picks up right where the Two Towers left off.  People were disappointed with the fact that last time they didn't get to see Shelob.  That was one of the main reasons I wanted to go and I was mad that she wasn't there (in the books she is in the Two Towers).  Waiting one more year was well worth it as Frodo and Sam battle the enormous spider trap that was set up by Gollum.  Gollum earns Frodo's trust in this movie and Sam doesn't trust Gollum at all.  Also, as Frodo and Sam move closer to Mordor, Sauron's ever-watchful eye is scanning Mordor.  So, Aragorn and Co. lead an army to the Black Gate to distract Sauron.  Then, Frodo starts giving out and Sam carries him to the cavern inside Mount Doom.  Here you can see what becomes of the ring and Gollum.  Barad Dur meets its match and Sauron along with it.  Bring some tissues along at the end.  I'm not gonna say anything about it.  See the movie or read the last chapter in the book to find out.
I was disappointed that the Scouring of the Shire (read the book) was left out.  That was one of my personal favorite chapters (Sam is a stud in that chapter).  The hobbits take back the Shire in that chapter.  Here's how I rate the movie:
Ratings out of 5.

Visual Effects: 5
Score (sound and music): 5

Gandalf and Pippen (Billy Boyd) travel to Minas Tirith to try to convince the city's self-absorbed Steward of the impending peril. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), and Rohan's King Theoden (Bernard Hill) lead Rohan's armies toward Minas Tirith, where they will make their stand against the advancing Armies of Mordor. Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) have penetrated the borders of Mordor and continue to make their way toward Mount Doom, guided by the treacherous Gollum, as Frodo struggles under the weight of the Ring's burden.
With this final chapter in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, director Peter Jackson brings the story to its conclusion in spectacular fashion worthy of the first two installments. The ability to maintain quality across three movies may largely be due to their being filmed continuously with no breaks or regrouping between the three films. ""The Return of the King"" is the longest of the three films at 3 hours 15 minutes. And that is where I find fault with it. The opening sequence serves no purpose, and the final act, which is a sort of epilogue, seems to go on endlessly and say very little. The camera work is conspicuously languorous as well. In dramatic scenes the camera often lingers in one place so long that the audience may grow impatient and wonder offhandedly if it is stuck. A half hour could have easily been trimmed from this film without any detrimental effect, and it should have been. There will be plenty of room for extraneous material on the ""Extended Edition"" DVD. Apart from that, ""The Return of the King"" is a satisfying and rousing conclusion to ""The Lord of the Rings"" epic. The battle sequences are spectacular. The visual effects are impressive. And the cast is wonderful. Ian McKellan's and Viggo Mortensen's commanding onscreen presence befits their mythical characters. And I have to admire Sean Astin's portrayal of Samwise Gamgee  more than any other performance in the trilogy. ""The Return of the King"" is cornier than either of its predecessors, and it is extremely sentimental. Sometimes that's laid on a bit thick, but it's to be expected in a concluding chapter, and it isn't unlike the book on which it is based. The pace of ""The Return of the King"" more closely resembles ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" than ""The Two Towers"", and its attention to the Hobbits does as well. ""The Two Towers"" remains my favorite film of the trilogy because I prefer its swift pace, and, even though I was obsessed with Tolkien's books as a child, I was never fond of Hobbits. If you like Hobbits, they are back in the center of the action in ""The Return of the King"". Screenwriter Frances Walsh has admirably accomplished the superhuman task of condensing JRR Tolkien's books into workable screenplays. I always felt that the book ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was superior to ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"". And I don't think that the film ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" captured that book's themes. On the other hand, I believe the films of ""The Two Towers"" and ""The  Return of the King"" have, if anything, improved on the books, and Frances Walsh is due the credit. Peter Jackson, Frances Walsh, and thousands of cast and crew have created a cinematic event  in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which people of all ages and cultures will be watching for centuries to come.

7274846,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Here at long last is Peter Jackson's triumphant conclusion to his LOTR trilogy.  I first saw the film on opening day, but it has taken me this long to be able to write about it for many reasons.  The first of these is that I needed to absorb the story more fully, even though I read the book previous to seeing all of the films.  The second is that I wanted to write my own thoughts, without being influenced by what others thought.  So here goes...

With Return of the King, we are given a fuller representation of the dynamics between the many characters who we have met and followed over the course of the previous two films.  At the center of the movie in terms of powerful performances are Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn/King Elessar, Ian McKellen as Gandalf the White, and Sean Astin as Sam and Elijah Wood as Frodo, respectively.  Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are also great, as are Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto.  There are many wonderful scenes, including the Ride of the Rohirrim, Gandalf comforting Pippin during the siege on Minas Tirith, Sam showing us why he's an underrated character at the foot of Mt. Doom, and the beautiful, visually and emotionally stunning coronation scene.  The real punch comes, though, at the Grey Havens, the most visually beautiful and truly heartbreaking scene I can recall in a film.

To those who say that the film has too many endings, the ending comes out of the book, and the important thing is that we see the final fate of our hobbit heroes.  The Trilogy would have lost focus without it.  This film catapults the trilogy into my all time top 5 (exact number to be determined).  Final grade: A+",1083628800,4,1643,4.566552901023891

From the beginning of the series, it seems Jackson was able to enter Tolkien's mind and bring to the big screen the beautiful and colorful Middle-Earth and its different characters.
And now, the trilogy is completed. In the end, with what are we, Ring fans, left with? This third movie seems to me the apotheosis of all epic movies. Excellent acting, brilliant direction, characters we all want to be acquainted with, special effects that left me with a hanging jaw (the scene in Aragog's cave was one of the most impressive I've ever seen, the Minas Tirith battle, the oliphants, and many, many more).
After watching the final scene in ""The return of the king"", what I find most striking is the commitment Jackson (and crew)  and his actors showed from the beginning of the project. I mean, ""Lord of the rings"" is an epic with a huge scale, and has legions of (demanding) fans all over the world. This could be a total flop. Thank God it's not. In the end, after two years of shootings, editings and such (and two years of waiting for us, viewers) the movie trilogy of Lord of the Rings is something that will never be forgotten. Of course it's different, in some parts and aspects, from the books, but to transform a written story into a visual one is never an easy task. This Jackson did. With a touch of genious.
Fantastic entertainment, this is the best part of the trilogy; those three hours passed in a flash.

This film combined the amazing battle scenes of ""The Two Towers"" with the moving character work of ""Fellowship of the Ring"".  It deserved every one of the 11 Oscars that it won (the first film to get more than 10 nominations and to win each of its nominations).  The special effects are incredible, and Sean Astin really shines in his role of Sam.
If you liked the first two films of the series, and if you liked the books, this film should be a real treat for you, just as it was for me.  The trilogy will go down as, quite possibly, the best, most complete trilogy in all of film, and this chapter of it is the best.",1082851200,3,1037,4.238578680203045
7274854,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I could not agree more with the 11 Oscar wins for this incredible masterpiece that Peter Jackson has created.  I saw the theatrical release five times, and am dying to see it many more.  Although I'm not the biggest fan of the books, Peter Jackson and the Lord of the Rings cast bring ""Return of the King"" to life better than any based-on-book movie I've ever seen.  This is truly the DVD to own this year and for many more years to come.",1082851200,2,438,4.253012048192771
7274855,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The Return of the King is by far the best movie I had seen in a long long time. I cried many a time and sometimes laughed through my tears. The emotional rollercoaster that is the Return of the King is truely an expierence that you just cannot pass up. Pippin, played by Billy Boyd, wrenched my heart when he sang the Steward of Gondor. Also, the true hero to the story is Sam,played by Sean Astin. When Frodo tells Sam to go home was another heart breaker for me and I cried till he found Frodo again. I must also give credit to Merry (Dominic Monaghan)because his bravery in battle was extremely noble. Gollum was an extremely important character in the trilogy, hard as you would like to hate him with all of your soul. However, without him the Ring never would have been destroyed. I must also say that if anyone was perfect for the role of Aragorn it would be Viggo Mortenson. Enough said, for he was THAT good. Gandalf remains the voice of truth in the trilogy. The humor that Legolas and Gimli bring is truely laugh out loud competition. All in all, I would have 2 say that anyone who doesnt see this film has lost out on a masterpiece.",1082764800,,1143,4.32093023255814
7274856,5,B00Z9YZRVE,This movie was without a doubt the best of the three even though it was the longest. It was just mind-blowing. The special effects were out of this world and there has never been a best ensemble in any ovie I have ever seen. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is absolutly my favorite movies of all time.,1082764800,,299,4.172413793103448
7274857,5,B00Z9YZRVE,Yeah I have to agree that Mr Money Bags is one of the biggest idiots in the world. To actually think that this is a rip off on Star Wars just goes to show how backwards his thinking is. If anything Star Wars is rip off on the Lord of the Rings. I mean you do know that it was a book written 40 years ago. And of course you have to have watched all the movies to understand the movie. Thats how the book was written. It was pretty much written as one giant book. And the effects were top notch. To have that many shots in a movie takes a lot of work. After reading your review I put my head in my hands and wept at what an idiot you are.,1082592000,5,636,3.753731343283582
7274858,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"I have to say, I was a little let down. I realize that Hollywood must alter and adapt books in order to logistically make them work on screen. Plus there are parts of the Return of the King novel that will bore you to tears. However, I was a little disappointed to have the scouring of the Shire cut... It just gives you that closure with Saruman that you really need. I also had a problem with the 9 endings that just seemed to go on and on and on... Really, we could've stopped with the ship sailing to the west with the nice sunset, but no, we get Sam's musings on family life in the Shire.
Okay, enough with the negative. This is a great movie. I can't give it five stars though, because it is only part of a whole, and to watch only Return of the King would leave you missing something. I suggest you do what I will do when this comes out on DVD. Take the Day off of work, watch the Expanded Editions of Fellowship and Two Towers, then pop this one in. Yes, that is ten hours of Tolkien, and it is likely that my eyes will rot out of my skull, but that is the way this was meant to be viewed.
My personal favorite, is the battle on the fields of Pelinnor. This was my favorite sequence from the book, and I think Peter Jackson did a wonderful job capturing it in detail. I don't like that he cut the romance between Faramir and Eowyn, but I think that's coming back from the cutting room for the Expanded edition. The stunning visual effects for Shelob reinforced my already ardent fear of spiders, and I absolutely love every screenshot and back drop employed.
Yes, I am a Tolkien nerd, but I can easily say that though there are some inconsistencies, no one could ever do a better job creating this cinematically than Peter Jackson and Co. has done. All three movies encapture the personalities of the characters, peoples, and lands of Middle Earth so that Tolkien would be proud. If you do not feel inspired to succeed when all hope is lost, then you have missed the entire point of the movie. If you do not stand up wanting to cleave the arms off the nearest orc, than you have missed the point. If, for the next week after seeing this, you do not walk around saying ""Stupid FAT Hobbit!"" then you just aren't human.
I love this trilogy.",1082592000,7,2245,4.259953161592506
7274859,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Before I saw this movie I've heard a lot of good things about it, so I must say that my expectations were high. Usually, when I feel like that the actual thing turns out to be worse than I expected. But ROTK didn't let me down. It was merely awesome! The cast was so well-picked, that there wasn't a slightest doubt in my mind that nobody else could've done a better job. Especially to me stood out Sam and Pippin. Billy Boyd just blew me away with his performance and how he showed the arc that Pipin's character had overgone.
Elijah Wood has done his job well also. He managed to capture both the evilness of his ring-possessed self and the pure innocence of his old self.
Visually the movie was captivating, the scenery and battles were grand and beautiful. And as bored as I usually get while watching the battle scenes, the ones here had nothing extra that would make, me at least, go to sleep.
The plotline was very intruiging, but rather sad at the middle. I cried at least 5 times during the movie, and that tops all other movie I've watched.
So, now I can only add, that this is a great movie, definatly one of the best movies made so far!",1082592000,3,1148,4.319444444444445

Usually, I see a trailer & if it is good, I think that would be a good book & am disappointed by the movie. I read this book because my family liked the 1st movie & I thought it would be a good book, but for once, I feel the movie is actually better than the book. There were so many points in the book that went off in tangents, but the movie lasts over 3 hours & left me wishing they had shown the scouring of the shire & the things left in the appendices. It absolutely needed all of the many endings & I would have loved to see more. I know why they were left out-for pacing reasons but miss them.",1082505600,2,692,3.8125
7274861,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Like so many LOTR fans, I was sobbing way before the end credits started rolling. I think the first tear fell at Aragorn's coronation and it kept going while at the same time getting louder.
I loved the multiple endings. It gave closure to many of the questions I had for I had never read the books (although I am doing that right now starting with ""The Hobbit""). Truthfully, I didn't want it to end. I was afraid for it to end. But when it did, I cried all the more harder. RotK <i>is</i> the most dramatic of the three. It really tears at your heart.
Although the movie is three hours long, it really just felt like it was only an hour and a half long. From the very beginning you're engrossed in the film. This movie is that captivating.
Favorite Shot: The Legolas ""hero"" shot, aka when he killed the oliphant and slid down its body. Ah, EXCELLENT!",1082246400,5,851,4.325

They are nothing like the book Sam jackson butchord the story. It would have been great if he had called it a remaging instead of lord of the rings. How can any one who has read all 4 books and I do not mean audio books. Even say these movies are close to the book don't get me wrong i loved them and I own them all but not worth a 5 star,1082160000,4,459,3.693877551020408
7274863,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This is such an excellent movie.  The basic themes of the story are classics: hope, friendship, courage.  This is the ultimate good vs. evil.  The fate of the world is in the hands of two of the most unlikely people, and they are struggling with little hope of survival.  Meanwhile, there friends are fighting what may seem to be equally hopeless battles.  Everyone is outnumbered, but they keep fighting.  But the movie is not just about the battle, it is about the people of Middle Earth.  Their struggles are so incredibly difficult, but they keep going.  We are brought right into their journeys, and experience their emotions.
The casting is excellent.  Elijah Wood as Frodo is one of the most exceptional young actors I have ever seen.  He is so emotional that you cannot help but feel his anguish.  And Viggo Mortenson as the soon-to-be king is such an excellent choice.  Even the supporting cast is stellar.  There is not a bad actor or a bad performance in the movie.
The special effects are incredible.  The crew put so much effort into the creation of this world that it is easy to forget it is all make-believe.  Each of the places they have created is detailed and flawless.  It is almost impossible to tell which armies are CG and which are real.  They have even included CG horses.
Everything comes together perfectly in this movie.  The score Howard Shore creates is so perfect for each scene.  The writers have adapted JRR Tolkien's words so well that I challenge anyone to find a better adaptation.  The actors have taken these words and played their parts magnificently.  And the crew have all done exactly what was necessary to make this a movie for the ages.  I can't imagine anyone missing this movie.",1082073600,4,1723,4.673333333333333
7274864,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Let me get a few things out of the way here: I have never read any of the books. I was lukewarm on the first movie, liked the second one, but I had seen better movies last year. This movie, though, was quite a ride. This movie certainly deserved its honors for Best Picture, such a moving and entertaining film it is. The Return of the King provides a coda to the Lord of the Rings series and ties up all the threads, there is one heck of an emotional payoff, although the end is tinged with melancholy. In terms of narrative power, it is unmatched among the series, and it keeps the action simultaneously epic and personal.
The plot, as you know, has the characters mainly split apart: Gandalf (Ian McKellan) is off to lead the troops against the armies of darkness, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson) tries to unite the various denizens of Middle Earth to band together to fend off the onslaught with his band of warriors (Orlando Bloom, Jonathan Rhys-Davies, both excellent, as before), and Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, respectively) returning the ring to the hellfire to bring the war to an end once and for all. The same themes of duty, friendship, and courage continue to abound here, and the characters really come to life here, more so than in previous installments, in my opinion. The CG work is absolutely breathtaking, especially the war elephant scene, which is so incredibly real. It is, like both its predecessors, remarkably well made in terms of production values, but this one really plays with the emotions of the viewer, at least more so than its predecessors.
In short, even if you weren't the biggest fan of the last two, this one might just surprise you. My one complaint: I saw it on opening night and didn't see one person dressed as Gandalf! What's the matter with you, LOTR orthodoxy? :) I kid, of course: the movie does drag a little at the end, but that is understandable, there's a lot to tie up. In short, this is one you've got to see.",1082073600,2,1971,4.53932584269663
7274865,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"(...)George Lucas was, I believe, in grade school when JRR Tolkien published these books.  When one is portraying the human struggles of good vs evil, one often uses fairly universal themes and types of characters--perhaps you didn't notice this in high school english.  How fortunate Mr. Lucas did.  As for your, ahem, critique of the special effects, I guess I haven't seen a whole lot of your superior work in theaters lately.  In closing, Peter Jackson has said that they decided to create Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth, which I believe they have.  If you have problem with basic content, the multiple endings, and length, perhaps it is just as well that you haven't read the books--they'd go over your head.",1081987200,4,715,4.87603305785124

This movie was non-stop action, suspense and thrills from start to finish...a must see for all LOTR followers and non-followers alike.
If there was a down-side, this is not a movie that you can view without first having seen the previous two.  There are so many subplots and storylines happening at the same time that you would be lost.  However, all three are well worth the time and effort so go for it.

I saw it twice, didn't really like it 100% the first time and truly disliked it the second time. The CG and other special effects are too obvious, and at times I felt like the story was just meandering all over the place.

7274869,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"What can one say about this film?  It is the climax to the greatest movie trilogy in the history of the genre-I think it is fair to say that the original Star Wars films have been eclipsed.  The 3 LOTR films have an adult storyline taken from one of the true classics of 20th - century literature, great acting (a travesty that only one actor, Ian McKellen, was nominated for an Oscar for 'Fellowship of the Ring'), and SFX by WETA that are second to none.

The final installment of the series takes things to new heights in nearly every area.  The stupendous Battle of Pelennor Fields is simply awe inspiring; hordes of orcs, cave trolls, catapults, a squadron of oliphaunts, flying dragons, and a gigantic calvary charge...incredible!  One scene that really sticks with me is the death of Theoden, followed by Eowen's confrontation with the Witch King; it takes two good hacks of her sword to behead the Witch King's dragon, then she kills the Wraith with a blow to the face (aided by Pippin's timely stab in the leg).  Yes, this is only a PART of the grand scheme of things in this magnificent film.

Taken in total, it is obvious that the Motion Picture Academy saw fit to reward Peter Jackson and cohorts for ALL THREE films in giving 11 Oscars to this movie.  Some have disagreed with this approach; I feel it is richly deserved.  When one watches the films on DVD, it seems that they should all be seen continously...they really are one long film.  The only real limiting factor is time.

The one stellar thing about LOTR is through all the technical wizardry, the films never lose their basic humanity.  It is really the story of love and friendship, evil and greed, the lust for power and the love of freedom that make these three films the great accomplishments they truly are.  Now we wait and see if Jackson can pull off another miracle: remaking a true all time classic, animator Willis O'Brien's 'King Kong'.  Let's hope he does better than that DeLaurentiis debacle...",1081900800,5,1983,4.628571428571429
7274870,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"(...)Seeing the Return of the King without having also seen Fellowship and Towers may leave one a little bewildered at first, but my sister saw the movie without the experience of the previous two and was simply awe-struck with this movie.  Funny thing is, she doesn't even like sci-fi/fantasy movies.  She seemed to get into it just fine.
Honestly, to get the full enjoyment and fulfilment that this film offers, you really have to see all three.  I don't see why anyone would want to view any of the latter parts of a trilogy without first seeing the first, but I still think R.o.t. K can stand alone.
If you like a nice epic that draws you into itself, suspends all reality and disbelief, with pupil-dilating special effects that either push you deeper into your seat, or abruptly snatch you out of it, this is your film.  What this movie does, like no other film I've ever seen, is it brings the viewer into the lives of seven different characters, and provides that viewer with a familiarity and an understanding of those characters that is unprecedented.  The characters become very real, and you cycle through a full range of empathetic emotions for them.  I've seen masterpiece films in which one can gain this experience with one or two characters, but never on this scale.  Seeing the previous films just enhances the experience.
Lord of the Rings, both the book and the movie trilogy are a great experience that I highly recommend to anyone. After all, this is a modern classic--both the book and the movie.",1081900800,2,1518,4.70566037735849

When they made the first film ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", I seemed to like it more than ""The Two Towers"".  Now, ""The return of the king"" is very inspiring to anyone who is a ""big action-fantasy movie fan"".  I liked how they made the movie 3 hours and 20 minutes because it was a long time to express everything in the movie.  I thought it was good enough to see four times!
Also, when they spaced out all of the battle sequances and go to amazing camera angles that almost reminded me of ""The Matrix"" trilogy.  This was the best movie I have ever seen.  This film can also compare to another great film of 2003 ""The Matrix Revolutions"".
When I watched the first 10 minutes, it was great and got right to the point in explaining what they missed in ""The Fellowship of the ring"" of the odd fantisised creature ""Gollum"".

7274873,1,B00Z9YZRVE,"Review for Return of the King
First off, this movie made no sense. They don't bother to introduce anyone or tell us what is going on. Maybe this would have made more sense if I had seen the first two movies. But come on. You can't use that as an excuse, movies should stand ALONE ON THEIR OWN MERITS, and on its own, this movie doesn't make any sense and nothing is explained. I mean, who is going to take the time to watch all three of these movies? That's like 11 hours!
I seem to be the only one to notice this, but this movie is a total rip-off of Star Wars. I mean, come on, really. It makes the movie almost embarrassing to watch. The Ring is just like The Force. Sauron is the Emperor, and Saruman (good guy gone bad) is Darth Vader. Brash, cocky Aragon was modelled on Han Solo, and Frodo is Luke Skywalker. They replaced the lightsabers with real swords, big deal. And that Gollum guy is an Ewok if I ever saw one. Think about it, he leads the Hobbitts around like the Ewok leads Leia around. Coincidence? *Snort of derision* Yeah right. Mount Doom is the Death Star. The Orcs are like the Stormtroopers. And in the biggest chutzpah rip-off of all, Gandalf is clearly based on the popular character Yoda. I mean really. Did these people think they were going to get away with it? I could go on and on with the evidence, but I think what I've presenting is conclusive enough. So for originality this movie gets a big zero. Even the locations remind me of Star Wars.
Thirdly, the casting is inept. Elijah Wood, the kid from the Macaulay Culkin movie ""The Good Son"" as Frodo? Har har. Mikey from the Goonies as Sam? Viggo Mortensen from GI Jane fame as the dashing warrior? I mean, whoa, the casting crew must have been on acid or something.
Fourth, the much-talked about special effects. It's difficult for me to watch a movie with such special effects. In all the sweeping shots of castles and fortresses, you can see how badly pixelated everything is - I mean come on. I was making better CG models on my Amiga and Apple II in the 1980s then this stuff, and it's more than 20 years later? Haven't we learned anything in this time? Apparently not. And that guy dressed up in the Gollum suit... wow, just wow. During one shot I saw the zipper on it, and I buried my face in my hands and almost wept.
Fifth, the dialogue is about as cheesy as you can get. ""We must fight, to save the world!"" Uh, okay there Thor. *Insert golf clap here* There are also many cliches taken from the Dragonlance book series here. It's shameful, simply shameful.
So, all in all, I must give this movie 1 star out of 5 possible.",1081900800,22,2612,4.310975609756097

Everything, in my opinion excelled with vibrancy and depth. Music - Haunting, Cinematography - Breathtaking, Visual Effects - WHAT visual effects?! A wonderful scene particularly is seeing those massive olephonts dominating the screen, I really did feel quite insignificant! But I could have never guessed by a first glance that it had all come out of a computer!

I would have loved to see Elijah Wood (Frodo) and Sean Astin (Samwise) recieve Oscar nominations for their acting. I thought their performances were the best display of companionship and passion I've ever seen. But I'll assure you I was truly thrilled seeing ""Return of the King"" win Best Picture - more than deserving!!
I love the ending (or endingS)! To comment again on someone's opinion, I certainly didn't leave the cinema feeling totally happy! In fact the bittersweetness of the finale was what I found so emotional, I was both thrilled and heartbroken at the same time!
I would just like to wrap up in saying, this film CHANGED me! Something in that film gripped me so deeply and I don't think I will ever be so humbly touched again! Now, for a film to do that to someone, must be pretty special indeed!
I hope this review is helpful and encouraging! ""Lord of the Rings"" is a true cinematic masterpiece and will go down in history as the greatest trilogy ever, from magestic beginning, to brilliant end!",1081468800,6,2093,4.882022471910112

You do not even have to see the first two films in order to love this movie, but it helps.  There were zero disappointments and I was completely satisfied with the end result.  Everyone should see these films.  They are the Star Wars of our time.  It however isn't my favorite movie, of the year, but it is definately the second.

Frodo is the weekest part of the whole trilogy. Wether Frodo is falling down, falling asleep or just starring off into space with those big puppy dog's, everybody seem's to get the drop on him. Then ditching Sam over a few little bread crumbs that bug-eyes planted on him--lets trust Smeagul-ya-he's my friend. I was hoping Sam would lop both there heads off and make good with the ring. Totaly could have done without Liv Tyler's character. Aragon should have fallen for the  blonde who went into battle and took out the serpent. She had guts & good looks.

Here are the things I was displeased with.
1) (MOST IMPORTANTLY) Where the heck was Saruman/Sharky?! He is my favorite freaking character and they left him out!!! I'm aware that they are going to put him in the extended version dvd... but still. I was really mad.
2) The left out the entire part at the end where Saruman captures the shire and cuts all of the trees down. So mad!
3) This wasn't as big a deal to me as my first two rants were... but still; I didn't like the whole happy ending. I don't know about anyone else who read the book, but I was kind of depressed after reading it.
(...) If you want to be totally amazed, read the book and don't be a lazy-bum.(...) <3

7274888,4,B00Z9YZRVE,"This is the latest DVD trend that annoys me: They will release this version now and then, later, release the ""Platinum Extended Edition"" which is likely the one you'll really want.
This version is what you saw in the theater along with some nice extras, however if you wait for the ""Platinum Extended Edition"" you'll get extra footage integrated into the movie and even more extras.  I made the mistake of buying the first release of The Fellowship of the Ring only to rebuy it in the form of the Platinum Extended Edition later and won't make that same mistake again.
Let my mistake serve as a warning to others: consider waiting for the better edition coming out later!

7274890,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I'll say it right off the bat: ""The Lord Of The Rings"" is simply the greatest, most astounding movie trilogy of all time. I'll say this ever quicker: ""The Return Of The King"" is the greatest film in history. There are simply no words to describe my love for this film. It goes beyond an obsession, beyond a craze and the same can be said for most of the world. The recipient of 11 Oscars in February 2004, the film deserved every single one, and then some. The film has also grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, becoming only the second film in history to do so. ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"" are both classic movies which opened up J.R.R. Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth to the world. Director Peter Jackson had the vision and put it on screen to create two of the most astounding action fantasy epics in history. However, both pale in comparison to the masterpiece of gargantuan proportions that is The Return Of The King.
Although Saruman (Christoper Lee) has been defeated, the battle is not quite over. The quest for Middle Earth is just beginning, in fact. In a last attempt to annihilate the race of men, Sauron assembles his army of Orcs to launch a devastating attack on the capital of Gondor, Minas Tirith. The capital is currently being ruled by the rather insane Denethor (John Noble), father of Faramir and the now-dead Boromir. He has no hope in the capital and will not assemble an army in preparation for an attack. As all this is going on, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join forces with Theoden (Bernard Hill) as they prepare for battle at Minas Tirith. Despite assembling an army of Rohan residents to fight, they are significantly outnumbered by Sauron's forces. Their solution to go deep into a cursed mountain proves inspirational. The discovery of the ghosts in their sea of lush green makes for most impressive viewing and this is fully realised upon their attack at Minas Tirith. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) is also astounding once again in his role, and lifts the spirits of millions.
Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum continue their trek to Mount Doom in their unwavering quest to destroy the One Ring. Along the way the ring threatens to destroy their plans, as does Gollum whose evil side is more prominent than before. Despite other astounding moments in the film, we must not forget that this is the movie's main story. Their arrival at the great staircase is phenomenal, and made even more memorable by the enormous green bolt shooting through the sky. The broken relationship between Frodo and Sam due to Gollum's interference is heartbreaking and proves the film still sticking to the emotional side of the book. The spider scenes are at times scary, but always entertaining. The journey to Mount Doom is the most anticipated ever seen on film surely, and the final scenes within the mountain are just complete overload. You're on the edge of your seat and nothing is going to tear you away.
The best moments arrive with the battle scenes at Minas Tirith. The massive boulders that are launched from each side are some of the most impressive weapons ever seen, and the arrival of Nazgul's is absolutely breathtaking. The way they soar over the mountains is just awe-inspiring and the screeching they make truly was deafening in the cinema. The sheer amount of Orcs preparing to rip the place to the ground is amazing. There must be hundreds of thousands covering miles and miles of land - it makes the battle at Helm's Deep in The Two Towers look like a child's ice cream fight. The lighting of the beacons, the enormous battering ram that breaks through doors and the arrival of the Rohan army to kill off the Orcs is fascinating, pulse-racing viewing. However, nothing can prepare the viewer for the arrival of the eight-story mammoth elephants that mark their arrival with horns as they swish their trunks/tusks through the air, destroying hundreds in their sweeps.
What is most astounding about these moments are way in which Jackson constantly cuts from eye-popping bonanza action to emotional and intimate moments. For instance, as the camera rides on the back of a boulder tearing through the sky and crushing a hundred Orcs, we then witness Pippin (Billy Boyd) holding his ears and crying to the heavens as manic fear surround him, before he kills his first Orc. Or with Merry (Domanic Monaghan) riding with Eowyn (Miranda Otto) on their horse and the defeat of Sauron. It's heavy and beautiful, as is the scenes between Arwen (Liv Tyler) and her father Elrond (Hugo Weaving). Then more breathtaking, open-air battles, followed by textured and poignant moments of friendship, hope and the will to survive. This is what makes the film so spectacular. Obviously, it would be nothing without the stunning special effects, but its the relation between the emotion and action that makes it all so brilliant.
OVERALL GRADE: 10/10
As the final fifteen minutes of The Return Of The King roll on you're left with a feeling of amazement, of astounding satisfaction in the fact that you know this is the greatest film of all time. Your nerves balance on the edge of oblivion, waiting to see if Frodo drops the ring into the fire or not. I give many thanks to Peter Jackson for displaying his vision and creativity.

7274891,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"In order to give credit to this movie, I honestly believe the trilogy has to be reviewed as a whole.  This is not and Indiana Jones type trilogy with three individual stories.  Without one, the other two fail.  Together, these movies make up the most outstanding, monumental and brilliant bit of moviemaking that we are ever likely to see in our lifetimes.  The fact that Tolkien's works are shear genius only makes it more difficult to translate them onto film.  And although it would be impossible for anyone to make the ""perfect movie"" from these books, Peter Jackson came as close as any human possibly could.  I'm definately looking forward to the Extended Edition DVD.

The benefit of buying this on DVD, of course, is that you can pause it if for some reason you get distracted or tired of watching it up to a certain point. I loved the movie so much that I bought the GameCube game soon after I saw the movie. I thought that the ending of the movie was okay, but it could have been done a little better.

7274894,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This series all the movies from beginning to end, the cast from begining to end, the special effects, art work, music were all Magnificent.  These movies in my opinion go down as one of the best or if not the best ever conceived and brought to the big screen.

(something I wish the new star wars movies would have done).  Frodo, Sam, Treebeard, the Uru-hai, Aragon, Gandolf all were memorable characters my compliments to the actors who played them and most of all my sincere thanks and gratitude to director Peter Jackson for bringing a series of movies into my life that I will never forget and always talk about to my children (when I have them) and to their children.

7274895,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Peter Jackson's final movie in the trilogy not only puts this series to rest in a grand way but propels it to classic status as well.  The return of the king is the best film of the series, and it not only ends this trilogy in a high note but also raises the bar in movie making forever in terms of story and emotion.",1080518400,5,317,3.953125
7274896,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"To the loyalists amongst us let me just say that while some liberties were taken with the original text, they were certainly not enough to keep anyone from enjoying this masterpiece of fantasy cinema.  What Peter Jackson his writing staff, producing staff and gloriously underrated and underappreciated cast have proven with this film is that good writing, excellent acting and wonderful pacing can take a film from being just another movie to a cinematic event. One filled with awe inspiring heroism, angst, loyalty, love, and a fierce sense of purpose. While at the same time making the events and emotions relatable bringing them back down to human scale so that we may examine them more closely.  The heroism, angst, loyalty, love and a sense of purpose isn't without its price and the price is high.  It's paid in lives and a sense of longing that permeates the whole film.
Yes there are a lot of special effects in the film, some that are so grand and wondrous that one is won't to describe them but words fail.  There are effects that level the viewer leaving them gasping for breath at the beauty and brilliance of them, while others are nearly invisible because of their subtlety.  But if the trilogy has taught us anything it is that effects don't make a film, they may enhance it but the driving force behind any film of merit is the direction, the performances and the story being told.
Return of the King deals with good and evil on a grand scale, while bringing it down to a level of the everyday.  Frodo and Sam are still on their journey to Mount Doom, being led by the horribly conflicted Smeagol/Gollum, who has been so tortured by the Ring and want of the Ring that basically all he is at this point is an addict. Who is willing to do whatever he has to do in order to get the Ring back into his possession even leading Frodo and Sam to Shelobe's lair. You see the disease of addiction being played out in one of the most brilliant performances of the film.
Merry and Pippin are given a much larger role to play in the final battle then in the previous two films. They are separated due to Pippin insatiable curiosity.  Both are faced with choices that test who they are, while demonstrating the strength of their bond.
Gandolf's metal is also tested once he arrives in the kingdom of Gondor.  He must lead the people into battle until Aragorn can get there and take on his role as King.
Aragorn finally comes to terms with who he was always meant to be, who he is.  He is the King of Men, who must lead his people against the forces of Mordor and take the battle for Middle Earth to the Black Gates in order to buy time for Fordo and Sam to reach the fires in the heart of Mount Doom.
His uncertainty is palpable as he takes on the heavy mantel being given to him.  And yet he does so, with a grace that speaks to his nobility and his sense of what is right.  At the Black Gates he is tested one last time and find that he is his own man, that the blood that runs through his veins does not dictate what he will do. He is his own man.  He is the King of the people of the West.",1080345600,3,3097,4.329879101899827

7274898,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The Return of the King comes as a truly epic moment in cinema, an amazing film it ends (sadly) the Lord of the Rings trilogy in a breathtaking manner. Jackson does a fantastic job with his shooting here, magnificent camera angles, lighting, sound, it all falls into place here. And as for the actors, everyone is at the top of their game, even Elijah Wood (though that is debateable). Aragorn at the end IS the king of Gondor, and Viggo Mortensen fits right in there, making the role seem real. The final scene is possibly the best in the movie, the grey havens. People in my theater actually left crying from the ending of the movie, that's how well it was done. This movie will undoubtedly end up in countless people's collections, and remain as one of the greatest ever made, (sweeping the oscars)",1080172800,2,800,4.5625
7274899,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This movie is amazing. Some critics have said it lacked the emotion of the first film and focused mainly on combat and less on characters.  But I think when the Rohirim charge over the field of orcs it shows something of Theoden's character, especially in his speech before they charge.  And Aragorn's ""For Frodo"" charge, while not in the book, shows his total belief and faith in the path laid before him and his trust in Frodo to truly end the conflict.  Then there are the interactions between Sam, Frodo and Gollum.  The trio deserves Academy awards for their amazing performances.  The emotional state of Denethor is not difficult to see either.  Gandalf is perfectly portrayed as the stern yet wise wizard who leads the people of middle earth on, even when his advice seems unwise.  He truly encompasses Tolkien's views on how the world changed from WWI and WWII and how the nature of war itself changed because of them.  Gimli and Legolas' characters are the only ones that got a little undercut.  While he and Legolas are representative characters and do not have as much growth in the story as the rest do, it is sad that Gimli becomes the comic relief dwarf and Legolas the one who lets the audience know exactly what they are fighting (orcs!) and then performs some over the top fighting sequence.  It would be nice to see a little more of their growth too, but then again, we already have five characters undergoing major changes, to add two more might just bog the whole thing down.  The additional scenes with Eowyn are great and provide more growth for a character that was underdone in the books, if you ask me.  Arwen again feels like she's there solely because they paid so much for Liv that they had to use her, but still Jackson keeps her character relevant and well portrayed.  Elrond too gets more screen time in the movie than he has in the book, but he does take the place of several other characters and it would've been a shame not to see more of Hugo Weaving.  Merry and Pippen are also well done if not perfectly.  You get a real sense of just how big everything must seem to these little people.  Overall, character growth is well done.
As for the adaptation of the original material, a movie and a book are two very different forms of media, and the two cannot and should not be compared. The books are great, and so are the movies, but they are apples and oranges. The omissions of certain scenes from the theatrical release will not doubt make their way into the extended version, such as the confrontation of Saruman, the use of the Palantir by Denethor, and possibly even the small romance between Faramir and Eowyn. Peter Jackson has confirmed the first one, and the last one seems hinted at since Faramir and Eowyn are standing next to each other at the end. The second is not necessary, but it would be nice to see.  I would love to see the Orc Chieften's death scene, although it would require much work on Peter Jackson's part to portray, as it is not a major scene in the book.  Over all, the additions to the extended version should be plenty and will make the movie even more satisfying for all.
The special effects are obviously amazing and the battle scenes leave nothing to the imagination.  The Rohirim's attack on the Haradim is one of the best scenes in the movie, as is the siege of Minas Tirith.  Shelob looks perfectly creepy and people in the theater cringed at the sight of her.
As for the numerous endings, it would've been unheard of it Peter Jackson had ended it with the destruction of the ring, and simply had a voice over tell us what happened to the characters. It would've been equally unfulfilling of they ended with Aragorn becoming king. To show that Frodo could not live the rest of his life in the shire was important to his character, and needed to be presented in contrast to Sam, who was totally content to live out his days fully involved in Hobbiton. And if the movie did not end with Sam saying the final lines of the book, people would be up in arms. Peter Jackson had a difficult task with the ending of Return of the King because it wasn't just an ending to a movie; it was an ending to all three films.  And he pulls it off with amazing skill, something to rival even the greatest of filmmakers.  This can be said for all three films, a true treasure that will hopefully be revered as such for many years to come.

7274902,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This final installment of Lord of the Rings is, at last, the conclusion to an epic saga that has been unspooling on screen only recently, but long since concluded in Tolkien's novels. Very quickly, those who have read the book are separated from those who have not - while the other movies were distinctly different enough to provide some surprises, the end is a foregone conclusion. It's all a matter of how sensitively Peter Jackson handles the emotions, the actors, and the plot.
Fortunately, Jackson grew as a director. Where the second film felt uneven, the movement between several different groups (Frodo and Sam, Pippin and Gandalf, Merry and Eowyn) is flawless. The film never loses its rhythm until the end, and by then we all need a breather.
My biggest concern about the film was the final battle. It only makes sense that Sauron would use the various troop types (flying forces, elite troops, heavy cavalry) to the fullest. Jackson does not disappoint. Trolls in battle armor wade into the fray as mumakils stomp on horses like ants. Wraiths on rothes tear up and terrify the unprepared human forces. And of course, orcs are everywhere; squealing, chortling, cackling, hacking, and dying.
Jackson strikes the perfect balance between emotional pathos on screen and his desire to craft a war film. That desire was a little too strong in the second film, where orcs ran up to a fortification with polearms in hand. Polearms exist almost exclusively to 1) stop other polearms and 2) stop the unstoppable charge of cavalry. To use them in an assault on a castle is just plain silly. Jackson used them for effect (""Lookit all those polearms!"") but stopped just short of having the orcs start uselessly whacking away at the stones.
In Return of the King, the orcs are led by a weirdly deformed pig-like orc named Gorbag who provides some actual leadership. He orders his orcs to set their pikes for a charge when the Rohirrim cavalry arrives. He orders his archers to fire at the right times. And he's such a bad ass, when a huge stone is catapulted towards him, he merely steps a few feet aside and spits at the projectile. Given all that attention, you would think Gorbag would get a cool fight scene like Lurtz did. No such luck.
In fact, there are a few things that seem to be missing from the film. Certainly, the Mouth of Sauron is nowhere to be found (he'll be on the extended version, of course). There are also some unfulfilled promises, such as when the Witch King promises to ""crush the White Wizard."" He doesn't even go near Gandalf.
But those are minor quibbles that are noticeable only after seeing the film in the theater six times. There are so many great moments that it's hard to keep track of them all: From Aragorn transforming into a leader before our very eyes, to Legolas taking down a mumakil single-handedly, from a song by Pippin as Faramir charges to his doom, to the last charge of Denethor off the cliff of Isengard. There is joy, there is sorrow, and there are inevitably plenty of tears - on screen and in the audience.
The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the Star Wars of our time. It is a parable about the importance of friendship in a world gone mad, a world that will always have a parallel in geopolitical events. It stands as a testament to Jackon's and Tolkien's vision that the film works on so many levels, as an action film, as an allegory, as a romance, as a fairy tale, as a political commentary, and as a popcorn flick.",1079913600,,3467,4.611650485436893
7274903,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the best movie of 2003 and is quite possible the best movie ever. It is on the top of the charts in almost every category except for most nominated, and it's not too far from the top. This movie is much more deserving of eleven oscars and one billion dollars plus at the box office than the piece of trash sleeper that's supposed to potray the Titanic disaster. The Return of the King leads in all of the categories that potray a movie: action (and I mean action!), tradgedy, drama, love, visual effects, directing and producing, and story. The action, as I'm sure you've realized, is my favorite part. The movie has plenty of sequences. Legolas's bow and arrow rocks, as does Gimli's axe and Aragorn's sword. Gandalf, Merry, and Pippin also get to participate this time as well. There's also plenty of humor in the action. Let's not forget Gimli's comment on Legolas's big kill (""It still only counts as one!"") and the confrontation between Theoden's niece and the Nazghul king (""You fool, don't you realize that no man can defeat me?""""Well, then, it's a good thing I'm a woman!""). The love in this movie is fantastic. Aragorn and Arwen are constantly thinking about each other like true lovers (and no adultery and betrayal like other movies (Titanic...Cough, cough))
and the love (like the kind between true friends) that the hobbits show to each other is moving and powerful. This movie is definetly one of the best movies ever. Actually, I think it IS the best movie ever!",1079827200,2,1526,4.655555555555556

Theatrical Version Review
Although the cinematic achievement of the theatrical version of `The Lord of
the Rings: The Return of the King' may be considered unparalleled in the genre
of epic fantasy, there are problems with the film.  Arguably, there are four
major areas where I feel there could be improvements.
1.) The Smeagol flashback opening runs a bit too long, and could be trimmed to
one half of its length.  The Edoras Victory Party could also be cut in half.
Streamlining the first twenty minutes of the film would leave room for the
Death of Saruman, a necessity considering the evil wizard's stature in the
first two films.
2.) Denethor's ownership of a palantir and his obsession with using this seeing
stone would explain his madness more fully.  A short scene revealing this fact
once again develops Denethor's character better than the film's simplistic use
of grief alone.
3.) The absence of the Orc Chieftain Quasimodo's death scene as well as the
face-off between Gandalf and the Lord of the Nazgul are both glaring
omissions.  The over-expanded Arwen story could have been trimmed to include
these two necessary story closures that would have greatly improved the film.
4.) The House of Healing scene is compulsory for two reasons.  The hospital
sequence establishes the blossoming romance between Eowyn and Faramir as well
as revealing the healing powers of Aragorn.  The omission of this scene is yet another
poetic jewel left out of the Lord of the Rings' cinematic crown.
Again, my affection for this trilogy soars even though I feel the critique
above illuminates the editorial errors in bringing the great epic to the silver
screen. I eagerly await the Extended Edition that surely includes some of these
scenes.",1079654400,23,1757,4.979522184300341
7274906,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Doing a ""blue collar"" review of this movie is at best difficult.  I sat for the three and a half hours in a theater with two hundred plus other people totally engulfed by this production.  Though not faithful to the books I read for the first time in Vietnam, the story flowed beautifully with no breaks (those places that inevitably occur in most movies where you look around and see what other people are doing) in the story line. Peter Jackson and Company have brought to the screen a visually stunning, action packed, and, in places, a heart wrenching version of this third installment of Tolkien's masterpiece.  The setting selections coupled with the special effects make this one of the great visual epics of all time.  I was especially taken with the performance of Sean Astin (Sam) during the scenes with Frodo after reaching Shelob's lair.  I actually heard the lady beside me crying during the scene where Sam thinks Frodo is dead and again on the side of Mount Doom.  Though overlooked for major awards, Mr. Astin proved, at least to this reviewer, that he is a fine actor.  The battle scene before the gates of Gondor was the most visually exciting segment of the movie with Orlando Bloom's (Legolas) battle with the giant elephant capping it.  Elijah Wood (Frodo), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), and Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf) turned in their normal solid supurb performances begun in the first and second movies.  While the part of Arwen was played beautifully by Liv Tyler, I didn't care for insertion of a love story that was only hinted at in the books.  Mr. Jackson was able, though, to make the story flow naturally as if it was part of the original story.  I was also a little bewildered by the number of endings the film seemed to have.  For the last five minutes of screen time I, not being an individual who stays for the on screen credits, felt like a jack-in-the-box.  Movies, in my mind, should be like an classical music overture and give you one good loud ending after which the director puts down his wand and bows.  This grand movie seems to be like we who have been watching the trilogy for over two years now.  It and we didn't want it to end.  Probably the best thing about this movie and it's two prevously released installments is that young and old will be watching on the edge of their seats and enjoying this future classic long after I'm history.  If you haven't seen the movie you've missed one of the great ""feel-good"" experiences in cinematic history.",1079654400,14,2490,4.635535307517085
7274907,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I love the Lord of the Rings movies, and LOTR: The Return of the King is quite a satisfying conclusion to the Peter Jackson trilogy.
It's better than the previous two films, not in terms of story, as all three simply begin, continue, and end the story of the 'ring', but rather in terms of quality and expression.  You can tell that the filmmakers are really in their element by the time they work on this film, and all I could do was sit back and be filled with awe time and time again at the music, the imagery, the grandeur, the epic nature of the battles, the incredible effects, and the emotion.
I see the whole trilogy as one movie now, but each part has a certain style different persons may prefer; 'Fellowship' was graceful and beautifully slow, capturing the feel of the shire, the argonath, moria and rivendell perfectly, showing off incredible music with each scene, a really well done introduction to middleearth, 'Towers' was a huge suprise to many with all its action and heart pumping visuals, taking the best action shots of the first film to the next level, like the 'balrog's fall' and the 'attack on isengard by the ents'; it created many new fans who thought middleearth was 'quite beautiful' but still 'quite boring', by really increasing the tempo of the story.  And gollum...oh, my, GOODNESS.  He was already so compelling (yet repulsive) in the first film...but NO ONE could have expected the endearing (chilling) performance he gave in the Two Towers.
This third film, 'King', is my favorite though. I like it the most because it combined the graceful imagery and music of the first film, with the action and heartracing tempo of the second, and then added delicious layers of emotion again and again until the whole film just transcended genre and became a masterwork of cinematic expression that i have rarely ever experienced.  I felt like there was so much to take in that was enjoyable, that I would just have to see it again and again in order to fully get the most out of it - it was that amazing to me.  When it ends you realise you just can't hate something that has this much love of story and filmmaking written all over it.  You may not cry at how the story ends, but the experience stays with you long after it over, and should you see it again, you tear ducts may not react the same way.
I highly recommend the filmed trilogy of the Lord of the Rings to everyone, especially those who are tired of the same old same old kinds of movies all the time (really - many more films lack exceptionality than not), or those just looking for something new or different, or unexpected.  This is a movie for the thinker who likes a slice of adventure, beauty, and music with his/her story. An epic adventure with beauty and heart, that isn't from the Lucas/Spielberg era...who could have expected it?",1079654400,3,2828,4.566074950690335
7274908,3,B00Z9YZRVE,"There were a number of terrific scenes, and the cinematography and special effects were probably the best I've ever seen.  I do not think it was too long, or had too many endings -- in fact I look forward to the extended edition.  The Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli story was especially well adapted, and Gollum was a delight, but after an astonishingly good start (the first two movies), I feel that Jackson slipped a little on this one.  I have three complaints:
1 - Overlooking Minas Tirith (the big Gondor city) is an absurd man-made cliff with an opening in the middle of the wall.  All that was missing was a sign saying ""leap here"".  Was it really neccessary to create this monstrosity so that the steward could jump rather than just burn to death?
2 - Some scenes were so melodramatic (including orchestra swells so obvious it seemed like parody) that I found myself laughing during what were supposed to be tender moments.  Sam and Frodo were the primary culprits.  Entirely too much time was spent repeating the same extreme close-ups of those two doing their best ""love and concern"" faces.
3 - There was also a dull, unneccessary (and to those who read the books, confusing) side story about Arwen becoming mortal.

A good movie, but not a great one.  I expect that the scenes added in the extended edition will bump it up to 4 stars for me, but it can't compare to Fellowship, or even Two Towers.",1079654400,,1399,4.608870967741935

There are some really tense moments in this film especially when Frodo, Sam, and Smeagle battle over the ring.  Some of the band of characters fall in this film but I do not want to give it away.  Will Aragon become King?  Perhaps if he can get the help of some ghost knights.

If you are unfamiliar with the books then some of the suspense may overwhelm you, especially one of the climatic scenes between Sam, Frodo and Smeagle and the Ring.
Some of the band fall and you wonder when things get bleak if Aragon will indeed return as king.  I don't want to give it a way but some ghosts play a big part in how things turn out.",1079568000,3,517,3.9047619047619047

7274912,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"The masterpiece of our time has arrived on DVD.

Each installment of Peter Jackson's masterful interpretation of the classic novel by J.R.R. Tolkien have been incredible, weaving an intricate and beautiful story into images that are completely mesmerizing, allowing the viewer the chance to experience Tolkien as never before.  Yet, as good as the first two installments, the massive and robust ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", and ""The Two Towers"" are, ""Return of the King"" is that much better.
This third and concluding chapter in the ""Ring"" series draws together the quest that was begun with the fellowship of nine in the original film. As Mordor prepares to launch war on Middle-Earth, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), under the mis-direction of Gollum are nearing their destination, Mt. Doom, where the one-ring can finally be destroyed. Gollum, whose mind has long been corrupted by the ring, has devised a plan to kill Frodo and Sam so that he can re-claim the ring for himself.

Elsewhere, Aragorn (Viggo Mortinsen), Theodin (Bernard Hill), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhyes-Davies) and the powerful wizard Gandalf (the incredible Ian McKellan), are preparing for the ensuing battle that is about to be unleashed on the kingly city, Gandor. In a desperate effort to raise an army, this small alliance of man, elf, dwarf and wizard set out to recruit every able-bodied man to fight in a war that will decide forever the fate of Middle Earth.
The massive scope of this film is, at times, unbelievable, in that it is far more colossal than any depiction of war ever seen on screen. The battle sequences, which contain armies in the tens of thousands, are filmed with a level of complexity that put audiences on the battlefield with the characters on screen. At the same time, the film balances the intense war sequences with the tender and intimate relationships that defined the fellowship from the very beginning.
As Sam and Frodo, in the final third of the film, are about to enter Mt. Doom, Frodo collapses, and, in a performance worthy of the Oscars, Sam consoles his friend, and then lifts him onto his shoulders to help Frodo complete the journey they set out on together. The moment is tender, in spite of the intense situation they find themselves in. It is that balance of humanity and action that makes the movie more than a fantasy story, but rather a true epic in every sense of the word.
Everything, from the ground-breaking special effects, to the costumes, weapons, sets and set-pieces are so well thought-out, so completely and meticulously detailed, that Middle Earth truly feels like a real place; like something lifted out of history instead of simply a fictional world created for a movie. The beautiful city of Gondor is breath-taking: set in the side of a mountain, it looks like one of the great cities found in Italy during the hightimes of the Roman empire. In contrast, the horrific realm of Mordor oozes with the abysmal darkness of an evil that is both ancient and powerful.

If there is going to be a set of films that will define as this time-periods classics, then the entire ""Lord of the Rings"" series could very well be the ones, with ""The Return of the King"" standing as a pinnacle in the achievements of one director's vision to bring to life one of the most beloved, most read novels of all time.  Already, this film has been recognized by every major film association, sweeping awards in both the Golden Globes (winning the best picture amongst others) as well as the highest achievement in film, the coveted best picture Academy Award (in addition to a phenomenal 10 other awards including best director (Peter Jackson)).
Critics from around the world have celebrated this film, and almost universally it is agreed that this is one of the great ones, and as a film, even amongst the other installments of this trilogy, it stands alone. Aptly named ""The Return of the King"", its majesty is untouchable...and it truly is the crowning masterpiece of the ""Ring"" series, and, undeniably, one of the greatest films of our time.

7274913,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"WOW!! A true visual delight. It had me glued to my seat (even during the intermission ;-) thinking about what I have seen).
Peter Jackson said that he'll make this movie so great that this movie would be the reason to make the previous two parts. He is absolutely right!!
I don't remember seeing any movie which made such an impact on me (after The Matrix). The movie is a combination of special effects, emotional sequences, great acting and all the ingredients of an Epic.
Even if you have read the book, you won't mind the slight bends peter jackson has made in the story.
There were some instances where I feel the special effects team would have done more work. Initally when Eovyn is seen at Rohan's fort from a helicopter shot, the smoke seems to go inside hut's chimney. Also in the end when Frodo went inside the Mountain of Doom, he seemed to float on the way.
There would be many more small glitches but I just couldn't get my senses off the movie to notice them.
I would definately advice you to run to the movie theatre near you!!!",1079568000,2,1044,4.414507772020725

Aragorn, Legolas,Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gimli, Boromir, all the actors gave so much to this film or movies.  Even Gollum pulled you into his pain and suffering.  I hope everyone sees these movies and I believe everyone can relate to it some way or another.  I did not come out of the theater with a dry eye.

7274916,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Peter Jackson has definitely achieved more than a classic or a cult for fans. This film is perhaps one of the most precious jewels in the history of cinema.
All of the performances delivered, the special effects were dazzling and used when and exactly how it was necessary for keeping the film as more than a mere visual show. A true and powerful drama and fantasy adventure.
The Battle of Pelennor Fields is something Hollywood is going to try (and notice I said TRY) to reproduce for years. And I doubt there can be many faithful adaptations to the spirit of a mythology like this one.
On the other hand, the only thing that bothers me about this DVD is the lack of ""Extended Edition Preview"" unlike previous Lord of the Rings Theatrical Editions (the announcement with the features in the official page omitted this one). I know I certainly will prefer the Extended Edition (like the first two films) better, and personally recommend these editions over the Theatrical ones.
If you cannot wait until November (or June as some rumors claim over there), or if you are not that of a Lord of the Rings fan and prefer the rough cut that is a Theatrical version compared to the Extended one, then buy this one.
But I still advice people to wait for the Extended Edition which will include scenes like Saurman's fate after a final confrontation with Gandalf, The Houses of Healing where Eowyn's love for Aragorn comes to closure after meeting Faramir, more Pelennor Fields, more Minas Morgul with Sam and Frodo, probably the Mouth of Sauron character, Aragorn confronting Sauron through the Palantir, more of the ""Path of the Death"" with Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas, Gandalf's confrontation woth the Witch-King, and much more ( - over 40 minutes of additional material! - )",1079308800,27,1768,4.762214983713355

I was happy and surpried that The Return Of the King sweeped the Oscars winning 11 Oscars, but I feel bad that they didn't put the Oscar logo + Best Picture Of The Year on the DVD Front Cover (usually movie distributors put the logo to tell that their movie won so and so oscars). Ah well I am not going to buy the theatrical version as I am going for the extended one. I hope they put the oscar logo on that 1. It is sad that the story has ended and youll get up and say, man why did it end so soon.
Then youll remember that well they cant take out a LOTR movie year can they. Anyway there is talk in Hollywood that Peter Jackson is gonna make THE HOBBIT, prequel to LOTR. It is expected in 2007-2008. So atleast there we will something from LOTR to wait anxiously for.",1079308800,,944,4.108108108108108
7274918,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Now, first of all, I have to respond to the people who compare these films to Star Wars or even The Matrix (""were they released as books 50 years ago, they would be praised as the greatest trilogy of all time""). This is ridiculous. The Lord of the Rings, and Tolkien's work in general, has a lot more depth to it than the Matrix and Star Wars ever can dream of. And George Lucas himself said he was influenced by Tolkien, so what are you all talking about?
As for the Academy Awards: well, Return of the King is simply better than the rest and it fully deserves every single Award it received. That's it. Accept it or not.
Then the movie itself: it's all about the siege of Gondor and Frodo's final journey into Mordor. The  two main themes of the film are death, despair and the consequences of war.
I don't want to spoil the movie, but it has quite a few surprises. The end is bittersweet and true to the book.
What else can you say? It's three hours long, but very well paced. The effects are superb as usual, but they come second to the story. The acting is brilliant, every actor totally transforms into his character.
The sound is amazing and Howard Shore pulls off the best of his three scores.

This is what happens when I get lost in the hype.  I had thought this final movie in the trilogy will not only justifiably end the series, but end it in a way to put shame into any other movie who dare end theirs and put a tear in my eyes and change my life and shed my unwanted weight and pay for my car insurance...but it didn't.
Sad really, since it's not the failing of the movie but the unattainble expectation of some of its viewers (like me).  I just can't help but get stuck on all the bad parts of the movie.  Sure, the tears in my eyes welled up and dribbled down my cheek onto my jacket in various parts of the movie.  If I also thought rationally, I can also see a masterfully created finale.  But whenever I start to think back on the film and begin to like the film, I then remember the light house of sauron.
I have read online (especially onering.net) and am looking forward to the extended cut of the film with many extra footages (Saruman, House of Healing, Sam and Frodo getting mixed in with the orc army in Mordor, ect.).  One rumor puts the extra footage time at over an hour (here I go getting hyped up), and that certainly will fill in some of the lesser part of the movie.

7274922,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"At the end of The Two Towers, Gandalf says the battle of Helms Deep is over, the battle of Middle-earth is about to begin. In a sense, that does sum up The Return of the King. Helms Deep was really just an opening skirmish. And the real battle is happen right now between the men, elves and the orcs.
Saruon comes to believe that men still have courage to encounter his force and men are not weak as his supposed. He will not risk the people of middle-earth united again. He fears the King of Gondor return. Therefore Saruon brings all his army to Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor. He wishes to stick down the city to the ground in order to make the middle-earth fall in shadow again. The world is in dangerous.
Gandalf rides to Minas Tirith for alert to the Kingdom of Gondor. The leadership of Gondor is in the hand of the stewards who are supposed to be the caretakers for the throne. However Denethor, the stewards, don't wish to bow to Aragorn. Gandalf raise the beacons of Minas Tirith, Rohan answered. Although Gondor didn't come to the aid before, the riders of Rohan are summoned to the aid of Gondor. And in the Pelennor Fields they fought for the freedom of middle-earth.
On an external level we have the massive war, and on an internal level we have 2 little hobbits, Frodo and Sam. They are on their hands and knees literally crawling up a mountain. It is the relationship between two nice characters. It is the heart of the movie. They face the adventure with trust, friendship, confidence and mission. Gollum wish to sow discord the fellowship between them. And you can imagine the pain and suffer in their journey.
The movie brings a message: At what cost will good win? People always believe justice is always happen around the world. The evil cannot win the good. But they did not think everything have its price. Although at last the ring destroyed and Aragorn become the King again. There is great lost as well. Theoden, the King of Rohan dead in the battle. Frodo always lost his finger. There is also lost many solders and warriors of Gondor and Rohan. The unexpected is Gandalf and Frodo go to Undying land with the Elves at last. Many people come to believe that it is a fate of the ring-bearers.
The position of the Lord of the Rings can beyond Star Wars in my point of view. It considers all situations which we will face. Like the forbidden love between Aragorn and Arwen, the friendship between Fordo and Sam, the battle between human and evil, the different between 2 wizards Gandalf and Saruman.
None of us can imagine from The Fellowship of the Ring, the fellowship will be broken into 3 parts. Fordo and Sam continues their journey to Mount Doom. Gandalf and Aragorn leads the mankind resist the evils. Pippen and Merry becomes a warrior. They find themselves with an army that going into battle with.
The whole movie runs 200 minutes. And there is even no time for you to think. I have waited this firm since The Two Towers. There has been almost 1 year. And it is very glad that if finally in theater. There are many huge battle senses and emotional stories. The only regret is the director Peter Jackson cut many sense in order to make the firm run only around 3 hours. Many of my friends and allies always purpose this problem.
This movie also makes us to understand that man should be united in our common interest. We all live in the same planet. We all breathe the same air. We should not separate by only selfish or our own meaningless will. Of course Saruon would not appear in the real world, but the spirit always exists. Men always own guilty in their mind. They are weak to resist evil. They are scattered, divided, leaderless and unsatisfied. If we let this situation continue happen, men will fall in no time.
All we shall do is make our world peaceful and fortune. Let us make our dream V Utopia to come true. Let us make every child have their right to be educated. Let us make our world have resources to help the beggars. And let us always look down show some mercy to everybody.
One small step of us, there will be one great step for all mankind. Let us hope tomorrow the future of mankind will be brighter than everything.",1079049600,4,4178,4.469895287958115

I cannot forgive the return of the king.  Having read the books... several times, I know that there were three great moments in this story.

7274925,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Well, I decided to take my time for this review, and after seeing the movie several times, I have to say that is really, really a stunning movie, the characters are developed to the end of them, they are wonderful, everyone did an amazing job and all the characters shown something new and eye-catching in them, the Pippin and Gandalf scenes where really astonishing, the Frodo and San scenes?? just wow!!! Eowyn and Theoden last scene is just totally amazing!!!, and everyone else?? just wow. The Cinematography is just mind blowing!!!, every scene and landscape was so well take care of that is just.... to much, the scene with the beacons, and the one where Gandalf arrives at Minas Tirith was some of the most remarkable images I have ever seen in cinema. The battles and the special effects where really, really good, there is no way we can tell the ones that are special effects from the real thing, the scene where Gandalf is taking the doors of Minas Tirith??, it was so real!!! the place seemed so alive!!! just wow, the music?? is so intense and outstanding!!, nothing could get the atmosphere better than this music.
This is one of those stories that you can just watch and watch and watch and never get bored, and well, I can't wait for the EE!!!! :), be well and take care",1079049600,4,1285,4.567099567099567
7274926,5,B00Z9YZRVE,I am so glad Peter Jackson did these movies in a triolgy. So few movies these days reach the the level of an epic. The Return of the King is a perfect end to an already amazing experience.  Jackson truely brought the social commentary that Toliken wrote about to life!!  Truely a must have movie for all time.,1079049600,,309,4.310344827586207

7274928,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"This is undoubtedly the best triology series ever produced by Hollywood.  Great special effects, beautiful music, colorful characters, fantasy, magic - something for everyone.  What a wonderful treat for the public.  This is a series I will watch over and over again and can hardly wait till my granddaughter is old enough to enjoy watching the movies with her!",1078876800,,361,5.084745762711864
7274929,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I loved this movie.  Absolutely loved it.  It was a supurb work of cinema, the artistry and special effects were breathtaking, and there was very very little to complain about acting-wise.
But as an adaptation?  There are some massively questionable moments, such as linking Arwen's fate *directly* to the ring (as opposed to having her fate be the same as everyone else's, should Sauron get the Ring back).  Such as Elrond bringing Aragorn the sword (in the books, Aragorn had it the entire time, I'm pretty sure).  Such as Merry (and I think Eowyn) at the Black Gate with Aragorn to challenge Sauron in that last battle scene when the Ring was being cast into Mt. Doom.
I can't say the *movie* is crap because they did these things, but I can say that the adaptation leaves me with many questions.  However, the movie in and of itself is a masterpiece, and one that is worth any amount of money to go see and own.",1078876800,,915,4.515151515151516
7274930,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"* This review might be somewhat biased because I am a Lord of the Rings fanatic *
Never has any film evoked some much emotion in me. Return of the King should not be praised solely for it's incredible visual and sound effects or it's meticulous attention to detail, but for the depiction of it's characters and the emotional intensity it delivers. Peter Jackson is a remarkable director for wrapping up such a magnificant epic in that manner. Also, Howard Shore, the composer behind the beautiful music, should be praised for the score. The music transports the listener and perfectly interwines with the scenes down to the last string.
Return of the King left me tear-soaked and stunned and I could not get out of my seat. The credits began to roll and I refused to believe it was over - there wouldn't be another one next Decemeber. The range of Sean Astin's performance as Samwise is extroadinary and Elijah Wood's Frodo is the perfect picture of corrupted innocence. Also, Billy Boyd's performance (and his singing, which broguht me to tears) as Pippin and Miranda Otto's performance as Eowyn both stood out. Their characters had not been an integral part of the story thus far, but in Return of the King, they shine.
*Spoliers - Do not read if you have not seen the film*
Most tear-jerking moments: When Pippin sings for Denethor mirroring Farmir's ride to Osgiliath and Denethor's eating (symbolizing the spilling of blood), when Sam delivers his speech about the Shire in springtime, when Sam carries Frodo up the slope of Mt. Doom, when Aragorn gives his speech at the Black Gate, when the Ring is destroyed and Merry cheers for Frodo, when Frodo wakes in the Houses of Healing to see Gandalf for the first time since Moria, when the entire company at Minas Tirith bow to the Hobbits, when Frodo leaves to get onto the ship bound for the West, and finally, when Sam says the last line of the film which happens to be the last line in the book.
There has been some complaint as to the film having several endings. (ie: fading to black and then continuing)In response to that complaint: This is how Tolkien wrote it and it was the best way for Peter Jackson to wrap up each individual story line.
I have tried my best to convey my feelings about Return of the King and I could go on for pages, but you have to see the first two films, understand Tolkien's world, and baisically... have eyes to see that this is the greatest film made to date.",1078790400,5,2448,4.578587699316628
7274931,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"No other movie series ever made can compare to the magnificence of the LOTR series. These three movies combined make up the most action packed, adventurous, and dramatic movie epic you'll ever experience. What I find most interesting is how they're based around olden day Anglo-Saxon/Norse mythology. Well anyways, I highly recommend these movies, especially ""Return of the King,"" to anyone who loves the old fashion battle scenes with castles, trebuchets, archers, and knights.",1078790400,3,478,5.472972972972973
7274932,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"I could easily use-up 1000 words and still have more to say; however, my review isn't so much of the movie, but what you hear during the movie...the music! Have you purchased the CD's yet? Listen to the gut-wrenching sounds of the violins and you will fall apart at the seams! It is both mournful and most beautiful! No other music could have been done for this trilogy of movies! You feel the pain, the agony, the thrill of the entire movie through the music! (I cannot not say anything about the movie...these fine characters will live forever in our memories)",1078704000,,562,4.574257425742574
7274933,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Although this is the final film in a trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's novels, it is not necessary to see the other two films inorder to appreciate The King Returns...but that would certainly help. Each correctly indicates the scope and depth of Tolkien's imagination...and the nature and range of skills required of Peter Jackson when bringing the trilogy to the screen. Fortunately, modern technologies and complementary resources now enable filmmakers to create immensely complicated combinations of imagery and special effects which were previously not possible. These are essential to the visual impact of the terrain on and over which various battles occur. However, as director Jackson correctly suggests, ""In addition to these huge battles, you have these intimate stories, the emotional story, and that's where most of the power of The Return of the King really lies."" For me, that is the key to this film's critical and commercial success (e.g. nominated for and recipient of eleven Academy Awards): an epic narrative in human (or human-like) terms. This film invites at least some similarities with Tolstoy's War and Peace as well as with The Wizard of Oz and the Star Wars trilogy.
Here's the basic situation. Sauron's forces have laid siege to Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, and are determined to eliminate the human race. Quite literally, the fate of Middle-earth will be determined by (a) an effective coalition of forces and (b) the emergence of a king around whom men, hobbits, elves, dwarves, etc. rally to achieve ultimate victory. Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) does all he can to buy time to prepare for the inevitable all-out attack, joined by Rohan's King Theoden (Bernard Hill). And meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood), an exhausted but determined hobbit, slowly works his perilous way through enemy lands to cast the One Ring into the fires of Mount Doom. He is accompanied by Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin). Finally, the decisive battle begins and then....
The fact that this film and its director received an Academy Award but none of its actors did indicates how important teamwork must have been while bringing it to the screen. The results are truly impressive visually, of course, but more needs to be said about the film's affirmation of spiritual values amidst all the stunning special effects. I was especially touched by the hobbits who, in less capable hands than Jackson's, could have been presented as pets to be adored rather than as warriors (albeit diminutive ones) to be admired. McKellen gives the film necessary gravitas as an active, indeed engaged leader who understands better than anyone else does what must be done and how best to do it. From the beginning of the film, Viggo Mortensen is wholly credible as Aragorn.
A few quibbles. For example, I could have done with fewer close-up shots of Frodo's face. Also, the pace dragged unnecessarily at times, perhaps because of the great difficulty of coordinating and sustaining at least four major story lines at the same time. Also, I wish there had been somewhat more development of the characters played by Liv Tyler (Arwen) and Cate Blanchett(Galadriel). As I said, quibbles. On balance, this is a magnificent epic and in all respects a brilliant conclusion to the trilogy of films which, I hope, will encourage many of those who see one or more of them to read Tolkien's novels.",1078704000,,3380,5.059139784946237
7274934,5,B00Z9YZRVE,"Middle earth may be a dangerous place, but it's a good one. Seeing such bravery, loyalty, friendship and pure goodness is heartwarming. It is the heart and soul qualities beyond effects, acting, and scenery that were all superior that made this one of the finest films ever made. Not one performance was off. Passion truly is a great testimony of Christ, but this movie tells more about His message.",1078531200,5,399,4.797101449275362
