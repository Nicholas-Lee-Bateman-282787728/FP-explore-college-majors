5189999,5,B008Y1YKS0,"This movie is one of those classic black and white movies that used to run on TV constantly when I was I kid. For Heaven's Sake made a definite impression on me, but I never could remember the actual title. I just came across it on cable and immediately decided to purchase it so that I could share it with family. I plan on giving a copy to friends, as well. They are too young to have ever seen this before, and I'm sure it will make the same wonderful impression on them that it made on me all those years ago!

Great film for families to enjoy together!",1402617600,2,557,4.110091743119266
5190000,3,B008Y1YKS0,"The story is of a childless couple in The Theater, and the efforts of angels to get them to realize they need a child.  You immediately meet their unconceived little girl, who picked them as her parents, and the rest of the movie is one funny/sad attempt to get the couple to realize they are missing something very important.",1391299200,4,326,4.52542372881356

5190002,4,B008Y1YKS0,"Clifton Webb & Edmund Gwenn are delights as two angels helping a little girl to be born. Webb has a terrible hair style, but he does have some funny moments. Joan Bennett is quite wonderful. It's a nice comedy, not hilarious and Webb has been funnier, but still it's a keeper.",1379376000,3,276,4.431372549019608
5190003,5,B008Y1YKS0,"Have always loved this movie and had it on VHS. But wanted to get it on DVD hoping it'll stay with me longer. It's a fun movie and has so many well known players. Joan Bennett, Bob Cummings, Edmund Gwen, Joan Blondell, and my favorite - Clifton Webb. Oh yeah, and don't want forget Harry Von Zell of ""Burns and Allen"" and child stars Gigi Perreau and Tommy Retigg from ""Lassie"". Can't beat all that. Also being a fantasy, one of my favorite genres, made it even more appealing.

It's basically about two unborn children, Gigi and Tommy, waiting for the big moment to be conceived with angels, Edmund and Clifton, coming to earth as humans to help their dream come true. Clifton gets a little carried away with enjoying being human and the fun starts.

I would recommend this to anyone who loves old movies, fantasy, and a movie to watch with the family.",1365206400,15,853,4.496774193548387
5190004,4,B008Y1YKS0,"Clifton Webb and Edmund Gwen play angels on a special mission; To get this ""Broadway"" couple intrested in family life.

8532324,3,B008Y1YKS0,"For those of you who enjoy this movie, here is a bit of trivia about the movie. The special effects to make the angels appear and disappear were done by hand with each frame colored in white so as the frame rolls by the actor appears or disappears. How do I known this? Because my father was one of the artists who did the frame by frame coloring. He worked at the studio in the art department for short stint in the early 50's. He is now almost 90 but still recalls fond memories of working on this movie. He especially liked Gigi. He said she was a very sweet girl.",1465344000,2,567,4.117117117117117

8532330,4,B008Y1YKS0,"I recommend this movie for good entertainment.  I ordered this DVD as I wanted to watch the full movie.  My wife was watching this movie on a movie channel, and I joined her in the middle of the film.  Since I enjoyed what I was watching, I tried to record the movie, in its entirety.  It didn't work.  Since any movie channel seldom shows this movie, I decided to order the DVD.  I'm glad I did.  The premise of the movie is that two middle aged male angels come to visit the unborn daughter of a theatrical couple whose marriage is not the greatest.  Their goal to help improve the relationship of the couple, so the child can be born.  Besides this very interesting plot for a 1950 movie, the movie has an all-star cast.  Edmund Gwenn and Clifton Webb play the angels.  Robert (Bob) Cummings and Joan Bennett play the theatrical couple.  Also, Joan Blondell, in a minor role, plays the friend of the Bob Cummings character.  She also becomes a friend of the Clifton Webb angel character (see the front cover), after he changes himself to human form in his plan to make the theatrical couple closer.  However, he becomes 'intoxicated' with being human (which is, in itself, very humorous).  The complications of an angel becoming human is another interesting aspect of the movie.  Anyway, I would to consider the movie a minor classic.  The film is very enjoyable to watch because it is a older movie (made, in my mind, during the golden age of movie making), it has great ensemble cast, and it has a uniquely conceived plot.  The only problem with the DVD is that there are no scene selection mode and no special features (which would have been nice).  Again, I enjoyed it, and I am glad to have it in my DVD collection.",1414108800,9,1723,4.5
