1616160,5,B00005K9OL,Film maker John Walker has produced an exceptionally beautiful and suprisingly informative documentary on individuals for whom faerie is a vital part of their lives. His interviews of people who have had encounters with faerie are insightful and revealing and his capturing of the enchanted landscape is at times breathtaking. Included in  the program is a rare interview with internationally acclaimed faery artist Brian Froud. This tape is a must for any lover of faerie.,1001635200,13,473,5.306666666666667
1616181,4,B00005K9OL,"this is a documentary about the fairy faith, or the belief in fairies. the narrator takes the viewer around various places in canada and the uk, talking to people who believe and looking at locations of relevance. though it isn't the most well done documentary i've seen it is pretty good and it's the only documentary i've seen done on fairies. the film doesn't try to convince the audience of anything nor disprove anything. it attempts to achieve an unbiased perspective, taking in the opinions of those who believe and those who don't (mostly the believers though as we're looking at the belief, not a criticism of the belief). i think it successfully documents the fairy faith and does a good job of taking seriously subject matter which the majority of western society sees as nothing more than fantasy and idle past time.

i would recommend this to everyone interested in fairies, and anyone with an open mind, because though it isn't asking for the viewer's belief it is asking for the viewer's acceptance of the belief. interesting study.",1209859200,,1047,4.849162011173185
1616182,3,B00005K9OL,"Some of us who have managed to live among you unnoticed might not appreciate your looking too closely at what we are doing. So, perhaps you shouldn't watch this film. Not if that means you are going to come looking for us.

There are enough people tramping all over and dropping their garbage without adding even more!

We who are even here in pixels might well go so far as to suggest that you simply leave us alone. (Although we are not adverse to some milk and honey or a biscuit left out for us now and then.)

Assuming we were real. Which we are not. Stay focused upon your own lives and do not block our paths. If you happen to see us take care by which eye.

1616184,2,B00005K9OL,"I purchased this along with ""Fairy Tale-A True Story"" assuming it would give a little more insight into the ""Fairy"" genre.  The truth of it is that ""The Fairy Faith"" goes on-and-on with repetitous stories and anecdotes to the point where I pulled the disc at halfway point and have felt no desire to finish.  If does have any redeeming value past this point, it would have been wise to give the viewer SOME hope.  I find the subject matter very intrigueing and the ""Fairy Tale"" film was delightful and beautifully done, but this documentary is neither.",1167868800,5,552,4.670103092783505
1616185,4,B00005K9OL,"As far as I know, this is the only documentary on the fairy/faery mythology. As other reviewers have pointed out, it doesn't leave the viewer convinced that fairies are real, or bring forth any evidence trying to state that case at all. But I don't think that that's the point of this film.

As one of the interviewees remarks, ""I'm an expert on the study of this belief system and its mythology, that doesn't necassarily mean that I personally subscribe to it."" That's really the point of view of this film. The director speaks to several people in Scotland and Canada about their experiences and the stories they've heard.

The main idea here is that if fairies do exist, they don't exist in the typical human realm where we can prove their existence and photograph them. They also don't exist entirely in the human imagination. Fairies occupy that mythical realm in between, whatever and whereever that is.

For me this film offered a nice look into the history of fairy mythology and some beautiful scenic shots of Scotland. Seeing the land and shrubbery really helped show why the idea of fairies would come into existence.",1166745600,3,1128,4.774358974358974
1616186,1,B00005K9OL,"As a huge fan of anthing faery and especially Brian Froud, I was very excited to find this one of a kind dvd about the exisitense of faeries. However I was quite dissapointed with the content or should i say lack of content. The people interviewed convinced me of nothing more than their need for a visit to a shrink! Not one of the people (with the exception of Brian Froud), revealled any convincing accounts of their contact with the faeries. One bit in particular caused both my partner and I to laugh out loud! A man who was taught by his shamin Grandmother to speak to the faeries, leads the camera crew to a beautiful stream and points behind a tree and says there is a faery behind it. He proceeds to make contact with this faery and says he is too shy to come out. The camera then focuses on this tree and nothing happens. Meanwhile the guy makes some weird hand gestures (supposedly communicating with the faeries) and makes the announcement that more have come out to find out what is going on. Further through the film we are taken to Canada where two teenage boys who appear to be very slow or under the influence of drugs, swear they saw a little man standing on a cliff whilst at the beach. I bet they did!

But really, It was a very dissapointing film. If I didn't already beleive in faeries from reading numerouse texts on folklore and celtic mythology, this film would certainly cause me to remain a skeptic.",1148860800,17,1426,4.422053231939164
1616187,5,B00005K9OL,"For anyone enchanted by the ancient myths of fairy lore, your collection is not complete without this wonderful documentary by John Walker, ""The Fairy Faith"". Total running time: 77 minutes.
He takes the viewer on a magical journey through England, Scotland and Cape Breton, interviewing locals and listening to their stories about the ""little people"". Many of these people's beliefs are downright questionable, and I often found myself laughing and raising an eyebrow at what some of them had to say, but I did sometimes catch myself wondering if these mysterious creatures really are just legend or if they truly do exist? I for one find it hard to believe the latter as I am more of a logistic thinker but as I look back at my childhood, I wonder if some of the things I saw and experienced as a small girl were simply a figment of my imagination or if I was seeing it all with more clarity than I ever will again because I was not yet corrupted by life as an adult - living, in the rational world, to believe that there's reasoning behind every unexplainable, supernatural occurrence. Perhaps as we grow older we build a shield around ourselves, refusing to accept things we can no longer see with our own two eyes? I'm certainly not convinced that there are fairies dwelling among us but this documentary at least makes you ponder these things...

The cinematography is absolutely stunning, and the drawings they show amidst gorgeous, traditional Celtic music are beautiful to behold and listen to, magnifying the already breathtaking landscapes. But what I enjoyed most about this DVD was the interview with artist Brian Froud, who mostly talks about his dark, mischievous fairies, and how he became enthralled with them. And yes, he does believe they're fact, not fiction.
I also found it sad how many four to five-thousand year old trees - or ""fairy forts"" as believed by some - were cut down to build a new highway. It reminds me of how they built a highway near stonehedge and how that ruined the sacred, mystical beauty of the place.

I still question my faith in these strange, elusive creatures but if there's one thing I've learned from this well-executed documentary, it would be to not interfere with a fairy if you were to ever encounter one as they are not all sweet. Nor are they forgiving!",1138924800,5,2309,4.727047146401985
1616188,5,B00005K9OL,"Filmmaker John Walker has done all of us a big favor, believers and non-believers alike, in presenting us with this wonderfully charming and informative documentary on the 'Kingdom of Fairy.'

John's journey of discovery begins in Nova Scotia, Canada, a place not too unfamiliar to me having spent several summer vacations with my maternal Grandparents and extended family in and around the Isle of Newfoundland. While in Nova Scotia he takes part in a discussion with a classroom of local first graders on the topic of the elusive nature of the fairy phenomenon and the difficulty adults have in seeing them, a problem not as prevalent in children.

Soon John is off to England, Ireland, Scotland and Cape Breton in search of the 'wee folk,' documenting a wonderous array of on-camera interviews, numerous firsthand accounts of fairy encounters and a wealth of information all filmed against the breathtaking beauty of the Emerald Isle. It even includes a brief interview with the famous and reclusive fairy artist Brian Froud.

Absolutely enchanting! Do you believe in fairies? I'm not afraid to admit it, I DO!",1128816000,16,1113,5.0710382513661205

1616190,5,B00005K9OL,"The Fairy Faith is a delightful documentary about the wee ones, with wonderful interviews with many people who have seen fairies and elves in Ireland, Scotland, the Isle of Skye, and Canada. I especially loved the way the classic folk tales about fairies were interspersed with people telling their very own stories about first-hand observations, and the footage of the knolls and woods and streams where fairies are so often seen. The Fairy Faith really takes off toward the end of the film, where the real-life witnesses describe increasingly hair-raising incidents with fairies and elves. Another high point of this film is the interview with artist Brian Froud, whose spectacular paintings and sculptures bring the faces and personalities of fairies out of hiding and into view.

Documentary film-maker John Walker describes becoming interested in fairies because of his grandmother's faith that they were real, and Walker's journey to meet with other believers is clearly intended to delve deeper into finding a better understanding for why some people have such faith in these little ones. I was impressed to see how many people in The Fairy Faith are such strong believers in fairies, and how their stories clearly indicate that there are some things we humans just barely comprehend.

Of all the documentaries I've seen in recent years, this is the one that I want to watch again and again. I love the gorgeous scenery, the fascinating tales, the captivating art work, and the spell-binding stories by those who have witnessed the fairies in real life... this is my favorite documentary!",1110672000,11,1595,5.130769230769231

1616203,4,B00005K9OL,"As far as I know, this is the only documentary film to examine the belief in faeries. It deserves credit on this basis alone, especially for those of us who have a fascination with this subject. Filmmaker John Walker interviews people throughout the British Isles and Cape Breton who share their beliefs, stories and experiences with these otherworldly creatures. The film is nicely photographed; along with scenes of faery mounds and mystical landscapes there are paintings by faery artist Brian Froud (who is also interviewed) along with Victorian paintings. One of the things that becomes evident is that, for believers, the world of faery is not something to be trifled with. There are several accounts of people who paid dearly for violating the privacy of these beings. Walker also follows the case of a folklorist's ultimately successful attempt to save a tree that is allegedly sacred to faeries. It was going to be cut down to make way for a road. It was ominously predicted that many accidents were sure to occur on this site. The Fairy Faith is unlikely to convince skeptics that faeries are real. At worst, this film is a fascinating study in a folklore that goes back many centuries. At best, it's a doorway into an intriguing world that co-exists with our own.",1056672000,117,1274,4.875576036866359
1616204,5,B00005K9OL,"I believe that every faery lover should own this film!!
I run a large faery believers club at my domain at faery-magic.com and encourage members to see this film, in fact, I believe in this movie so much, I have copies that members can borrow just to watch it!
It is the most beautiful and extensive film on faery folklore in existence. It is not a story or a fairytale, it is a series of interviews with faery believers around the world, including Brian Froud. There is also a running narrative of faery history and folklore by the film maker.
The history and stories of sightings will have you believing, wanting to believe or at the very least this film will make you think twice!
The whole idea of this film and how it is made is captivating. The scenes of Ireland and Scotland will leave you breathless and aching to visit. The Fairy Fortress will astound you, the fairy harpist will mesmerise you, the fairy flag will amaze you and there is so much more I cannot even mention it all. Fairy music has long been a great love of mine and I hung on every word the musicians told and every note they played.
I agree that this is the definitive film on faery folklore to be made to date. Own it, you will love it!

1616205,3,B00005K9OL,"The person who wrote the summary on the back of this DVD is obviously not familiar with any of Brian Froud's work, which is too bad because Froud is interviewed in the film! A fairy is not just a little person with wings and magical powers. That's only the conventional English description of a fairy. This movie has a lot of interesting interviews with locals in Scotland and Ireland but I wish it went deeper than just fairy mythology and folklore. It's not something I'd show to anyone who challenges your belief in fairies, since it's really only a series of interviews with locals, many of whom seem to be a bit daft. Still, I enjoyed it and if you're a fairy fanatic it would be a nice thing to have.",1050364800,7,706,4.396946564885496
1616206,3,B00005K9OL,"I bought this for the Brian Froud interview which was way too short! I enjoyed that one bit so much, and some of the others said great things too, the harpist was lovely. Some of the regular people telling stories were difficult to understand sometimes because of their accents, perhaps subtitles would have helped some. It is not as much of a documentary as I expected, just one interview following the other, I don't think we see the filmmaker at all. This would be amazing with some narration in between each speaker. At times I was bored with the rambling.",1020643200,9,560,4.61

Show it to your family and friends that scoff or mock your belief in fairies! You will have them thinking for sure, my family now look for faeries everywhere and some of the younger members have had sightings. This is a beautifully presented and detailed documentary on fairy folklore. The scenery is breathtaking, the interviews are interesting and at times haunting. Brian Froud is a highlight and his comments are heartfelt and believable. The fairy harpist was also fascinating, her music ethereal and mystical. These are very articulate and intelligent people discussing fairies in a very matter of fact and quite believable way. I urge you, if you have any doubt about the reality of the Faery Realm, then you  must see this DVD! Other highlights include an ancient fairy flag, a fairy fortress that sparkles like jewels and the fairy fiddler. Young and old viewers alike will enjoy The Fairy Faith.

The people interviewed are wonderful because they are fairy messengers with their stories that simply convey this thought, ""Consider this.  Fairies may exist.""  I have been blessed in leading spiritual tours to sacred sights around the world and it was PURE JOY to find that John Walker had been ""inspired"" to include many of these locations in his FAIRY FAITH. I want to thank John for sharing with the world the art of Brian Froud and the music of Elizabeth Jane Baldry.  This DVD is rich, rich, rich with inspiration.  Plus!  By buying this video you will get to see the incredible photograph taken at Gluskap's Cave.  My husband, who is a logical-thinking engineer watched the video with me and his comment to me was that the movie unveils a wonderful state of mind that's available to everyone.  He added that with the way things are in the world today, it was wonderful to dwell in the ""fairy"" space created by this DVD.",1016755200,11,1051,4.648648648648648
1616209,3,B00005K9OL,"This 77 minute documentary film is interesting.  It takes us on a tour through Ireland, Scotland, England and Cape Breton where we meet several people who share their experiences, visions, sightings and folk stories regarding fairies.  The people we meet are all charming and the scenery in these locations where faery lore is abundant is equally charming.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  It was like visiting with my Nana and Grandpa and hearing their tales of the faery realm.  I felt comforted by the honest matter-of-fact way they shared their feelings, ideas and experiences.  They weren't the least bit worried that they might seem far-fetched or unbelievable because in these countries there is healthy respect for the fey.  I enjoyed experiencing that openness and credibility.  I would tell anyone with an interest in faeries or the Celtic world or in magic to check this documentary out.  The reason I only give it three stars is that I didn't feel it was far-reaching enough. It really didn't knock me over in any way.  I would have been happy as can be to have come across it while channel surfing.  I would have certainly considered it a good program and worth the 77 minutes spent viewing it, though some of it was a bit on the dull side.  However, to order it and pay over...for it was too much.  It doesn't contain anything that any student of faery lore hasn't heard a hundred times.  It isn't a film I would watch again because I got the good of it from the one viewing and it's not profound enough or enlightening enough to warrant repeated viewings. If you can rent it or borrow it from a friend, by all means do so, but you can spend...more productively on other faery information or maybe start an account and save up to visit the Celtic countries personally where you can talk to the people and maybe experience the fey yourself.",1012521600,21,1853,4.661538461538462
