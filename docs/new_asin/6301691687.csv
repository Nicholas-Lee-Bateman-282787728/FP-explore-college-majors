346505,5,6301691687,"Why is this an R Rated movie? There are PG movies that are worse. My guess is the Republicans did not want kids to see what was going on. This movie was made keep in mind after George Bush won with his ""Dont Worry Be  Happy""type campaign and that famous ""Read My Lips"" speech.  Still there was no R Rated material on this movie.
I did think the movie  was an example of what goes on in corporate America. People who put all  many years manufacturing and suddenly get laid off even when the company is  making big bucks. It was sad seeing the Sherrif evict people right and  left.
This seemed to be a true description of what goes on in all types  of corporations.",952214400,2,663,4.214285714285714
346506,4,6301691687,"This very funny movie is also very unbalanced, not that it makes any attempt to be.  Moore is good at showing a few of the kooks and local sights that capture the spirit of a rotting town, but when he starts trying  to analyze why things went so sour, the film gets unfortunately naive.  Don't expect a movie about corporate ruthlessness, because the ruthlessness  is taken for granted.  What remains is really just a well-made portrait of  American small-towners at their most pitiable, which I must admit can be  pretty funny.",943660800,7,528,4.736263736263736
346507,5,6301691687,"Business is war and employees are an expendable aspect of it, as the 1989 film ROGER AND ME colorfully illustrates.  The documentary depicts General Motors' desertion of its Flint, MI, plant for the lower expenses and  cheaper wages of Mexico.  Riveting as the bolts that hold Cadillacs and  Buicks together, ROGER AND ME tracks journalist Michael Moore's attempts to  interview G.M. chair Roger Smith as ex-employees' attempts to build new  lives fail.  When it comes to the auto workers' union protection, ROGER AND  ME shows how the divide-and-conquer method works so well for General  Motors.  See ROGER AND ME!
A previous Amazon viewer review of ROGER AND  ME throws water on singer Pat Boone's recommendation of the Amway business.  Funny thing is, Amway offers its independent business owners what  employees wanted from G.M.: financial reward based on performance.  Another  irony: Amway Coporation also started in Michigan (Ada, MI), where it's been  for 40 years with no plans to skip town.",938476800,3,1000,5.15625

346511,3,6301691687,"This film has aged horribly and phenomenally. In order to expose the total inhumane and non-empathetic attitude of The boss of General Motors, Roger XXX, in 1988, when GM closed eleven factories in the USA, including the one in Flint, Michigan, and then opened eleven factories in Mexico and other foreign countries where labor was cheaper than in the USA, Michael Moore in this film appears today as defending a position that is bringing a whole vision of the world to ruin and chaos.

The working class in those days, up to the 1990s and at times even beyond, be it blue collar or white collar, had been educated if not tamed or broken-in and enslaved into the ideology that you had to get a job at 18 or 20 or even 22 and 24, and it was THE ONLY job youll have all lifelong and you will retire and even die in it. They then stopped learning, stopped improving, stopped being dynamic and athletic. They started getting fat, enjoying hours in front of TV and the satisfying though humdrum routine of a life that was a descent into hell.

Then you can imagine the drama if they lost their jobs. It is true the whole system was based on that planting these human plants in permanent places since human beings are perennials as is well known. And you can imagine what this ideology, this life style could produce as for distortion and inhumanity, like sexism and genderism, racism, nationalism, and so many other -isms including rebellion-ism, provocation-ism, jingo-ism (and dingo-ism), antisemitism, anti-intellectualism, etc.-ism. These human beings became chattel, human possessions of the business that exploited them, and pumped them dry of all resources.

Came the big recession of 2008-2009 and it luckily produced at first Obama-ism or Yes-You-Can-ism and after eight years of not coming out of the hole by going back to the good old days when you were born in any no-matter-which-industry to retire and die in it they moved to Trump-ism and Political-Hollywood-ism. And a millionaire braggart and his band of circus-and-menagerie millionaires were able to capture their attention with fake promises, like reopening the coal mines, which he could do but not with human miners, rather robotized coal-diggers, or reopen the car factories, but not with human blue collar workers like in Mexico where they are cheap but with robotized blue collar workers who are even cheaper than workers in Mexico.

What the Chinese are doing because they have to cope with the one child per family policy and replace three or four out-going low qualified workers by one highly qualified worker, that is to say shifting to highly automated and robotized, in one word or acronym AI-ed or should I say AI-zed, industry, administration, commerce etc., just as they shifted from a cash economy to the most virtualized monetary exchanges imaginable on earth, Trump and his acolytes are going to do it in order to even increase some more their profit margins.

The millionaire in the White House, and all his millionaire pals, know that but they think that in four years the nave blind monkeys who elected them will have forgotten the promises and hopefully there will be no inflation, for what it may matter, and hopefully the people will be so drunk with fury that they will start breaking everything and they will be dealt with the National Guard and real bullets. Because, and here Michael Moore shows it so well, cynicism is the first and main characteristic of the ruling class, capitalistic, elected or not, appointed or just social climbing.

Good morning the post-hang-over era and good afternoon the pre-delirium-tremens curse. We only have the leaders we deserve and I must say that the ideology birth-life-death-in-one-job only deserves leaders who are ruling over our toilet habits. And they will certainly not invent like in Brussels the common toilet, serve everyone and all people indifferently. Look at North Carolina.

346528,5,6301691687,"When ""Roger & Me"" came out in the late eighties, two Chicago film critics, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert of ""At the Movies,"" gave two enthusiastic thumbs up to this documentary and Michael Moore. Twenty five years later, Michael Moore is still at it with his documentaries ranging on issues such as gun control, Iraq war, elections, American health care and more. Michael Moore was born and raised in Flint, Michigan.

In the first documentary, you can see how Michael Moore's film style came about with a mixture of popular culture and realism. His documentary about Moore trying to meet and talk with Roger Smith, the head of General Motors, is more like a goose chase around Michigan, Chicago, and New York City. Roger Smith doesn't want to meet and talk with Michael Moore. Moore wants Smith to come to Flint.

For most of the documentary, Michael Moore meets the people including an African American sheriff whose job was to evict people from their homes even on Christmas Eve while Roger Smith is celebrating in downtown Detroit. There are plenty of comparisons between the haves and the have-nots. Michael Moore has become a champion of the have-nots with his documentaries.

Since ""Roger & Me,"" Michael Moore keeps making films. Twenty five years later, he provides a commentary about his film. I usually don't listen to commentaries since they distract me from viewing them. I hated the scene where a woman skins and kills a rabbit. As a rabbit lover, I just can't watch. It's the once scene where I want to fast forward.",1472428800,,1528,4.802281368821292

I was moved by the scenes of women with children having their belongings put into the street - including a Christmas tree and presents at one eviction site.  And all of this because Roger Smith decided he owed nothing to the workers who build GM into a mega-power...and wanted to maximize profits for a few at the expense of an entire city.  It pained me to watch the rich friends of Roger playing golf and sipping drinks at the country club while real people who had real jobs watched their entire lives unravel.  I will never forget something he said early on in the movie about how no other country on earth had ever had their working class experience such a great lifestyle.  And since GM was making billions, was it really necessary to make it a billion more by collapsing the future of everyone as if they made no contribution whatsoever?  And then, to add insult to injury, instead of using the available city, county, and state monies to create jobs in unarguably useful arenas such as shoring up infrastructure and replacing old lead pipes, they wasted it on an indoor theme park that cost millions and closed in six months.  And now, there is no one to pay the taxes needed to support even basic services.  I applaud you again, Mr. Moore.

346566,4,6301691687,"The irony of this film is if Roger Smith, then Chairman and CEO of General Motors, had agreed to Michael Moore's request in 1987 when Moore began production, there wouldn't be a film, or at least it wouldn't be half as interesting as it turned out. Moore simply wanted to interview Smith and take him on a day-tour of Flint, Michigian where he and the GM executives decided to close several of their car-manufacturing plants. Instead, Smith avoids the encounter, sending Moore on a kind of corporate wild-goose chase which ends up being both amusing and heart-wrenching.

The tragic under-story which is really at the heart of Moore's film is how Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan, essentially goes down the proverbial sewer once the plants began closing, because in all likelihood, the GM executives did not understand how entwined the plant was with the local economy. Unemployment went up, businesses closed, houses went into foreclosures, people were evicted from rentals, and crime escalated. At one point, Flint becomes the crime capital of the United States. Certainly, to blame all of Flint's problems on the plant closing may be unfair, but most of the people who made the decisions to close the plants, particularly Roger Smith, are unwilling to talk about it. Moore, as far as I can tell, never demanded Smith reopen the plant. He just wanted to talk about how the life of the town had changed as a result. But talking about it would mean having to look at it, and look at it is not what Smith wants to do, which is I think the whole point of the film.

At some point, Smith and the execs of GM become aware of Moore, his mic, his cameraman, and his crew, and hide from him at all costs, despite repeated requests for an interview. His employees as well as one of the lobbyists for the car industry, most of whom were not making 1% of Smith's yearly income, have to make excuses for him. The few who are willing to talk to Moore on camera rationalize that the decision to close the plants were in the best interests of the company, and that GM has absolutely no civic responsibility whatever, only the responsibility to make lots of money for their stockholders. Because Smith avoided Moore's microphone and camera, the irony itself makes interesting fair for a documentary film. The viewer's first thought is, what's he hiding? Of course, if Smith and his fellow executives made such a good decision by closing these plants right at the height of their profits, they should have nothing to hide and welcome the opportunity to explain their reasonings. Their avoidance of the conversation is quite telling.

""Roger and Me"" was Michael Moore's first documentary and became the prototype for all his later projects. Moore interjects all the elements that will become trademarks for his future films: Moore's voice-over, classic film footage, home-movie footage, interviews with local people, footage of local events, and the most interesting of them all, going to the large executive suites, trying to get interviews. He did the same thing in his most-recent film, ""Capitalism: A Love Story"" where he used a blow-horn in front of a New York financial firm yelling ""Give us back our money!"" In Roger & Me he simply tries to get to the 14th floor of the main GM Building. At the time, the security and company managers didn't realize this would be tame by ""Moore"" standards.

One of the more interesting developments is the numbers of celebrities and singers who come to Flint to try to inspire the town, everyone from the televangelist Robert Schuller, Pat Boone to then President Ronald Reagan, and Donnie and Marie Osmond make an appearance. Reagan suggests that the unemployed leave Flint and relocate to another state where there are more jobs. Sort of reminds me when certain politicians in the 1850's suggested African-American slaves relocate back to Africa. It's not only unrealistic, it's kind of insulting. Even Bob Eubanks, a native son and the MC for the Newlywed Game, visits Flint. Eubanks admits he knows nothing of their problems or their politics even though he was born there. The celebrities came and provided inspiration in very contrived live performances; unemployed persons got half off the regular ticket prices! The biggest irony is that aside from the discount, these celebrities who have made millions do nothing to actually help the town. The only attempt is an Autoland theme park, sort of like a Disneyland for cars, which bombs and closes after only six months.

People have criticized Moore and his films because they distort the facts. But I don't think Moore is presenting a Frontline-like documentary. He uses humor and irony to make his point. The funniest and most-telling scenes are often the interviews of those on the adversarial side which inadvertently end up making his case. My favorite scene is when he is interviewing a few upper-crust ladies at a golf course, most of whom haven't worked a real day in their lives. With their golf clubs and sun hats, they're saying that these out-of-work people need to get off their duffs and do something. All the while they're swinging away at golf balls in between riding around in golf carts. It's so funny that they don't even see how hypocritical they appear. Of course none of the four women offer to do anything for their fellow Flint townsfolk. It's sad that these women could probably make such a difference in these people lives, but all they do is play golf.

Certainly, Moore doesn't try to re-open the plant himself. But what he did was tell the story of Flint, Michigan, and I think that's Moore's main contribution. Again, his initial goal was simply to open a dialog. But of course, the minute people are willing to talk, who knows where it might lead?",1433808000,3,5761,4.831813576494428

346602,5,6301691687,"Roger & Me is a documentary narrated and directed by Michael Moore. It portrays the regional negative economic impact of General Motors CEO Roger Smith's summary action of closing many auto plants in Flint, Michigan, costing 30,000 people their jobs at the time and economically devastating the city.

Once the site of a thriving General Motors plant, Flint went quickly to seed when GM decided to close down and move out. As Moore pokes around what has been described by one magazine as ""the worst place to live in America"", he finds out how the local populace is coping with GM's betrayal of the American Dream. Among those visited are a family who is evicted just before Christmas, and an enterprising middle-aged woman who set up a thriving business slaughtering and skinning rabbits. Never feigning objectivity,he contrasts the impact of the shutdown on the average Joes and Janes with the diffident reaction of Flint's power elite. The latter's patronizing attitude towards the unemployed multitudes is succinctly captured in the scenes in which visiting celebrities Robert Schuller, Anita Bryant, Bobby Vinton and Pat Boone exhort the citizenry to grin and bear it. Even more out of sync is ""Miss Michigan"" Kaye Lani Rae Rafko, who in her morale-boosting speech to the disenfranchised GM employees begs them to pull for her in the upcoming Miss America pageant! The film's through line is Moore's futile effort to locate GM chairman Roger Smith, so that he can show Moore first-hand the utter devastation of Flint.

In this documentary,Michael Moore makes a good movie, and without inventing so many facts inspite of his obviously conceited and simple- minded attitude. Also,this is a this is a scathingly biting satire of Reagonomics that captures the zeitgeist of the late 1980's. This portrait of Reagan's America and the tarnish on the American dream comes down to a simple question: what is corporate America's responsibility to the country's citizens? That's a question no one at GM wants to answer.",1423612800,,2012,5.093939393939394

ROGER & ME: Michael Moore certainly doesn't look like a genius, or a threat. But beneath that slovenly, goofy guise lurks the cynical spirit of an avenging angel. Moore's genius lies in using that image: posing as a lisping simpleton too stupid to understand Orwellian Corporate Newspeak--or when to go away. If he were snide or snotty or confrontational, he'd lose us in a second. But he never attacks or accuses; he just baits and waits. Eventually, inevitably, his subjects hoist themselves by their own petards.

Moore's first feature-length documentary set the tone for several more to follow. The film is a masterpiece of bitter, savage, flamboyant irony: Moore merely casts a cold, quiet eye on actual events and lets them speak for themselves. They speak volumes; they speak loud and clear--and they speak heartbreakingly hilarious truth.",1422489600,,1105,4.903743315508021

It claims that Reagan visited Flint, Michigan in 1986 to show ""support"" for the workers by buying them a pizza and leaving them the bill but in reality Reagan visited there when he was running for office in 1980 and had pizza with workers for a different reason than showing ""sympathy with them for losing their job."" Instead he did it to ask for their support for him as he ran for President.

This is the biggest load of manure passed off as a documentary I've ever had the misfortune of watching. He tries to start out by introducing himself and how he grew up in the community of Flint. He talks about how if comes from a long line of GM workers, which is exactly what you want to do when you're about to try and make the audience care about them for an hour and a half. But then he says how much he hated it there and just had to get away only to come back when he washes out of his actual promised land... Really? Ok so he's both an elitist and a loser. Surprisingly accurate start in hind site.

Moore then goes on to interview recently laid off workers for the sole purpose of making GM CEO Roger Smith sound like the devil. He waltzes into corporate headquarters for the sole purpose of getting kicked out for the cameras. How do I know that you may ask? Because every news man in history would get kicked out if he tried to stroll into any area of any business with a live camera and no appointment. Let alone the CEO office of the largest company in the world. Ted Koppel couldn't walk into a Applebee's kitchen with a live camera and expect an interview. He is so obviously whoring for docu-drama time filler, it's absurd.

He pulls the same stunt with the same objective (and outcome) at a few exclusive restaurants throughout the film. Are we expected to believe he was actually told where the CEO of GM was lunching that day? Each time he tries it the restaurants are empty, which kind of betrays the fact he showed up between meals. I guess CEO's like to eat in empty restaurants. I think MM just expects us to be so entranced with his jarring edits that we don't notice.

By this point it's completely evident that he knows nothing about the global economy, business cycles, competition, efficiency, or anything else about capitalism. He doesn't interview economists, share holders, GM customers who liked other cars better, people who's jobs were saved when GM was made more competitive, or the Asian workers who were at that time working feverishly to make a better/cheaper product.

He interviews random yokels, rabbit killers, comedians who just happen to have lived in Flint in the past, and beauty pageant winners who happen to be driving through Flint (I wish I were joking). He makes everyone involved look bad in the process.

The fact that he never intended to talk to Roger Smith is made obvious by the inane questions he asks when he sees him. This movie was crap, please don't support him by buying it. Michael Moore made more money exploiting workers for this movie than Roger Smith ever did at GM. Roger Smith gave people a paycheck in exchange for work, the workers should never thought that it was a life long contract and should have had a plan for when/if they lost their job, just like the rest of us do.

There are people who actually want to push the national conversation about capitalism's unintended consequences and what we as a people should do to help retrain those who lose their job. Support those people, don't buy this movie.",1363996800,7,3281,4.485762144053601

I knew General Motors was big there, but I didn't realize until I saw this movie today that they essentially owned the whole city.

The Roger in the title is Roger Smith, at that time Chairman of GM. Michael Moore grew up in Flint. So when GM started closing plants and laying off thousands of auto workers, Michael decides he's going to interview Roger and ask him what he has to say to the laid-off workers of Flint. Amazingly, after three years of determined effort, he finally got to ask a few questions of Smith. Not that it did any good, of course.

Moore makes it clear that the only solution offered to the laid off workers was to move out of town, and probably out of state. Some got jobs at Taco Bell, but couldn't keep them in light of the demands for hurry, hurry, hurry. Michael interviews the manager of one of the Taco Bell restaurants.

He also talks to the sheriff's deputy in charge of housing evictions (just doing my job; somebody's got to do it), the laid off auto workers who were persuaded to take training to be a prison guard, as the crime rate in Flint skyrocketed. Talks to the country club set who insist that Flint is a lovely town, and generally documents the death of a city.

Now, I've never had much reason to like Flint, but it does seem rather horrible that the decision of GM to move a good bit of their manufacturing to Mexico was rather callous. He asks Miss Michigan what she would like to say to the laid-off workers, and she asks them to cross their fingers for HER, so she can be Miss America. They must have, because she won. To me, she also won the prize for unashamed selfishness.

This one is both important and entertaining--although I had to cover my eyes when the woman who sold rabbits killed and skinned one on screen. In ""Sicko,"" it was a guy sewing up a wound in his own knee because he could not afford a doctor visit. Moore does seem to find it necessary to try to gross us out at least once per film.",1336953600,,2118,4.338383838383838

The majority of the interviews are not humorous, make no real point, and have nothing to do with General Motors or Roger Smith. Moore spends more time with the rabbit lady and the eviction guy than he does with anyone else. And what purpose does showing a rabbit being killed serve this movie? That nauseating scene makes the scene in Fatal Attraction look tame. There are no solutions offered nor is there much in the way of analysis of the issues. In his own way, Moore is every bit as elitist as the figures that he caricatures throughout the movie.

346703,5,6301691687,"I saw Roger & Me (1989) in the theater when it came out. I had never seen anything like it before. A low budget documentary, but highly effective in what it presents. This Michael Moore documentary shows how corporate greed and downsizing at General Motors destroyed not only the town of Flint, Michigan, but also uprooted the lives of GM workers in Flint. Flint has never recovered to this day. It's a has-been, just like Detroit is a has-been that will never recover. Ever. It's the Former Motor City, and beyond the point of no return.

The best part of this documentary is the humor. Michael Moore knows how to present powerful material while injecting a dose of humor. I also enjoy watching certain celebrities put their foot in their mouth, especially Flint native and host of The Newlywed Game, Bob Eubanks. I also like the comments of Miss Michigan 1987 (who later went on to become Miss America).

Cold and calculating GM Chairman and CEO Roger Smith helped contribute to the destruction of GM in the 1980s with boneheaded, self-serving moves. He was a classic out-of-touch rich man who made $600.00 an hour in retirement, and that was about 20 years ago. Imagine what it would be now.

Nothing could be more effective than Moore's calm demeanor as he allows the company people to damn themselves in their own words, and the employees to show their real lives. First rate work; a classic.

The one important point not brought out in the film is why GM lost market share leading to layoffs; because they were unable to respond to consumer demand for smaller, higher quality cars being provided by Honda. Really unable to respond, over decades. We learn quite a lot about corporate America here, particularly that individuals who rise to CEO positions often do so based on seniority rather than talent. Here we see the spectacularly untalented Roger Smith, who could so easily have shown his employees that he understood their hardship but was too stupid to grasp why he should. This was the same Roger Smith who also tried to reform GM in the 1980's, with poor results because in that case he was too stupid to understand the hidebound culture of his own colleagues!

I have to say this movie has no point.  The movie is about Michale Moore trying to get the CEO of GM to somewhow get involved the lives of former employees and do some type of favor for them, WHY?  A corporation is not a charity, its a business, if corporations main stakeholders in all considerations were the employees than they would not exist and no one would benefit from their existence. Considiering GM built Flint and Michael Moore's whole upbringing is a result of that company's employment of his father and grandfather, I can't understand what he expects this business he derides as evil to do. Just because you have a job today does not mean your entitled to a job for life, I know this is totally against Union way of thinking, but thank god for America the majority of us are well aware of this.  Showing the human side of job loss is very sad, but isn't this America and a business has the right where and how to run their business to become profitable.  I loved the fact that because of the UAW's entitlement contracts GM is broke today, well at least they got a Michael Moore sympathizer running the show now.

346738,4,6301691687,"Roger & Me is a somewhat humorous documentary by Michael Moore about the devastating economic effects of Flint, Michigan when General Motors chairman Roger B. Smith chooses to close eleven car manufacturing plants there. The town is financially reeling from the 30,000 lost jobs and Flint slumps into a semi-depression.

Moore also attempts many, many times in this film to track Roger Smith (who is the Roger referred to in the title of the film) and interview him. Not surprisingly, Smith and his cronies have Moore all figured out and Moore is never able to catch Smith off-guard--except once, and I'll let that be a surprise to you because I don't want to give too many spoilers here!

As the film progresses, we meet the desperately poor people of Flint who are being evicted from their homes practically every day--in one day the sheriff's deputy evicts people from 24 homes! We also see the very rich people playing golf and having theme parties (""The Great Gatsby"" theme party, for example) and these wealthy people do in fact appear to be ridiculously out of touch with the real, painful problems of the poor. Just as one woman playing golf is hitting her golf ball, she is caught on camera saying that the poor are taking ""the easy way out."" What on earth was SHE doing when she was playing golf instead of maybe doing some charity work with the less fortunate? I never had the feeling that the rich people in their highly insulated communities around Flint ever truly understood the plight of the poor people.

Unfortunately, it is equally true that General Motors never signed a contract with the people of Flint to provide them with jobs and health insurance from cradle to grave. That's the way things go in our society--you or your employer can end the employment at any time, with or even without notice. I believe that's the case in most if not all fifty states. Naturally, this does not mean I don't feel great, great empathy and sympathy for those who were laid off; it's just that when GM closed those eleven plants we got an ugly reminder of just how rough this type of non-contracted employment can be.

I suppose Moore could have made his film a bit more balanced; to produce a solid documentary you really need to show both sides of the story. Moore tries to accomplish this by interviewing a friend of Roger Smith; but the footage Moore chooses to give us is that of a man who couldn't possibly care less about the General Motors employees.

The DVD is light on extras although we do get an optional commentary by Michael Moore.

Overall, Roger & Me is at times sad and at other times entertaining; we see a portrait of just how harsh ""free enterprise"" can be to the common man who depends on their weekly paycheck for survival. The humor we do get is not bad but Moore could have been a bit more even handed in his presentation of the issue. I nevertheless recommend this film for Michael Moore fans and people who study politics, political science and work related issues.

I was at the edge my seat from the first to last second of this truly superb, academy award quality, film.  We learn about how the hard working proletariat of the quaint village of Flint, Michigan have been foully betrayed by that behemoth of Capitalism--dare I say it--General Motors.

General Motors is outsourcing jobs to Mexico [?] and millions of people are being laid off.  Most of the unemployed people turn to lives of crime, basketball, alcoholism and rabbit killing.  It's absolutely disgusting--delicate women skinning rabbits to make fur coats for fat cat Capitalist women who never did a lick of real work.

Well, the General Motor Capitalists are doing right well for themselves in the midst of poverty and starvation.  They are eating carved food, drinking martinis, playing old ladies golf and forcing pitiful jackasses to jump into pools of water.  Did I say it was disgusting?  Fortunately, a film which had the potential to be truly crummy, is saved by Michael Moore's monotone.

Thank God for Michael Morre.  Thank God for the masses.  Thank God for the noble workers who make the United Auto Workers great.  And let General Motors, its fat cat executives and all Capitalists and Capitalism in general...eat strawberry cake...Nah!!  It's the guillotine, instead.

This film which happens to be - like all his other films - tremendoulsy entertaining is by no means a documentary. The reason: The extent to which Moore bends the truth is called even among the most unethical journalists ""lies"":

- Moore who in this picture tries to get to talk to the GM ceo Roger Smith DID GET to talk to him. Moore tried in vain to prevent his colleagues from admitting this, nevertheless the interview got printed by Premiere Magazine.
- According to witnesses in the stockholder meeting shown in the film, Moore did not get cut off when he asked questions to Roger Smith. Moore deliberately edited the scene in a way where it comes off that way. Often he takes quotes from interviewees out of context by letting parts end up on the cutting room floor. He himself admitted to this.
- The failed mall, hotel and autoshow were closed down prior to the layoffs and are hence not the result of them.
- Reagan visited Flynt in 1982 not in 1986 during the layoffs as claimed here.
- Moore doesn't mention anything about the impossible requests by the unions, which ultimately led to the heads of GM to contemplate foreign assembly.
- There are more reasons as to why the Academy Awards revoked an Oscar for Roger & ME, however I'm tired to waste any more time on this hypocritical, self absorbed former stockowner of Ely Lilly and Halliburton securities.

Michael Moore bends the truth, cashes in, and thus is just as much of a journalistic failure as his greedy right wing counterpart. He puts us left wing libertarians in a bad light.",1205798400,5,1706,4.535714285714286

346767,4,6301691687,"Although humorous and entertaining, one can understand why critics such as Pauline Kael and Harlan Jacobson have a problem with Michael Moore's approach to documentary filmmaking.  Indeed, from the audience's perspective, almost everyone Moore interacts with in Roger & Me looks callous, short-sighted, or inane through his lens; albeit for good reason.  In addition, once viewers become conscious of Moore's domineering edit techniques and chronological laxity, they may write off the valid arguments he does make.  But if Moore strictly adhered to documentary ethics, would Roger & Me still have been the most successful documentary of its time?  While there is no clean cut rebuttal to Moore's critics, each argument must be examined case by case, gauging their contextual validity.

  Perhaps the most piercing evidence of Moore's manipulation is his decision to omit the dialogue between him and Roger Smith during the 1987 GM shareholders meeting.  This point, in particular, is so pivotal because the film is driven by Moore's quest to speak with Roger Smith.  Moore could have easily not attended the meeting and therefore not even mention it.  This quandary alone realizes Moore's ability to direct the story as he pleases.  As the scene unfolds in the film, Roger Smith appears to be ignoring Moore's presence despite Moore's plea for questions.  Here, Moore shows conscious manipulation of an event; an indisputable example that he crossed the line.  Problematic scenes on this order of magnitude can completely shatter the viewer's trust in Moore as a documentary filmmaker and what we see on screen.  Jacobsen explains, ""[Roger & Me] has the form of documentary...we expect that what we are seeing there happened, in the way in which it happened, in the way in which we are told it happened.""

  On the other hand, one problem Moore's critics are overlooking is that they are lumping Roger & Me into the largely diverse and loosely defined genre known as ""the documentary,"" as if all films showing real footage of real people and events should be held to the same standards.  Roger & Me is a hodgepodge of Bill Nichol's documentary modes beginning with the participatory where Moore comments on his personal upbringing and explains how he became involved in filmmaking.  Most of Roger & Me progresses in participatory mode, however there are brief jaunts of expository mode where Moore recaps a series of events in ""voice of God"" narrative.  The film climaxes in poetic mode with a carefully choreographed juxtaposition of Smith's warm Christmas message of giving against the harsh images and sounds of a family being evicted; eliciting a contradictory response to Smith's speech.  If we also include Moore's style of slight manipulation, what typology of documentary is this?

  Like fiction films, the documentary genre has become increasingly more complex and experimental; blurring the boundaries of its classification.  Moore may have created a new sub-genre of documentary: one that combines Nichol's documentary modes in a heuristic visual essay where accurate historical representation is eclipsed by unbridled personal emotion.  Interestingly, Moore calls Roger & Me ""an entertaining movie that hopefully will get people to think a little bit about what is going on"".  If his intention is to galvanize the public, then does the end justify the means?  Does the fact that Roger & Me became the all time best selling documentary upon its release, exposing millions of people to important social issues through the powerful medium of film, justify the bending of truth in his films?  In retrospect, I agree with minor stipulation.  Is it ok that Moore ambushes people who have no idea of his agenda?  In response to Pauline Kael's article, I have no grievance with Moore's ambush interview technique towards people on the street or corporate PR representatives.  Kael questions ""what does Moore expect?""  I doubt Moore expects an insightful and well articulated response from everyone he speaks to.  However, Moore's strategy is effective at probing the collective consciousness of America for us to ponder.  All too often companies are given ample prep time to strategize a self-serving spin to public inquiry.  Moore's approach, in effect, catches them with their pants down.  In response to Moore's truth bending, although I disagree with Moore, perhaps he believed it was the only way to reach a broad audience when traditional documentary films and grassroots newpapers were dwarfed by Hollywood blockbusters and mainstream media.

  I am still somewhat at a loss in that I admire and respect Michael Moore for what he has achieved.  Moore provides a voice for those in the lower rungs of our hierarchal society--he is confrontational, he probes routine corporate operations, he reminds us not to become too complacent in our daily lives.  Still, some of his tactics are completely unethical and imposing.  I believe Moore has the ability to make entertaining and socially introspective films without the problems mentioned.  Whatever you call his films, one cannot deny that galvanizing public interest on social issues is a bad thing for America.",1175644800,2,5172,5.224514563106796
346768,3,6301691687,"Roger & Me debuted in 1988 and turned Michael Moore into an up-and-coming star in the populist media.  Narrated and produced by Mr. Moore, it examines the economic decline of his hometown, Flint, Michigan, due to the closing of several GM plants.  The name Roger refers to Roger Smith, the GM executive who was the force behind these closings.  The movie starts by showing Moore's childhood in Flint, and how the city grew rich on the automobile business.  Then came the announced closings.  The movie shows film footage from these events, such as the corporate announcements themselves, news footage both local and national, and reactions from Flint residents.  The movie then shows the gradual decline of the city such as store closings, bankruptcies, increased crime rates, and evictions of many citizens.  Throughout this decline, Mr. Moore tries to find Roger Smith so he can meet with him, and convince him to visit Flint.  Time and again Moore misses Roger, and the movie ends with him managing to confront Roger for several minutes at a banquet.

Interspersed throughout the movie are scenes of the wealthy citizens of Flint and how they are totally disconnected from the middle class and laid-off workers of Flint.  Also interspersed is footage of the various ridiculous things Flint citizens do after GM leaves them, such as growing rabbits for meat.

The point that this movie seems to be trying to convey is that GM closed the plants to reopen them in Mexico to boost profits, and not to postpone corporate losses.  It is here that movie is quite lacking in numbers and data.  For example, the movie should have shown the price of GM stock during this time frame, and also GM's profit line before and after the plant closings.  Another area where numbers would have helped is in showing Flint's decline.  The movie should have shown employment rates, city tax earnings, and crime rates in Flint before and after the plant closings.

In conclusion, this is a good, but not great, muckraking movie.  It is worth watching as a historical piece, and lends insight into the economic decline of the Midwest and Northeast.",1173571200,2,2127,4.896648044692737

This film was a major underground hit at the time, and it still is excellent today.  You really feel for the people who lose their jobs, and you're infuriated by the callous indifference of Roger Smith and the management of General Motors.  I really liked the segment where Flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the Midwest.  It consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a Hilton in downtown Flint, and opening up a theme park called Auto World.  It justs smacks of desperation and stupidity; it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time.  Instead of giving these people really good jobs again, they come up with this idiotic scheme, which ended up in disaster (both the Hilton and Auto World closed within a year).  Moore in recent years has become a ""political celebrity"", in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in America.  It's not just Moore doing it; right wingers like Hannity and Coulter have been doing it too.  They all got books; some of them got films; some of them have radio shows.  A lot of them aren't really interested in changing anything, as it might interfere with their livelihoods.  I don't know if Moore is like that or not.

the reason for the plant closings. Years of losses at GM have shown Moore's twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then - phoney  UAW sponsored lies to  shift attention away from the

Moore and others pretend GM management had dropped the ball, but GM lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff, let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain.

Moore will never mention how the UAW has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and

how now that consumers have a choice, they find the better value in Asian autos. Nobody wants to pay a UAW worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor. The UAW has fixed labor prices for long enough. Enough is enough and Moore

The scenes of parties for Flint's rich folks and GM executives, interspersed with poor workers being evicted from their homes, are great.  I also loved seeing Reagan and hearing the Flint citizens talk about how he was going to bring the jobs back.  This is the President who put our country on the road to bankruptcy.

Moore wants to save his home town and help people in poverty.  He's a sincere guy.  I'm less convinced that the proposals he has in mind would accomplish anything.  As I see it, the problem in Flint is not that GM is a bad corporate citizen, or that the government isn't doing enough to help the poor.  The real difficulty is that Flint's prosperity in the 50s and 60s was an illusion to begin with.  After the Second World War America chose to base its transportation system on the automobile.  This seemed to work OK for a while, because gasoline seemed to be plentiful and cheap.  Unfortunately, this approach to transportation had some nasty side effects.  It made our towns ugly and our people fat, not to mention changing the climate.  Today we're coming to the end of the era of cheap oil with the passing of Hubbert's peak.  Oil comes from millions of years' worth of stored sunlight, and when it's gone, it's gone.  In the next few decades getting around at all is going to become increasingly difficult.  We'll be wishing that we had invested in streetcar lines and walkable cities instead of all those freeways.  The automobile is still subsidized to the tune of billions of dollars in America today.  That's just money down a rat hole.

For more perspective on the dominance of the automobile in American life, I would suggest Kunstler's books ""The Geography of Nowhere"" and ""The Long Emergency.""  I also highly recommend Shoup's book ""The High Cost of Free Parking.""",1144972800,2,1878,4.6676829268292686

Whether or not you like they style of Moore's presentation, it is witty, backed by appropriately titled music and shows the almost incomprehensible response on the part of the city of Flint at this loss of future revenue (or, more bluntly, its threatened  economic survival) and in the joining the impact that corporate America can have on the lives of its citizens and the coldly calculated, dollars and cents approach to the bottom line, Moore succeeds in showing the viewer how both work with each other, as you often cannot have one without having both.",1140998400,6,1048,4.654054054054054

I believe that Moore counted on not being granted air time at GM for the production of this film.  An interview would have killed the tone.
  Watch the nightly news NOW.  Last night, March 22nd 2006, GM offered a one time buy out to some of it's employees.  The news reported that GM cannot afford to maintain its relationship with the UAW (Just like what caused the Flint situation in the film).

346798,5,6301691687,"Michael Moore's first major film was one of his best in my opinion for two reasons. First off, since he did not yet have a trademark style, he did not try to go over the top in this film as much as he does in his subsequent efforts. He does his normal routine of tracking people down in an effort to embarrass them by asking them pointed questions, but for most of the film he lets the story and the citizens of Flint do the talking. As you probably already know, this is the story of Moore's hometown, Flint, Michigan, and the utter despair that fell upon it after GM began shuttering auto plants under the supervision of then CEO Roger Smith. The film really highlights how clueless Flint's elite are as to the suffering that all of this ""consolidation"" is causing. At one point in the film Moore is talking to some wealthy people at a party who seem to think they are doing the unemployed some kind of favor by hiring them to act as living statues at one of their fetes. When he asks the partygoers about what is going on in Flint they seem somewhat offended that there is such ""negative publicity"" circulating and say there should be more emphasis on the positive things going on in Flint - they name the symphony and the opera. Ah yes, let them eat opera glasses! The second reason I consider this film to be one of Moore's best is that even though this film was made in 1989, it is still interesting and relevant today. This is because the contrast between what average working people have to endure - the struggle to find secure jobs with decent benefits and their increasing vulnerability - and the desire of the captains of industry to improve the bottom line at any cost ... as long as it doesn't cost them ... has only worsened and deepened over the last 17 years since this film was first made.",1135209600,6,1806,4.377976190476191

Irony is the best device to use in a documentary like this, and Moore loads the film with it: people being evicted while the rich are saying life is wonderful there, and the city investing millions of dollars in tourism but the tourists never come. The ultimate irony is found in the running interview Moore has with a GM p.r. man who argues for the good of the company - but at the end he's laid off, too. The movie goes on a bit too long and certain scenes seem to be there for effect only (for example, those with a woman who raises rabbits for food - we see her actually skinning one), but it's a good documentary nonetheless.",1135123200,,904,4.323529411764706

The thing that irks me about this movie is how poorly it defends the side of capitalism.  Essentially, capitalism has no voice.  Moore has obviously never taken a course in economics.

Why doesn't he make a movie about a socialist society?  Go to Cuba and film how awful the living conditions are there.  The people there will never live to see the day of 5% unemployment.  In case you didn't know, most European countries have well over 10% unemployment.  They'll never have any of the opportunities that even poor people enjoy here.  How would it be to live under a politburo where a bunch of old men sit around a table and decide what job you do, where you live, and how you live?

Capitalism gets a bad wrap because it's based on a theory that men will only do what's in their best interest.  It's interesting that this crazy theory, when applied in it's most purest form, has resulted in the wealthiest country in the world.  Make no mistake about this either, no one cares for their and the world's poor better than the U.S.

When the steel industry was gone, Lackawanna lost almost all of it's tax bracket. Whether or not General Motors ever leaving Flint would be bad for it, Moore shouldn't criticize the politicians there for trying to make the best out of a horrible situation.

In other areas, however, Moore is his usual obnoxious self, placing himself in impossible situations, and subjecting his victims to scruntiny when his miracle connection fails to happen.

Moore successfully brings the viewer into the plight of the Flint citizen, even though viewers may question the validity of his tactics in tracking down Roger Smith. If you're a fan of other Moore films, you will certainly enjoy this offering.",1107216000,,977,4.915151515151515
346819,4,6301691687,"Centered around the closing of the lifeblood of Flint, Michigan, its GM plant, Moore's controversial documentary hits home for a lot of points. While chasing GM chair Roger Smith, Moore records the devastating unemployment that results from the closing of the plant.

Normally, Moore stirs feelings of ""Stop being on my side! You make my side look bad!"" This time, however, I feel he hits the target. The devastation of unemployment he gets on tape, the horrible conditions some are forced to live in (including one woman who is forced to live off an income gained by selling rabbits for pets or food), and the increasing apathy of the GM corporation boils the blood and makes one wonder why justice is not served.

However, I was a bit put off by Moore's tactics of trying to hunt down Roger Smith. I can understand why he would feel the need to resort to such tactics as posing as a GM shareholder to get into the shareholders meeting, but I feel that his deception is inherently contradictory to the deception he is trying to unravel.

In short, this is a worthwhile film. It has good and bad points, but if one is willing to open the mind to new possibilities, it is easy to see why this film is worth a look.",1107129600,,1213,4.504545454545455
346820,5,6301691687,"Michael Moore, before he was as widely known as today, decided to make a movie about his hometown of Flint.  At the time, thousands of people had been laid off by GM as plants closed all over Flint.  Yet the higher ups of GM, including former head chairman Roger Smith, were making massive profits.  So Michael Moore, with the inaugural usage of his in-your-face tactics, decided he needed to find Roger Smith and show him what was happening to Flint.

Now, the movie is merely based on the idea of finding Roger, because much of the time is spent meeting local people, whether that be the Sheriff deputy who has to evict many of the people who formerly worked for GM, or whether it be the laid off workers themselves.

Even considering how this was Michael Moore's first film it still has visual quality, even with low budget editing.  However, one must remember that the focus is the story itself, a story that was worth telling.

Even now, though this story is old, it is still a great film to check out.  Simply put, times may change but layoffs linger.

(Oh, and don't forget this is Moore's first film, so it is extra valuable for the Michael Moore fans out there.  But they probably already know that.)",1104969600,4,1209,4.529953917050691
346821,2,6301691687,"Since this was his breakthrough, we can clearly see that this is not a great documentary. Some of the points Moore try to make the viewer swallow are never clear. for example, the scene with the lady killing the rabbit by apllying blows in its head. What for?

I did not enjoy this movie. It shows people getting ousted of their houses by judiciary orders, and shows their poor and indefense children. Come on, it's not GM's fault (or anybody's fault in the whole world!!!) that underpaid people have more children than they can take care of. Like Fred Ross (the guy who appears in the film and that applies the court decisions, you don't need help to be a poor man!

Other than this, the title is a swindle. Moore never gets to have an interview with Roger Smith (GM's CEO), only a brief exchange of words in some convention.

I disliked the movie, not because it shows ""Bad America"" (a fact all his movies deal about), but because I think it's not on the same level of BOWLING AT COLUMBINE or FAHRENHEIT 9/11.",1104796800,3,1011,4.454054054054054
346822,5,6301691687,"This documentary was made in 1988-1989 by Michael Moore with the ending approximately three years after 1988.  It was the documentary that made him somewhat famous you can say.  Anyway, this film details the closing of a General Motors factory and 30,000 people being laid off.  With this many people being out of a job, Flint becomes a city with a high crime rate, high numbers of eviction notices, people moving out of Flint, and a lot of people getting on welfare.  Moore has many interviews with people who discuss the positive side of outsourcing such as Bob Eubanks, some other famous Flint personalities, Miss Michigan, a GM lobbyist and many other people.

Whether you agree that a corporation should or should not outsource, both sides are shown.  In news media though, the devastating eviction notices and other things are never shown with such clarity and emotion.  When a chairman of a huge company such as GM does donate money or do anything philanthropic, they make sure there are plenty of press and PR people around.

Moore tries throughout this whole movie - over a course of three years to speak with Roger Smith, the chairman of GM.  One time he comes close during a shareholder's meeting but I don't want to ruin that part for you.

There is so much that happens in this documentary.  Flint tries to survive by becoming a tourist place, a new prison is open where rich people have a sleep over?!? Even though it is 2004, I believe that this movie was very well made for its time and even currently, has wonderful emotion and is a great documentary.",1103673600,3,1568,4.665454545454545
346823,3,6301691687,"This, and other old M. Moore works, will get alot of new attention. I hope that those seeing all his work will recognize  his material as extremely well-done propoganda. All his films are strong on emotion and narrow, over-simplified, out-of-context perspectives.

Just one example in this film is the butchering of the rabbit for meat. We're supposed to be shocked by this, as if it were some sort of desperate act of survival. Doesn't Moore know that that's exactly the way we get all our meat? Even if we have LOTS of money? I guess if you do it yourself instead of paying others to do it, it's a sign you're near starvation. I watched my father do exactly the same thing to many rabbits, and we had planty to eat and weren't poor or deperate.

Moore blows by the fact that the economy and jobs are all about change. Did all the residents of Flint just appear there? No. They moved from farms to Flint, and stayed there, for the good paying jobs. And make no mistake --- automotive assembly jobs are among the best paying in ALL of manufacturing. You can accuse GM of downsizing, but not of running low wage sweat shops.

Nothing, repeat, nothing lasts forever. The viability of their old agricultural life didn't last forever and their jobs in Flint didn't either.

In many ways the labor movement is the victim of it's own success. The unions were successful, jobs paid well and the families used the money to send their kids to college so that they wouldn't have to --- you guessed it --- work in a factory! But no one is accusing these families of ""abandoning"" their Father's employer.

Is the CEO of GM an arrogant, money hungry, indifferent jerk? Probably. But what else is new. He's in charge of a giant for-profit organization -- not a philanthropist. He has jobs, but offers no guarantees, just like the workers who take the jobs make no promises. If you want it, take it. If you can find something better, leave. If you have to relocate to better yourself, do it. Oh, and by the way, quit whining.",1101081600,6,2010,4.523415977961433

His first movie, ""Roger & Me"" is perhaps his best. Michael Moore is the voice to the voiceless in this true story about big business taking advantage of the little guy. GM closes it's factories in Flint, MI putting thousands of people out of work. The entire film revolves around the hardworking people of Flint as well as Moore's quest to find GM CEO, Roger Smith.

The movie is 15 years old, nevertheless it is still extremely realistic. We still have the same issues concerning the sluggish economy and corporate downsizing. Maybe the movie is even more powerful in 2004?

Michael Moore is a genius and I hope he will keep speaking up for the everyday workers of America. If you're interested in other Michael Moore projects I also recommend the movie Bowling for Columbine  & the book Downsize This! Random Threats from an Unarmed American.",1099094400,72,908,4.65625
346825,4,6301691687,"Micheal Moore has made a name for himself in Hollywood for his eye- opening documentaries. ""Roger and Me"", started it all, with a look at Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan and the ongoing economic problems faced by its citizens.

The reason the city of Flint was chosen isn't just because of its economic woes. It was also chosen because it is Moore's hometown. He grew up in Flint and his dad was an employee at one of the local General Motors plants. This background provides a good basis for making a documentary about GM and its influence on the local people of Flint. Moore has experienced the drama first hand, so he knows what it is like to witness people as they go from the assembly line to the unemployment line.

Roger Smith, the former chairman of GM, is the centerpiece of this documentary and Moore spends much of his time in the film trying to find Smith and conduct an interview with him. Smith eludes Moore throughout the documentary. Only on one occasion does Moore get a chance to talk directly with Smith- at a GM shareholder's meeting. And even then, the results are less than satisfactory because there is too little time to talk and Smith seems unprepared and defensive.

Humor, frustration, and devastation are all important ingredients of this documentary. I particularly enjoyed the scene with a woman who skins rabbits and uses their fur for her business. She just stands there, with the cameras rolling, butchering bunnies like its nothing. It' funny and weird at the same time to watch this woman willing to do whatever necessary to make a living. There are also plenty of scenes of the city of Flint, showing abandoned businesses, empty homes, and other sobering signs of a city in depression.

For a first- time documentary, I think this one is very good. Does it show all sides of the issue? Not really. Does it offer alternatives for those coping with the shutdown of assembly plants? No, it does not. It makes everything seem very helpless and tragic, which I exactly how Moore intended it to be. But it's still an interesting documentary to watch, with plenty of memorable moments and a message that causes one to think and rethink his/her stand on corporate influence and the effects of outsourcing and plant closures.",1099008000,5,2256,4.747448979591836

346828,4,6301691687,"Controversial filmmaker Michael Moore made this documentary in 1989 but it is sadly still very pertinent for American life in 2004, it is still a tale of big corporations making a mountain of money at the expense of middle class and poor workers.

Michael Moore is a pest, irritating and opinionated to the ninth degree but I admire him like no other, what other American is willing to take as many stabs at his reputation and just keep on filming the truth? I agree that some of his films have moments that go over the top for conservative Republican types but for us humble left wingers he remains one of our richest voices against the machine called ""corporate America."" Moore is thinner and youthful in this film from 1989 but he was just as badgering and willing to take a fall then as he is now. In this film he takes on the devastating affect that GM and its Chairman, Roger B. Smith make on the town of Flint, Michigan when they choose to close down the manufacturing plant located there. Moore is filmed in his many attempts to meet with Smith only to be met by constant refusals; it seems Smith wasn't able to stand up to his own heat! One subject in the film states that the corporate world is all about making money and this film brings that awful truth to a head as 18,000 workers loose their jobs in Flint, MI.

Moore has a way of filming that sets forth the truth, adds a touch of humor and then stops your heart. He shows how the rich only get stronger, while under the blanket of corporate security, while the security the workers expect can be pulled out from underneath them before they have a chance to right themselves. GM was financially strong during the time this film was made but it still decided to lay off over 30,000 workers from several plants in America so that it could move the facilities to Mexico and only have to pay the new workers seven cents an hour.....well you just can't beat that, right? Amazingly so this very same issue is a forefront in today's political agenda, do we, or don't we? I believe Moore is trying to say no! When American workers suffer with layoffs and entire town devastations the rest of America eventually suffers as well, unless you live in a manor overlooking a lake and have the letters CEO attached to your name of course. Moore follows Roger B. Smith to private clubs and films a Christmas speech while intermittently showing the GM workers being physically evicted from their homes. Pretty powerful stuff!

Many aspects of this film are significant, some of the cleverest scenes revolve around displaced workers trying to make ends meet and the continuous stream of people being forcibly evicted from scraps that they have made into homes. Where can the justice be in a woman with small children being taken from a home with a caved in roof, should rent really be paid on a rat hole? I can just imagine the landlord on Christmas day! Another scene that bothered me is one in which a woman tries to make a living by skinning her rabbits; it's a brutal scene and not one for animal lovers or anyone who disguises where the meat on their table came from. So the saga of Flint continues and hopefully the heart of Michael Moore will carry on until this very American problem is resolved, the middle class is becoming poor and the poor falling off the face of the earth into oblivion if we keep up what we are doing. For now we need Moore's unwavering voice to spread the bad news and hope for a better way because ""Roger"" could be coming to your town next.",1094342400,23,3520,4.479750778816199
346843,2,6301691687,"Michael Moore's documentary style film, ""Roger and Me"", intimately addresses the social demise of his hometown, Flint, Michigan, during the 1980's as a result of General Motor's automobile plant closing. It was released at a time when the Temporary Staffing industry reigned supreme and labor organization memberships had fallen dramatically. Michael's chosen film topic could not have hit a more salient nerve for the many who were experiencing the repercussions of manufacturing job migration to foreign countries and the ensuing disintegration of worker rights across the United States.

The bulk of the film consists of filmed interviews between Moore and various members of the community which is falling apart after GM closes its doors and leaves many jobless. He films a local sheriff serving eviction notices while commenting to the camera on the solidity of his job security. He films a young women selling rabbits for ""pets or meat"". The filming continues as Michael, who lets us know that he is finally fed-up, approaches the GM Headquarters building or local country club in pursuit of Roger Smith, GM CEO, who is responsible for the plant shutdown. Of course, the Executive will have nothing to do with Moore and his film. Failed civic revitalization efforts by community leaders and goverment workers, and career change failures by former GM employees are caught on reel. ""Roger and Me"" muses at the upbeat or morbid attempts of those attempting to ward off economic doom and the indifference of a wealthy, elitist society.

In my view, this film succeeds in hitting the viewer squarely where it most counts - with emotional impact. It's not difficult for the average middle to low income American to identify with a message that greed and corruption are synonymous with Corporate identities and thus its most prominent attribute. How many of ""us"", the masses, understand the workings of the world economy and globalization. How many of ""us"" deeply endeavor to read Rand's novel ""Atlas Shrugged"" or Chomsky's ""Understanding Power""after putting in 8-12 hours of work a day? ""We"" do feel emotions when see the filming of family, including a small child peering into the camera, while being evicted from their home and then see the CEO responsible for thousands of jobless workers quoting the heart-warming words of Dickens during a business Christmas party speech.

Moore fails at providing a balanced view because he does not firmly address the reasons for the GM plant closing. Were labor costs far too high for an aging plant to remain profitable? Or was Roger Smith simply looking for a way to provide yet another lining in his and the shareholders pockets? Moore states the latter, but never proves it.

There is not a strong coherency between the events in the film and the claims made by Moore. The woman selling rabbits for ""pets or meat"" plainly states in the film that she took up the business to supplement the Social Security Survivor benefits that she receives. The Survivor benefit is received as a result of her husband's accidental drowning death not job loss at the local plant. But Moore throws this into his anti-GM crusade as evidence of the communities decline and supposes that no one will see the lack of continuity. Further, he doesn't miss filming a live rabbit getting clubbed in the head before butchering and apologizes in the DVD commentary for ""accidentally"" filming the event. Yet the film clip was included in the movie??? The event has to be considered brutal and emotionally charging to those not accustomed to slaughtering their own meat (or Mafia style murder) and, of course, anger over the poor bunny's death will be naturally misdirected at the GM Exec.

However, Moore's film fails in other important measures. The phrasing ""so-called documentary"" is applied to ""Roger and Me"" because many critics have attacked the notion that it, as well as Moore's other films, fit the film industries universally recognized film-documentary criteria; criteria that I am not versed on. I am well-versed on the facts surrounding some of the topics that are displayed in Moore's films, such as U.S. history, welfare reform and poverty, and am alarmed at some of his false statements and shoot-from-the-hip comments he makes. This film is less volatile than his most recent films in that arena, unless watching the film with Michael's most recently added commentary on the DVD format. Moore's commentary is standard Left-wing rant.

Yet Moore gets away with accolades probably because it appeals to the vast majority of viewers. He appeals to the viewer's emotions very well and puts us face-to-face with ugliness of poverty and indifference to suffering.",1093564800,7,4690,5.092327698309493
346844,5,6301691687,"I don't know where to begin with this review. As a huge fan of American hero Michael Moore who brought us the controversial ""Bowling For Columbine"" and the politically powerful ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", I was more than compelled to check out his first documentary of his career, 1989's heartbreaking ""Roger and Me"" which is an important documentary that everyone from all over the political spectrum should at least take some time to watch.

 Set in his home town of Flint, Michigan, ""Roger & Me"" focuses on then General Motors Corporate CEO Roger Smith who became CEO in January of 1981. This man was a catastrophic disaster in the makings. During the 1900s and all the way into the 1960s, Flint, Michigan was a thriving community and often had numerous celebrations as one of the economic powerhouses of the Midwest. However, when Smith closed down the General Motors plants to open new ones in Mexico, the results were utterly devastation to the extent that Flint, Michigan has never really recovered from.

 This documentary, Moore's first of his career, sets it's sight into the plight of the working citizens and residents of the city of Flint, and what they went through when enduring the massive hardships that enshrouded them. One of the scenes I couldn't digest was where a sheriff would evict impoverished residents who could no longer afford to pay their rent and one of these was really angering to watch which I'm not going to give out out of fear of spoiling it.

 The city of Flint especially with what it once was is now one of the saddest stories of American history. As Michael Moore says dueing a commentary on the DVD, it has only gotten worse in the years since this came out in 1989 and that it has been virtually left to fade away into the background.

 Wherever you lie on the political spectrum, this is a worthwhile watch and really peers into the effects of such a heinous, callous, and horrific act of corporate greed and what the effects of Smith's actions have had on Flint Michigan.

 Although I've never been to Flint but I would say that even if it is a really downtrodden place, it still has some good qualities, like all other American cities. If Flint is to become a thriving place again then it would be a wonderful thing.",1093478400,7,2253,4.666666666666667

Then, out of the blue - GM announces that they are closing the factory and moving to Mexico. Flint is destroyed. It now looks more like an Eastern European ghost city, its factory closed, houses borded up, empty dirty streets. One of those who lost their jobs was Michael Moore's father. Michael sets out to tell his father's story to the head of GM, Roger. The film is partly a bout Flint. All the failed attempts to bring new business to the town, and the various ways the inhabitants try to cope. The stupidity of the Town Council is amazing. Moore does not give them their jobs back, but he rescues them from anonymity; he gives them a voice, and a face. He tells that behind the profit margins, behind the business strategies, we have human beings. Humans with dreams and emotions, just like Roger. They do not have a Board, or millions of dollars backing them though. We also follow Michael Moore's hilarious attempts at meeting with Roger, just to ask him to go to Flint.
This is Moore's first film. In many ways it is is best, because it is so close to his heart. Hilariously funny, and hearbreaking at the same time. The episode of the rabbit lady, and the rather dim Miss Michigan, are minor classics.",1090195200,9,1343,4.530864197530864

Micheal Moore laughs all the way to the Bank. And all he has done for the documentary is nothing. Because his films are propaganda, not documentaries. Documentaries present balanced views on issues or historical events.
And by the way, you might ask yourself, where is the HIGH PROFILE look by Newsweek or Time or Dateline or 60 minutes regarding the facts in Fahrenheit 911? There isn't one. There are only interviews with Mr. Moore further expousing his viewpoints. Since there would certainly be plenty of interest in such a show or article, we are left to draw our own conclusions: A) too much real work would be involved in chasing down the facts as opposed to asking Mr. Moore questions and nodding while he talks B) the real facts don't support the media's outlet's agenda of electing John Kerry.",1089590400,10,998,4.808139534883721
346848,5,6301691687,"In 1993, I took a graduate seminar in documentary film making and was introduced to ""Roger and Me"".  Unfortunately, for Michael Moore, there are so many people tied up in the political implications of his work that they fail to realize that ""Roger and Me"" is probably the best documentary film of all time in terms of style, content and presentation.
This movie is an expose on General Motors closing of several plants in Michigan and the subsequent effects of those plant closings.  Nuff Said...It happened...so you can be pissed at GM for moving its factories to Tijuana where they can get workers for 33 cents/hour or, you can buy into Adam Smith's classical economic hypothesis put forth in ""Wealth of Nations"" and think that GM did the rational thing.  The question is, how do you present this information to the uninformed world?
In terms of style, Moore's narrative is historically rich and laced with deadpan sarcasm.  Many people have criticized the film for its ""biased"" presentation of fact.  Wake up!  This is not a CNN news broadcast, nor it it a press relase.  It is a documentary, and as such, it must have a thesis.  Moore presents a strong thesis: General Motors does not give a damn about suffering of American workers.  He backs it up with statistics and qualitative content in his narrative.  There is never a question left unanswered about why GM did what it did and what the official company line was on the issue.  For a good documentary to work, you see it has to fill in some blanks, therefore, the film should not be criticized for being ""biased"".
While the content of ""Roger and Me"" gives the viewer a healthy dose of the consequences of class-war, the true art is in the way that these consequences are presented.  In Roger and Me, Moore proves that he is the master of ""quick-cutting"" from the sublime to the shocking.  Such sharp edits have to be admired. For example, at one point Moore is interviewing some upper-class people in a beautiful pastoral setting.  They are talking about how people should ""take control of their situation"" if they do not have a job.  Then suddenly, the film cuts into to a run-down neighborhood where families are being evicted from their homes.  Moore uses this technique several times in Roger and Me cutting from the innocuous settings of the upper-class to the harsh realities of the working-class.  The effect is as devistating to the viewer as going 60 MPH and then running smack into a brick wall.
While you may disagree with Moore's politics, people should at least appriciate what he has done for the documentary film-genre.",1089504000,20,2594,4.754464285714286
346849,4,6301691687,"""Roger & Me"" is one of Michael Moore's earliest pieces of work.  It is quite apparent that Moore has always had a knack of being an investigative journalist - seeking out the truth and attempting to present equal air time for both sides.  Moore's valiant and persistent efforts to reach out to Roger Smith, Chairman of GM, are admirable.  It was rather intriguing to see how so difficult it was to get through to Mr. Smith.  My interpretation of such a struggle to get to one important individual is a reflection of the American people's frustration with the system and the politicians.
The ""two Americas"" that John Kerry and John Edwards speak of, are clearly exemplified throughout this movie ranging from the elites within GM and those being evicted from their homes at Christmas time.  An excellent movie to watch if you want to get a glimpse into what America really is like.",1089244800,7,880,4.7254901960784315
346850,3,6301691687,"Michael Moore is one intriguing cat.  Love him or hate him, the man has definitely made a lasting impact on the American public, especially with his new ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".  Having never actually seen a Moore documentary, I decided to start from the roots of his increasing success: the critically-acclaimed docu-comedy ""Roger and Me"".  As shrewdly assembled as it was, it came off as a mixed bag, a testament of Moore's cunning as well as his provocative anger and misinformation.
""Roger and Me"" is the epic story of then-magazine editor Michael Moore leaving his beloved hometown of Flint, Michigan, a leading center of General Motors Manufacturing Plants.  Moore had it pretty good in Flint, as he said.  His family was doing well, and ""every day was a good day.""  When he discovers that, as he puts it, California and himself were a ""mismatch"", he returns to Flint, only to find that GM has closed several plants, relocating to Mexico and abroad.  The town's gone from boom to bust in the blink of an eye.  Naturally, thousands of Flint workers have been laid off, and animosity fans the flames of blame on Roger Smith, the chairman of GM, for the workers' turmoils and unemployment.  Moore and his crew, one of them being a relative of Ralph Nader, go to work to film the troubles of Flint, and relentlessly attempt to talk to The Man.
While it is benevolent of Moore to care about the oppression of his fellow Flint-mites (as he shows on camera), he hadn't lived in Flint for about a decade when he made this movie.  He was so determined to get out, he said, to make a new life for himself.  Why should've he cared?  And there are moments, especially as the film progresses, as he continually harasses GM security guards and clubhouse secretaries for an appointment with Mr. Smith, where you want to ask him, ""Is it really worth it?""  Truth be told, this film is not as funny as people would have you believe.  Moore sometimes comes off more as an overbearing nutball than a satirical champion of the political left (wait, aren't most of them nutballs?), and the rabbit-skinning sequence goes on too long and may sicken some viewers.  It's the primary reason why this film got an R-rating,  plus a scene where an angry mother re-enacts Hiroshima with F-bombs galore as she gets evicted, and in front of her little toddlers.  Speaking of, the eviction scenes are very depressing, and do show to a certain extent, the sad state the unemployed were in and failure by the city to get off the pot more than it did.  However benevolent the city is for Flint to reform, that doesn't keep them from being named the worst city in America.
This film isn't bad.  It can be enjoyable.  Moore does have a shrewd way of exploiting aristocratic snobbishness, and the notion of what goes around comes around.  See what happens at the end to GM executive Tom Kay, a prominent defender of his company throughout his encounters with Moore.  By the way, this film proves that Bob Eubanks is a boorish imbecile.  Plus, Smith's dismissal of Moore at a GM investors conference comes off as very provocative.  However, there are some he exploits who don't really deserve it.  What can Miss Michigan do about it?  Plus, were some of those evicted from their homes really working for GM?  Moore doesn't tell you.
Overall, ""Roger and Me"" is an OK, but not a fantastic documentary, displaying a dubious and sometimes frustrating presentation, while at the same time delivering some provocative emotions and revelations that'll give you some food for thought.  It seems that Flint hasn't improved much since 1989, with the unemployment rate hovering around 10%.  However, ""Roger and Me"" is definitely not intended to be fair and balanced, and it seems that the phrases, ""Where do we go from here?"", or ""I will present the solution!"" aren't in Moore's vocabulary, as least not at this point.  Who knows, maybe ""Bowling for Columbine"" will prove me wrong.

346852,5,6301691687,"This is quite possibly one of the most important movies in the last 20 yrs. Michael Moore by putting his own passion and blood into the making of this movie, showing corporate greed at all levels from political to civil , got an Oscar for this film and he pretty much cemented himself as one of the bravest and strongest directors ever.
Shot on location in Flint Michigan, with real people including former corrupt President Ronald Reagan, this movie it as real as it gets. It pretty much started the whole documentaries on exposing corporate greed and well the downhill and moral decline of America (also shown in ""The Big One"" and ""Bowling for Columbine"" (which won the Oscar for Michael Moore).
Before I get more into depth of the movie, I asked you to remember these image in your heads to show you how sad the situation in Flint Michigan both in 1989 and 2003 are:
In the movie while General Motors is showing profits of over a billion dollars,they disgusting laid off over 25,000 factory workers. I repeat General Motors was showing a profit, not a loss, yet they decided to lay of thousands of people basically giving them a death sentence.
Most factory workers didn't have the money to pay for their mortgage and were evicted,during one scene in the movie as many as 25 people in one day were evicted even on Christmas Eve.
To show the real disgusting situation. A poor and mentally disturbed woman by the name of Rhonda Britton is so desperate to get money for her kids that she tries to sell Rabbits as pets. When that doesn't work she ends literally killing these poor animals and selling them as meat!!!! Which includes skinning them alive!!! The real sad part is that there a million dollar GM hotel only a few yars from where this women is doing this acts to get any form of help for herself.
Basically Flint , Michigan as shown in the movie, from once a booming celestial center of action, is now a corrupt, poor , and crime infested city with no hope even amidst the lies of former Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Reagan's promise that they ""would change the situation"".
In fact Reagan as shown in the movie uses Flint basically as a campaign ploy to elect himself during the 1980's. It's disgusting.
Now the plot deals with General Motors and their disgusting actions of laying of well basically everyone who works for them in the factory. Even amidst Union groups like UAW , and booming profits, GM pulls the most disgusting acts reported in corporate history.
So Michael Moore seeing the situation that is happening, makes this movie as he puts it during the trailer ""I did this movie to raise the spirits of the workers"". Indeed he did, but more importantly he showed America and the world corporate greed up close and personal and the many people covering up the lie that all is well on GM.
For instance Anita Bryant, Bob Eubanks and Pat Boone are 3 disgusting American celebrities who basically are hired by GM to fool the town into thinking everythings nice at Flint Michigan. They hire them for Carnivals, parades, tourism, nything. In Eubanks case as shown in the film, this self indulgent pig is promoting his newlywed game. Eubank is one of the first celebrities that Moore exposes. Eubanks at first seeing Moore doesn't think that Moore won't do much damage.
And thats the big mistake that everyone at Flint Michigan does as quoted in the commentary by Moore ""getting an interview with these people was easy...because they just took look one look at me and figured oh this isn't going anywhere"".
My God how wrong those people are. As stated in the first sentence where Eubanks shows his antisemetic joke, he obviously didn't think Moore's movie would have any impact. but furthermore, Eubanks is the typical example of every greedy American pig in the movie. He thinks because he has power he can treat and offend those who don't have power and those who aren't around to listen to his offensive remarks.
Again backed up by Moore's commentary ""This people thought they could be offensive ecause the groups that they were being offensive too weren't there."" True cowardism and Moore's shows that too.
The movie moves on to show the Union groups attempt to gain their jobs back and get GM to turn the situation around but they fail. One of the reasons they failed is because the Union Managers themselves kept giving concessions to GM, meaningly they gave into GM demands without getting anything in return.... True stupidity.
The movie then shows us Moore's attempts to talk to and question the main man behind the GM scandal Roger Smith, the chairman and Ceo of Gm (this old greedy (...) is no longer the head of Gm).
Moore's attempts go awry at first, apparently Smith has goons stopping him and people like Ralph Nader from exposing the greedy Smith. Eventually though using the fact that people underestimate him Moore does meet Smith (for 2 minutes basically) before Smith hightails it ouf there and Moore is removed from security from the Gm building at Chrismas no less!!! Where Smith aware of the unemployment, and crime wave hitting the city as a result of the layoffs still seeks to spew his lies and image of Gm into the media.
Special Features of the DVD include the original trailer

346863,5,6301691687,"There was once a man named Jim Treleven who put several years of hard work in as part of the Fond du Lac, Wisconsin City Council.
Jim's effectiveness was not necessarily  that he was right all the time, but he was passionate in his aldermanic arguments and was not afraid to ruffle some feathers.  Although Jim made some mistakes, he managed to stir up issues sometimes when they most needed stirring up and things got done.
I see Michael Moore much the same way as I see my friend Jim. He may not always be on the mark, but he is a passionate defender of the ideas of his constituents.  I give Michael Moore at A+
for bravery and willingness to take on ""the system.""
In some ways, Moore is the like the student in the back of the room shooting spit balls, just to get a reaction from the teacher, but he is also a strong defender of every man..the common man, against the arrogance of the elite, and there is certainly enough of that to go around.  That is way Michael deserves 5 stars for his effort putting together this film.
I hope Moore has a long and productive life and is not embittered by his angry detractors.

If it takes someone like Moore to shed some light on topics, then so be it.  Roger and Me is easily one of Moore's most piercingly honest films, and that's what many don't like.  Moore's movie was one of the few to deal with massive corporate layoffs of the 80's, something that today is more relevant than ever.
So the best way to judge Moore's film is to actually see it for yourself only to come to a sad conclusion that matters of corporate power and greed have only taken a turn for the worse from the time Roger and Me was released.",1087948800,3,732,4.328467153284672

This is the preferred method of con artists, who desire to use truth to build their larger lies. This is the identified method of Michael Moore, and the fact that this is his method is that with which is known by me and millions of humans capable of reading and analyzing information.

His journey takes him through the desolate areas of Flint, Michigan where Smith decided to close the GM plants and move the company to Mexico where wages were cheaper.  Thousands and thousands of people were now unemployed, families were torn apart, crime skyrocketed and the city of Flint became one of the worst cities to live in according to Money magazine.  A woman was raising rabbits for food.  This was, for me, the most disturbing part of the documentary.  She first describe how she killed the bunnies then she gave a demonstration, which I couldn't bring myself to watch.  City Council tried to revive the city by building a theme park; closed after 6 months, a Hyatt hotel which went bankrupt.  The only new building that lasted was a five story jail which had to be built because the old one was filled to capacity.  This is a truely horrible thing to happen to people.  Moore goes along with the Deputy and watches as he has to evict families from their homes.. even on Christmas eve.

Big corporations cutting corners so they can collect all the wealth and pay their employees practically nothing until one day they decide to lay everybody off and move to Mexico where they can pay people even less while the American people suffer. Watching people being evicted from their homes was heart breaking. Especially the women being kicked out on Christmas Eve with her small children watching. There is a huge gap between the wealthy and the poor in this country and it is growing. And places like Wal-Mart are only making things much worse. Bravo to Michael Moore for exposing people like Roger Smith and all the other low life fat cats. I hope Michael Moore really lays into George W.

There were a lot of causes for the layoffs that destroyed the city's economy; GM consumers, the global economy, GM shareholders, the list goes on.  But what was really lamentable was GM's ready disassociation with Flint.  As if the town that was part and parcel in creating one of the world's wealthiest companies was something they could just dispose of like a worn out part of one of their cars.
Any and all investments GM made in Flint were shallow and solely for the purpose of PR.  If nothing else they proved to be humorous.  But absolutely meritless.
What is left of Flint, MI today, and if what is left is salvageable, I can't tell you.

I may not see eye-to-eye with him on a lot of things, but this was one entertaining film!  This is the one that made his career what it is today.  Highly praised by critics and audiences all around, ""Roger & Me"" proves to be a fascinating documentary filled with humor and heart.
The film revolves around the closing of General Motors factories in Flint, Michigan.  The closings causes families to lose their homes, their jobs, and most of all their well-being.  Michael Moore is determined to get General Motors Chairman Roger Smith to come down to Flint and see the devastation his company has caused.  Of course, just trying to MEET the man throws all sorts of obstacles in Moore's way... and it's all caught on film!  All of this equals an entertaining documentary that is unpredictable and untamed.
I'm not that big on documentaries, but I have to admit that I enjoyed this one.  Michael Moore does an excellent job of bringing to light problems that may seem so insignificant to the rest of the world.  And he's determined too, which is why this all works.  He tries so many times to get in touch with Roger, no matter what kind of trouble he runs into.  His passion is easily observed through this movie, that's for sure.
The DVD isn't the grandest of DVDs.  It's not in widescreen, but for a movie like this it really isn't that big of a problem (I'm not even sure if this was originally shot in widescreen or not).  The picture and sound quality is pretty good, considering how old it is.  The theatrical trailer and commentary are the two special features on the DVD.  I think an important film of this caliber should've received better DVD treatment, but what can you do?  It is what it is.

Michael Moore made a film that through irony, humor, and a host of hard hitting and subtly emotional scenes, translated the bittersweet, frustration wrought demise of working class ANYTOWN U.S.A.
It always seemed to me that he filmed it in Flint simply because it was familiar territory, and he used GM and Roger as his vehicle (excuse the pun) purely to supply contiguity and to keep the body of his film somewhat linear.

346952,5,6301691687,"""Roger and Me"" is a wonderfully bitter documentary by Michael Moore, tracking Moore's attempts over the course of three years to get a face-to-face interview with Roger Smith, CEO of GM, which crippled the city of Flint, Michigan by closing its factories and relocating to Mexico. Ostensibly, this is to save money, according to GM's spin doctors, but this makes no sense because they're one of the most profitable corporations in the world at the time they close the factories.
When Moore realizes he can't nab an interview with Smith, he instead focuses the film on the effects Flint is suffering following their primary income source's departure.
For the broad scope of things, Moore watches a parade whose route passes countless boarded-up windows and dilapidated buildings. He follows a sheriff's assistant who looks almost bored as he evicts numerous people from their homes in the month leading up to Christmas. And he tracks embarassing attempts from the powers-that-be to improve the city through stupid ideas like an indoor theme park celebrating GM's history in Flint and a towering hotel that nobody in the city could afford to stay in.
On personal levels, Moore speaks to a high school classmate getting evicted from his house, an assembly line worker-turned-prison guard who observes he's in charge of a number of ex-coworkers, and an assembly line worker who committed himself to a mental institution the day the last plant closed because he couldn't take being fired by GM for the fifth time in as many years.
And through it all Moore keeps us from turning away in disgust by making us laugh, peppering the documentary with snide comments and asides about the upper class (like the country club folks who say none of these problems would happen if the auto workers just went out and got new jobs---kind of hard to do with the rest of the city closing down in a domino effect, folks) and GM's spokesperson who refuses to do her job and speak to Moore, while the people doing their jobs are getting fired.

346954,5,6301691687,"Michael Moore directed this thought-provoking movie documenting GM's massive plant closures in Flint, Michigan.  The ensuing layoffs plunge Flint into a terrible situation - it becomes crime-ridden and destitute and is selected as Money magazine's Worst Place to Live in the US.
Moore is obviously opinionated - he backs the ""stakeholder"" view of corporations that says that corporations must be obligated to their employees, the community, etc., as well as their shareholders.  It's not a view I completely agree with.  And many might be turned off watching this movie finding it's got a strong liberal political bent.
Still, Moore isn't making fools of his characters.  They're doing so themselves. At a ""Great Gatsby"" party, the well-to-do give interviews dressed in cashmere sweaters with canes and luxurious furs, calling the poor lazy, while hiring auto workers to play ""living statues.""  Four rich elderly women golfers, none of whom have ever worked in their lives, call the auto workers lazy for not finding new jobs.  A lobbyist for GM calls the layoffs necessary and healthy, and is in turn laid off himself.  It's hilarious and at the same time very disconcerting.  The emnity between rich and poor in the movie is obvious and seems to come from another era.
The town government's solutions to its problems are even worse: Build Autoworld, a $100 million tourist attraction (which closes for lack of interest within a few months)!  Build a massive hotel and convention center (which attracts a Scrabble convention, and that's about it)!  Retrain the auto workers - with crime exploding, they can be guards in the new jail!
Flint's problems are obviously very real.  Moore's question is a very valid one: is this the necessary result of capitalism and corporate cost-cutting?  Should we as a society try for a better solution?  Could we have done better in Flint?  After seeing this movie, it's difficult to justify ignoring the problem.
The question is how to respond.  Moore seems to see the movie as a statement of good vs. evil.  I find the problem is much more difficult.  GM at the time was being killed off by inexpensive, high-quality Japanese imports, and had a cost structure that was too high.  Its shareholders clearly wanted higher profits.  Was it rational to move jobs to Mexico, which would save costs tremendously?  From a corporate and shareholder standpoint, yes.  Corporations have to deal with ethical dilemmas like these constantly, since their ultimate obligation is to their shareholders, the owners, and shareholders want their money to make good returns.  Corporations risk making themselves look very bad in the process, as GM certainly does here.  But is that enough to prevent a company from making such decisions?  And is it healthy for the economy as a whole to prevent companies laying off employees domestically (as is done in Germany right now, with often very detrimental effects to its companies)?  Good questions, and good of this movie to raise them.",1039564800,13,2999,5.071428571428571
346955,5,6301691687,"I watched this film in the theater way back in 1989 as a freshman in high school and it opened my eyes to an entire reality that I had no idea existed.  I knew there were disgruntled people in the world, but I had never seen them voice their problems through film.  Michael Moore became an immediate personal hero and has yet to disappoint me.  Sure, his tactics can be criticized.  Sure, we can all complain that he is too biased or too personally involved with his subject matter to be objective.  But, his message is what is important.  I don't have to agree with him 100% of the time to realize his value to an ever increasingly apathetic nation.  It is refreshing to see someone stand up and disagree with what they find unacceptable.  It is our much underused priviledge to speak out at things we find unjust.  It is our duty.

The film has some brilliant moments, and is an exercise in masterful editing. (The shots of Roger Smith reading the Christmas Carol during one families eviction is especially effective.  As is Bob Eubanks and his indignant response toward the use of the word 'Breast' on his show, immediately followed by a later cut of him telling a racist joke.)  And the 'cast of characters,' the real people, are just as unique.  The Bunny Lady and the head of the tourism bureau are standouts.
If you are looking for a bitter dose of truth, this certainly will not disappoint.

Actually, he did- the man towards the end who I think Moore knew in school used to work at GM. And leaving the local economy crippled is certainly a link- it's not just coincidence that people started being evicted at greater rates, the prison population rising and people leaving the area when the plant started making massive layoffs.",1034985600,,425,4.916666666666667
346969,5,6301691687,"First off, I consider myself to be right-of-center when it comes to social and political issues. I'm conservative in most respects and I often don't agree with Moore's viewpoints. Knowing his left-leaning slant on everything helps one to decipher this film. But that doesn't mean he doesn't make good points. This film is a bit heavy-handed and at times borders on propaganda. Nevertheless, I think it's HILARIOUS. I grant the points stated by some others that:
a) GM did not butcher rabbits (did that lady look to be a person who would hold down a steady job!?)
b) GM did not evict persons from their homes (though we see people being evicted. What does this have to do with GM?)
c) What is the point of trying to manufacture cars in an outdated plant? Whether GM could have/should have built a new plant on that site is another matter entirely
Life is tough all over and you can go to any city ANYTIME (heck, even in the 'sticks') and there is bound to be someone being kicked out of a home for some reason (it's happening here in Chicago to lots of people in public housing projects-where will they go?). I'm sure Moore was trying to forge a link between people getting laid off at GM and kicked out of their homes. I don't remember him specifically showing GM workers getting kicked out of their homes so I don't believe he was sucessful in that regard...he was more sucessful in convincing me that Flint, Michigan is one of the [worst] dumps in all of America.
The question is, is that GM's fault? Not solely. Flint, like many cities in the industrial north has seen its day come and go. Any student of urban studies-such as myself-would probably agree that the decline of Flint has as much to do with its SIZE as anything else. The smaller the town, the less 'draw' it has for industry, sales, and tertiary trades and commerce. The close proximity of Chicago and Detroit don't help either. In that respect Moore fails to convince me that GM is solely responsible for Flint's ills. You have to watch the film with a sense of humor and take Moore's arguments with a grain of salt. After all, MONEY magazine named Flint the worst town in America-I'm sure it had to do with MANY issues, not just the economic sphere, of which (admittedly) GM was a big part. Yet Moore makes some important (though obvious) points and raises some thorny questions:
a) What is corporate responsibility? To workers and cities or to shareholders? Often they are one in the same.
b) How do we deal with crumbling industrial-age cities?
c) What other circumstances lead to the decay of older urban areas?
d) Moore implies that it is immoral to treat workers in the manner in which they are treated in the film. But perhaps the 'worker vs. corporation' view of the issue is too myopic?
Moore is famous for his outspoken agenda(s). He's [mad] (rightly so) and you can tell that in the film. But just because we don't like something, does that make it wrong? Conversely, just because we like something, does that make it right? I do think that GM has an obligation to retain American jobs, but whether or not that is in Flint is their (and ultimately the shareholders) decision.
The reason the film is so funny is that many of the big-wigs do look like morons parroting the same old stories, and the attempts by the city to foster growth and rejuvenation are laughable. Pat Boone, Anita whats-her-name, and Eubanks from the game show...hilarious. (And what's the deal with the human statues at that party? What a creepy place.) This is civic government in all its inept glory! The bits about the news van being stolen and the guy in the middle of the street with the Superman outfit and rifle always cause me to laugh uncontrollably. Perhaps Flint is merely that unlikely black hole to which all the worst elements of our society and human nature are drawn? Or is that Gary, Indiana? Actually, I think Florida is absorbing all the stupid people right now...
All I know is that when I want to visit Flint, I'll do it via videotape!
Bottom line: if you can't watch this film and laugh because deep down you know some of Moore's points are correct, you are probably too conservative. If you can't look outside of Moore's cloistered politics/economics and bring a little critique to the message of the film, you are probably too liberal.",1032220800,12,4309,4.604681404421326
346970,5,6301691687,"This hilarious, disturbing, and completely original documentary launched its director, Michael Moore to fame.  Moore's film shows what happens when General Motors decides to close down its plant in Flint, Michigan.  30,000 people lose their jobs and Flint's economy plunges into depression.
The film details Moore's attempt to get an interview with GM head Roger Smith to show him what he did to Flint.  Instead, Moore is given the run-around as he is informed that Smith is out, unavailable, or busy.
Undaunted, Moore points his camera at the people of Flint to show us the viewers what GM did to Flint.  We are shown a man who suffered a mental breakdown after losing his job.  We are shown a spaced-out woman who has formed a most interesting business to ward off unemployment.  We are treated to pictures of the upper class living in complete oblivion to the poverty surrounding them (""Get a job!"" one woman informs Moore).  We are informed that the crime rate has skyrocketed in Flint since the plant shut down.  But not to worry, this provides a new source of employment. Laid-off employees can now get jobs as security guards locking up their former co-workers.
A few scenes that really stood out in my mind:  One was the way the sheriff goes from house to house evicting people with a bored expression on his face.  When Moore questions him about how he feels about doing this, the sheriff looks completely baffled.  Instead, he talks about how he is looking forward to his upcoming holiday.  Doesn't he realize he's on camera?  Another scene that stands out, the people of Flint trying to offset unemployment by developing a theme park dedicated to celebrating Flint's GM heritage.  When the park fails to attract tourists, the people are left looking pretty stupid.
There's also that scene where Ronald Reagan shows up to treat the unemployed workers to pizza and give them a lecture about finding employment.  He then forgets to pick up the check.
It's important to realize that GM didn't close the plant in Flint because they were in an economic downturn, but because they didn't want to spend a little extra money keeping people employed.  GM devastated Flint's economy so that the people at the top could get a little richer.  Moore's film transcends being just a revenge comedy and becomes a stinging indictment of the dark side of capitalism.
You can't help but feel that Roger Smith would have been better off if he'd agreed to the interview.  Instead, Michael Moore chose to point his camera at Flint, giving Smith a much more damning indictment than an interview ever could.
I'll be looking forward to seeing Moore's new film ""Bowling for Columbine"" when it's released in October.  I hope its as good as this film.",1032220800,55,2733,4.8137044967880085

The film is a daring and cynical poke at a capitalistic system that, with smugness and phony piety, can turn out and lay off 30,000 factory workers for the sheer purpose of profit. But, rather than giving in to the easy way of anger and resentment, Michael Moore retorts with a gentle and entertaining masterpiece, a splendid statement, rich in irony, humor, and pathos, that should be viewed by anyone whose social conscience has been impinged by what so many people pursue as the ""American Dream"". But this American Dream is work hard, the company makes money - and you lose your job.

346973,5,6301691687,"If terrorists laid waste to an American city, we would universally call them evil. Strangely, when a corporation makes a decision that guts an american city, some who worship at the altar of unfettered capitalism would cheer. ""Roger & Me"" is a film that shows how a bottom-line based decision of a corporate CEO can turn a once vibrant industrial city into a ghost town.
It is an indignant film, as it should be. The victims of GM were not laid off because they were unproductive since GM was profitable. They were laid off because of greed. GM can no longer claim to be an American corporation when they would shut down an American city so they can have cheap labor off shore.
Some have said that Michael Moore was obnoxious and disrespectful, but it can be argued that what Roger Smith did was far more obnoxious and disrespectful.
Michael Moore uses humor to help viewers digest bitter realities of American life. In this case, the humor comes from the absurd advice given to laid off workers by city leaders and celebrities brought to ""bring them cheer."" The film is also heartbreaking and you will never listen to ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" by the Beach Boys the same way again. Some have criticized his intercutting the GM christmas party speech with a family getting kicked out of their homes on christmas eve as manipulative. Every day we are manipulated into believing that unfettered capitalism is American as apple pie, so we should forgive Moore for using manipulation on the behalf of the little guy -- the average joe.
I recently watched this movie again in a background of the Enron scandal. This movie was remarkably fresh after all these years. This film has a scrappy feel to it, but it is brilliantly put together.

346975,5,6301691687,"In 1988, Paul H. Weaver published ""The Suicidal Corporation"" about his days at the Ford Motor Corporation's public relations department.  Starting with a neo-conservative view, Paul saw that Ford did not practice free enterprise and often pursued suicidal strategies in the marketplace.
In 1990, Michael Moore came out with his film ""Roger and Me"" showing the same suicidal behavior at Ford's biggest competitor - General Motors.  The film lacks Weaver's economic insights, but makes up for it with the best dry humor ever in a documentary that has created its own genre.  The British, reknown worldwide for their dry humour, are eating up everything Moore is spitting out.
General Motors closed scores of profitable assembly and parts plants throughout the eighties, while keeping open unprofitable ones.  Moore's focus is on Flint, Michigan where GM's best cars were made - the Olds 88 and Buick LeSabre.  Moore is a Naderite, but never really analyzes why GM is closing down profitable operations.  So the viewer can only suspect that in the context of the increasing corporatism of the eighties and nineties, under the guise of free market rhetoric, that corporate machinations were designed to increase corporate power at the expense of other stake holders in the game.  Share holders, too, come across as a low priority in all of this.
In short, an hilarious and timeless film that will always pick one up no matter how blue one feels from his or her daily encounters with the absurdities of life.  I strongly recommend this film.",1017014400,8,1536,5.043478260869565

347018,3,6301691687,"Roger and Me is an intelligent and sarcastic documentary film about the lives effected by the General Motor's lay off in Flint, Michigan.  In this film, the director puts a sardonic, comedic twist on the decay of his hometown, which will leave you chuckling, disturbed and sick to your stomach.  This film focuses on corporate greed and the lack of corporate responsibility towards the American public.  While watching you can see how one CEO can change thousands of people's lives.  You might get a glimpse of General Motor's corporate strategy for gaining profit.  I observed how values and morals are excluded in corporate decision-making.  I saw money weighing more than human life.  Roger and Me shows us how Americans are taken advantage of by corporate greed.
 Are American-made automobiles still American if they are made in Mexico?  Or does an American remain true to the slogan ""Buy American"" if they purchase a General Motor's vehicle?  In 1986, General Motors closed eleven automotive plants to relocate to Mexico where labor costs are cheaper.  The population of Flint relied on General Motors for employment and a stable economy.  This action left the laid off workers impoverished, and the town of Flint in ruins.  Businesses closed and prisons opened converting proud union workers into convicts.  Unemployment spread like a plague.  So Michael Moore, the producer and director, had a mission to accomplish.  To find Roger Smith, the CEO of General Motors, and invite him to see the damage of what he had done.
 Michael Moore filmed dozens of Flint residents during his hunt for Roger Smith.  The seriousness of this film is masked with humor displaying the ridiculousness of everyone's situation.  It hooks the viewer into a fish bowl full of characters that are often victims of their own ignorance and denial.  The focus of this film is on General Motor's responsibility for the hardships of Flint, but it also comments on the lack of awareness and education of the residents.
 The director and crew frequently travel to the General Motors Headquarters in effort to speak with Roger Smith by sneaking on to a highly guarded elevator.  A security guard always catches each attempt and the crew is routinely escorted out of the building.  By avoiding the interview, Roger Smith is denying his involvement and responsibility for Flint's circumstances.  His silence and disinterest communicates his greed and selfishness.
Michael Moore is granted an interview with Tom Kay, a representative for General Motors.  Mr. Kay assures Michael Moore that the economy of Flint is still prosperous and opportunities remain available and diverse.  At the end of the film we find out that Tom Kay lost his job with General Motors.
 Michael Moore spends most of the film interviewing the natives of Flint.  Without the General Motor's Plants to employ the public, people are finding strange jobs to support themselves.  During filming, Michael Moore runs across a sign stating ""rabbits for sale, for pets or meat"".  As he walks past the local blood bank, men with track marks line up daily to give blood in exchange for cash.  Upon visiting the city jail, laid off General Motor's employees are either employed as jailers or caged as convicts.  Fred Ross, an officer responsible for the town's evictions, is seen throwing numerous people out of their homes.  The film takes us inside their houses as the residents are scurrying to pack up their belongings.  The streets of Flint are filled with abandoned, run down houses.
 The film randomly checks in with the executives of General Motors.  Various scenes witness the wealthy at cocktail celebrations, country clubs and an annual company Christmas Eve party.  The viewer is able to compare the circumstances of the employed General Motor's executives with the unemployed inhabitants of Flint.  At the end of the film, Roger Smith is recorded reciting a speech at his annual Christmas party.  His boorish words illustrate the positive reflections of his company and hopes for future prosperity.  There is no mention of Flint, Michigan.
At the Christmas party, Michael Moore is finally able to invite Roger Smith to witness a family being thrown out of their house on Christmas Eve.  Roger Smith refuses the invitation.
 Roger and Me made me question my freedom and worth as an American citizen.  Is the welfare of the American public ignored when corporate money is at stake?  Powerful corporations will continue to trade the value of human lives for profit if nothing changes.  The public has a responsibility to seek out the truth and hold corporations responsible for their actions.

It was one of the most heart-wrenchingly depressing movies I'd ever seen. When the Flint authorities announced that they were sinking their last few million into ""Auto World"" I almost burst into tears.

However, throughout both viewings, I kept thinking to myself, ""Yeah, it's sad that these people will be out of work, but what the hell does Moore want GM to do? Continue operating the Flint plant and hemorraging money, thus destroying not only the livelihoods of Flint residents, but also jeapordizing the lives of GM employees nationally?""

Michael Moore's Roger and Me is the tragic satire of the dismantling of the middle class, blue-collar community in Flint, Michigan.  This documentary focuses on the closing of the town's largest employer-General Motors-resulting in the loss of over 30,000 jobs and the destruction of Flint's economic culture.
The film is a litmus to the bitter realities of ""business gone bad""-or worse...gone bureaucratic.  GM was more than an industrial leader to its employees-it was the cornerstone of life in Flint-an industrial Mecca.  Employees believed in the vision of GM, lived the industry's values and devoted their careers to its existence.  Those who lost their jobs during the plant closing in the 1980s also lost self-identity, self-respect and integrity for their personal lives.
Terminated GM workers were forced to find any means to make a living:  Amway franchises, lint roller factory work, plasma donations, prison guards, Taco Bell line cooks (where most GM workers were terminated because ""line work was too fast and stressful"").  One woman morbidly resorts to selling rabbits for pets or meat.  As Money Magazine dubs Flint ""The Worst Place to Live in America,"" the film is threaded with daily evictions of families who cannot make rent, and the never-ending search for Roger Smith-Chairman of General Motors-as well as an overdue explanation of why GM disenchanted its employees.
From Pat Boone to the Hyatt to Miss America to Auto World, no one could save Flint from its demise.  According to a GM spokesperson,""GM has not promised and does not owe employees cradle-to-grave security.""  Ironically, its guiding principles state something completely different.",994291200,31,1900,5.367003367003367
347056,4,6301691687,"I thought this documentary was very insightful and interesting. The events in Flint were portrayed in a creative manner that made this movie different from other boring documentaries. Though I found Michael Moore to be rather annoying and immature, I do have to say that his film was well-thought out and put together. It was informative and gave an outsider of Flint an idea of how hard-hit the city was by the shut-down of the GM factories. It started off by giving a brief overview of the history of the city and its relationship with the GM company. People had worked there practically their whole lives. Generations of families had devoted themselves to the company. Flint flourished with the jobs that the factories offered. But one day, Roger Smith took that all away for apparently no reason. It was clear that GM wasn't losing any money by having factories in Flint. It was especially sad due to the fact that the GM company was born there! Roger Smith helped build up a city with aspirations and prosperity, and then tore it all down. Moore effectively compells the viewer to be overwraught with sympathy and pity for the people who were laid off with no idea what to do. I watched as Moore showed me a family being evicted from their home on Christmas Eve with no where to go. I saw a crazy lady sink as low as killing little bunnies to sell as meat. Flint was struck with panic as it fell from economic stability to wallowing in poverty. The place came close to being deserted. As the movie draws to a close, Moore left the viewer with a shot of a factory being torn down. It was the epitome of what had happened to Flint, and the feeling was depressing. I couldn't help but resent Roger Smith and what he had done to those poor people and the city that once was vibrant with life.",979603200,,1793,4.486238532110092

Flint,Michigan was home to GM motors until the president of GM motors, Roger Smith, decided to close down the company in Flint and reopen the company in a place like Mexico, where he could get away with paying the workers as little as possible. After the company is closed in Flint, the town goes to hell. The rat population grows higher than the human population in Flint and the crime rate becomes the highest in the United States. Families have their homes evicted on Christmas Eve and a woman sells rabbits as pets or meat to make a living. In one scene, Moore shows the woman killing a rabbit and skinning it for meat. It interviews a woman who seems to go insane because she mix up her colors (she is not an autumn she is a spring!) Micheal Moore shows his home town after the closing of the company in a serious but yet comical matter. He spends three years trying to meet Roger Smith, he goes to all his clubs and trys to get Roger Smith's reaction about people having their homes envicted on Christmas (What a present!). This film shows what kind of man Roger Smith is and how little he cares about the workers of Flint, Michigan.",979603200,12,1265,4.4334763948497855

Michael Moore, although he comes off as naive and childish at times, generally manages to paint poignant picture of Flint in its economic depression.  Moore travels across the country in search of the CEO of GM, Roger Smith, in hopes of persuading him to come back to Flint to see the effects f his greed.  Along the way, Moore witnesses the extremes of human nature - one woman stoops as low as to sell her rabbits as ""pets or meat.""  Although Moore doesn't succeed in bringing Smith to Flint, he does succeed in affecting his audience as he contrasts the luxury life of Roger Smith with the poverty in Flint.  The film is depressing to say the least but very much worth watching.",979603200,,863,4.61437908496732

The well known company of GM was born and created in Flint, Michigan. After many years of large profits, a GM chairman Roger Smith, decides to shut down the Flint company. As the last car went down the assembly line, people releized that their lives were changed for the worst. In about 3 years a wicked lot of Flint citizens were thrown out of their homes and moved away from Flint. At one point, the city was in such horrible slums, that the rat population was greater than the human population. This documentary at some points was extremely annoying, but funny so it was able to keep viewers interested. The movie shows how a great living area can turn into a horrible slum, just because of one company closing.

Mike Moore produced a quality piece of work when he produced this documentary. It does an excellent job portraying how the community is dealing with being abbandoned by GM, and Roger Smith. The communtiy has had its economy completely devastated by the company's move. Mr. Moore spends the entire movie chasing Roger Smith and trying to get answers about his decision. For most of the movie his attempts are thwarted until the very end. He gets to meet Roger Smith face to face, but his invitation to come to Flint is denied. During the movie the audience is compelled to feel sorry for the members of the Flint community. Mr. Moore shows everything from people being evicted from their home on Christmas to a live rabbit being killed and skinned.

347061,2,6301691687,I thought that Roger and Me had some very good points to make about American society. The fact that Roger Smith didn't mind laying off all those jobs is really sad. However while the message in this movie is very good I often found myself losing the point of the movie and just becoming anoyed with Michael Moore's rude and annoying attitude wich was prevalent throught out this whole movie.,979603200,5,391,4.6

The city deputy sheriff spends his day evicting people who can no longer pay their rent. Factories allover city shut down and people lose their jobs. Many turn to a life of violence, some try to get a new job at the local Taco Bell, or the lint roller factory. Flint, Michgan had become a city where families were renting U-Haul's and getting out as fast as you can. Michael Moore takes his small camera crew to clubs that Roger Smith belongs to, he goes in search of the man he believes ruined his hometown. He talks to people who used to work at the GM factories and what they do to get money. He talk to one woman who sells her rabbits as either pets or as meat, she butchers them herself in a very graphic segment in the film. The documentary shows the bad parts of the city.

When GMC in Flint, Michigan lays off thousands of workers, the city faces tragety.  The majority of city's residents are out of work; except of course the wealthly golfer ladies who can't be bothered with what is going on.  People are leaving their homes everyday because either they can not afford the rent and are being kicked out or they are moving to other cities to find work.  The condition of the city worsens; soon rats invade and one bizarre woman goes insane enough to raise rabbits and sell them for ""pets or meat"" in order to make money and survive.

His slightly biased view into the lives of the laid off workers was done in such a way that the viewer could only be dragged along into sympathy for the ruined lives.

Roger & Me was powerful and it really made me think about the bigger picture: the American economy and the idea of cheap labor.

The quest posed by the movie, in search of General Motors chairman Roger Smith, seems to represent a quest for answers, as to why people are put through these trials of poverty and hardships, when it seems god's power has been put down by large corporation.

He has quite a following, but I don't  know why we don't all ride his coat tails and help him make the points he  makes so well.  The man knows what's happening, and he knows what needs to  be done.  This movie tells the outrageous story of how corporate America is  raping the American people and leaving us half dead by the side of the  road.  He tells the story of his hometown, Flint, Michigan.

It is interesting to see how the rich  and the GM executives had no idea what was going on in the community of  Flint at the time.

My dad is employed by General as are several of my relatives. It was  interesting to see a movie about the city I live in.  I knew most of the  history already of course.  Its sad that all this has happened to Flint but  at the same time its not as bad as the movie makes it out to be. Flint is  not the greatest place, but anytime you take a place and show only the  negative aspects of it yeah it will look bad.  So this movie is a litle  bias.  Other than that it is very funny and I did enjoy it.  Currently  there are a lot more people from flint going to college, trade schools, or  getting some kind of training because they know they can't rely on getting  a job at GM anymore.  Also Flint is the home of University of Michigan,  Ketting University (top engineering college) and Mott Community college.

Flint is still a sizeable city (I'm pretty sure it's still one of the 5 largest cities in the state--I'd have to check), but probably a place few  people would choose to live.  As a Michigander, I'd say only Detroit has a  worse reputation, and Benton Harbor closely follows.  Flint most certainly  has movie theaters now, as I've driven by one on I-75, but not being a  resident, I don't know if that was the case when the movie was made.  I  suspect Moore was being sarcastic with his statement at the end of the  movie but can't say for sure...
There was a short (20 min) follow-up  piece called ""Pets or Meat"" that was shown with it when it aired  on local TV, but sadly that does not appear to be available on video.  Perhaps if they release it on DVD...",959040000,2,839,4.335483870967742

A total attack on greed and how this Roger Smith guy honestly cares more about money than  peoples' lives. It really shouldn't be rated R though (the only instances  of excessive swearing is when the poor family gets evicted (on Christmas  Eve, mind you!) the woman of the house shouts out the F word a few times  (right in front of little children, sadly). Everyone should see this movie.  It nearly made me weep. There is a scene where Moore is interviewing a lady  that slaughters rabbits, and I know the movie's rated R because I guess  Moore doesn't want little kids to be horribly traumatized by that scene.  Well, I'm eighteeen years old and the scene horribly traumatizes ME!  Because normally when you watch a movie you think ""Oh it's just a  movie, there's nobody that evil in real life."" but in this  documentary, it's real. Sad.
By the way there really should be a sequel  to this. I mean what's the rabbit lady doing now? And the deputy evictor?  Is Roger Smith still head of General Motors?
One more thing you won't  find is during the credits you won't see a disclaimer saying ""No  animals were harmed during the making of this film."" They were.

 I take the political views some people have labeled him with and look at his movies as common sense in your face.  He certainly has a unique way of showing Americans what's wrong in this country and why.  I was especially amazed at watching his movie ""who do we invade next"" which isn't about war, but about what we should be taking from the successes of other countries' .  It's a real eye opener.

But, similar to TV detective ""Columbo"" - he uses that disguise to cause the bad guys to dismiss him, without consideration of his potential skill, at their own peril. You see, in order to catch a bad guy (Corporate America, in this case), you need camouflage. Admit it, everybody takes their foot of the throttle, when they see a cop car with a rack, right? Even if they're not speeding. It's simply human nature. So the best way to hunt the speeders, is with an unmarked car. Wouldn't you agree? In his debut successful film, Michael Moore must resort to concealed 8mm cameras hidden in a briefcase. That's why the look of his films appear ""unprofessional"".
