950449,4,6305034478,"This movie has alot of great things going for it.  It has a great story, great acting, and the main reason I bought it was because of the amazing fight scenes.  This has got to rank up there as one of the best martial arts fantasy movies to date.  The only down side of this movie was two  things. One was the pasted on subtitles which you cant see if the picture  is really bright or white, and the end fight between the hero and villian is absurd.  What the heck was that!  Anyway besides that the movie is a classic  in the genre and worth purchasing.",955756800,3,554,4.11214953271028
950450,5,6305034478,"I saw this movie last month, and I can say without a doubt that this is the best. Kunfu action, romance, plot you name it its got it. This movie affected me so much. The action is so realistic and the story is just  incredible. Everyone has got to see this movie.",917481600,4,263,4.0576923076923075
950734,3,6305034478,"In my opinion, to say that this is one of the best martial arts movie of all time is an overstatement, but to say its one of the worst is hardly believable. The film was magnificently directed by Sammo Hung, an awesom martial artist himself with impeccable directing skills. He managed to make Andy Lau, Anita Mui (R.I.P.), and Maggie Cheung look like they actually know how to handle a sword. Now that's an accomplishment considering they're not all that great at martial arts,and there are several stunt doubles doing the more complicated moves. The story lies around an emperor who is running from his evil brother that is trying to kill him and permanently hold the throne. A village fisherman played by Andy Lau lends the emperor a hand and they become good friends. The emperor is on his way to retreive his supposed-to-be wife played by Anita Mui before she is killed by the brother. A complicated love story involving Andy, the emperor, Anita, and the emperor's bodyguard played by Maggie Cheung takes place. Interesting story indeed, but I have seen better films. The fights in this film are fast and well choreographed, and although there are some wirework present, its not too ridiculous. I enjoyed every fight in this film except the last one in the tomb...watch,its ridiculous. The film itself is pretty violent, but the fighters look so charismatic you sort of get distracted away from the blood. So the story is good as is the fighting and acting, so why only 3 stars? Well, I'd give the movie 4, but the DVD's sound is horrendous. The DTS track is a joke with sounds that just blast out of nowhere and it gets rather annoying. I dropped another star because the makers of the film really wanted the viewers to care about the characters, but during the whole film I didn't care very much at all. With all the mushy conversations, and there are many, it just wasn't enough to really praise this film. Plus I, along with several viewers, thought the inclusion of the killer whale was unnecessary. The scenes with the whale sort of ruined the film. To say that this film is better or close to the quality of Crouching Tiger is really going out on a limb. Crouching Tiger had wonderful cinematography, awesome action, a very good love story, and the characters were interesting. For an all round swordplay movie, Crouching was great, not the best, but great. Moon Warriors is ok, but not something to be praised so highly, and whoever did the sound on this DVD needs a new career. If you want the best version, pick up Moon Warriors from the Hong Kong Legends(HKL) distributors, but you'll need a regionless DVD player to play their region 2 DVDs. They're best for remastering video and audio elements of martial arts films. If you want to check out more swordplay films which I feel are better, then watch Crouching Tiger, Swordsman II (with jet li), Kill Bill (more action than story), and The Hunted (with Christopher Lambert). I know, you must be saying Christopher Lambert from Highlander????!! Take my word folks, this is his best film and the swordplay is awesome. Thanks for reading and check my other reviews for more martial arts recommendations.",1088726400,13,3167,4.72875226039783
950735,4,6305034478,"Moon Warriors is the story of a young fisherman named Phillip who befriends a deposed prince who is masquerading as a peasant. Through shared experiences, they begin to trust each other, and the prince entrusts the safety of his fiancee ""Moonie"" (yes, her real name), to Phillip's care. Phillip is sent to escort Moonie, and along the way he falls in love with her.
But the prince's evil baby brother (aren't they all?), is intent on killing the prince to become the one TRUE emperor. Can Phillip and his trained killer whale save the day?
I liked Moon Warriors (well, at least the first 3/4's of the film), but there was some definite cheesiness that must be mentioned,  In particular, the scenes where Phillip is riding the killer whale, and posing like a centerfold on its back...(Groan). And of course, some of the long drawn out fight scenes.
The good parts? Who can deny that the actor who played the prince, and Phillip were great hunks, and their friendship was cute. But the ending... What were they thinking? Completey unsatisfying. I had to deduct one star!
Overall, good film, but a really, really bad ending.",1067990400,6,1121,4.748717948717949
950736,5,6305034478,"Chinese Emperor is kicked off his throne by his evil brother.  While on the run from same, the Emperor and his bodyguard (which includes Maggie Cheung) is aided by Andy Lau.  While there is a dry spot in the middle of this film during which an entangled love affair is worked out, the film contains some (about 5 or six) very good fight scenes.  Maggie Cheung and whoever played the evil brother were both very good dramatically and the fight scenes were top notch.

950737,5,6305034478,"The Chinese Emperor has his throne usurped by a malicious brother
and while on the run from his murderous sibling is aided by peasant fisherman Andy Lau.  Complicating matters are a few romances between Andy Lau and the true emperors fiancee and the emperor with his bodyguard, played very well (as always) by Maggie Cheung.  This was an excellent martial arts movie.  Granted, there was a lull in the middle while the romance issures were worked out, but there were still at least six wonderfully choreagraphed fight scenes, especially the scene in the meadow with the kites where an attack by assasins is attempted using a clever Trojan Horse ploy.  The fights themselves are a good combination of ""wire kung fu"" and actual martial arts and all of these fights are of a decent duration. The evil brother (who's lethal with a naginata) is outstanding both as a fighter and as an actor, exuding a palpable maliciousness.  For those who didn't like this movie, possibly because of the dry spot in the middle.....well, I can only say, if you can't sit still without constant action, then perhaps you should go back to watching cartoons.  For anyone else who doesn't mind a human content (within the context of Hong Kong Cinema)  this is a good film to watch.  It certainly was better than Once Upon a Time in China, and while Moon Warriors might not be on anyone elses top ten list, it's still well above average.  The only real problem I had with this movie was that, as one other reviewer pointed out,  the subtitles were hard to read, but at least it wasn't dubbed.",1005696000,9,1566,4.661818181818182

Such perfect  corallation between actor and director , as evidenced clearly in the  resultant movie , to exist between Samo and Andy Lau , as well as Maggie  Cheung and Anita Mui , again , is seldom seen.

The great stunt work of the famed Hong Kong  ""Red Trousers"" adds even more to this movie. The story revolves around a simple fisherman and his reluctant involvement with two brothers and their struggle for power. Well written and fast paced throughout this film is a winner all the way. The standout cinematography by Arthur Wong is stunning. Lighting, color, tone, it is all good and was one of the great surprises of this film. In sum, it is beautifully photographed. Andy Lau's performance is top notch as is the work by Maggie Cheung and indeed the entire cast. The film even has a killer whale that carries some very nice scenes.

7880952,5,6305034478,"I am a huge Andy Lau fan!  I just discovered him a few months ago when I became aware of the excellence of Chinese cinema and music.  I have many Andy Lau movies, music videos and cd's.  Andy Lau can do absolutely everything and do them perfectly!  He can sing beautifully, dance like a professional dancer, play a killer, a romantic hero, a geeky guy, a feudal fighter, kung-fu master and swordsman.  He can ride a horse most impressively, make you laugh and cry with his superb acting talent and the list goes on and on.  In this movie, he rides a whale!  Yes, it's really him and he's really riding, swimming with and hugging a whale!  America has no one who comes anywhere close to being his equal when it comes to talent.  He's a genius in so many different areas.  I sometimes wonder if Chinese directors and movie moguls realize the extent of his greatness or, because he does everything with such ease, they just take his talent for granted?  This particular movie is a great adventure/love story.  I won't describe the plot, etc. because other reviewers have done that.  I just want to bring your attention to the multi-talent genius of Andy Lau.  Check out some of his other movies, and you will soon understand why I am such a huge fan.",1190851200,2,1247,4.484444444444445

7880955,2,6305034478,"What a disappointment this film was for me!

Let me say first that I have a terrific fondness for good martial arts films, and many of the Hong Kong films of the genre, while certainly showing and revelling in elements that are cheesy, yet succeed in being extremely entertaining. But this...!

I think it's fairly well understood that the Hong Kong martial arts film genre deliberately utilises many American westerns. It's not exactly unusual to see a tumbleweed go rolling across a deserted plain or through a deserted Chinese village, however silly that may seem. But in the case of this film, it went too far. My willingness to suspend disbelief and criticism came to a crashing halt. It began, I'm afraid, with the very opening scene. As soon as I heard the Chinesified western theme (borrowing heavily from the well-known musical theme that you'll recognise the instant you hear it), I flinched and said, ""Oh Lord, please let it improve.""

The film's score is just a mishmash of inappropriate melodies and songs. Featuring far too heavily are those frankly appalling songs sung with sugary sweetness by Chinese popstars who moo their way through lyrics of awful saccharine fake emotion. Chinese lyrics and poetry can be so delicate and powerful (exciting our admiration especially when they use miniature to create a sense of space), but the flip side is that they can also be horribly vulgar and overly sentimental. This film showed the flip side.

The story is predictable: displaced prince (Brother Yen) wants to regain his throne after travelling like a nomad through the land for years. His faithful follower, a beautiful Chinese girl, turns out to be hired by his evil brother (who usurped the throne), but switches sides yet again (after failing to kill the prince's betrothed) to fight for the prince in the final showdown. A young fisherman named Fei, with fabulous martial arts skills, defends the prince's party in a surprise ambush, and consequently bonds with the prince, falls in love with the prince's betrothed when he's sent to fetch her, and plays artlessly with a large dolphin called Wei. (There's a truly awful song at this point, by the way - it tries to be a lovely innocent ""love the environment"" song, but oh dear... oh no... it's one of those moments where one cringes and fast-forwards through the embarrassing music.)

Fei hides the prince's party in an underground tomb accessible only by a path which he knows (but that doesn't stop the evil usurper from finding it without difficulty) and also by sea. The final show-down reveals that: a) an evil usurper can generally fight off as many attackers as need be; b) rightful emperors (aka the prince) can be defeated by said pole-bearing evil usurper without difficulty; c) the girl who doesn't get the guy (aka the girl who joined the prince's forces in order to betray him but ended by loving him, even though his emotions were centred upon the daughter of his old friend General NanNing (I think that's the name)) is sure to be killed by the evil usurper, and to murmur, ""Even though I could not live for you, I am happy to die for you, my prince""; d) the general's daughter is of course torn between the prince and Fei, loving both of them, and of course she dies; and e) (this one's the killer) it takes a dolphin to kill an evil usurper. Yes, indeed - I joke not. The finale includes Wei surging through the river that leads to the cave in which the underground tomb is built, LEAPING out of the water to whack the evil usurper in mid-attack, and pulling down the entire tomb structure to kill everyone except Fei who finishes the film by looking at the flower-covered ground below which is the tomb, and making a philosophical comment that harks back to an earlier moment in the film.

The film's not all bad. The actors all look fine, and the swordplay is neither better nor worse than most of these types of film. I did become exasperated with some aspects of the fighting, because too much of it was dancing around attacking each other's weapons rather than each other - a big no-no in martial arts. ""Have at you, you foul sword of my enemy! Let me beat you, o most hideous polearm of my foe!""... There's a good idea for a spoof there.

The story is, again, neither better nor worse than many another film of this genre - except for the laughable ending.

The cinematography is only adequate, not wonderful. It certainly isn't a patch on some of the magnificent films in this style which have emerged just recently.

The insistence on having the terrible enemy be undefeatable is a peculiarity one often meets with in Chinese films of this sort. I confess I have never become accustomed to it. Why is the hero not able to defeat his evil foe? They are both mortal. They're both skilled. It's clearly a cultural element that is difficult for non-Chinese to understand.

But by far - BY FAR - the worst thing about this film is the soundtrack.

Comparing this film favourably to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""The Emperor and the Assassin"", ""House of Shining Daggers"" and ""Hero"" is unbelievable. The aforesaid films are not just nice-looking - they're gorgeous. The cinematography is superb. In most cases, the plots are good (in the case of ""Crouching Tiger"", the plot is superb and intricate). In each case for the films I've mentioned, the acting is magnificent and the fight scenes beautifully done. I'm afraid ""Moon Warriors"" will disappoint those who expect the same standard.

Recommended only for those who want to collect every film in this genre.",1149206400,2,5552,4.741968911917098
7880956,5,6305034478,"Moon Warriors is complete with a fast moving plot, interesting dialogue, good sound track of period chinese instrumental music, romance for the ladies and really fast action for the guys. You could put on this DVD just for the music.  Plus, there are four super stars in this movie including Maggie Cheung, the pretty girl in Hero.

Hero and, Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon can't even compare to this movie because people were moving around in their seats at the theater durring some scenes, (Boredom I guess).

I also highly recommend Green Snake, very erotic in good taste.",1108512000,7,578,4.877551020408164
