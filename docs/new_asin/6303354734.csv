627793,5,6303354734,This movie was an excellent beyond great love story. The movie was so endearing and touching that words can't even express how good it was. This movie is like one of those old African-American back in the day GHetto movies. I love movies like these. Plus JADA PINKETT is my most favorite Actress I love her to death Will Smith is a lucky man to have a woman with so much devotion and love. Jada's rolls in her movies have spunk and so much liveliness and that's what I love about her. I own this great classic movie on VHS and so can you. PEACE,985996800,,544,4.190476190476191
627794,5,6303354734,"When I saw this movie I thought how deep someone's love can go, from the 1st meeting, the chase to where Jason decided that he want to be with Lyric somewhere else, I still believe in true love and soulmate and they really  seem connected, I think they did a great job, some of the violence could've  been removed, but I love the movie and this is why I am ordering a copy for  my library.",951004800,2,389,4.092105263157895

628944,2,6303354734,"This was a movie I've been wanting to see since I was 11 years, so by the time I finally got a chance to see it, I was highly anticipating it. I liked it the first 4 times I saw it, but after the 5th time, I didn't like it as much. What changed? Well for one Allen Payne, who was convincingly in New Jack City, had an inconsistent performance as Jason. Sometimes he looked like an Oscar winning actor, other times he looked really amateur. His delivery of his lines at times was horrible and seemed really forced. Bokeem Woodbine as Joshua, had a much better performance than Payne. Woodbine's portrayal of Joshua is charismatic, intimidating, and compassionate. There were times you hated Joshua and other times, you ended up rooting for him. Woodbine's performance was one of the best in the film. Another excellent performance is Treach as Alonzo, the leader of a bank robbing crew. Alonzo is charismatic, menacing, volatile, and compassionate. Treach does an excellent job displaying all those emotions. At times, Alonzo is hatable, but by the end of the movie, you actually feel sorry for him. As great as Woodbine and Treach were, this movie goes downhill thanks to Jada Pinkett Smith. She didn't seem convincing as a romantic lead and an object of affection. Her delivery of her lines was off as well at times. I'm not saying I hate this movie. However it could have been better. I'm probably in the minority for what I think about this movie, but that's ok. For those of you who have never seen this movie, you might like it to the point where it will leave a lasting impression in your mind forever. But I see this as a movie that gets doomed by two inconsistent lead performances. Jason's Lyric being one of my favorite movies isn't a tune that I'll be singing!",1329350400,,1771,4.572327044025157

629010,4,6303354734,Jason's Lyric is clearly one of the best urban love stories ever put on film. The direction by Doug McHerny showed real talent as did his screenpaly. Allen Payne and Jada Pinkett both showed early lead acting roles in this good film. Finally I think Forrest Whitaker and Bokeem Woodbine both deserved Oscar nods for their work. I give it **** out of ****.,1221955200,,355,4.5625
629011,5,6303354734,This movie is my definition of a good romance film.  It's simply about a good man's romantic chase going after a good woman and the fact that nothing can separate their love in the end.  I especially liked it showing the romance in a modern Black perspective.  Excellent directing and excellent acting.  Always loved Allen Payne and Bokeem Woodbine.  Seen them in a couple of other films or TV shows where they showed their good acting skills.  Jada Pinkett-Smith is of course top of the line.,1203120000,,493,4.674418604651163
629012,5,6303354734,"I remember being in high school (Da Ridge...Eagles baby!) when this movie came out in 1994. I remember thinking how cool that a movie like this would be filmed in my own city versus LA or NY. Many of the scenes in the movie were filmed in the most popular areas, especially those known as hot tourist locations. The movie depicts life in the roughest parts of town and how it can harden a person including families. But the two lovers in this movie dream about and desperately want a better life for themselves, therefore they take their destiny into their own hands in this courageous movie. Ya gotta' get this DVD and the soundtrack too...I love them both!

Jason's Lyric, just one of many movies to put H-town on the map! The restaurant that Jada Smith works at is called ""This Is It"". Definitely one of the best soul food restaurants in Houston...check it out next time you're in town.",1173484800,,889,4.521739130434782

629080,5,6303354734,"As I watched the DVD, I did seeking for an answer to something that this movie had stirred in me.  To my amazement it surfaced in me that this movie centered around pure, innocent, mind probing, and heart phased LOVE.  In other words, UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.  Yet even though it appread in an ordinary way it was demonstrated in an extraordinary style.  Jason, having to face the lost of his father by his own hands, had to come to terms with the fact that he killed his father but not for evil but to protect his mother. In all respect, JASON wanted to be the GOOD SON.  Not hurting but helping. As a result, he had to choose between the woman he loved and the brother he wanted to protect.  This woman, whom he had only known for a very short time but yet they had shared something so intimate and so soul connecting,  that he found himself locked in something so deep that he could not give up; even at the cost of his brother. Even after all of the disappointments, he still came to the conclusion that this woman was the key for him.  She was not perfect but she held his attention, which later led to her holding his heart.  Even in the intimate scenes, I did not get offended but yet, I saw a man, who needed to know he was approved being certified in the arms a woman. He needed to know that even though he had committed a bad act (killing his father), that he was still a good person.  This woman helped him to embrace that and strengthen him to a level where he could move foward and reach for GOD'S BEST.  I titled my review HONEYCOMB because as bitter as the events in Jason's life was God sent him a sweet taste of victory (Lyric).

629081,3,6303354734,"Jason's Lyric, a story about an astute poet who exaggurates about leaving the 'Ghetto Hood' of Los Angeles, CA finds it worth while when meeting a troubled individual with a shocking past. The two fall in love but first must overcome obstacles in their own lives. Jada Pinkett and Allen Payne provide decent preformance and make the movie worthy of watching and understanding the story. Unlike the stupidity of the storytellers basing a movie in the deprived areas of America, this movie shows the obvious human side to the characters and gets you attached to them even more.

Although the ending of the movie was an enigma in itself, the story was adequate in most areas and tied the lives of the characters together to bring one of the passable plots of the 90s.",1124755200,4,764,4.701492537313433

629170,5,6303354734,"Jason's Lyric is a true love story. In the midst of so much blight this film shows you that you don't need to have a Monster's Ball to know that love is courage and that there is hope in the bleakest of situations.
Allen Payne and Jada Pinkett give the best performances of their careers in this story of a man coming to terms with his troubled past while trying to help his brother (Bookeem Woodbine) who has just got out of prison. One day at work he finds his true love Lyric (Jada Pinkett) who wants to help him achieve his dream of a better life. He gets several chances, but is forced to turn them down because of his obligation to his brother. In a climatic conflict with his brother, Jason stops being his brother's keeper and resolves his personal issues. Jason achieves his dream and moves on with Lyric.
The script is well written; characters are well defined and have more dimensions than shown on the surface. The choices they make in their to change lives feel natural and not forced. Allen Payne makes you feel Jason's pain while Jada Pinkett shows us Lyric's love and compassion. Both Payne and Pinkett deserve better than what Hollywood has offered them currently, when given quality material they shine. Bokeem Woodbine makes you feel sorry for Jason's brother; you hate what he does, not him. Other noteworthy performances include Suzanne Douglas and Forrest Whitaker as Jason's Parents, and the two child actors who play young Jason and his brother. The production values are top notch on this film; I don't know why critics roasted this movie. It is very well done and should have been nominated for some Oscars.
This film has quite a few steamy love scenes; this film is not for kids. However, adults will find this to be a powerful and moving story full of hope character and courage.",1087430400,9,1807,4.614906832298137

629172,4,6303354734,"Shakespearean/Freudian overtones coupled with a dynamic love story make ""Jason's Lyrics"" one of the premier films of the 90's.  The acting of Allen Payne and Jada Pinkett as the title's stars, ""Jason and Lyric, respectively), along with Bokeem Woodbine (""Joshua""), Suzanne Douglass (Jason's mother), and the brilliant Forest Whitaker (""Maddog"")is flawless.  One feels for all the characters as the tragedy of their lives unfolds on screen.
Credit must also be given to Eddie Griffin and Lisa Nicole Carson.  The former adds a little humor to an otherwise starkly grim and realistic story while the latter serves as Lyric's ""muse"".
Also, the casting of the actors Sean Hutchinson and Burleigh Moore that played younger versions of Payne and Woodbine is commendable.  Besides being extremely talented, they LOOK the part.
As others have commented, the ""acting"" during the intimate scenes  makes this film definitely for the adult.",1050364800,20,928,5.372413793103449

Jason and Joshua--brothers. Dealing with a traumatic past that haunts them. The secrets revealed in the end were deep and clarified much of Joshua's anger. He was such an angry boy.
Lyric, another victim of circumstance was Jason's escape. Her name nearly said it all. Though it was her friend how quoted poetry it was Lyric who brought the words to life with her feelings for Jason.
The movie as a whole EARNED it's R rating, unfortunately, and I can't say I recommend it for young teens--it does have it's graphic sexual scenes and violence.

But its a film for adults only they cut some scenes out of the movie to avoid a NC-17 rating. But even with the scenes they cut it still should have got the NC-17 rating. The love scenes in the movie are still very graphic. I have seen NC-17 rated movies and the sex in those films are not even close to the sex in the R rated Jason's Lyric. So I don't know what the Mpaa is doing but there giving the wrong movie NC-17 and giveing the ones that should an R rating.

Payne's ne're-do-well brother, Joshua {Woodbine} plays the hard-headed prison thug who struggles to stay on the right path.  Payne is also plagued by nighmares he suffers as a result of a struggle between his parents that ended up in tragedy.  In effort to get away from all the drama and the nonsense, he and Lyric plan to just go far away and leave everyone -and everything- behind.  Everytime I watch this movie, I cry.
