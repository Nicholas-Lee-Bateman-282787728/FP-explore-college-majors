Think of it as an animated version of ""Friends"" - except it takes place at the local mall.  It's called ""6teen"" 'cause it centers around - what else ? - six teenagers: Jen - the responsible one, Jonesy - the smooth operator, Wyatt - the cool-headed musician, Nikki - the tomboy, Caitlin - the sweet girl, and Jude - the dude.  This DVD has the first 3 episodes:

""Take This Job and Squeeze It"" - Our team of teens attempt to get their first summer jobs at the mall - including Caitlin, who just got her credit card revoked.

""The Big Sickie"" - The gang decides to spend a day at the mall's amusement park, but Jen refuses to participate.

""A Lime to Party"" - The competition gets a little juicy as Caitlin's ""Big Squeeze"" stand goes up against Jonesy's ""Party Lime"".  Meanwhile, Nikki and Jude try to win Wyatt over because he has two concert tickets.

Also, as strange as it is for a special feature, it's got three Ronald McDonald promos for some reason.  No matter, the songs in those promos are rather catchy.

But I must admit, next to ""Total Drama Island/Action/World Tour"", this is a pretty good series and I've grown attached to it up until the epic two-part finale episode.  It's got heart, humor, and a rather interesting look a typical teenager's life.  And best of all - if I may borrow a term used in this show - it doesn't suck !

Keep watching Cartoon Network for more about this series and look out for more new episodes on this as well as ""Total Drama"" and ""Stoked"".",1280707200,3,1585,4.442906574394463
8271356,5,B000KEJB7Y,"Having never bought from a seller before I didn't know what to expect. I soon learn that while some sellers let you know what their DVD ships others don't and unlike normal Amazon orders you don't seem to be able track seller purchases as easy.  The sellers merchandise however are normally in perfect quality and 6 Teen is one of the best products sold only in Canada that worth trying to get from Amazon. The story is about five kids who been friends since Pre-K looking for part time summer jobs at a mall with over 900 stores to pick from. At the same time spoiled rich girl Caitlin max out her dad credit card and like Jonesy, Niki, Jude, Jen and Wyatt, she is forced to get a job to learn the value of money as well as learn the meaning of true friendship with her five new friends over her rich false friends.",1230422400,,816,4.264516129032258
