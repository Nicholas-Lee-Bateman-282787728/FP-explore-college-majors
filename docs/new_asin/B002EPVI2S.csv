8368158,5,B002EPVI2S,best show Alton ever did. A classic to watch year after year!,1482105600,,61,4.166666666666667
8368159,5,B002EPVI2S,"The first one got lost in transit, but after receiving it the second time around, it was really a good show!",1448236800,,108,4.190476190476191
8368160,5,B002EPVI2S,"I love ""Good Eats"" and find Alton Brown endlessly fascinating and entertaining in his approach to cooking. ""Holiday Treats"" is one of the more thematically shoehorned DVDs in the series, as it does deal with foods cooked frequently on holidays, but is unevenly weighted towards turkey with both ""Romancing the Bird"" and ""Behind the Bird"" devoted to the fowl. The third show, ""It's a Wonderful Cake"" is a tribute to fruitcake. I am not a fan of ordinary fruitcake, but after seeing Alton make it right, I am a convert.

All of these episodes are winners, but I have to single out ""Behind the Bird"" with its public access cable TV meets ""Blair Witch Project"" Thanksgiving leftover apocalypse ethos for originality. Mercifully no zombies appeared, and the sole kidnapping was resolved peacefully. Now that's Thanksgiving ""Good Eats"" style!",1445644800,2,836,5.057971014492754

8368163,5,B002EPVI2S,"Never disappointed by Alton Brown - funny, smart, and not good looking enough to distract from the food.  Wonder if he'll send me a bunch of freebies when he sees this?!?!?",1351641600,5,172,4.548387096774194
