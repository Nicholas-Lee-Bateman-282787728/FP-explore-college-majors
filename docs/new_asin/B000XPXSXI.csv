8325909,4,B000XPXSXI,A dreamlike reminiscence of a long ago dinner shared by H.L. Mencken and Rudolph Valentino. Well cast and elegantly filmed at the Oviatt building in Los Angeles the film seems to capture the actual evening where two very different 1920s stars crossed paths. The only flaw is the ill-fitting and incorrectly accessorized evening clothes worn by the actor playing Valentino. Odd because every other detail seems perfect.
