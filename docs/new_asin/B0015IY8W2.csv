8258750,4,B0015IY8W2,"Scraping into four star territory for what it is, this DVD came free with UK Metal Hammer magazine issue 157 (September 2006) so whatever you do, don't pay too much for it given the person you are buying it off quite probably got it for free  especially if they are a vendor in the UK.

Anyway, the editorial review has the tracklisting for this product and so that is perhaps the best guide as to whether you should part with your hard earned or not. The menu screen is easily used, the quality of the thing seems fine and I had no trouble playing it on my home DVD player despite not being in the UK region, so while it doesn't say so I'm am guessing that there is no region code on this thing. Just don't let loose the hounds of war at me if I'm wrong OK!!!

And that's pretty much all the points that need telling regarding this product....",1267833600,,844,4.197530864197531
