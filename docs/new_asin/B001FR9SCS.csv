8302438,4,B001FR9SCS,"When I heard that a film biography of Camarn was being made, with the cooperation of his widow La Chispa, I was intrigued: how could any actor hope to sing like Camarn and not be laughed at? And any such biography must necessarily include Paco de Luca, and probably Tomatito as well: how could any actor play either of these unless he could also play guitar like them? And if he could play like that, what would he be doing acting?

To these questions I now know the answers.

Camarn's original recordings are used, with the actor (Oscar Jaenada) lip-synching (or miming, as it used to be called). The actors playing Luca and Tomatito likewise mime; and they must both be at least competent guitarists, for not only do they look as if they're really playing, they look to my not-inexperienced eye as if they're actually playing the music in question. This alone places ""Camarn"" ahead of 99% of comparable Hollywood movies.

Any film of course requires a certain suspension of disbelief: you know that Keith Michell is not REALLY&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-VIII/dp/B000EBD9VM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry VIII</a>, or whoever. But a portrayal of someone the viewers are familiar with, and have already seen repeatedly on TV, video or in person, places an even greater strain upon credulity, and so must be correspondingly more convincing.

I thought that Oscar Jaenada, and the film in general, acquitted themselves well in this respect; I found ""Camarn"" enjoyable, and if you're a Flamenco aficionado, the chances are you will too.
