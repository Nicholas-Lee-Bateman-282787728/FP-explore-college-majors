We both  know the identity of the serial killer but we can't escape his fascination, like a rabbit cannot escape a rattlekesnake. But at the enigmatic end of the movie you discover that you got everything wrong, the name of the real serial killer is AIDS and the inspiration of the director is probably a book by John Rechy called Numbers, about promiscuity and anonymous sex. This film is a landmark and you MUST buy it and see it.",1392076800,3,734,4.553030303030303

It's an all-male cast, and they're nearly always naked - REALLY naked, not the coy, fig-leaf male nakedness 99% of American movies (even the gay movies) dole out as if it were toxic (in contrast to female nakedness, which they shove in our faces all day long). The only problem here is the shaved pubic hair, which is a HUGE turn-off.

I thought the creepy, shaved-pubes look was restricted to gay-for-pay porn stars and West Hollywood gym bunnies, so it makes me really sad to see it even in rural France where this movie is set. The creepy hairless epidemic must be sweeping the whole civilized world. They say circumcision is a crime and then they shave off the pubes! It's crazy.

ANYWAY, there's lots of dick, and lots of sex in this movie, and it's not always simulated. Some will call this porn, but it's not. Some will call it a thriller, but anybody expecting white knuckles will be badly disappointed.

There's a murderer, but there are no big shocks, no frantic chases, nothing out of Hollywood's bag of stock thriller tricks. The movie is as languid and easy as the warm summer days it depicts (but sometimes it does get a little scary in the woods after dark!)

There are no sets, no special effects, and not one note of music. The whole movie takes place outdoors, in and around a beautiful man-made lake (lac de Sainte-Croix) in the foothills of the Alps, on a remote beach where gay guys go to swim, sun their shaved pubes and cruise the wildlife.

Besides all the sex, there's a nice friendship between the main character and an oddball straight man who hangs out there for his own, totally harmless reasons. And there's some really funny dialog about giant catfish that may or may not live in the lake.

Pierre Deladonchamps is fantastic as Franck, the main character, as is Patrick d'Assumao as Henri the straight guy. Christophe Paou is good as the subtly sinister murderer Michel - and he is identified early, so I'm not spoiling the story for anybody who hates spoilers.

I think I can safely say this is unlike any movie anybody has ever seen before. I liked it a lot.

NOTE: I am reviewing the 2-disc set listed here on Amazon.com as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-inconnu-du-lac-Edition-collector-2-DVD/dp/B00E8WL48S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L'inconnu du lac - Edition collector 2 DVD</a>, although I ordered it from Amazon.fr because it was a lot cheaper even with overseas shipping. Since I am not fluent in French and this DVD set has no English subtitles, I used English subtitles readily available online. My French is good enough that I could tell the subtitles I was using were good; however, I cannot comment on any of the extra features on this 2-disc set. Hopefully there will be an official release with English subtitles soon. This movie deserves wide release in the English-speaking world.",1388188800,13,3114,4.882575757575758
