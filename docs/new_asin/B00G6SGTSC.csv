8621151,5,B00G6SGTSC,"This 4 part series asks and answers the most important questions surrounding the assassination of JFK. Eyewitness testimony, ballistic and autopsy evidence, and questions for and answers to conspiracy theorists and their attempts to discredit the WC report are dealt with without sanctimony and hyperbole. A very clear convincing presentation of the events and the guilt of L.H. Oswald.",1393200000,3,386,5.559322033898305
8621152,5,B00G6SGTSC,"I was fortunate to buy this when the price was temporarily lowered to $19.99 in November 2013, and am sure the current price of $39.99 for one disc is going to discourage people from buying it. That's too bad, because whatever your view of the Warren Report is, this disc of four one-hour broadcasts of CBS Television's examination of the Warren Report and its conclusions is fascinating.

There is film here that will interest most amateur historians or assassination buffs. Different camera views looking out from the 6th floor window of the Book Depository, plus views of the interior, and other street views and angles give a broader perspective of what we've seen in other films of the assassination and its aftermath.

It's great to once again see Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather, Mike Wallace and others at work on this series of four programs. Also listening to the eyewitnesses interviewed by CBS News for this broadcast is very interesting. Others interviewed include Mark Lane, Jim Garrison and Edward Jay Epstein.

I vaguely remember watching these broadcasts in late June 1967 when I was young, and to me, seeing this again now after all these years while knowing more about the history of the assassination is like restoring a valuable missing part of historical and cultural history.  It's fascinating.  If you grew up in the 1960s and remember what it was like to live in America during that decade of many changes, despite the high cost of this DVD I think you would enjoy it.

Only one small criticism about the video transfers - someone superimposed the CBS ""eye"" logo in the lower right of the screen which remains on the programs for the entire running time. That wasn't on there when these broadcasts were made in 1967, television stations did not have logos on screen during their broadcasts in the 1960s.  It's a small area on the screen and generally isn't noticeable, but it shouldn't be on here at all, you have to wonder what the company is thinking when they feel they need to push their logo at you for the entire running time of a program after you have bought their product and expect it to be logo-free.  However, I have no complaints about the content of the programs otherwise.",1389139200,3,2208,4.761780104712042

8621154,5,B00G6SGTSC,"As I work at CBS (and am one of the people responsible for this title being offered) my 5 Star review is biased. Nevertheless, as this title has just now being offered (and it is probably too soon to expect reviews prior to the glare of publicity surrounding the anniversary of the Kennedy assassination), I want to share with you...verbatim... a story from the New York Times in 1992 about why these shows are important:

Editorial Notebook; Television's Memory Hole
By KARL E. MEYER
Published: July 01, 1992

Television, for all its awesome reach, has an ephemeral touch. Even the best programs rarely leave footprints in libraries, archives, indexes or books. It is harder to retrieve the transcript of a documentary seen by millions than to unearth an obscure magazine article read by thousands.

Who remembers, for example, an ambitious four-part CBS documentary called ""The Warren Report,"" broadcast just 25 years ago? It was apparently overlooked by the American Medical Association, which claimed in May that two pathologists, Dr. James J. Humes and Dr. J. Thornton Boswell, had broken a 28-year silence to discuss their autopsy on President Kennedy.

In truth, Dr. Humes had offered essentially the same defense of the Warren Commission's forensic findings when he was interviewed by CBS 25 years ago. I only learned of this during a chance encounter with Leslie Midgley, the program's executive producer, who has been following with bemused detachment the uproar over Oliver Stone's recent film, ""J.F.K.""

The documentary yields other surprises. Take the famous photograph of a grinning Lee Harvey Oswald holding his rifle. The picture's authenticity has been widely questioned, most recently in ""J.F.K."" The shadows cast by his face and body don't match, prompting charges that Oswald's head was superimposed on someone else's body.

In 1967 the network had Lawrence Schiller, a professional photographer, recreate the picture at the same address, 214 Neeley Street, on the same date in March, using a model. A straight nose shadow corresponded with an angular body shadow, just as in the disputed picture.

Mr. Midgley's team had another excellent idea, to test the assertion that one man could not possibly have fired three shots within 4.8 to 7 seconds, as the Warren Report concluded. The team built a tower and target track to match the distances in Dealey Plaza. Eleven volunteer marksmen, most of them unfamiliar with Oswald's Italian Mannlicher-Carcano, took turns firing three shots at a moving target. A weapons engineer made three hits in 5.2 seconds; a state trooper made two hits and one near miss in less than 5 seconds. The average firing time was 5.6 seconds.

The larger point here is that television made an honorable effort to answer nagging questions 25 years ago in a program that, like much good TV journalism, sadly vanished into a memory hole. All the familiar arguments were ventilated: the flaws in the Warren Report, Jim Garrison's conspiracy thesis, the conflicting accounts of eye witnesses, police, the F.B.I. and the C.I.A.

Walter Cronkite's prefatory words took note of a growing stream of books, articles and even a film that challenged the Warren Report. Eric Sevareid's comments would seem equally topical today. Few, he said, could believe that a ""single, weak-chinned little character"" could have caused so much havoc.

Excerpts of this CBS News Inquiry have been rebroadcast, but the original has never been reshown in its entirety. Indeed, it took an intensive search by the network to locate a transcript. One remedy would be to reissue the program on videocassettes, and thus remind a new generation of a serious effort to address their parents' doubts about Dallas.",1384300800,20,3719,5.142384105960265
