8421938,5,B004BF0DF2,"very great film. I just loved the film and it's a beautiful story of child marriage. In ancient times in India there was a time when child get marry and then when the time comes they live together. This film surely tells the story of that marriage and tells it greatly. The acting by Sachin, Rajni Sharma, Asrani, Kajri are brilliant and Asrani and Kajri had won the supporting film-fare. But I think Rajni did deserve an award but didn't got any. The direction is amazing and the sets are great. Costumes are beautiful and photography is brilliant. Rajni as Chini looks so beautiful that you will fall in love with. Sachin a gochu looks great and you can fall in love with him in this film also. I never knew that he could act so brilliant because I have seen him in other rolls along with stars but think that he is just a extra actor but he is brilliant in this film. The film is worth watching. It's very gullible cute film.",1302566400,,928,4.339080459770115
