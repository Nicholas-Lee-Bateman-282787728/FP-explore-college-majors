8515296,1,B001E83MNO,"Chuck Spezzano, Psychology of Vision (container title: Inspiring Heart, Mind and Soul). This was filmed July 23, 2007 in St. James Church, Piccadilly, London.

This DVD is 90 minutes of Spezzano performing his act to an audience of people who appear to be new to Spezzano and Associates Psychology of Vision. I did not recognize any of the familiar faces. So we are seeing the ""gateway"" Spezzano here.

Most of the performance is pretty routine for Spezzano-watchers. All problems boil down to guilt, all solutions boil down to love. He used a First Nations rape victim as his blame-the-victim example. Incredibly insensitive and destructive. The word ""justice"" is not in the SALPOV vocabulary. I should think activists involved with the movement to stop violence against women would be outraged at the assertions of Chuck Spezzano.

Spezzano exhibited the crude and obscene jokes he is famous for, in a CHURCH, to an English audience of strangers. It didn't go over too well. He kept having to tell the viewers it was OK to laugh. In short, he sort of died.

Toward the end is where the fun starts. Spezzano tells the assembled crowd he is going to perform a ""Oneness Blessing,"" and he adds, ""It's just an energy transfer, it's called a Deeksha Blessing.""

He does this without pontificating further or defining what it means. New Age type music begins and lights go dim when Chuck directs the stage crew. Then as the music plays, which is never identified but appears to be from India, Chuck stands in front with his hands raised, imitating one of his ""greatest inspirations,"" Amma and Bhagavan from Oneness University.

I figure this DVD was made shortly after Spezzano was finished with his enthusiastic participation in classes at Oneness University. As we can see, OU had an enormous impact on shaping the current curriculum of Spezzano's for-profit Psychology of Vision. Lency Spezzano has since denounced Oneness University.

If you like watching a New Age medicine show at work, this is the DVD for you.",1449878400,,2012,4.93491124260355
