8740634,5,B017TJXMZ4,"VISIONS OF DEATH is a nice little Made-For-TV thriller that was broadcast back on CBS-TV in the Fall of 1972.

With great performances by the three leads and a cool Morton Stevens (""Hawaii Five-O"") musical score, VISIONS OF DEATH is a welcome DVD edition to anyone who loves those old 70s ""Movies Of The Week"" - Rating: Five Stars!!!",1456358400,,333,4.6440677966101696
