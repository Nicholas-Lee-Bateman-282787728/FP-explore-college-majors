7945611,5,B00005MKKE,"I love historical documentaries. I majored in History, yet learned nothing, so I get a lot of use out of historical documentaries. One of the things I enjoy the most about them is how you don't really have to look at them, they are great to not look at but listen to. The subject of this one was Rome and Pompeii, the information was concise and informative.",1377129600,,358,4.358208955223881
7945612,1,B00005MKKE,"Extremely boring, horrible annoying narration, reenactments taken from silent movies &, thus, laughable. Couldn't finish watching about Rome & made a frisbee out of this DVD... Too bad: I had high hopes for these programs, thought it would be educational for my daughter, but, alas...",1368489600,3,284,5.333333333333333

7945614,5,B00005MKKE,"This was a definate WOW... The Ancient cultures come alive with this very clear presentation.  The narrator has a pleasant voice and is very personable and easy to listen to.  The major cultural centers of Ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome are revealed.  This is done with movie footage of main buildings, inside and out, as their customs and habits are discussed.  Some interesting hollywood movie film footage is also used to show the dress, manner and settings.  An ancient building, like the Greek Parthenon, is viewed as it is today, and then a computer graphic of how it looked at the time it was built is overlayed.  I found this to be really facinating.  And they did these kind of design impressions dozens of times, including the colors that were originally used in the building art. Each ancient culture is addressed with a two hour presentation, with as much information as one can absorb in one sitting.  And they also include bonus films with hour long presentations of: Travel to Egypt, Atlantis, and the Early Church in Rome.  I am really happy with this inspirational set!",1301097600,7,1086,4.795698924731183
