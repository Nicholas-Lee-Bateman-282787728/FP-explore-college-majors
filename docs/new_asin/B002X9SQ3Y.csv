8383540,5,B002X9SQ3Y,"I have long been a fan of the Santos movies although conceding they are pretty dreadful.  They take me back to the Sunday afternoons in Southern California watching a show hosted by someone named Seymore (no kidding).  He would usually start the show with an admonition to change the channel and periodically if he deemed a movie to be worse than dreadful, he'd replace it with another in mid reel.  Santos movies fit perfectly in there.",1436140800,,437,4.723684210526316
8383541,5,B002X9SQ3Y,"Love, love, love Santo this is a great intro to the genre.",1425081600,,58,3.9166666666666665

8383543,5,B002X9SQ3Y,"This is a review of the Cinematogrfica Rodrguez Region 1&4 DVD. It played in my region 1 player just fine, and it's a nice-looking transfer. There are, indeed, English and French subtitles; the English subs are good, but I can't vouch for the French. I do want to point out that the running time is 80 minutes, not 95 as the Amazon description claims. No exciting extra footage here!

As for the movie itself: It's got Santo and zombies. It's awesome!",1406160000,5,451,4.567901234567901
8383544,5,B002X9SQ3Y,"""Santo Contra los Zombies"" has everything you've come to expect in a quality Santo film: two wrestling matches, a belly-dancer, a laboratory full of beakers and flasks that fly to flinders when Santo gets ahold of them, Lorena Velazquez running around in the woods in 1962 high heels with pointed toes, and lots of cars from the 1950s! Santo and the detectives never drive the same car twice, but the zombies always drive a 1951 Chevy station wagon. Santo gets the best cars: a 1954 Corvette and a 1956 Thunderbird. Lorena Velazquez gets the newest car: a 1957 Ford Fairlane. And best of all, it's got no kissy mush; Santo just leaves at the end of the movie.",1351123200,9,659,4.593220338983051
