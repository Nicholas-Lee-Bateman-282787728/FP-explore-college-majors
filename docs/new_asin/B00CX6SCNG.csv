5750661,1,B00CX6SCNG,"i did not like it these Fanatic ladies , Wear your kundalini from inside out not like a ornament for people to see",1397520000,3,114,4.0
5750662,5,B00CX6SCNG,"I can't rate this instructional dvd --and anything by Gumkh--highly enough. this is my first intro to Kundalini and its therapeutic values for people with anxiety, depression, or low energy (I am recovering from chemo) is astonishing to me. I suspect that it would be excellent to use with hyper active or ADD children.  The exercises emphasize deep breath work, and movements that focus on the spine-- a lot of wonderful twisting. They also foster the image and feeling of flying--there are several exercises where one spins and spins one's arms. Finally though i might be confusing this with another dvd of hers--there is an exercise where you roll back and forth and are made to recall rolling down-slope as a child.
this un-sticks from frozen patterns of emotions like nothing else. I love yoga and dance--but there is an astonishing simplicity and rigor to this that seems to draw on centuries of basic wisdoms about breath and body movement.",1393027200,22,947,4.91875
5750663,5,B00CX6SCNG,"I have just discovered kundalini, it really is amazingly effective at helping you feel more relaxed, more energized, and more loving (although it looks pretty silly when you are doing it). Gurmukh is excellent, I have all her videos. This one is very powerful, I don't do it often but when I do I feel changed deep within. This is not a get toned yoga workout, this is a heal your life experience. Dive in and feel the bliss!",1378684800,32,425,4.3924050632911396
5750664,5,B00CX6SCNG,"I got this a few days ago and tried it for the first time today. The chapters are broken down as follows:

1. Introduction
2. Ong Namo - Tuning In
3. Circling Arm Extensions
4. Crisscrossed Arm Extensions
5. Reverse Shock System
6. Moving Mudra with Eye Focus
7. Heart Center Arm Stretch
8. Ball of Energy
9. Interlocked Arm Spiral Grind
10. Gong Meditation
11. One Minute Breath
12. Stretch and Tighten
13. Long Time Sun

The whole routine is recorded at Sat Nam Fest and includes scenes of the audience, Snatam, Gurmukh and the musicians. The whole hour is practiced sitting down and there are extensive arm movements for chapters 3-9 + 12. I had a difficult time finishing a few of these and other people in the audience could also been seen putting their arms down, it is tough, some of the exercises go on for a while and it's difficult to believe that holding your arms up in the air doing small movements could feel so hard. You will feel it in your shoulder blades and arms for sure but it doesn't do much for your legs.

I have to say I was having a very difficult week emotionally this week, so I figured this would be a good one for me today. Snatam's music was so lovely and inspiring and Gurmukh's teaching was excellent. I just finished her book recently and sincerity really seemed to shine forth here. I found this was more of a calming and centering practice for me than anything else but I really needed it. By the end I was practically in tears feeling the love and feeling a great sense of relief and connection. I would definitely check this out if you're having a hard time with life, it also gives you a sense of what being at an event like Sat Nam fest would be all about. I am sure I will watch this again soon.",1377907200,49,1736,4.302752293577981

Kundalini yoga has amazing benefits doing it each day has helped me in dealing better with stress as well as having better focus and energy.,1486598400,2,266,4.804347826086956
8587104,5,B00CX6SCNG,"I Bought this first as a Download on iTunes.
The first time i did Kundalini Yoga was with Snatam Kaur, but she was under the name Carol Carlson Grace and Strength. This is a Mother and a Daughter. It can be easy and a warm up or  a challenging and invigorating yoga Kundalini Flow.
The Work out is great to address mild edema and get the heart rate going if one has been sedentary. I am only 2-30 pounds over weight.
I have been doing this work out for less than a week and I already feel a real noticeable difference in how well i can move and this edema is less. I am noticing some great benefits and I think at the end of 40 days i will have more great things to say. GET THIS DVD! It is not traditional, but it is very beneficial  all the same! I Literally did cry when i first did it, tears just popped out, i felt a lot of joy and release and relief. It is great for aligning the Chakras. It is all about how much energy you put into it, so it can be easy or hard, vigorous or just a warm up. DO IT! Buy IT AND TRY IT, Even if you are skeptical! Anyone i knew or loved into yoga or into alternative preventative personal health, i would get this as a gift. I have it in my iTunes and my iPod, but i needed to have it in hard copy too.",1456099200,5,1240,3.8588235294117648
