8172431,1,B00004T3CU,"in the top 5 WORST DVD TRANSFERS I OWN!!!
This set is absolutely the pits, it's awful the quality is unwatchable, Fantasy mission force has not only film errors but also video lines and colourerrors with the picture shifting up and down. I've watched all three dvds they are all as bad they all look like EP copies of EP bootleg tapes of work prints DO NOT! I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS SET! It is awful it is even worse than the Slipstream DVD and the UK DVD of Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers, this beats them all hands down in terms of ....",1013472000,7,534,4.194174757281553
8172432,1,B00004T3CU,"I ordered The DVD ""Jackie Chan 3-Pack"" [DVD] only because it was supposed to include the movie ""Drunken Master"", a real classic I have been on the  lookout ever since I got into DVDs. The ""Jackie Chan 3-Pack"" are 3 DVDs handsomely packed and the  discs themselves are attractively overprinted, but alas, even though in one place ""Drunken Master"" is mentioned, it is not in  this pack. What the pack really includes are three DVDs of the worst quality imaginable!!! Even worse than than a 4 time re-recorded Video tape movie re-recorded on some inferior quality tape!!! My disappointment was replaced by a feeling of insult and and I was  overcome by the impulse to quietly discard these DVDs deep down at the bottom of the garbage can. Actually I took a chance ordering these DVDs because nowhere was there any information about them on the web only the vague mentioning of the ""drunken Master"" as being one of the pack. Which of course it is not!!! Now maybe other Jackie Chan fans will know better.",970617600,27,1000,4.6647727272727275
