8165318,2,B000LXGXUW,"My 3 year old who LOVES CareBears, did not like these episodes. This was her first and only exposure to CareBears on dvd and she did not like any of the parts with the villains, which is a fair amount of each episode. I was so shocked she didn't love them, but our TV viewing has been very limited and with no ""scary"" stuff: Kipper, Little Bear, Beatrix Potter.",1338336000,,361,4.246376811594203

8165321,5,B000LXGXUW,I really liked this collection of classic eps. The cloud of uncaring was my favorite one but I really enjoyed the others. Anxious for the new ones to come out.,1179446400,,159,4.333333333333333
8165322,5,B000LXGXUW,"I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed this dvd. it has six of the classic episodes on it. They are:

1. the best way to make friends

2. the two princes

3. the cloud of uncaring

4. the show down

5. beautiful dreamer-the show must go on

6. grumpy's little friend

three of the episodes are the ones where gram bear is telling hugs and tugs a story. and three of them are rescue missions. just to let you know. number five on the box is mislabled- the name of the episode is correct, but the description has been mixed up with a different episode. still, I highly recommend this dvd to the young and old alike. if there is any of you out there that freak out over No heart don't worry, you only see him in the either the second or first episode, so you can still show your kids the dvd and just skip those episodes, in fact, the last 3 episodes on the disc are all gram story episodes and No Heart isn't in any of them, they are just cute stories. I hope this review helps. keep on caring.",1174694400,14,993,4.035714285714286
