2761516,5,B000N95DI2,"My boys are entranced by this DVD.  They are watching it now as i type this review.  They sing the songs throughout the day and my 3 year old asks for it the moment he gets up.  I am not kidding.  Very kid friendly and fun. I have caught myself humming the ""Lots and lots of trains"" song many times so I guess that says something! :)  We are not big TV or DVD watchers but this DVD is very enjoyable.  I should know, I have watched and heard it about 100 times already in the past few months!  It has lead to many, many books on trains so we can understand what we see on the DVD.  I only have good things to say about this DVD.",1196812800,17,628,3.8515625
2761517,2,B000N95DI2,"This video appears to be nothing more than a repetitive collection of fairly dull amateur and promotional video clips set to a handful of pleasant, if forgettable, songs.  My son is two years old and can't stop talking about, or take his eyes off, of train, but this video loses even his attention after a few minutes.",1193702400,8,318,4.578947368421052
2761518,5,B000N95DI2,My son is only 14 months old and loves this DVD.  The first time we watched it he stood in front of the TV and danced to the nonstop music.  The music if very upbeat and fun.  I even found myself singing the theme song days later.,1181692800,10,230,3.851063829787234

2761525,1,B000N95DI2,Overpriced for the quality. My train loving(fanatic) kids weren't interested. Should be priced under the $5.00 mark.,1451865600,,116,5.882352941176471

2761531,1,B000N95DI2,This video sucks. My 2 year old loves trains and will watch trains online all day long. He loves hearing the horns and seeing the entire train pass by. This video does none of this. It plays stupid music and only shows the locomotive pass by. You never get to see the entire train pass and you hardly ever hear the trains. Only the music. The camera work is also crappy. I could have looked past that if we actually saw an entire train pass but that didn't happen. My son didn't watch one minute of it. Ten bucks wasted.,1434585600,5,520,4.21

He wants to hear the roar of the train whizzing past. He wants to hear the train linking and whistling and all that jazz. You don't hear an iota of that with this dvd.

2761559,1,B000N95DI2,"First off, the DVD arrived damaged because of poor packing. After we received a new copy, we were unable to play 4 out of the 8 tracks because the menu simply didn't work. If you are OK with being only able to watch half of it (the half with music dubbed over - the other half supposedly has the train sounds only), then buy it. Otherwise, there are free alternatives that are much better.",1402358400,,389,4.27027027027027

2761562,3,B000N95DI2,"My 2 year old son loves the Lots and Lots of Trains DVDs.  But I've ordered 3 of this particular DVD now, and all 3 have been defective in the same way.  They all freeze on the same scene, and then won't move forward or backward.  I have to eject the disc and start again.  Then, from the menu, it won't actually take you to the last 4 videos.  It's like the last half of the DVDs are defective.  I have replaced this item twice from Amazon (they have been wonderful), but all 3 of the DVDs are defective in the same manner, so the entire batch seems to be bad.

I may try ordering at another time to see if the bad batch has finally been pulled and I can get a good one.  Because, like I said, my son loves these DVDs.",1399075200,,719,3.9444444444444446

I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend the movie to any mom with young children. I only have one complaint, and that is the movie does not automatically start over once it ends. This would not be a big deal if it were a longer movie but I do have to constantly restart the DVD.",1383350400,,415,4.0120481927710845

2761583,4,B000N95DI2,"My son likes the video enough, but that is because he likes to see trains no matter what.  The video is horribly short...and probably not worth the amount you pay.  I am disappointed and wish that the creators could have been more honest and let people know that it is just snippets of a lot of different trains.  We also have Train Crazy Kids, which is much better...it is longer and has some narration about the trains the kids see.  But overall I am seriously disappointed in the length of the video.  The video claims to be ""approx"" 45 min.  I really think it is closer to 20 minutes long.  I will time it and hopefully post that.

*Update*  My son loves this DVD.  Enough so that I had to purchase #3.  He watches them all the time.  I do think they are a bit short, but if he doesn't mind and loves them then they were a great buy.  I can still only give 4 stars because I feel they are a bit short.  If your kid loves trains like mine does, then they will probably love these movies.",1329868800,5,990,4.1421052631578945

2761585,1,B000N95DI2,"Video was nowhere near what I expected. It was a waste of every penny I spent. 300 snippets, and not a single piece of data. Railroading is rewarding only when you know where a particular shot was taken, you are told about the engines & rolling stock, & something about the specific railroad you are watching. It MUST be educational, which this video is NOT ! I cannot return it, per Amazon's policies, so I guess I will have to simply throw it away, & chalk this whole thing up to experience.

There is no narration; the music; sound and quality of the dvd's is cheesey.  The quality of the picture seems like one of those old VHS movies.  It kept my grandson's attention for about 15 mins, and that was only the first dvd. I sat there astounded on how this didn't go directly to the Dollar Store bins.

We had an old educational train video that our grandson liked to watch, but was so corny that the rest of the family dreaded him asking to watch it. That is not the case with Lots and Lots of Trains - we all enjoy watching this video with him.  It is fun to watch the trains and listen to the lively music.

8175713,1,B000N95DI2,This is awful. The worst part is that you can't even hear the awesome train sounds because everything is drowned out by ridiculous honky-tonk music. It's way too fast---so chopped up that you don't even get to watch a whole train pass by before they quickly cut to another train racing by. It made me dizzy and my son lost interest after 2 minutes.,1475280000,,348,4.453125
8175714,3,B000N95DI2,"My son loves trains and loves music. That's why he loves this video. It's just footage of different trains. That's it.
