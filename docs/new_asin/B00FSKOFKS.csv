6030830,4,B00FSKOFKS,"Several disks were glitchy, stopping mid-play, picking up again with seconds or minutes missing. Some of the plots toward the end of year three were weak, too. In the last episode where Castle pins Beckett's arms and carries her out of the hanger is not believable in the context of the series, based on the fighting skills Beckett supposedly has. I forgive them, though.",1438214400,,371,4.8125

We are late comers to the show, just starting to watch as Season 7 is being currently aired on ABC.

But, seriously, we both love Castle and having all the past seasons in one place is great.  There are a few shows that I missed the first time around (we are late-comers to the Castle fan club as we only started watching it about a year ago) which made getting the set worthwhile.  Plus, when we camp (in an RV), this is one of our ""must take"" sets to watch on our laptop as the shows are so entertaining we can watch them again and again if, for nothing else, just to observe the interaction between Castle and Beckett.",1425859200,2,636,4.19672131147541

6030886,2,B00FSKOFKS,"I have had a terrible time with this set of DVDs. I bought these discs new and sealed, but all of them have given me problems when loading them and attempting to play them on my DVD player. In the end the quality is great but I end up with this grinding sound, like the disc is not in the holder properly, or the disc was not cut perfectly round and is oval-shaped so is thus turning improperly inside the machine. Sometimes the noise goes away, sometimes not. Sometimes this keeps the disc from playing, sometimes not. It's an old DVD player, so I might blame it on that, but none of the other shows or movies I watch do this, and this series does this in each of the 5 disc-holders in my machine. This review isn't meant to scare you away from buying this set of DVDs, just to warn you, as have others, that there are a number of poorly made Castle DVD sets out there and you should beware. If I had purchased 20 of these sets and all 20 were bad and were like this or worse I would then say not to buy but I have only bought this one set and read of others. Even still, many others had good experiences. All I can really advise is, caveat emptor. Let the buyer beware. Yes, beware that you have a safe and foolproof product return plan in case it comes to that.",1414800000,,1264,4.100806451612903

6030897,5,B00FSKOFKS,"I love this show, everything about it is interesting. It reminds me a little bit of the X-Files, where there's a ongoing conspiracy Kate  and Castle and unraveling as seasons go along and battle a powerful politicians and then there are episodes in between where they solve cases unrelated to it. It's fantastic and I recommend it to anyone.",1412380800,,341,4.779661016949152

I have to turn off SO much stuff due to SO much trash in some series, but not Castle. Sure there are a few episodes that I have to ignore, but I really think the character development ,(the main characters get BETTER! They don't go on a downward spiral!) the writing, and the casting really give the best mainstream series ever. I will say, I don't let my kids, even teens, watch this, We are careful about what we let them view though compared to many.",1411344000,,575,4.097345132743363

6030966,5,B00FSKOFKS,"Even though I'd seen nearly all of the episodes (some of which I didn't like too much), I did enjoy watching them...without commercials which was great.  The writers must have been 'changed' during the 4th season, and I was totally disappointed in the shows when I first watched them, and actually 'skipped' a few from that season.  I haven't seen the 6th season, except for the last episode, and it looks like they've 'worn it out'...  the 'magic' they had together seems too much like acting in it...",1403308800,,502,4.681818181818182

6030968,5,B00FSKOFKS,"I love Castle's literary take on the usual crime drama. The clever references throughout to art, literature, and history make it stand out from the rest. Plus the acting and storylines themselves are fascinating. The characters have such strong personalities, yet are not static - they truly evolve from one season to another. It's fun to see how Castle and Kate are changed by their interactions with each other. They go from an antagonistic pair who struggle to work together to true teammates, softening each other's edges and bringing out the best in each other. I was excited to find all 5 seasons bundled together!",1401840000,,620,4.914285714285715

If I had known you could barely see them to watch would not have purchased them. Pray session 6 is not like session 1-5.

All the regular characters are flawed just enough to make them realistic, but heroic enough to make them lovable.

The only problem we had was with Season 5 - some of the disks had some issues like pauses in the show but not so bad that we didn't enjoy watching them.,1397520000,,347,3.942857142857143

Amazon resent my request to return the shipment and get my money back. I'm still waiting for a reply. I have two DVD player's and they did not work in either one.

6031006,5,B00FSKOFKS,"I love this series. The cast chemistry is interesting, the approach to the storyline is entertainig and different; the cliche's are common and silly and make me laugh. I started watching Castle on cable and started to wonder how this series began - so I purchased the five seasons.  I watched the entire first season in a few hours and loved it!  A famous writer who is read by just about every important person in city government and Castle's connections to them becomes hillarious. I enjoy the fact that Fillion's character is a single dad raising his daughter and their relationship is superb.  The actress who plays his daughter is intelligent as well as wise which is delightful and funny and her character meshes so well with her dad's.  Castle's mom, who reminds me of an Auntie Mame type, is flambouyant and funny and adds just the right femfatale touch.  Each character contributes to unblocking Castle's writing.
The fact that he shadows a female police detective as she deals with homicides and sometimes gets in her way makes for a tour de force that's edgy and entertaining.",1392681600,6,1087,4.791443850267379

Love how Javier and Ryan have developed, don't care for Gates as a replacement for Montgomery, but oh well.  I can't understand why they're never nominated for Emmys -- the shows when Beckett got shot should have at least been nominated for editing.

6031018,2,B00FSKOFKS,"Purchased the Seasons 1--5 box set (used), through an Amazon partner.  We have only gotten part-way into Season 2, but every episode so far has the sound-timing error.

We have been trying to not notice this problem, but it seems to get progressively worse as the episode goes on.  At first, it seems like the lip movement doesn't match what's being heard.  By the end of the show, the dialog line is heard, then there's a brief pause before the actor moves his lips.  Or you hear a crash, and a moment later the source of the crash is shown--a lamp falling over, or something.

I'm concerned that I've got a pirated copy; but I have no way to prove or disprove it.. The printed materials seem genuine.

We're very much liking the show otherwise.  The daughter is too saccharine (she gets better in Season 2) but the main characters are excellent.  Plot development is reasonable.  Overall, even with the lip-sync problems, we'll still watch the rest of the episodes.

EDIT:  We were told to stop the show, and ""rewind"" to the beginning of the scene when the lip-synch problem gets noticeable.  We did this once, and it made the problem almost go away.  It seems that the lip-synch error is an interaction between the coding on the discs, and the de-coding of my DVD player.  Again, no other discs in my collection have this lip-synch error...but if you have a different DVD player than mine, maybe you won't have this problem at all.",1390435200,,1434,4.590551181102362

6031028,3,B00FSKOFKS,"I received this as a gift during the holidays and have finally had the time to open and start re-watching the episodes. Sadly, 2 out of the 5 discs in season 2 are badly scratched (to the point of freezing in the middle of episodes),  4 out of 5 discs in season 3 have light to moderate scratches, the top of season 4's case is broken (to the point of not closing properly) and 3 discs out of 5 are scratched and 2 out of 5 discs of season 5 are lightly to moderately scratched. All of these discs arrived and were presented to me in their shrink wrap packaging. It almost seems as if these are used DVD's that were re-wrapped, due to all the damage presented. I love the show, but the damage to the discs and casing are very disappointing.

EDIT MAY 2014
I've tried two different DVD players, and disc 3 of season 3 no longer works at all. PLEASE buy the DVDs separately, and not this bundle.",1389225600,18,893,4.186046511627907

6031039,5,B00FSKOFKS,"Getting the boxed set at this price, and still factory sealed, was a great way to add all past seasons of the show to the collection, and get this wonderful series for keeps!  All that needs to be done now is to simply add Season 6 when it is released.  This is one of THE best shows to come out of the last twenty years of television that isn't a stupid survivor-type show (there are too many....), a purely-drama cop show, or a show devoted to either some crass (and possibly rich and spoiled) family (like the ridiculousness of the Kardashians or the Honey Boo Boo idiots), or stuff that shouldn't be on prime time at all because the line of gore has been stepped over (such as Walking Dead).

If you like none of those types of shows and want pure entertainment, Castle is just plain fun -- gripping and suspenseful like any cop-show such as CSI, but full of occasionally smart yet sexy moments that really don't preclude someone of younger age watching it; good humor; life-reflecting moments; and good story lines such as the old shows like ""Murder She Wrote"" or others of the best shows out of the 1970s-1980s -- as it should be with its ""godfather"" being Stephen J. Cannell!

Yet it contains nothing that would disgust or turn someone off with bad imagery of blood and guts or gratuitously visual sex steam.  It's smartly filmed by some of the best in the business -- Jonathan Frakes (of Star Trek fame), for instance, is a regular director on the series.  And of course, if one is a Firefly fan, this show is a MUST to be able to see more of the wonderfully talented (and yes, handsome) but funny Nathan Fillion's work!  He heads up an incredibly talented cast, and that is just as important as writing and crewing.

Get this series...it will be well worth your while to do so, as there are many hours of enjoyment in it!",1387756800,34,1830,4.441791044776119

8618489,2,B00FSKOFKS,"The famous tv series CASTLE is undoubtedly rather interesting, several episodes are excellent, some awful or pesky or fastidious, even unclear, unreal. I have seen the first three seasons. How much better is anyway the series called WITHOUT TRACE. The performers are decisively perfect and nice - let me put at the top the beautiful and bravissima Stana Katic, but  BUT how is it possible to endure Nathan Fillion? All his expressions - poses? affectations? grimaces? -  are like those of an unpleasant and ridiculous clown who induces me to feel unhappy - is it ever the direction ordering him to act like that? Wrong direction!  And then all the Castle-Mother-Daughters scenes  irritate me too much: almost disgustingly sugary. When the dear old MGM films  had a touch of honey it did not come so false and bothersome as here; in those good old days all was done with sincerity, here it is irredeemably fake. Surely the lauded script is perhaps the real guilty party.
Anyway if you like CASTLE, be happy with the series; believe me, I don't want to lead you to my opinion, but I wonder if so many hosannas are so happily sung because vox populi say it is something special. Se piace a lui, se piace a lei, deve piacere anche a me!
Dont change your opinion  Ill do the same.
