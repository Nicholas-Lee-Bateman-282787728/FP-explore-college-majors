8397773,5,B003IZAMWK,"This is a nice hunting video. It is not disrespectful of the animals, not too commercial, and does not rely too much on guides. As a result, it is an enjoyable video for hunters to watch during the off season. It is comprised of video using older footage, and as a result, has a bit of a retro feel. Still, for the price, it is a very nice video to have in one's collection. I would suggest it to any hunter.",1515801600,,408,4.049382716049383
