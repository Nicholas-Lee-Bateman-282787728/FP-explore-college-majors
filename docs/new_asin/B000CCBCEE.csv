8097091,4,B000CCBCEE,"The Cinema Deluxe Terror Pack (2005) is a collection of six films in the horror or suspense genre from the early 70s.  The films range in quality, but overall they provide a nice representation from the era, covering a wide variety of subject matter, from terrorist acts to the supernatural.

Heres a quick overview of the films:

Crucible of Terror (1971) (3 stars)
The story revolving around an eccentric artist, who takes advantage of women, doesnt make much sense, but the film does feature some gory kills, and an unexpected killer.

Horror Express (1972) (3.5 stars)
A mysterious ancient creature gets loose on a train travelling through Russia, and begins to prey on the occupants.  Features Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, and Silvia Tortosa.  For real fans, there is a&nbsp;&nbsp;available.

The Mad Bomber (1973) (4 stars)
With some shocking scenes of destruction, The Mad Bomber features Chuck Connors, probably best known for playing Lucas McCain in the TV series The Rifleman, as a man whose anger and pain, has driven him to extreme violence.

The Baby (1973) (3 stars)
Sick and twisted, The Baby features an adult male who wears diapers, and behaves like an infant.  Trouble begins, when a social worker gets too involved in his case.

Psychomania (1973) (2.5 stars)
Also known as the The Death Wheelers, this movie deals with reincarnation, as members of a motorcycle gang attempt to kill themselves, so they can be reborn.

The House of Seven Corpses (1974) (2.5 stars)
While filming a movie in a mansion, deadly things begin to happen to the members of the cast and crew.

Featuring six DVDs in thinline cases, image quality of the Cinema Deluxe release is decent, but includes no bonus features.  The set is out of print, but might be worth a look for genre fans, if you can find it at a reasonable price.",1390694400,2,1824,4.84516129032258
8097092,5,B000CCBCEE,"Again ASIN: B000CCBCEE and B000C1VBBE seem to be the same only one set is cheaper.  Overall the quality of this set is very good.  One thing I will mention is that other reviewers on some of the single titles have noticed that the films are edited.  That seems to be the case fo The Mad Bomber.  The other titles I don't know.  One of the main reasons I got this was for Horror Express.  When the opening credits rolled I groaned because the colors were initailly dull and blurry, but once the credits were over the image quality improved greatly. Also, for some reason there are no ending credits.  The typical credit music plays but there is a blank screen.  A short synopsis.

The Baby-average story/great image quality.(suprise ending)
Crucible of Terror-great(IMHO) story/great image quality.
Psychomania-good story/great image quality.
The House of Seven Corpses-poor story/great image quality.
Horror Express-great story/great image quality.
The Mad Bomber-average story/great image quality.",1137974400,7,998,5.265822784810126
