8637700,5,B00HZY0RZW,"This is a Chinese Historical Drama adaption of a very real chinese hero Gao Changgong also known as the Prince of Lan Ling, There were some changes that have been made such as the addition of the main heroine Xue Wu, and other characters. As there isn't very much information on the actual figure of Lan Ling, I think that the entire film team did an amazing job of weaving together a masterful and compelling story of two people who were destined to meet.

I was hooked from the very first episode. I would watch it late into the night and in the morning before work, I just could't seem to pull myself away.  It is very rare for me to get hooked into a t.v show so absolutely where not only did I feel everything that the characters felt but even after watching it to the end it has stuck with me. I think this has to do in part to the Phenomenal chemistry of the lead actors Ariel Lin and William Feng, I don't think I have every seen a movie or show where the chemistry is as powerful as it was between them.

I would say this Show is a much watch!",1402790400,4,1052,4.121951219512195

8637702,5,B00HZY0RZW,"Since I got Lan Ling Wang DVD a few weeks ago, I have watched many of its 46 episode many times, and each time enjoyed them more than earlier times.  I highly recommend it for this and several other reasons.

For one thing, the series has something for everybody: Beautiful sceneries, epic battles, close combats, brilliant battle strategies, political intrigues, and so on, all folded into a love story between a country girl and a handsome prince. There are even 3-4 episodes about temptress and seduction for viewers who enjoy watching stories about women fighting each other for a man.

The story and script writers of the series should be commended for weaving a skeletal historical framework into a moving and entertaining story: The story is build around Lan Ling Wang (LLW). He was a real person, a prince who lived more than 1,400 years ago. History books say very little about him (a total of 2-3 thousand words approximately). What were said paint him as a perfect human being: Beautiful in appearance, kind and generous at heart, a once-in-several-lifetime fierce warrior, brilliant general, loyal to his emperor and family, and protective to his people. To LLWs life, they introduced the fictional heroine Yang Xue Wu, a young woman who in addition to being as righteous, kind and bright as he, possesses modern know-how ahead of her time. They met accidentally (or by fate as foretold by her grandmother), fell in love, got married, and so on. The writers beautified some of their historical contemporaries (e.g., LLWs younger brother An De Wang was fat and emperor of Northern Zhou Yuwen Yong ordered all Gao clan to commit suicide after he conquered Qi) and added some frictional loyal loving friends, together with other real persons (e.g., LLWs cousin emperor of Northern Qi Gao Wei and his evil queen, generals and so on) to form the cast.  The most impressive part of the story includes episodes leading to and including one of the famous battles recorded in Chinese history, in which LLW with 500 men defeated the massive Zhou army of ten thousand: The writers managed to make the story on how the battle was won rather convincing, while the history said so very little.
  Other reasons for recommending the DVD include acting:  Acting by almost all the cast is superb. Woman viewers are likely to appreciate that an emperor, a prince and a good friend all loved the heroine Yang Xue Wu and were willing to die for her. Man viewers are likely to want to be LLW, whom Yang Xue Wu loved and was willing to die for.
  This also is a good show to watch for people who want to learn Chinese. Even I, a native Chinese speaker, learned several infrequently used expressions and correct pronunciations  of several commonly used words.",1395705600,4,2747,4.8008474576271185
