8346162,1,B001VE8W1S,"I am just wondering how many producer screw Amazon and sell awful movies to them, actually it is not a movie, it is a punch of trash people living on drugs the wrst living condition, got a video camera, and trying to make a movie using drug addicted girls to show some nudity in return for the drugs they getting from the producer, or the (drug dealer). Save your money, and if you pay five cents for this movie you still pipped off.",1397952000,2,433,4.228915662650603
8346163,3,B001VE8W1S,I watched this.  I am a bit disappointed with the last part of the dvd.  The beginning part was pretty good where it showed one girl at a time.  I don't know what the last part was supposed to say...I was expecting a little more to this.,1303171200,,237,4.0
8346164,4,B001VE8W1S,"What can I say about this movie?
Well to start with it's not a whole movie...
It is many shortmovies, and all videos are very strange,
bizarr & Surrealistic... Some of the shorts I did not like at all..
They felt boring.. But some of them where great.

This is for people with taste for the extrem...
This is not for those with normal minds...

But I you are like me, (a little twisted) buy the movie and enjoy the ""fun""",1291161600,6,420,4.172839506172839
8346165,5,B001VE8W1S,"This is film like someone was told to do a CAMPY film in film school and they made an Academy Award worthy series of short films.  Some of it you can't take your eyes off of like the girl chewing food that she keeps stuffing into her mouth!  The three idiots attempting to make porn flick with ""LOW BUDGET"" people is GREAT!  The cinematography and editing is well done. Having said all of this, this film is not for everyone!  It is NOT a porn flick; however there is explicit sex and nudity!",1265328000,10,492,4.258064516129032
8346166,5,B001VE8W1S,"Chicago-based filmmaker Usama Alshaibi is the modern master of transgressive cinema. The DVD ""Solar Anus Cinema"" collects nine of his female portraits filmed between 2001 and 2008, plus the longer narrative short film The Amateurs, produced in 2003.

For the portraits, Alshaibi films different women, including his wife Kristie Alshaibi, either fully nude, partially nude or in various stages of undress. But these aren't loving erotic gazes. There is a hint of performance art in the way the women writhe, gyrate and strut in front of Alshaibi's mostly manic camera that races around their bodies as if excited by each and every part of their form.

Each portrait is also imbued with either just a hint of violence or an explicit vision of it. Blood comes out through various wounds and orifices to remind the viewer that these visions of loveliness are real, physical beings.

""The Amateurs"" is a longer short film with a story. It's a fictional comedy in which Alshaibi has cast himself as an amateur pornographer auditioning women to perform with his two male cohorts in front of a camera.

Most of the comedy of ""The Amateurs"" derives from the men being unable to fulfill Alshaibi's outrageous requests. While several moments of the film are laugh-out-loud funny, the precarious situations the men and women are placed in grows more-and-more uncomfortable and squeamishness-inducing, making for a complicated, unforgiving experience.",1246665600,19,1439,5.216450216450217

I can't believe this...The girl in ""Spoiled"" is crazy.  She's like a cute little piggy brat turd eater!  This collection will make you want to get freaky y'all.",1240617600,,229,4.255813953488372

A must see. This is such an interesting and intriguing film. Even the title is intriguing. It really captured my attention. I just had to see what was happening next.

This film is a compilation of short films. The performers were very good at what they were doing. Although some scenes are not for a weak stomach, the girl in the film ""Spoiled"", looked like she was having such a good time making a mess with her food. My favorite short was ""Convulsion Expulsion"". In this film, the performer was so convincing, I too began gyrating like she was while watching the film.

I think what really makes this film so good is the music. While some of it is sensory overload, some of it is haunting, such as in the short, ""Organ Molly"".",1236816000,2,881,5.2785714285714285
