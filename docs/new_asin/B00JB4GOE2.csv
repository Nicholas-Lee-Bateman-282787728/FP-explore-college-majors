6351867,5,B00JB4GOE2,"Excellent!  Anyone who has chronic pelvic pain or abdominal pain should order this today.  The DVD contains an important part of the path to recovery and allows you to take charge of this part of your treatment plan.  The exercises are demonstrated  and options are offered for  those with particular needs; for instance the exercise is demonstrated on the floor but for someone that cannot maintain this position the exercise might be shown seated in a chair.  The language is non-medical  and if a medical term is used it is used to empower the viewer and a thorough explanation is given.  The writer stresses the need to contact one's primary medical provider prior to  using the techniques demonstrated and to always stop if the technique is causing more pain.  The DVD can be used repeatedly as the viewer practices breathing and exercise positions.  Equipment needed to practice  the techniques is minimal and options are given.  The author stresses that this is not a quick fix or a cure all, but suggests this is an aid to  allow the viewer to take an active part in reducing pain and increasing physical abilities.",1406851200,6,1123,4.81151832460733
6351868,4,B00JB4GOE2,"I purchased this as follow-up to the book Healing Pelvic Pain by Amy Stein. I am under the care of a physical therapist but I live in a rural area and specialty care is difficult to find not to mention expensive. This DVD offers some good self-help tips and things to try, but I am in such bad shape that I am not able to do most of the exercises. My PT has modified some of them for me and we are working on them.  Ms. Stein says in the video not to do the exercises if your pain is a 4 out of a 10 and unfortunately mine was around an 8 when I started the abdominal massages under the guidance of my PT. We have things calmed down to about a 5 much of the time so long as I am using a TENS unit and not stressed. The DVD explains things well but I do feel it is more for therapists than patients. However, anyone who is suffering from abdominal and pelvic pain and who is desperate for relief should be able to find something here that is helpful, particularly if you have access to a physical therapist who can help modify exercises to meet your specific needs. I suggest you read the book first and then try the DVD if you feel like you need more guidance or are a more visual learner. I also think if you are having severe pain you should find a physical therapist who will work with you, as advised in the DVD. Also expect the healing process to take a long time.",1405728000,9,1369,4.033088235294118

6351870,5,B00JB4GOE2,"I highly recommend this DVD. It is clear, concise, and detailed at a pace that makes it easy to follow the exercises and massages along with the video. I like that it's divided into sections so that once you are familiar with it, you can fast forward to the sections that you need to emphasize. Amy is very clear in her demonstrations and recommendations for when the exercises are beneficial and how to listen to your body in order to make adjustments as needed.. She also provides a wealth of information about the anatomy of the pelvic floor.
As president of the Pudendal Neuralgia Association, Inc. I have highly recommended this DVD to all our members. As a matter of fact, I think that everyone with a pelvis will benefit from the information shared in this DVD! Well done.",1402790400,6,779,4.611510791366906
6351871,1,B00JB4GOE2,Repetitive and dry.  Better off with a book.  Took an hour to find an application to make it work in my Mac computer.,1402012800,2,117,4.043478260869565
6351872,5,B00JB4GOE2,"We are proud to be associated with Amy Stein and to be able to recommend this incredibly resourceful DVD to our pelvic pain sufferers. We loved it so much we decided to offer this to both domestic and international customers online. As pelvic pain sufferers ourselves, this DVD has helped lessen our pain so life can now be more enjoyable.",1400976000,4,339,4.666666666666667
8649523,5,B00JB4GOE2,"My doctor must have watched this and studied the book because this is EXACTLY what my physical therapist did.  She even started with the same breathing exercises as the first one on the DVD.  The only thing different was the bio-feedback.  I have dealt with pelvic pain for a decade now and am using Amy's DVD to try and help with that.  Although I cannot yet give an update on how well it will work, I hope to give you a success story later.  This is a wonderful product and I am very grateful to find it.",1468800000,2,506,4.175257731958763
8649524,5,B00JB4GOE2,"Highly recommend this DVD. I see a pelvic floor physical therapist but of course there are times when I need to do exercises at home if I can't make it in to see her, and I certainly won't do them myself unless I have someone guiding me through it, so I like turning on the DVD and following along to the exercises/stretches/massages that I'm capable of.  The abdominal massage has really helped my pain and my bowel health since I have significant bowel adhesions. Additionally, I find it to be very helpful as each exercise can be modified for what patients may need or what one could handle based on their level of pain. I also think it's a good resource for pelvic pain patients that may not have access to a proper pelvic floor physical therapist.",1455926400,3,752,4.489051094890511
8649525,3,B00JB4GOE2,"This is helpful if you are currently getting PT for this.  I have seen PT's who didn't give me this information and they really should have considering you pay from $150 - $500 per visit for PT.  I do recommend it - the only reason I give it only 3 stars is that I knew lots of the info already because I have read a lot on this topic.  Also, the ""stick"" used for self- massage is not really that great.  Possibly using a foam roller to the inner thighs would be easier.  Isa Herrara is also someone worth looking for getting better.  She has a website.  I am thankful for Amy Stein & Isa Herrara.",1440720000,6,597,4.094827586206897
8649526,3,B00JB4GOE2,Amy what do you recommend for a first time buyer of your product. To buy the book or DVD 1st. Thanks,1425686400,,100,3.8095238095238093

8649529,3,B00JB4GOE2,"I was frustrated by the low tech of the dvd--it needs to be watched in full, without sections to skip between or ability to fast forward.  Like reading a book without the ability to flip your own pages.  I felt this limited it's usefulness, as I wanted to explore first and didn't always have the time to watch sequentially.",1423008000,8,324,4.47457627118644
8649530,5,B00JB4GOE2,"As a longtime PT specializing in pelvic floor dysfunction in men and women, I wholeheartedly recommend this excellent DVD to anyone struggling with pelvic pain.  The content is accurate and Amy makes it easy to understand.  The program is safe, well-rounded and easy to follow.

8649531,5,B00JB4GOE2,"every dr. should read this - I gave an article referencing it to my gastroenterologist after a colonoscopy that
showed nothing...I would think that gynecologists and primary care doctors should be aware also before
all the testing begins...the exercises definitely help the pain subside as does time...but most of all, it's
nice to actually figure out what the problem is so you don't waste all kinds of time and money chasing after
tests that can't help the problem....",1416355200,8,470,5.038461538461538
