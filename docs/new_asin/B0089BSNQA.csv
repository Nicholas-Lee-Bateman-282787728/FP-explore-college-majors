5140915,5,B0089BSNQA,"What a great show. This was a serious drama that minimized the on-screen violence and gore according to the standards of the time. However, it still provides plenty of excitement. The wide jacket lapels, the flared pants, the ties that could double as lobster bibs, and the hat with the lieutenant's only b/w checked police hat-band, the polyester, the lollipops, and all the other cool 70s atmosphere. This show dealt with serious topics, and even though it was produced in the 70s, I still wouldn't let kids below the 7th grade watch it. It has a classy leading man, with an excellent supporting cast. There's a reason this show is considered a classic. Kojak is well worth watching!",1354060800,7,685,4.813559322033898

5140917,5,B0089BSNQA,"Telly Savalas is absolutely on the mark in his potrayal of Lt.

5140919,5,B0089BSNQA,"Kojak is great because it's so worth watching, and all seasons are released in a single set. They are reasonably priced. I have the four seasons that are out,and I am into the second one. This is how good they are as I buy them because I have no doubt that I will enjoy them. Get season one, it's cheaper and out, and you can start the craving for more seasons now.

Yes it may cost them a few bucks to do it. But they could get all kinds of people that are Hard of hearing to buy them.

And I see Shout pulled a fast one with  Route 66 TV show they put out. Had people buy the complet show, and not just put out season 4. Real smart Shout!
And all the B.S. you said you were doing to it. When in Fact you did Zip Zero.
Again Shout is Cheap and a rip off.",1339286400,11,479,3.6407766990291264

5140955,4,B0089BSNQA,"The final season of Kojak: Season Five, was great.  And like the rest of the Kojak releases by Shout!, the sound quality and picture quality was good.  Yes, there were a few blemishes and defects here and there (just like in Kojak: Season One [2005, Universal release]), but in my opinion, if you are a Kojak fan, this is still a good dvd set to buy.  And it's great they're also on single sided dvds, unlike the cheaper double-sided dvds by Universal.  And while all of the stories were good, ""The Summer of '69""  pt. 1 & 2 (12/1974) was especially entertaining, in my opinion.  I watched the entire Shout! Kojak: Seasons 2 - 5 series on my computer with no problems.

The only thing I didn't like about the Shout! treatment is that they put the storylines/plots inside of the dvd cover.  So when I want to find out what a particular episode is about, I have to open the dvd case, remove one the dvds, to be able to read the storyline.  This is bothersome to me.  They should have put the plot stories on the dvd intro screens themselves (like with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kojak-Season-One/dp/B00005JNHT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kojak - Season One</a>).  Or they could have put the plot stories on a sheet of paper and packed it into the dvd case.  That's a minor quip, but all in all, it's still a good dvd set for the Kojak fan to buy.

Also, a very good addition to the Kojak tv series dvds, is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kojak-The-Marcus-Nelson-Murders/dp/B005SQRYS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kojak: The Marcus-Nelson Murders</a>.  The Marcus-Nelson Murders tv movie (based on the Wylie-Hoffert Career Girl Murders, New York City, 1963) is what inspired the Kojak tv series.",1375747200,2,1785,5.283687943262412
5140956,4,B0089BSNQA,Usually the last season of any TV program really stinks. Kojak is an exception. The stories are full of good plots and characters. I like this package A LOT BETTER than the Kojak movies.,1372291200,,186,4.5
5140957,5,B0089BSNQA,"So this is the 5th and final season of the original (and best) Kojak.
Most series after a few seasons get tired and the stories become stale. Not in this case. The last season is every bit as good as the first.
All the characters return for the finale. The stories are exciting and looking at this series again after some 30 years plus I didn't realise how gritty it was.
The ""person"" not returning would be composer Billy Goldenberg. His iconic theme used in the first 4 seasons is replaced by John Cacavas (who was a friend of Telly Savalas). Cacavas scored the first 4. Its a pity as it would have been nice for Goldenberg to do this one aswell. Cacavas theme is a good one though.
Shout Factory have done us proud again with the mastering which is superb. Picture is crisp and the sound good.
CBS cancelled the show after this season due to falling ratings. A pity,but then Kojak for the audience watching went out on a high.",1369094400,7,929,4.375722543352601
