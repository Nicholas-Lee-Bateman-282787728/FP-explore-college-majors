8067231,1,B0009V6F5O,"I remember when this movie first came out.  I was just a kid at the time, but I had read a little about the Lincoln assassination and was already a Civil War buff.  Some of my friends saw it, and from their stories, the movie was quite different from what I'd read.  I didn't actually see the movie until I was grown, and by that time I'd read a lot more about the assassination.  The truth is, this movie is just a rehash of an old theory that was debunked long ago.  I dislike Edwin Stanton as much as anyone, and he was definitely unjust in his pursuit of Lincoln's assassin and his alleged conspirators.  However, that injustice was driven by his own vindictiveness, not by any attempt at a cover-up.  Furthermore, the idea that Booth got away is simply absurd.  Booth's body was identified by many people, including his own family.

In short, ""The Lincoln Conspiracy"" is an interesting movie, but almost pure fantasy.  If you want to read a good appraisal of this and other conspiracy theories, I highly recommend ""The Lincoln Murder Conspiracies"", by William Hanchett.",1515110400,,1074,4.634920634920635

8067234,4,B0009V6F5O,"This movie was filmed in historic Savannah, Georgia.  Elaborate planning goes into the shooting of each scene in a motion picture.  This film required a cast of more than 1,000 actors. Lincoln was portrayed by John Anderson, while Brad Dillman played Booth.  Other prominent actors included in this production include John Dehner and Ed Lupinski. The movie was made about the book of the same name and its claims. Perhaps the movie was made first as there are photos of some of the action.

This book verifies what I have always thought, but a smart person at the library put quaslifications on the fact that "" Mary Sarratt was the first woman in American history to be hanged."" The check-out clerk at the downtown library said that perhaps she had been the first official one. This book claims that there had been a conspiracy plot to kidnap Lincoln, and a conspiracy cover-up. At the famous ""Conspiracy Trial of 1865"" she was sentenced along with three males to hang the next day.

Some of the Northern commodities speculators and fianciers of the Union who were a part of the conspiracy include Jay Cooke of Philadelphia, PA, Henry Cooke of Washington,DC, journalitst Thurlow Weed, Robert D.Watson, Ward Hill Lamon who was U S Marshal, and D. C. Lamon, Lincoln's closest friend. Some of the Confederate leaders were implicated as were ""radical"" Republications in Lincoln's own party. Pictures of all of those accused are in the photo section.

This book goes into detail how John Wilkes Booth was able to get into the presidential box at Ford's Theatre unimpeded, and how he was able to escape out the back door after he jumped and broke his leg. Booth had a wife and daughter living on a farm near Harper's Ferry, Virginia, but he went in the opposite direction so as not to involve them. He used a 44 caliber derringer pistol, which looks like a prop for a play, it is housed in the Historic Museum on the site of the killing. Due to his dramatic training, he yelled ""Sic semper tyrannis"" (Thus always no tyrants) as he hit the stage on his knee.",1155686400,12,2051,4.667590027700831
