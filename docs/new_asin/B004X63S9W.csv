8446264,5,B004X63S9W,"This video was filmed at different times of day from early dawn to almost night in a lovely Japanese-style garden. The subtly Japanese-styled music and the sounds of birds in the garden worked well with the visuals. Focusing on a single object--an iris, the moon-bridge, the mist rising off the water at dawn-- gave a meditative feel. So far this is my favorite video of this series.",1341878400,6,383,4.731343283582089
