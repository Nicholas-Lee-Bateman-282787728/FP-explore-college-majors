888822,5,6304483074,"The King of Kings could and should be enjoyed by all audience members as it should not matter whether the audience is composed of believers, agnostics, or atheists.  The film has a global perspective, in sense, of religion, politics, economy, social responsibility, kindness, and existential philosophy, as it projects mankind's right to make daily decisions without influence by some greater power.  It is the choice of each person which the tale of Jesus represents as he offers everyone the opportunity to choose the light, which is a righteous path despite religious affiliation.  Nonetheless, the film emphasizes, as expected, Christianity as Jesus is the prophet that is spreading the values that come with the Christian faith.

On its premier in May 1927, the King of Kings could be compared to today's biggest blockbusters, while it attracted a larger audience than most films as some 50000 people were present just to catch a glimpse of the celebrated cast of the film.  The day after the premier the official release packed theaters to the limit as they allowed as many standing spots as the fire department would allow.  That is right, standing spots, just imaging to stand for two and half hours while viewing this epic film as it offered a silent cinematic experience.  Nonetheless, the film was accompanied by an orchestra that provided an auditory enhancement to the film while the images were moving on the silver screen.

The story needs no introduction, however, the King of Kings begins with Mary Magdalena (Jacqueline Logan) displaying her sinful lifestyle as she awaits her beloved.  When she finds out that he has abandoned her to follow Jesus (H.B. Warner) in anger she decides to visit the carpenter that she has heard so much about as he has cured blind, healed lame, and walked upon water.  When Mary Magdalena finally meets Jesus he purges her from the demons of the seven deadly sins.  This is the beginning of the Jesus' story which follows his set path to repent for the sins of humanity on the cross with his hands and feet impaled with nails.

The silence of the film provides much room for thought as visual interpretation of each scene is saturated in grand performances and detailed mise-en-scene.  The performances by the actors display meticulous details that emphasize the goodness of Jesus Christ and nature of all other characters.  The audience should pay extra attention to the movement and behavior of the characters in regards to the social setting in which they are located while viewing the film.  These movements are on occasion large and dynamic as they help convey the larger message to the audience, yet some movements among the characters are seemingly insignificant and minute.  However, it is these small movements that brings out the virtuous and compassionate nature of Jesus as it also presents the disposition of the other characters.  For example,  whenever Jesus shakes hands or touches someone he does it in a caring manner which is displayed through his full embrace of the handshake as he grabs the hand while letting the other hand gently hold onto the wrist.  These small details emphasize the goodness and willingness of him to help people choose the right path.

The director Cecil B. DeMille created an epic film that left the world with one of the grandest silent films ever made.  The film was also technically superior when it was released as the introduction and epilogue were colored and there was use of superimposed imagery, which was used when Mary Magdalena's demons were exorcised.  Cleverly Demille incorporated the written passages out of the Bible's New Testament, which improves the audience's understanding for what is being depicted.  The recent film, Passion of the Christ (2004), seems to have used large portions of this film in order to convey a similar message, but it fell short to DeMille's creation as his film has the power to withstand time.

CRITERION - provides this brilliant film with two different releases, the 155-minute version and the 112-minute version.  There are also numerous extra material such as telegrams, photos, and much more for the audience to muse over as Criterion offers a truly excellent release of the King of Kings.",1103932800,11,4235,5.007132667617689
888823,5,6304483074,"Uh...wow...not really a religious type of person, and it's not like we've HEARD this story before you know...

...but I found myself incredibly moved.

Heck, I'm not really particularly a silent movie buff, although I know that's not a popular thing to say amongst ""real"" critics.

But I think the combination of the silence, with the black and white footage, and an actor playing Jesus who pretty much looks like every single image I grew up with (lapsed Catholic) made it feel pseudo-documentary-ish. Kind of an odd feeling to be honest.

There for me to see, with what I perceived as authenticity, were people like Mary, Peter, Judas...all fairly clearly defined.

The movie is nicely paced...I'm talking about the long road show version here...and I wasn't ever really bored. Hypnotized, actually.

It's quite spiritual, and by the end, I felt like I was exposed to a beautiful presentation of the end of Christ's life.

You can read the more eloquent and educated reviews below; I just thought this was a really really good film, and I enjoyed it more than someone with more modern sensibilities would have expected.",1103760000,8,1121,4.930851063829787
888824,5,6304483074,"THE KING OF KINGS is a remarkable film. I don't think that I 've ever seen a more reverent version (sound or silent) of the life of Jesus. It stands out among other biblical epics in that it strives not just for a retelling of events but for a recasting of them into myth. DeMille captures the essence of Christ and those around him with sincere performances coupled with soft focus photography and 19th century lighting. There are many memorable sequences scattered throughout the film. The casting out of the seven deadly sins from Mary Magdalene is one and the raising of Lazarus from the dead is another. The crucifiction scene is impressive even by today's standards with lighting in the style of Gustave Dore' and a massive earthquake sequence.

There are some outlandish moments as well (it is DeMille after all) especially Mary Magdalene (as Judas' lover!) arriving to confront Jesus in a chariot driven by zebras. At 50 H.B. Warner should be too old to portray Christ but it is his age that lends a sense of gravity to the role. He has wonderfully expressive eyes which help to convey the inner spirituality of Jesus. Ernest Torrance as Peter strikes just the right balance between great strength and childlike simplicity. It's also interesting to see Rudolf and Joseph Schildkraut (real life father and son) portray Caiaphas and Judas. Watch for their scenes together. DeMille took great pains to avoid charges of anti-semitism by adding a prologue and having Caiaphas take the blame for Christ's death upon himself.

The restored 155 minute road show version is superb with the two technicolor scenes that bookend the movie looking great. There are important scenes missing from the general release version so it's great to have them both available so you can make the comparison. Thanks to Criterion for making this important film available once again. You don't have to be religious to enjoy THE KING OF KINGS. It stands on its own merit as one of the greatest movies of the silent era. It was also Cecil B. DeMille's favorite among all his films.",1102723200,12,2060,4.8328611898017
888825,5,6304483074,"Having just seen an advance copy of the two disc DVD set of Criterions release for Cecil B. DeMille's 1927 THE KING OF KINGS, I can tell you that you don't know just how great this film is until you have seen the uncut 155-minute roadshow version as first shown at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in LA and the Gaiety Theatre in New York.

Running 37-minutes longer then the fine 1928 shorter version (also included in this set with the original Hugo Riesenfeld score and sound effects as released in 1928, and an excellent newly recorded pipe organ score by Timothy J. Tikker), this is a marvel to experience! Beautifully preserved by the DeMille family, it has been transferred complete with two Technicolor sequences (rather then just one as we are used to seeing), and it has an outstanding orchestra score by Donald Sosin, that adds a new dimension to the film.

THE KING OF KINGS in its longer version is a far greater film then it ever was in its shorter form. This is easily the finest rendering of the Life of Christ ever put on film. A reviewer for The Saturday Evening Post (1927) correctly stated that:

""DeMille has achieved a masterpiece...a picture that is worth more than all the sermons ever preached. It is Spirit, on the screen.""

The Criterion Collection DVD release includes 2-versions of the film with three music tracks, a wealth of ""Extras"", including almost 15 minutes of wonderful behind-the-scenes on the set footage, reproductions of press books, the theatrical program, a trailer for the NY run of the film, stills, sketches, and a booklet.

This is the finest DVD to date on a silent classic, even surpassing Fox's excellent job on F.W. Murnau's SUNRISE. This is a MUST HAVE DVD!",1099699200,46,1707,4.734006734006734
888826,5,6304483074,"Cecil B. DeMille stated that ""King of Kings"" was his most important film, and it is a remarkable work that continues to have a world-wide impact. Because it is a silent film, it is used to this day by missionaries, and 77 years after its release, is still one of the best religious films available.
The cinematography by J. Pervell Marlay is excellent and it has marvelous effects, including the casting out of seven demons from Mary Magdalene in multiple images, and the earthquake after the crucifixion is astonishing; one has to wonder how they managed such brilliant effects with the limited technology of the time.
The scene where Jesus is asked to judge a woman caught in adultery (John 8:3-11) has a nice twist to it, in that what Jesus writes on the ground are the sins of the people ready to stone her. It is effective and good use of imaginitive filmmaking.
The cast:
H.B. Warner is a very nordic, stoic Jesus, blond with light blue eyes, often in a pose like that of traditional inspirational art, or the dashboard plastic Jesus of days gone by. Joseph Schildkraut (one of his last films was as Nicodemus in 1965's ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"", but is most often remembered as the father in the 1959 ""Diary of Anne Frank"") is a handsome bejewelled Judas, Ernest Torrance is wonderful as Peter, and Mickey Moore is a charming child actor as a young Mark (the future Gospel writer). Mary Magdalene (Jaqueline Logan) is shown as a wealthy courtesan, with zebras instead of horses to draw her carriage, living an empty life in a lavish environment, until she meets Jesus.
It has a few comparisons to Mel Gibson's recent ""The Passion"", in that they both received a furor of negative press upon release, both being accused of bigotry (which I believe to be a baseless claim for either film), and because DeMille's is silent with dialogue cards, and Gibson's in Aramaic/Latin with subtitles, one is sometimes reading directly from the Bible; in the case of this film, the scripture is sometimes out of sequence, often including verses from diverse sections in a single scene. Also, a memorable image they share that I do not recall from any other film is the crow on the bad thief's cross.
The end sequence is subtly colorized in parts, making the resurrection full of light with a pastel sunrise. Total running time one hour and 55 minutes.",1081555200,18,2347,4.7128953771289535
888827,4,6304483074,"Cecil B. DeMille never overestimated public taste, and his films tend to be overblown to the point of garish vulgarity.  True to form, he splashes his 1927 silent film of the life of Christ with sex and violence, and he never misses an opportunity to emphasize the obvious.  But KING OF KINGS has a simplicity and reverence that transcends DeMille's tendency to overt display, and it is to my mind the finest of his silent films.

This is not a ""line for line"" translation of the scripture to the screen, and DeMille makes no effort to turn the Gospels--which occasionally disagree with each other re sequence and detail--into the seamless story typically found in later films about Christ.  Instead, the film moves in episodic manner, highlighting various events in the life of Christ: the woman taken in adultery, driving the money changers from the temple, the last supper, the betrayal, the encounter with Pilate, and ultimately the crucifixion.

As is typical of the era, there is not a single member of the cast that looks distinctly Middle Eastern; indeed H.B. Warner, who plays Christ, is very blonde.  Interestingly, though, the film falls all over itself to avoid even the barest hint of anti-Semitism, placing blame for Christ's crucifixion squarely on the shoulders of high priest Caiaphas, who is carefully shown to be intolerably corrupt.  While this is not precisely scriptural, I personally found it a breath of fresh air in the wake of the rather problematic THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST.

While some of the performances are excessively broad, on the whole they are within the boundaries of what was considered realistic in the silent era, and some of them are quite fine.  H.B. Warner has a quiet elegance; the actor who plays Pilate gives what I consider a definitive performance of the role, easily surpassing later sound-film interpretations; and the actress playing an improbably scripted Mary Magdalene (who would have thought she was having an affair with Judas and had a chariot drawn by zebras?) is also extremely memorable.

Is this a truly great film, a film for the ages, the perfect cinematic vision of the last days of Christ?  No.  DeMille takes far too many liberties with the material.  But in watching it, you sense that every one involved had good intentions in making the film; it was not intended to stir controversy, but to provide a vision of Christ that is at once reverent, human, and Godly.  And that is perhaps more than other filmmakers have accomplished to date.

888828,5,6304483074,"I hadn't seen this movie since I was a little girl; then, I saw on my way to a church hall party that the film was going to be shown later in the church that very night with live organ accompaniment. Well, I left the party early to see ""King of Kings"" and that was no mistake! HB Warner turns in a sensitive performance as Christ, one of the best I've seen. His Jesus is gentle without being weak, which so often happens in other films. There's also a very talented child actor playing the part of a young evangelist Luke, who is healed of his lameness by Christ. For me, the most effective special effect sequence was in the beginning, when Mary Magdalene barges in on Christ and his followers. She is a brazen hussy driving a zebra-drawn chariot and is determined to give Christ a hard time for stealing away Judas, her apparant boyfriend. Then, as Christ merely looks at her, she undergoes a transformation as she is cleansed of the Seven Deadly Sins before our eyes. The appearance of each sin as it is drawn from her body is astounding. From that moment on, I was hooked!
If you would like to see an excellent version of the Christ story, look no further than this silent masterpiece.",1009756800,25,1189,4.409090909090909
888829,5,6304483074,"Imagine seeing this film, in a small theatre with folding chairs, at the age of seven, or six.  It was around 1978, during the Christian season of Lent.  This imaginative little boy believed that, since it was a silent  film, and silent films were made in the olden days, this film must've been  shot starring the actual Jesus and his disciples. Now, over thirty years  later, I saw this spectacu- lar again, with a live organ accompaniment in  San Diego.  If one is either a film buff, a DeMille  fan, a Christian, or a  seeker, buy this video. CB DeMille uses drama, lighting, action, and sets  with ""reverent"" (the oft-used adjective for this movie) restraint  and artfulness.  This film is  also a lesson in itself of premiere silent  acting style, early (and believeable) special effects, and wonderful  scoring.  This home video version  also features sound effects and the  legendary  technicolour sequence of the Resurrection morning.

888925,5,6304483074,"One of the greatest silent pictures ever made, and a supreme cinematic photoplay that stands with D. W. Griffith's The Birth Of A Nation, and Intolerance: Love's Struggle Through The Ages. From acclaimed director Cecil B. DeMille, the showman behind The Ten Commandments comes yet another dazzling Biblical spectacle to stir your spirit, and touch your soul.

The 2-Disc Criterion DVD presents this immortal masterpiece in two versions: the original 155 minute cut screened at the grand opening of the Chinese Grauman's Theater in 1927, and a shorter version recut by DeMille himself for general release in 1928, with four audio options: silent (1927 and 1928 releases), a new score by Donald Sosin (1927 release only), the original score by Hugo Riesenfeld (1928 general release) and a new score by Timothy J. Tikker (1928 general release), transcriptions of DeMille's introductory remarks and blessings from ministers of different faiths, the original silent trailers (Disc 1 only) and much more.

All of the scores for the film are appropriately reverent, but the only flaw is in Sosin's score during the scene in the Temple when the crowd cometh in waving palm branches, as on the soundtrack a choir is heard singing, 'Blessed is He who (cometh) in the Name of the Lord,' which breaks the mood of the picture, and the Alleluia at the end is distracting as well. But that should not dampen your enjoyment of this excellent motion picture.",1498521600,2,1441,5.02510460251046

Hands down, Hollywood always comes out with the most polished product.  Ten Commandments used some artistic embellishments which diminished it to me, yet still a great motion picture.

The medium of silent film required overt acting yet this film is often subtle in it's portrayals.  Mary Magdalene's change of heart in facing the Messiah.  The responses to Lazurus rising from the dead.  A saddened fisherman named Peter who hears the rooster's call.  DeMille was a master in setting the stage and a stickler for authenticity.

Not just walking around being all sorts of holy. He truly relates to people and surroundings - not the unapproachable individual that Jesus is so often presented as.

888970,5,6304483074,"This film is, quite obviously, DIVINE! This might be the BEST film about Jesus ever. I adored this 1927 black and white silent jewel! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

PRECISION: there are two versions of this film in the Criterion Collection box, the shorter 1928 cinema version (112 minutes) and especially the original full length 1927 version (155 minutes). I recommend with all my heart to watch the longer version.

This film tells the story of Jesus from the moment when he started preaching, soon after the Sermon on the Mount (not included) until the Resurrection. The film follows the Scriptures almost word for word to the point that virtually everything that is said (in fact written) is a direct quote from the Bible, with references. There is only a handful of very, very discreet changes - and they actually fit perfectly into both the story line and the general tone of Jesus teachings and works. Even if, quite obviously, I was familiar with the story, it still moved and enchanted me.

H.B. Warner played Jesus with PERFECTION! There is simply no other word to describe his performance. After the first five minutes, for me he WAS Jesus, to such a point that there were moments I almost forgot it was just a film. More generally the casting was PERFECT! Every single actor is exactly as his character should be. This film not only has a PERFECT Jesus but also a perfect Judas, a perfect Saint Peter, a perfect Caiaphas and even an absolutely perfect Satan!

The scenes in the Temple are better than anything I ever saw in other films about Jesus. The Crucifixion scene is of course not nearly as gory as the one in Mel Gibson's movie, but it is an incredible apogeum of the film. Dysmas is usually welll shown in films about Jesus but here the director gave also some extra time to Gestas - and those extra moments (completely heartbreaking) were a great idea. The Resurrection is a glorious and joyful thing, which will probably cause all believers to shed some happy tears.

I don't have words strong enough to praise this film. I am absolutely going to keep the DVD and watch it again. This is an absolute masterpiece, recommended to all amateurs of good cinema, regardless of their religion or lack of such. ENJOY!",1457222400,,2262,4.702020202020202

The story itself is a mix of Christian theology, bible, and just plain silly. Mary of Magdala is a party girl and Judas is her boyfriend. Both of them party with the high priests. The ""author"" of the Gospel of Mark makes a guest appearance as a boy who is healed by Jesus. Judas is called ""the ambitious"" and Peter's nickname is ""the Giant"", etc. etc.

We then begin to meet the disciples, including the child Mark who has just been cured of lameness, and a little blind girl, who when she receives her sight gives us the first glimpse of the face of Jesus. Next Jesus casts out Mary Magdalene's seven evil spirits, and from then on the film takes on a more lethargic tone until the climactic ending with earthquakes and storms accompanying Jesus death.

I actually believed a 40+ actor was a 33 year old, kind, loving and spiritual Jesus in pursuit of the truth of his message and understanding the limitations of people around him to believe and the horrible end he faces yet has to.

There's sex, comedy, corruption and evil. There's classical cinematography at it's best and incredible sets and costuming. 1920's special effects are lavish throughout and technically amazing. Jesus' death at noon is one of the most powerful things I have ever seen.

In the scene with the children he talks to them and we wish we could hear what he says but the children seem really interested in him. It is true that Warner was 50 when he played the part but his acting helped communicate a role which is not cliche but is indeed inspiring. Some have thought the film is antisemitic in the portrayal of the priests but it should be noted that the majority of the characters are playing the parts of Jews and are not portrayed as negative. The most visual part of the film is the climax with the crucifixion and the resurrection( in color). The death of Christ is over the top, loaded with earthquakes, fires, and a storm. Then we are treated with the resurrection in which we see Jesus walk out of the tomb. This is typical Cecil B. DeMille stuff and worth the watch.",1429920000,4,1065,4.411167512690355

889064,5,6304483074,"One of thd Greatest Movies to have ever been made in Hollywood about the Life of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ as it depicts the Divinity of Our Lord in a clear way and with the utmost reverence that reflects the Historical reality of the Gospels. It doesn't follow the apocryphal writings that are wrongly called gospels , but instead it follows the Four Historical Gospels in an amazing fashions paryicularly the Gospel of St. John. It is also one of the best movies that depicted the earthquake and the darkness that engulfed the earth at the time of Our Lord's death on the cross, moreover it is the best movie that depicted the Bodily Resurrection of Our Lord and God Jesus Christ in a such a way as to show the magnificence of his Divinity in the power of his Glorious Resurrection. In the scence when Our Lord is shown exorcising the seven demons out of St Mary Magdalene we see clearly the power of Our Lord Jesus Christ to forgive sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness regardless of how sinful we might be. The Final scene where we see his apparition to his Virgin Mother St. MARY and his Disciples is done an a way such as it combines all the apparitions of Our Lord to his Disciples after his resurrection as depicted in the Only Four Canonical Historical Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John in just one scene as he also deals with Thomas incredulity to transform him into the disciple who declares loudly the Divinity of Our Lord Jesus Christ after seeing that he has risen bodily from the dead when he said to him '""My Lord and My God. The final scene where we see Our Lord and Gos Jesus Christ ascension i to the heavens and meanwhile we see him embracing with his Divine eternal hands the modern cities and the modern world as if to say that even in the darkness of sins, violence and wars of this so-called modern world, He is still with us waiting for our return to him and he is faithful and just to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. This is an amazing film and for those who are familiar of the subtle messages of Cinematography particularly that of Cecil B. De Mille, they will enjoy this movie spiritually and also intellectually as they will find themselves drawn to the Beauty , Holiness and Divinity Of Our Lord and God Jesus Christ and to the Salvation that only He can offer, as Cecil B. DeMille himself has said when he he was directing it.

889124,5,6304483074,"This is an epic that examines the life of Jesus Christ during his last few years of life leading up to crucifixion and resurrection. Director Cecil DeMille made this film in the hopes that it will be one of his finest creations. After watching this movie there is no doubt in mind that he is the master of movie making. Over the years, many versions of this movie have been made and my favorite is Cecil DeMille's 1927 classic. This silent classic essentially captures the moment of Jesus's crucifixion in a stunning photography and the resurrection scenes are magnificent. Much of the movie uses the apostolic verses from canonized gospels to narrate the story. This movie qualifies as one of the best holiday classics that must be aired during the holiday season.

The story begins with a social gathering at the home of Mary Magdalene played by Jacqueline Logan. When she finds that her friend Judas Iscariot was not at her house, but he is with his new friend Jesus. Mary pays a visit to Jesus and there she finds saintly Jesus performing miracles and healing the sick and poor. Some of the highlights of the movie I liked are: Jesus healing a blind girl; cleansing Mary Magdalene from the seven deadly sins; the ambitious Judas trying to cast the devil out of a possessed boy, and Jesus chiding him mildly after that incident; the stoning of an adulteress with Christ exposing her accusers' own failings; and the spectacular earthquake following the Crucifixion. The glow around Jesus after resurrection is amazingly captured.

There is some downside to this movie; actor H.B. Warner who plays Jesus is blonde and blue eyed and has very little appearance of a Jewish man who lived in Nazareth 2000 years ago. In addition, Warner was 52 when he played the role of Jesus who was in his thirties.  The movie depicts the relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene with utmost sensitivity and care, especially in light of the discovery of Gospel of Mary Magdalene at the end of 19th century along with many other gospels. Their interpretation by Biblical Scholars have been carefully examined and used in this story. In the movie, there appears to be some fondness between Judas Iscariot and Mary Magdalene which I was not familiar with from known Apocrypha.  This movie is a great holiday classic and I highly recommend this DVD.",1417651200,,2333,4.8104738154613464

889204,5,6304483074,The King of Kings (The Criterion Collection) is a 1927 silent film directed by Cecil B. Demille starring H.B Warner as Christ and Joseph Schildkraut in the role of Judas. Demille has here created a cinematic masterpiece and one of the best biblical films. The pacing is just right and the music is perfect. Warner as Christ is able to show Jesus both human and divine side of his personality. Schildkraut plays the role of Judas to perfection. Demille has decided to use many of the lines from the four gospels in the dialogue of the film and it works very well. A very sensual and moving picture that I highly recommend. 5/5.,1343088000,5,626,4.548672566371682

Each shot is like a painting, HB Warner did a superb job as Christ.  The score is very mellow and fits the film very well.  This film gives a more acurate depiction of the events in his life such as after the resurrection, the first person he went to was His mother, not Mary Magdalen, which is true, as His mother with her atunement with her son, also experienced the tremendous suffering He endured and she was distraught and in deep suffering.  The beginning and ending are in color, the cells were hand colored and it gives an interesting dimension.  The film has the feeling of a Heinrich Hofmann painting so it is superb.  Hofmann did paintings of Christ from personal visions, and the film has a sense of deep reverence and sacredness and you get a hint of the love and kindness Christ had for others and also His joy, especially when you see Him loving children and His friendship with others.",1329091200,2,1249,4.3852813852813854

The love of Christ oozes out throughout, and the verses cited make it clear that Christ gave His live a ransom for many.

The musical scores go along with the movie amazingly well, and it is actually better to have titles rather than spoken words.  No one is ever quite right sounding like Jesus.  This was a lavish production in 1927 -- the live animals, large crowds, etc. are amazing.  The film is sharp.  If you watch this movie, bring a handkerchief, because even the hardest heart cannot help but tear up.

The love of Jesus and His compassion really emerge from this movie.  The original, longer version is probably the better one to show, since it has the longer resurrection scene (done in color in 1927, if you can believe that). It will hold you spellbound.

889222,5,6304483074,"It is said that the art of the silent film peaked around the time of their extinction in 1927-28. Much of the masterpieces of that era (""The Patriot,"" ""London After Midnight,"" etc.) have not survived, but we can truly be thankful that ""King of Kings"" does.

This is an excellent rendition of the Story of Christ. Much of the tale is directly from the Biblical source (as shown in the title cards that quote chapter and verse) including the more obscure ones. The main characters are well fleshed-out, and as far as I can see, one of the few portions of the film that are not strictly Biblical in origin is the backstory of Mary Madgeline (who was never actually identified as a harlot in the scriptures, contrary to popular belief) and her love affair with Judas. Speaking of Judas, this film adds far more dimension to him as the villain of the story than any other version I've seen. Especially when he excitedly tries to crown Christ as an earthly King.

Jewish viewers, however, should be warned. The portrayal of the scribes and pharisees is unsubtle in the extreme (the trecharous chief rabbi even bangs a gong shaped into the Star of David). Even then, many Jewish groups were not thrilled by this (although a Rabbi was among those who blessed the film upon its debut).

H.B. Warner is also brilliant as Christ. He seems to have the proper mixture of humility and roughteous outrage (during the clearing of the moneychangers from the temple scene). He is also quite convincing in the role. Ironically, he later played a drunk in ""It's a Wonderful Life."" Aside form what other viewers have described, I particularly liked the dialogue between Christ and the two thieves during the crucifixion scene and when Mary embraces one of the thieves' mother. Quite well done. The 1920s style technicolor is also quite effective in the resurrection scene (similar to the nativity in the 1925 version of ""Ben Hur,"" another early classic).

Watch the long version (1927) first before seeing the shorter 1928 version with the original soundtrack. It's interesting to compare the two. It is said that missionaires made much use of this film in the years to come. You can see why, as it's still quite powerful.

Most silent dramas are now too mawkish for most modern viewers to watch more than once. This is not one of them. See it and be moved.",1236556800,3,2336,4.701711491442543

889224,5,6304483074,"Some years ago I purchased the 1928 version on VHS. It had, I thought, a superior music and effects soundtrack. This version's background music, to me, somehow did not match the drama unfolding on the screen, especially during the crucifixion and earthquake scenes. Some of the added sound effects, where necessary, were badly out of sync with the picture. You can always tune out the sound, since there was none in 1928. The longer 1927 version, also in this set, contained a few scenes which were justifiably cut from the 1928 release version. They just didn't work. The picture quality in these two DVDs is far better than that of my old VHS version. Some of the color scenes contained significantly more flicker, though, than was apparent in the black and white scenes. The graphics used to explain some scenes, I thought, were done more artistically in the original DeMille production. Having said all that, I still believe that this set is well worth having, especially in any Christian household, and will make a magnificent gift. The set also includes a very useful booklet containing many interesting facts about DeMille, the actors and how the original film was conceived and produced. This, in itself, adds significant value for those who are interested in film history. The depiction of Jesus by H.B. Warner is incredible, inspirational and unforgettable!

Soundtrack options; 1928 re-release composed by Hugo Riesenfeld or a 2004 organ soundtrack written and performed by Timothy J. Tikker. Supplements include written material and a 13 min behind the scenes of the actual filming of the movie. Although Don Sosin does a respectable job composing the score for Disc 1, It's Hugo Riesenfelds 1928 score on disc 2 that truly captures the heart and wonderment of this movie. I wish there was some way his soundtrack could have been incorperated into the uncut version. I personally found  Tim Tikker's organ score to be a droning bore. It spent more time sounding like a church organist warming up before church sevice starts. There is hardly any variation between scenes of intensity and scenes of tenderness. Speaking of tenderness. The scene that really chokes me up is where a cute little girl says to Jesus ""Mark saith Thou canst mend broken legs!"" I won't tell you what he does, but to see Jesus rely on ingenuity instead of divine intervention shows how beautifully human as well as divine he was. Why Tim Tikker was commissioned to write a score is anybody's guess. It's music like his that makes silent films hard to watch. Although it's quite a treat to see the behind the scenes filming, especially for a film made in the mid 1920s. There is no sound at all and no narrative that tells you who's who in the suits.

889296,5,6304483074,"As an artist, Cecil B. DeMille is often accused of crassness and crudity wrapped up in a moral tale. If ""The King of Kings"" isn't his biggest film, it's certainly his most reverent and honest as a filmmaker.

The casting works well, once you realize that this is essentially the whole of Hollywood putting on a Passion Play (DeMille aims high for accuracy in his films, though not necessarily Realism). H.B. Warner gives the performance of a lifetime as Jesus, played with restraint and subtlety. The supporting cast is filled with notable names, particularly Joseph Schildkraut as Judas, a standout performance. Viewers familiar with the history of silent film will recognize many if not most of the supporting and bit roles; virtually all are played by actors of some recognition.

Purists may decry the opening scene, with Mary Magdalene and her chariot pulled by zebras, shot in Technicolor no less. To be fair to DeMille, this is one of the few indulgences he allows himself in this film, which-given its subject matter-is a model of restraint, especially in comparison with his other biblical epics.

The cinematography, by J. Peverell Marley, is glistening black-and-white at its best. The Criterion DVD transfer is particularly good in this regard, with excellent contrast. The DVD provides two versions: the original 1927 ""roadshow"" edition, running 155 minutes with Technicolor scenes, and featuring an original score (viewers also have the option to listen to a newly-composed score on another audio track), and the 1928 general release version running 112 minutes. ""The King of Kings"" was once (and, according to some sources, still is) a staple of church film screenings, and was at one time estimated to be the film seen by more people than any other. This DVD does this excellent film justice.",1203984000,4,1808,5.08080808080808
889297,4,6304483074,"This great film was released NINETY ONE years ago (I'm writing this in April, 2018) during an era which our current society has all but forgotten. This only adds to the mystique of ""King of Kings""--which you could almost imagine was somehow filmed in Biblical times, so remote and mystical is its visual quality.

In viewing the Criterion set, I was continually awed by the way in which DeMille evokes the visual style of classic religious art ---it's as if you are witnessing the work of Da Vinci, Raphael, Tintoretto and Gustave Dore come to life on screen. (Rudolf Schildkraut as Caiphas has the uncanny appearance of one of Rembrandt's self-portraits right there on your TV screen!)

Once we are past the incredibly cheesy opening scene with Mary Magdalene and her Nubian zebras--that is, once the film gets into its black and white glory, De Mille composes almost every shot to reflect the majesty and reverence of the the great art work that we associate with the events of Christ's life. The iconic director arranges his actors and extras within each shot--especially during the ""Way of the Cross"" scenes---with a marvelous sense of DEPTH; all I can do is marvel at the visual texture of each shot, with the crowds of onlookers creating a succession of artfully arranged living tableaux.

The scenes of crucifixion and its aftermath are STUNNING---awe-inspiring and chilling---truly a Dante-ish Inferno of mayhem on film! The shots of HB Warner (having expired) on the cross in near darkness---with wind-blown leaves and lightning flashes---are breathtaking.  The 1928 soundtrack including a chorus of voices during these scenes---screaming, wailing, moaning along with the action on the screen (especially during the remarkably effective earthquake scenes), and this is an essential element of viewing the film I think. In fact, it's really too bad that the 1928 orchestral/choral soundtrack only exists for the shortened (112-minute) version, because the sound of this score is so evocative of the era in which the film was made.  You can't beat the final two minutes of the film, as Jesus leaves his disciples in the Last Supper room in a radiant glow--to the lovely strains of ""Abide With Me"", and then appears over a modern skyline to a full orchestra/choral rendering of ""Rock of Ages""; that's what religion USED to feel like.  The new score for the complete film is serviceable---all synthesized, though rarely is it distracting (a few incredibly lame synthesized cymbal crashes make me cringe). Of course, one MUST see the entire, full-length film....in which case the new synthesized score is your only choice.

A word about the cast: check them out on IMDB---you'd be amazed at how many of the actors had impressive credentials throughout the silent era and beyond, and yet whom are totally forgotten to us today. The actors who played the parts of Pontius Pilate and the Roman Centurion, for instance, are very impressive indeed---and their career background is fascinating. (There's something very cool about ""Hopalong Cassidy"" [Bill Boyd] stepping in to help ""Old Man Gower"" [HB Warner] carry his cross).  Of course, Joseph Schildkraut, looking every bit the matinee idol as Judas, was a very distinguished actor--check his Oscar-winning performance as Dreyfuss in 1937's ""Life of Emile Zola"" for starters---or his 2 Twilight Zone appearances in 1961/62. However, sad to say, his performance in this film is almost consistently over-the-top,
too often resorting to the sort of hysterical caricature that we usually associate with silent films and which, all things considered, DeMille manages to steer clear of in much of this great film (eg: HB Warner's performance, which is marvelously dignified and restrained).

It's a pity that so much of our great film heritage has been lost forever---which is why it's all the more important for Criterion and other companies to continue to preserve it---especially the masterpieces like DeMille's ""King of Kings.""

889299,5,6304483074,"While no match for Nicholas Ray and Samuel Bronston's 1961 film, the restored version of Cecil B. De Mille's The King of Kings is surprisingly good. It's a curious mixture of showmanship and sincerity, with sincerity surprisingly gradually winning over even if De Mille was using a film about Christ to defraud his principal backer into keeping his failing studio afloat with a lot of creative accounting (the film cost a million less than the accounts stated!). Although it skirts close to anti-Semitism at times for a film made by a Jewish director (albeit a closet one), it does ultimately make the distinction between good and bad people who happen to be Jews, adding a Jewish character who won't take Caiaphas' bribe to call for Jesus' death.

Starting off in typical De Mille mode, with Mary Magdalene breaking off an orgy to go after her errant admirer Judas Iscariot - ""Go harness my zebras, a present from the King of Nubia!"" - it never descends to the threatened kitchfest. Beginning towards the end of Christ's ministry, he plays fast and loose with the chronology (Palm Sunday AFTER Jesus goes to the Temple?) and it's a long way from history, but De Mille understood the power of symbolic design: Pilate's throne room may look nothing like the cramped quarters of most Roman buildings, but the giant eagle that towers and glowers behind his throne is a great piece of visual shorthand for the overbearing power and might of the Empire. And he pulls off some surprising coups de cinema, be it Christ's much-delayed first appearance through the gradually restored sight of a blind girl, the ghostly sins surrounding Magdalene, Pilate's first establishing shot or a strikingly powerful moment when the beam Jesus is leaning on outside a farmhouse is suddenly revealed to be a cross. De Mille also is a master of crowd scenes - these crowds are alive, a world of movement, with Christ's stillness setting Him apart.

H.B. Warner is a genuinely unexpected figure here considering the hollowed, balding old man of barely a decade later: very much a picture book Jesus, he does have a striking presence (when not overlit or made up with too much pancake) and there's a surprising warmth too - a scene where the carpenter repairs a child's doll is genuinely charming. There's a restrained power, too, most notable in the scene with the moneychangers in the temple, where an expected eruption of anger is instead turned into a simple tip of a table that is actually more violent in its controlled fury.

Don't expect a great movie - this is a great show, a Medieval Mystery Play filmed on a truly epic scale, and quite winning in its way. Criterion's disc is quite a winner too, with the picture quality of the uncut version quite outstanding aside from some relatively minor color fading in one sequence.

Also included  is the less satisfying two-hour general  release version, presented with a  synchronized score by Hugo Reisenfeld and some sound effects. Although  it works well enough  on its own terms, the loss of  some 44 minutes of footage loses much  of the detail and grace  notes of the roadshow  version - along with  the entire Galilee sequence (including  the memorable shot of Jesus  with  the cross), almost all of Mary's part is cut out, as is all  of Pilate's  wife and much of  Ernest  Torrence's Peter  (including his  denial of  Christ). The last third of  the  picture  seems  to suffer most of  all, with the trial before Pilate, the Way of the Cross and the Crucifiction  sequences all substantially shortened, while the color opening sequence is now  merely  black and white (the finale  is partially  Technicolor, though less  impressive than in the Roadshow version).

The extras are pretty good, especially for  a  silent movie - plentiful stills and text galleries, two trailers and a genuinely informative booklet. But best of all is 13 minutes of behind the  scenes footage of  De  Mille at  work or receiving visitors to the set like D.W. Griffith and  Douglas  Fairbanks Sr. -  you even get to see two children  fighting over the doll that Jesus repairs!",1146441600,11,4093,4.816091954022989

889301,4,6304483074,"Not being the target audience for this film, I had a different reaction to it than the average Christian viewer is likely to have, and as a historian, I take issue with quite a few of the events and things in here presented as fact (too numerous and off-topic to get into here).  Therefore, I was left to view this film not as theology or history but rather as a religious story.  Certainly this film is far more heavily religious than the 1961 remake, although the original also isn't as long as the remake and doesn't lose its focus by wandering off into subplots.  Although unlike the remake, the original covers less time; instead of beginning with the birth of Jesus, it starts about a few weeks before the Crucifixion.  And I know some people take minor issue with the fact that it doesn't exactly go in the order these stories take place in the Bible, although given how religious DeMille was, it seems to have been done respectfully instead of just arbitrarily cutting and pasting the most important stories together.

Though I didn't feel really moved or spiritually uplifted the way a Christian viewer would, there were some scenes I found very moving and touching, like particularly the scenes Jesus has with children, such as healing the blind girl and later on healing the broken legs of another small child's wooden doll.  Another moving scene is when he's shaping some wood and suddenly looks up and realises it's in the shape of a cross.  H.B. Warner himself gives a really moving performance, very well-suited for the role.  He was truly perfect for this role; another strong performance is by Ernest Torrence in the role of Peter.  Mr. Torrence usually did character work, and was often in a villainous role, but here this big bulky man really shines in a role different from many of the other ones he did.  Other points of note are the two beautiful scenes in  two-strip Technicolor, the opening scene (probably the only real non-Biblical scene in the entire movie) and the Resurrection scene near the end, as well as the cute scene where the Romans are hoping they'll find fish with gold in their mouths the same way Peter just did.

Cecil B. DeMille is a director the likes of D.W. Griffith; you either love or hate him, either find most of his films overwrought morality plays or excessive Biblical dramas with a saturation of sex and violence or find most of his films masterpieces or moving touching affairs.  However, whatever one's personal feelings about him may be, even many people who ordinarily dislike him have to admit this is one of his best films, one where he doesn't engage in many excesses.",1127174400,12,2628,4.699346405228758
889302,5,6304483074,"Calling The King of Kings a cinematic masterpiece barely begins to do it justice, and this Criterion Collection release is absolutely beautiful, turning the widespread notion of silent movies completely on its head.  This print looks like it could have been made yesterday, not 1927, boasting some incredible special effects for its time.  Cecil B. DeMille was a genius who helped turn moviemaking into an art form.  With The King of Kings, he also retold the story of Jesus Christ in a serious and emotionally powerful way that has effectively helped spread the Gospel for over seventy-five years.  This Criterion Collection release is itself a heavenly release that gives viewers the chance to own the film in its original, uncut form for the first time.

While DeMille's film is a reverent retelling of life and heavenly mission of Jesus, it does take some liberties with the Gospel accounts, sometimes combining different events into one and introducing several of its own elements in an attempt to emphasize the linear nature and importance of the story.  Mark, for example, is presented as a child healed by Jesus who is there to witness the ministry and ultimate sacrifice of Christ.  Judas Iscariot is constantly shoved to the forefront of events, heavily emphasizing his misinterpretation of the Messiah's mission and ultimate betrayal of Jesus.  He is depicted as a selfish and ruthless man who only joined Jesus' band of followers because he expected to be made a great man in the traditional kingdom he expected Jesus to found on earth.  Most interestingly, Mary Magdalene is depicted as a consort to Judas who first comes to Jesus in order to confront Him for having stolen Judas' attention away from her.  The film also shows Judas witnessing the events his kiss of betrayal set in motion, hanging himself only after witnessing Jesus' death on the cross.

The film begins strangely, with an extended scene of Mary Magdalene living lavishly among a group of male admirers and then zooming out on her zebra-driven chariot to steal her man Judas back from Jesus.  As for Jesus, His first appearance could not be more beautifully done, as we first see His face through the eyes of an adorable blind girl as she is healed by the Master.  H.B. Warner looks a little too old to be playing Jesus, but he gives a masterful performance, one heightened by the constant aura of slight luminescence DeMille gives him throughout the film.  One of the most memorable scenes is the release of the seven demons from Mary Magdalene - the special effects are just incredible and seemingly decades ahead of their time.  Speaking of incredible special effects, one has to mention the earthquake scene that follows Jesus' death on the cross - again, it's just incredible to watch.  The resurrection scene is also memorable for the Technicolor aspects DeMille gave it to emphasize the awe-inspiring magnificence of Jesus' victory over death.

The 1928 general release of The King of Kings was 112 minutes long, but the film that first debuted at the opening of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in 1927 was 155 minutes.  Both versions of the film are included in this set, and I must say the original, uncut version of the film, rarely seen by the public over the decades, is the definitive version presenting a much richer, detailed account of Jesus' ministry.  This Criterion Collection release boasts a number of extras, including new film scores alongside the originals, documentary materials on the making of the film and its reception by the public, trailers, portrait galleries, and a 40-page commemorative booklet on this Biblical masterpiece.  Have I mentioned how pristine the digital transfer is?  This film looks better than many films I've seen from the 1970s and 1980s.

Christians will be awe-struck and inspired by the wonderful message of The King of Kings, but no one can watch this film and not be impressed by the cinematic artistry and genius on full display.  This is easily the most impressive silent movie I have ever seen.",1109462400,96,4030,4.946587537091988
889303,5,6304483074,"This was the first silent film that I saw in its entire form. The 1927 King Of Kings, directed by Cecil B. Demille. As with D.W Griffth, Charlie Chaplin, and Greta Garbo, he is right up their amoung silent icons. This movie, starring H.B. Warner as Jesus is a truely a jewel of a film. Everyone knows the story, but it is told very well here. Demille knew his bible films, like Ten Commandments(1924,1956) Samson And Delilah and this movie, The King Of Kings. The film maybe dated a tiny bit, but can the story of Jesus be dated. I love Jesus movies, like Jesus Of Nazareth, The Greatest Story Ever Told. The 1961 King of Kings, and the musicals Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell. And the story of Christ was also tackled in the 1916 D.W Griffth classic Intolerence. But this film is broughhow much t out in much better detail. The special effects are amazing for 1927, the crucifixion scene is astondishing,and a scene in color, which is the resurrection scene. The cast of characters is also amazing. In our era of movies, if you need a big scene, a will have only 100 people, and CGI the other tens of thousands. Since there was no CGI back in 1927, or computers for that matter, they directors like Demillie and Griffth had to actually get thousands of extras for there scenes in these epics. I know people think silents are boring but for an 18 year old, they are a gateway to the past. Without those groundbreaking films, no one would care about movies. Those early silents were the catalyst for what would become. I would recommend this film.  This movie is a true classic, no matter what religion you are.",1106524800,8,1615,4.511945392491468
889304,5,6304483074,"I first saw this film my in  teens, and it was a sepia print. I thought then that the film was stodgy and moved very slowly, but it was a worthwile and important film to see. Later I had a dreadful B/W video, which was all fuzzy and faded. Then I had the Kino VHS, which was a clearer print and had the 2-strip Technicolour sequences which bookend the film. NOW I have this magnificent Criterion 2 - DVD set and am just overjoyed. The transfer is clear and crisp, and the Technicolour sequences gleam and glisten. Because I could see more, I found the film to be increasingly enjoyable. The lighting and the mood settings are very effective. The spectacular Cecil B DeMille epic trademark effects are staggering. No matter what you  think of the subject matter, Criterion have now emphasised KING OF KING's historical importance in American Cinema, as well as providing a clear viewing of a film that is thoughtful, reverential, entertaining, moving, instructive & enjoyable. The extras are informative and historically fascinating. I almost felt I was back in 1927 ! I can only hope that Criterion will be able to gain copywright of Cecil B DeMille's other religious silent epic: THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, as well as restoring and presnting on DVD other major silent films: Greed; The Big Parade; Flesh & the Devil; Wings; Ben Hur etc, etc. Thank you  Criterion.

7872834,4,6304483074,"Cecil B. DeMille is the king of classic epics. His color, talkie version of The Ten Commandments (yeah, he also made a black and white, silent version thirty-three years earlier) was a staple of Easter viewing when I was a kid. He also made a biopic of Jesus Christ called The King of Kings thirty-four years before the color, talkie version by some other director. How was DeMille's take on the gospel narratives?

The production values are classic DeMille. In addition to the lavish sets and costumes, two sequences are shot in color--the opening sequence showing the opulent lifestyle of Mary Magdalene and the resurrection sequence near the end of the film. Jesus is often depicted as shining or glowing, which is a bit cheesy to me. Other special effects are amazing, like the casting out of the seven demons from Mary Magdalene and the earthquake at the end of the crucifixion scene. The acting is typical of the silent era with the occasional affected melodramatic pose. H. B. Warner's performance as Jesus is a bit too detached and otherworldly for my tastes but is a choice I understand even if I don't find it inspiring.

The story is mostly faithful to the Scriptures, even using quotes for the dialogue/title cards with chapter and verse cited. The movie is intentionally reverent and an early title card notes Jesus's call to His disciples to spread the news of His life, a mission which this film also wants to serve. The movie's focus is solely on Jesus's public life (so no nativity sequence, alas). Some artistic and narrative liberties are taken. Events are put together in logical rather than chronological sets--when Jesus has to pay the tax (and he has Peter go fishing for a fish that just happens to have a coin in its mouth!) is joined with a pharisee questioning whether it is proper to pay the taxes. The scene concludes with Jesus calling Matthew the tax collector to be an apostle. The biggest creative licenses are Mary Magdalene as a wealthy and independent courtesan who becomes a follower of Jesus and the evangelist Mark being a child whom Christ cures and who follows the Savior throughout the movie. High Priest Caiaphas prays in the temple after the crucifixion that the crime of killing Jesus only be blamed on him and not the Jewish people, mollifying his villainous behavior earlier. These choices are interesting and certainly inoffensive to Christian sensibilities.

The pace of the movie is slow but not boring. I watched the premiere cut that played at Grumman's Chinese theater in 1927 which is 155 minutes long. The Criterion Collection DVD includes that version and the 112 minute general release version of the film.

7872843,4,6304483074,"Not as dreadful as some may fear. True, the gospels' chronology is often scrambled here, with familiar events taking place out of order or in the wrong locations. And a bogus affair between Judas Iscariot and Mary Magdalene has been invented for ""love interest."" And, yes, Mary Magdalene's imperious line ""Harness my zebras!"" may evoke unwanted laughter. Moreover, the moments of anti-Semitism are hard to overlook, but then too, those are there in the gospels themselves.

But despite all this, there is much to admire: The level of acting is very high. H.B. Warner gives a surprisingly naturalistic performance as Jesus (despite the director's semaphoric notions of acting). The charming scene of him ""healing"" a crying child's broken wooden doll -- after all, he was a carpenter --  offers a humanizing moment of humor so rare in this kind of film. Joseph Schildkraut is ostentatiously tortured as Judas; he almost steals the picture. Ernest Torrence makes a strong impression as Simon/Peter.

And there are many visual pleasures in the film: The production design and photography are as good as one could hope for (IMDb credits Mitchell Leisen with Art Direction). Individual memorable effects include the subjective shot seen through the eyes of the blind boy as he is given back his sight in a miracle.

The wonderful 2004 score provided by silent-film master composer Donald Sosin helps the viewer ride over the rough spots and discontinuities in the plotting, without ever slipping into the maudlin religiosity that afflicts so many biblical epics.

Most of all, it's fascinating to see how Jesus's final days were being portrayed in popular culture 90 years ago. Compare this with Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" (2004) or Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (1988).",1505865600,,1798,5.1438356164383565
